0,"&gt; I know it's something little

Since it was obvious that he would find out that you had given him that gift, and that you had left and card he had not received, this is not something little."
1,She’s scared you’re going to leave her after finding out she can’t have kids.
2,"I’m so sorry. Reading all of that, of course you feel down.

You said he makes a good living, yes? Could y’all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house?

Better yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc.

If you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help.

One idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out—it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it’s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well.

TL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along. 

Not that you haven’t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, “I’m unhappy, and I’ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here’s my game plan for how to fix it: I’m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I’m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we’re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.”

Go ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit.

Also, there’s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he’s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he’s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he’s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn’t going to sound great, despite what we’re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex.

Start to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he’s rejecting the idea of couple’s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to lessen. 

Obviously, again, this isn’t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don’t sound like I’m saying this is on you?) but since you’re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family."
3,"&gt;He would be lucky to be able to spend the rest of his life with me.

I started nodding to this. That's the way. You're damn right.

Anyway, there is no closure you can offer outside what you did: grabbed your stuff, left, didn't talk to him. That's about as conclusive as it gets. He wants the opposite of closure, he wants a chance to get his claws in and try and slither his way back into your life. Don't be about that, you've given him much more than he probably deserved, that you didn't nuke his social life was commendable [and for the best]. 

It's tricky though, the intensity and length of his clinging is not something to underestimate. Perhaps a restraining order will provide him the 'closure' he seeks but also provide you with a paper trail just in case things get any more problematic. Speak to the police or a lawyer and consider your options, not to alarm you but rather just so you cover yourself."
4,The relationship isn’t perfectly good if he uses your mental illness as a weapon.
5,"Tina’s only hurting herself in the long run. When this guy moves up in the organization, Tina’s the next logical candidate for his current role - as long as she quits acting so unprofessionally. I’m not saying she has to become the guy’s biggest fan; just quit moaning and whining.

The way Tina behaves now is what upper management will think of when they’re looking at her for other roles. If she can show that she can be professional with someone she doesn’t like, she’s laying the groundwork to show she can be a good team leader in the future."
6,"It sounds like you have a good relationship with your step dad. If you want to talk to him 1-1 to say something to the effect of “I find my mother’s behavior as awful as you do; you’ve been a great presence in my life so far and I would like it if we could maintain our relationship”, that would be totally within your rights."
7,"&gt; We both think that Lisa would be able to twist the situation if Tim took it to anyone above her, and it would reflect badly on him, with possibly dire consequences for his accommodation. What else can we do to deal with this situation?

You are both wrong. He needs to go over her head, immediately, before she can poison that well. Someone in authority needs to know that this situation is happening before she escalates it and gets him kicked out or worse. Which would also mess up his scholarship."
8,"That's a valid thing to want! The thing that worked for you at 19, 29, and 39 doesn't have to work for you at 49. It's not disingenuous if you decide you'd like to be married now. 

Please talk to him about how you're feeling. At the very least, you two should look into your legal options to make sure that you're both protected in a worst case scenario."
9,"Ew no, she is totally fetishizing you and clearly lured you into talking to get fodder for this creepy-ass website. Yikes.

I would just block her. There's not much you can do to get her to take things down, it's notoriously difficult to do that on the internet. It's not worth your time or energy for some niche kidnapping porn website. Your boyfriend is probably just freaked out, but pissing off someone like this could do WAY more harm than good."
10,"I’d just directly bring it up with them. As in ask them right out “so you know Korea is gonna be a completely different experience, what do you think you guys are gonna do for food?” Probably not that bluntly, but I imagine with how picky they all are, some of them must have thought about this problem. And from there if they don’t have their own solutions, maybe stir them towards packing extra things or at least you’ve planted the future problem in their mind. 

I’m saying “you” a lot but really I think your fiancé should handle this. It’s his family after all and I’m assuming he knows all this about them already and knows the issues to come with them travelling abroad. 

To you I’d say dont sweat it. It kinda isn’t your problem at all. It’s not like you’re taking them on a surprise trip to Korea, they know where they’re going and should know their pickiness will mean trouble literally anywhere where there’s food outside their home."
11,"It’s time to end this relationship as many before me said on your previous post. He’s not going to change and his behavior is not okay. Do yourself a favor and break up, you’ll be much happier when it’s over."
12,He pretty much said he doesn't want to be with you and will never marry you. I know you love him and have invested a lot. It would just be better to call it quits and find someone that has the same feelings and goals as you
13,"That's...really weird. So other people who know of the existence of this person just get to continue believing that the person is alive?

What your girlfriend is asking is bizarre and not reasonable.

And similarly, her reaction to you making an honest mistake is abusive.

I'm landing on the side of ""this is not ok"" here."
14,"That was really brave of you, chin up OP :)"
15,"1. As a gay man I can tell you no one makes gayer jokes than straight men.
2. It was nice of him to defend your cousin and I see nothing wrong with that.
3. The fb comment is same as my first point, I don't think any actual gay dude would comment that specially if they know he is married to a woman.
4. This is weird deleting texts. I would keep my eye open but it isnt 100% telling in my opinion.

Have you had any other suspicions aside from this during your marriage?"
16,"&gt;In the past he's gotten mad because he's tried to wake me up but I'm a heavy sleeper and sleep a lot.
🚩

&gt;he says he wishes he had a girlfriend he didn't have to train.
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

&gt;repeatedly talked about how our sex has gotten worse (won't specifically tell me why).
🚩

&gt;I immediately said why are you telling your friends but not me? He said he shouldn't need to put in a formal request for sex and I'm clueless
🚩

&gt;He often lately talks about wishing he had a different girlfriend who cared
🚩
*All of these are huge red flags in any relationship*
You deserve better, nobody deserves to be treated how he's treating you. You just gotta throw the whole boy away."
17,So this happened at two weeks . . . how has she been the past 24 weeks?
18,I would not want that woman around either. Have you tried trying to slyly talk to the husband? When you see him maybe a “I was shocked to hear your wife was forced into the military” and see what he says. I wonder if she would stop knowing these ridiculous claims were making it back to her husband
19,Tell her it bothers you. Not sure she will quit. It’s going to be a hard habit to break. My son does this and I’m trying to break him. At least he won’t do it in public and doesn’t make the noises lol. I’m hoping this gets more replies so I can show him
20,"The point of dating is to find someone who would make a good life partner. Not to pick someone and then hope they turn into a good life partner someday. If being with him makes you so viscerally upset, I think you have your answer."
21,"Its not that you're accustomed to your sisters poor behaviour, its that you've at some level accepted it. She's worn you down and you've lowered your standards. Your wife is still acting like a rational person, you are acting like a hostage to family. 

Be the husband your wife deserves. Stand up to your sister and dont let her hateful hateful comment slide by. 

Your wife has said that evidence of actual change in the form of psychological counselling would be enough for her.... why havent you commented on that anywhere else?"
22,"Her friends are ASSHOLES. 

Look, of course your fiancée is responsible for her own actions and she needs to own them. But when you are that deep in grief, your reactions to things including alcohol are not normal. Her friends should have been looking out for her and taking care of her, not getting her hammered and then having strippers show up."
23,Agreed. Document all of this shit.
24,"The man looked at his crying infant. 

And called you. 

He doesn’t care about your needs. He doesn’t want to make a good home for his child. He wants to have tantrums.

I really want to call this post-partum. Some fits; the persistent talk about camping and being single or living freely. But the rest isn’t. It just isn’t. It’s someone who is leaving their partner, still recovering from birth (it takes a WHILE to feel anywhere near normal or comfy for many) to care for his child. Alone. No help. He takes on what he feels like doing. 

He throws tantrums that risk waking a new baby. He looks at you, exhausted, a new Mum, no help from him, and demands more. “You owe me more” he says while you stand there, the mother of his child, caring for his child with no help or kindness. 

Go to your parents. I would get real distance to think things through. And I think when you do you’ll realize the signs have been there for a while. This is not a quality partner. This is not a kind man. I’m sorry."
25,"“Tina, look. I know you are resentful, but honestly, look at what this guy is doing. This is what they wanted in this job, and if you want to be considered next time, you need to learn from this guy. If you keep complaining you’re gonna get fired, not promoted."
26,"Postdoc in the life sciences here. I've mentored a lot of undergrads so here is my insight.

I think you need to bring Adam in. As the PI, his role is to lead his mentees through disputes with each other. Also, undergrads especially have a lot more respect for the professor/PI. I think as grad students mentoring undergrads we serve this weird role as both a supervisor and peer. This also seems apparent in the way you describe being her friend as well. It seems Adam is already aware of her flaws so I don't think it'll cloud his opinion. As the PI he also gets final say on authorship for papers and presentations coming from his lab and I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate a student passing off work from his lab that she didn't do without a conversation about it first.

Now, how you tell him can control a lot how it goes. You could approach him as a way for him to guide you in your own mentoring abilities on this. You could ask him to have a conversation with her about the importance of plagiarism. Or you could both have a larger conversation about reliability and accountability as a member of the lab which it sounds like given how her time management has been and the way she handled putting this poster together seems like a theme.

Mentoring undergrads is hard. They range a lot in level of commitment of what they give and what they want from lab experiences. They also don't realize sometimes just how busy grad students are and that helping and training them comes at a cost to our own productivity. When it works well, it's so rewarding and awesome to watch someone grow and collaborate. However, unlike grad students who have a huge invested interest in doing well and being productive, undergrads are mostly volunteering and it's hard to motivate someone who doesn't have a lot in the first place. And really can you blame them? She seems to know this experience is just a check box for her med school applications rather than a genuine interest in research.

I think to avoid things like this in the future and for Adam to be totally aware of what's going on in his lab you should tell him and come up with a plan together for the best way to deal with this."
27,"I mean right now she probably thinks you may leave her. I know a lot of men who left there wife or partner after they found out they couldn’t have children. It’s very sad, and sadly she’s probably scared that you are. Comfort her and show her your not going anywhere ! Give her options and plan a life with her this will make her feel more secure ! Telling her won’t be enough you need to show her ! She’s insecure right now it’s your job to build her back up ! This is what marriage is ! She probably had life mapped out and right now that’s all gone so tell her and show her the other options ! Don’t go anywhere ! Don’t make her feel like she can’t give you what you want or need !"
28,The silent treatment is not a valid method of conflict resolution in a healthy relationship.
29,"&gt;I said I'd left a note with it (nothing too fancy, just a little comment and my name) and a few minutes later he replied saying it had been torn up and tossed in the kitchen bin. I know it's something little

UHH, that's really not something little. Has your boyfriend actually directly told Lisa that her actions make him uncomfortable, and asked her to stop? His flatmates seem to support him, so is there any way she could be confronted for her actions? The other stuff can be written off, but the stealing-the-present, ripping up the note and lying about it is honestly absolutely crazy."
30,"What a weird friend group she has to organise this Stripper, then they all just get topless asap, then start spamming her with photos interspersed with “Lol hubby will leave you if he sees THESE omg” messages, they start blowing up your phone when you throw her out, then make apologies, then call you names, then come clean.  
  
Its like the wanted you to break up and then have all this drama and be her seemingly closest allies. Just plain weird"
31,"You didn’t ghost him, you confronted him and left. You aren’t obligated to be chatty to someone who humiliated and betrayed you. If his buddy hadn’t told on him, he would have gone through with the wedding and made a fool of you.

You took on the humiliating job of telling friends and family, you cancelled the wedding arrangements. You have handled this with grace under pressure, you are an actual hero.

But you don’t owe him anything else. Talking to him or meeting him would 100% serve him and likely hurt you. He should feel devastated and remorseful, but it’s too late now. Why should you have to give up your time to make him feel better about cheating on you?

Google how to block/spam his emails and keep doing what you’re doing friend."
32,Are you sure he’s your boyfriend?
33,"Tips for helping kids like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""Oh, I won these in a raffle but they are too small for my kid, do you want them?""

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""We ordered a T-shirt for my son but we accidentally received two, and now he wants to give one to his best friend!""

&amp;#x200B;

etc."
34,"He still doesn't respect you. He respects you so little that he went and fucked another girl, and you're still somehow thinking about how to make this relationship work.

You can do so much better than this guy."
35,"There are problems with every house and most neighborhoods.   He's having anxiety and it may not entirely be about the house.  He may be having anxiety about baby #2 and all these changes and expenses and the house is the easy target to focus on.

The most concerning part is that he is letting himself resent you because  resentment is a harbinger of doom for realtionships.

The two of you need to talk and get to the bottom of things and talk about blaming.  It's ok to have regrets, it's not ok for him to blame you for a decision you made together. Try to keep all emotion out of it and really try to hear him. Talk about options and possible solutions. Make a plan.

You don't have to live there forever. Maybe this is a five year house? Additionally, you can look into and buy a whole house warranty if it may help his anxiety.

I suspect he is having stress/anxiety about money.  Take a look at income and budget and see what can be done to alleviate some of the stress.

If all else fails, please ask to go to marriage counseling. It sounds like a professional really could help him (and you). Something bigger is going on with him and it needs to be addressed before it gets worse.

Best wishes."
36,"I know you said you don't need marriage, but why not just sign marriage papers and skip the wedding part of it all? That way your relationship will get the recognition you want, without all the drama of wedding planning and having a wedding."
37,"&gt;Someone in authority needs to know that this situation is happening BEFORE she escalates it

Just saying it louder for the kids in back. OP sounds afraid Lisa is going to play the victim which is much easier if she makes the first complaint. Tell someone immediately!"
38,"This is a tough one. Can I ask why she wanted to keep the death of this relative private for so long? I can understand not wanting to talk about it for a few weeks, but you say it's been months since the event?"
39,"I’d report it to the police to start a paper trail in case he escalates it,"
40,"After 10 years, moving together and possibly moving again together you guys should be able to have that conversation and talk about things. I don’t think you’re overreacting, but perhaps a good approach moving forward would be to approach him and suggest an exact time and date (like scheduling a meeting) approximately a week in the future where you guys will discuss it more and in detail. Then say that you guys can both spend the next week thinking about stuff, figuring out what you want /what you’re willing to do etc,. but that you won’t bring it up before the meeting date. Good luck"
41,I'm sorry he brought up these old wounds and tried to make it your fault.
42,Honestly it sounds like he’s cheating on you again.  And he almost certainly is still lying.  He told you he felt coerced into sex because he knew it would hurt you and he wanted you to back off.
43,Its probably because Erin doesn't have many friends and is excited to form a bond with someone and is going too far in trying to validate that bond.
44,Your parents have shown you a great example of how trying to help someone can backfire and leave you holding the bag.
45,So there is a pattern of abusive behavior and explosive anger on her part. This is not a healthy relationship.
46,You should tell them to seek reproductive counselling before making their decisions and tell them you can provide them with all the information you have available about your family history. They can make their decisions on the advice of their doctors.
47,Proud of you for ditching his cheating ass
48,"She’s probably embarrassed that you can give her kid stuff she can’t. My dad would get extremely upset if I said my friend bought me a phone (I lied because I used my lunch money to save up for it) and ranted about how he’s my parent and if he can’t afford it then I shouldn’t have it etc. What you did was incredibly kind and generous. My friends parents would always buy me food if I was invited out, some people view it as the polite/right thing to do but it’s not expected of them. I guess if the situation was reversed she wouldn’t do the same for your kid so she finds it bizarre. You also mention she might have problems so I wouldn’t take anything she says to heart. Don’t feel bad, you did a nice thing."
49,"If someone has sex with a person who is too drunk to consent, we call it sexual assault."
50,"Is he legally allowed to be around children?  If not, I’d be reporting his ass for that."
51,"His convictions are already pretty shaky. It’s ridiculous to blame you for “letting” him do what’s in his own power to control. 

Being a willing participant and then blaming you for his own guilt is a shitty thing to do."
52,"Okay so this is a classic George Costanza method of breaking up.

You pretend you're a moron and pick your weapon.  In this case the weapon were the Cheetos.  You drive the other person mad by playing a dumbass and step by step slowly driving them mad.    The goal is to get the other person to break up with you so that you don't have to.

That or he's an actual moron and/or doesn't care about your preferences much."
53,None of this makes any sense. I think we're missing a cultural reference.
54,"Yup. Keep a separate journal of her actions, the date, and time. 

OP, you need to secure any belongings you have at Tim's place, and you guys might consider spending alone time in Tim's room or in a place where Lisa can't impede on your time together. 

Speak with the housing director or the RA director. If she is in a position of authority regarding other students, her supervisor needs to be made aware of her predatory and irresponsible behavior. Ideally, she will be moved to a different housing unit, and/or be stripped of her authority in the housing units."
55,"THIS. OP, he's being so cruel to you. Please leave and find someone who doesn't treat you like a burden."
56,"&gt;&gt; don’t know if I even should bring this up with Tina, or how to go about it if I do.

If Tina's mother's behavior is causing gossip within the industry, I would definitely bring it up to her. ""Tina, mutual friend x has let me know that people are gossipping about your mom coming to your interviews. I don't want to seem like I'm spreading gossip and I don't want to hurt you, but this is really affecting your reputation and the industry is so small that I'm concerned about your ability to get a job."""
57,"&gt;My parent get their feelings hurt pretty easily 

And they make sure that everyone else knows about it. Right? 

When you’ve grown up around parents like this, it’s easy to excuse  their shenanigans as normal behavior because you’re used to it. Your wife, however, is not. She doesn’t want to be yelled at when your dad gets “excessively angry”. She doesn’t want to walk on eggshells to avoid Mom &amp; Dad getting hurt feelings. 

I think you have to respect that your wife doesn’t enjoy your parents’ company and she’s smart enough to distance herself and let you spend time and be with them without her suffering through it and ruining your visit with them. If they get their feelings then that’s too bad but it’s not your wife’s responsibility to set herself on fire to keep them (or you) warm."
58,"The gist is that she did something 22 weeks ago, deleted the photo soon after, and you are still mad at her.

This is not about your girlfriend or the photo. If it was, you'd have used your words, discussed it with  her, and then decided if the relationship was worth moving on from this. 

Instead, you've held on to this ""wrong"" she did you.  Think about why you want that. If I couldn't ""forgive"" someone for doing something two weeks after dating, I would not want to keep seeing them - dating someone while still pissed at them months later sounds shitty for both of you."
59,Thx! Dont regret it one bit :)
60,"&gt; We’ve probably hung out one on one maybe 10 times in our entire relationship.

Why are you calling him your boyfriend? He's barely an acquaintance. He doesn't give a shit about you, OP. Ditch this loser."
61,"So I'm going to be harsh here... Is your wife always this uh, stupid? You say she's naive but I'm a military spouse and can't get over her saying that military vehicles somehow work wildly different than ""civilian cars"". Just wow.

You can't change anything crazy lying neighbor says or does, but you really have to have a serious talk with your wife, especially since this has now affected your finances with the car. Maybe couples counseling? Hopefully they have a chaplain available that provides those services on your base. If it's just loneliness causing your wife to cling to this woman, she should probably find a hobby group or something instead."
62,"Hey man, I had a similar experience - when I was 16 my group of friends essentially had an intervention and let me know my defensiveness and argumentativeness was driving them away. Now, nearing 30, I am beyond grateful that I had friends who had the guts to be honest with me and give me a chance. I asked them to point out when I was doing it and respected them when they did.

Now I make a point of inviting quiet people to speak in groups because I am aware that people like me drown out important voices that may be too timid to speak up when a bunch of loudmouths like myself are arguing. That one conversation changed my life for the better. I am glad you are being given the opportunity to see how  your behaviour affects others from another perspective. You will slip up, but growing up is all about generally trending upward in behaviour, not being perfect!"
63,"It's a simple question, and one any responsible adult should know the answer to if they're sexually active.  That she dodges the answer, discourages you from asking, and *told you you'd be lucky to be her baby daddy* is a pretty clear, if indirect, answer!  So if you're serious about not fathering a child, you should reconsider sleeping with this woman in the future."
64,The ability to handle rejection gracefully is really the mark of a good man
65,"&gt; I just keep carrying this guilt because now my boyfriend doesn’t have a place to live. Some of his other family members have offered him a place to live, but he says he doesn’t want to be a burden on them. 

So he HAS places to go, but he refuses to take them. 

You have to prioritize your child here. She’s the only one who has no control over this situation. Your boyfriend will be fine once he gets over himself. Take your family’s generous offer and work on saving money and re-gaining your independence. You can figure out where that leaves your relationship later."
66,"All the advice people are giving you is great, but one more thing.  Don't respond to him at all.  The only thing he should receive from you is a cease and desist letter.  Giving him any response,  positive or negative,  will just encourage him."
67,"Don't confront her, do end the friendship/ghost/fade/block her, download the website with those comments in pdf form and save it just in case she escalates and you need it as evidence of stalking in the future."
68,"'we have come across an opportunity for us that is too good to pass up, and we are taking it.'


short. sweet. to the point."
69,"This is a very delicate situation, and still has the potential to seriously turn on you. Ideally it would be great to remove the situation altogether, either by having her no longer tagging along with you or maybe getting assigned to another floor. Is there a feasible way to go about either one?"
70,"&gt; that you didn't nuke his social life was commendable 

TIL I'm petty af because omg, if someone I was going to marry in TEN DAYS cheated on me and his friends/family asked why I was cancelling the wedding.... well I'd literally give them a play-by-play of everything he did in one massive group chat. I'd also include how he sugar coated it by saying it was his 'last night of freedom'. 

OP definitely has way more self-control than me lol."
71,"Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going on. That doesn't change my comment at all."
72,"A real ""catch"" doesn't need to tell you they're a catch. A real catch is someone who is too busy loving and respecting the catch **you** are to boast about how great they are.

Your boyfriend is getting hella narcissistic. He has to change himself, and if he isn't willing and wants to, instead, keep tearing YOU down... He's the opposite of the catch he thinks he is and it's best to let him go date his mirror."
73,"So... her ""friends"" got her super drunk and then brought in a stripper to sexually assault her, then sent the photos to her with huge guilt trip messages saying you will leave her if you find out. It sounds like she's dealing with both sexual assault and a huge deliberate betrayal by her friends that was 100% intended to break you guys up. It's wrong that she didn't tell you immediately that she was assaulted but that's not uncommon when things like that happen. You feel betrayed, sure, but I would be more pissed at her ""friends"". Call off the wedding, but also please talk this out in counseling."
74,"This plus she’s grieving the life she thought she was going to have or at least have a choice to have. Through no fault of her own, a major component of our biology has been taken away. 

Both of you could benefit from therapy, individual and couples.  

As a woman that struggled for years from infertility (not exactly same thing), I’d recommend that you show her how you still feel about her in her love language. She needs reassurance that you still love and desire her despite a nonfunctional uterus."
75,"You don't have to manage your ex's feelings, you're just choosing to. Even in the smallest of programs, you don't have to put up with this if you don't want to. Ignore him and stop talking to him. If he bothers you, contact the program director."
76,"There's lots of good advice here, so I'm going to focus on something else: stop blaming yourself for not shutting him down earlier. We have an expectation that people will act in certain polite and normal ways in social situations, and when people defy those expectations, we can be slow to react. We don't anticipate the crazy creepers going as far as they eventually do because we tend to think well of people and their intentions. 

As women we are conditioned to feel like we caused men's bad behavior by something we did or didn't do, but that's a faulty conclusion. Perhaps if you'd responded to him in some ideal manner, his creepiness would not have gotten to this point, but you are human, you didn't know, he is responsible for himself and you have no reason whatsoever to feel responsible for the escalation of his behavior. This is entirely on him."
77,"This is going to sound brutal, but your boyfriend is a jerk. It's not ok to expect that you should wake up in the middle of the night whenever your boyfriend is horny and be perfectly happy to get it on with him. It's not ok to continually criticise your sex life without communicating what he actually wants or needs. It's not ok to make you feel ashamed of your sexual history or to tell you he wished he had a different girlfriend who met his standards (which sound impossible, even if he won't communicate them). If it's not abuse, it's borderline abuse. Please leave."
78,"It’s not your job to be the gatekeeper. If he feels so strongly that ancient texts are the blueprint for moral behavior then it’s his responsibility to control his own urges. 

You were smart to insist on condoms at least, because if you get pregnant he’s not going to be ok with any course of action other than having the baby."
79,"So you wrote him a letter about how you feel disconnected from him and like you can't communicate with him without him shutting down.  He responded by dismissing your letter and shutting down any prospect of a follow up as if his mom's broken ankle prevents him from doing so.  At a certain point, you've just got to look past the excuses and at the facts of your relationship.  He's telling you who he is, and what his priorities are.  You should listen, because how he responded to you is as much of an answer to your concerns as it would be if he opened a serious discussion on the specific points you bring up.  You've just got to be willing to listen to what he's saying, and he's saying he doesn't care about you."
80,"Straight men are OBSESSED with gay jokes and “inappropriate” touching (so many straight dudes slap each other’s asses and pretend to grope each other), it’s so weird.

Tbh, no closeted person (gay or bi) would be this over the top."
81,"&gt;...he felt pressured because it was ""his last night of freedom""

This is such a bullshit line and excuse. I don't understand why any man or woman would think this going into marriage. If a person is thinking this at any point after engagement then they should be calling it off. Obviously they are not ready to commit to a monogamous relationship. If you want freedom, go be single."
82,"Sounds to me like something you should just get over. Unless it's a strict requirement for you that you only date virgins, you're gonna have to face the fact that your partners have had others before you. Yeah, she made a mistake 2 weeks into the relationship, but as long as that behavior isn't habitual or intended to hurt you, then it's really only as big an issue as you decide it will be."
83,"People are already thoroughly debating if there was enough info to determine whether the thing with the dog is abuse or discipline and whether he was properly defending your honor with the fist fight thing, so I'll look at this from more of an overall perspective.

It sounds like in both instances, whatever the Internet's consensus winds up being, you feel unheard. If you have a feeling in your gut that something isn't quite right, you don't have to stay. Maybe he was just disciplining the dog, maybe he is noble for defending your underwear, maybe he's usually generous and career-oriented. But none of that matters if it doesn't feel right to you or you feel uneasy. You are allowed to leave for whatever incompatibility you sense will bring you stress long-term. Personally I don't see ""thick skin towards violence"" as something everyone needs to have, so if you don't want to keep having this conversation...don't."
84,"&gt; Sometimes my boyfriend says things like ""no one else would have stayed with you"" and ""I don't know why I even help you"".

Yeah a romantic partner saying nobody else is going to love you is a red flag OP.  Actually it isn't so much a red flag as a bright blinking arrow pointing to the words ""abuse"".

To answer your question OP, no the relationship isn't worth salvaging if he's saying that nobody else is going to love you and that he doesn't know why he helped you at all.  

Also even without this abuse, OP - if you want marriage, and he doesn't, then it's okay to say the relationship isn't going to work out and break up.

Marriage is a hell yes scenario.  If he isn't interested, then that's your answer.  Break up, find somebody who will hell yes to your ""do you want to get married"".  (But in this case your decision is a bit easier cause your boyfriend is waving red flags)"
85,"&gt; Am I overreacting? He did say “he wants to be with me forever” but it wasn’t too convincing. 

No, you're not overreacting. You've turned around your life already once to be with him. Moving a second time without even having any sort of commitment from his side is concerning. Yes, you're still young, but at 26 after a decade, your bf should know what he wants."
86,"Get rid of this guy, I’m begging you. There are so many red flags, it just generally sounds like he doesn’t care about your needs or feelings, or your baby’s, and can only see a very narrow and selfish view of the world. I’d leave the home for a few days and tell him to consider therapy or a divorce. Cutting your wedding ring in half is just childish and awful."
87,Maybe she’s in a weekend at Bernie’s situation and you blew her cover
88,"End it, how is any of this resolved?!?

IMO if he was emotionally invested in/committed to you AT ALL he would not be able to bring himself to sleep with someone else the same day. He is gaslighting you AGAIN that it is because of what YOU said that he cheated by saying he thought you broke up with him. If he gave a hoot if you did actually break up, he would have asked for clarification."
89,Side note: I love how you wrote and organized the post as if it were an academic paper. I give you an A+.
90,"And she could probably use some therapy sessions, solo and with you, OP. This is a big deal for her, there's no shame in getting professional help to cope with the change in expectations."
91,What a jackass! How were you supposed to know what happened to his mom if he hadn’t told you about it? It really just sounds he’s trying to guilt you out of expressing your feelings because he doesn’t want to deal with them
92,"&gt;How was the relationship before the baby came and before you got pregnant?


Probably not good, because op says this:

&gt;There is so much background, like with all relationships, that I could write a novel

Unless it's a really, really boring novel, this just isn't true of ""all relationships""."
93,"Consider that he could be attracted to the confidence with which you carry yourself when you're in shape.  When you gained the weight, the way you acted may have changed.  While you wanted sex, it sounds like he's attracted to when you're taking care of yourself.  50 pounds gained wass 50 pounds of no longer caring for yourself the way you did at the beginning.  That can permeate past looks."
94,Holy shit I wouldn't know how I would react. Why do you think she believes her over you?
95,Yeah at this point he's the customer service guy just waiting for you to hang up
96,"My boyfriend had his roommate give him the dog. 

Basically just be like, “Hey, I’m going to give you a lot of time to think about this so you don’t feel pressured at all but I love [dogs name]. I’m moving out in [time frame] and I would love to become the dogs owner. They would get the absolute best care in the world. But it is your dog and I know you want what is best for them. You can absolutely say no, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m more than willing and would love to be their owner. Take some time to think about it before you say yes or no. “"
97,"something to take into account -- your mom is still deeply traumatized from this event to the point where she cannot go onto said street.  if she finds this out, she may be reminded of the incident every time she looks at your boyfriend.  maybe wait and see"
98,"Ok, straight up, she's not a budget person. There's people like that. She can't visualize credits and debits and writing them down is distasteful to her.

The one suggestion I've made to friends struggling with money that way, that had actually helped, is this: multiple accounts. Have an account for bills. It cannot be used, ever, except for bills. Have an account for consumables. This is food, toilet paper, toothpaste, tampons, etc. Have an account for spending. This is your fun stuff. Games, movies, toys, dates, eating out, etc. Have an account for saving. This doesn't get touched for anything small. Minimum amount it must be at to spend, and only on big things (vacation, large purchases, etc).

It's easier to show her 'we're out of money' when you literally are out of money. Hard to fight a $0 balance. Also lets you say ""if we do this, we will be out until next paycheck."""
99,"Is your hobby part of an organized or structured group? If so, try going to the person in charge and telling them about how Paul is behaving. They might remove him from the group or otherwise have a way to curb his behavior. 

If it isn't, I suggest going to the police and filing a report. You have told him to stop contacting you and he refused, which puts this in harassment territory."
100,"I do not think you should reach out to her.  It really sounds like the relationship had issues and that this is a reaction to you missing being with ""somebody"" and not actually you missing her.

&gt;I immediately realized how upset I was with where I was at. With my finances, my body, how well I kept my apartment. 

You should definitely stay in therapy and continue to work on all of these issues that you recognize within yourself.   You need to fix them before you can be ready for a healthy relationship.   Somewhere down the line, after you've fixed this stuff, you may have another chance to see if it could be right with this girl but it's not right with her right now so leave her alone and focus on yourself."
101,"This made me tear up. I’m 46 and I dated my “boyfriend” for six years until he died two years ago. I was not in the obituary (placed by his parents who he wasn’t that close to) or mentioned anywhere, and it really fucking hurt and still does to a strange and intense degree. I even called the poor obituary reporter and asked for a correction, and he said since I wasn’t next of kin he had to go with what A’s mother said. It was like I was erased, and it really really hurt."
102,"You’re never not going to have schizophrenia, so it sounds like he is never going to marry you. If your goal is marriage, this relationship is a waste of time."
103,"Yeah, so...what the hell are you doing? You two are obviously ready to break up, why are you worried about how to get past him cheating on you? Why are you asking if his behavior is 'acceptable'? It's obviously not, you two obviously are not working out, this obviously needs to end. So be the bigger person who can see past all this bullshit, and formally end it. You'll thank yourself for it once everything settles down and you've gotten back in touch with yourself."
104,"My (now) wife and I were in a similar place after she finished grad school and was going to move cross country. We had this talk. She didn’t want me to come and just be a boyfriend. She asked what I felt and I said that I’d like to be more serious with marriage and kids in the future. We’re married 30 years now. 

I tell you all this because when the time came for the talk I was 100% in favor and let her know in no uncertain terms. If you aren’t hearing that then I’d consider moving on without him."
105,"I think that this simply isn't your problem. They are grown ups who will be able to use Google or Yelp to find something they like to eat and even if they don't, you still don't need to feel obligated to help them. This is their problem -- extremely picky eaters can fend for themselves and are likely used to finding most restaurant food ""unacceptable."""
106,"Also, she's got to look at the silver lining. This could be an opportunity to grow. It sounds like this dude is making real change and he's going to go far, here is a chance to get to learn directly from him and also take advantage of the new trails that he is blazing. Now that morale is up and everybody is more open-minded towards change, this could be a chance for her to take her own initiatives and get buy-in from management and from her peers.

Long term, this guy is probably going to leave this company in 3 to 5 years for bigger things. It's not worth sabotaging her entire career just because one time she got beat out for a position."
107,How was the relationship before the baby came and before you got pregnant?
108,"&gt;how has she been the past 24 weeks

yeah, I'm wondering the same. We are human and are allow to make mistakes. At two weeks at dating, some people aren't too certain about the relationship yet. How are her actions the other 24 weeks? was this a consistent thing or just a one time thing is what I want to know?"
109,"You can contact him, but you need to walk a very fine line between human and professional, and keep it really, really short. That's the best way to be kind and respectful of him.

You thank him for mentoring you and supporting you  -- but not for 'getting you the job'. You've earned the job you've got at this point, so don't make yourself less than what you are.

You tell him you'd like to stay in touch, and that your offer to babysit is still open. 

You don't say things like ""at this rough time for you"" or ""I wouldn't have this job if not for you!"" or ""I feel so bad far you.""

Don't ask for, or expect, a response. You probably won't get one."
110,"It sounds like a case of ""She's not thst into you"".  The concerning thing isn't that she went out with friends but that she's probably fibbing about what she's doing with some of her free time when she's turning you down.  She doesn't care enough to make spending a couple hours with you a priority.

Just tellher that you've realized that dating her isn't going to work out, and thrn move on."
111,"The only thing I do regret was that she texted me afterwards saying that she was sorry about earlier and that she hoped we were still cool. I wanted to respond right away but I didn’t want to write a sloppy message so I took about an hour to reply . I told her “Hey! Don’t feel sorry 😅, I’m actually glad I did that! And yeah, we’re definitely still chill. “. I regret sending that a bit sooner ."
112,"I have seen plenty of people react poorly to a disappointment in their career, and this bad behavior put them permanently out of the running for future opportunities.  

&amp;#x200B;

As a friend, you could say to Tina, preferably with respect to a specific behavior, ""I understand your are disappointed, but complaints like this are going to give people a negative impression of you.""  You can also try to set limits on how much complaining you're willing to listen to during your non-work time, but the more urgent problem, it seems to me, is to keep her from losing her job over this.  

&amp;#x200B;

Really, her supervisor or manager should be the one talking to her about this.  If they are thinking of firing her then they should be talking to her about the problem and giving her a chance to get it together."
113,"Cop here.  We get this a lot more than you think.  If you know which town he lives in call the police of HIS town.  Have then do a welfare check in him.  Tell them what he sent to you.  He probably needs some sort of mental health evaluation.  

If you want it documented/reported in fear of him coming to you the. Go to YOUR local police of where you reside and make a report there for harassment.

Block on all forms of social media."
114,"It sounds to me like he's trying to demoralize you into being grateful for whatever pittance he offers you as a settlement during the divorce.

I think you're supposed to respond to that by getting the very best divorce lawyer you can manage, to make sure that you're treated fairly - because your husband has made it plain that he won't be doing so, otherwise.

And then therapy. Because it sounds like he's been disrespecting your for some time now, and you deserve to be respected, and to respect yourself."
115,"&gt; he’s jobless at this time. He also doesn’t have a drivers license, mainly because he’s never wanted to get one

Your boyfriend doesn't have a place to live because he's a scrub, and people get tired of dealing with a mooch. He'll be sofa surfing all his life until finally nobody takes him on and then he'll be homeless. Is that really who you want to saddle yourself with? Get a job and do better for yourself without that loser."
116,"People forget that kissing is not a universal gesture and it’s interpretation is heavily dependent on culture. In American culture, kissing is seen as a romantic gesture. In some regions, kissing is just seen as a way to greet others. In many parts of the world, kissing is equated to spitting in someone else’s mouth and is seen as disgusting and unacceptable in every situation. 

Because of how subjective actions like hugging and kissing are, you are going to receive a lot of different reactions towards it. I think you should talk to your boyfriend about your two families cultural differences so there are fewer misunderstandings in the future."
117," I agree with the poster who said you should bring it up without embarrassing or shaming her for it. She most likely sucks her thumb for self-soothing purposes or just what she has done in her ""idle"" time. If she's self aware, she probably already knows it's abnormal for her age and might feel insecure about it. The noises when she ""goes at it"" would be extremely obnoxious and irritating to me though. You can't make her stop completely. But it's reasonable to bring it up and ask if she can stop doing that around you. She might not notice it's bothersome to you."
118,"You seem to have the best outcome possible to be honest.

I would have gladly accept this quiet acceptance over the messy, violent and downright hurtful breakups I've personally endured.

Hoping you'll be able to both move on from this. But bear in mind his lack of response could mean he may later respond to you in time, either from regret or from a drinking binge, etc.

Anyway, take care."
119,Why does she need a sitter at 14? I *was* a sitter at 14.
120,"&gt;In Colorado it is (a bullshit) state law they have to mandatorily arrest one of the parties 

That's not bullshit at all, man.  It keeps people from being fucking murdered when the cops leave."
121,She reacts to things this way to punish you. She is treating you like a dog and rubbing your nose in your mistakes. I used to be like this and I'm very ashamed now. I thought another person being in the wrong was an opportunity to really unleash all the resentment I felt towards them. (Secret: That kind of behavior is cruel and fucked up. I figured that out and changed. Do you think your gf could change?)
122,"The head of maintenance already took you aside to talk about this, so get him on board. If you can't think of a pretext to keep her away then maybe he can. Health and safety regulations, you're paid to be maintenance and not a babysitter, whatever. It's easier to shield yourself from a situation when you have your own management looking out for you."
123,"Great response, don't feel bad about the timing. As a girl I cant stress enough how meaningful it is for us to feel it's okay to say no without having to endure unpleasant repercussions. You behaved gracefully and maturely, and I appreciate that on her behalf :) all the best to you!"
124,"This is the best comment on this thread. I also wanted to add there's a chance your husband feels highly guilty about passing on Asperger's and/or autism to his children, especially if you said he seems like he might have it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a mental disorder, which causes me a lot of pain, and I've essentially considered that passing it onto a kid is too big of a risk; with my last girlfriend I basically said I wouldn't have children until I could afford ""Gattaca babies"" (modifying to minimize the risk of the disorder), and with my current one we've realized we aren't so sure about even having kids, since she also has numerous health problems. That kind of guilt is heavy on anyone."
125,"My ex’s sister told me her brother is a “saint” for taking care of his first wife while she was dying of brain cancer.  Yet, when I married him, he was verbally and emotionally abusive to the point I had to leave.  Just because someone does something good, that doesn’t mean that they can then get a free pass to hurt others.  

Your bf is basically done at this point.  He really should have left sooner if he wasn’t interested in continuing under the circumstances."
126,"&gt;He asked if he could do it if he promises to pull out and I said no.  
&gt;  
&gt;He asked if he could do it for just a minute and I said no.  
&gt;  
&gt;He asked if he could just put the tip in and I said no.  
&gt;  
&gt;He got really frustrated and asked why he couldn't even just for a second  
&gt;  
&gt;He told me he'd buy the morning after pill if I needed it

This sounds utterly exhausting, and I am concerned by his pushing back against the boundaries you are setting. Suggesting Plan B as an alternative to condoms is really messed up, especially since you cannot use hormonal birth control for health reasons. What if you decide to let him have unprotected sex with you (not that ""letting someone"" have sex with you is good consent) and he decides he wants to come inside you, too? Someone who is willing to push boundaries this much is not someone I would trust to have unprotected sex with. Please be careful that he isn't stealthing you."
127,"Communication wins again! Good job, I'm glad she took it well."
128,"He sounds like the kind of guy who says ""All my exes are crazy!"" when in fact, he deliberately made sure to create situations where he could blame them for being 'crazy'. 

You can only trust your own instincts here, but if you suspect he's gas lighting you and trying to create drama where he's can play the victim, you need to get rid of him. 

Even if you don't believe that completely, the suspicion is a big enough of an issue that you shouldn't live with him."
129,"The tack I took when my youngest brother was dating a drug dealing drunk driving disaster was *""you can have a relationship with whoever you want. I will not have a relationship with this person, and until my kid is old enough to decide for themselves I will not allow a relationship between kid and that disaster of a human being. Do not bring them around us/our kid and we will not be attending events you bring them too. I want you to have a good relationship with kiddo so as long as you are alone/not with [disaster] you are welcome to join us anytime""*

In your case I would personally take a **hard** stance on no pictures as well as no contact. Your parent and sister have to 100% respect that boundary. Like you want this man to have no contact, no images, nothing. You should definitely show pictures of **him** to your kid though and teach your kid that he is unsafe and untrustworthy."
130,"This, OP. *Please* do not confront her. If you do, you can expect to see the conversation reproduced on her website along with a bunch of made-up bullshit designed to make you look crazy and score more attention for her.

Actually, I wouldn't even fully ghost. Just start feeding her excuses for why you're busy every time she asks. Vet appointment. Big test. Trip with boyfriend. Just so so so busy with work. Don't give her a ""moment"" that she can pin down as the exact time you dumped her and it will let the air out of her balloon. She'll keep hoping to regain her access to you, but you've decided that time will be never."
131,"Don't confront Suzie.

If you don't care about her personal life, or Rick's, go on not caring.

If your impression is right and Suzie is enjoying putting on a little show, the surest way to punish her is to decline to be an audience member. The best thing you and your co-workers can do is decline to give her any attention over this issue, either positive or negative. Be merrily oblivious to her little stunts and simply enforce professionalism in the office."
132,"You’re not wrong here. She’s a grieving mother who thinks her only connection to her dead son is his child, and she’s lashing out because she’s afraid to lose him. But it’s not sustainable to have two kids and an adult share one bedroom, and your mental health is important too. I would reassure her that you want to keep in contact with her, and will make a plan to have your son visit her regularly or have her come visit Australia, set up regular Skype dates for her to talk to him, etc. 

Then—be wary that she might try to gain custody of your son by claiming that she’s been raising him and you are “unfit” because of your grief. If you are going to do this move, do it right now before she has a chance to get a lawyer."
133,"Ugh that is so frustrating. I dealt with someone who was dating a close friend who was similar to that. It was really hard. 

One way I combatted it was just to say “you’re joking!” Light heartedly or “I don’t believe that” or “that can’t be true” in a tone of good natured disbelief and then when she doubles down say “ that sounds so far fetched I can hardly believe it” or “prove it” also in a light hearted slightly teasing tone. 

Example:
Friend: I was sentenced to the military instead of prison
You: whaaaat? That can’t be true
Friend: it is!
You: I can’t believe that you gotta show me some proof 
If she says that she will show you proof but can’t because of x y z just file it away

Then if she brings it up again say “oh you still have to show me the pictures/ whatever from when you are in prison! It seems like such a crazy story I just have to see it!”

Another thing is to document what your wife says she said. Her story will change often, so it’s good to have texts. 

Anyways I’m sorry, this sucks. Good luck, and keep us updated."
134,"You responded far more than I would have. He kept trying to push buttons in each response. When you responded and disproved what he said, he'd change topic and throw something different at you. 

Doesn't seem like there is anything worth talking to him about from what I see in those messages. You're right to block him and move on."
135,"Please remember that this is a high school girl who will likely be haunted by this the rest of her life. Your brother killed himself because he was mentally ill. Lots of people get cheated on and don’t do this. I know it feels good to lay blame, but is that what he’d really want you to do?"
136,"I'm sorry but she is being unreasonable.  You made a mistake, you immediately told her about it and apologized for it.  people make mistakes. Her reaction for a 40 year old person is over dramatic.  

&amp;#x200B;

If she doesn't want to talk about the death of a relative, then she just expresses that on her own.  She doesn't have to talk about the details of how, but to not be able to say the person died is not reasonable.  It's denial."
137,Imagine if you acted at her the way she is behaving toward you. Do you think she would be understanding and diplomatic if you cried and said you expected better of her?
138,"He’s upset because he’s trying to tell himself he’s not intending to have sex again and it only happens accidentally. Your doing something to be prepared removes that illusion and makes him have to deal with the fact that he is in his eyes intentionally sinning. Instead of dealing with that, he decided to lessen the guilt by offloading his responsibility for managing his behavior onto you. I bet if you poked around you’d find he thinks like many evangelical Christians that men are more likely to be “tempted” to have sex than women and that women want sex less and are more capable of resisting. This means also that you are a nonstandard women and possibly more sinful than most. Pedestals are not comfy. 

I grew up in this culture and left it but didn’t get far enough. Be really sure you know what you’re getting into before you get married. This guy’s failure to take responsibility for his own actions is a serious flaw. I think over time it will turn into bitterness and blame against you."
139,"Completely agree. I’m a PhD as well, in industry now. I would approach Adam and say something like “I want to make you aware of a situation that happened with undergrad in case you think further intervention is necessary”. 

OP, at this point you don’t even now if she actually re-did her poster or just changed a couple of things again so she could get it to the printer. It would be best for Adam to know what he’s walking into if he goes sees her poster and it turns out it looks almost exactly like yours. You need to preemptively cover your read end."
140,"&gt;  He used to hit us when we were younger, he used to hit my mum as well

Hoo boy, this is one of the biggest buried ledes I've ever seen here. You are all abuse survivors and everyone handles that trauma differently. Often the oldest kids get it the worst. It's very normal for one or multiple children to reconcile with an abusive parent and for that to push the other child even further away, feeling alone in their continuing anger toward that parent and perhaps even feeling like they're somehow broken or crazy because they're the only one who seems traumatized by the past.

Have you ever talked to him about your shared childhood and the abuse? My upbringing was not nearly as bad as yours, but my dad also had anger issues and it really separated us emotionally as kids. Talking to my brother about our past as adults was a way for us to bond, and we both realized a lot of shit happened to each of us separately that the other didn't know about. Your brother may well have gone through a lot that you don't have any inkling of.

Your brother definitely could use therapy but it's going to take a gentle touch if that's going to happen. I think therapy might be a good idea for you too, and they can give you more information and tools for dealing with the fallout of your specific familial abuse."
141,"Why exactly is a 14 year old kid hanging out with her Mom while she’s working?  He said she had a “prominent position”, but this whole scenario is weird."
142,"Going to go against the grain here and tell you to bypass the school admin/resource officer and contact the local police first. It might sound paranoid but some schools have gone to insane depths to protect terrible teachers. 

Please reach out to your parents or another trusted adult in your life as well. Don't isolate yourself; you need people in your corner."
143,"But he’s already proven to you that he’s untrustworthy with your nudes - he lied and took screenshots when he promised he wouldn’t.

You are correct in not trusting him with your nudes.

If that makes him upset, tough shit.  If his feelings get hurt by the consequences of being untrustworthy, perhaps he should stop being untrustworthy."
144,"All the red flags.

He wants someone to satisfy HIS needs, and doesn’t seem to care much about how they feel or what they want. 

He has problems, refuses to communicate, and refuses to help solve them- placing all the blame solely on OP. 

Dump him, he’s not a good partner. And yes, it is that simple. 

Want to know why so many people in this sub advocate breaking up? Because we’ve been there, ignored the red flags, convinced ourselves they were small problems by ignoring the underlying character traits and incompatibilities that caused them. We’ve learned from experience, and have learned it’s not worth it."
145,"Yeah, this. It's so strange that adults can't pull themselves together and make such a fuss when it comes to food... But it's definitely not your problem. I know it's hard (because I'd probably worry too haha), but try not to think of it too much and enjoy your wedding :) it's all about you and your future hubby now."
146,"Thank you for being such an understanding, emotionally intelligent person. Also you were so brave to go out on a limb like that!!"
147,"Don’t start with bringing up sperm donation or adoption because the implication is that they shouldn’t have biological children (which isn’t your decision to make). Similarly, don’t assume they want to have children and that, if they do, they want to have biological children (your post doesn’t say). I’d suggest you instead just mention to him “you know schizophrenia is heredity and I know you know it runs in our family due to your aunt and sister. I’m not sure you know about how many other relatives there are in the family but I recently found out about a history of X, Y and Z. There are a lot of implications due to this, for example more extreme caution if using certain substances and implications involving having children. If you and wife are planning to have biological children it may make sense to talk to a doctor about this family history to learn more about what it means and further implications.”"
148,"I think you should talk to a professional about your feelings. 

It's hard to say much more than that. But I do find it disconcerting that you have an idealized version of your perfect family and you're letting that affect how you feel and possibly how you treat your actual family. 

Perhaps it's because of the way you've worded it, and I'm more than happy to admit when I'm way off base, but something about this post I find really disturbing. I hope you get some insights from others here, too."
149,"You are literally feeding him and managing his schedule like his mommy.

You need to cut this out. He's 30 years old. If he wants to behave like a toddler, he should go be do time-out by himself.

You're enabling his sexist laziness, and if you marry him it's just gonna be like this forever."
150,"&gt;Some of them beg for closure

Really fucking annoys me when people who blatantly did you wrong want ""closure"" what the fuck do you mean closure? Closure happened when your dick ended up in someone else' hands? 

Closure doesn't fucking mean sitting down and verbally saying ""we're done"" .... closure is the event that closes the door on the relationship."
151,"I think it's possibly unreasonable to have not dumped him 5 months ago when you caught him in bed with another female. The company at the anniversary supper is, like, the least of your problems.

You accepted his actions 5 months ago. You've decided to keep him. This is the way the cookie crumbles. Random Reddit people can't really change it for you and all the advice is pretty much going to be the same. 

Only you can do something about it. DTMFA."
152,"Securing shit: yes big time immediately go do that. Who knows what she will do to your toothbrush, your shampoo, your menstrual products, your clothes, your books, your blanket - ANYTHING.

153,"Your reaction is totally normal, appropriate and reasonable.


I think this IS repariable, but  the real question is, what do YOU want?  Do you want to fix this?  If so marriage counselling might work if he is willing to open up as to why he really did this and work on fixing it.  Ultimately you have lost some trust in him and he will need to work hard to build it back up."
154,"Dang, yo. He banned weekend emails AND found a way to prevent layoffs? I like this guy.

I'm sorry I don't have much more advice to offer. Regardless of Tina leaving or staying, at least you have a good boss in the mix."
155,"Lying neighbor aside, your wife is the type of person who falls for scams. Some people mistake confidence for reality. It probably makes the other woman feel good to have an audience."

157,"""I need you to replace the two slices of X Brand cheese you borrowed by tomorrow so I can eat lunch for the rest of the week. I usually plan my groceries carefully, so in the future, please ask before borrowing, so I'm not caught without a necessity. Thanks!"" If she comes back with the wrong thing, say ""Oops, this isn't the right kind. I can't use this. My kind is Y flavor of X Brand, just like the one you borrowed."""
158,Great advice! I wish I would have learned this sooner.
159,"So let me make sure I understand this: you’ve spent the better part of almost **six months** torqued because a chick you were casually seeing posted a photo of a dude she’d banged? And you’re allowing yourself to be upset just by any other image of this guy because he happens to be famous? 

This is 100% your problem and your hang up. She hasn’t spent the last six months comparing you to him, you’ve spent the last six months comparing yourself to him. There’s always going to be some other dude with a bigger dick, or more money, or better looking, more popular, famous, with a nicer car or a fluffier dog: if you can’t accept this chick likes you for who you are and what you bring into the relationship, that’s a you issue, not a her issue."
160,"You need to talk to your stepdad ASAP. He might be really distracted and upset because of your mom, but you need to sit him down and tell him you have something serious to say. Tell him “Stepdad, I’m horrified and confused about what Mom is doing. I get it that you need to break up and move out. But I’m terrified to lose you and not see you again. I care about you and I’m attached to you. Can we keep spending time together? [if applicable:] I was hoping I could move in with you.”

I’m really sorry about your mom. She likely suffers from an undiagnosed mental illness. What matters right now is not the specifics of what she’s done or why she’s doing it, but that she’s unstable and unreliable right now. 

Besides your stepdad, is there any other adult you can reach out to for help navigating this situation? This can be a friend’s parents, a religious leader, or a teacher or guidance counselor at school."
161,"&gt; she does it in public sometimes, too.

I would genuinely be weirded out by this. You can ask her to stop, but she could also tell you to stick your opinion where the sun don't shine. So be prepared for that."
162,"as a man, i prefer sex without condoms to sex with condoms, so, since there has never been a pressing need for my personal genetic contribution to preserve our species, i got a vasectomy.

it's pretty great and i while i used to have minimal little respect for men that dump birth control responsibility and burden on their partners, now i have less than none.

tell this guy to wrap it, snip it, or beat it."
163,"If you don't really have any connection to her and no feelings for her as a friend, then just ghost her. If it is her that's writing that stuff about you on that site, telling her off might just give her impetus to make up even more shit. Telling someone obsessive and creepy to stop usually doesn't do any good and often has the opposite effect."
164,This is... extremely obvious and I'm surprised OP doesn't get it without being told.
165,"This. It doesnt say how long he has been a part of your life but it sounds like he has been a positive influence.

There is no reason why your relationship with him has to end. I wish you luck."
166,"This made me laugh as you've described my family to a T here, my Dad's favourite dinner is ham, egg and chips which he somehow manages to find everywhere he goes and he once called my cooking exotic because I added prawns to my otherwise boring pasta dish. 

&gt;  so they won't be able to solely eat what little western food is available 

I'm gonna say that they will be fine, you would not believe how picky eaters manage to find their niche when abroad and usually that's all they will eat! My sister traveled Asia for 3 months and just ate baguettes the entire time. I honestly despair at these kind of people who have all this amazingly different and delicious foods on offer but stick to what they know, but that is their loss not yours!"
167,"The fact that you've reached the point of ""secretly boycotting"" his laundry indicates that communication and mutual support has really badly broken down in your relationship. It sounds like his ""doesn't work"" comment might be related to the laundry boycott, and it sounds like he might be secretly boycotting helping you in retaliation. 

Your relationship is in a serious downward spiral so try to get into that counselling ASAP."
168,"&gt;Unless it's a really, really boring novel, this just isn't true of ""all relationships"".

THIS. You know you're in for a doozy when the OP starts with rationalizing a toxic relationship with ""Oh, you know, like any normal couple we've had our ups and downs!"" and then they go on to describe the classic abuse/honeymoon cycle that they've tolerated for years."
169,"Along theses lines, do NOT block him on your phone or email! All those messages are evidence!

On your phone, set his ring tone to silent/no vibe and then let it go to voicemail every time. And save those voicemails! Back them up to your computer, to the cloud, and transcribe them for hard copies. The call log will support your claim of harassment as well. 

For emails, create a filter that sends him to a separate folder so you don’t even see him in your inbox. Make sure you also   Back them up periodically. 

Sorry you’re going through this, OP. You are handling it way better than I would have. You got this!!!"
170,"This is so perfectly put. just because something's been working for you in the past it doesn't mean it needs to work for you indefinitely. my boyfriend passed away before we were able to marry. The circumstances were very different, we were in our twenties and had only been dating for a couple of years. Still, it makes me infuriated that I have to refer to him as my boyfriend when really he was so much more than that. When he died, my name wasn't in the obituary. I felt like I didn't exist. So I totally get why you're feeling the way you're feeling. It's not silly and it is rooted in some truth. Have a conversation with your partner about what works for the two of you."
171,You just need help. I have no fucking idea how you’ve managed all this. Couldn’t agree more with the above
172,"What the fuck man. Your sister consistently disrespects your family, physically assaulted you all, and said she *wished your daughter would die*. You have to protect your wife and child, even at the expense of satellite family relationships. That is your job. Proof of psychiatric intervention would be the only thing that would make me even consider meeting up with her (and even then, you and only you to start)."
173,"Honestly OP? You act sort of like you’ve never seen them directly annoy or disrespect your spouse. “It sounds like something he would do” seems to be as close as you’ll get to actual acknowledgement. 

She told you your dad got *excessively angry* when alone with her and you sort of shrug like oh yeah sounds like dad. 

Do you think she feels advocated for? Protected? To me it sounds like you’re defaulting to the trap of “the most difficult person gets their way because that’s just who they are”. 

Your wife feels so unsupported by you that she’s taking herself out of the situation altogether. 

You say she’s seemed upset when nothing was happening. Really think. How much of their behavior to you is actually rude or disrespectful? You miss it. To you that’s who they are. So it’s very possible that they are pointedly rude to your wife and you don’t see it. 

My point is, you show a surprising lack of any sort of self awareness. You’re defaulting to “but they’re my parents so what can you do?” You waffle between understanding they are difficult, then minimize all of your wife’s experiences as “that sounds like them”. It IS them. And your wife has so far navigated it alone. 

So what do you do? I would tell your parents she is busy. I would ask if she is willing to do a dinner with them if you promise to stay aware and intervene when they get to be too much. Personal remarks? “Let’s move on” is all you need."
174,"Also, 100% ignore this woman and her comments. If the kid shows up again, just be your normal self. There's literally NOTHING you can say/do to help this situation right now. His parents likely feel guilty and defensive. You can't fix that for them."
175,"This is exactly what I am doing. Taking distance for myself. It’s easy to justify his behavior to myself, but when I read back over it, I see how crazy it is."
176,"Okay so no, you are not a ‘piece of shit’ for not empathising with your mum. Families are complicated and it doesn’t make you ‘shit’ for not being able to empathise with someone who has not shown you love.

However, it is still concerning that someone (whether you hate them or not) can display such extreme unwell behaviour and your own feelings towards them stop you from providing them immediate medical help. Your mum is clearly not in a state to ‘choose’ to get help so your offering for her to go to a doctor, but making her make the decision, isn’t going to help her - in fact, her inability to decide then validates your idea that it’s all ‘a manipulation’ and allows you to feel right in not getting her help. Honestly if she’s that out of her mind your first port of call should have been taking her to the hospital or doctor (or if you couldn’t as you say you had to work, asking your husband or someone else). No we don’t ‘owe’ people anything, especially people who have treated us badly, but she is displaying really severe signs of something wrong with her - she could have a brain tumour or a stroke if not a mental breakdown. It doesn’t make you a piece of shit but I think it’s concerning that your first reaction was to let her wander around and continue not even being able to speak properly, rather than immediately taking them to a medical centre.

I get feeling manipulated by fake behaviour - my cousin has BPD and is a severe alcoholic and I’ve literally seen it all. Suicide threats with no intent, refusing to speak, pretending to collapse/be comatose, pretending to hallucinate. The list goes on. It’s incredibly frustrating and you want to punish them for wasting your time/trying to manipulate you into feeling sorry for them. I also find it repulsive. But any severe shift in behaviour or physical symptoms like not being able to articulate, wandering around, being incoherent warrant an immediate trip to a doctor, ‘pretend’ or not.

You yourself say you didn’t get help for your own mental health issues until your husband gave the ultimatum of divorce. I can only assume that means up to that point you were not treating him well or yourself well. You have compassion and understanding for your own struggles so try and give it to someone else, even if they have hurt you before. The fact your mum is coming out of the bathroom with her pants around her ankles is REALLY concerning and I genuinely think you need to immediately take her to an emergency room for a scan. It is worrying how unconcerned and callous you are towards her, and it makes me think your therapy may not have been as successful as you think. I would revisit your own therapy to explore why you hold onto such hatred of your mother, and why it clouds your judgement of what seems to me like a pretty clear urgent medical issue.

It’s okay to say you don’t love her. It’s not okay, in my opinion, to watch her suffer through a medical emergency because you either a) don’t believe her or b) feel justified in it.

It’s also telling that you love your absent father and think he shows ‘kindness and patience’, when it sounds like he is as much to blame for your issues growing up as your mother. You say both parents were disappointed in you, both parents drilled in a certain set of ideals you could never live up to, both parents neglected you. So why is he glorified and your mother vilified? I’m sure your mother is an awful, abusive person. But you sound like you have ‘golden parented’ one and scapegoated the other, and again this indicates to me you need to go back into therapy to stabilise your view of them as people in reality. Your view of them at the moment seems to me unrealistic and exaggerated where one is great and the other is evil - the reality is probably far more complex, and I think learning to see that will help you immensely with the issues you’re clearly still carrying with you."
177,"I don't think it would be wrong to ask, but not demand it.

I would think it making you uncomfortable would be enough for her to do it, but that's just me.

If she refuses, I'd wonder why a guy she used to bone is more important than your feelings."
178,"Ummmm... there are so many red flags here. He cheated on you and he’s still lying to you about things even after that, which means he probably will cheat again or already has. Plus he doesn’t seem to value one-on-one time with you."
179,She just didn't want to share something private with people outside of the family.
180,"I would say it’s really up to you in this situation. If you’re not ok with it, then it’s not ok. I would say most people wouldn’t be ok with this, so your feelings are completely justified.

I am ok with it with my gf if she’s known the friend for years and I also know them well. I trust her completely tho and we’ve been together 9 years, so it may be situational. Depends on their relationship dynamic as well."
181,"Op, that’s not your problem. He’s a 26 year old man who isn’t taking responsibility for himself. His actions have consequences."
182,"People are often very good at compartementalizing things. It's entirely possible that his thought process is ""fat people are lazy slobs, except for 9zd3, she's got health reasons for putting on a bit of weight, and she looks beautiful anyway.""

In other words, what he writes on reddit doesn't necessarily say anything about how he sees you. 

But it does say something about him that he writes such unkind things about other women. I can't say I find that very attractive."
183,"&gt;A few hours later he sent me a message asking if I'd left him the present. I said I had, and he said that Lisa had just knocked on his door holding it and saying that she'd just picked it up because she thought he'd like it. I said I'd left a note with it (nothing too fancy, just a little comment and my name) and a few minutes later he replied saying it had been torn up and tossed in the kitchen bin. I know it's something little

Oh this is not little AT ALL

She is crazy, point blank. Your dude MUST take this up with whoever is actually in charge of residency placement and demand a move. Period."
184,"I truly don’t understand why you expect a fat sexist man to change when he has never shown any real interest in doing so.  It’s like you think you are dating a different person than you are.  This is who he is.  You can’t get married to someone’s potential.  Honestly your description of him triggers true disgust in me, I’m not sure how you deal with it,"
185,"Did you ask your parents together?  If so, talk to your dad alone and tell him the details of your research.   This girl was conceived during what would have been your father's early adulthood, or college days."
186,"You have done 100% the right thing. Not only is this man dangerous, so is your sister. She knowingly exposed your daugher to a nonce. She's not someone you need to keep around."
187,"This is it.

You're not in charge of resolving this problem and you're not obliged to pick up the tab so that her kids can have a relationship with yours.

Make it clear to your sister that the only way to mend this fence is to get help. That's literally the only thing you'll accept.

Don't let her gaslight you. She charged at your pregnant, disabled wife with an intent to assault her. She wished death upon your child. She's had episodes about this multiple times. And she's 35.

This isn't normal. This isn't healthy. Make her get some fucking help.

*Edit: apologies for the tone. I just see this a lot where families refuse a member gets help despite knowing there's obviously an issue."
188,"""And yet I chose to be selfish""

No. You're choosing to not take on the burden of their poor financial decisions. THEY are being selfish by wanting to shift the burden to you when they aren't even willing to downsize themselves. 

So let's say you buy their house. Do you live there? Do they live there? Would you be willing to evict and sell if they stopped their payments?"
189,Talk to her about her life plans since that seems to be the biggest concern
190,"Damn dude. First of all, I'm sorry you're going through this. This is absolutely a shitty situation. First of all, everyone outside of this situation- meaning everyone outside you and your fiancée can kick rocks. You're not obligated to answer any of them. Her friends were complicit anyways and are assholes for trying to lie about it.

Secondly, I imagine most people are going to tell you to break up with your fiancée and that very well may be the endgame to this. However, I would take a couple of days to cool down first. At the very least, put the wedding off indefinitely and get into counseling, both individual and couples. You and your fiancée need to have some long, hard talks, not only for her infidelity, but her lying to you about it. Once that happens, you can determine whether you can move past this at some point or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish you the best of luck."
191, You have every right to be upset. That’s shady as fuck.  Would he be okay if the situation was reversed?
192,"this is something I would do... but sometimes I just prefer calling a person out directly, like, the next time I encounter bullshit, I'd just tell her that this can't be true and to prove it to me, since I've never heard of such a thing.

but then he would have to make sure, that evil lying neighbor doesn't try to get between Erin and OP, cause if Erin has established this kind of trustful bond with lying neighbor, she might believe her, if she tells her, that OP is not a good husband and wants to be controlling... people like that can be very vicious when they realize that someone is onto them and tries to take away their ""designated victim"""
193,"He’s a violent person. He thinks that violence is an acceptable way to resolve situations. This is who he is, and if this is what he does in public (bar fights, beating a dog) god knows what he does in private. 

Remember, he hasn’t gotten mad at you ... yet."
194,"I think your break up instinct is spot on. This fellow sounds like a taker. Very happy to receive all your support and now he doesn’t need it anymore. The crown on this is his dissing all the support you did provide. Unless he communicated his needs and you ignored him, he sounds like a total selfish doooosh.  

You’re well rid of this guy."
195,"Call the credit card company, cancel the card. I would also consider freezing your credit, if you're worried your mom will do this again.

The thing about growing up, is your parents don't just suddenly see you as a 21 year-old adult daughter, you have to set the tone for that relationship. You do it by acting like an adult. A teenager whines and complains about their mom coming into their room and says snappy, mean things when they're upset (I'm not insinuating that's exactly what happened, but showing you what would be counterproductive.) Behaving this way sends clear signals to parents, ""I'm still a child, I still react like a child, and I need you to treat me like one."" But if you instead stay level-headed and calm, say ""I appreciate your concern and that you're just doing what you think is best for me, but I am not okay with you opening anything in my name. I am an adult and you do not have my permission. Feel free to share these opportunities with me, and I will come to you if I have any questions and will pursue ones I think are a good fit."" You can also set boundaries and hold firm to them, ""If you do this again, I will have to do xyz."" Make sure the consequences is fair and clear, and you mean to follow through if the line is crossed.

If you behave like an adult in situations like these, she will stop doing them so much, or hopefully at all.

I also think that moving out (whenever you can) will make a huge difference in how your parents treat you and will probably vastly improve your relationships with them."
196,Sweet Jesus. I can’t stop laughing. Yes. Tell her. Someone must tell her.
197,Why is a 14 year old hanging around an office building for 8 hours and why is she allowed to disrupt employees? Complain to management.
198,"Thanks so much for this! I talked to him earlier and he still 100% wants to still be in me and my siblings lives. 

I unfortunately really don’t have any one else at the moment but I’m trying to reach my biological father."
199,"It's not acceptable.  He hasn't listened to you before, why would the ""go-be-single"" thing suddenly be the first thing that he decides to start listening to you about :P  

If you meant anything to him, he wouldn't have cheated, regardless of whether you told him to or not."
200,all the internet stranger encouragement to you for staying strong.
201,"Your son is only 1 month old.  Your father is a sick man.

100% no.  Baby safety is more important than your father’s wishes.  Maybe set up a FaceTime call or something?"
202,"Yeah I've never quite understood this line. And technically, their ""last night of freedom"" happened years ago when they first started dating the person."
203,"This sounds a lot like my ex. He once legitimately told me, ""I work hard all day, and I want my time at home to be my relaxing time."" I stared at him and said, ""So when do the chores get done? If your time is only split between work-time and relaxing-time, does that mean it's *my* job to spend my non-work time cleaning up after you?"" He looked very uncomfortable at all this, and promised to be better. But his best still wasn't good enough.

Cue years of me asking him to take the rubbish out, reminding him to take the rubbish out, sending him a text from work to remember to take the rubbish out, and then coming home to find the bin overflowing (and he'd look up from his game and say, ""Whoops, I forgot. Can you please do it because you still have your shoes on?'). And this wasn't just for one chore, this was for all the chores. I'm sure he believed himself to be a responsible partner, but the truth was, why did he need to worry about putting stuff away when *someone* (some magical cleaning fairy, no doubt) would put it away sooner or later. And then, when I broke up with him, he couldn't believe I wasn't willing to give him a second chance. When I pointed out that his lack of willingness to pull his weight regarding chores, he said, ""I had no idea it was that important to you!"" As though three years of daily reminders had meant nothing to him...until I was ready to leave him over it. 

He begged me to stay. He promised that *now* he knew how much of a big deal it was, he'd do more around the house. But it was too late. Years of me asking and begging him to do more, and years of being ignored, had killed all passion and attraction I had for him. How could I feel sexually attracted to someone who behaved like a stubborn child? How could I feel passion for someone who didn't care how much his filth was distressing me?

When he realised I was serious, he threw at me, ""I would have stood by you through anything! You could have been crippled in an accident, and I would have done anything and everything for you!"" I through back, ""I *did* do everything for you. You couldn't even take a fucking bin out.""

&gt;  I don't know if it's an age thing that he'll grow out of

Do you know what makes filthy 20-somethings grow out of their filth wizard ways? Partners actually leaving them over it. That's when they realise, ""Oh, this is actually a big deal."" If you yell and cry and beg, but ultimately stick around and clean up after him anyway, what incentive does he have to change? 

Let him know that this is a make-or-break issue."
204,"I think you need to come to terms with the fact that your parents are likely really unpleasant for most people to be around (""gets really angry at strangers for dumb things"" sounds like a description of a person who is really awful to spend time with), and your focus should be dampening the impact their anger/defensiveness/unpleasantness has on *her*, not making sure she doesn't hurt their feelings when she gives them a wide berth."
205,"Venmo doesnt have to charge a service fee. She must want the money asap so they charger her an extra $1.50 to expedite the payment to her bank. If you actually let them process like normal, there is no fee."
206,"Exactly how I took it. OP notices when Erin “sides” with the crazy neighbor and we hear his side. OP sounds like he loves his wife and wants the best.

Erin sounds like she is craving friendship, and feels isolated. She’s 20, and alone in a new area. She probably doesn’t have the confidence to push back and doesn’t want to risk the friendship, and being alone again.

The new friend sounds awful, I hope Erin gets away from her and finds a community or a loving friend that supports her. I know how it feels to be someone raised in a small town, and then transplant somewhere new when you’re 20 and very sheltered. I wish them the best."
207,"I'd sit her down and say ""Tina, I know you are incredibly qualified for these jobs you are looking for. But bringing your mom to your interviews is killing your chances. You completely deserve the opportunity to get that stellar job! We all know you are capable. Do you have any particular reasons you bring your mom?""

And then take the conversation from there."
208,He came to the place you live in and deliberately chose not to see you. That shows exactly where you are on his priority list. He requires immediate dumping. Throw the whole man out.
209,"You should tell your English teacher.

It is not your responsibility to manage your art teacher's feelings. She is an adult with a job managing kids, and if she is making those kids uncomfortable (whether or not it is intentional!) she is doing a bad job and needs to be reported. 

Literally just show this post to your English teacher and have him intervene. Hopefully she just has poor boundaries, will learn from an administrative intervention, and will no longer make you or future students uncomfortable."
210,"I had a problem with it when I was a kid. It gets tied to a sense of ""comfort"". You'll have to find a way to make it unappealing (they make some really horrid tasting clear nail polish, but it on BOTH thumbs, I switched to my other one when my parents tried it), and also a new comforting habit to replace it."
211,"Nothing what you describe is little, and her behaviors will probably escalate. He needs to go over her head and speak to her supervisor before she gets retaliatory and sabotages his living situation."
212,"Yes, you need to report the plagiarism. You even contacted her privately and gave her a chance to make it right, and she still managed to shoot herself in the foot."
213,"So she always reacts this way when she's upset?

Because even if you're in the wrong this time, that doesn't mean you should stay with someone who acts like a baby when she's upset.

You can date a grown woman who ACTS like a grown woman, you know."
214,"So is he sweet or is he a “low key douche”?

These two traits don’t go together."
215,See that last sentence would have been really important to put in your OP.  That is completely detached from reality to tell people that someone that is dead is getting along fine.  That's way out there!!

I (20f) had a similar situation in which case I’d be like your son and my dad would always spoil my friends. I had a friend who’s mother was a meth addict and went to jail for a bit when we were 12 years old. My parents, knowing my friend was a great student and good kid, took her in. My mom worked a lot and my dad was retired. Their daughter stayed with us until the mom got out of prison and tried to take her back. She wanted to move to Florida but had no plan. Child services said my parents could watch over/act as my friend’s guardians and my parents loved having her around because she would help do dishes after dinner. 

The mom tried taking her daughter back and claimed my dad was “grooming” her and we made her do forced labor or some shit. Long story short, the mom ended up taking her back and called my dad a child molester that would cover it up by buying her daughter things. When her daughter spoke up against her, the mom said she was blinded by fake gifts. 

Moral of the story: Parents that can’t provide the basics for their kid will blame anyone but themselves and make up the craziest lies in the process. (Not all parents, but the ones in denial will.)"

What does your fiance suggest?"
229,"Based on this post and this post alone:

No.

Here's the longer version: your sister is not a safe person to be around, period, let alone be around your children (one of whom she wished death upon, lest you forget.)

Your wife is absolutely right in not wanting your sister in her life, or for your sister to be around your children.  She was physically assaulted by your sister while pregnant - how is that not enough?

Your sister's behavior is symptomatic of a serious mental illness.  Is she getting serious, professional help for it? If not, there is no reason to engage her, because the ""civility"" that you so want will not be there, or be there for long.  You will be endangering yourself, your wife and, it does not go without saying, your children (born and unborn.)

Also, she apologized, yes.  *Two years* after the fact.  What, did it take that long for it to sink in that maybe assaulting your brother's very pregnant wife wasn't a good way to behave? 

That apology means absolutely nothing.  For one thing, it doesn't change the fact that your sister needed and still needs help.  For two, abusive people can and in fact, do, apologize for their behavior.  It's a way for them to default to the ""clean slate"" ('cause then everything is ""okay"" again) so they can go on behaving like they do.

And, of course, caveat emptor: if just a simple apology is enough for you to consider whether or not your wife will let her children around your clearly dangerous sister, maybe you ought to re-evaluate how you see things.  Because with just a long-winded ""I am sorry"" you're considering which concessions could be made to allow your sister back in."
230,"You don't get it. It's not that he doesn't UNDERSTAND when you tell him to stop and that you don't like it. It's that he doesn't CARE. Or worse, he enjoys violating your boundaries like that. He's sexually assaulting you. Even if he's your husband, it's sexual assault. You married an abuser."
231,"If you aren't married and you don't have EU citizenship ""we"" will certainly not be moving.  This kind of mixed nationality thing is exactly why a lot of people I know tied the knot.  You actually can't just pick up and follow a bf to a different country that easily.  Nor is it advisable since you can be left in the lurch so easily."

if he approaches you, say ""i'm not discussing that with you"" and ""i've got to go"". be very boring about it. flee to the bathroom or someone's office or anywhere he can't follow you. 

possibly talk to a supervisor/PI/professor whatever you have as an authority. WHY do you think it would be an automatic expel? ""we used to date and he will not stop pestering me about who i'm seeing now. i don't want him kicked out but can someone please talk to him about his behaviour."""

236,"Frankly, I think you both acted properly.  

For you, considering that he gets violent and screams when angry, I think it was fair to breakup by text.  It lets him have his shrieking meltdown away from you, and he's calm by the time you show up to get your stuff.

For him, you broke up with him because of his violent outbursts, and you did it via text.  That's a pretty clear ""I am 100% done with your drama"" message, and he obliged you by giving you 0% drama when you came by.

242,"OP, do the other two flat mates know what’s going on? Can they back up BF when he reports Lisa?"
243,"Here’s what needs to be said 

“Lisa, you know I have a girlfriend and I’m very happy with her. I’m going to ask you once very nicely to stop calling me pet names and I think we should only speak to one another when absolutely necessary from here forward. You are making me and girlfriend very uncomfortable and I feel like it is an abuse of power as I am living here and you are the equivalent of an RA. If your strange and unwelcome behavior does not change immediately I will absolutely go over your head to have it settled officially. This is the only time I’m going to discuss this with you. From now on you have to stay within the boundaries I just laid out or I will be forced to seek outside help.”

I would file a complaint with whomever is over her BEFORE I had this discussion and I would put it in writing via text and email as well as a physical letter that your bf makes a copy of so there is proof that he did what he could to mitigate the situation before her behavior escalated further. 

I say file the complaint before that way when she tries to twist the facts which she will absolutely do, it’s already on record that her behavior is unwelcome and making him uncomfortable in his living environment."
244,"Yes I read somewhere that if they send 100 texts and then you respond to the 100th one, they you’re teaching them that all they have to do to get your attention is send you 100 messages and they will keep doing it. So do not respond at all! You’ve already told him to stop. You can go to the police now."
245,"Agreed, and it sounds like this was their plan for the night and not hers. From his description, she sounds mortified, and while she absolutely should have come clean about what happened in the first place, I think it could be worth having the discussion of dumping those friends if they decide to stay together. Especially if she can agree that these people are toxic influences and created this horrible situation.    
    
I'm not excusing drunk behavior by any means - I've had plenty of people in my life who have used that as their explanation for every stupid thing in the book. Dude, if you decide to try to with things out, ask her for her plan on how she's going to prevent these kinds of stupid things from happening again. If she keeps the garbage friends, maybe she cuts out the alcohol, though personally I'd choose just about anything over people like that if they put ME in a situation like that."
246,"This exactly. She's worried having kids is important enough to OP that he's going to leave her. She's scared because not only is she losing her future children that she wanted, she's also trying to prepare herself for the possible end of her marriage. Kids are a major thing, and it's not unheard of for relationships to break down over things like this."

You’re like a mental health super hero that you haven’t had symptoms in two years. Dude, if I had that level of self discipline and willpower I’d be a PhD with a super models body. I don’t think you realize how special the attributes in yourself are that got you to where you are today.

I had no idea how to handle it and my friends egged it on and of course we were all wasted.  It was a terrible experience, I wish I had shut it down immediately, and I learned a LOT from it.  Especially about some of my friends and how to have boundaries with them.  I'm concerned that these people who set this up and egged it on are supposed to be the 'good guys' now.

If you do that, they walk away free of no debt with no obligation to pay anything.

If I were you I’d cut them completely off for a long while as I don’t really take kindly to people trying to play me for a fool, but I’m a bit different when it comes to stuff like that. At very least you need to shut this conversation down quick and stop talking finances with them.

Your role in life is NOT to make someone else a better person, and he needs to do the work of keeping himself accountable. And the concept of PIV virginity as some magical thing is also kinda bullshit. Like experiencing a penis will be so special that you’ll literally be a different person? It sort of all feels like a control thing, not from your boyfriend specifically but it is for sure playing into centuries of misogyny, subtle and not. 

Your boyfriend has every right to abstain from sex if that’s his choice and it’s meaningful to him. But then he also has the responsibility to maintain that decision if he’s going to be upset when sex happens. Otherwise, maybe he needs to realize for himself that he shouldn’t be in a relationship bc it’s too difficult for him."

His sense of self and worth is all out of whack. It sounds like he is genuinely upset. And just like a toddler who is upset they can't have cake for breakfast, giving in isn't going to help the situation long term. He has a huge level of entitlement.

He and your family could really benefit from some LGBTQ affirming therapy. A gay therapist speaking with him and getting him know that he doesn't get or need a 20K party to prove he's gay, or that you love him, or that he's a member of the community. That one party like this won't make him famous long term or be the foundation of his insta-career.

I would 100% believe him when he says those things, so at least now you know you can't count on him for marriage or to be there for you. That being said, if it were me, I would absolutely not stay with someone that said those types of hurtful things to me.  They sound somewhat verbally abusive and it was HIS choice to help you through your illness, it's not like he had a legal obligation or someone was holding a gun to his head. You're still young, so I absolutely think you can still find someone that would be willing to marry you and would be proud of you like you said. I honestly would get out now before you spend another 6 years in a situation where you won't be happy."
276,"Dump him. He obviously doesn’t get how ignorant and hurtful crap like that is. It’s not your job to teach him. You’re young date someone else, lots of someone else’s and you will find someone that you don’t have to teach to be a decent person."

279,"Wow--that's a lot!

First, it sounds like a great thing overall that your Dad is back in your life. It's ok to tread gently in rebuilding your trust and emotions with him, but it sounds like that relationship is off to a good start.

Otherwise, a couple thoughts:

Are you at a University that offers student counseling services? I'd go hit them up right now (like first thing tomorrow morning, or today if they're open), just so that you have someone to talk this all through with. It may be that just after talking it out, you'll have a clearer idea of what you need.

Second, tell your close friends. None of the things that have happened reflect badly on you. You have made reasonable choices your whole life based on the information available. Don't be embarrassed to share what's happening in your life with people who know you and will be in your corner. 

On that front, I would strongly advise staying with a friend or other family member rather than your mom, at least for a week or two. You don't have to ask anyone to take you in for the whole summer, but if you can stay with someone who you trust and can talk to for a little bit, it'll help you sort your feelings out and plan from there."

*He couldn't say that.*  He said everything but.  Why?

Yes, yes you need to be worried.  Do you know how he feels about marriage in general?"
283,"Ok, so here's the thing, because you denied yourself a substantive romantic life for so long, even though you're 30 years old, you're going to have the dating experience and expectations of a 20 year old.  What that means is you haven't spent 10 years developing your character judgement, your knowledge of what's ""normal"", or have managed your own expectations in a boyfriend to the degree your peers have.  As anyone in their 30s and with long term partner will tell you, you have to sift a lot sand to find the gold.  

The guy you are preoccupied with is a good example of what I mean.  He sounds like a flaky weasel who is intimidated by educated, professional women.  You would be better moving from this guy because it's clear he is not quality boyfriend material (judge of character).  But instead you've taken his feedback seriously, even though you've done nothing wrong and he has, and are fretting about how ""intimidating"" you are (knowledge of ""normal"").  Now you're here asking for tips on how to change yourself to better suit the tastes of a type of man who is not worth your time (personal romantic expectations, namely an expectation that dating is somehow easy and a ""failure"" necessarily reflects on your own quality as a potential girlfriend).

You sound like someone with a lot of self-control, who likes feeling in control.  You're going to need to let that go to be successful in finding a good partner (finding *any* partner is easy, but why settle?).  Dating apps and even dating in general is chaotic, especially when you're at the early stages of doing many first dates.  It's also the best way to do it if you don't have romantic prospects at work or school.  You're going to have to prepare yourself to feel like you're wasting a lot of time on guys who aren't worth it, but even if you never see them again after one bad date, you are still learning a little more about how to better or more selective the next time.

And to answer your actual question, there is nothing about being a successful doctor with 2 sexual partners ever and no real boyfriend in your history that makes you somehow fundamentally undateable.  It puts you at a higher risk of being taken advantage of, certainly, but the kind of men you want to meet are absolutely out there."

You are under the mistaken impression that there is something you can do to change your ex’s behavior. There is not. So, as of this very minute, cease any and all efforts to “manage” him. When he tries to talk to you about your relationship, they’ll him, “Let’s just keep our conversation on a professional level.” Don’t make small talk with him. Don’t pretend to still be friends. Be a respectful colleague. When he’s speaking to others about his relationship woes, go willfully deaf."
286,"Marriage is a lot of things. One of them is a legal contract that protects people with combined finances. I would never combine my finances with someone without marrying them, even if we didn't want the social, religious, cultural part of a wedding and marriage. 

Because shit DOES happen, and it would be awful not to be with him if he was hurt, for example in the hospital, because you're ""not family."" This is why gay couples fought so hard for marriage. It provides securities that you can't get without the legal backing."
287,"DO NOT move in with this asshole. The reason your relationship got better is because you got distance. If that distance goes away, you will be right back where you were. This guy doesn't have ADHD, he has IDGAF. Someone who cares about you would have put a note on their phone to get you Cheetos, and wouldn't eat all yours when he comes over. I have ADHD, and I use a calendar and note apps to remind me to pick up groceries and what to get. I always make sue to ask my husband what he wants and I go out of my way to get it because I love him. See how that works?

If so, I’d imagine that what’s going on is that this news is a double edged sword for her. For one thing, she has to mourn the fact that the way she previously envisioned her future is no longer a possibility. Of course, there are plenty of other ways to potentially have a family, but she’s suffered a great loss now that she knows she will not be able to become pregnant and give birth to a biological child. The other side of this is that I imagine she feels in some way as though she has also let you down and is dealing with some intense feelings of insecurity and anxiety over the idea that her inadequacy might cause you to resent her or leave her or love her less. Of course that’s irrational, and I’m sure you’ve given her no reason to feel that way. I’m sure she even knows that it’s not a logical reaction. She’s just going through a hard time. She’s sad and afraid of the future of your lives together and your relationship. 

All you can really do is be there for her. Comfort her and reassure her. Perhaps consider having her (or both of you) talk to someone. It might help her process things. 

Good luck to you."

Maybe it my culture or where I live.

But if I live in a house, it's my house, if I rent or have bought it. A master bedroom doesnt dictate whether someone takes over the house or not?

Any room could be the master bedroom, if that is your preferred room. I understand the term master bedroom but that is all it is, a term to define the biggest bedroom in the house, not a legal binding area to then claim the house as yours."

299,"When I was about 17 I found out that I possibly won’t be able to have children. And it really fucked me up for a while, even though I was at an age where it wasn’t something I was thinking about. I still think about it a lot tbh, and the effect it may have on future relationships. It’s a difficult thing to come to terms with, especially with the way society pressures us into achieving the ideal “family”. 

If you intend to stay with her, and this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, please sit her down and tell her that. Reassure her. I agree with what someone said above, that she might be afraid you’ll leave her so is doing everything she can to please you. 

I just think this will take time. And lots of talking. Maybe therapy? But please don’t suggest it in a “you’re fucked up, sort it out” kinda way. More like “I can tell you’ve not been yourself these last few months, and I want to help but I’m not sure how, will you come speak to someone with me to help us both come to terms with this?” type of way. 

Tell her you love her, give her time, let her heal."
300,"Your boyfriend doesn’t have a place to live because he ruined the temporary arrangement with his sister. He did that, not you. He doesn’t have a driver’s license because he chose that, not you. He doesn’t have a job because he’s decided not to work- again, those are his decisions, not yours. Up until now, he’s coasted through life and landed on his feet.    Now rather than buck up and be a responsible adult, accepting the results of his own inaction and choices, he’s accusing you of giving up on him. You’ve got a child to raise: she’s 18 months, not 26 years old. 

What a you wanted and needed three years ago, as a 19 year old woman with no children, is different than what you need now, as a 22 year old woman with a child. Fun, spontaneous, carefree good times and hopping job to job are one thing when you’re just caring for yourself but once a baby in involved, it’s not just “two young adults having a good time” but a family.  Families have different needs and you’re smart to understand your daughter needs stability and routine. 

Speaking of routine, I hope to be wrong but I don’t think you’ll see your child’s father suddenly be a person he’s never shown you. He’s never been reliable and responsible, he’s never had a real plan followed by action. That’s how you ended up moving back to your home state with no jobs, no money saved, and prospects for housing that didn’t rely on the kindness of family. If he were what’s best for you and your daughter, he’d want you in the best situation for you both possible and would acknowledge and accept he isn’t it right now. He’d be busting his butt to make that happen. Instead, he’s throwing blame and guilt. Lift yourself above that, make your new life and accept the help your family is willing to offer."

If you do keep communication with your mother, keep that separate from your sister. DO NOT give your mother any information about your sisters life, where she lives, a phone number, absolutely nothing. If your mother asks for info on your sister, tell her nope and change the subject.

What she does with this moving forward is everything. The hire was a professional choice, not a personal one.

317,"I feel like all I can do is own up to it and say sorry, which I have done.


But she has a tendency to (in my opinion) overreact. If I break something around the house then she always treats it as if I have done it on purpose and gets so mad with me. The other morning she asked me to pass her new phone and as she went to take it from me it slipped from our hands. To me it felt like a pure accident, to her it was my fault for not holding it properly when I passed it, not being careful enough, and she didn't speak to me again all day (even though the only damage was the tiniest of scuffs on the very corner curve of the phone)."
318,"Untreated mental health issues are a dealbreaker for me. It will destroy the relationship. If your girlfriend is relying on you to keep her going, she's not being an equal partner to you. Your going to end up burnt out, co-dependent, constantly pushing yourself and your needs aside. Doing that for a brief time while someone's mental health stabilizes may be reasonable, but without pursuing treatment her mental health may never stabilize. Personally I'd tell her that you need a partner, and need her to sell mental health treatment so she can be that partner. If she can't or won't do that, she's not going to be healthy enough to be in a relationship with anyone."
319,"Please don’t reward him for this behaviour. 
It’s great (well, not really. It’s expected) that you were so supportive of him coming out, but i think your wife is right. He doesn’t get 20k just for being gay. He has support from you AS WELL as INCREDIBLY generous offers for his party that he refused. 

I admire your wisdom in thinking that you need to get to the bottom of his feelings, but don’t give in to his demands. He might be gay but you still run the household and pay the bills, and he needs to be grateful and show respect."
320,"&gt; I now feel like he neglected me for being overweight and now that I’m back at the same weight that I was when I met him, I’m all of a sudden worthy of his affection again.

Look, he obviously loves you deeply or he wouldn't have stayed with you despite struggling with his attraction. He wasn't deliberately neglecting you, it's just that you can't force yourself to be attracted to someone, especially when it comes to getting physically aroused. It has nothing to do with being worthy of affection. During this time, did you guys talk about the distance between you? He was probably feeling guilty and frustrated himself.

I think counseling would be a really good idea. You can both express your feelings surrounding this issue and it never hurts to strengthen your communication in general."

322,"Yeah, that's why I'm wary.

There is also no guarantee that they wouldn't use the proceeds to ""invest"" in something else. All that debt didn't happen for no reason, they probably took on bigger debts to cover their initial ones until it snowballed.

If I was going into this I was going to find ways to cancel their credit cards for good."
323,"No, absolutely not. Do not do this. 

&gt; I need to mention that the $300,000 debt came from being scammed and huge loans to bail out friends that later vanished. So, this didn't happen from irresponsible spending, just my parents misplacing their trust. 

I find this highly suspicious and I suspect you are probably getting a highly edited version of events that puts your parents in a good light. I suspect that its more likely that they've made a lot of bad choices - and that counts as irresponsible spending.

I'm pretty close with all my friends, and I'm also pretty adventurous (sex-parties and the like). There's no way in hell I'd just stand around at a (non sex-party) party with my top off, then watch whilst my friend gets fingered by a stranger, and *then* take photos of it all. 

And then share those photos over texts along with ""Yes, I agree, it WOULD be bad if your fiance found these.""

It's just such a weird situation, and doesn't actually sound like a fun time. Who wants to see their friend get on a bed and destroy their relationship weeks before the wedding?

330,"I'm going to repeat what you said, because I think OP needs to hear it.

Hey OP, I've got friends and family who have been through hard times. Bereavement, infidelity, unemployment, bankruptcy, abusive relationships; it's a very rare blessed person who hasn't had one of these low spots turn up somewhere in their life these days.

Want to know what their reactions have been? Drinking themselves into a stupor. Forgetting to shower. Eating too much or too little or the wrong stuff. Throwing themselves unhealthily into work...or ceasing turning up at all. The list goes on.

Want to know what none of them have done?

Had shrieking raging fits where they had to be physically restrained from hurting a disabled pregnant woman.

Wished death on an unborn baby.

Lost control of their temper to such an extent that their children and mother were scared of them and the police were called.

This. Is. Not. Normal. 

This is not a spat that apologies will be enough to get over. Your sister us in need of serious professional help, because otherwise, you have zero guarantee it won't happen again. When you have 2 kids...which means 2 targets.

Any apology you've been offered (I have my doubts as to how sincere the apology actually is if you show it to others; I suspect this is just the quality of apology you're used to getting out of your sister) that is not backed up by her getting professional help and making significant changes in her life should be disregarded entirely. Even if it's sincere, you do NOT immediately give her access to your kids; you do several months with contact with just you. If that goes ok, you include your wife. Only once both of you are happy and comfortable do you include the kids; if she puts a toe out of line during that, you nope the fuck out of there."
331,Yep. Straight talk. Pull the bandaid off.
332,"Yurp.

Got a guy in my own past who tells his buddies ""She dumped me because I got a tattoo.""

I dumped him because he lost (likely sold) his phone in the middle of a music festival we were at with friends, passed out drunk in some stranger's van, missed our flight home, had me panicking and talking to the cops, including them showing me some dead man's jacket after he'd been missing for 48 hours because they thought they found his sorry ass in a ditch, and when we found him, he didn't remember getting the very stupid and clearly now infected tattoo.

But sure man. I dumped you ""because you got a tattoo""."
333,Tell your boyfriend to set some fucking boundaries
334,I mean idk what to tell you here. You married a 23yo who already let you do most of the housework and now you’re surprised that she didn’t magically improve after you had a baby? This is why you don’t get married young (or to much younger people). She’s shown you who she is lots of times. I assume you’ve talked to her about this countless times too. Why do you still think this will ever change? How many more years and kids and commitments will it take for you to reach your limit?

339,"Here is the thing, and this can be difficult for first-ish homebuyers to accept.

Essentially ALL new build is ""shitty"". Unless you have a custom home built to very exact specs, it is ""shitty"" to these old fogies. They will look at manufactured/ lvl beams and scoff ""THEY DONT MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO!!"" when in reality engineering is leaps and bounds above what went on their day.

I say this as someone older than your husband who has owned many homes. ""Forever home"" is a very risky phrase. ""Forever home"" is translated to ""Nicest home I can barely afford in my budget""... Which is a VERY scary and risky thing to buy. 

Homes rarely depreciate (much). And if they do, so will the forever home you buy in 5 years. As long as you have a solid 20%+ down payment there is zero harm in what you guys are doing. It's new build, so selling in the next 10 years will be very easy.

That said, it's normal to have some weird buyer's remorse especially over a large purchase like a home."
340,"&gt; He said he wouldn't want to marry her and he will leave if she ""relapses again"". 

While I don't blame anyone for not being able to be with someone who is that ill (it's very rough and I personally don't think I could handle it), he kind of is saying that. I mean, I have a chronic illness. I take my meds. Much like OP, I go to yoga, I exercise to try to keep my strength up, I try to be super proactive and do everything I can to prevent a relapse or another flare up. It might still flare up again. It might get worse. I know it's different than a mental health condition, but if my husband said he would leave me if I relapsed, I would pack my shit and go. Because any kind of lifelong illness can always relapse. I don't want to be battling a chronic illness AND stressing that he's going to leave me if I get sick again.

If I were OP, I'd be headed for the door. He doesn't want to marry her, ever. That's fine. But she wants to get married some day and have kids. So they're not compatible. Plus, she should probably be with someone who thinks they're equipped to deal with a relapse. Not everyone is. Her boyfriend is not."

345,"Hi everyone, thank you for all of your comments and concerns! 

&amp;#x200B;

So I talked to him about this problem and I decided that we needed a break (i'll probably lead this into a break up later). His replies were incredibly immature (which is expected, imagine him as a stereotypical frat boy). Not really sure how to include text pictures but I'll copy and paste some of our texts down here:

&amp;#x200B;

me: let's take a break

him: What!!!!!!

Babe rly?!?!?!

R u serious???

Bc of 1 racist joke??

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

me: you know i don’t tolerate racist jokes

him: Babe i has no idea

I’m rly sorry

me: no

him: What

Since when???

I told those jokes before

And I’ll stop

&amp;#x200B;

and our last few texts:

**him:** Ok one last thing

Is the racist joke the only reason y u want to take a break?

Or is there something else

**me**: i don’t think you get how much racism means to me

maybe you think i’m overreacting but that’s just a really big no no and red flag for me

&amp;#x200B;

and a month ago, he accused me of cheating. B)"
346,"What I think is being missed in the discussion here is the fact that this sort of behavior from women with a stripper tends to be more about silliness than sexuality. 

All the women taking their tops off in the pictures isn't about them hooking up with a stripper, it's about them being silly and transgressive. 

So, look, you can define cheating however you want to define cheating, and I'm not saying the behavior she did is okay, but there's a long, long way from a bunch of girls taking their top off with a stripper and him doing some pantomimed sexuality (which is almost certainly what you're seeing in the pictures) and actually hooking up with someone. 

The only thing that *doesn't* sound like that is if he fingered her, but it's easy to imagine that's something where he crossed her boundaries and she laughed it off because that's what most people do in that sort of situation. And, of course, we don't even know if he did that, or if he did it that he did it with her consent or if she was instantly like ""whoa, dude, what the fuck?"" or if she was functionally blackout drunk at that point. And regardless, it's incredibly unlikely (despite what you might see in porn) that she was like, ""Yeah, get me off here in front of my friends, please.""

(A lot of people will say that, ""if he crossed a line, she should have shut it down,"" but in practice there is *tremendous* pressure to not harsh everyone's good time, and so a lot of women, in those situations, laugh it off.)

This sub has a tendency to round every boundary crossing up to the same thing as running a train in an alley behind a bar. You can see that in a ton of the comments. 

So when her friends are calling you an asshole, it's because you're treating something that they saw as a bunch of girls having silly fun that maybe went a little too far and treating it like she had an affair. 

Marry who you want to marry. Have the deal breakers you want to have. But if/when you decide to talk to her and/or her friends and/or her dad, recognize that part of the reason you can't imagine her doing this is probably because what you imagine her doing when you look at the pictures is very, very different from her experience of what she was doing when the pictures were taken. 

Good luck. This situation sucks."

So, it's nothing more than an avoidance tactic and an attempt to make OP feel guilty. Does he think he needs to sit around thinking about his mom's ankle, like that will do anything?"
358,If the roommate really doesn’t care about the pup then I wouldn’t even offer money. (I would never give up my dog for any amount of money).If I were you I’d just ask if she cares for the dog and if not can you take it? If she asks for money then go from there.
359,"The lesson is make your life worth remembering.  

I had a great uncle (died when I was little) that was similar (apparently). Couldn't get my grandma to say much of anything about him. And she always loved to talk about whatever.  Like he'd never existed. My dad only had a small bit of info, just enough to tell me he was despised universally."
360,How did your sister come to blame your wife and not see the both of you as a united front on this issue even though you disagreed? How is it that unkind things got back to your wife and you did not address this with your sister? What kind of situation are you in that you would be seeing your sis frequently enough otherwise that you are really sad at her absence?
361,"I think you be honest: “I know how much you both want a family. I want to make sure you have the information you need to make the best choices for your life....” then go on to explain who has the diagnosis. End this with a statement about wanting to support them in whatever they choose and you are giving them this information so they can make an informed choice. They may go ahead with having their own children, regardless."
362,"I hate to say it, but unless Tina cuts the umbilical cord, she's going to be stuck at home with no job, no life and nothing to look forward to for the rest of her life. It seems like her mother is perfectly fine with that, but if Tina really wants to start a career, she's going to have to grow a spine and tell her mother to stop being a helicopter parent and let her start her own life, on her own."
363,"You NEED to continue saying ""No"". Your parents are absolutely terrible with money.  Terrible.

If they weren't terrible with money, they would be able to get a business loan for 5k or a personal loan from the bank (in their own names), or even put it on their credit cards, if it's such a sure thing.  But, as you mentioned, no bank will touch them.  And they already owe other people money they haven't repaid.
.
And they refuse to give you information about this ""investment"".  That's another red flag. I suspect that the investment doesn't really exist or is something hinky (MLM?).

Never, ever lend your parents money.  Especially never go into debt to lend them money.  And don't get involved financially with them (don't invest in their business, let them put anything in your name, etc..).  if it involves money and your parents, say no.

You owe your parents nothing.  They chose to help you through school.  Perhaps you might be in a position to help them a bit when they are old and feeble.  But you don't need to wreck your finances because your parents paid a few school bills."

369,"I'm on the same boat and it took me too many years to realize I can't make her see life any other way than how she sees it. I'm still struggling with how acceptable it is to keep my distance, but at least I came to a point where I don't feel responsible for how she feels or for the decisions she makes about her own life.

371,"I get the sense that you are pushing yourself so hard from all the replies you’ve posted here. 

Could you perhaps stop and consider if you are being too hard on yourself? 

Why do you have to stretch and stretch and force yourself in order for someone else to accept you? 

Because I don’t think you need to. I think if you spent this energy on YOU and feeling like you’re enough for YOU, instead of spending it on making her feel like you’re enough, you would get so much more out of your life. 

Think about it. Is someone else worth this amount of strain? Why not give it to yourself first?"
372,"I can see it already. People like ""what happened, man?"" and he'll say ""she dumped me over cheetos."""
373,I think you're making this into an ongoing ordeal by periodically checking in with him about how he feels with having only one child. Your feelings haven't changed and he has told you he's fine with that. There's no need to feel insecure because it was a decision you made together. There's going to be times he may wonder how your lives would be with more children in the mix and that's perfectly normal. Just because he was openly musing doesn't mean he has regrets or that he doesn't support your *joint* decision to not have more children. If he starts having difficult feelings about this then he has a responsibility in the relationship to address this proactively without you feeling like you need to head it off.
374,Support your male roommate and tell the girl to hit rocks. She is disrespectful and has no common sense.
375,"People can change, but breaking up with her clearly hurt her. You’ve destroyed the trust she had in you. Even though you miss her, you shouldn’t ask for her back. Because you still care, you should let her heal and give her the opportunity to find someone she can trust. It sucks that you’ve made a mistake, but you shouldn’t just think of yourself. You don’t even know that she’s the one so begging for her back only to end it later again will make the situation worse."
376,"You could be in a whole different level of trouble once you turn 18. I wouldn't let yourself be alone with her. Don't exchange phone numbers and try not to engage beyond one word answers. 

From a professional standpoint, you should be working and if she's following you around and chatting then it's affecting your job functions. I'd mention it to your supervisor every time she ends up distracting you so that you start to have some sort of trail of proof."
377,"Your daughter comes first, for you and for him. You're doing the right thing getting her into a stable situation. There's no reason you can't see your boyfriend and spend time with him until you can both get back on your feet and get a stable place of your own.

You kind of glossed over something: you said he's never been able to show you he's capable of providing for you and your daughter in three years. Does this mean he's never had a job and you've supported the three of you this entire time? If that's the case, then he really needs to get his act together on his own instead of insisting you and your child be bounced around from situation to situation without any stability. That's completely unfair. His saying you don't love him for insisting on stability is him trying to manipulate you into doing something that isn't right for your kid. 

Stay with your dad. Be strong for your child. If he can't understand that or take steps to correct it, you are better off without him."
378,"&gt; Suggesting Plan B as an alternative to condoms is really messed up, especially since you cannot use hormonal birth control for health reasons. 

This stuck out to me as well. If hormonal birth control is risky for OP I'd have to think Plan B is extra dangerous? Either he's oblivious to the reality of her health concerns, or just doesn't care."
379,"&gt;every time I go on youtube I'm bound to see him pop up somewhere and it just reminds me of the whole incident, and how much it hurts me.

380,"What happened to convince your wife that your sister was too unstable?  What did she fear would happen if your sister moved in?  For example, personally with civil forfeiture and law enforcement being the way it is, in my part of the country at least, I wouldn't risk having someone who was using illegal drugs in my house.  It wouldn't be worth the risk, especially if there were no concrete steps already being taken to solve the issues and it was just a ""move her in and hope it helps""."
381,"Guy here.

I can't say they're right or wrong, but the reasons they gave are complete BS. A lot of guys like makeup, a lot don't. A lot of guys like skirts, a lot prefer pants. A lot like 'girly' girls, a lot don't.

Just based on what little I can tell of their personality (and yours) from the post, you sound more 'dateable' than they do."
382,"So you I threw your wife under the bus, your sister then (naturally) blamed your wife. Your sister hasn’t apologized for her behavior, and doesn’t even think she was wrong. 

Your wife doesn’t expect you to avoid your sister but is not willing to have your sister in her home. Your sister, who has never and will not apologize. 

This thread is nuts. I disagree with basically every comment. You were in the wrong for not backing up your wife, and are still in the wrong for continuing to not back her up. And from your sister’s continued lack of remorse, your wife was correct in not wanting her in the house in the first place. You should support your wife, and your sister should both apologize and genuinely recognize the issues in her own behavior before you have her in you and your wife’s home. Jesus."

You can look very well dressed with shirts for $50 or less. The secret is to getting them washed and pressed. Even a $250 shirt is going to look like crap if it's wrinkled.

Comparing yourself to others on social media is not smart."
384,"Kenny is 17 years old, like your son right? He's almost an adult now. And seeing how his parents deal with difficult situations (not well), very soon he is going to be all on his own. Should you have stepped in as a surrogate family? Who cares, that's in the past. You ARE his second family now, whether his bio family likes it or not.

&gt;He is not allowed over to our house anymore

Okay, but can he meet your son at a neutral location outside the house? Or is he being held at home against his will? 

When Kenny turns 18 and/or finishes high school, he can leave his home, if he wants. Have you considered offering him to move in with you? What would your son think about that? 

&gt;Both of his parents are chronically unemployed, and there is a history of domestic violence between the parents. The mother appears to have an untreated mental illness, and the father has a history of legal issues and arrests. Obviously, Kenny is very poor and his parents cannot afford to provide much for him. Kenny's mom will talk about all of the things she plans to do for him, but then doesn't follow through for whatever reason.   
&gt;  
&gt;his mother was pissed. She accused me of trying to seduce her son.   
&gt;  
&gt;He is not allowed over to our house anymore because his mom thinks I'm Michael Jackson and my house is Neverland Ranch.

Kenny is not surrounded by good people right now. His mom has untreated mental illnesses and he is bearing the brunt of it. He's almost 18 and yet he isn't allowed to choose where he goes or who he is friends with? He doesn't own a pair of sneakers? Used sneakers at a thrift store can be under $10... this is starting to sound a lot like neglect and possibly even emotional abuse (isolating him from his friends, his mom never following through on birthday plans, etc). Maybe even physical abuse if there was domestic violence at home?  

My advice to you is to see if your son can talk to Kenny about a game plan for what to do when he's ready to move out. The most important thing is that Kenny has a chance at a good life, and so your son should try to help him with that. You can help too, although if you are worried about Kenny's home life it's best if you ""appear"" uninvolved for now."
385,"Okay, sure, but why is your wife **constantly** taking this woman's word over yours? Especially with the car, a matter she should *know* you know a lot about, plus her not discussing a matter of money with you beforehand."

388,"Stop lying to the therapist and tell them what's going on. Your dad isn't supposed to be there for a reason.

389,"Your post has me confused.

I would say the fact that she was caught in an obvious lie (coffee/lunch) indicates unhealthy issues BUT I have no idea why. 

You're very mysterious. A mysterious fight that was her misunderstanding. Mysterious things she took years to tell you but told him. Idk. I just get a weird vibe from your post. 

She shouldn't lie to you. Lunches don't seem at issue but telling him private stuff maybe is depending on what it actually is. You should definitely talk to her about how you feel to better assess the situation. But I just don't get the way you wrote it because it feels like information is missing."

397,"Just bite the bullet and message her. 

“Hey [Friend], 

First of all, I can’t tell you how sorry I am for disappearing on you and dodging your messages. I’d like to set things right by paying back what I owe you, with interest, and apologizing sincerely for leaving you hanging. I’m extremely ashamed of it and I have no excuse. Please let me know how you’d like to receive the money and I’ll get it to you immediately.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to have a conversation with you about what happened. I’ll be glad to answer any questions you have for me. Please know that it had nothing to do with you or anything you did. I’d welcome the chance to catch up with you and hear about what you’ve been up to. I hope you’re well, and I look forward to hearing from you so we can settle my debt. All the best.” 

Don’t trip over yourself trying to explain unless she asks for it - leading with “I was depressed” or “I was broke” is going to sound like excuse-making. Stick to apologizing, offering the money, and opening the door to a conversation if she’s interested. The rest is up to her."
398,I (26m) am a husband with both depression and ADHD. I'm just going to throw in my two cents here and say that none of this really sounds like the effects of ADHD or depression. Depression doesn't make you see the grass on the other side as greener. It makes you see ALL the grass as dead. Lol I'm not gonna say what I think is going on here since I'm not an expert but I'd hate for you to spend time barking up the wrong tree so I just wanted to say I really don't think the ADHD or depression is the cause of all of this. I would think it's more marital issues. Maybe not that anything is wrong but things are just getting mundane in and out of the bedroom. It sounds to me like you're relationship is just in a rut and the 3 way was just the right amount of excitement and newness he needed to realize what a rut you two are in. Just get out of the rut. :)
399,"&gt; The most concerning part is that he is letting himself resent you because resentment is a harbinger of doom for realtionships.
&gt; 
&gt; The two of you need to talk and get to the bottom of things and talk about blaming. It's ok to have regrets, it's not ok for him to blame you for a decision you made together

Yep, this is classic case of husband blames wife for something she didn't do.  He's frustrated about his own decision to buy the house and needs somebody to blame, easiest solution is blame the wife.

I knew a guy who bought himself a super expensive truck with all the new features.  He would brag about it so much when he got it, he called it his ""baby"" and joked that he loved it more than his kids.  Well turns out he couldn't afford it and he had to sell it after a few months, and after he that he would always say that his wife made him buy it, that she's horrible at buying a car.  He totally blamed her for the purchase of ""his baby"" after he found out he had to sell it.

Sounds similar to OP's husband."
400,"Well, our friends don't know the person they just know of them since my gf used to talk about them (they live in another city). She didn't want to talk about it with anyone outside of family and so told me not to tell any friends that they had died..."
401,I've noticed that sometimes the new wives start feeling weird when they realize what a giant piece of shit their new husband is towards his own kids and push him to try to mend fences. The husband really doesn't want to so he sabotages every way possible while trying to make it look like he tried.

You (as well as her) created this ""problem"", not her cam girling

407,"I'm a woman and my boyfriend and I do not use condoms (I have an IUD). However, he was very clear from the beginning that this was 100% my choice as the person who could get pregnant and if I had said I wanted to use condoms, that's what we'd be doing and I would not hear a peep about it from him. The ultimatum isn't even the main issue for me here, it's him repeatedly being pushy about this even after you explicitly said no. That is so gross. Yes, sex feels better without a condom. You know what feels REALLY awesome? A partner who respects when you say no."

409,"So from one child of a crazy dysfunctional family with criminal and enabler elements to another:

You’ve gotta learn to prune the family tree. You have a kid now and you’re responsible for everything that kid is exposed to. The way you raise him will define his normal. Do you want him to think stealing from family members and drug running and all the other crazy shit that goes down in families like ours is normal? You want him to recreate this in his own adult life? If you keep them around then the odds of him doing exactly that increase exponentially. 

It’s hard because they’re your family. You have good memories along with the shit memories and you’re programmed to seek their acceptance. But they’re not healthy. They’re hurting each other. They’re hurting you. They will hurt your son. Do what you’ve gotta do."

414,Saying “no one else would have stayed with you” isn’t love. It’s cruel and it’s intentionally making her think that she’ll never be good enough for any one to love.
415,You guys are also ignoring the “I don’t even know why I help you” part. It’s not just that he doesn’t want to stick around if/when she gets sick again. He’s saying he doesn’t even know why he’s sticking around to begin with. It sucks but this guy does not see a future with OP and seems to resent his present situation as well.
416,"while i understand it's a difficult and emotional situation, i think she's overreacting. when you said details, i thought you were talking about the manner of death or cause of death or something (murder, suicide, genetic disease your GF may be at risk of...stuff like that). this person you spoke with thought the relative was still alive when they died months ago according to you. what else were you supposed to say? obituaries are public, the friend would have found out anyway, eventually, then you'd both have lied to her face about just the FACT of the death, and that's really strange.  

the flowers are sweet. tell her that you are sorry, that it just slipped out unintentionally. it's not like you set out to ruin her trust, it was an honest mistake. 

if she's worried about her friend being mad your GF lied to her, then your GF can sit down and explain that she was too distraught about the death to discuss it so she hadn't been disclosing the death yet and didn't intend to hurt any feelings in trying to protect her own.

also, if months later, your GF can't even speak about the death of a relative, no matter how close they were, she may need some grief counseling to help her accept the situation."

Learning a language is hard. It makes you feel stupid. I expect he dislikes feeling that power imbalance, and has been good at what he does and isn't accustomed to having to work hard at something from a beginning level. 

I would take it to be a sign of insecurity and immaturity that would be really unattractive."
421,"I second this. I doubt you’re the only 20-something woman who will take up this hobby and he will very likely try to do the same to them as be’a done to OP.

422,"So, you dated a 19 year old when you where 29, and ten years later are shocked that they didn't turn into the adult you wanted? Okay...

As the current issue: Has she spoken with her doctor?

I mean, maybe she is and has always been a shitty partner. Or, maybe she's experiencing the kind of issues that a whole shitton of women experience after their body gets flooded by mind-altering hormones for months and then ripped apart by a 7-10 lb leach on it's way out.  I mean, the child is literally dependent on her body right, but she's gone back to work and her body isn't performing the way she wants it to. I honestly can't imagine a bigger personal hell...

Also,

&gt; I tried voicing my frustrations a few weeks ago when she was mad at me for something,  

If you have an issue, bring it up. Don't sit on it until your partner is angry with you and then bring it up. That will almost always lead to a fight. 

If you are having difficult speaking up for yourself, go speak to a therapist and learn some skills to advocate for yourself in ways that are productive and respectful."
423,"Among other things, your husband may be unconsciously afraid to have sex and accidentally end up with a third kid. 

For now, change what you have the power to change. See a therapist for your stress, depression and eating disorder. Get some respite care so you’re not a slave to the kids/house 24/7. Find a couples counselor. Go away for a long weekend without the kids. The dead bedroom is a symptom of a bigger set of problems that need to be addressed."
424,"Tim needs to stop entertaining Lisa’s psychosis. He should not hang out with her. He should keep speaking to her at a bare minimum. He should get a lock for his door and make sure all devices and valuables are super locked down. I might even suggest a security camera for his room. He needs to protect himself, establish clear boundaries, and survive until he can move out.

If he’s not willing to stop being friendly with her after this psycho event you should break up."
425,"I just want to say there are some really disgusting comments in this thread. Some are suggesting putting hot sauce/bittering agents on his girlfriend's thumb **while she's asleep** without her consent. Others are hardcore shaming. One person even referred to viewing OP's girlfriend as intellectually disabled.

These comments are not helpful. They are not cute. People have a variety of coping mechanisms and none of us know why she uses thumb sucking to self soothe."
426,"Yea, I'm actually reading this and wondering if OP is crazy.  She thinks he's gay because her husband defended her 18 y/o cousin from family gossip?  That's an insane leap, but also shame on them for gossiping about the lad in the first place."
427,"Let your friends help you. At least you know THEY love you and want what's best for you and the baby.

And don't think for one second that your son's life will be stable if you stay with a cheater who is also starting to become abusive. On behalf of every kid whose parents were miserable together but stayed ""for the kids"" you can fuck that thought process sky-high."
428,"&gt;I always kind of thought eventually he would start to take some responsibility for his healthy and make at least some modest changes on is own.

As any regular here can attest, that's a common backstory to the ""My partner and I don't get along at all, what do we do?"" posts.  Marrying someone, or agreeing to marry someone, hoping that they will change, is a terrible idea.

&gt;**He is a very traditional guy and expects me as the woman to deal with food prep**-- to the point that he will literally not order delivery by himself. I will be working 12 hour days training on my feet the entire time and squeezing my own workout in, and he will be at his computer nonstop and only eat chocolate all day because I was not physically there to order him food or pick it up for him.

Classy.  Are you expecting this to change, too?

Don't marry someone because of who you wish they were.  Marry someone because of who they _are_."
429,"&gt;Your boyfriend is getting hella narcissistic. 

No kidding. Wow, he's been training a whole YEAR and he's God's gift. 

OP, I've been training 20 years. A lot of gym newbies get egotistical and evangelical, but this guy takes the cake.

I'm not going to say dump him but if you're going to stay in this, you have to demand respect. At best, I'd say that he needs to be knocked down a few pegs because he's making a fool of himself. This is exactly the kind of guy that ends up crawling back because his head was in the clouds and the reality is that he's just insecure.

Honestly I would never recommend any young person stay in a relationship where they're treated like this. I know you're probably looking for a different solution so standing your ground and standing up to him is the next option I'd recommend."
430,"Don't stay friends with him.

No more cuddling. No more contact. No more favors, especially. Don't pick him up. Don't go to his friends house. Don't hang out on his bed. Don't text him checking up on him.

He's leading you on. He says he doesn't want to give you the wrong idea, but kisses you and lets you come over. He says he loves you. None of this is fair. It's really cruel to do to you.

The great news is you are only 21. You have plenty of time to divorce him and move on. I know it's devastating. I know he betrayed you by lying (I assume he didn't just now realize). I know it sucks. What's worse is that he is letting you have contact when he wants it... that isn't fair. None of this is fair.

Stop letting him use you. Get the divorce started. Block his number for a while if you have to. You can always unblock him to inform him of divorce proceedings. What you need to do is harden yourself right now. Maybe start seeing a therapist to work it all out in your head? Deal with your emotions in time slots. You will go get the divorce started. And you will face it head on. And then when you get home you can mourn and cry. But you will still do what you have to do, no matter how much pain it causes you. You will do it because you have to. 

You're going to be okay. Eventually you will move on, and you will find someone who isn't such a huge gigantic asshole who uses you and then claims to love you after. And you will become familiar with them. You will have inside jokes. Their touch will be comforting. You will be able to open up to them. To laugh with them. To feel close with them. I know right now that feels like a huge massive insurmountable hurdle. I've been there. But it will happen in small increments. Until you feel you have a life again. And your self-worth rises. You'll be okay."
431,"From his timeline, they started dating exclusively when she was only 19 (and he was 29, ick). Sounds like he just assumed fatherhood responsibility from her real dad from the beginning, and now that's she's not a hot, pliable teenager his patience is wearing thin."
432,"He is a piece of human filth and you should divorce him. Sorry for being so harsh, but that's the truth.

I am vehemently pro-choice. That means CHOICE. He is just as evil as a man who tried to shut you in your bedroom and forced you to carry against your will.

He has shown you what kind of man he really is. Reach out to your family and divorce him."
433,"Yes, that was the therapist's professional way of saying ""you can't be productive in couple's counseling if you're lying to your therapist, your husband, and yourself."""
434,I should be clear: We don't demand a divorce as much as we told my sister she has to choose between being with him or seeing us and our daughter.
435,"Who cares if his friends hate you! If you don't want to date a drug user you dont have to and fuck people for trying to make you feel bad about it. 9 times out of 10 if you don't do drugs at all and dont like that lifestyle why would you want to be with someone that is? Ive been a drug user before and sometimes still now but any of the people that backed off from me because of it I still respect their decision because its their choice to make.
If your ex boyfriend is serious about getting clean thats great but he will need support but not just from you he will need an addictions counselor he will need to realize that certrain people places or things will trigger him and he will need to learn to deal with that.
Don't feel bad about your decision drugs and the drug scene aren't for everyone and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!!!

And those friends of his, if he seriously does get clean... he will see just how good of ""friends"" they are when they either stick around and support his choice in stopping using or just disappear and honestly good riddance"
436,She’s a 23 year old married to someone 10 years older. Is his behavior and her deference really a shock to anyone here?
437,"If he is unwilling to get rid of these useless items, and becomes inflamed or defensive when at even talking about it with you, he might be at the stage where he is beyond a 'packrat' and closer to having a deeper hoarding issue. Hoarding is related to OCD and it's quite tricky. (my mother is a bit of a hoarder)

I think that unless you are willing to put your foot down, you and your children will end up living in his museum of useless stuff and trying to keep your things in the nooks and crannies. 

Putting your foot down is also a risk, because if he's unwilling to see a therapist and unwilling to make room for you in his life, (since you jeopardize his collection), then he may go so far as to end things with you rather than face his issues head on. 

I hope I'm wrong about this. I definitely recommend you looking into hoarding and OCD so you can familiarize yourself with how to cope with it."
438,Seriously. What the hell did he even contact her for?
439,"By telling your sister your hands were tied you threw your wife under the blame bus. You dissolved your united front with her and let her take all the blame.


It's not your wife's job to fix your sister, and not wanting a 'sex and drugs' drama that your parents couldn't even handle in her home is completely reasonable. 

Then you let your wife twist on her own, and throw up your hands saying you don't know how you could have prevented it? Seriously? How about stand up for your wife and home?

Now your sister blames your wife for her ensuing issues, which are all of her own damn making, and talks shit about her that gets back to her. And you're upset that your sister isn't allowed at your home? Why should she be a guest in you and your wife's home when she doesn't respect your wife? 

It's not like your wife is banning you from seeing her ever, as you say you can see her elsewhere. 

Holy crap, dude. Your wife deserves to feel comfortable in her own home, and deserves a husband who supports her. You're being a spineless, whiny jerk who acts like she is too mean to your shit-talking immature sister. Just wow man."
440,"Honestly, if you hadnt found out she probably would've ended up meeting him. There is no excuse for her behavior and the way she reacted to being caught really says a lot about her character."
441,"I might be in the minority here but that seems like an enormous red flag to me. If you're that successful at 26 (props to you, man) and she still demands more out of you.... What's she gonna expect at 30? 35? I guess you'll need to be Elon Musk by 40 in order to keep her happy."
442,"Right?? The only ""fight"" my husband and I have ever had is because each of our approaches to hanging picture frames enrages the other. We each fumed silently until I left the room to cool off and zero hateful words were said. It is not normal to fight with your spouse all the time."
443,OP seems homophobic to me. She was embarrassed that he defended the cousin who was getting questioned. I'm straight as an arrow and would've done the same thing. Her list of why she thinks he is is super suspicions for being homophobic. My friends and I make jokes like this all the time and my wife of 10 years just laughs at them too.
444,"Because the concern is that one of the partners has now threatened and convinced the other to lie to the police to get them from being arrested.  Police leave, and then partner beats the shit out of them for calling the cops in the first place."
445,"So it would be an accumulation of a lot of different issues, literally all of which are his fault and not yours?"
446,"Very good for finally telling him off! You sound like the perfect girlfriend in supporting him through all of this this. He however, has his head stuck up his own ass.

See what he did when you finally told him off? He made it immediately being about him! It's not about him, it's about how you feel you're being treated and he completely ignored that. Tell him what you told us. Tell him you are proud of what he accomplished, but that you are also satisfied and proud of who you are, including how you look and eat. You have no interest at all to gain any muscle, to exercise more or to change your diet. Yet again, you are very proud of what he has accomplished but don't make him change you in something you don't want to become.

I hope he just needs a wake up call. He probably thought he was just stimulating you to become 'better' as well so he needs a reality check that he's pushing the wrong things onto you. One thing though, keep referencing to yourself and don't refer to gym girls het should date otherwise."
447,"How does a guy get to 28 without learning that women poop? Regular poops, not rainbow unicorn fluff."
448,That’s the issue about living with parents and or venting to them about your relationship. They feel like they need to put their input and they don’t. You and your husband knows what is going and that’s what matters. You should look into getting a home or two so if u can have a home nearby important locations.
449,"Quit smoking. Good for health, kids and your wallet.

450,Abusive relationships are confusing and full of really good good times and really bad times. There is a reason why abusive people still have people sticking around to get abused. They offer something that keeps the abused person with them.
451,"I had a friend go through this; his first name was legitimately Fishburne and he went through some *unimaginable* bullying in elementary/middle school for it. His parents thought it was ""dignified"" and he shouldn't ""worry so much about what other people think"", but he *hated it* and started going by his more common middle name in high school. The *day* he turned 18, he went to go get it legally changed.

Did his parents throw a hissy fit? Sure as fuck! They were pretty obnoxious about it for a good year or so. Refused to call him by his chosen name, lamented to the rest of his family about how cruel he was and how he was slapping them in the face-- but he buckled down with his boundary-setting. He'd end conversations if they called him by the wrong name, he'd refuse to take part in any whining about ""their feelings"" on the matter, and eventually they dropped it.

They still don't *like* it, mind-- and yours probably won't either. But *you* get to choose what you're called. *You're* the adult. And they'll probably fight back against it, but if you stay firm, they'll eventually have to just deal with it if they still want a relationship with you. (The good news in my friend's case was that the rest of his family was like 'well yeah what did you expect by naming him Fishburne lol' so he had that extra support; hopefully you're able to rally some yourself.)"
452,"And they didn't actually come clean , they just sort of admitted to what you saw photographic evidence of. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a bunch of tickle truth here."
453,"Schizophrenia is genetic with high risk factors, ongoing treatment/meds are necessary just to stay stable, it's a lot for most people to handle. And it's a perfectly viable reason for bowing out of the relationship, which he should do instead of holding it above her head."
454,"Yeah I'm completely baffled. The previous post said he reached out because he said he was ""out of anger and resentment"" and wanted to talk. Seems like he still has plenty of anger and resentment to continue to be manipulative and cruel."
455,And top marks to OP’s wife’s spidey senses. She knows a creep when she sees one.
456,"Yep, she's just as bad a guy who refuses to use condoms. OP, stop having sex with her."
457,"Yep. OP, there will always be some reason for disregarding your feelings. I’d cut my losses."
458,"You need to set boundaries. Blame your boss if you need to. ""I'm working now and can't have you tagging along and chatting. It could get me in trouble.""

Don't chat back. Put in ear buds (if you can) and ignore her after you've told her you can't chat. 

I understand your urge to protect her feelings but you're at risk here she need to think of yourself first."
459,"My first reaction was to question what you are doing, because I kind of don't understand what you wrote.

So first 

&gt; One day, at one of his friends birthday party, his friend made another statement to the other... something like “oh that’s why I couldn’t suck you off (hahahha). It was completely weird to me and I was taken aback.  I confronted him about this

So, I'm reading this as friend 1 says to friend 2; ""Hey, that's why I couldn't suck you off!"" and you confronted your husband about it like he had something to do with it.  Confronted is such an interesting word, like you got in his face angrily.

Is that what happened?  Someone other than your husband made a comment, so you got angry at him, even though he had nothing to do with it?

&gt; one year, there was a question about my cousins sexuality (he’s 18, never had a girlfriend, my family was discussing this amongst each other) He literally was so defensive and arguing my family down saying “why are y’all questioning him”, “this is crazy”, he kind of embarrassed me.

Your husband stood up for an 18 year old whose family felt it was appropriate for family members to discuss and question his sexuality because he's never had a girlfriend  and somehow you are embarrassed by your husband.  I would have been embarrassed to be related to the people gossiping and berating, myself.

Now, your husband has a friend and you are questioning it because he couldn't possibly need a friend - it's obviously got to be him having sexual feelings for the other person.  You are so sure of it that you went into his chat log and found he had deleted it.

He couldn't possibly have deleted it because he'd said something like; ""I don't know what to do.  My wife is convinced I'm hiding being gay or bi from her and her paranoia is ruining our relationship."
460,"This. Any tiny things you can outsource to feel less overwhelmed. Housecleaner and babysitter being the start. 

When you are ready, start taking walks with the younger kid in a large stroller, and get yourself a personal trainer. Do this for *yourself*, not for the husband. Exercise will make you feel happier. 

Can you set up times for your husband to supervise and interact with the older kid? Find something husband would like (new Lego set?) and bring out it when you leave the house with the younger one. Start with a half hour and work up from there. It sounds like he needs to learn how to interact with the kids. 

Your situation sounds really rough. Having young kids is hard for anyone, you have additional responsibilities with the appointments and extra care required.   Thinking of you."
461,"&gt;  How do I respond? 

&amp;#x200B;

By getting a divorce. 

Which you already are."
462,"I agree bringing up adoption and a sperm donor is a bad idea, listed it as an outside possibility.

I should have listed in my original post they absolutely want to have children and have said so mant times. And I assume they want their own biological children."
463,"I would’ve been out at the “I wish I didn’t have a girlfriend I had to train.”

You are not a dog - or a pet of any kind. You are a human being who deserves respect and communication. 

It’s honestly time to bounce. You do not need this malarkey."
464,"It sounds like a good time to re-evaluate whether you're better off with him or without him.  Which must sound harsh, but if he makes you feel worse about yourself, then it's something that's worth thinking about."
465,"PI here. We have several undergrads that work closely with grad students in the lab, and I could easily imagine this exact thing arising in my group.

Tell Adam. It's important and addressable. If it happened in my group I'd use it as a chance to have a group meeting discussion where we lay out ground rules for preparing joint projects. It doesn't have to be confrontational, it doesn't have to accuse anyone or hurt them. But it needs to be made clear what the expectations are for your own group (for example: are there some ""standard"" background slides or figures that everyone can use?) as well as in general (how do you properly cite a review figure that you've slightly modified?)

These are good things to revisit from time to time, and an event like this is a perfect catalyst."
466,"Not worth it. It's only going to be a frustrating experience for you. If your parents are still unable or unwilling to recognize your brother's shortcomings, a conversation isn't going to change their minds. Many parents are willfully ignorant about their children's bad behavior."
467,"Your plans are only ruined if you let them be ruined? ""That's too bad, aunt. We actually have plans from tomorrow until Friday, I won't be in town! I assume that you can keep doing your own thing, and I'll message you when I get back!""

In the meantime, do NOT allow them to stay in your house while you're gone. If you have a hidden key under a rock, get rid of it. They have their camper. They can go do their own thing without consideration of anyone else's plan. Well, SO CAN YOU!!!!! The world will go on. You can see them today for a few hours, and they can go around in the camper for 5 days and come back to visit you when you're back in town.

You gave them dates. You haven't heard anything from them. It is NOT YOUR JOB to bend over backwards and ruin your own plans because of a surprise. Go enjoy your vacation, and put all of this out of your head. You told your aunt that you will be gone from tomorrow until Friday. You clearly laid out your plans."
468,Shocked I had to scroll down this far to find this comment
469,"Get a restraining order, and if you can’t yet then at least get everything you said on record at the police station, so you have the beginnings of a paper trail if he escalates."
470,"&gt;and now hes sending me those pictures telling me that I must be the luckiest.

Ew

&gt;hes been making comments on how I need to work harder if I want to keep the catch that he is.

EWWW

&gt;And he says I'm not being supportive of him.

LMAO

How fucking typical.  All that time spent at the gym for giant guns and he's *still* the same ol' insecure man.  He's put in all this time and effort into 'fixing' himself and obviously it hasn't done a damn thing.  Not sure what to tell you -- he's gonna have to wake the fuck up one of these days."
471,"This is absolutely the case. I can't have kids either and was like this with my boyfriend for a while after telling him. Please be patient, and keep being supportive.tell her how you feel about her and maybe take some extra initiative to make her feel accepted. Even small gestures that show her that you are thinking of her can make a difference. Talk to your girl, she will appreciate it."
472,"my boyfriend and i are both bisexual, if he began engaging in those behaviors with men i knew he found extremely attractive, i would consider that a dealbreaker. (never mind the fact that she gets irrationally upset when you watch a fuckin TELEVISION SHOW). 

she’s probably projecting, honestly. i’d dump her."
473,That's so sad that it breaks my heart. :-(
474,"&gt;  Hes smart, I am not. Hes motivated easily, I am not. He wants more and more, I do not.

First off, who told you that you weren't smart? Because I'm thinking it's him. And I'm willing to bet that you are motivated, and you do want more -- but you respond to very different things than he does.

I'm sorry you are going through this. But your husband is wrong to say that he ""carried you."" And he's wrong to disrespect what you do for a living. I suspect, like other commenters have mentioned, that he is going to try and bully you into accepting shitty terms in the divorce. FUCK. THAT. Get an awesome divorce lawyer, and get everything you deserve."
475,"So instead of looking for an apology, I think you need to have a conversation about what is bothering him. Clearly something is and unfortunately he's not the type to address it himself.

Just another chore on the list of things to do."
476,Yeah. This isn't the second time he cheated. It's the second time OP found out.
477,"Yeah, I'm not excusing cheating in general. But if that stripper did anything to her, its rape. If ahe was so drunk that she couldnt move for 2 days after, I doubt she cohls consent to anything"
478,"&gt; Instead, you've held on to this ""wrong"" she did you.

2 weeks after my ex and I *met*, I went clubbing with my first ex since we were still friends at the time. Oh man.... what a shit storm that was. She claimed I ""cheated"" on her and held onto this ""wrong"" for the rest of our relationship, which was around a year and a half. Eventually, she used it against me when she actually cheated on me a year later. Told me that we were even and she still couldn't forgive me for that night. 

Not saying that OP is hanging on to this to use as ammo for later on, but it's a possibility and quite a shitty reason for it."
479,"I agree with your assessment based on the amount of DNA, as well as the ages of all involved. This is almost certainly your half-sister.

Does this half-sister know your name or any identifying information about you? Because, if she's motivated, she could probably figure this out on her own. If there's any potential at all that she may call up your parents one day, I think you should say something now to your father. 

I'm not going to pretend that there won't be consequences potentially. There will be disruption to your parents' lives even if it goes well. I just also don't know how you can go forward sitting on this secret, hoping it never comes out, and then facing the possibility of admitting that you knew the whole time.

I can't fault you for it either way. You're in a tough spot."
480,It’s okay to be annoyed just know that yes it’s completely normal for (especially younger) children to watch the same thing over and over again. I’d imagine your parents are just as annoyed but are probably used to it due to raising 2 1/2 children and know the drill. Roll with it it doesn’t last forever.
481,You still feel terrible because she has been putting in the effort to make you feel terrible. :(
482,"Emmmm.... Nope...

I personally don't think you need an advice, you made your decision long ago, stick to it."
483,"A lot of people start their career and then earn an MBA, concurrent to working. He was probably fairly experienced before earning that specific credential."
484,"This doesn’t sound like a mistake. It is abuse, plain and simple. If your spouse is backing you into a corner and threatening you, it is abuse. You need to seriously think about this relationship. Is she blowing up at little stuff? Do you feel afraid to be around her? Do you walk on eggshells all the time because you’re afraid to piss her off? Do you deliberately avoid noticing stuff she does to avoid an argument? Do you have to ask permission to do anything? Seriously. Think about it. This could be your chance to get out."
485,"Could you kick him out, instead? Are your mom and dad handy? Maybe they could come to your house and finish install the new shower curtain or painting the den or whatever nonsense he is refusing to finish, and you can sleep in your own bed. Hand him his tent and tell him not to come back until he wants to be a father and a partner."
486,"I was confused for a bit because your entire post is about the feelings of this guy who is apparently your ex? He's your ex, why do you have 8 paragraphs of text about your ex's feelings? You sound way too enmeshed with him in an unhealthy way. Like you're still dating him or something. You need to pull back, wayyyyy back."
487,"My boyfriend struggled with something similar for awhile.

The few things that helped us were 1) couples counseling 2) The microwave/crockpot analogy on sexuality and 3) ( this was once couples counseling helped him understand ) telling him what makes me feel like more than a sex toy. I.E. a long intimate hug and whispering in my ear.

After he began to understand, and respect my boundaries better, I began to try and consciously incorporate more non sexual touch for him to feel loved. ( such as holding hands, stroking his arms, etc)

Once he began to understand that he was pushing me away and I understood that he desperately wanted to be closer it got easier. But couples counseling was a must for this to occur.

Good luck :)"
488,"It's 2019.  There are going to be plenty of guys who are proud of everything you're about.  Feel free to act embarrassed that your bf is so conventional.  Just kinda kidding, but I think you may be a mismatch.  I have worked around creative people most of my life, and other creative people ""get it.""  Ultra-conventional people just do not.  You need someone who ""gets"" you for the long haul.  It's not a failing of his character--just a mismatch, in my opinion.  Sounds like he hangs around conventional types...nothing wrong with that, but they will not ""get"" you and you won't enjoy being treated like you have three heads.  


One of the women I work with thrifts and blogs about it and salvages stuff and helps prisoners and the poor, and her husband is an accountant.  It can work, but the spouse has to be really proud of your creativity, not trying to stifle it."
489,"He seems to show a lot of emotional immaturity and possibly abusive behavior.  I agree you need time away.  I would, tell him where you are going because it is his child and it would be the correct thing to do UNLESS you truly feel your safety is at risk.

Instead of him figuring out what he wants- focus on what you want and whom you want it with.  ASsume he is going to be just as you see him, not what he could turn into if he got massive help."
490,"This is such a great update. 

  
I was told the same thing as a 16 year old and I just decided to play the game for the people I needed to like me. 

It took much longer for me to realise that genuinely being a nice person was actually an end goal in and of itself because when I was approaching the world from a nicer frame of mind, it responded.

You've learned something many people take much longer to learn and bloody good for you. Keep it up :)"
491,"My husband (very straight, as far as I can tell) can tell me which of his three best friends has the biggest penis. He knows this because they all drunkenly compared once when on holiday in Mallorca. 

None of the OP’s points (except the text messages) set off any yellow or red flags to me. I would’ve also defended the cousin, just because I don’t think it’s cool to question a person’s sexuality like that."
492,"The balance of emotional labor in your relationship is weighted so heavily to you, it’s unreal. This is definitely not normal. He’s clearly not clued in on anything; and he’s probably come to rely on your ability to juggle your life as well as his. When you’re in a relationship, sure, you take care of each other, but you’re also mature adults who support one another. You definitely have to have a serious conversation about this. Try and prioritise how it’s impacting you. Starting with how you feel unimportant to him could be good, but you know him best, and you can judge what will impact him enough to actually (ba dum tiss) listen to what you’re saying. Honestly, you’ve got the patience of a saint. This would drive me up the wall. Good luck. Update us!"
493,"I skimmed over your first post and more fully read this one and the conversation between you and your father. While I don't have much advice, I will say that I cut out my father going on two years now and I've had a much happier life because of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The messages between you and your dad remind me so much of me and my father. My father is a narcissist who is the definition of the narcissist's prayer (if you haven't read it, I recommend googling it). I know it was the heat of the moment and I've had nasty conversations so similar to what you just had with my own father, but realize that conversations like this will just give your dad fuel for the image he wants to paint of you.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be no convincing him about who he is and what a shit dad he is. He's not going to realize that he's not apologizing for anything and he's not going to realize that he's a mythomaniac. All he's going to see is that you're attacking him when he reached out with an open heart (that's the way he'll spin it to everyone else). You are totally in the right and it feels good to get it all out. But if he ever approaches you again, just walk away."
494,"I felt ok not talking about it, but it felt wrong to me to flat out lie when asked."
495,"Buying presents and otherwise stepping in as a ""surrogate parent"" for another person's child is a potential minefield.  Setting aside the reality that sometimes people do have inappropriate affairs with their children's friends, it could be a real slap in the face to that child's real parents-- as though you're saying ""You aren't doing a good enough job raising your child, so I'm going to have to do it for you.""  Especially when, as you noted, that child's parents have psychosocial issues like mental illness and histories of abuse.

I'll venture an educated guess that the accusation of attempted seduction isn't really the core issue.  Probably she's more offended by the presumption and implication, and is reaching for things to justify her anger or to hurt your feelings.  In either case, really your only choice is to respect her wishes and back away from her son, at least until he's legally able to make these decisions for himself."
496,"She needs to grow up. Two options here, she can sit down and learn a new skill because she's a grown woman and it's not that difficult,  or she can hand all the decision making to you and deal with those decisions...like a grown woman. 

She doesn't get to be upset, she's an adult, with a child. Unless she got married to a damn billionaire, she needs to get a handle on this one way or another."
497,"Have you spent a day with the twins on your own? How much housework did you get done? Try it. 

It's not a you vs her problem. It's a 'how can we keep up with house work and feed the family'  maybe there are things she does that you don't think are a priority? Maybe the laundry can wait until the weekend? Maybe she's really struggling to get through a day until you get home? Work it through with her rather than just expecting things to magically be different."
498,"Yes, they'll eat rice so at least they will be able to have that. When it comes to chicken/fish though, they will not eat anything on the bone or fish with the head or scales still on. Some other commenters had a really good suggestion to make a map with grocery stores on it, since they'll all be staying together in a place with cooking facilities.   


My fiancé hadn't actually thought about it until I brought up the subject with him! He's definitely worried that his grandfather will lose a lot of weight while we are there, but thinks they will be able to make do with cooking by themselves."
499,"I know some people are saying you’re overreacting, but go with your gut. You are being made to feel uncomfortable and as if your boundaries don’t matter. No one has a right to your body, no matter what. This whole “she probably just loves you so much” thing is bull. If this was purely out of motherly love, she would care that you are wildly uncomfortable and that she‘s giving you an icky feeling. 

If your mom is typically a reasonable person, try a frank conversation. Don’t let her guilt trip you. You are in the right. 

If you believe her motives to be actually straight up bad for all this, consider what some other commenters mentioned, like a lock on your bedroom door. Set an alarm and wake yourself up before she can have the opportunity to come to you and disregard your boundaries when waking you up in the morning. 

If all else fails, seek another housing situation. And also consider seeking counseling so you can work through all this."
500,"&gt; I eventually told her my hands had been tied.

That's shitty. You're either a united front with your wife or you're not. Apparently you're not. You used your wife as a scapegoat.

I'm sorry, your wife is not to blame for not wanting to take in a teenager with drug and mental health issues. And you seem fine to blame your sister's woes on your wife instead of growing a spine and telling her it was a joint decision.

Your sister's woes are not your wife's fault. I mean, your parents were even having problems with her and you expect your wife to take on her drama? You need to stop blaming her and moping. And stop enabling your sister. She's responsible for her own choices."
501,"This is great! Thank you so much, I definitely didn’t know how to broach this and this along with another commenters script it what I think I will use."
502,"So you waited a month after having dinner with the ex before saying anything? That does sound a little suspicious. You could've easily told him when you were at the restaurant with your ex. It sounds like you're making excuses to not tell your bf, he isn't being childish. With that said, you need to apologize for not mentioning it sooner and understand his feelings. You can already prove you weren't cheating but he's probably most upset at you for not saying something sooner"
503,"Great, thoughtful response u/humgaryforchile !

A couple of things to keep at the back of your mind as you begin begin reconstructing your life...
 
You can't fix all your issues at one time. Focus on those that will help to break your current logjam. Once you start the process, you'll be surprised how things begin falling into place for you.

Offer your husband a backrub, with no pressure / hints of  sex. Rebuilding intimacy is also a process.

To paraphrase the Chinese sage Lao Tzu, ""The successful person doesn't reach for greatness. Rather, she achieves greatness by a series of small steps.""

Good luck friend."
504,Women can be vicious to each other. This has deliberate attack on her happiness written all over it
505,Your BF threw you under the bus with his family and let’s his brother call you a bitch/ be abusive ( sleep deprivation). Why are you with someone who won’t even have your back on this?
506,Yeah. I’ll have to talk to him again. If I can get a really low floor transfer I could get more and more time away from her. Generally the first floor is for more experienced workers older than me. Getting an excuse to keep her away from me would be something he could offer that would fix this.
507,"This is one of those situations that’s going to show you the future of this relationship. I think you’re gonna have to be honest with her that you really don’t like these kinds of surprises and you’re very disappointed because you were looking forward to your first romantic vacation alone with her even though you like the BFF and her boyfriend. Keep the focus on how you feel rather than telling her how much she f*ked up, even if it’s true. 

Let her know that going forward she MUST ask you first before making or changing big plans."
508,"Yep. OP's whole post is about the ex. She needs to let go, stop obsessing over him, and grey rock him, if she's choosing to not get him booted from the program."
509,"High school teacher here. I agree with this. After you contact the police and have something on record, THEN tell admin. Things sometimes have a way of disappearing if the school's public image is at stake."
510,"A. Helicopter parenting
B. Previous untrustworthy actions
C. Office is too far from home to be readily available

Pick one, I guess. My kids are 10/13 and I'm fine with them being home, but I have to be reachable in case of emergency. I'm never more than a 15-minute drive away."
511,"\&gt; She proceeded to become very defensive and told me that her previous long term ex BF never questioned this, that she could date any guy in our lovely southwestern hometown, and that I'd be extremely lucky to have a child with her vs actually addressing my concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

Forget just making sure you're providing the contraceptives, I'd think really hard about having sex at all with someone who responded like this to a very grownup and modest request for confirmation that the birth control you're relying upon is actually going to be doing some, you know, birth-controlling. Yikes."
512,I'd probably wait until you guys are deeper in the relationship. Your mother isn't over it yet and she might get more PTSD from your boyfriend after finding out...
513,I don’t think it’s too much to ask of a 29 year old man you are in a relationship to call while on vacation. What he did was mean and hurtful.
514,"Dear people,

I need to inform you that I am resigning as house/dog sitter as of Saturday. 

I am sorry it has come to this, however, this dog was not properly trained or adjusted to his new home as we had agreed, and this situation has deteriorated to the point it is affecting my health. 

Dog 2’s transition to a new home followed by his immediate adjustment to a new person in the home has led to high anxiety, fearfulness, and multiple daily accidents including diarrhea and vomiting, making this situation unmanageable. I personally have had to cut back on my work hours, have not been able to sleep full nights and have spent most of my time dealing with managing his accidents and anxiety. My personal life and health are deteriorating and this situation is becoming rapidly unmanageable.

I will be departing Saturday; please let me know who I can be handing off care of the animals to at that time."
515,"I agree with others, but you should also consider that your ex may have asked his mother to not speak with you anymore. My parents experienced a similar situation, with my dad getting angry at my grandmother for talking to my mom. It may be out of her hands."
516,"Even if she felt like she knew you, it's still a disgusting violation to post ANY personal information about you without your consent, particularly if it's not even factual information."
517,"I can't believe this comment isn't higher up, he literally told her he wishes he had a different girlfriend and people are like ""you should try harder with sex"""
518,"This is excellent advice.  There is no need to suddenly sell and move, especially with baby on the way.  Wait and see over the next couple of years.  And it seems as tho your partner could use some antianxiety meds IMO.  The worst thing to do would be to live in a fixer upper with very young children.  O hell no."
519,"In addition to contacting the police, contact any of his family through Facebook. Don’t wait until he actually threatens you to do this."
520,"Honestly, I’d be a little weirded out too, but only because I could never imagine being that affectionate with my family. 
However, I know this is normal for other people. I’d have a convo with him about it because that is a fairly large reaction for something this minor. You should tell him to chill, and that you don’t want to keep having conversations about this topic. 
Also, I noticed that you said that when he makes you upset you don’t say anything and try to forget about it. Don’t do that. Seriously, healthy relationships have open communication about how each other’s behavior affects one another."
521,"OP, she started posting before she ever met you. Have you ever seen the cat she claims to have? Like in person, not just on the gram. You are a local celebrity in her fandom. Please don’t take this lightly. It’s not nice to consider, but she may be dangerous."
522,"&gt; My question is, how do I actually end a friendship actively? 

You simply just stop inviting him anywhere, stop proactively talking to him and slow fade him when he reaches out to you."
523,"Yeah, I agree with the other comments. You’re only 23! You are YOUNG. Your body, although you have had a baby, is almost definitely smoking  hot. I’m sure you are a beautiful mama! It sounds like he has his own insecurities and is gaslighting you/emotionally abusing you. I have a history of eating disorders as well and my husband would never DARE mention my weight, no matter how angry he was, because you don’t bring up someone’s triggers for mental illness. That is straight up abuse.
Unfortunately I feel you may be holding on to something that isn’t there anymore. You deserve to be happy. You’re so young... I would hate for you to be stuck in a loveless marriage when so many young single men would love to be with you, yknow?"
524,This is probably the most sound advice. Yes I do feel like she is putting on a show. I’ll just ignore it. Thank you.
525,"This honestly brings back some really bad and traumatizing experiences. I was with someone whom acted like this and we actually ended up in an engagement.  It became so toxic and it still leaves me wondering when did I lose myself in all of it. It's a constant push and pull. It's draining and exhausting. You are communicating your feelings and somehow you end up having to comfort them or apologize for feeling upset. That's fucked up. Your feelings are justified to yourself. Whether or not he agrees with it shouldn't matter but YOU should matter enough that he respects you and tries to be there for you in order to help alleviate your feelings of discomfort. 

You are now presented with a choice. Please do not continue with this draining and vicious cycle. Don't allow yourself to continue in a relationship where you are unheard and your concerns are cast aside. You shouldn't ever be made to feel as if your feelings are not worthy of being listened to. You deserve someone who respects you and values you. Something stable. Communicating your concerns should NOT be catastrophic but should be proactive. 

I wish you all the best. You're so strong and I believe in you!"
526,"It's true that healthy relationships do have their ups and downs, though. It's about context. 


Healthy ups and downs: few and far betweens, usually downs are related to health problems, deaths, job loss, etc. Couples get through by leaning on and being supportive of each other and communicating. Ups and downs in a normal relationship are challenges you and your partner work through together. 


Toxic ups and downs: occur on a regular, frequent basis, downs often have no discernable trigger, usually come paired with abusive behavior, passive aggression, and emotional abuse, communication fails and then it all gets swept under the rug until next time and nothing ever gets resolved."
527,Show him how big of a dump a girl can take by dumping him.
528,"The first and second question you should ask is ""Are you afraid that something bad is going to happen to me on the track? Or that I'm going to leave you behind somehow?""

Something tells me it's one of the two. Talk to her and ask her what the problem is."
529,"&gt; that she could date any guy in our lovely southwestern hometown, and that I'd be extremely lucky to have a child with her vs actually addressing my concerns.

Run dude."
530,"At this point you’ve made 3 posts to r/relationships about your boyfriend. Each one worse than the next. Either leave him like you have been advised, or stop posting. This is who he is. He’s not going to change because he has it good. If you won’t leave then you accept his miserable self as he is."
531,"Yeah, particularly since he didn’t even say anything, though I guess that would have been him breaking his silent treatment.

So far in this relationship I have always reached out to him, regardless of rather I felt like I started it or he did, or whatever. I have always viewed us as a team where we both make mistakes and we succeed and fail together. I am starting to think he does not see things this way."
532,"&gt; I’m just so worried about being friends and seeing him have a connection with someone else. 

You're still in love with him, so you need to cut ALL contact as soon as possible. Your husband is trying to let you down gently by still being affectionate and still promising love. This all needs to stop now. 

You need to divide all your possessions, all shared assets, cancel all upcoming social events you were going to go through together, and completely, 100% separate your lives so you can go through months, if not years, of never seeing his face and never hearing his name.

""No way!"" I hear you say. ""I love him, and having him in my life as a friend is better than not having him at all! Cutting him out is too cruel, we can get through this together.""

If you keep him in your life, here's what will happen. You'll still hang out, you'll still have fun, and you'll even find yourself forgetting you are even broken up. See! It's fine!  Then, one day when you're hanging out with friends, your ex-husband will introduce you to his new boyfriend. And you'll see the way he looks at a new boyfriend, in a way he hasn't looked at you in years (maybe he has *never* looked at you that way), and it will destroy your heart WORSE than it is destroyed now. And suddenly that whole ""just friends"" facade is destroyed and only a broken abandoned you remains. And this trauma might happen in public, right in front of your ex and his new boyfriend. 

Trust me. Break up now. Ugly cry now. Eat icecream by the carton now. Don't put it all off until he finds someone new and you have to face the truth, because it just adds a new layer of humiliation to your abandonment and loss."
533,"&gt;As a pretty independent married woman, I don't know. **She didn't lie, she was busy.** She had plans with her girlfriends. Her free time is hers to spend as she pleases.  Perhaps she wanted to get down with her girls. No big deal.

But she did. She said she had reading to do that night, and I'm sure as heck she wasn't reading at the nightclub."
534,"You got social passions or then the best thing to do is go volunteer. You'll meet largely women, and are slightly more likely to meet the sorts of woman who can build substantial friendships and shared interests, not just form cliques.

Frankly, I think you also need to let go of your assumptions about other women. It's true that is a different sort of rhythm to friendships between women, but it's certainly not true that men have more ""universally applicable"" conversations. This sort of bias might hold you back from meeting women who are actually compatible with you as friends, because they make one or two comments you find overly gendered or ""girl-talky"". When you hear ""girl-talk"" from someone you think might be a potential friend, instead of writing them off, consider that she doesn't know you well yet either and she might be trying to invite you in by relying on cliches or conversations topics that are 'safe'.

I'd also advise not to go into this looking to make a bestie, or looking for a deeply intimate friendship. It's a good goal to keep in mind, but it shouldn't be the driving force. Instead, go into it looking to develop some skills and learn to relate to a group of people you have limited experience relating to - fellow women. Go where women who share your interests are."
535,"Oh god. I'm reluctant to give you advice as I have just broken up with someone who did exactly this (alongside a whole host of other insidious things). I actually posted about him here several months ago and I wish I hadn't deleted it because I received so much excellent advice, but one thing I remember is 'sealioning' - you should Google it. What your SO is doing is deliberate, and it's a thing.

Another comment that stands out in my memory is 'you can't reason with someone who is committed to misunderstanding you'. 

My ex-SO used to claim not to understand the most basic, simple explanations I gave him, whether it was about my feelings, my political views, or something totally inane and irrelevant. It's a form of manipulation and I couldn't see it until I was out of it. 

I hope your situation isn't as bad as mine was. Go with your gut."
536,"Much like other posters have said, I think it's awesome that you have the self-awareness to admit that your negative internal feelings are having external effects on others. I used to do the same thing as you! I would shut down and give the silent treatment to my boyfriend when something didn't go my way. Not because I thought it was okay to do that, but because I was feeling everything so strongly inside, I didn't feel like I could do anything but pout. Obviously I was wrong and that was immature. For me, it took the repeated realization that everything would be ok if someone cancelled on me. Yeah, it would suck. But I'd get through it and see them again. I'd find something else to do. It also taught me to like spending time with myself. I used to hate ""not having plans"" and would subconsciously punish people for cancelling on me because they were putting me in a spot I didn't want to be in. Once I truly internalized that it wouldn't be the end of the world if plans changed or things didn't go my way, I was actually able to start letting things roll off my back. My actionable advice would be to start acting like you're okay with things even if you're upset. You can say ""I'm disappointed, but I totally get it."" Fake it till you make it method. One day, you might realize you're actually more flexible and unaffected by plans changing."
537,"Get therapy. Work on your obsessiveness, your depression, your suicidal tendencies and on your self-esteem. And find a BF who doesn’t have a history of cheating."
538,Not to mention they’re on baby #2 so she was barely out of her teenage years when she got pregnant the first time :/
539,"I didn't read anywhere in there where you brought this to her attention ...unless I skimmed passed something that mentions it.

That would be your first step. How can she change if she doesn't even know she's possibly doing something wrong? Especially as she has received any complaints."
540,"Yeah, I think it would be a very bad idea to tell her, OP. The connection doesn't change anything about your boyfriend or what happened to her. It seems like it would benefit him to get it off his chest, but I don't see why she could possibly benefit from the information.

Importantly, has your mom seen a therapist to work on this trauma? They'd be the first person I would ask."
541,"&gt; It somehow doesn’t feel right to ask her

Well that all depends on why you're asking and where your head is at. If it's from a place of ""I don't trust you"" then asking isn't going to go down well. If it's from a place of ""i'm just uncomfortable with it and would really appreciate us being a team on this one to move forward"" then I think you're fine."
542,"30M here, i don't find this scenario abusive. My bigger guess is that he:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - got cold feet after realising how serious things were gonna get soon

2 - his friends teased him a ton about how serious things are getting

3 - he thinks he can get a better deal from his female friends and does not want to settle down with you"
543,You're caught in an abuse cycle. There's a reason what she did is considered a criminal offense.
544,"Exactly. Or depending on how you're looking at freedom, you don't lose your freedom when you are free to be with the person that you love every single day. If that's not where we want to be, then gtfoh."
545,"Exactly. Does he expect her to eventually be ""cured"" of schizophrenia? Because in reality that's never going to happen, it's in her genetics. Yes, she can treat it and keep it manageable, possibly for decades even, but it will never not be apart of her.

But OP is a rockstar for recognizing and keeping her symptoms in check. OP find someone else who will recognize you and your struggle for the warrior you are."
546,"Yeah, me too. I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people,  but when any of his friends or family asked why I was canceling the wedding, I would be straight up honest about it."
547,"I would simply tell her that 2 months is far too short of a time to even consider getting married. If you’re enjoying your time with her let her know that and that you really want to see where this is headed, but there is no way that you’re going to be getting married this soon. If she leaves at that point it is best just to let her go and to move on."
548,"Gosh- that is a really scary thought, but maybe a perfectly sensible one. 
...another reason to not end up with his kid at this point."
549,"Yeah, that maniac that shot up that newsroom, I read he first showed signs of being dangerous and crazy by harassing some girl from HS from decades earlier on Facebook."
550,"Most people seem to advocate part time assistance (childcare and or help at home), but I would suggest to also consider getting full time help with childcare and going back to work. It sounds like OP is in a rut, out of energy, and like she doesn’t interact much with people outside of the family, and a job can be a great energy giver here as well as will force some degree of social contact.

Exercise is yet another great boost of energy, and will also help with OPs self-doubt."
551,"I can't find the part of your post where it says he cheated on you before, and I hate to agree with this, but it does seem like there is a correlation between partners who suddenly and inexplicably stop desiring sex and cheating.

Edit: it makes a lot of sense for someone to stop wanting sex with one person if they're getting it somewhere else. Does this seem like a possibility, or is he home all the time?"
552,I get so sad for people that say shit like “all relationships have their ups and downs.” No they don’t! Don’t put your problems on me! My relationship has been like a sturdy boat on a calm ocean since day one. Same for most relationships in my circle of friends and family.
553,"&gt; Acting like the BF, who was her rock for the entire thing, is a ""cruel"" jerk for being concerned about this issue is absurd.

He’s not being a cruel jerk for being concerned about this issue. He’s a cruel jerk because of the way he talks to her about it. Saying “I’m concerned about getting married/having kids because of your mental health problems” is VERY different from “no one else would have stayed with you”."
554,Not everything is about you dude. You hurt her enough. Let her be. You can take the lessons you learned here moving forward and having healthier relationships.
555,"There's a lot going on here that I suspect needs more context to make sense, but...

Your mother appears to be toxic and untrustworthy. Stop trying. Avoid letting her be around your daughter, you don't need to let that damage continue another generation. Appreciate your dad."
556,"Honestly this is a blessing in disguise. He is a dirtbag and it’s better to have found out what type of man he is now than a few years from now or after getting married to him! 

You will be ok. For right now, focus on yourself and spend time with your friends and family. Years from now you will look back and question why you cried over him at all. Plus, now you have an opportunity to meet someone way better than him who will be respectful to you and your relationship."
557,"It is going to be a touchy subject, but what do you have to loose? A few uncomfortable days stuck in an apartment with someone you'll be leaving shortly anyways? Risk it.

Don't question her attachment to the dog. Don't talk about the crate or about saving him. Insults aren't gonna work here. Instead focus purely on yourself and tell her you really want a dog and that you've bonded with him really deeply. Tell her you spend a lot of time alone and wont have any friends in the new city and would definitely be getting a dog anyways... but you really love this one. Remind her how much easier it is to hang out with people spontaneously or take little trips when you don't have a dog, by talking about the fact you won't and can't be doing those things...

Don't offer money right away. Let the idea sit for a bit and then say ""Look, I know you put a lot into having a pet all these years, what if I bought him from you?"""
558,"This is exactly what it is. I had a best friend whose mom and stepdad just ignored her. They treated her like an unwanted burden, while her siblings were spoiled. It was like Cinderella. My mom is an extremely giving person, and would buy her dinner and little things that she needed. 

Well, my friend's mother got very upset and said my mom was trying to replace her. In reality, she just felt guilty because she was forced to acknowledge the fact that she was treating her daughter like crap. I think she was also pissed that my family saw something in this friend that she and her husband did not.  

So with boys, it seems like ""you're trying to seduce him"" is the go-to accusation. With girls, it's ""you're trying to be her mother!"" Either way, it's bullshit. They're just trying to make you feel wrong for helping their kid, and using an accusation that will make you take a big step back."
559,"You're describing rape. 

Your fiancé was repeatedly raping you.

Leave him and consider pressing charges."
560,He's a boyquaintance
561,"Book the honeymoon. 

Make it a priority. 

You sound like you want to care and be involved but have taken a step back. Why? Is it your view of yourself? Of the relationship? Of him? 

Or is it a bigger depression? Are you excited about anything in life?"
562,"File for child support and give them his home address to serve the papers.  

He’s not going to be an involved parent, but you’ll get some money for the baby and his wife will be informed without you having to tell her directly."
563,"&gt;She boils all of her vegetables until they are able to be cut with a spoon, does not use any spices or salt during cooking, and refuses to eat meat that is less than well done. They also do not use garlic or onion in their cooking because it is deemed too spicy.

What the fuck?"
564,This seems like a pretty big reaction/spiral of anxiety from someone who also does a bunch of recreational drugs... Take a deep breath. Lie down and rest. Then ask him about it calmly later. One little bag of powder doesn't mean he's a closet drug addict. Maybe it's been there for months and he forgot about it. Maybe it belongs to a friend.
565,If you want to lose the love of your wife then enable your toxic sister like you seem to want to. Have you any idea what it means to a woman to have someone wish that her baby would die? You may claim to have completely different views on life than your family but I have my doubts on this.
566,"I'm going to be the odd one out, and say that it might be a problem, if it is interfering with how your boyfriend is priotized in your life or is affecting how much energy you or to your relationship. Affair proofing a relationship means consciously priortizing your partner. Google ""relationship walls and window"" for an analogy on how to protect a long term relationship."
567,"Ha! His actions would be a deal breaker for me. This would fall squarely under ""Too dumb to date.""

It's not cute that he thinks precious little women can't take big shits. That's not a sweet, sorta benevolent sexism at play. It's just super, duper stupid. And the fact that he jumped to ""You cheated on me."" when surprised by fact that women poop is a **huge** red flag. Is this the first time he's tossed out accusations like this? It seems to me you'd have to be rather suspicious and insecure to start with if that is where your head goes right away...

He's put you in a profoundly unfair and loose-loose situation. What if your poop isn't big enough next time? Is he going to go on insist you cheated? Are you gonna have to call him into the bathroom every time for the next two months so he feels he has a better grasp of a ""normal sized lady poop""? Are you gonna SnapChat each time before you flush?

It's him who should be begging for a ""Second Chance"" here. He was 100% outta line to accuse you like that and his suggested solution is as moronic as it is disrespectful. He is double-down on the dumb here.

I say let this be deal breaker for you, and a funny story you tell someday in the future about the man who was so dumb he didn't know that everybody poops."
568,Yeah the friends seem to have made this happen more than a little suspicious about them. Almost deliberately
569,I agree with giving the information to your dad alone.  He may not even recall the woman's name and that's why he hasn't said anything.  I admit I don't recall the full name of a couple of brief liaisons back in the late '60s.
570,Sounds like she needs a therapist
571,"&gt;something about this post I find really disturbing

Same here.    


He's letting this hypothetical, perfect version of his life keep him from thoroughly being present and enjoying the life he *does* have. He's going to miss out on wonderful times with his family if he keeps longing for a different life, and resenting them for not being the idealized versions of themselves."
572,"The worse she acts, the more it justifies their decision."
573,"I don't think they meant sexual fetishising you, it's more like this person is a stalker doesn't see you as a person but an item that interests them.

I would feel very violated knowing all the early conversations were just a ploy to figure out if you were this person.  Nothing about this is healthy, this isnt a safe situation for you.  

I agree you should block and ghost her.  If she still persists then you know you do need to escalate the situation faster than would normally make sense.  Please do what is needed to help you feel better but also be safe."
574,"I broke off an engagement days after it happened and even in the moment I knew it was the best decision I had ever made. 

I know the weird limbo feeling of am I wrong and did I do the right thing and the feeling of relief that washes over you when you let yourself stop feeling guilty for breaking it off. 

The wash of relief will win out."
575,"Plenty of women/girls feel really REALLY bad about having to reject somebody, especially if it's somebody they care about. It sounds like that's what's going on here."
576,"Are you getting a steal on rent? If not just be upfront. 

&gt;yo I’m broke as hell could you not eat my groceries"
577,"You and your mother are both wrong.   You actually can't afford the expensive wardrobe you bought and she's wrong to abuse you rather than talked about ways to learn better financial management.

Now that you have a basic work wardrobe, work on learning about the realities of supporting yourself.   Do you live at home?   If so, start learning what the necessities of life cost and budget to cover them.   How much would rent cost somewhere else?   How much does your mom pay in utilities.   What if something happened to your car and you had to get a new one right away, could you pay for it?  

Your friends on social media may be spending a lot of money today and continue that way.  Five years from now, they will also be complaining about credit card debt and wondering why they never have any money.   Enroll in a financial planning class now to learn how to allocate your money to avoid all that."
578,"Yeah the math makes this creepy. Pretty sure if the husband is the one bringing up moving back to his country he will most likely find another young, impressionable girl."
579,"Me too. I read that whole thing and was like ""damn, OP is a good damn lioness.""

You did so well, OP, and you made so many hard decisions in such a short time frame, without even hesitating. I am proud of you."
580,"The fact that this keeps getting talked about in the context of “slip ups” makes me think no one is being super responsible here. GF was smart to insist on condoms but sex doesn’t “just happen.” They CAN choose not to have sex, they just don’t,  Condoms are upsetting your boyfriend because they are removing the illusion of sex “just happening,” which isn’t a thing.

Do not get on the pill secretly. You guys need more communication not less. I would argue that the only path forward is that both of you agree not to initiate sex. However, you two should both agree ahead of time that if one of you doesn’t keep their end of the bargain and does initiate sex (which is, incidentally, not cool based on your agreement), both of you need to stop what you’re doing, acknowledge that you’re going to have sex, and take appropriate precautions."
581,"Your husband is right. They are being toxic.

""I appreciate your concern, however we will parent our children in the way we believe to be right. You can either accept that with a generous and loving heart, or you can cut yourselves off from us. Times change and our children are ours, this is our decision to make."""
582,"Do not uproot your life and move for a man who won’t commit to you. You are young but it’s been 10 years, your boyfriend should be able to give you a straight answer on whether or not he’s ready for the next step. Anything but an enthusiastic yes means no, he will not make that promise or commitment."
583,"Trust me, people who are home all the time can cheat even if it doesn't seem like they have time. Claiming to be caught in traffic when he's meeting his affair partner for a quicky, hookups over his lunch break, ""boss needs me to stay late,"" etc.

Even if he isn't physically cheating, an emotional affair can be just as damaging :/"
584,"&gt; she said it was just for fun

What kind of defense is that? How would that make anything okay?

&gt; she's never done anything with him

She's sent him nudes and told him repeatedly she wants him to fuck her. That's quite a lot of ""anything"" she's been doing with him.

&gt; she said it's because I see her every day

Same question for the first quote. What, does she only get off to the forbidden thrill of cheating, then?

&gt; she can use pre-pregnancy nudes

... she just... held on to these? For over a year? What, was this some kind of ""just in case"" idea she's had since before your kid was conceived? 

&gt; I don't want our kid to have separated parents

I grew up wirh separated parents and honestly, it was way better than for the few years when they were together. The separation was perfectly amicable and civil, they never fought over child support (they came to an arrangement early on and always respected it) or custody or visits or anything like that (if we wanted to visit or live with Dad, the only issue was the time &amp; money requirement for flying out there). They didn't even bother pushing the legal divorce through until some time after I was an adult.

When they were together they argued fairly often, and I've overheard brief lines over the years that faintly suggested potential cheating during that time? 

So it's hardly the end of the world.

It *is* the end of your relationship, though. But she's the one who made that choice. Cheating is super disrespectful, especilally if it's ongoing and they never confessed on their own. IMO, staying after that would indicate a massive lack of self-respect on your part. 

Also, this is super petty but I really want you to tell her you'd like to break up ""jUsT fOr FuN""."
585,"&gt;Tl;dr: Ex left and came back now, what to do? 

Tell her you've moved on, then block her. She's only coming back to you because you feel ""safe."" As soon as she gets bored again, she'll be back to doing the same shit she did before you broke up. 

Leave her in the past."
586,"If you move back, you will be manipulated into supporting both them and your brother."
587,"&gt;And its not a creepy story bc we married

Being married doesn't negate the fact that a grown man dated a teenager in high school."
588,"Actually technically I can, I found that out today. BHA is for dependents as well, and they can put him in a dorm. I however, love my parents and want their support."
589,"Typically people who are BASICALLY your boyfriend but are reluctant to CALL themselves your boyfriend are keeping that distance because they are afraid of committing/want to keep their options open.

It's not fair to you if what you're looking for is a boyfriend.

I think y'all gotta shit or get off the pot, as it were."
590,"Your self-awareness and willingness to truly engage with what people are commenting is just delightful.

*internet fist bump*"
591,Also can I just say that is an INSULTINGLY bad lie.
592,"I think it's hilarious that you made a PowerPoint, but I'm glad it worked. Good for you."
593,"YES. 

A long time ago I went to a bachelorette where there was a stripper. The bride was mortified and nearly in tears, but went along with it to be a “good sport”. I told her that if she wanted the stripper to leave her alone (he was doing his gross grindy dance around her), just say the word. She did."
594,"He suggested couples therapy. I'm open to it, of course. I just ... can't process any of this for the time being. Typing it out has helped in organizing my thoughts a little."
595,You've been with the man for more than 10 years.  You are attuned to a shift in his behavior and your owe it to your marriage to sort it out.  Have you thought about asking him to come to a therapy session with you?
596,"Asking you to lie to people about someone being alive is not reasonable.

She's putting her difficulty with communication and boundaries on you by asking  you to lie. It's not fair on you.

And silent treatment for days is bullshit too.
Find an adult to date."
597,"She's not stupid. She's just, really, really naive. We grew up in a tiny ass town, where people didn't really lie too much, at least not big ones. Everyone knew everyone's business so you wouldn't get away with it anyway. I think she may just not have realized yet that not everywhere is like back home."
598,"No. Nope. No. There is no ""fixing"" this.

Your WIFE who you love and chose to marry was assaulted by this woman who then wished DEATH on your DAUGHTER. 

if she was a stranger you would have had her arrested and charges pressed.

If you push this you risk destroying your marriage and making your wife hate you for putting your child in unnecessary danger.

Send her a cease and desist letter by certified mail. Make sure your family understands you want no contact with her ever again. Let her know in the certified letter that you will seek a restraining order and press charges for harrassment if she keeps trying to contact you or your family.

IT IS YOUR JOB TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER, NOT YOUR BAT SHIT INSANE SISTERS FEELINGS.

What's to stop her from kicking your toddler or running her down in the drive way? She's already wished her dead one and physically attacked your wife and your mother.

Do what's best for your family. Not her."
599,"I hate to say it, but either you come to an agreement, or you separate.

You are not wrong to not want to go through infertility treatment. It's your body after all, so you get to make that decision.

But he is also not wrong to want a biological child.

It's not that one of you is wrong, it's that you have different ideas on how to proceed in the face of infertility.  And with kids, there's no having a 1/2 kid.  You can't do 1/2 IVF, 1/2 adoption.  So if you cannot reach an agreement, or decide to just not have kids, there is no future for you two.

First stop, I think, is a counselor who specializes in infertility.  Maybe both of you having a neutral third party to talk to about infertility and alternate ways to have a family can help one or both of you change your opinion."
600,"This situation is very unusual. You're 21 with a baby, living in an RV, your husband is gone most of the time--that all sounds very stressful. He doesn't want you to go on a trip that your friend will pay for and his own mother will watch the kid? Your husband is an asshole. He has no right to care if you go on this trip, especially because he's never home. It won't affect him one bit for you to go, he's just being selfish."
601,"A 33 year old grown ass man should not feel comfortable blaming his 23 year old partner for a joint decision. 

You guys made decisions together and he needs to own his part in the process especially considering he has 10 years more life experience. If he has buyers remorse he needs to digest those feelings in a constructive way.

Blaming your partner demonstrates a concerning lack of emotional maturity. That’s really some weak sauce bullshit.. 

What he’s saying is he can’t be held accountable.

That isn’t how adulthood works."
602,"You've set a very reasonable boundary and he has made it clear that he will not respect it. That means he is not willing to be loyal to you or your relationship on mutually understood terms. He may not be physically cheating on you, but he certainly isn't being loyal either. You need to seriously consider if that's the kind of person you want to have a family with."
603,"You mention compatible kinks including shibari. This kind of kink involves a very large amount of trust, as you know. You also mention that when you came back from deployment, you ""weren't the best to her"". It could simply be she no longer trusts you enough to open up to you for sex, but perhaps doesn't realise it, or have the energy to deal with it. 

She does, to some extent, sound depressed, but sometimes depression is situational and will pass with time and changing circumstances rather than medications. Likewise libido can ebb and flow through life and that is perfectly normal.

It's hard to offer advice but definitely don't go down the poly route - it won't solve underlying issues in a relationship and can make them much worse. Maybe try to instigate date nights together where sex isn't on the table but intimate touch such as cuddling or massage is. I know it's not the same but it can help you feel more connected while you work on what's wrong."
604,"I hope you don't take this the wrong way, OP ... but why is an au pair the first place you went to for child care options?

There's a whole bevy of options to consider: part-time or full-time daycare, a nanny share, trading babysitting time with other mommies, etc. Why does the solution have to be an au pair? 

The other thing that needs to be noted, OP, is this: you can't blame your wife for feeling insecure when your boredom/low-grade discontent is dripping from each word in this post. Her reservations are not springing fully formed from nowhere. Your discontent is the environment from which her insecurity grows, so you need to focus on what you can change (your discontent) as well as work on supporting your wife. 

The only way to fight her insecurity is to face what is making her insecure head-on; your lack of emotional support needs to be addressed first and foremost."
605,This dude sounds SO fucking gross to me.
606,"The problem with this post does not lie with your expectations - it's about the way your boyfriend speaks to you. You were not out of line at ALL, but the way he talked to you was. How long have you been together? Is this familiar behavior?"
607,At first I was on her side because I get the feeling and many of have been there. But her lack of professionalism here is probably part of the reason she likely was overlooked for this position. She is far more interested in the position than she is in how much these changes are benefitting her and her coworkers.
608,"Question... is your mom seeing a therapist? I would maybe consider getting ahold of the therapist to tell them this info and ask, if they feel comfortable sharing, if it's a good idea or how to share with your mom. Maybe they could just say no it's not a good idea now or something. I don't know"
609,"As a former 14-year-old girl, I would suggest that you avoid the phrase “I’ll get in trouble”, as that could telegraph to her that you *wish* you could flirt with her/be with her, but you’re afraid of getting in trouble or losing your job, so she’d better start helping you get sneaky about meeting up with her."
610,"Y’all were in the same place and you didn’t just say to her “hey whats up, I wanted to hang tonight but I thought you were busy” and instead you are in here asking what’s going on?

Christ just.... break up already if you can’t talk to each other. It could be anything from she’s fading out the relationship to, she was going to chill and then her friend called and she got persuaded to anything at all but if you don’t ask you’ll never know!"
611,"I’d rather poke out my eyes than ever ask or take money from my kids. 

Tell your brother to piss off."
612,"I personally am seeing two separate issues that are being conflated.

**The first issue** is that you feel your girlfriend does not respect your time. Based on your post, I'm going to guess she frequently either flakes or reschedules plans. In your example, it went from her making plans to come over, then turned into she won't have enough time but she still wants to see you so now she expects YOU to come to her. Maybe once every blue moon it's fine to accommodate those last minute changes, but if it happens regularly then I can definitely see how it would frustrate you and make you feel disrespected. After all, she created these plans and now she suddenly changes them and expects you to fix it because of HER poor time management? Not cool (if it occurs often).

That alone warrants its OWN conversation, a time where you can say something like, ""I feel like you don't respect my time. I acknowledge that you work HARD and you work a lot, and I understand that the day can get away from you without realizing. However, I don't like that our plans change so frequently, and it feels like the onus is on ME to resolve the scheduling conflict. I would really appreciate if you could try harder to commit to our plans, it would make me feel respected and loved.""

**The second issue** I see is that you don't handle your disappointment well and it bleeds heavily into your communication. She isn't wrong when she says you bail. After all, disengaging and removing yourself from the situation IS bailing. It's also incredibly rude and immature to hang up on someone when you become frustrated. I'm going to guess that she either tries calling you back which you then ignore, or she sends you a bunch of texts that you ignore. That's strictly based on assumption (because you mentioned silence), but if you do, that's called stonewalling and is actually really damaging to relationships as well.

Here's my recommendation: instead of shutting down a conversation by hanging up or just saying ""I can't deal with this now!"" and ignoring her, I think it's fair to disengage *with a timeline*. Someone else mentioned a great comment: ""Hey, we're both emotional right now and I'm afraid I'm going to start shutting down, so let's take a 30 minute break and I'll call you back. I really need to chill out for a bit"". She needs to respect your need to cool down before getting back into an argument. After all, what good does it do to have angry fights when you can have calm collected ones with results?

So I think you should have the FIRST ISSUE conversation first, bring up your frustration using ""I"" statements. Let her know that frequent changes of plans starts to make you feel like your time and feelings don't matter. Then tell her how you'd like to stick to plans. I'd also bring up that you recognize how hurtful it is to shut down and hang up and refuse addressing issues immediately, so you'll be trying a new approach to how you argue."
613,"Can you tell us what he actually brings to your relationship?? Based on this post, and your post history:

- seemingly has never thought about marriage with you despite you moving states for him

- is addicted to video games

- doesn't clean at all despite barely working
(BTW, I'm wondering if those issues from your last posts have been resolved) 

Are you happy in this relationship? Has he done anything or sacrificed anything for this relationship specifically? Or is the relationship mostly on HIS terms? 

By 26, he should be able to have adult conversations with you and provide the adult relationship you're clearly craving, but I'm not sure he will or even wants to."
614,"Be a untied front with your good roommate and tell her, don't ask her, to start making new living arrangements. If she's on the lease you have to be prepared for her to refuse. In that case you and good  roommate may have to be the ones that leave. 

There is no nice way to do this. You have to be honest and direct or nothing will happen."
615,"""Why should we lose our home?""

If your mother sold you that home, she would still view it as hers. However, as the property owner, you would be legally responsible for it. That sounds like a fucking nightmare."
616,"This is like, textbook emotional abuse. He's cruel to you and spins it so it's your fault that he's cruel to you, and on top of that gaslights you into thinking your desire for openness and communication is abnormal. He's manipulating you. Seriously, he sucks and is unlikely to change and you deserve better."
617,"Yeah, the problem with compulsive lying is... you have to keep up with your lie. You actually have to be really smart and have insane memory to keep up the lie and not contradict yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully compulsive liars arent always that smart, so eventually they mess up."
618,"Frankly, from an outsider POV I find her actions very suspect. Even the PI says she doesn't apply herself. I think you should bring this up to him since you're having a moral dilemma. You're basically letting him do his job.

I also sense that you feel guilty because you know she's in the wrong but is having trouble believing that she'd act so slick towards you. She's been a student for how long?? The rules of plagiarism have not changed."
619,"Even at 29, I prefer “Partner” to “Boyfriend” because it just feels much more comfortable."
620,Unless he did that specifically for the picture.
621,"Right? The cousin is only 18! Golly, 18 years and no relationship? Is he gay?! Is he even human?! I would’ve reacted the same way as OP’s husband."
622,"Even if she hasn't done anything physical yet, that's still cheating. Sexting is still cheating, period. You're not overreacting. It seems she has very low self-control, or she just doesn't care."
623,"I was literally expecting OP to say that she broke up with him so I'm just as confused on why she's still trying to find ways to fix it. Like girl, leave his ass! She sounds scared to end it officially or something 🤦🏾"
624,"This really does speak to me. I know my wife's relationship with her parents is good, but she definitely isn't afraid to be blunt with them (and they aren't with her either) which has been weird to watch. My dad actually doesn't yell at her, but he gets really angry at strangers for dumb things which makes her embarrassed and me as well. I know they are weird and not pleasant people and I'm still trying to figure it out."
625,"Throw this whole shit away.

Why would you want to live with a grown baby?! You are not his maid and should not have to do all the shit you do... paid or unpaid.

I would run."
626,"If you got a great deal on it, it’s possible you could flip it for a profit, but I doubt it’s about the house.  I’m guessing your husband is feeling anxious in general.

Perhaps it would help to remind him that most people don’t stay in their homes for 30 years any longer, and offer a compromise of looking for a new home in 5?"
627,"All the people pointing out the break up over text thing clearly did not read the original post that pointed out your ex's extreme rage and screaming over video games. If someone is slamming their bed frame and screaming at the top of their lungs over a fucking video game, I'd break up via text too. I would be too terrified that rage would turn on me. Especially since said ex is drinking like an alcoholic.

I am glad that didn't happen with you OP but after the break up text, you shouldn't have pushed for responses from him. It only needs one person to want to break up in a relationship. Good luck moving forward from this."
628," Talk to her about it and ask if it has come up before.    I can't imagine working with an adult thumb sucker.  Most parents to an end to that in toddler-hood.  Often times, they use a bitter tasting nail polish to make it yucky."
629,"&gt;I know that this is the mature way to approach this and I should believe that he loves me and that I should be grateful he wants to make our relationship better.

Why do you think this?? How do you know this? I keep seeing post after post from young women in their prime accepting all sorts of f!ckery and nonsense from knob-ends of men - WHY is this happening, did someone release a subliminal code onto the interwebs that has brainwashed an entire generation of women to feel grateful for dribs and dabs of negative attention from men or something?? Do you really not know...that at 26 you have your pick of men?

and hunnie you live in the UK, you have way more freedom than most women worldwide as far as men are concerned. Nobody is forcing you to stay with or marry this dude. You don't have to sit fretting and sad over some raggedy bum who has *hassled you over 7 pounds* when you stayed with him and comforted him when he wouldn't even wash his ass for 8 days. Yah ok he was sick from the crazy and whatever else, but funny how he couldn't extend a bit of compassion and understanding when YOU were sick. You've been there for him for 3 years of his sickness, but he couldn't do the same for you for a mere month of yours. You had to be hospitalized for a whole week!! And this madafaka had the nerve to complain about how your body looked as a result and go in on you about 'getting your life together' and called you lazy and unambitious even though you spend your money on him DA FUQ?

and now you're posting on reddit wanting to save the relationship with this man, what in the world? The mind boggles"
630,"Him saying stuff like “I don’t know why I’m with you”, “nobody else would have stayed” *is* cruel and abusive. I don’t know what it is about this sub and dehumanizing people with mental illnesses, but you are still talking about a *person* with *feelings*. Just because you don’t like their mental illness doesn’t give you a free pass to treat them like garbage. Just because you understand his feelings about if she relapses doesn’t mean he’s right. If that’s the way he feels, staying with her knowing that if things get tough, he’s just gonna dip, then he should leave and let her find someone who does want to get married and have children, and won’t leave her when things get tough. It’s entirely possible she’ll relapse at least once, that’s just a fact of life. But it must really suck to hear that from someone you thought cared enough about you to stay. It’s not cruel to not want kids with someone, but to stay with someone and manipulate someone to stay with you that you do not want kids with, is cruel."
631,"I have never understood this about people in long term relationships that don't want to get married. Nothing changes but you are awarded certain ""perks"". Namely, next of kin, emergency contacts, and tax breaks. I think most people don't want the pageant of a wedding."
632,Why are you together? Seriously...why?
633,"Hormonal imbalance

Google PMDD, some people's bodies do this typically and it's more of a gland thing and less of psych thing.

Good to rule out a mechanical/biological cause at the very least."
634,"He's got an online persona to uphold.
The internet can really eat away at your self-esteem, especially if you're surrounded by ""seemingly"" successful people online.
He's already fabricsted parts of his life online and he's trying to uphold that image by throwing an elaborate party to showcase his so called ""wealth"" and ""success""

I know you probably have a great kid, but honestly, the need for approval and validation by his so called ""internet buddies"" is toxic af."
635,It’s sweet that he doesn’t though. That it wouldn’t even occur is a good sign.
636,"It may be that they manage better than expected. My grandmother sounds very much like OP's in laws (to the extent she doesn't eat pasta because ""its not her culture"") but she also travels abroad and happily eats the food she is served there, even if it is not at all what she is used to. It's like she just clicks out of picky mode when she travels. I think for a lot of people who eat like that, it's not really about the taste, it's about the comfort of eating the same thing as always, the ""right"" thing for their culture and so on. So, when outside of that environment they actually do better than you'd think because they can change to travelling mindset."
637,Right so I will say this: they are adults and can make food choices for themselves. It is not your responsibility at all in any way shape or form. The only thing I will say is to stress there is little western food in Korea and to let them sort themselves out accordingly. The only people going to be spoiling their trip to Korea is themselves.
638,Definitely talk to your PI. You don't want her to claim ownership and accuse you of plagiarism down the line. Did she cited you as the original author on her poster? That would be okay.
639,"Maybe he's in love with you.

You need to confront him about this and you need to start making plans to end this friendship and live somewhere else.  I know that's going to be difficult, but the situation you describe is massively disrespectful at best and horror-movie creepy at worst."
640,I am very much team this.
641,"Seriously this. Do not share any regular ole pics of your kids with your sister. Who knows what this creep will do with them. This might mean unfriending her on social media and restricting what you share with other family members.

Kudos to your wife and her 6th sense!"
642,"Never stay with someone out of fear of being alone. He sounds like a douche and you’ll be alright, I promise. Did your friends say they don’t want to stay in touch or have you alienated them for your boyfriend? Reach out to them!"
643,"Also, if I were in your situation, me &amp; bf would avoid her like the plague. Her behavior might escalate. When you are at your bf's flat, stay inside his room as much as possible. And when she's around or tries to spend time with you guys, like glare at you while you're in the kitchen, try to leave the area and go in his room as soon as you can. Have very little interaction with her. And most importantly, your bf's behavior towards her should be consistent whether you're there or not."
644,"I'm sorry, but if someone flips up my wife's skirt and touches her underwear he is probably getting a knuckle sandwich.  No apologies for it.  Not having been there for the dog incident I can say how bad that was.  I would have pulled the dog back under control and given the ""bad dog"" verbal correction but wouldn't have hit it.  Hitting animals is not productive.  I do not agree that either of these incidents mean he will abuse you in the future.  That said, keep your eye on him.  The first sign of aggressiveness he shows toward you, then you should run."
645,"I'm sorry OP, but this is bad news. I speak from experience. I had an ex who was hardcore evangelical wait-till-marriage kind of guy. We did it more than once (outside of marriage of course) and even though he always initiated it, he'd give me the silent treatment afterwards, angry at himself and at me for ""seducing him"". If your bf can't take responsibility for his own desires, then what else will he refuse to take responsibility for? What else will he blame you for to let himself off the hook?"
646,"&gt;Am I doing a crappy job at respecting my boyfriends convictions?

No, he's doing a crappy job of respecting his convictions and isn't taking responsibility for his part in going against them. It's not like you're in any way coercing or manipulating him into having sex with you, so why is it your fault that he couldn't keep it in his pants? And several times, at that! You're doing the right thing in being safe, though frankly I don't know why you'd want to continue sleeping with someone who blames you for his own actions. Talk about a mood-killer."
647,"If she wants to make herself useful, have her volunteer. There's plenty of options there. Buying a business to offset boredom is a terrible idea."
648,"I think it's also quite telling that she is being incredibly apologetic and begging for forgiveness and to be taken back, very much seeming to agree she is in the wrong, while the friends are spamming him with abuse and making him out to be unreasonable. Whatever we think of her behaviour, those friends are not acting at all in her interest."
649,"Everyone has done a good job of discussing the other elements of your post, but I want to point out that if you're looking for a very affectionate pet, a Pyr (or any other livestock guardian breed) is really not a good choice. The puppy may well be cuddly now, but LGDs are bred to be independent and reserved. 

I get that the puppy is sort of beside the point here, and that making a big decision like getting a puppy while in the middle of emotional turmoil is a bad idea. But since OP is really fixated on this puppy, I wanted to also point out that, everything else aside, this is probably the wrong puppy anyway."
650,"A man whose reaction to sexual assault of anyone but particularly his female partner is to escalate it to violence especially without even checking in with her first is not a man who can safely contain his temper. 

And as a survivor of multiple sexual assaults the people who made my assaults about their feelings and reactions over mine were a red flag I should never have ignored.

The appropriate reaction to sexual assault is to make sure the person being assaulted feels safest and most in control. Some survivors do find it validating to have someone physically stand up for them but many find two men attacking each other and escalating the situation incredibly traumatising and makes the situation worse.

There are usually better ways to handle a sexual assault than introducing violence to the situation and frankly I need no more toxic masculinity in that situation. 

Don’t punch some guy’s lights out and justify it by defending my honour and make me responsible for your actions. Then I’ve got one man blaming me for his perviness and one blaming me for his rage and neither of them managing their own damned behaviour."
651,"If she's one of the faces of your barn then **IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH HER**, but it's also pretty clear from your post that you avoid **ANYTHING** that even remotely resembles conflict like the plague.    Which also includes managing and teaching.     

Basically you've created this situation for yourself, and now you are looking for some ""good as gold"" so that you can get through this situation.   

When you let her go just tell her that you are scaling back operations and her position is being eliminated.   You can't talk about you other employee with her, so if she asks about the other employee, just tell her the conversation is about her, not the other employee, and you are not at liberty to discuss the status for other employees."
652,"Are you sure? Because in your post you say she has told you about things they have done when they waited until you were out of the room. It's entirely possible they're jerks to her right under your nose as well and you just don't see it because you're used to it, ""that's just how they are"" and have spent your whole life thinking it's normal. 

Maybe spend some time considering how you would feel if two strangers or two friends treated you the way your parents treat you or treat your wife. I suspect you'll find, if you're honest about the things they say and do, that you wouldn't put up with their behaviors from strangers or friends, but you expect your wife to put up with it from your parents."
653,"This sounds like a good idea. 

Explain how you're feeling, especially about your legal place in his life, and how his father's mortality has made you think about it."
654,"My best friend is Male, I am female. We never fell asleep on a bed together, we fell asleep on a couch together a couple times. We were both single at the time. It was innocent and nothing ever came of it.

We lived together while both dating what would turn out to be the people we would marry. We never fell asleep on the couch together while dating other people. Even though we both knew it was innocent, we both knew it was over stepping a line that would make our respective SO's uncomfortable. 

I guess it's up to you. You could mention to him that you trust him, but sleeping in the same bed with this friend is a deal breaker in the future for you. I think most people would not have to be told this, but I did have another friend that use to have sleep overs with his female best friend all the time, and nothing ever happened. For me personally, that is too personal, and I wouldn't want an SO doing that."
655,"I think your imagination is running wild and you're thinking of all these what ifs. It sounds like your relationship is a good one, I mean you didn't focus or say one negative thing about it. I would honestly cut ties with ex, it's keeping old feelings lingering that shouldn't be.

The fact you've always been a listening ear has definitely not help disconnect the 2 of you. I'm surprise your wife is OK with this. Cut ties and work on your marriage if it's not going well than take the next step of attempting to fix it or break it off but your ex isn't an option any way you look at it."
656,Top MBA programs all expect you to have work experience before enrolling.
657,They won’t eat chicken on the bone? They don’t have roast chicken in England? They can’t use a knife and fork to cut it off the bone?
658,He doesn't consent to sex. That's his right. For any reason.
659,"Well first of all he should’ve had better control over his dog, when I pass strangers especially someone with a stroller I keep my dog on a very short leash. But that’s not the point, yeah you should definitely break up with him, and be careful about it because you don’t know if he will react physically. This is not normal behavior, it’s never ok to hit a dog (unless it’s like, attacking you)."
660,"So, the whole point of dating (not just hooking up, but serious dating like you’re doing with this guy), is to find out more about a person, who they are/their good points and bad points, etc, and then decide if that’s who you might want to be with long-term. 

This is who he is. Is that what you want long-term?"
661,"This is not a bullshit law. This law SAVES LIVES. You need to wrap your head around this. She is abusing you, whether you like it or not. Her, or her family, being mad at you makes no difference. These laws are to protect people who refuse to protect themselves. She needs help. You need help."
662,"Yep, this is not your problem. I’m sure they’ll figure something out. Rice and crackers."
663,"Also a guy.

The reason they encounter those guys is that they go out more. They sound like pursue men more aggressively than you do. You have your own interests, hobbies, and passions. These girls like to say things like ""we'll all have boyfriends"" as though it means membership of a club as opposed to choosing a partner whom you love and respect.

From this information, I second the motion you sound more dateable than they do. Don't let them make you feel weird for not having vapid and generic priorities.

As Guy #1 said: can't speak to the truth of it, but their reasoning is nonsense."
664,"That's what I'm thinking. It's not like she was my best friend or anything.. just a bad encounter offline, I guess."
665,"The question to be asking here is the obvious one. *Why?* Why, when you have great prospects already and a good outlook, does she insist on you getting more education or plunging into riskier waters? Why does someone who's only been with you for five months think she has a place to dictate what you do with your life? It's not enough to say what she wants for you, it's on her to justify it. She needs to do a lot more talking and a lot less expecting."
666,Right?  This girl publishes.
667,"&gt; before she escalates it and gets him kicked out or worse.

She's a psycho.  When she realizes she can't ""bag the buck"" she'll go all out to destroy him.  Incoming false sexual harassment/assault claim in 3...2...1.."
668,all of that totally happened
669,Yea she’s 40 FFS and she’s giving him the silent treatment?
670,"Yep, this. As the DM it is *OP’s job* to make sure his players are having fun, understand what’s happening, and everyone gets a chance to play. There are definitely situations in which the player can be an issue, but this isn’t one of them. 

Sit the new player closer to the DM. Pay special attention to him, and make sure he’s picking up the rules. See that he understands why each person is doing specific things with their character “I.e she is making an attack role now, she receives a bonus to her due to [skill]”. If he doesn’t understand the rules, it’s your job to teach him."
671,"You've been dating this guy for 4 months, there is no reason on earth for you to put up with this.  This is sexual assault.  You have told him no and he ignores you.  He is a bad person.  You should stop seeing him.  You should call the police if he continues."
672,"Yeah this post is ridiculous. 

OP, you're being ridiculous. Stop talking to him. Block him on electronics and ignore him in person. Report him if he keeps harassing you in a professional setting. If I were your current boyfriend I'd seriously consider dumping your ass because you seem obsessed with coddling and ""managing"" your ex. Reality check, what happens with this man child is none of your problem or responsibility and you should stop worrying about what happens to him, full stop. Like you just wrote 7 paragraphs about him for Christ's sake. Grow a backbone and put an end to this nonsense."
673,"This. It shows that you are serious about you not being the instigator. 

And make it your mission to as in keep bugging him until you are moved to a different floor."
674,"Your comment is I think currently the only one here to point out the age gap and its implications on their respective behavior and their relationship.

F23 and M33, married with second baby on the way. OP, if you don't mind my asking, how old were you when you got together?"
675,"Both are tough choices. Both are also expensive and not guaranteed. 


Before you do either, I would suggest couples counseling to discuss what each means to you, also what happens if they don't work, at what point would you two stop trying (for adopting or fertility treatments).  


What are the requirements of each, and can you two handle them?  Fertility treatments take a huge toll on a woman' body and mental health.  Are you prepared? Is he prepared to support?  


Adoption - I know of people who ended up moving to that country as it took 2-3 years to get it done.  And more and more countries are making it harder for Americans to adopt (presuming you're American).  


Source: I have a friend who did fertility treatment 2-3x.  I have a friend who moved overseas to adopt her kid. 

Strongly recommend couples counseling."
676,"He has a job right? Ask him if he half asses hus job like this. If he litters all over the floor at work and leaves it for someone else. If he makes his lunch in the break room and then leaves his dirty dishes for someone else to deal with. 

If he is a slob all the time, maybe you can work on better habits. 

If he keeps his workspace neat, then he somehow doesn't think picking up his home is his job. And obviously is expecting it to be done for him."
677,"All of the above, plus I recommend reading The Gift of Fear if you haven't already, OP"
678,"This is some Single White Female type of bullshit. I wouldn't just blow it off and call it little. This chick sounds totally cray cray. 

Definitely document, definitely report."
679,"Maybe find a new neurologist. My seizure specialist is a pretty awesome guy (the neurologist before him wasn't). 


But your boyfriend won't talk to your GP? And it's too hot/cold to go for walks with you? It sounds like, in theory, he cares about your safety, but he's not making any effort to help mitigate risks other than ""stop doing things you enjoy""."
680,"Yea, they've been together for 7+ years, this is who he is. OP needs to decide whether this is a dealbreaker or not (and frankly I think it should be) but he's not going to change. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If he’s this traditional why is he allowing you to pay for his training? 

Exactly. I think he's using the ""I'm traditional"" BS as an excuse to be lazy."
681,"To be honest, I would be surprised if most mothers haven't felt this way at some time or another. 
A lot of parenting is plain old drudgery no matter which way you dress it up, and whether your husband and kids help out or not doesn't change the fact that mums get stuck with a lot of the load.

Its lucky we do love them, I reckon we all would have run away otherwise."
682,Dafuq? 40? Missed that. Ugh.
683,"No you're not doing something wrong. Your husband is just selfish and entitled. And FYI, a partner coming up to me and just rubbing my clit while I try to cook dinner is going to do absolutely zero to turn me on."
684,Does she even have a cat?
685,"Me too. OP, don’t JADE (justify, defend, argue, or explain), reasons are for reasonable people."
686,His wife...who seems to have no issue with marrying a Tier 2 sex offender and allowing said sex offender around children. Ugh. Disgusting.
687,"Everybody asking this, it’s not like OP can do anything about it. It’s completely irrelevant in the realm of things _he_ can do... it’s not like he made up the rules for that family. The only thing he controls is how he acts or reacts to the current situation."
