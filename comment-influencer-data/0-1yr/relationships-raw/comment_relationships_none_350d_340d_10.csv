1,"&gt;I still haven’t left him

&gt;Long story short I’m still with him.

Let's adjust your perception here.

You did break up with him.

In response, he imprisoned you in his house.

You had to play along for your safety.

That doesn't mean you didn't break up with him. You did. He didn't take no for an answer. That doesn't mean **anything**. You're not still with him. You merely pretended like you were still with him because you were taken hostage. You don't need his approval to break up with him, break ups don't work that way.

You are in an abusive relationship, and your judgement is extremely clouded. You should find a way to cut all contact with him **immediately** and find a secure place until all this gets resolved. You may need to get a restraining order against him and have what happened in record. You are in danger. Maybe you don't realize but you are in *real* danger. Locking the doors to keep you from leaving the house is **not** normal behaviour. It is abusive, and it is a crime. You were imprisoned against your will. Despite what you might have been led to believe, this is not something done out of ""love"". This is not something a sane partner does to their other half. You need to leave immediately. Don't go to his house ever again, and don't let him into your house either. **Under no circumstances you can be alone with him ever again.** You can get imprisoned (by him, again), beaten, raped or worse. Thousands of women get harmed or killed each year by people just like your ex. Please understand the severity of the situation and please take the appropriate measures to protect yourself."
2,"Your boyfriend is a baby. Why are you scheduling his doctors appointments and buying his cigarettes (he shouldn't be smoking or eating anything beyond something simple for breakfast if he has 'crippling stomach pain' btw) and generally supporting him? Calling you 30 times to beg you to stay home from work on your second day is... abusive. He is manipulative, immature, and you REALLY absolutely need to break up. "
3,"Dump him by text or phone, lock your doors and dump his stuff outside. If he comes over and kicks off,  call the police. Do not go to his again!"
4,"You're in an abusive relationship. That is why the relationship has felt bad and toxic. This is why he wants to stay with you even thought he calls you terrible names. 

A common feature of abusive relationships is the abuser escalates when the victim tries to leave the relationship. He escalated yesterday - he held you hostage in his home and abused you until you agreed to stay with him. 

This is really concerning behaviour. You need to end this relationship and get away from him. Please reach out to your friends and family for support, and read the book 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft. He might escalate further into threats of violence and stalking when he realises you are serious about not being with him and you need to have your friends/family there for you. "
5,I have a sneaking suspicion that grad school is his dream because it delays his entry into the real world for another 3-4 years. He can’t imagine himself landing a job now so a PhD will magically open doors for him. Emphasis on magic since he doesn’t even have the starting tools to enter a PhD program.
6,"Your wife is going to live the next several years to possibly decades dealing with this terrible woman, and all because she feels guilty? That’s what abuse does. She’s feeding into the cycle. Your wife needs to break it. The fact that she feels it’s her responsibility to give up her happiness for the sake of family is super unhealthy and I’d worry about how that’s going to impact any children you have. Your wife needs to be able to set healthy standards, because people that don’t often end up showing signs of being negligent and abusive, even if they are the sweetest people otherwise. 

Go to couples therapy. Ask your wife to go to therapy on her own too. "
7,"Wow, what a ride.

Look, there's an easy answer here.  Tell your siblings that you won't stand in the way of them having whatever kind of relationship they want with your other sister.  After all, they're adults and you don't get to control them.  But the other side of that coin is this - you don't want to go, you don't want to talk to her, and you don't want to talk about her.  You aren't ready and aren't sure when or if you ever will be, and that's all you have to say.  There, done, and with a bow on it.

As for you, I think you need to see a professional about unpacking your childhood.  The unique abuse you suffered, and your siblings were spared, is going to shade all your judgements and actions.  I noticed in your post that whenever the negative side of your childhood rears its head, you freak out, lose all emotional control, and become inconsolable / irrationally angry.  That's no way to live your life man, you're out of control and it's never going to go away on its own - nevermind looking like a crazy person to everyone else.  I think, at a minimum, you need to see a therapist for a good long while, focusing on your childhood and family, before you talk to your other sister.  She's going to trigger you, there's no way around it, so prepare and heal yourself before you do or say something you'll regret."
8,"Simple solution - tell your in laws that if they're keeping the money you'll be sure to point that out to everyone who tried to give you any. Your thank you letters can be ""thank you for your gift, unfortunately it was ~~taken~~ (edit) **stolen** from us by my parents /in-laws so we can't make use of it, but appreciate the thought"". Either the threat of public shame will make them return it, or else you get the satisfaction of outing their shittiness for everyone to see."
9,"&gt; The first thing my bf said to my friend's bf was ""You finally caved?"", to which my friend's bf replied ""What are you talking about? I WANT to get married.""

Well isn’t THAT revealing. 

Good for you. No point dragging this out a moment longer. You know exactly where he stands. "
10,"Sounds like she has some personal problems that she's projecting onto you. Your wedding day is supposed to be about you and your partner, not about someone else- comparing days is like apples and oranges. Hers might suit her better as a cute country wedding, yours might be intimate and modern. Who cares? It's not a competition. You might try telling her something like that, and bring up the idea of a wedding planner- they can give her a beautiful, brilliant, personal wedding and will know all the tips and tricks to have a day that is perfect and needs no comparison."
11,"You can refuse to take her. No medical facility can force an unsafe discharge. Perhaps she becomes a ward of the state, and loses her assets."
12,"Man, he sounds pretty depressed. Maybe help get him into therapy, and set a deadline with him to move out? Seems like a fair compromise with your husband?"
13,"Send him a quick email that states first how pleased you are with his work performance and give a short specific example. Thank him for stepping up under the circumstances. 








Then just confirm that you are happy the company can let him work from home and to let you know if he needs any resources or has questions while getting used to the option. Maybe mention how you enjoy working from home every once in a while? 








Just letting him know he has your support and approval will help a lot. "
14,"First step is to stop allowing Leah's parents to watch your daughter alone. They might not try to take her, but you never really know. Have your parents babysit your daughter, or hire someone you can trust to watch her while youre at work. Only let Leah's parents see your daughter if you can be there the entire visit, too. 

Next step is to talk to a custody lawyer. Im not a lawyer and dont know if there are any laws in place about something like this. It is best for your to talk to a professional before something happens (if something happens) so you can get a feel for what steps you should take to ensure Leah's parents do not try to take your daughter. (Edit: as far as I am aware on grandparent's rights, they have a right to see her when you allow it, not a right to demand custody). 

I am so sorry youre going through this, OP. I wish you the best of luck that this ends peacefully. "
15,"&gt;I’m having a baby in two months and I told him to either work or gtfo so I can sell the house and move in with family.

It sounds like the meal-prep issue is maybe not the biggest one you are having."
16,"Any relative of mine who did this would be dead to me. They stole from you and your wife and are trying to steal from the venue, as well, by lying about the quality of the service. This is probably the last straw for your wife after a lifetime of this kind of behavior. She probably dealt with a ton of their issues while trying to plan the wedding, since they put in money. It sounds like she's just done. Back her play. Build a wonderful life together. Appreciate the people who treat you with respect and kindness."
17,"Drinking wine with dinner isn't weird.

Stashing a box of wine under the table so you can fill your glass while you eat is weird."
18,Talk to a lawyer. He will have an obligation to help financially support the kids.
19,"You need to go to the professor or to your adviser. He's doing it to you, he could be doing it to other women. "
20,"Say no. What if your MIL lives another decade or two and refuses to divorce? By taking this woman in, your wife is committing you, and your children until they flee from home as soon as they can, to living in a toxic environment for potentially 20+ years. This will ruin your marriage. There’s no way around it. 

Get her an attorney who will sit down with her and explain her options — options that don’t include being “saved” again by a daughter she’s abused for her entire life. "
21,"I’m gonna be honest, I laughed when I read the subject line. It’s a little hilarious that when confronted about his behavior he proceeds to throw the kind of tantrum a 4 year old would throw. 

Then I read the body and it’s not funny anymore. 

You’re just asking for permission to break up with him, right? Because permission granted! He’s deffo gonna pull some squatters rights bs on you. "
22,I think that you should let her “copy you” by bringing up “your idea” to use a wedding planner instead of planning it yourself rather than doing the work for her. Then you can give her the name of “your planner” (who you have researched) on accident. Or whatever. She seems immature so I think an immature solution would work best if you choose to continue your relationship with her. 
23,"1) put a note on the inside of the door.

2) get a lock that auto-locks. ie, once shut you need the key to get in from the outside."
24,The fact that they told you that you were unfit to parent after losing your Girlfriend and the mother of your child in such a short time is disgusting. That’s so selfish and unsympathetic. I’m so sorry. My personal guess is that they are saddened by their daughters loss and are using the baby as a way to cope or so. You are her father and sound like a fantastic one. You need to stand your ground with this and contact a custody lawyer. I wish you the best of luck.
25,"Hey, I feel like I might have a useful perspective here, because I’ve basically been this girl. I’ve had a couple relationships with much older men: one that was fine and one that was very much NOT fine.

The one that was bad was made worse by the fact that the man encouraged me not to tell my parents about it. So take it as a good sign that your daughter feels she can talk to you! The relationship I had that was healthy (but inevitably ended) was one that my parents were fully aware of. They met him, they talked to me about what was going on, and therefore anything suspicious could have been addressed.

I know that the idea of a 57 year old man dating your daughter might make you sick, but the best thing you can do is keep an open line of communication with her. Don’t villainize the relationship because then she’ll only pull further away and be more susceptible to abuse. She’ll figure out eventually that this is not what she wants.

Also! Check the university policies. He may need to disclose that he’s dating a student at the school (even if she’s not his student.) things get much more complicated when power dynamics are involved and you should talk to your daughter about how those can be abused. "
26,"The stalking thing worries me. He has always told me he gets very attached to the people he dates and that he always gets his heart broken - makes me wonder if this is how he always behaves, he seems obsessive.

I will definitely get that book, thanks for recommending it and thank you for your advice "
27,"Tell them you just broke up with your abusive boyfriend.  And mean it.

Edit: ...and call the cops, and get somewhere safe, and never, never stay with someone who hurts you. Also, it's perfectly reasonable to take a day off work after this. Take care of yourself!"
28,"That’s abusive behavior, every comment is gonna tell you to leave him."
29,"&gt; Since i began being interested in woman, i've faced 3 rejections, 1 bad date, and then that. Nothing positive. I feel like i'm doomed, i can't handle it anymore. 

With all due respect, stop being so dramatic. 

You've had four bad experiences. Four. Say it out loud. Put aside the rejections and you've had just one date. One.

You're absolutely not doomed, you just need more experience. I wallowed in self pity for years, and wasted my opportunities to develop until my early twenties. Even then, it took a few years until I became comfortable with dating and gained the self-confidence to be the one breaking things off when they weren't right.

Just stick at it, and don't let yourself spiral like this. You're going to go through the exact same experience tens of millions of other people do, and you'll do fine. Trust me."
30,"Challenge her to defend it. Not in a malicious, antagonistic way, but ask her what her proposal is for paying for this. And don't accept ""oh it will be fine"" or ""I'll probably get a raise"" or any other type of non-answer - make her lay out with math that supports her proposal how your current finances can make this feasible. Because if what your wife is really saying is that she's willing to forego all your financial stability including presumably changing your philosophy around retirement and your kids' college, that's a pretty huge break in your agreement. Ask her questions like ""If one of us had a medical or some other emergency, how would you see us paying for that if we had this house cost?"". and ""Are you saying you want to change our plan for the amount we are saving towards retirement and college, and by that do you mean you don't want to retire at _ age and you do not want to support the kids financially through school?""

Beyond that, base your answers on her answers. If her answers to the above are truthfully that yes, she wants to totally change your financial strategy to not have the 'worst' house on the block, I think you should look long and hard at staying in this relationship. It reads to me like she has a 'keeping up with the joneses' issue and is prioritizing optics and looking wealthy over the actual financial wellbeing and stability of her family. 

A caveat - if your house is somehow not habitable, you are dumping money down the drain to maintain it, or it is quickly losing home value for some reason, SOME change probably is in order such as a relocation. But I would bet my next paycheck the right change for you is not to sink yourselves financially just to have a house that looks more like the neighbors'. 

EDIT TO ADD: Oh and beyond just the cost of ownership (ie, mortgage) you should factor in the cost of maintaining and furnishing a much larger home. Whatever you're spending now on landscaping for instance would likely go up, if there are more systems like more bathrooms that's more that can go wrong, and of course more rooms / space = more furniture to buy.
"
31,You two are incompatible- you don't want kids and he... is fucking nuts
32,"This is interesting keep us updated 


She is hiding something. Abrupt change without logic is a sign, then the many excuses for those abrupt changes, another sign. 

Go in and bring her coffee at 1am with flowers since she is working hard and you want to be a good husband 


Edit: more signs"
33,"&gt;I’m shocked he’s taking this all out on me. 

This should be an instant break up from you.  He is not taking responsibility for his temper and that is a very bad sign.

&gt;He keeps saying the other guy provoked him and he felt threatened which is why he pulled out the knife. 

More dodging of responsibility.   This is a giant red flag.

&gt;He then asked if he could dispose of the knife at my house as he is worried the police might get involved!

NO!  "
34,"She's not just giving up her happiness, she's giving up the happiness of her husband and children to satisfy her guilt! Her mother won't even be happy, because people like that are NEVER happy, so we're just looking at one big unhappy home, for what? So the kids can learn all the wrong things? So OP and his wife can slowly become alienated from one another? This could kill a marriage. For what?"
35,"""she wants us to come and visit the community. She claims that her husband has made her realize that she must at least hear us out if she wants to ‘have her sister back’."" 

Sounds like someone in the community wants to marry your younger sister. 

This sounds really sketchy to me. I think if any one of you does decide they want to meet then all three of you should go *and bring friends with you*. There is strength and safety in numbers. Better to be overly cautious than not enough in this situation. 

ETA: And yes, what everyone else is saying - make sure it's in a neutral public location where say something like an attempted kidnapping would be likely to have strangers interfering/plenty of witnesses. Along with bringing lots of friends with you. Never, ever, ever go to the community of course. "
36,At this point do nothing. Let them be disappointed and maintain a clear boundary that they will at no point just be living with you. Consider pre-marital counseling as your partner's reactions here are pretty worrying as he was just a doormat for his parents and you need to learn how to communicate your issues better so you don't wait to raise objections when you have them. 
37,This is all manipulative bullshit. There's no medical emergency or your 27-year-old boyfriend would get his ass to the hospital. He's just manipulating you. It's also really fucking weird. How does he think the bills will be paid if you wind up losing your job??
38,"My end of the line would’ve been the pills. You have a toddler and baby on the way you need to protect. She is not your child. Im sorry her mom has not taught her life skills. You offered her a shelter, food, and all you asked was that she was respectful and stayed in school. She brought drugs into your house. She brought animals into your house. She has absolutely disrespected you both. You need to tell her it’s time to go. "
39,"You don't need his permission to break up. You're in a abusive relationship. He held you hostage and locked you in his house. That is illegal. You've given him his stuff back. You have nothing else tying you together. Break up with him by text and block his number. Don't have him try and convince you to meet up with him. You don't owe him anything. If you do, he will try this bs again."
40,"&gt; Even our daughter cut ties with him when he didn’t go to her wedding. 

Whoa. Why wouldn't he go? Did you intervene at all when this happened? Has your son been to the doctor lately? My first thought is that your son is lazy and you need to kick him out, but not going to his sister's wedding, unless they had a bad relationship, makes me wonder if he is depressed. Maybe anxious, etc. 

The real problem is that your husband wants to keep enabling your son forever, which is unsustainable. Maybe see if he will go to counseling with you to discuss this issue with a third party. "
41,"&gt;Edit: I forgot in the initial post, but yes, I did explain the reason why I had them tied, personal and medical. He didn't care.

So... he basically doesn't care that you could suffer ""SEVERAL complications"" if you get pregnant. 

Dump this trash."
42,"Why are your options to pay $650 or kick out your boyfriend?  It seems to me that the obvious answer here is to tell your parents that you're sorry they decided to stay home for Thanksgiving, and then enjoy the day with your boyfriend.  "
43,"You have outgrown him.

 Wasting a life is to do nothing gainful. To refuse to grow, learn, evolve.

You are most certainly not the one wasting your life, you get to remember what you did each day.

You have a wonderful futire ahead of you, please do not allow him to be an anchor holding you back."
44,"""No, I chose my self-worth and innate value over staying with a cheater.""

Every time. EVERY single time, until they either get it or they shut the fuck up.

You should be very proud of yourself. "

This is some vile middle school bullshit right here. G is your friend. You shouldn’t be tolerating immature, jealous bullying threats from your gf. People’s lives have been seriously screwed by pages like this and the fact your gf seems so on board with it is something you should think hard about. "
47,Weren't you tired and asleep at 2am? He's so far out of line that he can't even see the line here. Don't put up with this ridiculous behaviour anymore. 
48,"&gt;During sex he's always talking about his abs and asking what it feels like to be with the hottest guy in our city.

I just burst out laughing at my desk, not at you but at the ridiculousness of this shit. This man is absurd.

Obviously you just need to be honest with him and tell him how his behavior makes you feel. If he's not willing to tone this narcissism down, then you have your answer moving forward."
49,i dont really have any advice for you but i think its extremely thoughtful of you to help him out the way you are. 
50,"I'd blow that shit out of the water and send any screenshots of him flirting with you to anyone who thinks you're a stalker. I might get downvoted because it's the petty reaction and not the mature one, but he's been slandering you to cover his own ass."
51,Honestly? She sounds like an asshole.
52,"&gt;  but not a **self starter**, and not good at working alone or **planning major projects from start to finish**. 

Those are literally the core skills needed for a PhD, in addition to domain specific knowledge. Getting a PhD is a lot more about work ethic, independent work, and project planning, than about smarts. 

Your view of the situation is completely correct. Your BF is delusional.

53,"Where are you located? Where I am (British Columbia), if someone gives two weeks notice and the employer turns around and fires them (which is what it looks like happened to you), the employee can still be entitled to pay in lieu of notice. "

55,"You don't need to punish her.  You need to walk away.

Partners don't seek to hurt their SOs.  This relationship is broken beyond repair.  There is no getting even, only getting away."
56,The bigger question is why are you with a guy who is refusing to do some basic googling about his future?  Maybe he is amazing but at your age shouldn't you be dating an adult instead of a teenager?
57,You and mom should meet with the hospital social worker.  They have resources and will be able to help you guys.  
58,"I’d avoid asking others advice on whether an event is cheating. Cheating is stepping outside the established boundaries of a relationship, so if you feel she did that, then it was cheating. "

61,"Your friend is being a childish asshole and if he wanted to get into the VIP area, he had multiple chances to pay the price to get in. Honestly, this dude has shown his true colors and if you don't want to be friends with him anymore after his actions, I totally get you."
62,"Honestly, my own heart sunk when I read that. If you think you can't continue being only friends with him, you shouldn't. "
63,"What kind of make out sessions are you having where you bruise your lips? Jesus

64,"You aren't a jerk in the sense that it is your body and your choice, but keeping this a secret and the fact that you don't feel you can tell him is a worrying statement about the current and future state of your relationship. "
65,"Speak to your instructor, and ask those other students who have noticed his behavior to speak to the instructor as well, so that s/he is aware of what is going on.  Part of the instructor's job is to ensure a classroom environment in which all of the students can learn effectively, and having one student disrupt another like this is something that the instructor should definitely address.

If speaking to the instructor does not help, go another step up the faculty/administration ladder at a time, and raise the issue again, until someone with both the authority and the will to help you takes action.

Does your school have any sort of official code of student conduct that covers unwanted advances?  "
66,Son probably didn't go because he was ashamed of himself. Makes me think he's aware of all the weight he gained and how his life has went downhill. He probably didn't want to be seen by people and asked what  he was doing with his life.
67,"He’s going to tell them no matter what, that’s the thing. Even if you pay him, the money will go up at some point and at some point he’ll tell them. What I’d recommend is getting ahead of it and telling your parents yourself, while also filling them in on your bros addiction. "
68,"""But I love dinner""
That made my heart ache I love you and your passion for dinner😢"
69,"Um, wtf? That's my only reaction. WTF. I can't even fathom what would drive your husband to say that. 

Either he vastly misunderstood the situation or there's something else going on with him where he's angry with you that he's projecting onto this."
70,"This is about control.  Your sister has lost control and she wants it back.  That's especially noticeable because she quickly says that after one good meeting, she wants to have the siblings back to meet with the church.  

Your sister, and the church, can say ""We Miss You!"" all they want.  They want you and your siblings back under their control, living life on their terms.

If your siblings meet your sister, I think they need someone to accompany them (a friend or other family member).  And that meeting needs to be in a neutral public place (restaurant?), not at anyone's house.

And if your siblings choose to go back to the church, you should tell them that you love them and will open your arms to them if they ever need you again.

But you shouldn't meet up with your sister, or the church members, and you should maintain NC with your sister."
71,"&gt;A couple days ago she was texting him at around 9 pm at night saying she is kind of drunk and that she needs dick in the next week and to “buckle up” because he’s the dick. He laughed it off saying she’s drunk and they will talk when she’s sober.

&gt;She then says “you have literally already dicked me honey”. 

&gt;I ask him to **show me who he’s texting and he refuses and deletes their convo and tells me it was just his mobile carriers text that texted him.**

I apologize for being blunt, but you are a fool if you buy his horseshit. He's cheating on you, and it could not be more obvious."

73,"How exactly do you respond and handle the situation? Because right now, you’re teaching your kids that it’s normal for dad to come home and lash out and use his family as an emotional punching bag as cathartic relief for work stress. 

Stop being complicit. Stop being an enabler. Stop allowing him to take shit out on you and the kids. Maybe it doesn’t cross the line into abuse yet, but this is a very unhealthy dynamic to normalize "
74,"I'm going to go against the grain a little here.

It's often the case that if one partner makes significantly more, and takes care of more of the finances, the other one contributes more to the non financial aspects of the household, whether that's cleaning, cooking, shopping, taking care of kids, etc.

Or when there's an income disparity but couples are working similar amounts of hours, they then contribute proportionally to both the financial and housework side of things.

From your post, you ended up not in either category - he covers the bulk of the bills, but you then work long enough hours that it keeps you from contributing as much in non financial ways - and that money then goes to paying down your own debts.

It isn't fair that he turned down a fair split of expenses and turned that against you, but it may be his frustration at feeling like while he covers the bills for the two of you as a couple, most of your time and energy is spent on ""you"". That is, you're working multiple jobs, he sees you less, and you're able to do less around the house, and those extra jobs all go towards your own personal debts/loans/savings, while when he goes to work it's contributing to the two of you as a couple. That doesn't mean it's fair for him to hold it against you, but it might be worth approaching any conversations you have about this by realizing that maybe he'd rather you worked *less* and contributed more, not financially, but in terms of spending time with him."
75,I wouldn’t let her have your passwords. In addition I’d change the passwords to the ones she’s trying to guess. There’s no valid reason why she needs access to everything in you life if you’re already willing to show her. If she pressures you or gives you an ultimatum I’d drop her. This is concerning behavior

84,"You know you can look up court cases fairly easily online, right? Or you can go to the court house and get copies of what was filed. "
85,"I wouldn't say ""I didn't kill myself because of you"".

86,"&gt;I know that i shouldn't care, that nothing had really started,  

No, it sucks. Part of dating is trying to be realistic though. You can recognize this sucks. You can recognize that this was something that fizzled out early. You can recognize you were never really given a chance. It's fine. You can't focus on trying to pretend this doesn't suck - you'd be wasting your energy.

&gt;that i'll get other chances, and 100 others stuff i've read countless times... but i can't think that way. I'm asocial, but i still try to interact with other. I hoped that finally something could work out. 

Part of the trouble with dating is when you get a little too attached to someone like this, before it even starts. I think that is where your disappointment probably comes from. It's not that you got rejected, it's that you got rejected by HER, ""your crush"", something that you were personally deeply invested in hoping it would work out. 

You need to minimize the times where you become invested in someone, a lot, without really having a solid idea of if they're willing to try. You need to not go MONTHS where you have a crush on a girl, and work yourself up into finally asking her out, only to be crushed like this. React to it sooner than later, or don't react at all. If you're interested in someone you can't go months without figuring it out. 

Most women I am interested in are not super interested in me. Some of them will go on a date. Some of the dates won't really click. This is all ok - I'm having fun, we're out there getting to know each other, and well - I didn't spend months invested in these people. I used to be mad at this - I would be ""interested in"" at most a few women a year, because I would spend so long trying to get to know them, and it would turn out that...well...that we didn't work out at all, or never even stood a chance. And then OF COURSE I was convinced that I had bad luck - how can you go YEARS without meeting women?

I could. All I had to do was constantly focus on women who weren't giving me much back. "
87,"First, come on over to r/JUSTNOMIL. 

Second — I will be blunt. This woman is neither of your responsibilities. She has a husband. Period. 

Drop the fucking rope, man. Take her home, leave her there and leave the responsibility with the people who are actually responsible for her — herself and her husband. 

You and your wife are enabling her to abuse your children. "
88,"I would say the best way to break up with an abuser like him is through text and let the people close to you know what the deal is. Also to document everything this guy sends to you (in case you need to involve the police). 

Good luck and I hope you get this bastard out of your life. "
89,"I agree completely with this!  Normally I wouldn't suggest breaking up over text but you did it in person once but he became abusive.  I would send something like this ""I broke up with you yesterday and you would not accept it and became abusive.  I am breaking up with you and do not want to see you.  Do not come to my residence or the police will be called.  This is not negotiable.  Do not contact me again."".   Document everything and keep everything in text.  If you do for some reason have a conversation with him record it if you live in a one party consent state.  Based on what you wrote he is dangerous and you might need a protective order and evidence is helpful. "
90,"A similar thing happened to me a few years ago with a live-in girlfriend who turned out to be fucking the coworker who was giving her rides home from her restaurant job.

First it was ""I'm working late so I'll get a ride"" rather than me picking her up (she didn't drive.) Then it became ""the boss wants to take us out for drinks after the restaurant closes."" Then it was coming home at 4 a.m. with wet hair, claiming it had been raining. Along with that came vague stories about whom she was out with, and getting caught in lies when the friend she said she was out with asked her in front of me why they hadn't hung out in a while.

Sometimes these things are weird misunderstandings, but where there's smoke there's usually fire. If this is becoming a pattern -- and you said it's ""frequently,"" -- then there's something going on."
91,This isn't so much a weed problem as a severe communication problem. You need to have a frank discussion with her about the work load and its toll on you and your lack of relaxation outlets. Get to the bottom of this. Because the tone of your post tells me that resentment is a-brewing.
92,"Leave because you aren’t happy, that’s a valid reason.  Leaving because it’s your first relationship isn’t a valid reason. "
93,"Your BF is her MANAGER??

Your BF needs to go talk to HR, or his boss, make them *fully aware of the situation*, (because if she claims to have been sexually assaulted or harrassed by him they will believe her unless he has mentioned this shit first). The . he needs to ask them ""How do I handle this situation? X has harrassed me outside of work, gotten drunk, and tried to make me responsible for her wellbeing. Even after moving locations she followed me. I'm concerned because this is an unhealthy and unprofessional relationship for an employee to pursue with a manager and I am not sure how to draw the boundaries to make it clear to her that she needs to maintain a professional demeanour and not harrass me outside of work.""

All future conversations in person with her *need to have a 3rd person to witness.* Your BF needs to draw boundaries YESTERDAY. Thats the boundaries of a PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP.  If she texts him non-work crap the answer isnt to ignore. Its to SET THE BOUNDARY. ""Hi x. Did you need something work related?"" When the answer is no, ""Please only contact me regarding work-related matters. Thanks."" This is the FIRST THING HR and his Boss are going to ask if he's done yet. So has he actually set any boundaries and COMMUNICATED with her besides just ignoring her? Because thats not the same as saying ""Stop doing this.""

She comes into his office? ""I'm in the middle of something X, please email me to set a meeting."" She continues? He needs to get up, leave, and bring someone else in. She continues blathering on non-work related things, he corrects WITH WITNESS. ""X, I told you I was busy. I need you to stop coming to me about non-work related subjects. Do you understand?"" (She HAS to say yes. If she argues he needs to not argue back, he needs to repeat himself.)


Sheeeeeeeeesshshsshsehehs this whole thing makes me sweat profusely. "
94,"You cannot do much, your girlfriend needs to realize she’s being irrational. You said it yourself, her jealousy just shows you two things: how much she doesn’t trust you and how insecure she is. 

In my opinion, the relationship is quite unhealthy and the way she behaves would be a total dealbreaker for me. Now, if you want to make it work, that’ll require tons of effort to reassure her and help her build a kind of self esteem — however, she needs to realize you cannot just cut G off your life because she wants you to do so.

95,"Lawyer first, then therapist.

96,"So he sells lingerie? Or sextoys? Because I can't think of any other situation where it's professional to send messages like that.

This is also very cringy:

&gt; His defense was that no one knows who runs his multiple accounts so it's not a big deal

You know for one. Also it shows he's aware what he does is frowned upon.

He's acting shady, and you two don't seem to be compatible with regards to what's allowed in a relationship."
97,"After that conversation my mom has been watching my daughter while I work. I dont feel comfortable with them having her, part of me feels like I'll drop her off one night and not get her back. 

How would I find a custody lawyer? Is this really something that would need a lawyer? Can they really take her from me? 

Thank you, I hope things end well too. This isnt even something I thought I would ever have to worry about. "
98,"You're muddling together too many issues into one big mess. If she's listening to her friends over you/her own mind, that's a problem. If she's telling them an edited version of the facts, that's another problem. If she's said she wouldn't tell them bad things about you, but does, that's *another* problem (that said ""don't share relationship issues with friends"" is way too broad a statement - people need to talk to their friends about stuff sometimes, even their spouse!).

You getting distracted from the movie issue and laying into her friends instead is yet another problem. All the other incidents of your wife ""treating you unfairly"" are yet more problems. You giving her an ultimatum is a terrible idea. She could tell them they're overstepping/have the wrong idea without ruining the friendships.

Ultimately, **forget the friends**, they're incidental to the whole situation. Because if your wife has your back/knows her own mind/is happy, her friends can be telling her to leave you and she'll laugh in their face. Sure, she shouldn't want to be friends with people like that, but they may well be blowing off steam/overreacting/just airing opinions/whatever, it doesn't matter. If your wife has so little faith in you or your marriage that her friends' opinions can so easily sway her, the problem is **her**, not the friends, and it's not your place to dictate who she can and can't be friends with, even if you hate them.

Also, if you've got a series of grievances about her mistreating you, double standards, watching movies with friends but not you, breaking promises, etc., fine, but resolve them **with her**. Again, the friends' opinions are irrelevant. Go to couples counselling, have a healthy conversation, hell, divorce her because you think she's unreasonable, all viable options. Getting her to cut off her friends, whatever your opinion of them, is not the answer, because it doesn't address the inherent problems in your relationship, and taking her refusal to do that as some sort of slap in the face doesn't actually solve anything.

If you leave just because of this ultimatum, you're basically leaving because you don't like your wife's friends, and that's ridiculous. If you're going to leave it should be about one of the other more significant issues here, but you should also try and work on them first.

Edit: Your edit clarifies things, and it's why I wasn't leaning too hard on you being the problem, so much as the whole situation being the problem. I stand by my point that the friends aren't the core problem, **there are lots of problems**. Trouble is it still ends up with a degree of blame being pointed at you, because fine, your wife's controlling and difficult, *but you married her and have enabled this conduct*. Doesn't make her treatment of you your fault, but doesn't make the friends of any real significance either. The problem is when she told you who you can and can't spend time with, you went along with it rather than telling her no. You protected her reputation when she showed no consideration for yours. You've ""forced yourself to forget"" her mistreatments. Honestly the biggest problem with this post is that you seem to have normalised or disregarded her shitty conduct to such an extent that you barely see it as the crux of the problem, instead your title and post are mainly about your wife's interactions with her friends! Leave, break free, be happy elsewhere.

&gt; who in the right mind could accept such treatment for years?  

Well...exactly! And yet you have, for some reason. And at the risk of using loaded language I don't mean to victim blame, but if you find this behaviour so intolerable it's on you to leave - honestly I think you should have done a long time ago and I don't get why you married her."
99,"I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to allow him to come to your house.  He escalated yesterday and he may hurt you today.  Tell him no and call the police if he shows up.  You told him that you want to break up, stand behind that decision and protect yourself.  "
100,Don't stay in a relationship with someone who can't respect you as an equal.
101,"Every once in a while it's good to ask yourself the question, ""If I met my partner today, would they still be somebody I would be interested in dating?""

If the answer is yes, then great!

If the answer is no, then you need to decide if the current tough time is borne out of situational complications that can be overcome, or longterm changes that are woven into the fabric of your partner's personality or the relationship dynamic."
102,"Stop being a martyr.

Your wife is stressed and pregnant. Her list of wants and needs is endless and you are putting all this pressure on yourself to fulfill every single one. Just stop.

She may not be as physically able to contribute as she once was, but I am sure she can prepare herself modest meals, like cereal and toast. You can make the bigger meals, like dinner. Not every craving of hers must be indulged, not every whim must be satisfied. Occasionally? Sure. We all do that for the people we love. Constantly? Come on.

You are burning yourself out and fixating on the weed because it's the one stress reliever you have left, but the weed doesn't matter. Work on your stress levels by reducing your workload. For example, why did you have a swing set installed for infants? That's something you could've tackled in a year or two. 

When your wife asks you for something, have her rank it on a priority scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not urgent and 10 being maximum urgent. Like, driving her to the hospital in labor is 10. 1 would be pick up crackers from the grocery store. Please push back if you think she's abusing the scale, ranking everything a 10. Please say ""no"" when you think something is unnecessary or ridiculous. You'll find that frying pickles sometimes will become more enjoyable when you're not running yourself ragged putting up a swingset for infants."
103,"So wait, he left at 7:30 at night to ""get a massage"" and didn't come back to the hotel until midnight? 

Crackers and massages ain't your problem. "

105,"My boyfriend is actually in the middle of his Ph.D, and just passed his proposal (already done his comp, and this was the last big step before the defense). My boyfriend is remarkably hardworking, dedicated, and great with self-starting- but this degree process is still killing him slowly. He has 3 publications (in his field that is like 5 years of research) and a book chapter, and he still has at least 1 publication before he feels comfortable finishing. This is not including the conferences, talks, posters, and other work he does for his advisor. On top of TA-ing. 

Your boyfriend really doesn't understand, and my bet is that he will not get in. Even for people who have all of the skills needed for a Doctoral degree, very few actually get there. If he manages to get it, it will be a slap in the face and my guess is that he will blame everyone but himself, and move on to fixate on something else. 

I'm not saying I would have one foot out of the door of this relationship, but I would make sure you have your affairs in order in case this becomes the self-perpetuating pity loop it seems it is heading."

You have THREE kids, you're about to have a fourth, you do everything, AND you work, and you've already kicked him out once for not working? AND he now wants you to meal prep his ridiculous diet? Dude... no... what is going on. 

What does he do, apart from money, that contributes to the house? Because it sounds like he works 8hr a day, and YOU work 18hrs a day, 7 days a week. Do you get a day off? An hour off? Does he ever take all three kids out and lets you get a break? "
107,"&gt; You can refuse to take her. No medical facility can force an unsafe discharge. Perhaps she becomes a ward of the state, and loses her assets.

My bet is when she got admitted to the current medical facility, they asked the family to sign something that they'd be her guarantors and would pay the bill if she can't. This is exceedingly common with skilled nursing facilities - they aren't run by idiots, so they try anything possible to make sure they don't get stiffed.

It's a little bit of a red flag to me that she was made to promise that she will never, ever discuss her marriage issues with her friends. While a degree of privacy is expected, for it to be unacceptable to discuss her life (marriage) with her most trusted friends makes me think something is going on that you'd be ashamed for other people to know. Even if that's not the case, your wife is an adult and you can't hide her from the outside world's influence."
116,"You play along and just know that she will actually be twisted up in knots on the inside with the knowledge that she is a huge fake and she will be constantly scared that she will be found out as a fraud.

117,"&gt;On top of this, he's told me so so many times I'm fat, he doesn't like fat bodies, has shown me pictures of these girls saying those are the bodies he loves. Recently he said he just couldn't understand why any guy would find a fat girl attractive, and I said he was close minded and what he finds attractive is not universal. I told him at my heaviest I had guys calling me beautiful and sexy. His response? They probably say that to get you in bed.

Your dad from the sounds of it adores spending time with you too and I doubt you'd ever come second or even be forgotten about. Your dad may be feeling a little lonely, sit and have a chat with him about how you feel, he seems a very understand person. 
Let me put it this way, when you've grown up and gone off to college, started your own family and life, would you want your dad still to be on his own? I understand how it must feel, my dad left me and I hated the fact my mum found someone new. But now, he's the most amazing step dad and he makes my mum incredibly happy. Speak with your dad, he might surprise you 💜"

121,"You cannot have a healthy discussion with a person who does not want to have a healthy one back.

Your boyfriend is abusive.  Full stop.  There *is* no healthy way to be a part of an abusive relationship.

The age difference may be part of the reason he acts abusive (because he figures that he's older and therefore wiser, and that you are, therefore, younger and dumber).  Or, alternatively, the fact that he's abusive may be the reason for the age difference (because he went for a younger women because no experienced woman would put up with his abuse).

Either way, the age difference is what it is, and the abuse is what it is; it doesn't *matter* whether the chicken came first, or the egg.

What matters is that there is nothing you can do to have a healthy relationship *with this guy*.

So you have two choices:

1. Decide that you want a healthy relationship, and come to terms with the fact that it means you'll have to end this and go find a guy who is not abusive that you *can* have a healthy relationship with, or

2. Decide that the abuse you suffer at his hands is worth it because of whatever excuses you tell yourself to try to make it OK in your head.

...I recommend option #1."
122,"&gt; She has told me she doesn't want anything ever to do with them again, she doesn't want to even let them know of their grandchild when we decide to have children.

&gt; her father invited 30 more people to our ceremony to which we did not know about until it happened, we had also paid for 120 people to be fed at our reception party and he had also invited 50 more people to the party later that evening.

You are really downplaying just how little respect these people have for your boundaries and your own agency. There is a difference between ""hey so I invited 1 or 2 people, I hope you don't mind""  and ""hey I invited 30-50 extra people because I wanted to, enjoy your wedding"". 

I also second that in the ""thank you"" letters you send back to the gift givers you mention you appreciate the thoughtful gifts, but sadly your in-laws made the decision to take them so sadly you will not be able to enjoy their kindness.      "

131,"21F here. IMO, there’s a balance between the comments here:

- BF should not talk to you that way (calling you “fucking annoying”).

- He likely is feeling caretaker burnout if he’s the only one supporting you emotionally.

- IMO, he didn’t communicate that burnout well at all. Saying, boiled down, that his life is great except for you is insulting, even if he meant it another way.

Be patient, be cautious, and always, *always* ask before initiating contact when she gets in this state of mind. Ask her if it's okay if you make her a cup of tea or get her a comforting blanket; doing gentle gestures like that help me when I'm in that mental state. At some point she's probably gonna fall into repeated apologizing for this, and all you can do is reassure her that it's okay and really not a big deal to clean. 

She's expecting the other shoe to drop - you're not dropping it, you're not even upset with her, and she's *scared* because there's a lack of punishment where she's used to it.

Hopefully your fiance isn't so damn clueless he actually argues with you as to why he is in fact entitled to eat or drink ALL of someone's food or drink when he was only offered a little bit. But if he does, shut it down and tell him straight out that it's rude to be the taker and never the giver.

Maybe your fiance is the baby in the family and that's why he has a warped idea of sharing. Nobody wants to be a man's mother, but some people need some shame on their game to straighten up."

153,"No. She cannot move in with you again. You need to stop providing for your ungrateful MIL. You need to put your foot down, for your family's sake.

You and your wife have done more than enough to help your MIL- cut them off and focus on your own lives. 

If your wife refuses to stop enabling your MIL, get a divorce. You need to put your kids first and keep them away from this toxic, abusive influence. 

You continue to enable your MIL's bad behavior. She was in a care facility. She was having a difficult time because she CHOSE to racially abuse staff and refuse rehab. If she continues this behavior, she will continue to get kicked out of assisted care homes.

Second, like everyone said get a lawyer immediately. Do not take any chances that they will spring something on you.

If nothing else, the police might be able to spook her a little, and a police report on file should help you get a transfer without having to pay for it. I mean, if there's a verifiable police report that she has cameras in your room, she should be expelled and then your problem is solved."

It really sounds like she is just very insecure. 

You sound like a great friend taking her out for coffee and asking her what’s wrong instead of getting angry! It could help to talk to her again and remind her that it is completely normal to struggle with these kind of things. Planning a wedding is hard work for everyone and she shouldn’t be comparing herself to the unrealistic ideas she might have about your life. Maybe look into hiring a planner together as others have suggested. Good luck to the both of you! "

It hurts more because you have gone above and beyond for her and why is she treating YOU like this.  Welcome to parenthood.  You are the safe place.  You are the one who didn't leave her.  You get to be the lightning rod of all of the emotional shit she is carrying around.  It sucks!  It is easy/safe to attack you than deal with complicated stuff.  Oh...and her friends really are the center of her world; but she does appreciate you and will tell you sometime before she's 22.

Solution:  1.  Self Care  2.  Therapy for BOTH of you  3.  Patience.  You are here for the marathon not a sprint.  You have years ahead of you so get support to make it."

To be blunt, this guys is treating you like shit, regardless of whether or not you're labeling his behavior as ""psychopathic tendencies."" In your short post I quoted 3 things that could be easy dealbreakers by themselves: he lies to you, manipulates you, intentionally hurts/upsets you for his own amusement, and makes you feel like your life is lived walking on eggshells. That's an absolutely shitty relationship no matter what label you slap on it. Why on earth are you staying? Get the hell away from this guy."

So I’ve done it. He actually called me to ask what time he should come round and I told him it was over. He tried to plead with me, he said he loved me and that we can make it work but I just said no, it’s over and put the phone down. I blocked him on everything and have now changed my cell phone number. 

I’m staying with my best friend for the rest of the week to be safe.

Despite all of this I do feel embarrassed and ashamed about how the relationship panned out. There was a lot of arguing and I do feel like I was a psycho girlfriend - I’m just re reading all the comments on here and trying to drill it into myself that this was abusive/he was gaslighting me but I think I need to see a therapist to really understand that for myself.

175,"Very much agreed. Possible agoraphobia, or anxiety, or both. Weed may have been to self medicate. 

Anxiety issues can start up for little to no reason, the injury outside would be enough in some people, it's not logical but it happens. 

If so, he needs therapy, possibly medication, and possibly a gentle kick up the arse. Restarting motivation is hard and sometimes a push helps.

It's also reasonable to set a goal of when he needs to move out. Whether that's to rent, or if he still has a chunk of money, get enough together to buy. "
176,"Honestly I think how you reacted when asked to clean the bathroom wasn't the best way to handle that (you're moving out in 5 days, how much closer to the date does it need to be?). However, her throwing out your medicine &amp; belongings is a complete over reaction. I think the other commenters advice of moving all your things out of communal areas so it can't happen again is a great idea, and then just moving out asap. You've both burnt bridges here, maybe best to just move on quickly. "
177,"Sounds to me like she's partying after hours.  Could be with friends, could be with a boyfriend, but no way is she actually working those hours (even for deliveries or whatever).

That’s some pretty massive trauma to her though. We haven’t rubbed dogs noses in their messes in decades. So what happened to her is pretty degrading and horrific. Let her feel her feelings and don’t try and convince her that she’s being silly. 

The best suggestion I have? Just start narrating your actions. “I’m going to reach for the remote now.” “I’m going to stand up and go to the bathroom now. Would you like some tea? Or wine? You deserve wine. I’ll bring back some wine.” “I’m coming back with the wine, dear. Gonna put it on a coaster and sit down on the other side of the couch.”

181,"I'm concerned that you have an unhealthy relationship with wine. I'm a social drinker, myself, and have put away a bottle and a half between myself and one other person in an evening on occasion. But there are a bunch of things here that are strange:

&gt; I rarely drink until I pass out 

The correct frequency of time for someone without an alcohol problem to drink until they pass out is not ""rarely."" It is ""never."" You're 22, so, whatever, if it's happen three times to you in the past five years, maybe that's not such a big deal.  But if it's happened to you three times in the last year, that's a HUGE problem. 

&gt;  It started with me having a box of wine under the table and having a drink or two to my dinner on a thursday night and them thinking it was weird to drink wine with dinner.

I doubt they think it's weird to have a glass or two of wine with dinner. I suspect they think it's SUPER strange to have a whole f'ing box of wine *under the table* while you're having dinner.  That screams someone who is trying to hide how much alcohol they drink, and yet drinks a ton of it. 

(Nobody who drinks because they love the taste of wine brings a BOX of wine to dinner and stashes it under the table, either). 

&gt; another friend of mine has told me that I have a drinking problem which I responded to with saying I never get drunk

This is clearly a lie since you just told us you occasionally drink to the point of passing out. Lying to your friends about your alcohol use is another common sign of alcoholism. 

If your friends are not inviting you to social events that include alcohol it's because *they disagree with your self-assessment that your drinking is not a problem*.  What they're telling you, in so many words, is that they don't think you can be trusted to limit yourself to a reasonable amount of alcohol, and that they don't enjoy your company when you're drunk. 

I mean, they've flat out told you this, it sounds like. 

You say it ""doesn't impair or impact your life in any way,"" but your behavior when drunk has clearly impacted your social life, in terms of costing you invitations to events you'd like to go to. 

Since they are still inviting you to ""dry"" events it seems clear that they enjoy the company of sober you, just not the company of drunk you.  So if you feel hurt, remind themselves it's not *you* they have a problem with, but rather the combo of you and alcohol.  Is essence, *you* are choosing alcohol over going out with them. 

I understand that you do not *feel* drunk, which is also very common for alcoholics. But what should be crystal clear is that you appear and behave unpleasantly drunk to other people. 

I know plenty of people who were problem drinkers when they were your age who have healthier relationships with alcohol now, so I'm not saying you need to go cold turkey forever.  But I also think, you know, it wouldn't hurt you to go dry for a while, like, a few months at least, and see what happens, how you feel, and how it changes how you interact with people. 

Good luck. "

He ""monitored"" your spending and demanding receipts to exert his control over you... And berated you for being ""bad with money"", with no evidence of such to ""prove"" he was ""right"" to control the money.

Now he tells you to stay unemployed (with him as your only source of income) and makes you beg him for money to pay for essentials like medication.

Abuse is not about violence. Abuse is about the abuser exerting control over the victim's behavior (so the abuser can feel powerful) and making it as difficult as possible for the victim to leave.

Please get a job and open a new bank account that he cannot access to have your deposits sent to. Make your exit plan and get away from this man. This will only get worse for you."

However, it is very rude of him to ignore you asking for something to make you feel better. 

His behavior with the wine and cheese, where he knew it was making you sick and did it just to spite you, is cruel and flat out disgusting. He sounds like a giant ass. Does he do stuff like that often?"

If someone told you on a first date that they haven't learned basic human functionalities, would you go on a second date?

So why are you staying with someone like that?"
195,"Nah, ""your house your rules"" works both ways. It's your house, your rules. You show them respect in their home, and you should be able to expect the same from them."
196,"I have been on both sides of this. My previous boyfriend made significantly less than me, so I did the bulk of the financial support. It didn’t bother me to pay the mortgage and utilities, as I was already doing that without him. It did bother me on things where I was now essentially paying double to cover both of us, especially big stuff like traveling. I understood he couldn’t afford to do it without me, which left me in the tough spot of choosing to go without my boyfriend and have him resent me, or me not going or paying for us both, either option leading towards me resenting him.

I’m now in a relationship with someone who makes significantly more than me. Probably because of my previous relationship, I am hyper-sensitive to making sure I’m contributing fairly and in a way that builds no resentment on either side. Whenever we have a big expense like travel, I start the conversation with something like “I can do this trip if you do the airfare and I get the rental car”. I’m always looking for ways to proactively show I want to contribute, rather than waiting for him to ask me to contribute.

Either way, it can be stressful if you don’t communicate (often) about it. While it’s great that you talked about things early on to set some parameters, this has  to be an ongoing conversation. Having been on both sides, I can say that it’s a lot less stressful for me now being the one with the lesser income, which I never would have suspected. I understand your stress and am not diminishing it, just remember that he has stress from this too. Just because a person has money doesn’t mean that it’s not tough to start footing someone else’s expenses, especially when they were used to having it to invest/save/spend for themselves before. I’d suggest another talk in which you tell him how you’re feeling and ask him what he needs from you, then keep an open conversation, especially when new mutual expenses arise. "

You'll be in foreclosure so fast it won't even be funny. "
204,"Please please please don’t marry this man. This behavior will not stop if you get married. It will only escalate until he can control every aspect of your life. Get a job, your own private bank account, move out, and dump his ass. I know this seems hard to impossible right now but you are strong enough to take back your life. No person deserves to have their entire life controlled like this. "
205,"I think if you present it very calmly and matter-of-factly you'll come out smelling like a rose and he'll come out smelling like the shit he is.

Sorry to break it to you.""

Edit: also I would maybe reconsider these people as friends. They heard this guy repeatedly call you a crazy stalker even though you had told them you'd been flirting with each other and they didn't bother to call him out OR ask you about it."
206,"If you saying, ""I know you don't want to talk about getting married, but I'm feeling confused and I need us to have a conversation about the future"" is going to stop him from proposing to you, then he doesn't really want to marry you.

He can feel apprehensive about it, and he can want to surprise you with the proposal itself, but asking you to wait an indefinite amount of time while he makes up his mind isn't fair. "

Why is changing your name even a discussion topic for your brother?   Do you want to do it or have you been pressured?

You and your wife should probably have gone to couples counseling before you married to set some ground rules for your life together.  You definitely need to do that now to help her understand why framing the issue as making a choice between her brother and you is detrimental to your marriage.

Either way I refuse to lose my daughter and I have been looking online for any family lawyers that I can talk to in the next few days. 

Thank you very much. "
223,"Then legally, shouldn’t he be responsible for the bill??? It sounds like you guys have been taken advantage of. I’d really consider talking to a lawyer or financial planner or something"
224,"That was a wild ride.  I'm so sorry for your experiences and you are an incredible person for breaking out.

&amp;#x200B;

This smells suspiciously like a trap.  If I were you, I would not, under any circumstance, go to that community and would warn my siblings of the potential risks.  What if they psychically force your brother and sister to stay while hurting you and kicking you out?

&amp;#x200B;

Meet on a neutral ground.  There is too much emotion from both sides to go back to anyone's home base."
225,Get out.  Never stay with anyone who threatens you with violence.
226,"&gt; TL;DR: What can my family do to support my cousins? 

Treat them like you always have, or if you weren't super close before, reach out to them more often. Let them know that they have other family than their parents, and that family still loves them.

You don't need to support them financially, but if you do, don't make it permanent. They'll need to learn to make their own way eventually, as all adults do (or should). But emotionally? Just be there for them."
227,"Exactly. He has been informed that she has broken up with him. He knows she has left him. He isn't being ghosted. The fact that he said, ""no, you're NOT leaving me"" did not take away his knowledge of the fact that she does not wish to be with him.

She needs to do whatever she can to stay safe. She does not need him to agree to the breakup, or even inform him again that it's happening. Unless it's a message from a safe place for the purpose of establishing boundaries, IF that will be helpful in him leaving her alone, or proving that a restraining order is needed. I'm not sure of the legal requirements for that."
228,"&gt; He started crying about how he thought he could have changed my mind later.

I had a vasectomy at 28. When my own GP refused to contemplate it, I went private. Fast forward a couple of years and I have a new partner. I am particular about safe sex and don't practice unprotected sex until both partners have had a clean STD panel. Obviously, the vasectomy came up (hur hur hur) and she exploded. Apparently I had ruined her vision of settling down at 30 with 2.4 kids and a dog and demanded that I get the vasectomy reversed. And that was the end of the relationship.

This guy thought he could coerce you into carrying his children. His means of doing that: threats. So how many other things would he threaten? He wants an open relationship, better give it to him or he will leave. He wants you to dress in a certain way, better do it or he will leave. You gain weight, better lose it or he will leave. The point of this well beaten horse is that the moment you open the door to this sort of abuse, it is very hard to close.

"
229,"Lawyer first
 
STD check next

Therapist after that."
230,"Nobody here really has experience with coming into a fortune unexpectedly.

There's a reason why lottery winners are mostly broke. _After_ they win the lottery.

He needs to put the goddamn brakes on all of that talk. On helping his family _and_ friends. Of course, he probably already fucked up by talking about it and suggesting this to his family. If he hasn't, he shouldn't. There will be one or two who will feel entitled to that money and get extremely resentful if he does not keep giving.

He needs to keep this information on the lowest of downs.

He needs to get to an accountant or other some sort of financial planner immediately.  
Get _his_, and only his, debts settled. Blank the slate.  
Get that money into some sort of investment strategy where he can get paid from the interest being made off of it rather than the principle.  
If there's not enough money to get a comfortable living wage from the interest, just leave the money to mature as a guaranteed retirement fund.  
If there is some principle left, sure, take a vacation, maybe help out someone. But still, he probably does not have enough money to both help everyone he wants _and_ not have to worry about money any more."

Also next time you move in with someone, make sure you have a lease signed to help you legally in cases like these.
Sure she felt uncertain but she shouldn't be offering to let you  move in.
Even if she didn't realize how she felt, she still needs to face the consequences of her flakiness."
233,"This is a bigger flag than the original issue you wrote in about. 

&amp;#x200B;

He constantly lied to you about what he was wiling to pay for, pressured you to go into debt to see him, then convinced you to move away from any of your safety nets.

&amp;#x200B;

And NOW he's trying to get even more of your time/money even though you already have 3 jobs. This sounds like a relationship that will just get worse. "
234,"I'm a gamer mom about your moms age and all my sons friends want to play with me all the time.  I had to laugh at this a little bit.  We each have our own consoles though.

You think your mom would be into gaming enough that she would get her own PS4?  You could all play together then.  You and her could play together too.  I have a great time playing with my son.  

Nothing says ""I love you"" like sticking your mom in the face with a plasma grenade.  (We've been playing Halo 3)"

236,"I'm sorry to hear that it didn't work out. I was hoping for the best.

Just remember that you're only 20, OP. You are still very young and you aren't anywhere close to doomed. Many people don't seriously date until their mid to late 20's, or even later. Hell, I'm 30 and my boyfriend is 43, and we didn't start dating until late last year. Both of us had been rejected and felt hopeless about love many times in the past. 

Keep practicing your social skills, hang out with your friends, and go places where you can meet people, and you will eventually find someone who will make you very happy.

"
237,"Your boyfriend sounds like he is either incredibly possessive / controlling but is doing a good enough job disguising it as “wanting to spend time with you” that you’re not recognizing it for what it is. 

1. It’s ridiculous that your boyfriend asked you to run out for cigarettes in the middle of the night. That’s not a normal relationship expectation. The only reasonable things to ask for in the middle of the night are medical items and MAYBE food if you’re pregnant. Why do you have to run out to buy him cigarettes? Why can’t he get them himself?

2. Calling you 30 times in a row is not normal, acceptable behavior. Neither is screaming at you for going to work. He is making you feel bad for trying to earn money to support both of you. Let that soak in. He has convinced you that you going to work to earn money to help feed &amp; house him is somehow hurtful to him, instead of bein massively appreciative that one of you is now employed. 

3. I don’t know what this stomach thing is, but it seems awfully convenient if it prevents him from running the errand to buy his own cigarettes but does not prevent him from wanting to go out to breakfast at the crack of dawn. 

4. What is your boyfriend bringing to the table? Does he pay any bills? Does he take care of the apartment? Does he do the shopping / errands? What does he contribute to the workload of your life together? Because from an outside perspective, it looks like you do everything for him &amp; he just gets mad that you can’t both provide for him &amp; spend every waking moment with him. "
238,It sounds like he's is really stressed and possibly depressed. This sounds like how I was a few years ago when I had work related stuff going on. I took it home with me and took it out on everyone. I eventually left that job and I am much happier. 
239,"I mean, I would never live with someone who would put the responsibility of THEIR actions on me. ""If you have a boyfriend over, I might sin and that would be your fault."" No. She's a grown up. She is allowed to make her own decisions but she doesn't get to mold everyone around her in her image to make her life easier."
240,"The problem is you really believe that being a ""good wife"" means you cook and clean and take care of your husband's physical needs like he's a baby. What do you even iron since he works at home and doesn't got to work in a dress shirt every day?

It turns out you found a husband who thinks you should be doing all that for him. If my spouse even insinuated I was a lazy piece of shit, they'd be living by themselves real soon."
241,"I flew with a 10 month old to Australia from the US once. It was exhausting and hard on my kid. If your parents need to see their grandchildren so badly, they should come to you instead of throwing temper tantrums to all and sundry."
242,"&gt; Otherwise she and I have no problems.

Oh, well in that case marry her. Are you out of your mind? She tried to burn your career to the ground and maliciously went behind your back on a hunch. You need to run, not walk, away from this relationship"
243,"Honestly, has this girl gotten any therapy? I have an inkling there was some kind of abuse going on, and it's part of the reason she's acting out as much as she is/why she lies as much as she does/etc. Being punished for eating outside of mealtimes is pretty fucking extreme."
244,You should head over to r/legaladvice
245,"&gt;&gt;you guys wont let him stay here

You're an adult, and this is your place. Your parents can't ""not let"" him stay at his own place. This is their choice, and you're being too conciliatory. It's not that he has to drive an extra hour to work, it's that it's *your place* that you share with him, and your parents can either get a hotel or stay home. (Don't pay for their hotel either, wtf.)"
246,"Personally if they want a meeting it should be through facetime or the sister herself can travel to way they are and rent a hotel room. They should not return anywhere to the ""community"" because even if they meet in a public place you can bet they will be ambushed by other members and the elders. This church sounds boredeline cultish."
247,"OP I think a lot of us in this thread are having a hard time figuring out where youre head is.  On the one hand you don't seem to grasp how weird and completely delusional his behavior is, even asking if you are in the wrong. On the other hand you seem quite self aware and even conscious that he could be abusive and sabotaging you.

Do you realize that his behavior is abnormal? 

Do you agree that his manipulative behavior and sabotage is abusive? 

Do you realize that you buying cigarettes for him at 2 in the morning when you have work is pretty weird and you didn't have to do it? 

Do you know his behavior won't change unless he *chooses* to gets help? 

Do you accept that a third party person who looks at your relationship at the moment will want you to break up with him because it's an abusive mess? 

Help us out here."
248,You can like girl's clothes and not be trans. Girl's clothes are way more interesting than boy's anyway. Let him explore and be accepting regardless.
249,"Talk about burying the lede, my gawd. "
250,"If you've already rejected him multiple times and he has just ignored you, it is at this point harrassment. Have you discussed this with an academic advisor or your professor? Sorry you are going through this. If he can't stop harassing you, he should be taken out of class."
251,"&gt; he’ll frequently whine to me he hasn’t hit his protein goal and guilt me by saying I must not care about his health

Wow, that's attractive behavior. My ovaries just dried up."
252,"Do you want a relationship with both of your parents moving forward? Yes? Then don't do this. You are not a lawyer. You are their son. You should be telling them that you won't discuss their divorce, that it's not fair to stick you in the middle, that you love them both equally and would like to continue to see them both but you will simply not discuss the divorce. The only advice you should give them is to get a lawyer, and to remember their lives together and to try to be fair so that you can ALL move on with your lives. The end. And stick to it. Don't convince them. Don't help them. Don't even discuss it. You are their child and not their lawyer. This will affect your relationships with them permanently if you start taking any sort of responsibility for this outcome."
253,"To recap the facts:

1. BIL is an asshole
2. Wife is non-confrontational about #1
3. You don't want to cut off the rest of the family just to avoid #1

Practise having a set of prepared responses, or non-responses for BIL.  Such as ""that sounds like something you'd say"", or a pointed look and an abrupt ""pass the bean dip"" (ie change the subject) or ""that's a really inappropriate thing to say at this place and time"" and depending if you can get away with it or not, a look of utter contempt and ""shoo"" or ""begone"" or ""I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? (repeatedly)"".  It's so easy to make a bully like this look like a complete fool, or to provoke him into an outburst just by being polite and firm.  Once he starts ruining everybody's time (instead of just yours), then the family will do something about it.  Do not allow them to passively make you their scapegoat/meat shield.  And if they ask you to just ignore him ""that's just the way he is"", well ""this just is the way I am"".

And talk to your wife about how to best support each other vs. BIL in future situations to present a united front.  She did try, but she can't make him not be an asshole. Decide together in advance, not on the spot, how you will both manage him in the future."
254,"If you can afford it, get the tattoo for yourself. Also, tell him that for your anniversary you'll be using the babysitting from your family to set up an appointment with a family counselor."
255,"You're not the one hurting your family.  He's the one hurting your family. Make sure to keep those records safe in multiple places.  Block him.  If he tries to start drama over that, show the records of his disgusting behavior.  I bet his wife would be appalled that he's hitting on someone else, let alone that he's hitting on their niece.  If their relationship goes downhill because she finds out, it's solely because of his awful behavior.

If I were your aunt, I'd want to know that my husband is making my niece uncomfortable by crossing boundaries."
256,Dumping her would be a good start.
257,When they say their age you dont need to share yours. Just disengage if they're too young. Turn the tables and call them creeps if they wont leave you alone or wont take no for an answer. 
258,The parents chose to pay for the wedding. That was a gift. The couple is not obligated to pay them back for any of it. That's the whole point of it being a gift.
259,"Honestly, stop accepting his invitations all together. You can still be friends with this person if you want, but no need to indulge them when you're doing them a favor. "
260,"You are helping, you are very close to a hero right now. 

Do you have any family nearby, and does your mom have any friends that can help. Also, call your Dad's family &amp; friends &amp; work. If they won't tell you where he is, ask if they can help you.  

This is a time you need your grandparents and aunts &amp; uncles to step up. 

Also, look for local resources either government or charity, your school might be able to assist you in this search. "
261,"I'd be suspicious of anyone who simultaneously insists they don't remember anything and definitely not going further than kisses.

Even if this is the extent of what she's done so far, that's bound to escalate. You've been together less than a year and she's flirting with, going to clubs with, and kissing other men. Let that sink in."
262,"This isn't really a question of who's right or wrong, or who other people agree with. You're both entitled to your boundaries and preferences, and sometimes they aren't going to line up. Either you find a way to compromise or you find a new partner.

Not having opposite sex sleepovers is a fairly common and reasonable boundary to have and her asking that of you is not really a red flag. However, she expects you to have known where her boundaries were before she expressed them to you and holds it against you that you didn't. And now that she's stated her position it seems like she feels entitled to your obedience instead of realizing she's making a fairly significant request.

It doesn't bode well. If you cave on this issue, you're going to resent her for imposing this on you and she's going to resent you for feeling imposed upon for something she feels should be automatic. If this is the worst disagreement you ever have in your relationship you might be able to make it work, but you're only 6 weeks in, so this is probably not going to be the last problem."
263,"Can you bring up your fears around telling him when you tell him? 

Explain that you are worried he will dismiss and judge you for this but it is your body and you just need his support on this—not a hard time. It’s an emotionally sensitive thing and you should be able to trust your partner to keep his comments to himself *if you ask him to.* 

That’s respecting explicit boundaries 101."
264,"&gt;  I feel terrible for choosing work over him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't. What you're doing is called 'being an adult'. You have a job to do, and if you don't want to end up homeless and/or starving, you need to work and get paid.

To be perfectly honest, I'm not ever sure I believe the whole stomach pain thing, the last thing I want when my stomach is hurting is food.

&amp;#x200B;"
265,"Aren't they smart? They probably are highfiving eachother for thinking of this and putting you in this situation. So, call their bluff: ""Mom, dad, I'll miss you, but i understand that you do not wish to stay in my apartment or get a hotelroom. As i'm not kicking out my partner who's also paying rent (i'm assuming your BF is not a bum), we'll see eachother again when you change your mind. Too bad about the planetickets, but maybe you can rebook for that weekend to somewhere else.""  

If you kick your boyfriend out, you're absolutely going to show your parents that not only do they get a say in your relationship, but that this isn't a serious relationship. You must not truly love him, because you're not standing up for him. It will undermine your relationship and how it's perceived within your family. "
266,"OP, I am SO SO SO glad to read this update!! While I know it hurts now, it was absolutely the right move. 

I was in your position when I was 32. I also gave him 3 months to think about it. And then he charmed and manipulated me into ""Once we are better off financially/fix up the house to be safe for a baby/have better health insurance"" etc line. 

If you needed encouragement to stick to your decision? Know how staying worked out for me? I'm now 46 years old, never got to get married, never got to have kids, and have been 'playing house' for 20 years. I'm so over it. 

TL;DR - If you have to convince someone to marry you, it really isn't right. I hope you find yourself again, your new sense of normal, and (eventually) your Mr Right that can't wait to marry you, not have to be pushed, pulled and dragged into it! Onward and upward!"
267,Do you wonder if his constant current need for contact is to intentionally stop you writing essays? If you don't write them you can't go out of state to college. There is no way he's happy that you plan to move away.
268,"Has he always been like this? Honestly, it sounds unbalanced."
269,"If you do share what you saw, it's still not your fault. The cheater ruined it long ago. 

It's quite an accusation. Be prepared to be called a liar.  I personally would want to know if my friend saw something like this. 

"
270,"Personally, I wouldn't be able to trust him again. He didn't come forward. He's also too old to be don't this shit."
271,Don't stay in a relationship with someone you can't trust and doesn't trust you. Three grief isn't worth it for either of you.
272,I wrote this on your other post. Get out of there girl that’s not healthy. 
273,"I may have missed it, but where in this does she love you?  Because if she did, in my experience, she would make sure YOU had food."
274,"1) Do not go back to the community. Meet outside it at a neutral location. Have your GF waiting in the car. Do not tell your sister or husband, but have her ready to call the police if necessary.
2) Go with them for emotional support. You need to be there if they are. You need to keep them grounded.
3) Focus on being the neutral third party. If things get too emotional, keep them on track. Just because they have a relationship with Brainwashed Sister doesn't mean you have to.
4) Talk ahead of time about what to discuss and how much information to give out. I.e. do not give out addresses, or workplace info, at least at first. Keep details vague. *assume sister may go back to community and tell them everything. They may try to pull at least Younger Sister back in, especially into what sounded like a pre-arranged marriage.*

Approach this in the best way to protect your siblings. When older sister asks about you you just say ""I am here as support for Younger Siblings. I don't want to have a relationship with you at this time, after what you said to me.""

Even if you really do not feel comfortable...please give this advice to your siblings.
1) Do not meet at the community at first. DO NOT.
2) Meet at a public place 
3) Have a ""getaway car"" with a trusted friend in it.
4) Have a signal for the friend to call the police. Such as, keep the friend on the phone in your lap. So they can hear the conversation. If you hang up or say a code word, the police need to be called.
5) Do not give out home address or workplace information. Get a PO Box ahead of time for her to send letters to if you wish. 
6) Do not give out too much personal information.
7) Realize that sister is brainwashed. The ""community"" has all the signs of a cultlike mentality. *Protect yourselves first*. You cannot help Brainwasher Sister if you are kidnapped, taken prisoner, harmed, forced into marriage, silenced, targetted, or otherwise unable.
8) Practice NOT JADEING; JADE stands for Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain. Do not do this. You will accidentally give out information you dont mean to.
9) Assume her husband is also part of the ""community"" and do not trust him. Assume anything you tell sister will be reported back to him.
10) Learn about DARVO: Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. They will try to do this.
11) Learn Info diet and grey rock. Let her do most of the talking. Do not give out too much information. *I KNOW SHE IS YOUR SISTER BUT SHE IS ALSO STILL BRAINWASHED. HER LIFE HAS NOT BEEN NORMAL. SHE BELIEVES THOSE NOT IN THE ""COMMUNITY"" ARE EVIL. SHE MAY DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO BRING YOU BACK TO IT TO ""SAVE"" YOU.*
12) Build the relationship up over time.


I will try to think of what else I can tips wise but please reach out if you need me to clarify "
275,"This reminds me of the scene in American Psycho where Bateman/Bale is having sex with the prostitutes but spends the whole time looking at himself in the mirror and flexing for the camera and clearly using these women as sex toys while he got off on his own narcissism.

The movie scene was equal parts funny and fucked up. Your boyfriends behavior isn't a movie, but it's fucked up without being funny whatsoever. Because it's your life, not a movie.

I'd just be honest with him about what you're noticing. Tell him that it's becoming a turnoff that he's acting so self-absorbed and appearance-focused. Tell him that you want him to be happy and confident in his appearance, but that this is way over the line. Especially the stuff about sex. It'll be hard for him to hear, just focus on the facts and behaviors in a non-judgmental way (ie, I notice you post X selfies per day on IG, I notice when we have sex you do XYZ thing, I notice you spend much more time looking in the mirror, etc) and how those behaviors make you feel (ie, I feel X when you do Y, I feel uncomfortable, I feel myself losing attraction to you, etc).

Hopefully that's a wakeup call for him. But IDK how you could be with someone like this long-term if he doesn't seriously curb this behavior."
276,"If you contact him now, you'll be indicating that 385 days of plaintive posting is an effective way of getting your attention. Don't feed his obsession. Ignore him and hopefully he'll eventually move on."
277,"&gt;I also don’t think it’s fair that I have to clean on my own without any help. 

But you’re not cleaning the whole place on your own without any help, she cleaned the kitchen and trash.

Look she had absolutely no right to throw your stuff out, and she needs to reimburse you for it (and if she doesn’t I’d tell her you will be taking her to small claims court). But you also don’t sound like a great roommate if you don’t see any issue with people being forced to use a really dirty bathroom for 4 or 5 days because you don’t want to clean it twice before moving out. That’s gross."
278,"&gt; and thought that comparing your girlfriend to others was normal. 

Seriously. Unless this guy is from another country and hasn't been here long he knew what he was doing. Telling your SO you wish they looked more like a porn star is the third rail of relationships. Literally everyone knows that. I refuse to believe that this guy was just a regular nice dude and out of the blue was like ""I wish almost every part of your body was nicer."" Are you sure this was the first time? "
279,Is there a possibility this guy is homophobic aswell as a narcissistic piece of shit?

281,"If your instructor doesn't take you seriously and you are in the US, you can and should go to the university's title 9 office and make a complaint there."
282,"Yep.  I really don't understand the comments here that are sympathizing with the parents or acting like OP has no say/wasn't harmed (those were his gifts, too).  There's even a comment here that says the couple was morally obligated to give the gifts to the parents. "
283,This guy sounds like a stalker and I’m surprised you didn’t get a restraining order at the time...I strongly recommend you do not engage.
284,"I was about to recommend a serious discussion about the division of animal welfare labor until this:

285,"I have a very severe panic disorder that can lead to dissociation episodes. I do the grounding techniques a lot. 

First off I would just like to say that you are an amazing person and the world needs more people like you. 

I work in a very high stress and high work work volume industry and the place I work is very very very busy. My boss is amazing. She also has a panic disorder and understands me completely. My boss is not shy about affection or praise. She constantly tells me how well I’m doing and how she’s happy I work for her. She checks in on me multiple times through the day, particularly on busier than average days. A couple times through the day she will ask me if she can help me with clients or if I need a breather to take a walk. She makes sure I’ve eaten and is always supportive. 

Like people have said above I would suggest making sure Dan knows that he is valued at the company. So valued that you want to make sure he is well. If you send him home make sure he knows it’s because you are want him to be more relaxed and not that he’s doing a poor job. Let him know that, within reason, you will help him. Maybe join him for lunch a couple days a week? Invite him out for dinner or drinks? 

You really do sound like a great person and mentor for Dan. He’s lucky to have somebody like you in his life let alone his professional life. "
286,"Your EX held you hostage against your will. This is tantamount to kidnapping. Let that sink in for a moment.

This is a violent act that shows a complete lack of respect for you as a human being.

You need to never see or talk to him again.

---

Does he have keys to your apartments/home? If so, call a locksmith and have them rekeyed.

Then tell your EX by phone of email that you will never see him again. Put his stuff into a box and have a courier service pick them up and take them to him.

If he shows up at your door, tell him to go away. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR. If he does not leave, just call the cops. (Tell them that he kept you against your will the last time you saw him.)

Your BF is an abuser. Plain and simple. Things will escalate."
287,"Another thing that is making me hesitant to even attempt to work through this, is that she is very interested in my inheritance and what I'm going to spend it on. I don't want to spend any of it, just keep it in savings. She wants to buy new  very high end furniture and go on a trip."

289,This is normal child behaviour. Mouse is comfortable around you and considers you part of her family. There’s a really sad and unfortunate stigma against men being affectionate with children. Please don’t let that ruin your relationship with your gfs sister. 
290,"I think it's because this fantasy of yours is so easily achievable.  It's not like a sex-on-the-back-of-a-unicorn-with-a-supermodel-from-an-ancient-alien-planet fantasy, which would obviously never happen. Much like your attraction to the girl on the show -- she knows that's never going to happen.  But meeting a random girl for a one-nighter at a hotel?  That could happen.  Not that you would!

So perhaps try reassuring her that you have no intentions of acting on it.  And, now this is a little out there, but maybe you can include her in this fantasy?  Do a little role playing perhaps.  Have her go into a hotel bar before you and then you can come in later and approach her as a ""stranger"".  You get the idea.  Just a thought!"

&gt;The kicker was when I learned that he’s recently been borrowing money from his parents.

&gt;He didn’t know because he hasn’t spoken to them in several weeks. 

Kind of says it all. No he is not going to get better. You need to go out and meet new people.  Oh and do break-up with him. I am pretty sure he will be fine because his parents will take him back."

I wish we could hear the wife's POV, because I wonder if she would describe whatever's happening as ""scolding,"" or instead as something more abusive or controlling.

301,"I can think of a couple reasons why she might be acting like this, just off the top of my head, and I'm sure there are others.

1. Perhaps her protestations of ""Oh, no, I don't want anything"" were just polite lip service, and she really *did* want you to get her a gift, and she was upset that you did not.

2. Perhaps the reason for her protestations was because she didn't want you to spend money she thinks you can't afford, and donating to a charity is still money spent on her behalf when she specifically asked you not to spend money on her.

No one here can tell you what's going on in her head.  Only she knows.  And the only way to find out is to ask.

If you're OK not knowing, then let it go.  If you need to know, then ask her.  You could say something like ""Mom, when we told you that we had donated to a charity on your behalf, it seemed to upset you; it was not my intention to upset you, so I apologize, but I don't understand why what I did bothered you, and I would like to know why it did so I can avoid doing it again in the future.""

If she chooses to tell you, then there you go.  If she chooses not to, however, don't try to force it; it will serve no purpose other than to upset her further, and at that point you will have apologized, and it'll be up to her to get over it if she's still upset."
302,"It’s okay to be a little jealous when he’s intentionally doing things that anybody would have a problem with. Youre worried about being a nag. You’re the cool girlfriend. But he’s pushing his boundaries and he knows it. 

“Listen, I know you had a thing with Jane before because your friends told me. I think it’s a little messed up you never told me about this in the first place. It seems even weirder that you kept hanging out with her to this extent without talking to me about your history. She pushes her boundaries all the time and I’m not comfortable with it. You’re not respecting me or our relationship when you let her do those things. I feel like I’m a place holder until she decides she wants you. That’s not fair to me”

If he calls you jealous, he’s gaslighting you. He’s not a baby dude. He kept this information from you for a reason. He didn’t want to have a conversation about this. That’s it. He’s worried about making things easy for him "
303,"You have the power to change this dynamic.

As an independent adult, you have the biggest piece of leverage possible against him: your presence in his life.

You make it clear to him that every conversation with him that brings up your boyfriend or the fighting in a negative light, you will end it immediately. Whether by hanging up on him, or even getting up and leaving right in the middle of dinner.

Then make it clear to him that you will be having no contact with him after each incident. The first incident, one day. The second, one week. The third, two weeks. The fourth, a full month. Or however you would like to go about it.

But right now he behaves this way as a choice. Any consequences he suffers will be as a result of *his* choices.

You need to be sure to follow through on this plan if you want it to work."
304,"Hi, frequent poster on r/justnomil here and let me lay some groundwork for you on grandparents rights with a deceased partner. 

Cease all contact and visitations with them for the time being while you get your ducks in a row. Document all of their attempts at contact and save EVERYTHING. People who threaten their grandchild's parent do not deserve decency until boundaries are established.

In Colorado your inlaws do have a legal right to petition the court for VISITATION, not custody unless you are deemed unfit. You can bypass a lot of bullshit in the court system by actually having legal aid or an attorney draw up a preferred visitation schedule that works for you. The courts prefer mediation to multiple, drawn out hearings. However, I wouldn't do that until I've been subpoenaed by them because why bend over backwards for people who are making you feel shitty after you've experienced such a huge loss? Also, only agree to visitations if you trust them and do NOT give them any access to government information on your child (SS number, access to her birth certificate, etc.). Your comfort level and your daughter's happiness is key here so don't feel obligated to appease these people. 

Prepare for CPS immediately. Here's what they're going to be looking for: the amount of toddler friendly food in your fridge and cabinets, your milk/formula supply, your diaper and wipes supply, the cleanliness of your apartment, whether you have a proper, up to code carseat, whether your crib is still within safety guidelines, do you have baby gates to keep your daughter out of dangerous areas, is your apartment toddler proof, they will ask to inspect her body for bruises, rashes, and signs of molestation. If the initial visit goes well they usually close the case without much hubbub. But you demand a copy of the social worker's findings and all of his/her contact information in case your lawyer needs to subpoena the social worker to prove your fitness via a formal inquiry. 

So in conclusion: don't talk to them, but document everything they say to you and save everything. Hire a lawyer or consult legal aid so you have a formal visitation plan ready to go for family court as a compromise for mediation. But don't make the first move, make them spend their money to get this into the court system. Keep your apartment clean, stocked with food and toddler essentials, baby proof, and make sure all of your daughter's stuff is up to safety code. Request all copies of formal inquiries and investigations, as well as contact info for anyone sent to investigate you. 

Don't let assholes get you down.

And most importantly, take care of yourself and your daughter and good luck to you. "

306,"Do not beat yourself up for being justifiably concerned  Your husband intentionally sprang this on you at the last minute to avoid any discussion.

Make no  mistake,he's in the wrong.  He's allowed himself to get  inappropriately close to this co-worker and is in total denial about what he is up to -- which is essentially acting like a single dude pursuing another woman.

You and your husband need to get help right now.  You say this is just the latest example of his not  prioritizing you and other things are not going well for you.   See if you can find a counselor in town who takes patients on a sliding scale fee basis and get the ball  rolling.

310,"What a ride indeed. I concur. If your brother and sister feel strongly about giving your other sister a chance then let them. Be clear to them though that you do not want any contact with her, do not wish to hear about her or be pressured into visiting the community or church. She should also not know where you live, your number etc. You suffered too much to have to relive what you went through growing up. Your girlfriend is right. You are right. 


YOu need therapy if you dont mind me saying to be able to control your outbursts whenever you hear about your family or community. Its not healthy for you.

Unless there are time sensitive issues at hand, this does not seem like a good time to be getting engaged. You have barely been together, it has apparently not been under the best conditions during a big chunk of it, and you still have at least one massive unresolved issue.

I would really think about postponing this engagement if it's possible. Gives the two of you real time to actually hash out these issues."
312,"&gt;I'm the one feeding him, taking him out in the morning, taking him out several times during the day, taking him to the dog park, to the vet, spending hours training him, and was the one who woke up in the middle of the night during crate training.

&gt;I often feel like I have to ask my husband for any help and that he won't help on his own

The answer to your question is: yes, this is a good preview of what it will be like to have a child with him.

The good news is that this is also an *excellent* opportunity to figure all this shit out! It sounds like most of these puppy-chores are routine, scheduled things; sit him down and divvy up the routine tasks. He is no longer 'helping', he is now *responsible* for nighttime feeding and walk (or whatever). You may have to be willing to let him fail (and clean up puppy poop) a couple times. But this will also be an excellent opportunity to see whether he thinks it's appropriate to let a dependent creature go hungry a few hours because it's inconvenient or 'he forgot'. Sometimes (perfectly capable) people in relationships can get a bit lazy or default into roles with one person being more responsible than the other; see if a frank talk and explicitly reassigning responsibility will snap him out of this.

I also think you should be frank that how you two handle the puppy is directly influencing your comfort with having his kid. He should know what the stakes are."
313,You posted a few days ago about not contacting any of your friends for 46 days. You cut them off cold turkey for over a month and you keep wine under the table at dinner. Can you see why your friends might think something is up? Or why they may not be being especially kind?

323,"&gt; How would I find a custody lawyer? Is this really something that would need a lawyer? Can they really take her from me?
&gt; 
&gt; 

The American Bar Association--the licensing group for lawyers--has a referral directory. If you google ""American bar association lawyer referral,"" it will come up. You can search by state and it will direct you to various referral websites for your state. This can get a little bit confusing, so you may want to ask friends and family whether they have any recommendations or post over on /r/legaladvice with your location listed.

Grandparents rights' laws vary wildly from state to state. Your in-laws will not, under any circumstance, gain primary custody of your daughter. They may be able to gain visitation rights, but they will not be able to take your daughter from you entirely. You are not an unfit parent in any sense and your custody will not be revoked. This really sucks, but try not to panic too much. "

You could also talk about each having a “me” night once a week or other weekly/monthly mental health breaks. 

If you are annoyed that it’s a trip you already planned, maybe you could tell him that he is now responsible for planning a family trip to make up for it. 

Either way, your partner who you love is telling you he’s overwhelmed and needs a break. Instead of thinking about your own feelings in reaction to this, you should be in problem solving mode for him. At least think about compromises. "

Sounds like he got super butthurt that his friend was just trying to lock down some smoke for a bonfire, while also inviting you guys out. It’s no different (to those who smoke, I don’t) than asking guests to bring drinks or paper plates. Sheesh. 

He was very much out of line for how he treated you that night. Tell him his chill boyfriend card was revoked when he called you screaming. It went into negative territory when he emotionally blackmailed you (you’re a terrible partner if you don’t do what I want right this minute! Jump! And ask me how high!) and insisted you go to his place, and also stay on the phone with him berating you until you got in the car. (So you couldn’t tell anyone what was going on and have them tell you how crazy out of line he’s acting.) 

He owes you an apology, and you should be on alert for similar behavior. If this is a pattern of behavior from him—dump the asshole. "

I'm not saying you should dump him, but you should totally not let him trap you with a baby. "
345,"I agree OP has nothing to be ashamed of, but some people are unfortunately really shitty to people who’ve been abused, and it’s also fine if OP doesn’t want to share a personal and traumatic thing with people who aren’t her friends.

Please do make sure you have a safe place to stay, that you get medical treatment, and that you file a police report."
346,"&gt; Am I doing something wrong? Is she just a bad person? Is this a phase that will fade away on its own?

As a high school teacher and a parent of two teenagers I can answer some of these questions (I apologize for the length of my response).

**Is she just a bad person?**  NOT AT ALL.  She is a teenage girl and is behaving as a fairly typical teenage girl does. However, the added loss and grief of not having her mother around is bound to make her mood swings and antagonistic behaviour towards you worse. What is particularly difficult in your situation is the fact that you have to take on the role of a parent while she sees you as a sibling.  For example, the “Whoa hands off weirdo” comment when you hugged her in front of her friends. This is a typical comment that a younger sibling might say to an older one, but not one that you would expect from a daughter to a father. You play both roles so it makes the dynamics between you guys difficult.

**Is this a phase that will fade away on its own?**  Absolutely. As long as you play your cards right and don't let your hurt feelings and anger take over in your responses to her behaviour and attitude, you will see a marked improvement by the time she finishes high school. In my experience 15 is about as bad as it gets attitude wise.  

Finally: **Am I doing something wrong?** Maybe some things.  Parenting teenagers is difficult and all of us make mistakes along the way but I'm going to point out a few things that stood out to me from your post. The advice I am giving you is based on what has worked with my daughter, or with some of my students in similar scenarios, so keep that in mind since your family dynamic is unique.

First, I know it is hard, but try not let her cruel comments get to you. Respond to cruel things she says to you calmly by saying ""That was a cruel thing to say and I expect better from you. I am going to give you some space now and we can talk later when we are both more calm.""  Then leave to calm down before your emotions cause a situation to escalate. Either she will approach you later to apologize (best case) or you can approach her after a while to either calmly continue the conversation you were having or to continue on as normal if there is nothing further to discus. I usually approached my kid by saying ""I feel better now, how about you?"" in order to gauge their mood at that point and to ease the tension.

One thing I always made sure is that my kids knew that I was always 100% on their side. That if I ever had to discipline them, or say no to something they wanted, it was out of concern for their safety and well being. Part of being on their side included not embarrassing them in front of their friends and respecting that teenage peer relationships are important.  So, when you found your sister in her room with two boys, you reacted in a way that many would consider reasonable but that was not the most constructive in maintaining your sister safe and happy. You lost your temper, you kicked out her friends, you accused her of bringing strangers into YOUR home (as far she was concerned she was bringing friends into HER home), you told her that those boys were just looking to take advantage of her and belittled her in the process (""two idiots looking for any girl willing""), and then you told her the biggest piece of BS so many parents tell their kids, that any kid that makes fun of her is not worth being friends with.  This last bit, may seem like good advice from where you sit as an adult no longer in high school, but as a high school teacher I can tell you that a kid in the middle of high school does not see it that way.  To them being mocked by their peers is one of the worst things they can endure, and by dismissing her concern you are not showing her that you are on her side and that you care about her happiness (which I know you do).  

So what should you do if you find your teenage sister (or daughter) in such a situation?  First, do not lose your temper, swear, and kick the boys out in anger. Do, knock and ask to speak to her for a moment. Ask her to introduce her friends to you and have a quick casual chat with them. Tell them that you expect them to hang out in the living room or to keep the bedroom door open.  Make sure they know that you are hanging around and nearby at all times during the rest of the visit.  When they leave, ask her to sit down with you to talk. Calmly express that you are concerned by what you think may have been happening when you walked into the house (don't accuse her of anything - ask her if your assumptions are correct). Let her know that you are concerned that she was pressured or coerced by these boys. If she says that she wasn't then you can have a frank an honest discussion with her about what was actually happening. Is this a consensual relationship with two boys? Were they just goofing around and experimenting? How well does she know them? Is she concerned that they may gossip to others at school and how that may harm her reputation? The key is that she sees you as someone who is concerned for her health and well being. Not as someone who is willing to believe the worst about her in any given situation and who is not on her side.  Because as much as you may hate that she was in her room making out with two boys, there is nothing you can do to stop her from doing that in the future if that is what she wants to do. If, on the other hand, she was being coerced and the situation was not fully consensual, then you made it difficult for her to talk to you about it. 

It is not too late to address what happened. Approach her at a time when you are both calm and in a good mood. Maybe take her to dinner or something.  Start by apologizing for how you handled the situation and explain that you were shocked by what you saw and your fear and concern for her got the best of you.  Don't be afraid to be vulnerable and to let her know that you are finding it difficult to be both a parent and a brother but that you are trying and want to do better in the future. Let her know that you just want what is best for her. Ask her for her input on your relationship and how she feels about it. Maybe you can suggest seeing a family therapist together to help you guys find ways to work as a team.  Because ultimately, that is what she needs to know - that you are a team. 

Having said all that, I think that you are doing a good job raising your sister. I mean, she gets straight As, is polite to all adults (other than you maybe), is talented, athletic, intelligent. So she has a bit of an attitude - no kid is perfect. I'm sure many parents of teenagers are jealously reading your description of your sister. Other than a bit of sass and attitude, she is a great kid. So relax. Do work on how you communicate with her and it wouldn't go amiss to seek some family therapy to help you navigate the unique relationship you have and help you deal with the grief you must both still be feeling.  

Good luck OP. I hope this helps.

No you’re not. Refuse to see him ever again. Do not allow him into your home. If he persists outside the door, call the police. Text him right now and say, “I do not want to see you again. I am deleting you from all platforms and devices.” Then do it, and never respond to any communication from him ever again."
358,She owes you money to replace it then.
359,"Best thing you can do is stick to your guns about him moving out by Sunday. 

My jaw hit the floor about him saying that you're being immature - REALLY? He dopes it up, doesn't pay rent, gets lap dances and he's questioning your maturity? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!

He's not ""accepting"" the break-up because he has a good gig living with you. Please don't let it go on any longer.

I think you'll find that once he's out, you'll feel relief immediately. It's better to be alone for a while and recover from this relationship. Just remind yourself of all of the good rewards associated with him being gone."
360,"He firmly believes I can ""heal"". There is a slim chance, but highly unlikely. I told him it wasn't his place to determine."
361,"Please don't continue the cycle of abuse, OP. Just because she can't walk around doesn't mean she can't damage your children in the head (and heart)."
362,Absolutely. You can even force him to get a life insurance policy for the kids since he's ill.
363,"&gt; I know it sounds shallow but I always wanted my first child to be somebody else’s first child too and be a family with them

There is literally nothing shallow about that at all."
364,"From an outside perspective, you took an innocuous invitation to a professional lunch and made it weird by insinuating that such an interaction would necessarily have romantic undertones. I believe your view is outdated, sexist, and wrong, and that adults of opposite sexes can be professional regardless of setting. Speaking personally, I often have several lunches per week, and most are with members of the opposite sex...yet we somehow never end up doing anything inappropriate or disrespectful toward either individual's relationships. Go figure.

By telling Dwight the reason why you were declining his offer, you insinuated that his professional request had romantic undertones, which most likely caught him off guard (and made him ""defensive"" as you mentioned). Dwight is probably now worrying that anything he says or does will be misconstrued as an advance, which in today's professional world, could lead to harassment claims. That is why he has gone cold with you, because you low-key accused him of asking you on a date...when he wasn't asking you on a date.

Leave it alone. Talking further about it will only make it worse. In the future, do not tell people WHY you are declining a lunch request with them, lest they think you are accusing them of impropriety."
365,I got $10 on it that she's not even there. Any takers?
366,When you let a crush build for months it just sets up the relationship for failure.  Even if they agree to go on a date or keep dating you it's as if you started the race with an hours headstart.  Realistically they won't catch up and it puts them on guard.  
367,"Holy shit dude.  It's like you stuck your head into an alligators mouth and it bit you.  Now your bleeding profusely, almost decapitated, and are here brainstorming under what conditions you should stick your head back in.  All while chastising the alligator about how there need to be ""consequences"".

Get the fuck away from the alligator, dude."
368,Why are you with her? Reading all your comments she sounds so disrespectful!!
369,"If she mentions wanting to copy yours again, maybe try turning it into a joke to make others around laugh so she'll see how ridiculous she's being.

370,"Other commenters have the legal process steps covered here, but I'll just add that your primary focus at this time should not be trying to figure out why this happened, or contemplating if you are at fault (you are not).

371,"&gt; She is not a judgmental or self-righteous Catholic. 

Isn't this whole post about her being judgmental and self-righteous?  That's sure how I read it.  

&gt; How can I bring this up to her without straining our healthy relationship? 

Recognize that *she's the one straining the relationship* by imposing her rules on you.  "
372,"I'd throw her out of my life for being a disrespectful git, but that's just me"
373,"He should see a doctor if this is a new thing.  Generally people do not go 58 years without squealing and suddenly start.

Other theory: he is doing one long psych 101 study on your family to measure their discomfort."
374,"&gt;Today she posts this meme saying “when you pay all bills instead of going half half... oh you a mannn mannn

To be honest, this bothers me more than her skewed view of a marital partnership.  The fact that she would try to shame you by attacking your manhood is very off putting.  Does she try to manipulate you about other things by implying that you aren't a ""real man"" unless you do what she wants?"
375,"It’s totally fair that you ghosted him; he sounds like a toxic shit. Maybe sending an email would be the better way to go, if you need that closure. Otherwise just block any lines of communication and let him suffer. "
376,This sounds like dementia. Earlier on in my grandfather's decline he started hissing at things. If he hasn't been to the doctor about it he should consider it. Unfortunately if it is dementia it may be harder to get him to stop: my grandad only stopped when he became less verbal. 
377,"&gt;If you are annoyed that it’s a trip you already planned, maybe you could tell him that he is now responsible for planning a family trip to make up for it.

I like that idea. A lot of commenters are missing that he just uninvited her from a trip she was already supposed to go on. That would upset me more than my SO going on a trip without me. "
378,"If you have any doubts, ANY at all, do not stay.

And if you decide to break up with him over this, do it in public. In a place where there would be lots of witnesses. With 911 on speed dial. During the day."
379,He will destroy his relationship with your children if he doesn't fix this.  They will see you as an enabler.  You need to get this fixed before youre on here posting about how your children refuse contact with you. 
380,"Do you live with your dad?

If not, I'd suggest that you put him into ""time out"". When a child misbehaves, they need someone to put a form foot down, and that's exactly what your father is right now - a child.

Let him know that until he apologizes to the fighter he was trying to beat up, and until he respects both your career and your partner's career, he's in relationship time out.

No calls, no visits, just time out.

Edit: also, you should think about having the police criminally trespass him from the dojo or wherever you work. If his behavior escalates, he won't be allowed on your company property."
381,"I mean...I don't think she's your girlfriend anymore, from what I'm reading here. ""Talking here and there"" is not a relationship."
382,"""Mom, fiancé and I decided that we'd like to meet our new baby before we introduce him/her to the rest of the family. It's going to be a really special and private moment for us as a new family. We'd still love for you to be there to meet her/him after I've given birth.""

That's really all you need to say. If you feel like you need to say more, then just don't make it about her. This moment is about you, your fiancé, and the kid you're bringing into this world. Focus on that, rather than her. 
"
383,"You can actually find free PDFs of that book online. 

But yeah your BF seems unhinged and dangerous. Your best bet is to text/email him that you are breaking up with him and he is not to contact you again. You know how he reacts in person so don’t do this face to face for your own safety. After you’ve said your piece *immediately* take a screen shot of your break up/no contact message then and block him. Don’t let him get a word in because you know that he’s going to try and insult and bully you back into the relationship just like last time. 

Next steps after the breakup:

* Save the breakup screen shot as evidence that you told him to never contact you (in case you ever need to pursue a restraining order). 

* You should change your locks and ALL your passwords (email, social media, bank, etc) just in case he knows them. 

* Block him in all social media. You will probably need to block his friends and family members too as they can pass along info about you to him. 

* Lock down your social media. Set everything to private so that only friends can see your info. Don’t accept random friend requests and double check with people you know if you receive a friend request from them that the request actually came from them (to make sure it’s not your BF with a fake account). 

* If/when he tries to contact you post-breakup DON’T EVER respond, ANY response from you will encourage him to keep trying. Instead document the time, date, method of contact (text, email, letter, showed up at your location, etc), and what was said. Keep a screenshot or recording along with the documentation. Make sure you have backups of this information in multiple locations. This record can be taken to the police to pursue a restraining order if needed. 

* If he shows up at your home DON’T let him inside or even open the door. He is dangerous and you don’t know what he’ll do if he gets you alone. Tell him through the locked door that he is trespassing and he needs to leave. If he doesn’t leave after the first warning call the police and tell them “My EX is outside my front door and he refuses to leave. We had a nasty breakup and I am scared for my safety. Please send help.”

* DON’T ever go somewhere alone with this man as he has shown that he is willing to go to extreme lengths to control you, you don’t know what he is actually capable of. Don’t ever get into his car. If he tries to force you to go with him fight, yell, scream, bite, scratch- do anything to attract attention and to make it difficult for him to move you. 

* If he finds you in public don’t be afraid to cause a scene, if he approaches and you can’t easily avoid him loudly tell him “leave me alone!” Keep repeating it over and over, getting louder and louder, to the point of yelling if you need to. Never be afraid to ask for help from security/employees. 

* Tell friends and family that your EX is abusive and unstable. For your safety they are NEVER to tell him of your whereabouts, how to contact you, pass messages along for him, or give him information about your life. You may also need to let your work know what is going on so you can have a plan in place if he shows up there. "
384,"What's Ann's deal? Your boyfriend must make the company a bunch of money or they must be a super social group because I would be weirded out if someone AT WORK planned a surprise party for me, didn't include my SO and talked to my mom around my SO. I too would feel left out and irritated with Ann. On top of all that you can't talk to your boyfriend about this or it will ruin the surprise :("
385,"You should look up voluntourism. (Not sure I spelled it right but also not a real word). There multiple think pieces floating around the internet that kind of express what you are feeling. Basically that a lot of the "" go to Africa and help the poor people"" is more for the people doing the helping than the communities they are supposed to be ""helping"". These organizations rarely make an actual difference but often just help people from privileged nations feel good about them self. 

If she, and you, really want to do good look at volunteering in your local community. There is a lot of need for volunteers locally, no matter where you live. "
386,"Hire a cleaner to ride this out til her residency ends. People really only have a finite amount of ""giving a shit"" per day and if she's working 12 hours a day she's probably tapped out. Yes, even for ""just 15 minutes"" of cleaning. "
387,"I feel like you are not giving a full picture.  Why don't her friends like you?  What happened when you argued to make them say she should divorce you?  What did she do to make you say she treats you unfairly?  There's clearly a problem between you two but it's not clear what that problem is.  


I agree that her friends are not the issue -- focus on what is happening between you and your wife.  "
388,"&gt;  I reached out to our mutual friends (all men) to ask if they knew he had a girlfriend and they were all uncomfortable and were like, 'Yeah, Jeff has told us you've been totally crazy and stalking him but we didn't know what to say since it seemed personal, he asked us not to say anything to you.' I'd been talking to them casually about flirting with Jeff all summer too so I probably did look crazy (just normal things, like when they asked if I'd been dating anyone, I'd say, 'Well, Jeff and I kind of hit it off at the art show and we're seeing how things go"" etc).

I mean these people don't sound like decent friends either if I'm being honest. Either they knew he had a GF and were letting you become emotionally involved without telling you or they think you are a crazy stalker.

Neither is a good look. "
389," I didn’t think of this. If this really is the case, it’s really sad. Imagine not wanting/being able to go to your own sisters wedding because you’re too ashamed of yourself and then having her cut you off to boot. "
390,"I totally agree.  It is one thing to not have life skills, it is another to take advantage of people, which is what she is doing to your family now.  She’s not incompetent, she just doesn’t care.  Huge difference.

It is time for some tough love on your part or why should she change?  Right now you’re giving her a free ride."
391,"Not telling you about a kid for the first few dates wouldn't be a big deal.  Not telling you for 15 months is an enormous red flag.  

It's not just the lie, but the fact that she's capable of maintaining a lie for so long AND only admitted the extent of the lie(s) under intense questioning.  If she's capable of this kind of manipulation, what else is she capable of?

At any rate, she's lost ALL trust you had in her.

Leave."
392,HE PULLED A KNIFE ON SOMEONE. HE THINKS HE WAS RIGHT TO DO THIS. Don’t stick around and risk it happening to you.

I'm assuming there won't be any issues if I file for unemployment during this time that would otherwise have been my notice period.""    Let HR know that your boss has retaliated and that you know your rights.  

I would totally file for unemployment.  The only thing they can do is contest it,  but you have a good case for it.  It's a few hundred dollars probably but that'll pay your electric bill and get you some groceries.

&amp;#x200B;"
394,[removed]
395,"Yeah. And another red flag to me especially was this:

&gt; He went out again, didn't get me crackers again because someting pissed him off on the way (he gets pissed off easily).  

Really? He couldn't even remember to do the one thing you asked for because he let his own pissy emotions get in the way? Not spending all day with you is one thing, but a partner should be there for their partner and at least do the bare minimum."
396,"&gt;When there are no problems in our lives, everything is perfect and we have amazing time with lots of fun. However, **whenever I have a problem, she just disappears**

Being empathetic and supporting your partner when they need someone to lean on is a *bare bones* requirement in a relationship. Life sucks and shit happens, and everyone on the planet needs someone who can be there for them when the chips are down, and if they're in a relationship that role should absolutely be filled by their partner. She can't or won't do that for you.

It sounds like she's not invested in this relationship at all. It's been 3 years, do you really think she's going to drastically change? Either accept that you're spending the rest of your life with a partner who makes the term partner an oxymoron, or leave and find someone who's actually interested in you beyond when things are sunshine and roses."
397,"Her feelings are her responsibility and I really can’t see a single thing you did to create this situation. It’s not really your problem to fix.

That said, I think you took the most helpful approach in offering to give her some general direction for the wedding, even though she didn’t take you up on it.

This is a “can lead a horse to water but can’t make her drink” situation. You can offer again, and maybe offer more concrete advice (e.g. give her a list of venues / caterers / whatever that you think she’d like to pick from). But this is sort of a slippery slope into planning her wedding, which you already told us you don’t want to do."
398,"You should break up with him immediately.

This immature emotionally abusive piece of shit has so red flags through the roof that they can supply a small communist country.

Screw his need for constant validation. The nerve of him to nonchalantly introduce marriage paperwork without even properly talking to you about it, let alone proposing. The blaming of your longtime roomate is such BS that there ain't enough Febreeze to get the smell out.

Maybe he was initially nice, but now he's starting to show his true colors and the last thing you need is for him to isolate you by having you move in with him.

Next he'll be wanting to go through your phone.

He's definitely not worth it, and he's definitely not ready. You're both so young. And he doesn't have his shit together. "
399,"&gt; I casually said ""she sounds cool, I'd love to meet her!"" and he quickly responded with ""ah, you two definitely should not meet""

Understandable. It rarely goes well when your girlfriends meet up.

It's only been six months. Personally, I'd be out."
400,"This is abusive behavior by her. This is absolutely exhausting for you.

Try and look at this objectively: how absurd is it that you can't even feel safe talking about your commute home to your partner because she'll find a way to accuse you of cheating?? This level of jealousy is unbearable and unfair. 

This isn't some little fixable flaw for her. This isn't something that will go away. This isn't something you can fix. This will take years of therapy and personal reflection for her to get out of this shitty mindset, and that's only if she recognizes what she's doing as a problem, which I guarantee she won't. Either way, this relationship has no happy ending for you. You need to cut your losses and leave this person before she destroys you."
401,"At this point it's the principle of the thing. If it's ""no big deal"" and ""just food"" then why the fuck can't she make her own meals, and make some for you sometimes too while she's at it? After all, it's a non-issue according to her so she should jump at the opportunity, right? Not to mention you're consistently paying for food she's devouring.

You're not her live-in chef, you're not her parent prepping her meals, they're meant for you. It's not even a once in awhile thing, it's regularly and she's completely dismissing how you feel about it and trying to paint you as the asshole in this scenario when she's the inconsiderate one.

""Look, at this point it's just as much about you respecting my boundaries as it is about the food. I make that food for myself, I'm trying to lose weight, I look forward to a meal when I come home. From now on, either ask me in advance to cook enough to prep for you or start buying and preparing your own meals. You can think it's stingy, but I'm not the one eating your stuff. I need you to hear me on this.""

End of story. What's she going to do, throw a tantrum and break up with you because you wouldn't let her gobble your food?"
402,"Make a new email that nobody knows about, and email these screenshots there.

403,"Why is he living at home with you guys if he has money? At this point, you're only enabling his behavior by letting him live in your house. Honestly, this sounds as much of a problem with your husband as it is with your son and until you get on the same page with your husband on how to deal with your son, he will continue playing you guys off of each other. 

At this point, you should be charging him rent for living with you guys and you should set some standard rules for him living in the house (contribute to the household, no smoking in the house, etc.). But, to do that, you and your husband need to get on the same page first."
404,"I have never, ever experienced, seen, or even heard about bruising lips from kissing until now. That is insane. My first thought would be to ask him if he got punched. Am I crazy? "
405,"I think this is a form of negging.  I don't think he means it as a compliment.  He wants you to feel like you need to go above and beyond all the time or he's going to walk away.  Personally, I think you should walk away first."
406,Exactly what you think it means. 
407,"&gt;  that resentment is a-brewing.


I think it's fully brewed."
408,She's jealous. And it's the weirdest jealousy I've ever seen. She's set a standard for herself that she doesn't even want to live up to.
409,"OP, you seem like a bystander in your own life.  You need to decide what you want and then take measures to get there.  It is ok to set boundaries for your wife's contact with another man that is obviously way beyond just a platonic friend.  This is not controlling behavior.  Just because your wife stood by you during past fuck-ups doesn't mean it's ok to just stand by and let her decide the course of this relationship.   And by the way, a therapist who says to conceal this important relationship type stuff from you is an idiot.  You've stated you don't want couples counseling but you definitely need it.  You need something beyond what appears to be an astonishing amount of complacency.  If I've misread the situation, correct me.  I hope I'm wrong."

I don't know if that'd get a better reaction, but maybe worth trying, since body language is harder to respond to verbally.  I mean, they're morons so they'll probably still say something to each other, but might cut down on your interaction with them. "
414,"What the what. The guys at my job whose wives and girlfriends have no clue what happens in our industry, are always at functions. I would never go as a coworkers +1 to an event, even if we were both single. It's so unprofessional imho.

 Is there anything else he does where he brushes your feelings off?"
415,Break up with him. His behavior was totally out of line. And feeling insecure about you being with eight people instead of six?? And one of those was an ASSAULT? He sounds disgusting.

420,"If you’re in the US and he’s worked for your company long enough, I’d bring up FMLA. I have anxiety/panic disorder and have paperwork in with HR (and my boss) where if I need to leave because I can’t reign in the panic, it’s covered under FMLA even if I don’t have sick/vacation time. I can’t be penalized for having to leave suddenly. Knowing that actually helps keep the anxiety episodes down since I’m not adding worry over being fired, because I’m acting “irrationally”. 
Knowing that you understand and don’t think poorly of him will go MILES in helping I would think. "
421,It sounds like hubby is mad about something else 
422,You all need to be more respectful. These things don’t sound like one-offs. You say you don’t leave food out and yet... you absolutely do. You literally hung out laundry on a string of lights instead of taking your roommates clothes to their beds. How hard is it to hang up a jacket or put dry dishes away? Your post is all over the place and I think the fact that you don’t realize it makes it seem like y’all are just not self aware at all.
423,"I’d be concerned that he turned down a fair split for rent/expenses and is now using that against you. 

I would be *pissed* about the groceries since it’s not just the cost of the groceries—it’s the planning, the shopping, the cooking. Clearly it’s more than just the cost or he wouldn’t be ordering out while you’re not feeling well.

426,"She sounds exhausting. I bet she's one of those people that doesn't have a filter which, as you pointed out, comes of as very abrasive and shows a lack of introspection and frankly a lack of respect for other people. I'm not sure there's anything you can do about it though as it is a personality trait that unless she recognizes it won't change. Seems like she's always in a courtroom mentality and not aware that life outside doesn't need her defense/prosecution all the fraking time. For what is worth, I don't think you did anything wrong with your child. "
427,"Do not buy a house or get married until there is a firm decision on this. This is one of the big talks that couples should have before getting married as it can create a lot of drama when you don't agree. Has FIL even looked into what it would take from an immigration point of view to bring MIL to the US? Will you/your bf provide sponsorship for that? your FIL won't be able to if he doesn't have a job that pays above the poverty line. What kind of a job is he hoping to get? Not many people work at his age in the US and those are usually grocery store jobs that don't pay enough. What about health insurance, do they have it in their country? will they be able to afford it here, or are they eligible for Medicare, your MIL is probably not. There is a lot more to it than just moving and I think your bf needs to have that conversation with your future in-laws. If he wants to help support his parents that money should come from his own money, not your joint account, and I say this as an immigrant supporting my family in my home country. "
428,Thank you.
429,"Oof. I know it's not helpful, but I have to wonder why you guys got married in the first place if you were on such polar opposite ends of the spectrum. One of you is always going to be unhappy with the level of affection, and it sounds like that's been him for a very long time and now he thinks he's finally ""cracked"" you.

Because you have a kid, I'll say to try couples counseling, but honestly I'm like your husband and I would absolutely wither in a relationship where the physical affection was as rare and perfunctory as you want it. I hope you guys can figure it out.

I also want to say you're not a horrible person, your needs just differ vastly from your husband's."
430,"So you’re telling me that, after telling her no, your girlfriend violated your trust and privacy by trying to get into your password manager without your authorization? If this were a stranger, would you be so cavalier about this giant red flag/breach of trust? 


&gt;very important documents including bank account info, highly protected work login keys

So she’s not just risking your security and data, but also your job. I know it’s highly job/company dependent, but allowing someone else to access your work logins is absolutely a fireable offense at every company I’ve worked for.

If she were just nagging/fighting about the passwords, I wouldn’t be saying this, but trying to access your passwords illicitly is 100% a break up worthy offense. I don’t think you can compromise with someone who has already proven themselves untrustworthy to this level. She has no respect for your “no” and I would personally find that intolerable."

433,"It's going to be really hard for you to move forward without talking to him about this.

I can only imagine how awful it must be to read that list, but know that  I think it's normal to at least THINK about those things (I've never written anything like that down).  They're just bullet points (at least the version you provided)... so there could be a whole range with any given thing he wrote, like ""manipulative"" could really mean ""there was that one time she said/did X and I felt like it was a little bit manipulative""... it doesn't have to mean ""she's such an inherently manipulative person.""  So try not to beat yourself up over any single item.  


The high risk of cheating could just be his own insecurities shining through... you're beautiful, intelligent, and 10 years younger.  That could be all on him, and zero reflection of who you are.  


Do you have any indication of when he wrote it?  Maybe it was early on when he was still figuring out who you were/are as a person... he might disagree w/ some/all of what he wrote at this point.  


I think it will just continue to eat you up inside if you don't talk to him about it.  


Good luck w/ whatever you decide."

435,"You can get unemployment for those two weeks, but that's about it"
436,"Him saying, ""Every time you ask just pushes it further back"" is really assholish and manipulative. You need to have a serious talk with this guy - and not just about marriage. It needs to be about the kid issue, too. You say you're on the fence - but I'm betting that you're tending towards the the ""I'd like to have kids"" side of the fence, but maybe you're afraid of saying it because that'd just be another reason for the relationship to blow up. Either way, *now* is the time to have some conversations, and do some thinking of your own. If he doesn't want kids, or he's like ""well, maybe someday"", then you need to make sure that you're okay with never having kids if you stay with this guy. But it's definitely time to shit or get off the pot, what with your biological clock and all."
437,Thanks your words have made me more aware of what I need to do. I was being hesitant but like you mentioned I need to speak up. I'm not sure if my school code covers unwanted advances but I will reach out to my instructors today.
438,"&gt; I’ve heard of people from 3rd world countries doing this

I studied abroad in Spain &amp; they do this there. It’s because the plumbing there is very old (designed before modern toilet paper was a consideration) &amp; therefore just can’t handle it. I’m telling you this so you understand it’s not just something that happens in poor countries, so that doesn’t accidentally come across as subtext in your discussion with your roommate. 

Editing based on some very offended people below. Seville, the specific city I studied in, has a vast array of internet advice that you not flush toilet paper. It was also my experience while I was there, as I was specifically told not to flush TP. I do not speak for every toilet in the entire country. "
439,"This person is not a good friend- you told him the situation and he elected not to join when he could have, and then made a huge scene when he didn't get special treatment. I'd respond to the group text and say ""dude, I gave you a chance to join my friend's table beforehand and you said no- it wasn't my table to let you into. Can we let this go?"" "
440,"Yes, this is the answer. You absolutely don't play this game. 

Simply reply, ""Okay guys, have a great Thanksgiving! We'll catch up another time.""

They made the decision, they get to live with it. They are expecting you to feel guilty, beg, bend to their wishes, even though it's YOUR life and you're not a child anymore. 

So you either do what they want - which is unfair and if you do, you will be stuck doing what they want forever - or you shrug it off and say okay, no problem.

441,You need to head over to /r/childfree -- I think that subreddit is way better equipped to answer your questions. My suspicions personally? He didnt take your stance seriously and thought you'd somehow come along during your evolving relationship. That he could convince you. The tubal destroys that and makes him irrationally angry. I'd ditch him. You only lost 6 months. Some people have to find out they got played years into the relationship 
442,"""Hey, there was a misunderstanding. When I said you could use my fridge, I meant only that you could use my fridge SPACE, that you could put your food in there is there was room. But the food I keep in there isn't up for grabs - it's all stuff I need, so I can't share it. If you could replace the X, Y, and Z that you ate before the end of the week, that would be great. Otherwise you can just reimburse me and I'll shop for it."""
443,"You two need to get into couples therapy immediately. This is one of those situations where both of your unexamined assumptions have collided in a spectacular way.
"
444,"OP, first of all, it seems that you might be feeling some shame about what happened to you (hence the making yourself throw up and not wanting to tell your family).  Just remember that you did nothing wrong.  You trusted people who you thought were your friends and understood and respected your beliefs around alcohol and they betrayed that trust.  You have nothing to blame yourself for; you were quite literally drugged against your will.  Your right to decide what goes into your body was violated and that is a truly evil thing to do to another person.  God is merciful and just.  Neither He nor anyone else will hold this against you.

As for what to do about your friends, it seems like A and B were both in on it.  I would tell them that they violated your trust and showed disrespect for your religious beliefs in such a horrible way that your friendship can never recover.  C seems like a decent sort so I'd reach out to him, make sure he knows you don't blame him and see if you can continue a friendship with him separate from the other two.  Eventually you may find it helpful to talk to your parents or a religious leader about what happened, but that's your decision if and when to do that."
445,"I like this one the best out of all the comments. 

She’s an adult making choices and decisions. We all make mistakes, especially as young adults. Just be supportive and available to talk. I didn’t feel like I had anyone to talk and I made some really bad choices. "
446,"I’m angry AF right now, too. Your lawyer will get him out, OP. He will be paying child support &amp; alimony. She doesn’t have to worry about having a great job today. This fucker needs to pay. "
447,"Ok, I was expecting an occasional weed or MDMA consumer. 

This guy is waaaay further than that. Tell her. "
448,"Not that I disagree but making blanket statements about what is or isn't enjoyable seems like a disingenuous thing.

There are people who enjoy being pooped on."
449,Dude is 50 and he’s asking his parent for money still? You are 35 and you can do wayyyyy better
450,"I wanted to add my two cents here. I was like OP my parents divorced when I was 13 and I agreed with the divorce but I was immature and voiced my displeasure at my mom dating anyone else throughout my teen years. I’m in my 30s and my mom is still alone. I regret it so much seeing my mom by herself like she missed her chance because of me. 

Your dad will always place you first, always. But is it fair to ask him to be alone? Is your father gonna ask you to be alone because he is alone? I think not. Think about the future and not the present."
451,"It sounds like he got defensive at being criticized and is generally a man-baby who needs to grow up. You mention that he doesn't have many other caring friends and refuses to date- I wonder if he feels a) he can bribe you into spending time with him by offering these things, and then can continue the experience of hanging out by demanding something of you in return or b) he gets taken advantage of by other friends who use him for his connections and then disappear "
452,This doesn’t seem like a jealousy issue to me. It seems likes your husband is genuinely being pretty shitty.  
453,"Ok. First a warning that I’m socially awkward and that I’ve dealt with weight loss, loose skin, and the body image issues that generally go along with it. So I think I can at least sympathize with you. That being said, your facetious throwaway line?  I’d legit use it. “Hey, Boyfriend, I have a confession to make. It’s embarrassing to me and I don’t want to talk about it AT ALL, You know my giant fupa that we don’t talk about? Yeah, I’m getting the fat sucked out of it, deal with it. Quietly.  Because I’m serious, I don’t want to talk about it. Please carry on with your regularly scheduled life.”

I have literally used this method to announce my own insecurity-laced “stuff” to my SO. It’s worked out pretty well for me. "
454,"She just has no consideration when it comes to shared food. Like I think she sees something in the fridge and thinks it’s a free for all. She’s also taken like random things like brownies I baked for a friend to her OWN friends. When I asked her she was like what’s the big deal I just took some brownies leftover in the fridge. 

No I do most if not all of the cooking. "
455,"Take your emotional cap off and put your practical cap on.

What needs to be done to finalise this? 

Has she got a key? Ask for it back and spend some time today looking into changing your locks just in case.

Has she got things in your house? Find some bags and boxes, box it all up and have it ready for her.

Any shared finances or plans booked? Cancel anything and consider refunding her anything she's paid for (optional).

Make it real for yourself and for her. Consider asking her to meet at her apartment, drop the stuff off and after you tell her it's over, *leave*. "
456,"Good work getting out. It will get easier. Please start by contacting domestic abuse shelters in your area, they will be able to provide you with resources.

Edit: What your boyfriend did is called Reproductive Coercion. It is a form of abuse designed to make it more difficult for the abuse victim to leave."
457,"Your family is seriously toxic if you think they’re going to ignore your uncle trying to have sex with you. You need to cut him off. Never be alone with him. Don’t go anywhere he is. Keep the evidence, don’t delete anything. And block him. "
458,"As a Canadian, it's kind of funny to imagine the idea that living in the US right now is more desirable than living in Canada....perhaps you can turn that into a joke to spit back at them?  


Beyond that, this sounds like people that are picking up on your happiness and are deliberately trying to knock you off your perch.  Google crabs in the bucket for a more thorough description of this mentality.  The reality is, you can choose how much you want to let this bother you.  Instead of letting it ruin your happy moments, every time you feel those feelings creeping in, consciously think ""fuck it, let them be jealous if they want to be.  Doesn't change the truth.""  "
459,"You need to stand up for your fiance. If they insult his intelligence, defend him. Maybe suggest anything work related be off limits during meals so that *everyone* can participate in discussion. It's not very welcoming of them to talk about topics they know he isn't into. Maybe talk to your parents privately about how you're disappointed they have not made an effort to try to get to know their daughter's partner, someone she cares for deeply. "
460,"Maybe the two of you are just not compatible after all. That's ok.

Otherwise, maybe Saturdays doing your thing, Sundays doing his, and see how that goes."
461,"I'll be honest that I might end a friendship over this. A lot would depend on the context - length of friendship, history, etc., but telling you the day before is bad form. And there can be a million reasons why she didn't tell you sooner, but the end result is the same and it has a direct negative effect on your life. With that said, being in an unhappy roommate situation is an absolute nightmare, so at least she told you before you moved in, which could have been far worse.  

I would ask her to reimburse you for the trailer. If she agrees, then that's taking a certain amount of responsibility for her actions and the friendship is probably salvageable if you want it to be. If she doesn't, it's probably a relationship I would break off. 

And I think if you want to go low contact/no contact for a while, or even end the friendship regardless, that's not unreasonable. Ultimately, only you know whether this one action cancels out the value she brings to your life in other ways. "
462,"It sounds like you enjoy having a “harem” of single men around you. Do you feel most comfortable when you’re the only girl and get all the attention? 

Not gonna lie, it’s a really unhealthy way to be. I would definitely recommend speaking with a professional about the underlying issues that cause you to feel this way. If you express these feelings it absolutely will have a negative effect on all your relationships.

One of my close friends is like you in this way. She has several behavioural issues stemming from her wanting to be the centre of attention all the time, especially with men. She’s been in therapy for a year, and it has really helped her so far. "
463,"&gt;Then she starts talking about how she loves me but a part of her wants to go out of her way to hurt me

Well then the two of you shouldn't be dating. It's pretty straightforward.

You've been dating eight months and only see each other on weekends? This may be your longest relationship but it doesn't add up to all that much time spent together and it sounds like a fair bit of that time hasn't been good. Just cut your losses."
464,"&gt; She has told us that she found this disturbing but “what could she do if he’s in love with me”

She could do the same thing any respectful, non-predatory adult does when a minor says they have feelings for you - thank them (if you want), then politely yet firmly tell them no.

It’s beyond inappropriate for a 22yo to be dating someone just barely in high school. But what’s even more gross is how she perceives her own actions here.

She’s acting like she has no agency. Like if a 16yo boy wants to pursue her, she has *no choice* but to reciprocate. A 22yo woman, just “going along with” the desires of a horny 16yo boy.

The truth is, unless she’s being sexually assaulted, coerced, or manipulated (which it sounds like is not at all the case here), she is an *active participant* in this relationship. She is making the conscious choice to pursue a sexual encounter with a 16yo boy.

In your shoes, I would write an email/txt/letter detailing exactly why you find this messed up. And if she reads your words, yet continues to be sexually involved with this boy, I would just cut her from your life.

You don’t want to be associated with someone who would consciously make such gross and short-sighted life choices."
465,"Right, OP must be made of steel if she can observe him doing this without laughing."
466,"I've been in this type of situation before, on both sides actually.    
My advice to you is to get other people on her life to help you out on sending her the message that she needs to take care of herself. It's complicated hearing this sort of thing from your SO, 'cause it might feel like they are being unsupportive, but when other people such as parents or siblings say it, it is a different perspective. My family was crucial in getting me out of some tough times. If she has a family or close relatives of the sort, you should probably ask them for some help (assuming that she has a healthy relationship with them, that is). Also, it takes some of the toll off of you. No one should be the sole caretaker of their SO. "
467,"Why are you worrying about logistics when he clearly wants you to hire a catering company to handle the food? You just pick the menu and they make it happen. 

You’re not being lazy. You just didn’t think of a semi-obvious option. "
468,"I agree OP will regret it if they move in permanently.  There may be issues over placement of furniture, arrangement of kitchen, cooking, cleaning, what you spend your money on, having guests over, what time you go to sleep, how much noise you or they make, asking to go out with you all the time or complaining you’re gone by yourselves and finally, how to raise kids.  There are families where this can work out harmoniously and well but it doesn’t sound like you’ve worked out any details or boundaries. And your fiancé doesn’t seem to want to set any with them. "
469,[deleted]
470,"This is what I want to do, because I'm so embarrassed and also angry that our mutual friends would believe something like that about me. But I'm afraid that it'll just make me look 'crazy' for carrying on with it."
471,"Get into therapy ASAP this will hurt like hell but you need to end it with this woman and focus on taking care of yourself right now, not her. She’s in the hospital the best place she can be for help now it’s your turn to get some support "
472,Absolutely. I think he got used to me being around all day everyday.
473,"You aren’t the one who should feel embarrassed. There’s nothing you could have done that would justify what he did to you. 

Are you safe right now? "
474,"""you're not wrong, but you're kind of an a-hole"""
475,"&gt;I'm now 46 years old, never got to get married, never got to have kids, and have been 'playing house' for 20 years

I mean, it's not too late to get married? It might be too late for biological kids, but not for surrogacy or adoption or step kids or whatever. At 46 you've probably got 3 or 4 more decades to spend on this planet, why are you focussing on things you ""never got to do"" when you have so much time left to do them? Your life's not over yet.* You want a husband? Go out and get one. People twice your age get married these days. Don't waste another 20 years feeling unfulfilled.


*in my comment I'm assuming you don't have a terminal illness or massively shortened life expectancy for some reason, if you do then my advice doesn't apply and I'm sorry "
476,Right? I nearly cried. OP deserves dinner! 
477,"He's tenured. I don't think the school would do anything since he isn't her professor and I think my relationship with my daughter would suffer great if I did that. I think your second suggestion is what I'm leaning toward. If I'm totally ""ok"" with it, maybe the tabboo will be gone. "
478,"Yes, you should be worried. It means that your GF condones and enables cheating. It also suggests that your GF is one opportunity short of cheating one you.

I would also suggest that who you associate with reflects on who you are morally as well. By extension, you end up being complicit in the cheating.

In your shoes, I would be strongly considering

1. breaking up with my GF, because I am disgusted with her values, and
2. telling the fiancé that he is being cheated on."
479,Yeah i thought that too. Her roommates first message wasn’t bad. Not great but not awful. Then OP comes in rude and passive aggressive af so as a reaction her roommate becomes passive aggressive. I also like how OP then continues on to say how she’s only been polite to this roommate. I guess OP has a different definition of polite. 
480,"1st off I hope you're defending him, someone shouldn't even be comfortable telling you "" well, if he had a brain it would be easier” let alone actually following through and saying it. But be honest with yourself, how comfortable are you that you more than likely will have significantly less (forgive me if I'm wrong) financially than you're family? If you look deep inside and it IS in issue resentment will slowly build, but if you're comfortable being the bread winner and you have someone that loves you unconditionally and is good for you, just tell them you're engaged &amp; set some boundaries. Best of luck."
481,"100000% cheating. He lied about talking to her and going to see her, and she LITERALLY said you LITERALLY already d'd me "
482,"Seriously! I'd never thought of it like that but he totally is just complimenting HIMSELF while having sex! I almost feel like I'm just there to give external validation. He'd get the same satisfaction from his hand (and a fucking mirror).

Edit, also I forgot to mention that we sext occasionally, well it's more like he sends dick pics, but he will comment shit like ""Gotta say I'd go gay for a dick like this"" and it just makes me... ehhhh nope. Ya know? Wtf?"
483,"&gt; They told me I need to be with someone who ""treats me like a princess"" and makes me feel special and cared about. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're unhappy you should definitely leave. However, be careful of the above mindset. You absolutely deserve to be with someone who cares about you and makes you feel special, but if you demand to be put on a pedestal in every relationship you could find yourself asking why you can't find a good man 10+ years from now.

&amp;#x200B;"
484,"It would burn me too, but hit it from another perspective ... your grandparents are going to be so proud of you and they are going to be so happy for your brother that he seems to have a smart and hardworking wife. Just imagine the satisfaction of seeing your grandchildren thrive! If you aren’t going to out her as a fraud, use it for yourself. Bask in your grandparents happiness at the gathering - you know your accomplishments are the only real ones, but they don’t - their happiness will be genuine, and remembering them proud, happy and having a great time at the gathering will be a wonderful memory to keep close. 

My grandfather rallied long enough to be there for my engagement party and my grandmother had a massive stroke 1 week before my wedding ... their happiness about knowing I was in love and getting married means the world to me ... they both died before things went south and we divorced. While I wish they could have known S, my perfect soulmate (omg - they would have loved him!!!), they knew my ex when we were happy and felt happiness knowing I was happy. The divorce didn’t diminish that ... and WHEN your SiL is outed as a fraud, the happy memory of them being happy won’t diminish either.

Don’t seethe because you know she is a garbage person getting undue attention and praise, just take in all of the happiness and love of the day and remember the people you love as they were when they were celebrating. You worked hard - do NOT let her win by you being upset and distracted that day! Easier said than done, but I promise, it’s doable!

Your SiL’s day will come - yeah, it sucks out loud she is being honored alongside you for something only you accomplished, but tune her out - focus on how happy people are that day. If this is going to be the last time everyone gets together to celebrate, wring every drop of joy from that day and do your best to forget that you know the truth about her. 

THEN have your fun making her squirm after the gathering ... the perfect revenge is that twisting guilty anxiety she is going to feel every time anyone mentions her “accomplishments.”

Congratulations - you worked hard and I wish you every happiness as your bright future unfolds!"
485,[deleted]
486,"They're doing it because they felt entitled to do it. I'm guessing from your wife's response this isn't the first time something like this has happened but it's probably the worst thing.

Do not attempt to intervene, no matter how you feel about your in-laws. Let her handle this."
487,"Are you not fighting because you never disagree or have any issues, because when you disagree and have issues you calmly discuss them, or because when you disagree or have issues you ignore/repress them and never deal with them? The first two are healthy and the third is not.

I've never had a ""blowout"" fight with my husband. There hasn't been much if any yelling, there's *never* been any belittling (your partner belittling you is a reason to leave the relationship, always!) or insults, etc. It's because when we have disagreements/issues we discuss them and come to an agreement on how to handle them, like adults, instead of letting resentment build up and then throwing tantrums. That's normal for a healthy relationship."
488,"&gt; But what the hell is his move or motive here? 

His motive is to try to manipulate you into continuing to pay all his bills. "
489,"If you want to do a confrontation do it 1 at a time. Saw ""friend told me about last night, boyfriend. Anything to say for yourself?"" And do do the same to her. One will cave, and if not you've got proof already so be done with it."
490,"I just cackled with laughter in hte office at ""gotta say I'd go gay for a dick like this"".  What a tool"
491,"The text sounds pretty innocent to me, too. I agree that he's probably actually upset that you did what you wanted instead of what he wanted.   

Unless you want to have some version of this fight forever, I think you're just going to have to lay it out there that getting you to cut out of your previously made plans via emotional blackmail is unacceptable. He may not even realize that's what he's doing, but that's what it is.

You two need to decide if ultimately you're compatible or not. An very independent person and a less independent person can have a relationship that works but it takes some effort to understand each other and work past insecurities, especially for the less independent person. "
492,"Soooo many people come here to post asking if they are 'justified' to feel a certain way.  As if there were some official committee somewhere that made decisions about which emotions were valid and which weren't.  But emotions aren't valid or invalid - they just are.  The question is never ""should I feel this way?"" It's ""what should I do about how I feel?"". It's an important distinction.

So your boyfriend has a secret account he doesn't want you to know about, and he uses it to engage in sexual conversations and digital catcalls of other women.  You feel disgusted, disappointed, and hurt.  Other women might feel angry, destructive, or confrontational.  Still other women might feel unconcerned, intrigued, or excited.  But that doesn't matter, all that matters is how you feel.  

So what are you going to do about how you feel?  Do you think asking him questions about what you found and why he does this would bring you more clarity?  Do you think your dignity has been so wounded that breaking up is the only viable path?  Do you think you're just surprised but if you sleep on it you might not care as much in the morning?  I don't know.  No one here knows.  Only you know, but you've got to be honest with yourself and ask the right questions."
493,"It's your body,  you told him your stance on kids,  it's not your fault he chose to hear 'I don't want kids'  as 'I don't want kids YET'. 

6 months is really early for this to even be coming up anyway.   

Personally I think you should walk away.  Even if you wanted kids,  having them yourself might bloody well kill you! That's just a ridiculous risk to take for something you don't even want! And if you did let him pressure you into kids,  you'd probably end up resenting them and him.  Which is bad for everyone. "
494,"He needs to keep his mouth shut about his winnings. Please see this survival guide for more information about what he needs to do to survive the incoming storm.

https://amp.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vzgl/you_just_won_a_656_million_dollar_lottery_what_do/chba4bf"
495,"OP, you're right. This is not something you can continue to do and boundaries are needed. At this point, it's a consequence of her choice, not an emergency. This is a pattern you all know by now. It's good to say you don't want to be part of it anymore.

It also sounds like it's time for CPS. If the parents aren't providing for the children, that's neglect. So, while your sister might not want to leave, maybe her kids can be placed somewhere where they have stability and all necessities to be safe. If you aren't an option, they will make sure there are vetted strangers. But at this point, anything is better than where they are now, because they won't be kicked out at 2 am at those places with only the clothes on their backs. 

She's an adult, she can decide otherwise and if she wants her kids back, CPS will work with her, but likely work towards her to leave him. If she wants to stay, this situation is at least on the radar of social services. "
496,"Exactly. You don't know how long she'll end up living with you. And being a caretaker is always a strain on a marriage and family, even if the person is kind and loving, let alone abusive. "
497,"The two of you can tell her parents that you will be contacting all the gifters to thank them, explain that your in laws stole the money and you are filing a police report, and need to know much much the gift was for. Then file a police report and press charges. And then cut them out of your lives forever. "
498,"I know parents like this and trust me, they’re only like this to you because of their own insecurities about themselves.  "
499,"NOPE. You are paying your own rent. You have broken up and are working on your divorce (aren't you? AREN'T YOU??) and he wants to move back in because he's a whiny little baby who can't cope with the very legitimate consequences of his actions? His problems are your problems. When he shows up, do not answer the door. Consider getting the locks changed just in case he has a spare key hidden somewhere.

His wellbeing is *not your problem anymore* because *he broke up with you*. Let him enjoy the well-deserved fruits of his actions."
500,"It’s fine that you think it’s her responsibility, but what the poster is saying is that there is no version of the future where you guys stay together that doesn’t involve couples counseling. So the real question is whether you want to stay with her.

As for her individual therapist, perhaps she needs a new one and/or meds for both alcohol abuse and whatever her underlying mental health issues might be."
501,Your bf is abusive and you need to leave him. There is no fixing this. Get your own bank account and start building a plan to leave this guy. Don't stay with someone who doesn't respect you as an adult. 
502,"So I am a wine drinker as well.  Here is the thing about box wines.  They are way to easy to either over pour or to not realize how much you have had.  If you open a bottle, you can visually see how much you have consumed.  Not so with a box. It is really easy to start over imbibing.  It happened to me.  I really didn't realize how much I had been consuming until I returned to bottled wine exclusively.

But there is good news here. First, I figured out that inexpensive bottles of wine are normally cheaper than box wine!  That's a win!  Box wines seem like a deal, but do the math compared to some bottom shelf wine.  And do the taste tests.  There are better wines for cheaper out there if you look around.

But more importantly, your college age friends are telling you that you are drinking too much.  Unless they are extremely unusual, they drink too.  If they are calling you out, I suggest you take a good long look at what you are doing.  Just because you aren't stumbling drunk or hungover doesn't mean you don't have a problem."
503,Is it a sugar daddy/baby situation maybe?
504,Your gf comes off as super controlling and doesn't seem interested in getting to know your family at all. The fact that she was angry at you for going to your grandma's funeral is a big red flag IMO and she doesn't seem to trust you at all. Do you ever feel like she's trying to keep you away from from family and friends?
505,He probably hooked up with a vacuum cleaner. 
506,"This should be a deal breaker not only because he read your diary, but after the fact he used the information against you and tried to make you feel like crap about yourself and your past. My warning light is going off. "
507,"Him wanting a solo vacation is not the problem, he could easily go away for a couple of days by himself. It’s uninviting you from your planned family vacation! That’s so fucked up! You had planned this together as a family, I’m assuming your first family vacation, and then he just kicks you out of it? That’s really shitty to me "
508,"OP, as someone who has experienced devastating data loss from a broken hard drive....put that shit AWAY. Put that shit away. PUT THAT SHIT AWAY. And probably invest in online back up. I know from experience it only takes clumsily knocking it on the floor once to completely be fucked. 

I agree that Fran is in the wrong and she does not get to unilaterally control the living spaces. She should absolutely know better than to throw your things away. With the same effort, she could have gone and put it in your room. 

However, permission to work in the kitchen =/= permission to leave stuff there.

If you’re frequently in a rush to the point you can’t put your valuables/work stuff in your room, that’s a time management issue YOU need to work on. Set a timer 5-10 minutes before you leave and give yourself time to clean up. "
509,Some people just don't like or want to argue and aren't easily angered.
510,"You said she uses dating app to get free meal. Why don't you think she did the same to you? You met online too, right? You've only known her for a short time... Alarm bells are ringing m"
511,Same in Ontario. Happened to me when I gave two weeks notice and they let me go that night. I got two weeks pay any way. 
512,"On the one hand, this is entirely her fault for asking a question she didn't actually want the answer to. On the other hand, I have on million percent made your wife's mistake time and again because I'm so dumb, I underestimate my own insecurity/ability to get jealous all the time.

Sit your wife down and let her know you feel like your answer to her question made her uncomfortable. Reassure her she MORE than satisfies you all ways, but, very specifically, sexually. Then, if I were you, I'd emphasize that it's just a fantasy. You can love imaging yourself as a super spy, but you're not at all interested in applying for work at the CIA. Ask her if any part of the fantasy makes her uncomfortable, then speak to those insecurities sensitively.

Odds are that you should still downplay the ""stranger"" part of the fantasy, or at least help her better understand it. You don't want to be with anyone else, you're not even specifically envisioning other people. It's the fantasy of the first-time, which, if she WANTS, she could 100% play out with you. It's pretty common, maybe the MOST common form of roleplay - she shows up to a hotel bar in a wig where you've already booked a room, and the night goes from there. It's not about being with other people, it's about a temporary, HARMLESS escape from the stress and monotony of what you know is a lovely, happy life that you'd never EVER actually do anything to risk."
513,"In the first half you had me thinking yeah he might have slept with her, but he’s taking initiative to tell you that he noticed her behavior was inappropriate and it’s not fair to you so he’s doing the right thing there. Which would lead me to believe that he hasn’t slept with her. 

Maybe they played video games and she made a move on him and he turned her down?"
514,[deleted]
515,"Well, then he can put his money where his mouth is by immediately reciprocating and giving his friends the opportunity to eat half his fish and drink half his water during the same event. Aka ""buying the next round"". 

He needs to understand that reciprocating isn't just a nice thought you express to the universe that someday 20 years later you will return the gesture. It's an action to return the gesture."
516,"This is exactly it. I like wine, I like boxed wine even (bota box red blend is my shit), but boxed wine under the table when your friends are telling you that you drink too much? Yeah, you’ve got a problem. 

Another test: OP, can you go a day without drinking wine? Can you go a week? Do you feel like you’re unable to go to sleep without a few drinks? "
517,I've had four bad experiences since 6 am. My life is garbage though.
518,"&gt;You don't need to punish her.  You need to walk away.

Well, this. If you ever reach a point where you want to ""punish"" your SO, then the relationship isn't healthy anymore."
519,"Personally, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship who saw mixed-gender friendships as inherently suspicious."
520,Why are you planning a future with someone who lives in a delusional fantasy world?
521,"&gt; When your wife asks you for something, have her rank it on a priority scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not urgent and 10 being maximum urgent. Like, driving her to the hospital in labor is 10. 1 would be pick up crackers from the grocery store. Please push back if you think she's abusing the scale, ranking everything a 10.

really great suggestion 

thanks for offering constructive help and not just yelling at someone "
522,"&gt; There are better relationships out there. BUT you build them, you don't ""go find"" them.

This is some great advice."
523,"Hoooollllly shit, girl. That’s way beyond a red flag. "
524,"You and your siblings are enabling your brother's irresponsibility.

He knows that he doesn't need to be responsible, because he always gets bailed out. So, what incentive does he have to learn to be an adult. None.

You are just going to have to let him face the consequences of his decisions. In time, life will force him to be responsible, but this will never happen if you keep bailing him out.

So, just tell him, ""no.""

You should also reach out to your sibs and advise the to do the same."
525,"Do not ask him. It’s extremely inappropriate. He may have to report these incidences to cover his ass because it’s probably not allowed to date students . Don’t mess up his career or your education , stayyyyy away "
526,"Also, another note about wine. 

Sometimes I only have two or three glasses of wine too.

I have my wine glass, yes? And I fill it up 80 percent of the way. This is not ""one glass"" of wine, let's all be real. It's two or maybe even three servings of wine. And then two or three of those over the course of the evening... now it's six to nine glasses of wine. Which is a lot of fucking wine.

I'm a drunk. I'm also a lot older than OP so I'm admitting all this in the hopes maybe something will resonate with her."
527,"Maybe I’m just cynical, but to suddenly not be “afraid” of needles and want to get a tat with a guy she just met sounds fishy to me. 

I feel like I need to hear the reason you weren’t invited to come up with a better answer."
528,"&gt; Your parents can't ""not let"" him stay at his own place

this is mind boggling to me!

He pays to live there!  Her parents can't kick him out of his own freaking apartment!  I can't believe OP is even entertaining this!"
529,"\&gt;  On the nights I work the next morning I want to go to sleep by 930 so I can get fully rested. He tries to keep me awake because he's not ready for bed yet and will end up keeping me up until 10-1030. 

That would be more upsetting to me, but I agree he was selfish about the airport.

How does he keep you awake?  Are you firm that you want to sleep and he just keeps pestering you?"
530,"I didn't say she is to blame. She's not. All I'm saying is that his current attitude isn't shocking, since he'd made his stance clear from the get go. And unfortunately, you can't make someone parent a child. But she better make sure he pays. "
531,I'm pissed as hell for you. Not only is he cheating but she slept in your bed?  That's is insanely disrespectful to me. Get a divorce lawyer and take him (and her) down. It would take every ounce of me to not confront  him in anger if I were you but you are probably best to not say  a word of what you found out to him and to get legal advice first to take care of yourself and your children.  Best of luck to you. 
532,"&gt; I'm supposed to be the best man, to shower them with love and compliments and talk about how great of a couple they are and how excited that I am they are getting married but I can't do that because it would all be lies.

Okay, I know you’re young and this sounds tricky, but you can make a best man speech that is both positive AND truthful. And I really think you should try. 

Talk about how much you love your brother, how you were best friends growing up. Throw in a couple of cute anecdotes about a time you got into trouble, or did something dumb, or whatever you’ve got that hits that sweet spot between endearing and mildly embarrassing. Focus on your affection for your brother, and how honored you feel to be chosen as his best man. You can conclude with a couple sentences about how happy his fiancée makes him (true, as far as you know) and how clear it is that he’s devoted to her (definitely true, even if you don’t think it’s a good thing). Express your best wishes for their marriage and end with a “welcome to the family, Donna.” 

Don’t do it for her. Do it to keep the door open for your brother. Show him that he’s still welcome in your life, that his choices will be respected by you, and that he can depend on you even when it’s hard or uncomfortable. He definitely knows that there’s tension between his fiancée and his family, and being young, he may interpret that tension as a threat to *his* bond with you. Show him that fear is unfounded. You don’t have to click with his fiancée to honestly wish him happiness in his marriage. Because presumably, you do. "
533,You should stop being friends with this person because she sounds terrible. And warn the poor dude that she's unstable and hateful.
534,"Honestly I would work to change this rather than bailing. ""Leave or endure"" aren't your only options. I would suggest an individual counselor for you, and then a couples counselor for the two of you."
535,"I’m an education volunteer in sub-Saharan Africa with the Peace Corps. 

It sounds to me like your girlfriend has some seriously unreasonable expectations for what volunteering would be. 

Often times it’s not fun and frankly the idea of coming to volunteer and helping “the less fortunate” is kind of offensive. People here don’t view them selves as less fortunate, they have rich engaging lives full of meaning. They simply don’t have some of the amenities that Americans take for granted. 

Many people where I live don’t even like foreign aid. They want Africans to stop depending on foreign aid or volunteering so that Africa can develop itself. 

Have her sit down and read some Peace Corps blogs etc. It might give her some more reasonable expectations. Read ‘Dead Aid,’ watch Posh Corps and just do research. 

Finally the idea of “Africa.” Its a huge place with so much diversity. If she can’t even say on a map “this is where I think I can be most useful.” Then she isn’t ready to come here. "
536,"all of this kind of made my skin crawl. I wouldn't be able to be with someone so self absorbed and concerned with superfecial things. I'm not saying its neccesarily WRONG I'm sure there are girls out there equally self concerned who would be into it, but I doubt he'll change much and if its a turn off its a turn off. I mean, i think its worth mentioning it to him ""Don't you think 16 selfies is excessive? Could you consider complimenting ME instead of YOURSELF when we're having sex?""  to gauge his reaction. If he becomes super defensive, then I don't know how you'd move forward."
537,"Former CPS worker here (not in the US though, so YMMV). Don’t worry about your kitchen being fully stocked, just make sure there’s enough. It’s unlikely to be an issue unless your daughter is showing symptoms of starvation or malnourishment, which she likely isn’t. 

Even tidiness isn’t the main thing. You’d be surprised the kind of houses we go to. Your house doesn’t have to sparkle, just liveable. 

What’s more important than that stuff, is safety. Baby proof your apartment. Definitely make sure that any cleaning supplies/other dangerous stuff is very safely put away and locked out of reach (this was always specifically mentioned on our checklist guidelines). Make sure your daughter has a safe and appropriate place to sleep. Enough clothing and diapers. Age appropriate toys.

CPS won’t be an issue as long as you’re doing your best, and it sounds like you are. We aren’t horrible people. We’re regular humans, with a lot more important stuff to do than get involved in people’s messy custody battles, especially one like this. You’re young, which *is* a risk factor, but “young, single, grieving dad” isn’t a child protection issue in itself, unless your mental health deteriorates to a point where you literally can’t care for your daughter. Which reminds me, make sure to see a grief counsellor. You should do it for your own sake, but you should also do it because it shows any social workers or lawyers or judges that you’re being proactive in the situation you’ve found yourself in.

So sorry for your loss, I can’t even imagine what you’re going through and how upside down your life must feel right now. It sounds like you’re doing the very best you can at raising your daughter despite how miserable you must feel, and that takes a lot of strength. Your daughter is very lucky to have you, and any social worker/judge worth their seat would know better than to separate the two of you. Keep doing what you’re doing, and you’ll get through it. "
538,"You have a text where hes extorting you. Say youre worried about him. He asked for some money and you told him you didnt have anything to give so hes threatening you over some bogus shit, and youre worried what hes into to need the money so badly."
539,Yeah. I think OP has a bigger fiance problem than they do an in-laws problem. 
540,"Hire someone to come clean once or twice a week, she needs her rest &amp; you need your sanity. It’s probably your best option."
541,"Fuck her, take one of the cameras while she is gone. If she texts you to put it back, ask how she new it was moved whole she was out of the dorm. Also take a bunch of photos of the cameras so she can't rove them and deny it. 

Just confirm her, tell her it's not on. Call out her therapy light BS, and don't feel bad about maybe offending her, she offended you when she put fucking cameras around the place.

Also call the cops once you know they are cameras.

And push for a closer meeting with the housing managers. Just keep harrassing them saying you are being filmed, it's fucked that they would wait 6 weeks. They have to fucking listen and not give you some bullshit 6 week answer."
542,"I wonder if the fact that the only 2 ex's of yours that she's met have been POC that she wonders if you find her attractive?  

She's going about it the wrong way, but it sounds like she might be looking for reassurance that she is your ""type"" or that you think she's pretty."
543,"Yeah, you should bring it up, even if it embarrasses him. A person in my friend group is like this, and believe me, other people notice even if they're polite in the moment. Sounds as if your bf already thinks it's OK behavior, though, given his response to the water incident. "
544,"Yeah, not to mention that this is way beyond just wanting to change rooms due to personal preference. There's no way they can/should/will charge you $500 to change from \*this\* roommate."
545,"Counseling is not a ""punishment"" that ""only the guilty one should have to do."" 

Counseling is an important tool for bettering relationships, solving communication problems, and expressing issues that aren't being deeply explored enough. If you want to try to keep this relationship, I highly recommend that you guys look into couples counseling.

If you feel like it hasn't been working well for her so far, it may be that she hasn't been fully honest with her therapist about what's going on. She might be too ashamed to admit it. However, with both of you there in the room, the full story will have to be on display. 

You guys will also be able to discuss the ramifications of her actions upon your family, social circle, and workplace."
546,This is extremely sound advice. I hope OP takes it.
547,"Nooo....oneeee...

Fucks like Gaston

Is a schmuck like Gaston

Has his lips firmly 'round his own nuts like Gaston"
548,"Absolutely it is. It's not a 1:1 comparison, but it's about as close as you're going to get without borrowing someone's kid.

Kids need more from people than puppies do. Sure, puppies need to go out, but kids need diaper changes. You can't just leave a kid in a crate and go out for an afternoon. If all of the puppy responsibility is falling on you, and he refuses to change that, you'll experience the same thing when a baby comes along.

&amp;#x200B;"
549,I agree. Either one of them is dragging their feet and not sure if they want to go through with the wedding so they're delaying planning or they have financial problems and can't afford a wedding right now but don't want to admit that. I'd lean towards the first one being the answer.
550,"Yes, this anger and becoming out of control part of you, OP, needs some attention. That part of you needs to be heard and find some healing in therapy. It's normal that this is all coming up with your sister being in contact, but you need safe space to deal with your own emotions instead of blowing up."
551,"&gt;He has learned that he can make you happy with food and he likes to make you happy.

This is *exactly* it, I guarantee you.

I'm the exact same way, so I'm speaking from experience.  I would be a lot of money that the following is true:

1) OP gets upset and grumpy when she wants food but knows she can't have it.

2) The bad mood carries over into other things.

3) OP's partner knows that a snack will instantly fix things.

4) OP's partner likes to make OP happy."
552,"Haha unfortunately the Star Wars theme might be a little bit tooooo believable for me and my boyfriend! (I am kidding, but we're also big Star Wars fans lol) 

But you're right, perhaps if I make light of the situation she'll see how silly comparing weddings is. I just dont understand when it became a competition anyway - its so sad these days.

I'd marry my SO right now in a registry office if it meant he wanted to be with me for the rest of our lives. "
553,"You did nothing wrong and she's being remarkably entitled. She wants to stay at your place because it's convenient for her, on your dime doing none of the work and sharing none of the expense and she's pissed that you aren't cool with that. After all, isn't having the pleasure of her company payment enough!? /s

Don't budge. Set the precedent that you're not going to be taken advantage of. ""I'm sorry you're upset, but I'm not comfortable paying for 100% of the expenses while you live hear nearly full time without contributing. I'd like to have you hear, but only if you're willing to pay like you would anywhere else. Otherwise you need to find a different arrangement."" Be sure to suggest to her all the other places she could live and eat 100% free and giving back in no way whatsoever near her work. I'm sure there are *tons* of other options like that, right?"
554,"Block him.

&amp;#x200B;

If he tries to contact you through other means, tell him to leave you alone or you will get the police involved. "
555,"This is maybe the most cautiously optimistic outcomes possible. He's not pushy or demanding. 

Please explore all of your concerns, you are handling this masterfully!"
556,"You married a ""keep the peace"" type of person. You did not marry a 
""fight tooth and nail for what is right"" type of person. You need to recognize that's a choice you made. You can't get mad at your wife for not being a fighter and defender when you married her knowing who she was. That would be like being pissed that she doesn't suddenly write with her other hand.  

Of course, we can all stomp up and down and say the usual - ""cut them off"" ""get counselling.. "" whatever, and so on. But, you knowingly married into a toxic family and to a spouse who wouldn't defend you. You are going to have to draw and enforce your own boundaries, nobody else will do that for you. What that will mean for your marriage, we don't know. Because, you'll probably end up resenting your wife for not being a fighter.. but.. you did know in advance so work on balancing your feelings."
557,"Hi! 

I'm the legal guardian of my younger siblings as well, and they were the same way.

They took all of their bad moods and issues out on me because they upset and hurt that they didn't have ""real"" parents and moody teenagers have a hard time processing that. 

We are all older now, they're out of high school and we're super close! 

I think it'll get better for you too, just make sure she knows that she can always count on you.  "
558,"You need to tell this dude you cannot host him as an overnight guest anymore. It doesn't sound like he is very inclined to leave after a ""short visit"" and whose wellbeing is more important to you, your husband or your BIL?

Encourage him to get therapy, which you probably should as well because it sounds like you are clinging to BIL as a stand in for your sister, at the expense of boundaries your husband wants. "
559,"The girlfriend sounds far too immature to be in an adult relationship, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t raise an eyebrow at that wording, too. "
560,You mean ex fiancé right. He’s fucking cheating on you. 
561,Maybe think twice about marrying him.
562,5 years left until you're 30 is the strangest way I've heard someone say they are 25. Made me laugh a bit. 
563,"&gt;my girlfriends mom commented on how if I cant even do the baby's hair, what else must I be slacking on?

This is just absurd. I mean the worst. Your child is a BABY. I would question this woman's values around your daughter. You don't need to raise her to feel like she is ""less"" if her hair isn't done a certain way. And your daughter should not be around someone who is telling her her father isn't doing a great job. 

I am a mother of kids your age and my heart just breaks for you. I can't imagine your loss and I can't imagine your inlaw's loss. They should be helping you in anyway they can and sharing your joy in your daughter. Instead they have made it impossible for you to trust them and you will question their influence on your child for a long time. 

Keep leaning on your mom. Tell her you don't want her to bring up your grief anymore; you are working through it your own way. She is worried about you and as a mother of sons, we just want to make everything allright and hate it when we can't. Good luck! I'm sure you are going to be a great dad. "
564,Yeah last night was the last time 
565,"My mother is a heavy alcoholic and she sounded almost exactly like you when confronted about it.

OP, you gotta problem.

PS: I'm an alcoholic too. None of us are as smart/sneaky as we think we are. Shit's way more obvious than you think. People know. 

You're the only one refusing to accept the reality of your situation. "
566,"1, your husband is wrong about this


2, you have the right to be annoyed but you are annoyed at the wrong person. FW did nothing wrong. BFF was the one being rude to you.


 think about it in this way. If BFF told you the person txting her all night was someone you didn't know. Were you going to blame the stranger or your BFF for being rude? The rude behavior is not the person txting BBF.  It's the BFF.


 BFF should've put her phone away. Switched it off to give you her full attention and then respond to FWs txts after you left. FW could've sent her 1 txt, 5 txts or 20 txts. It's irrelevant. What is relevant is your BFF would not put her phone away. You annoyed at the wrong person."
567,This. Don't fucking lie to them. You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
568,He just told you he can't guarantee he wouldn't cheat on you.  Believe him.
569,"You invite him, that's what matters. He can *think* what he likes, and he doesn't have to *like* that you go, but bluntly he's got to suck it up and cope. 

&gt; He just ends them by saying that I should know better and that he has expressed his point of view. And if I don’t know better then we have a problem in our relationship. 

He's a patronising ass, but he's right, you do have a problem. Him. You're not ""wrong"" to want to go out with your friends. He's clearly got his own opinions about ""bar culture"" for want of a better term, and you've got yours. He can't actually back up his with any facts, he's just trying to browbeat you into acting in ways he's comfortable. **He** ""should know"" that you can go out with friends as often as you like, and it's not his place to stop you. If he's so worried about what ""looks bad to other people"" he should think about how it looks when he tries to control his partner. It's not your job to broadcast your relationship status, and it's not his job to keep you out of situations he deems dangerous. Honestly it just seems like you're incompatible. You can't control being grabbed by a large guy on the street! If he's so worried about your safety or things looking appropriate, he should come with you. Arguably by his standards he's letting you down by not accompanying you...

570,AND they work at the same place.

E: editing because of OP’s new edit: I have whiplash. The relationship looks unhealthy on both sides. "
573,The likely answer is OP's boyfriend was giving aggressive blow jobs
574,"She’s trickle-truthing you. I bet they did more than kiss one time. There’s definitely an emotional affair going on as well. 

It’s up to you to to decide it you want to try to salvage your marriage. From what you’ve said in your post, it doesn’t sound like infidelity is a set in stone dealbreaker for you, but still, couple’s counselling would be a good idea to help the two of you work through this situation. "
575,"I agree with this 100%. While he definitely didn’t handle it right, caretaker burnout is a real thing. I’d suggest doing therapy if you can afford it or finding some support groups (online or in person) that you can unload some of this on.

It’s one thing to share your hard times with a partner, it’s another thing to expect them to split the burden of those hard times with you. "
576,"&gt;You'll just be enabling your gf's bad behavior.

Indeed! If you block G, you show your GF that her attempts at manipulation are successful. When she understands the method works, she will use it again. This will enable more of the same in the future, and she will strip you of all your friends.

If he'd been shitty to you right away, would you have stayed? Probably not. Once he reeled you in with sweetness, he felt comfortable letting the real him show. The fact that he is unwilling to do even a very little thing like put headphones in so as not to ruin your sleep is really horrible, and him calling you names and acting offended is rude and manipulative."
579,Tell him to go to the bathroom and pretend to poop like a normal husband does!!!
580,"&gt;but he doesn’t want to lose me

He's got a funny way of showing it! It's not an insult to *consider* that someone might have an STD, and whatever the question, he flipped out, ordered you to leave, threatened you with a beating, was shaking with rage, called you names, then he wouldn't let you leave. All of that is **insane**. That would be an insane response to virtually anything you did. Anyone capable of acting like that is capable of so much more, and worse. Because that doesn't come from nowhere, that level of aggression is just under the surface waiting for the next trigger."
581,"I'm currently in a PhD program. Just passed my comp exams (woohoo). You clearly know what you're talking about. He does not. There is a reason he got reject apply for programs last year. What does he think those reasons are?

Sounds to me like he has already decided that either you don't know what you're talking about (which is not true) or he is is just not going to listen. Maybe he needs to hear it from someone else.

Grad school is a stress on a relationship, so I would be worried you may not make it out the otherside together. 

PhD programs are focused on research. Not coursework. Imo, the coursework is a nuisance that takes your time away from the lab. The first 4 years IS dedicated to courses. And then you get to start your dissertation. 6 years minimum without a Masters. No one in my program in the has finished in under 7 years (without a masters).

Also, a PhD is a waste of money and time of you don't have a specific plan to use it."

OP, it's up to you, but I wouldn't even bother telling your parents. I'd just disappear, but that's me. 

As for your parents' financial support - time to cut the cord. If you want to live freely the price may be a reduction in your monthly income, but that'd happen anyway with your brother's scheme. "

I would speak first to the instructor, but if that doesn't get results, find out who is the Title IX contact person. "
596,"She's putting the lives of your children in danger on a regular basis. That alone is enough to kick her out. 

When I was her age I was homeless and a family friend took me in. I worked, bought groceries, cooked, cleaned, drove the kids, helped with homework... She has no idea how to act. If these are the lies you've caught her in, imagine how much else there is you don't know about. It sounds like she comes from an abusive background. I do too, and while it's sad, it's not an excuse to take advantage of a kindhearted family while lying, going behind your backs, it's not a reason to sacrifice the safety of your own children, who are SO much more vulnerable than she is."
597,The technical term for this is called 'being a hater'. The documentary series Chappelle's Show has some  great info if you want to study up on this condition. 
598,"All her friends hate you and you're a such nice guy!  I don't buy that.

   I used to have a manipulative friend and she could demonize her boyfiend all she wanted, but I know what kind of person she is.  

 If all her friends hate you maybe they have a point.  They can make some judgement about you and her ability to tell the truth.  You don't come across as a nice guy, even in your post, and you seem to be leaving out a lot of details on purpose.

And now it sounds like you're trying to isolate her from her friends which is classic abusive behavior."
599,Not necessarily another guy. It could also be drugs. She's staying out until she sobers up or to meet a dealer. But something shady is definitely going on. 
600,There is no such thing as a forever couch. That's not a thing. Your girlfriend seems incredibly selfish and self centered. Not a good sign.

Someone as oblivious as your boyfriend will never make it. Even if he gets in, he won't complete his PhD. I think it is time for a soft ultimatum. After this cycle of applications, he needs to look at other more reasonable options. You are right that you can't put your life on hold for him forever. Do you want kids? At best he will be 32 when he completes his PhD, which means you have kids later in life (not necessarily a bad thing) or you have kids while he is still under immense pressure."
604,People who love you don’t constantly insult you and tear you down. Why are you putting up with this jackass?

In theory, yes, that is a good idea.  In practice, not so much.  Given the state your nephew was in, involving the police was likely to do more harm than good and could have resulted in your nephew being arrested, hospitalized, or dead.  You did the right thing by going yourself.

613,Your mom must be cool.
614,piggybacking on this comment to say the reason he tells you (OP) youre stupid and annoying all the time is so that you think nobody else would „put up“ with you. hes trying to erode your self esteem so that you think you have no choice than to stay in this relationship because you need him. *this is not true! you deserve better than this. much better.* you know this and youre doing the right thing in breaking up with him. this guy is a typical abuser and imo would escalate into more and more abusive behavior if you keep him around.
615,"I've worked in restaurants with bars, and late night cafes, and it is extremely rare to have to stay more than an hour past close. If I ever did have to, I would bitch about it all the next day.

She already established the normal close up time of about an hour past 11:30. There's absolutely no way that it randomly started to take 4-5 hrs to close up a restaurant on a regular basis."
616,"Um - I want to know if my boyfriend is going out after work. Am I making dinner? Will he take the dog out or go right after work? Did he get into a car accident? Is he dead? Did his phone die? Its not that hard to send a text saying ""Hey, dont worry, Im just out with friends, I'll be home before 11"". 

If hes that combative about it, stop telling him what youre doing. Don't call, don't text, don't let him know where you are. See how far that goes and relay that it probably is disrespectful for partners NOT to communicate what they are doing. "
617,"From what I know, it's not the first time he's done this.

It was my brother-in-law's 18th birthday 2 months ago and he had to hide the money he had been given from the members of the temple they go to as it was a substantial amount.

I just don't understand why someone's father could do this to them."
618,"It doesn't sound to me, like everyone else is saying, that she wants an abusive person. It sounds to me like she wants a dom, as in the BDSM sense, but she's not mature enough to do the necessary groundwork, and - worse - she doesn't give a crap what you want.

BDSM relationships take trust and communication. You can't just magically will your partner into being what you want. She hasn't tried to lay any of the groundwork for a BDSM relationship, like a frank discussion on desires, and practical ways to meet them. She actually refuses to talk about it.

I'd walk away, honestly. She doesn't sound mature enough for an adult relationship. She's putting all this pressure on you, never even stopping to consider if it's what *you* want, but can't adult up and talk about it? No thanks."

He's her drug.

She met up with him.

She got her fix.

She had a ""clear"" head after and decided that you're the best option and only wants you.

Sooner or later though, she's gonna need another fix.

Is that what you want to live with?"
622,"Thank you, this isn't something I ever thought I would have to go through. I would deal with every argument or disagreement a million times if it meant having her back. I thought we'd be getting old together, and now I'll never see her again and it breaks my heart. Sometimes it feels like I can't cope, and I'm trying so hard to hold it together. 

I'm sorry for your loss as well, and I'm sorry things ended up that way. I hole things are going well for you now. I'll definitely start looking around for a lawyer to talk to, hopefully their threats aren't legally serious. 

I do keep my apartment clean aside from the obvious baby toys and all that. I guess I'll have to go grocery shopping soon, just in case. Thank you for the advice."
623,"This was going to be my suggestion too. A friend of mine has a keypad one and it's, frankly, kind of brilliant since you don't have to worry about people (namely kids) forgetting their keys.

I know how hard it is, I have wasted a lot of time on relationships that were draining me, but this guy is truly a waste. It sounds like you are a really cool and passionate person. "
625,"You almost certainly know this already, but just in case: If you've ever smoked weed (or done any other drugs), make sure there is absolutely no trace of it anywhere in your apartment, and don't so much as sit in a room where other people are smoking for the foreseeable future. THC stays in your system for a long time and if they claim you're using drugs you could end having to take a test. I'm probably overly paranoid, but I would avoid poppy seed bagels just in case. 

Also, make sure your daughter is seeing her paediatrician regularly-- if they start alleging child abuse, you'll have a written record that your kid has been healthy and happy with no cause for concern. "
626,"You've got a lot of grandeur involved around two weeks of traveling and it's impacting your critical thinking abilities. If you're at a point were you can even entertain the idea of fucking other people then this relationship isn't right for you.

This is your issue.

You're actually so good at running the household that he doesn't see the effort it takes. He just sees a nice clean and tidy home with happy kids and happy wife. He is unaware of the EFFORT it takes for this to magically happen.

This is going to be a hard conversation, but you are going to have to be blunt with him, and very direct, and it sounds like you are not?"
633,"I've got no advice, I just wanted to chip in and say that this would run me up the wrong way too. "
634,"Yep, I had a partner who was coming home at those times, long after the bar should've closed, and it turned out to be that he was watching the sunrise with another woman (and whatever the hell else went along with it). I hope this isn't OP's situation, but pretty sure it is, sadly."
635,"On the other hand, if she can’t afford a wedding planner... I think that unless there is a dramatic change in the way she deals with her lack of confidence, this relationship is doomed. Op is going to waste energy and lose patience until she cannot see her at all anymore. "
636,This. That would make a world of difference for me. 
637,"My sister did the same thing (she was around twenty-one; he was in his late sixties). After two and a half years they've broken up. I was very worried about their relationship, especially because the man was her manager at her job (she was an intern...), and here are some things I did at the time; that might help you?

If she asked me if I liked him, I'd say that the age difference made me nervous but that she seemed happy with them. (I didn't want to lie, but I also didn't want her to feel defensive towards me). I asked to meet him, which made her happy, so we had dinner with the dude. This way I got to know him a little better (and judge what kind of person he is), all while earning brownie points from my sister.

It's really, really important that you don't put her on the defensive. I watched this play out with my parents-- my dad had a shitfit, and their relationship went from being great to almost nonexistent and hateful. It's only very recently that it's improved to where it was, but it wasn't easy. The problem is that, if she *was* in an abusive relationship or if she needed to get out, I don't think she would have been able to swallow her pride to ask my parents. Also, she would push back, and want to prove herself to them. You don't want to put her into that stage-- if something goes wrong and she needs to leave, then you need to be there for her. 

There were some dark times in that relationship, and she was able to vent to me because she felt safe that I wasn't going to judge her. And while she vented, I focused on her reactions and didn't say anything bad about him (even though I really fucking wanted to!). Instead, I would try to focus on how she felt, on what she wanted out of the relationship, ect, ect. Things that she might mull over later, without it being too pointed. 

Think about what is important: your relationship with your daughter, or getting angry at her over this and potentially losing her, losing her trust, and letting her lose a potential safety net if the guy turns out to be an abusive POS.

It's okay to be mad at her. I think taking a period to calm down is good. Try to figure out what is most important in the scheme of things, and what kind of toll it'd take on you with the different approaches you can come at this.

I wish you good luck."

639,"He sounds difficult. I'd stop using his cards. You don't benefit from doing this, and it's a pain in the ass for you. If he asks why you won't help him get rewards, you can tell him you just can't keep up mentally with the speed of the repayment requirement, and you'd rather earn the rewards on your own damn cards. "
640,Every time I tell him his behavior is mentally abusive he laughs it off like its something he would never do. He cannot comprehend how he is acting.
641,In my experience this is fairly common with depressed people... they believe everyone is always judging them and talking about them. At some point they also really can't cope with the fake smiling that attending such an event would entile for them.
642,"Sounds like your boyfriend can't kiss.. 


Also, you *know* he cheated in his past relationships, Why would you think he'd change? 


As in, has he even said he wants to change or has changed? Or are you just making assumptions. "
643,Make a few videos to show the RA what you are dealing with. Show what time it is and make sure the music is able to be heard. If you need to have your other roommates do the same. Notify the RA that it is regular occurrences and that you have tried to reason with him. If you can try and get the RA to witness what is going on first hand. That’s pretty much the best you can do. In a dorm situation the RA is your only move really. But you and your other roommates need to do it together. 
644,"Then you should've said ""I was planning on cleaning it tomorrow"", not what you said."
645,"The next time he does it, say no and that if he tries again, you’re going to walk away. If he does it again, walk away. It doesn’t need to be in anger, it’s just a simple consequence. Talking it out, teaching, pleading all doesn’t seem to be working, so something new needs to happen.

You need to show that your boundaries are serious no matter how small they seem and that you do follow through on consequences. But after holding your end of the bargain, you’ll find out if he doesn’t respect your boundaries and that’s a much bigger issue. Why he isn’t following through on this is important. And if he continues, you’ll need to figure out what the next consequences will be and follow through on that too."

Parents should never put a child in the middle of their disputes, no matter how old the child is.

This is going to bite you in the ass if you stay on the middle."
648,"So your parents already have a flight booked, refuse to stay at your apartment unless you kick your BF out, and refuse to pay for their own hotel room instead?  What exactly is their plan then?  To manipulate you into giving in to their demands?  I'm assuming your BF pays rent at your apartment so expecting him to leave his own home is ridiculous.  It's also ridiculous to expect you to shell out hundreds of dollars for a hotel room that you will not be using.  Your parents are being manipulative and expecting you to bend to their will.  If you don't stand by your BF on this one, it sets a bad precedent for your relationship and shows him that you prioritize your parents' religious views over his ability to stay in his own home.  If you tell him he has to leave for that week, what's his desire to come back after that?  "
649,"Yeah, even though this sub tends to overreact to a lot of posts, this one is pretty terrible.  This family will be left with possibly irreparable damage if they agree to take this awful woman in.

I remember I starting going to an MMA gym for the first time right after my divorce and ran into a guy who had my exact situation - except he was 3 years out of his, as I am 3 years out of mine now. 

His words were: 'You'll be mad for a long time, and then one day you won't care anymore'. 

He was right. 

What changed my life was I took the angry phase, and used it to motivate myself to learn to diet optimally and get into great physical shape. I thrived on the supportive community of my gym, and it made me not feel alone each night, for years. 

After that I picked up guitar, and used the discipline I learned from the gym to push myself to get better at that hobby. 

Years later, building myself up after such a brutal fall before, I find I attract women who treat me with more respect than my ex wife did. 

It's all part of your path dude, you've been gifted an opportunity for self growth here as much as you have been dealt a painful blow. What you do with this opportunity will be critical! "

My boyfriend is routinely worked 80+ hours a week. It’s not just the long hours, the work he does is exhausting mentally, emotionally and physically.

He works at the hospital, comes home, writes up notes/does more work, relaxes for 1-2 hours (sometimes), sleeps, rinse repeat.

You’ve gotta cut her some slack because she’s not being lazy, she’s just completely exhausted. It’s going to be a difficult time for you two if you’re expecting her to be able to function even remotely on the same level as she was before. "

661,"From the start it sounds like he was open about not wanting the keep the baby, so why are you surprised he is unhappy? He obviously doesn't want to be a dad.

You guys will probably have to go your separate ways. Kids aren't something you can compromise on, ultimately. He clearly doesn't want to be a parent, and you do. It will be better for the baby AND you to be in an environment where you're not resented and treated with hostility. "

You hear what she tells you her therapist says.

Break it off, tell her parents and friends so she has support, cut contact, tell your own family and friends what's going on so they can look out for you too.

I don't know what happened to her, but she needs counselling and therapy and in a few years when she's done some growing as a person she'll turn out okay.

But this isn't up to you to ""fix"", it's not your job to help her. It doesn't make you a bad person to let go of her.

You're in an emotionally abusive relationship. It's unhealthy and no doubt it'll affect you for the next few years as you start dating again.

Look after yourself, take care.

And when she calls to tell you she's going to kill herself or whatever in a few days or weeks, hang up and call the police immediately.

Obviously it would be ideal for her personal development if she could get to the point of saying no, but if you can talk about it with a therapist and get your wife to a point where she is comfortable with you guys saying no together, that might be a good solution.

You’re the only one supporting the two of you right now. He has no right to try and make you skip work. 
He has no right to wake you up at two a.m. to buy him cigarettes, he has no job. He can do it. 
He pouted because he wanted a sit down breakfast...that would likely cost double than fast food, and take twice the time. You had work. 
He called you 30 TIMES?!? Begging you to stay home because he’s “lonely”? YOUR JOB IS THE ONLY INCOME RIGHT NOW, he needs to grow up. 

He is 27 years old, he needs to act like it. You aren’t his mom, caretaker, or possession. He needs to stop treating you like you are. 

Also, you didn’t “put work first”. You put both of y’alls financial well being first. So that way he can have a roof over his head and cigarettes at 2a.m. "

I just gave up on trying to convince these people. A few of them were already against my modeling to begin with. This breakup just gives them more grounds to be against it.

686,"I agree with the above. My ex did very similar things to me, when I said I wanted to leave he'd just grab my arm and pull me back. He'd also say he'd kill himself etc constantly saying we'd work things out. The next day he'd talk to me normally like nothing ever happened, when I raised things he'd be super angry and I got scared and just dropped it.

&amp;#x200B;

long story short we broke up over text, it wasn't intentional, he actually broke up with me right before he left on a plane to visit his mom. When he arrived he just texted me like everything was normal, I told him no not this time. He even offered me a last minute plane ticket to come join him. It's much easier to stand your ground through text. I told him to message me when he's back and organise a time to pick up his stuff, I left his stuff outside my house for him to get so I never even saw him ."
687,"I had an heirloom ring and when we got divorced, I gave it back. Why would I want to keep it? I don't see anything wrong with it, after all, if you never divorce, it will be yours forever. "
688,"Yeaaah I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but he's actually just cheating on you. That text message? The shaving he only ever did when you were first dating? He's admitted to cheating on past girlfriends?

This isn't just a possibility. He's actually just cheating on you in every way, and his excuses are as paper-thin as can be. You should get out of this relationship, because he doesn't seem sorry in the slightest."
689,"Duuuuude, why is someone who is not the parent of your child controlling how you spend your money on said child? Why did you acquiesce to such a thing? How many things have you deprived your kids of cause she says so? Give your damn head a shake. "
690,"""Yeah my wife is pretty amazing, but I prefer keeping my private life separate from my work life. Privacy and all that.""

If you prefer a more direct route, ""you seem awfully interested in my wife."" Normal people would pick up on that and stop asking. If she keeps prying after that then you should be weirded out and feel no guilt in telling her outright you aren't interested in having those discussions with her. Keep chitchat to a minimal."
691,"She's selfish.

 Every single thing you have written about her points to someone who loves themselves more than they would/could ever love anyone else and only has their own wants (notice I didn't say needs) at heart. 

Your girlfriend sounds like a horrible person. Does she have any redeeming qualities?
"
692,[deleted]
693,"So you got sexually assaulted and your girlfriend is mad at you? 
Tell her she either gets over it or it’s over. "
694,"From your original post:

&gt; Guess I just don't know how to stop loving him. 

You don't have to stop loving him. You just had to kick him out. Sometimes, even when you love someone, divorce is the right option. 

&gt; But because he has no memory of it and I've seen him in this weird ""out of it"" state before, I know it wasn't ""him"" per se. 

Do you know what happens to people who drive while black out drunk and hit someone? They are charged and might serve jail time. It doesn't matter that it wasn't him. It matters that he went after your daughter. It matters that he knows his meds give him psychotic episodes and he still takes them around other people. I know he needs the pain meds, but he also needs to make sure he doesn't hurt other people. Remember that if you are with someone if the future who has any condition that might put people around them at risk.
"
695,Honestly they sound super childish. If your friends can't be happy for you for being happy especially after so long you really have no need to be friend with them. 
696,"Ok, they have said something that should have you on high alert. You 100% need to see a family law lawyer. A good one. Get recommendations from people who have been in divorces. Some states have grandparents rights, some don't. Only a lawyers specializing in family law will know if their threat is viable. If you don't have money right now, take out a loan or see if your parents can help. Going into temporary debt is worth it to maintain custody.

Either way, you should treat it as a very legitimate threat. call her doctor and ask them to verify anyone calling for information about your daughter to give them a password. Make sure that your apartment is sterling--they are very likely to call in fake CPS reports. In fact, you may want to call up CPS and be proactive, letting them know that the grandparents may call with a fake report. "
697,"I personally like to stare at the person without speaking until it becomes palpably uncomfortable, and then say ""oh, were you finished? I couldn't tell..."" Source: My husband's family used to ask me frequently how I liked wearing the pants in our relationship, or whether we were excited that gay marriage was legal so we could ""make it official."" (Because I'm tall and outspoken so I might as well be a man, geddit?) First I was hurt, then I was pissed, then I was cold as ice with the above reply. They don't do it anymore. "
698,"YES. What the hell company does he run? That's so inappropriate! If I saw a company liking that shit I wouldn't use them, it seems creepy as hell. "
699,Exactly. It’s best to have the poorest house on the block. 
700,"Oh my god, he’s 50? I completely missed that in the title and read this assuming he was in his mid 20s. OP, this kind of behaviour is never acceptable at any age, but it is DEFINITELY not acceptable at 50 freaking years old!"
701,Why are you putting up with it? It's clearly escalating.
702,"You should add this in as an edit, because it completely changes the context of your post. A good and thorough talk is still in order, and it’s okay for him and you both to feel a bit of resentment as long as it’s dealt with quickly. Can’t help feelings, but they must be dealt with. Maybe include the travel and moving expenses in your talk, as in “I contributed this here as a large expense/investment for us.” If he’s tracking dollars spent, those absolutely should be included in the equation. 

Please remember that time is valuable too. Money and chores and time spent achieving both all have worth and are contributions, as is time spent together. That may help balance the equation for both of you.

Also, I’m a little concerned with the part where he offered to pay travel expenses before you moved and did not follow through. That could be a big red flag, but maybe not. Why didn’t he do as he said he would? Why did you decide to cover that? That information may be helpful to know here. Good luck!
"
703,"Thank you for your insight and time. Because she has been complaining about it so much recently I have started to second guess myself, thinking maybe my approach to this situation has not been reasonable. I am a bit more encouraged to stand my ground on this issue. She has not given me an ultimatum yet, but if it gets to that point I think this rather great relationship might have to end. Thank you once again.

Edit1: I should have clarified she is trying to guess my password managers main password. I doubt she will be successful as I'm a quick typer and it's a 30 digit randomized password with letters, numbers, and characters. I change the master password   (the only password I ever memorize) every month."
704,[removed]
705,"I have taken note of all of this. I really did feel like I was the one in the wrong in this relationship, that I’m crazy and insecure and paranoid but I’m seeing the light thanks to this thread.

He doesn’t have keys to my apartment thank god. I hope he leaves me alone once I’ve ended things and blocked him."
706,"I did the math and according to my calculations, this guy gives approximately zero fucks about you. "
707,"Mate, that's puts a completely different spin on all of this.  I would go as fair saying to add this story as an edit to the OP.

Stealing meals is a pain in the arse and inconsiderate.  Stealing baked goods you made for someone else to give away is a completely different level."
708,"You might consider going for it anyway. You never know what emergency may come up and wipe your savings. You already pay into this assistance every paycheck you have ever worked. 

If you do not end up needing it by the time your next job begins and you receive your first paycheck you can donate it if you like. But do consider that this is assistance you currently have paid in for and are entitled to take. It only hurts when you don’t do it."
709,"&gt; He pushed me into a door and then dragged me by my hair onto the floor and kicked my face. 

OP I gasped when I read this. No form of abuse is okay, but this is dramatically awful and way worse than what I assumed from the title."
710,"Yup. Break up and kick him out. He's an addict, and he's not doing the first thing to sustain his recovery. It won't get better."
711,"As a guy(31) who watches porn I have to say, that is really messed up.

Ignoring your partner's needs for such selfishness is a huge red flag.  All the secrecy and manipulation is a pretty obvious sign how bad of an addiction he has.

I honestly think that it is really freaking inappropriate to have picture/videos of people you know and use as porn.  That is cheating in my opinion, but different people have different boundaries, but other peoples boundaries is a good thing to judge relationship compatibility with.

His amount really isn't such a huge deal to me.  If you care I can explain why.

My general rule is that if I can't take care of my wife whenever she wants I don't have the energy to take care of myself.  "
712,I'm going through a list of people in my head. Right now I think it's Ariana Grande. 
713,You have to start giving tough love. Stop telling her what she wants to hear and start telling her what she needs to hear. Ultimately the only one who can change her life is her. If she refuses to change and keeps letting her life slip away it may be time to move on.
714,I'd tell the dude what you heard. No one should have to marry someone like that
715,Of course he has money- he has barely any expenses! At least start charging him rent if your husband won't allow him to be kicked out. 
716,"No, don’t do this: you will only encourage him. Go straight for the restraining order."
717,Agreed! If only others in leadership roles could have the same empathy for their employees...
718,"Well, what a winner he is! You’re communicating your problems like an adult and he responds by ignoring you and the problem.

How is the rest of your relationship? Does he ignore you often?"
719,"Just throw this one away. It’s been six months and he thinks he can make decisions/ultimatums about your body which quite literally could be life of death? Just no.

I’m also ignoring the fact that he was going to try and change your mind because he clearly doesn’t respect your own choices. He’s just not worth it.

I’d consider telling people earlier for future relationships, but this is more just because it’s not just you don’t want kids, or not right now, it’s, you can never have kids because it puts your life at risk. The tubal ligation is almost a side piece to that point but people will not listen to understand unless they hear this "
720,"Absolutely this. ""I wish I had your support"" I would turn around their negativity back at them. Maybe some of this is rooted in jealousy over OPs good relationship or ease of immigration. "
721,"&gt; it’s also fine if OP doesn’t want to share a personal and traumatic thing with people who aren’t her friends.

Actually, yes, this is better advice than mine. I was reacting in anger when I read this post, saying she should tell all, but you're absolutely right. This is a much better answer. She doesn't owe anyone else an explanation.

&gt; Please do make sure you have a safe place to stay, that you get medical treatment, and that you file a police report.

That's it, right there.
"
722,"&gt; Practise having a set of prepared responses, or non-responses for BIL. Such as ""that sounds like something you'd say"", or a pointed look and an abrupt ""pass the bean dip"" (ie change the subject) or ""that's a really inappropriate thing to say at this place and time"" and depending if you can get away with it or not, a look of utter contempt and ""shoo"" or ""begone"" or ""I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? (repeatedly)""

My personal favorite: ""Ooh, you actually said that out loud? How embarrassing."""
723,"Do you really think your brother could be dense enough to not know whether she's in nursing school?? Like...that would be very concerning. They're married.

I would wait to be honest. She will get caught eventually if she's lying."
724,"He thinks you're being unappreciative?  What in the world would you possibly have to be appreciative of him for?  The only thing I see that he did for you was give you his laptop to watch Netflix.  Meanwhile, the two things you actually asked him to do: to buy you crackers so you could have something to eat that wouldn't make you sick, and to take his food somewhere else because the smell was making you nauseous, he completely failed to do.  Both of which are the bare minimum you should be able to ask of your significant other when you're sick."
725,Ooo i like this person who noticed 'mainly'. Important word right there. Lol
726,"&gt; As a Canadian, it's kind of funny to imagine the idea that living in the US right now is more desirable than living in Canada

As an American, I had the exact same thought. "
727,"You two need a come to jesus moment.   He doesn't see your value as a partner and he doesn't see your relationship as a long term commitment. 

If he wants more emotional labor from you, that's fine, but it isn't going to happen with your current work schedule.  If my husband saw me work that much when he could afford for me not to he would tell me to stop killing myself over it."
728,"Sounds 200% toxic, and it sounds like you’re well aware of it too. "
729,"Honestly, I would SUPER enjoy that party. Especially in front of your family: OMG, I'm so excited SIL and I are graduating!  ""Hey Mom, let's go see SIL graduate"" If there are specific projects (ie everyone has to take biology) to graduate as a nurse, then be sure to ask her thoughts on the class.


The more mature, responsible action would be to tell your Mom - hey Mom, some of SIL's comments about nursing school don't make sense - let's call the school together and confirm that she's a student, and if she is, then I'll let it go.  


Regarding the school, I believe most schools have a policy to not confirm attendance, so I don't know if I could believe their denial.  Doublecheck.


Also, if there is a subreddit for nursing students or nurses, ask if there are other ways to prove to a laymen, hey this person is a nurse."
730,You're entitled to your privacy and you definitely shouldn't give her access to it. Imo you should not even give her individual passwords. 
731,This. Could be a sign of a neurological issue or the onset of a dementia.
732,"&gt; Also he's said to me that he wouldn't have given up his rights if I had been a boy, because it's only boys that carry on family names, and as a girl I'll change mine when I get married anyway.

Here's a hard honest question; why are you trying to maintain a relationship with your father? Because reading that it shows exactly how much he cares about you. 

I understand you likely have reasons that you don't want to write down here (or thought they were not relevant to the immediate discussion) but I don't think I could take any parent figure seriously if they said ""I would not have given up my parental rights for you if \[something completely outside of your control\]""."
733,"As someone who’s bisexual, the fact that people weaponize their bisexuality like this against their partners infuriates me."
734,"Holy shit, this dude is awful. He's destroying OP's self esteem. What a creep.

&amp;#x200B;"
735,I think you buried the lede there with the whole recently-moved-in thing. Part of moving in together is negotiating what it means to share your life with someone else in a new way. Is this the only thing that he's pissy about or are there other small comments or attitudes he's putting on since moving in together? 
736,"I know you love your sister, but what she did is so unbelievably heinous and indicative of frankly psychopathic tendencies that you’d be very foolish to ever trust her again. You have to be missing a soul to fuck your mother’s partner. That’s utterly vicious and appalling.

Take some space from your sister for now, and do not offer her a shred of support or comfort in this. No lending money, no listening to her cry about it, no passing messages to Mom. And tell her, flat out, that what she’s done is inexcusable and has changed how you view her. Leave the door open if she chooses to better herself as a person, but if you see her making zero effort to fix herself, keep her at arm’s length. 

Gotta say, if she’d do this to your mother she would do it to you or to anyone else. I should hope you’re lucky enough to find a man who isn’t a complete pig, but I’d never invite her to stay at my house or meet my social circle for the rest of my life if I were you. 

Be there for your mom. Pick up the slack around the house, listen when she needs it, try to take her out to get her out of the house sometimes when the depression hits her hard. Walking in on your partner cheating is traumatic. Walking in on your partner and daughter is inhumanly painful and degrading in ways I can scarcely imagine. "
737,"I don't think it's ""crazy high"" standards to expect that there not be jackets all over chairs, mail never collected, crumbs everywhere, and clothes drying all over the place for days on end. When you've got 3 other roommates, you all need to be more respectful of each other's space than if you lived alone. 

Leaving stuff chopped up all over cutting boards and walking away, isn't being respectful of other's space. She shoved it to the side because it was *in the way* of other people using the space. Why do you need things you're snacking on to be left out in the middle of the table all day, rather than taken to your room? What if everyone left like 4 things out on the table each, all day every day?"
738,"You probably cannot say anything to ""ensure he stays away"" from you. What you can do is all ounce-of-prevention stuff. First, install cameras front and back plus a doorbell cam. Second, put in a catio or other fully enclosed secure outdoor pen for the kitties. Third, go looking for a lawyer now and retain them so that you are prepared if things escalate. Fourth, don't leave anything outside if you don't want it stolen. Make sure that your pool maintenance company knows that you have a hostile neighbour situation so that they can be extremely careful with keys and while they are servicing the pool. 

Fifth, and I know this sounds weird, but don't put your trash out until morning of, and if your bins are at all accessible, lock or chain them until you put them out."
739,People with glaring personality flaws and extremely high work ethic find it imperative to believe that hard work is the only important thing when it comes to finding success. They’ll force this narrative on anyone that’ll listen. Can you imagine how annoying she will be when you graduate and you are better at interviewing than she is so you find a job just as good as hers? This girl sounds like a nightmare.
740,"This is it exactly- She wants to be a stay at home mum so put no effort into her career. Now she can't afford it because the person she's relying on doesn't make enough to support her dream, and she has no savings or option for part time/from home work. She also wants a big fancy wedding and can't afford it.

She is just coming to the conclusion that she thought she was taking the easy/best/right path but she's not actually put any work in to make this work for her.

It also sounds like she's struggled with this for years &amp; OP has tried to help her previously with this, but she never followed through.

Now she's facing the consequences of her actions &amp; her anxiety is making her compare herself to the alternative- OP.

Honestly, she's fucked up and is trying to take it out on other people. The only way to win this immature game is to not play!"
741,"I just wanted to say you should not ""scold"" your wife. You should have a mature discussion about the issues you are having. "
742,"Thanks

Her husband and her own a sailboat and classic cars he refuses to sell. Thus, she needs to divorce and force him to sell so she can liquidate"
743,I’m a mom and if my grown son asked me to do any of those things I would firmly tell him to grow the fuck up. 
744,"I was divorced 17 years ago, still have my wedding ring, don’t wear it. I would consider it highly Inappropriate for my current partner to tell me to get rid of it.

745,"Oh Please- that doesn't mean they own you forever, and you know that.  Let them stay in a hotel and don't give it another thought.  You're an adult now.  "
746,[deleted]
747,Well that's a lot of kids to birth in less than two years whew. But yeah. I'm thinking this is likely how this is going to turn out. I've seen it before and I would honestly be an idiot to ignore it now.
748,"They're not being reasonable. 

It may be best just for family harmony to do as they wish, but it *is* overstepping their bounds and it's perfectly reasonable to let them know that it's your house, your rules, and if they're not comfortable with that, they can get a hotel room.  "
749,"You really need to get to the bottom of why your wife is frustrated with your current house.  You mention you out-earn her so I'll assume you have a traditional labor split as well. She is likely experiencing the day-to-day realities of your home in ways you never imagined.

That doesn't mean her plan is viable.  It just nudges you towards compromise- making sure BOTH your needs in a house is met, in a house that is budget-viable."
750,Yep. Cant ruin that for THEM? okay what about her? Itll be fun? no. No it wont be. 
751,"Everyone is trying to offer you suggestions, which you came here for. You are making excuses."
752,"Honestly, she sounds like a garbage person. Totally selfish and has no real empathy for you. Do yourself a huge favour and dump her. She will not make it easy- she’ll count on your sensitivity and caring and try to reel you back. You deserve much better."
753,Good question. Because I naively thought people change. Cringing at that now tbh. 
754,he says its school but it isn't. Its about control.

Of course.  You are also a grown woman who can see the obvious of what is in front of her.  

If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.  All you want to do it look at it and see if it's indeed a duck before you are forced to ASSUME it's a duck.  By failing to allow you to examine said duck, you must assume it's duckdom and react accordingly.

If it's a duck, tell him to duck off.

"
758,"This is really unacceptable. You say your dad loaned you both money for a vacation - am I understanding that correctly? If so, you basically vouched for your boyfriend there, that your dad should consider him trustworthy because you do. So that’s really embarrassing that your boyfriend has now broken that trust &amp; wants you to tell your dad that (1) it was a mistake to loan him money &amp; (2) he feels entitled to that money, anyway, in exchange for your dad no longer paying your rent. I think this really speaks volumes about the character of the person you’re dating &amp; that you should very seriously consider whether you want to continue dating him, or whether you want to expect better of the person you date. "
759,"There is only one solution : FIGHT YOUR DAD. 

I'm joking obviously, but your dad should respect your strength and career choice. He should also not be judging your boyfriend so harshly with such an outdated and frankly sexist attitude. It may seem cruel, but you need to nip this in the bud now. 

Until he can stop disrespecting you in all aspects, this includes backchat to your family, then he does not deserve to be a part of your life.  


Edit: I see some people calling for you to cut your dad out of your life completely. Guys, come on. It's not that easy to cut a parent out of your life forever. If that does end up happening (OP I'm not saying it will), then it has to be after all other avenues are exhausted. Nobody *wants* to lose a parent."
760,"Because sometimes people are awful. That's all you need to know.

If you grew up with decent parents, this is usually how you end up learning that there are parents who have no respect for their children's lives and boundaries, which is why you can't square it."
761,"I think your brother-in-law might be struggling with the idea that people do lose babies. For sometimes no reason at all.

For a lot of strongly religious people there's this idea that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. Bad things are not supposed to happen to family that you're on good terms with. So for a bad thing to happen to you, and to your baby (so sorry for your loss BTW) is likely hard to rationalise. It's probably bought home to him that he's powerless in his wife's pregnancy and he's reacting badly, because a lot of strongly religious people are used to that element of control.

He is still acting inappropriately. For your sake, I'd cut down on contact markedly. He seems self-absorbed at best. With the drinking thrown in... Urgh.

Wish you the best in future OP. "
762,"All I can say is that many guys your age are uncomfortable in similar situations. I’m not a guy, so I can’t say why that is. The only thing I can think of is it might be an age/maturity thing. When I dated at your age, I got shit from bfs for dressing to provocatively. It always built resentment because I dressed that way from the beginning, so there were no surprises. Why did I have to change, literally, for them?

I know it doesn’t feel that way, but other guys checking out your gf, even thinking obscene gross things, is not a big deal. She could be wearing sweatpants and theres still going to be dudes thinking sexual things about her, only difference is you won’t be overly conscious of it."
763,Real friends won't try and sleep with your boyfriend. Drop 'em both.
764,You’re being a doormat. Your boyfriend likes the attention he gets from her and you’re not putting your foot down. This is unacceptable. I went through the EXACT thing with my ex. He played dumb but he knew what he was doing. Don’t let your boyfriend get away with this. 
765,"&gt; I'm too tired to care most days

&gt;I keep rationalizing... that, on paper, my life seems great. I should be grateful and happy. I keep going back and forth thinking that I should say something, then changing my mind and not feeling strongly about it to do anything.

&gt; The only person I really have positive feelings about these days is my daughter.

Strongly seconding looking into the possibility that you have depression before anything else. Tiredness, lack of motivation, muted emotion generally, and rationalizing that your circumstances aren't really bad enough for you to have a problem? This all screams it.

If it turns out that you do, in fact, have depression or something similar, and you get help for that, it may not fix your marriage. It may still be that you and your husband aren't right for one another, and will need to separate and co-parent rather than fake it as a couple. But it's still something you need to figure out."
766,"Depends if he:

(A) likes to look at it everyday while crying, or has it hanging above your bed, etc.

(B) is just keeping it in a box or drawer somewhere."
767,"OK he is not your fiancé, he’s not your boyfriend, he’s just a cheater trying to have his cake and eat it. 2 years is not a long time. You need to have some self-respect and walk away. He does not love either of you, he only loves himself. Your post makes it sound like you can’t live without him and it’s simply not true, you’re just choosing not to in your blind infatuation. If you guys get married I can promise you it will end in divorce or infidelity."
768,"***Talk to your brother about it first***. If you say anything about this to your mom without your brother being aware of it, it may break trust between you guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please talk about this with your brother. Ask if his girlfriend is gonna keep it or abort it and how you can help **before** you tell your mother."
769,"I think you have 100% clocked him and his bullshit, but there is a difference between knowing something in your head and being able to live it (hence all the second guessing). That doubt will be there even after you pull the trigger on this breakup,but it will fade"
770,"This sounds pretty effing emergent to me. How did you describe the situation to the housing managers? Because depending on how they heard what you were saying, they may have heard ""I don't like my roommate's lights"" instead of ""MY ROOMMATE IS SECRETLY RECORDING ME IN PRIVATE AREAS.""

So, if you didn't make enough waves the first time around, call them back and tell them you FEEL UNSAFE in your living situation and see what can be done immediately. Don't yell, be nice, but be very firm. Your roommate is being hostile toward you and you have good reason to believe she is recording you. SAVE THAT TEXT FROM THE DAY YOU TOOK THE LIGHT DOWN - no ""therapy lights"" will have an app or notification pushed to it's owner when the thing is moved - it's an effing camera, no qualms about it.

If you get no traction there, call your parents, talk to your professors, ANYONE that can get you in contact with someone who can help you and FAST."
771,Not quite as skanky as the married man himself.
772,poorest house on the *best* block
773,"Do not pay him. It will never stop. 

Do what you need to do to protect yourself from your family. Change the locks and stop letting your brother barge in on you. And be prepared to lie. Frankly, it’s his word against yours, and he’s a known addict - addicts lie. He’s probably lied to your parents before. You could pretty easily pass this off as another lie. He has no evidence and no way to prove his claim. 

If you’re not ready to come out to them, you’re not ready. It’s okay to do what you need to do to keep yourself safe. "
774,"Uhh, I'd go get tested immediately."

what you can do is the two of you move to the cheapest rental possible. Get a master bedroom in a young person house share.

Be a model housemate, keep living cheap, and he can use the cash this downsizing frees up to pay his debt.


This is the extent you should help him eliminate the debt he accrued before you were in his life.


What would his plan be if you two never met?"

779,"I don't see a world where this relationship isn't already doomed some time in the future. Her relationship sounds exhausting and friendships shouldn't be exhausting.

That's for family members. "
780,"Yeah I think I need to start doing this. We've talked about it a little before and he just says ""well if they did it to me I wouldn't care at all"". I think he just expects everyone thinks the way he does which is another problem entirely (I got the impression he over estimates how close some of his friendships are). "
781,"How is your wifes pregnancy? Is she on bedrest, does she have inflammation etc where she can't walk or stand for more than 5 mins at a time? Does she have a job? ie, what does she spend all day doing if you are the one doing all the cooking and cleaning and baby prep? 

Like others, I think the workload is split unfairly here. I understand why you are frustrated. However, I dont think you should make it about weed. I think you need to have a serious discussion about division of labor and needing time for yourself to unwind. I think you are so angry about the weed issue because you are at your breaking point with everything else... as in, if you didn't already feel overwhelmed and taken for granted, the weed request might not bother you so much. 

It makes sense that right now, you do more than 50/50, because shes pregnant and thats a huge physical toll. But it still shouldn't be 100/0 unless she is on bedrest. "
782,"&gt; Sounds like you're simply not sexually compatible. 

I don't think any woman is sexually compatible with a man who doesn't put in foreplay and doesn't care if she orgasms."
783,"Honestly, yes it is likely that you will end up doing the majority of the work with kids too! That's my experience anyway."
784,Have you thought about taking up “fighting” as a hobby in some way? Like learning some kind of martial arts that you can get out your urge to fight with much less risk involved

786,"THANK YOU! Exactly this. I described all of the situations you mentioned to F since those are what I was worried about. The same thing goes for any person, whether it’s a female or male roommate, one of my own parents, or god forbid in-laws. 

I’m getting incredibly frustrated because at this point, there’s so much I can do. As I said F is refusing to set boundaries even if he sees me suffering. At this rate, I am crying everyday and losing a ton of weight (in a bad way). "
787,"Thats not okay ever.

Call the police and make a report please

Tell the co-workers the truth

please please please"

This is a gigantic red flag. She seems to be obsessed and unhealthy. Do not give up your boundaries on this."
789,"I have a sorta similar story, but I was lucky that I never hit rock bottom before I 'Quit drinking.' I just hated spending every weekend doing the same freaking thing, (drinking in a bar) and plus my body doesn't handle alcohol well. That being said, I do drink socially, buts it's always 2 drinks at the very most, and it's not a problem for me to turn down more drinks or stop.

I went through the same thing you did, with my friends group getting pissed at me, and guys I dated picking on me over it. So I stopped hanging out with them. Instead of spending my weekends at the bar, I went hiking, kayaking, road trips with all the 'beer money' I was saving not drinking. I met some really cool people, that lived the same lifestyle I did. **Surprise surprise! There are people in the world that either don't drink, or can actual drink responsibly!** 

I met back up with my old friends a couple years later. They were still getting wasted at the **same bars** every night. They thought I was snobby, I didn't give a crap. I had lived and experienced so many things in just those 2 years. I had actual memories! Instead of just a blur of hazy memories at the same bar with the same people, getting wasted and sick over and over again.

I get what your going through, and I know you say your SO is a great guy. But a great guy wouldn't be so judgemental about your decision to step away from drinking. He would respect that there isn't just one way to have fun, be social, and enjoy yourself. He seems to be one of those people that needs to meet the statistics quo to be happy. Sounds like he had a lot of growing up to do."
790,"Honestly, I think he's probably feeling less attracted to you but thinks that's a rude thing to say and so is dancing around it trying to persuade you to stop the activities that are causing the change in your physique.

When you sit down with him, I would make it very clear that you want him to be honest even if he thinks it will hurt your feelings, because ultimately it doesn't do anyone any favors to obscure the truth."
791,"I have a 4 year old daughter that copies everything I do including if I change my clothes she changes hers(Pajamas). If I take a nap she pretends to take a nap next to me.  She is hanging off of me or on to me or following me to every room of the house, she adores me.  It's just a little girl that is looking up to you and you are maybe filling a gap she has in her life,  don't freak out about it."
792,"He isn't saying, ""I didn't do it, I was nowhere near her"" He is saying ""She's confused"".. Yeah she's telling the truth.. he tried it and is trying to paint her to be drunk and crazy. "
793,"Dude, the mother of your kids doesn’t think child exploitation is a deal breaker for people in her life. That should be your absolute number one concern - protect your girls bc your partner is not going to. I’m sorry she cheated on you but there is a lot more to worry about here than infidelity."
794,"&gt;my other two roommates left their washing up on the two racks for the last four days,

Why?   This seems inconsiderate to me.  They should have had that down much sooner than four days.   

Beyond that, you really should make an attempt to keep the common areas clean.  If you want to leave a mug in your room, go for it but don't leave shit out in the shared spaces."
795,"Reach out when you are ready, not when they are ready. "
796,"Wedding planners don't have to be crazy expensive. I know a wedding planner and the way she puts it is that everything you pay her to plan your wedding will be recouped by the discounts she can get for you. You pay her to do the negotiation and be the bad guy so that you don't have to be. If you're too shy to tell the vendor that they got something wrong,?they'll do it for you! That really turned my opinion on wedding planning around. They're almost like an agent. They know the industry standards and will make sure you don't get fleeced. If you going to have a wedding that has the whole kit and caboodle you may as well get a planner, for your own sanity. "
797,"All this is batshit. So many red flags: can barely keep their heads above water but making her go buy cigarettes and demanding breakfast out. Then there is the controlling bullshit and his fucking little brat baby attitude. 

OP, girl, what the hell are you doing? Why would any self-respecting woman wanna build a life with a narcissistic, controlling, douchebag man baby like him? 

Get out. Build your own life. Take care of yourself. You don’t need that kind of crap. "
798,"I'm hearing a lot about these auto locks, I never considered it before. Thanks for the suggestion!"
799,"You are not mentally healthy. You are living way too much in your own head and not realizing how things come across, or thinking intentions matter more than actions. 

I would guess perhaps a personality disorder? I would suggest you get a psychiatric evaluation and start therapy. 

At every point in your post you make bizarre choices that you seem to think are very normal. I don't think you have any sense of how a person in a relationship ought to behave or feel. I can't strongly enough suggest therapy."
800,"My ex is a bartender and their places closed at 2. They could easily be there until 3:30 or 4 taking care of the bottles, money, daily cleaning tasks, etc. But then also he'd be up until 6 or 7 doing coke and getting drunk as fuck. Everyone there had at least 1 DUI. Anyway, I do kind of buy the story if having to hang around later after close when there's a successful bar in the restaurant. But 7 am?? Drugs or a new bf"
801,"So he wants to end a three year relationship because of this.  I mean even if you don't like it,  you can simply say it without threatening the relationship. Sounds like this guy doesn't want to be with you anymore and is looking for minor irritations to justify it to himself."
802,"We got to stop using ""maybe it's the culture"" to excuse crappy behavior. His wife is from that same culture and she was obviously upset so no I don't think it is just ""the norm"". "
803,"So, basically he's pissed because he didn't get away with trying to scam his way into VIP.

You're not wrong.  Don't invite him to anything ever again."
804,"""Thanks for proving my point."""
805,"I think the issue is shes drunk on freedom. what possibly would have gotten her in time out/strictly disiplined before at her parents house, she can do at your house with no consequences.

Basically, shes currently incapable of impulse control because her parents treated her like a 7 year old until she was 18. She has zero sense of responsibility or consequences for her actions outside of the parent disciplinary relationship. 

So you realistically have 5 options:
1. put her in time out.
2. Teach her the consequences of her actions eg. no money (no loans either), not allowed drive your cars, no guests, no pets. Charge her rent and a small percentage of bills (eg utilities and food) shut off the power to her room if you must.
3. Get her therapy
4. Kick her out.
5. Pass her back to her parents or another family member.

If she gets violent or overly argumentative in any way, call the police and force her to leave. (If she has the equivalent impulse control as a 7 year old she may resort to hitting)"
806,"HA. this reminds me of the time when my ex boyfriend didn't lock the door before bed, because he's a dumbass. guess who woke up to a robber in the bedroom? me! he is straight up endangering your life. i was so angry after this happened because MY safety was compromised due to his stupidity. i couldn't trust him for months. i always always always lock the door. it made me think he's an idiot and i lost a lot of respect for him. solution? idk. you should have extra keys. he shouldn't be taking your car. are you working? leave a note on the door, tell him that this is an absolute deal breaker that you cannot live with. enforce consequences. if he does it again, then \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. whatever seems reasonable. otherwise this is just going to get worse."
807,"My mom was always in our corner during my dad’s outbursts. He was exactly like this throughout most of my teenage years from like age 11 up, and he’d just shout at us constantly for stupid little stuff. Now I have a pretty fucking great long term memory, down to the exact outfit someone was wearing at a special moment legit 11 years ago. I remember stuff from when I was very young, and when I recount stuff people are like “how did you remember that?!”. Terrible short term memory though lol.

But I can hardly remember anything from that period of about 5 years of my dad’s constant shouting. My mom was in crippling depression, and my dad was emotionally abusive. But I cannot fucking remember any of it properly. My brain has blocked the vast majority of it out. I remember stuff from school, but honestly very little of my home life. 5 years of it almost erased except for glimpses. Because it was too damaging and too upsetting. It festered though, and led me to develop depression, even though it had ended, that I still struggle with 6 years later. 

Don’t do this to your kids. Don’t let this continue because the damage it can do to them is awful"
808,"This is NOT normal.  She's not over him. No one should have that much contact and communication with their ex even if they have a child together! This damages any hope of a healthy relationship with someone other than the ex.

&gt;  She tells me that there's nothing to worry about but all of this has completely blindsided me. 

LOL. Nothing to worry about. Except you texting your ex regularly, meeting up and ignoring your boyfriend when you said you were feeling down and then talking with your ex?!?!

Try to get her to see it from your point of view, would she like you constantly texting your ex, ignoring her for the ex, etc...? I doubt she'll be able to. At this point I'd probably break up with her and tell her to go be with her ex."
809,"And his next move is to ""punish"" her by telling her to cancel her trip. What kind of vindictive people are these? Of course they should get married -- oh! and have lots of children that they can punish and torture! WOW.  \*note: this is sarcasm."
810,"That much weed and takeout 2x a day every day is extremely expensive. I'd wonder if he actually has any money left, especially since he gambles."
811,Ok here’s the bottom line: do you want to date someone that thinks it’s morally okay to take financial advantage of your father? That’s the only question that matters. Your boyfriend has made his shitty decision. Now your decision is whether you still want this person to be your boyfriend. 
812,"I think you have bigger problems than the YouTube obsession. She sounds like she might be depressed if she’s lying around all the time and “too tired” to do things she has to do. Believing a stupid medicine will work better than a real medicine is a red flag. So is the fact that you support her, why does she not have a job or contribute to finances? "
813,[removed]
814,Then you know what to do.
815,You proceed by telling her absolutely not and that if she insists on being this irrational when you share something with her about your life you will not be sharing it with her in the future. 
816,"I'm an at-will, hourly employee so I don't think I qualify."
817,"Seriously, I’m extremely worried for OP. From the beginning when she expressed her concerns/boundaries to F and he responded “nope, it’s too late, they’re going to grow old with us”...it’s obvious he has *no* boundaries with his parents, and prioritizes their feelings over OP’s.

Premarital counseling should be a firm requirement before moving forward with the wedding/marriage."
818,"He is. This is abuse under the guise of you doing things to help his “anxiety.” He’s trying to control you and keep you obedient. Like this trip. He lies and says he’s okay with it then when you make the wrong choose for him and go - that means punishment. He’s conditioning you. Please, for your sake, leave. You’re not in prison and you don’t deserve to live that way."
819,"&gt; Like why she's 32, and working for years and doesn't have enough money to pay $300 rent.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, that's what I'm wondering too. I imagine it's something to do with being in debt + having a seasonal job + being bad with money. Maybe there's something bigger going on. I don't know."
820,"As an add-on comment, a lot of times these kinds of volunteer trips can actually harm the communities you go to, as well.

For example, I know people particularly love going to help orphanages. Especially the people who are doing it to ""look good/feel good"" because what makes you feel better than knowing you helped children in need, right?? Except you go there, you build these relationships with these children, and then you leave them and (most of the time) never really look back. And they've built these attachments to you and so that ""abandonment"" of you going home can actually have some real, negative effects on them, especially when it just keeps happening with new groups a couple times a year. "
821,"Right on! I struggled with this for a couple of months and finally just asked my friend out yesterday.

She said yes :)"
822,"Not only that, but is also so dismissive and rude to you when you are trying to help him. He doesn't sound that amazing. 

"
823,"You forgot, “Babe, my stomach hurts, make me a doctor’s appointment” and “babe, I don’t want to work, support us by yourself”"
824,"Girl. Come on. 

He knows if you have your own money you’ll drop him like a hot potato.

It’s now about you or enjoying your company or being around you. He just wants you trapped doing everything for him.

That’s not love or affection or partnership, it’s indentured servitude. 
"
825,"Dating someone you compete with can be good, or really bad.

But the ego shit definitely leads to bad.

So either sit down and talk about how work and careers are going to work with your relationship, or butt heads until someone gets hurt and you both develop a stupidly toxic relationship for stupid reasons and the relationship ends.

What I'm trying to say is communicate.

You feel one way, don't write about it on the internet, talk to him."
826,"Honestly, I’d probably wait a little bit to block him. That way if he sends threats or announces he’s coming over you can report it immediately and make sure you’re safe. 

The comment is spot on though, block this guy as soon as it’s safe to do it."
827,"I know, right? When I got to the 'left one at work' part I was like....no, this is something she is deliberately doing. She purposefully removed his meal so that he couldn't eat that instead. This is so not okay. 

Edit: in a comment further down, OP says she took four of his meals to share with her friends during another incident. So, yeah...this is pretty clearly actually sabotage for some strange reason "
828,"How many TBIs would you likely receive in the time it would take for ""the sport to leave you behind""?  How many is too many?

829,"At 25 years old, these types of impulse control issues aren’t just “boys will be boys “ issues, but signs of an immaturity that will require an almost maniacal desire to change.

Your boyfriend may or may not wish to cast out his poor emotional behavior, he could spend the next 10 years creating these types of drama filled events before he finally shows signs of change.

The question is, do you want to spend YOUR precious 10 years waiting on his ability to change?"
830,"&gt;both of them got the same classic American dream story of meetings their husbands in college, marrying after graduation and they are all 4 working on mom and dad’s business. Pretty lame if you ask me. 

That seems like a needlessly shitty aside.

Look, if your fiancé feels left out, but also has opinions and knowledge, *he needs to express that.* Yes in an ideal world your family would make an effort to include him, but it seems they're not going to. As such it's on him to get involved. Or indeed to just stay quiet and listen.

I've got friends who love sport - I don't care about it myself. But when they talk about it I take an interest, listen, pick up bits and pieces, and ask questions where I can. If your fiancé doesn't follow the conversation, he can ask and (hopefully) learn more.

Ultimately you can't make them like him, but I don't see why cutting them off is on the table. Doesn't seem like they hate him either. At the same time he's a functioning adult who shouldn't need you to facilitate conversation for him - it's been 3 years, it's his responsibility to get to know your family as much as it's theirs to get to know him. "
831,"I wish I could!! My college doesn’t have RAs and instead has something called “self-run housing” It’s supposed to let us feel more independent, but I really wish I had an RA right now. The closest thing I have to an RA is the housing department managers, but you need an appointment to see them if it’s not an emergency. They didn’t consider my situation an emergency and my appointment is another 6 weeks away. :("
832,That dude put HIS HANDS ON YOUR SISTER tell your fiance that his hurt feelings are no excuse for being rude and violent and making an event that was about you and your fiance all about him. I wouldn't marry a dude who would defend behavior like that. How will he treat you if he defends this kind of behavior?
833,"&gt;I don't want to change.

As a trauma survivor myself, I get it. Why would you want to change when the cocoon you've carved out for yourself is familiar and safe and feels like you? 

But you can't sustain relationships that way. It's important to go to a therapist, not for him, but for *you*. Because if you don't face these things eventually you will end up alone, which sort of screws up the whole cocoon thing.

Spend some time really examining whether you want to be married or not. Because right now you're prioritizing nursing your pain over your relationship."
834,"He’s probably not insurable, at least for life insurance purposes.

835,"That's a deal breaker ladies.

Honestly, your relationship is rocky, you're constantly fighting and he has made it clear he values your asshole more than your relationship. I mean, what exactly are you getting out of this?"
836,"Your wife is prioritizing her abusive mother over her husband and children. This is incredibly unhealthy for everyone. If she's allowed to stay, your kids will suffer immensely and your marriage will likely end. Think of your children for a minute - their lives have been disrupted and their home is no longer a safe place. They will 100% resent you both if you allow them to grow up in this environment. You guys do NOT need to ""suck it up and deal"" with being berated and taken advance of in your own house. Please step up and take your family back. Get yourself a lawyer and figure out how to get her out of your home as soon as possible. Your MIL is a victim of her own choices, your wife has no reason to feel guilty. What does her therapist say about this situation?"
837,"I dont think it's normal to expect his family to reach out to you. I mean, he is her son, so supporting him during the break up is her priority. It's not her bussiness to contact you now, I think it could be interpreted as nosy. If I broke up with my fiance, I would find it weird and innapropriate if his parents contacted me.

Edit: a word"
838,Send her an Instagram break up
839,File for child support.
840,"Also OP I work in the film and television industry. People's fortunes change abruptly and drastically all the time... for good and for bad. Just because your friend got cast on a TV show doesn't mean she's suddenly made it and it's going to be all smooth sailing for the rest of her life. She could find herself unemployed next year while you're finding your own success.

Nothing in this industry is for certain. Nothing. People who ditch their ""little"" friends after they make it are not only jerks,  but also really, really stupid."
841,"My reaction was the same. When I read the text message conversation, you definitely did not come across like a pleasant person to live with. I wouldn’t want to live like filth either, and if I was busting it to get the kitchen and other areas clean, the least a roommate could do was fake a little more enthusiasm for cleaning up a mutual bathroom.


They shouldn’t have thrown away your stuff. But this isn’t a situation where you 100% have the high ground. "
842,"I can sort of understand her being upset for you leaving so suddenly during a wedding, especially if you were a groomsman. However, the fact that your cousin was in trouble and she knows that, but is still pissed at you is definitely a red flag. At the end of the day family comes first. 

What if she was the one that was in trouble, and was crying and called you for help? Would she be okay if you were like, ""yeah I'll be there in a few hours, I'm at a wedding"". I highly doubt it."
843,"He's definitely a Nice Guy... From the part about how they've been friends for years and he was supportive of her about the no kids thing, to the encouraging her to break up with her ex, not to forget he was convinced he could change her mind about the no kids thing (not that she would change her own mind), the so-called mixed messages she's been sending about wanting or not wanting kids, and last but not least the one more way her ex has ruined her.

These points by themselves are yellow flags at best, but when you group them all together he's the quintessential Nice Guy who cares more about his idea of OP, than about OP herself. OP should not just dump him but also remove herself from him entirely. He was never truly her friend. "

847,"&gt;How would I find a custody lawyer? Is this really something that would need a lawyer?

If they get this in front of a judge you most definitely need a lawyer. Child custody is not a DIY subject. If Leah's parents want to discuss custody, decline. If you get scary letters from law firms, stay calm and find a lawyer of your own. If you receive a court summons, DO NOT ignore it!! Failing to show up to a hearing often means you lose by default.

Google your state and ""state bar."" You should find options for searching for attorneys by specialty or getting referrals. Most lawyers won't charge for a brief consultation, so talk to a few and don't feel pressured to hire someone you're not comfortable with. Check if there are any father's rights organizations in your area that specialize in custody issues. Some will offer legal advice at lower costs, or on payment plans.

I know you don't want to face all your emotions right now, but ask your attorney if a few counseling sessions would affect the case. You're dealing with a lot of stress and you don't want your daughter's grandparents to claim you're not emotionally able to care for your daughter.

Also, check if your employer offers an employee assistance program. Some will give you a few low cost sessions of counseling or legal advice.

&gt;Can they really take her from me?

Depending on your state laws, they could get a visitation schedule, but they would have to prove you were extremely unfit to take custody away. If you post in the legaladvice sub and include your state, they can give more details about what to expect if this goes to court. "

849,"I know you were coming from a good place, but the last thing he wanted to do is ruminate with his car buddies when he just had to sell his car, his baby. I know how he feels. I finally just bought my dream car after having saved up forever, looked for over a year before I found it, made one payment on it, and somebody pulled out in front of me and it's totalled. For the past few weeks the last thing I want to do is be around the people in my car group because I can't share the car with them any more. Anyway, he'll get over it, but for now, let him feel down about it. He's crushed, but at least he didn't refuse to do it. "

851,"You’re going for 15 days. It’s not like you’re going to be there long enough to develop any meaningful relationship with someone. So at that point it would be a one night stand, which doesn’t seem a whole lot different than a one night stand at home. I think pausing your relationship in ways like not contacting each other would help with clearing your head/ personal growth but I don’t see how sleeping with someone else has anything to do with it honestly. Not to mention there’s no way your relationship would be the same. Sleeping with other people while on an unrelated breakup or break is one thing but this just doesn’t seem like it would end well at all"
852,"My father used to act the exact same way: he'd come home everyday in a terrible mood and snap because of random things, as if he was LOOKING for a reason to be mad. 

I think your husband's clearly going through something and is not telling you. In my father's case it was a lot of problems on his side of the family and issues at work. Now I understand he was going through a lot and felt he had nobody to talk to, but at the time I hated his guts for treating me and my mom that way - and that's a really shitty feeling to have for your own father. 

Make sure to sit and talk to your husband about what's really going on, maybe try counseling, anything that will help him deal with his issues in a non violent way. Also (since I've been on the receiving end of that situation), try and make a point if that's really the way he'd like his children to remember him, because even though things turned out fine with my family, I'll never forget how bad those fights were.

Look for the book ""It's all good hair"" I found that helpful for learning how to braid and take care of DD1's hair.

You want sulfate free shampoos and conditioners.  Don't brush her hair, you want a wide tooth comb.  Cantu is a good brand that's pretty affordable and they have stuff that's for kids, so you can still use tear free shampoo. Don't shampoo her daily - once a week should be good.  Maybe more often if she gets Spaghettios in her hair.  Leave in conditioner is a good thing. 

And look out for dry skin - you'll want to make sure she doesn't get ashy. 

There should be ""ethnic"" hair products suitable for children available for your girl at Target or Wal-Mart.

866,"I used to work with adults with developmental disabilities in a community living environment. These are homes, staffed 24/7 to assist with medication, hygiene, social activities, everything. I loved it and it really gave me an appreciation for these services and the people who work so hard to make life enjoyable for all. I'm not sure if there are citizenship/residency requirements because I know most of the funding comes from the state and SSI, but it certainly be worth looking into! Some parents are reluctant to have their children be cared for by strangers. I get it, I'm a mother. But knowing what I know first hand, I wouldn't hesitate even for my own. 

Another thing I learned too is that we are all one accident away from an intellectual disability. Some of my clients were born typical. It is ok to be honest about our limitations as caretakers, but it could be you or your BF that needs care at some point. Know what services are available and  use them. Do onto others as you would want done to you."
867,"&gt;they insist on leaving me out which extremely angers me and I feel like I have no other choice then to cut contact with them

No other choice except, apparently, **cutting down your drinking.** I mean if my friends told me I had a drinking problem and started excluding me because of it, my first response would be ""fine, I'll stop drinking for X period of time to prove to you that I don't have a problem"". Your response is to cut them all off and make new friends. Overreaction much?

This whole post is full of defensiveness and justification (""I don't get drunk"" ""I like the taste"" ""it's my favourite hobby"") and nowhere do you consider just cutting it out for a while to see how it goes. I mean you flat out say ""I rarely drink until I pass out"". Drinking out until you pass out **ever** is a bad sign, and isn't compatible with ""I don't get drunk"". Which is it? How often do you pass out? 

The appropriate action is to quit drinking for a month - if nothing else it'll prove to them you can do it and they're making a fuss about nothing. If you can't do it... Well, you've got a problem. "

871,"Honestly, the fact that “being successful” is her biggest goal in a partner says maybe you guys’ lives aren’t very compatible currently. Not saying she’s wrong or you’re right OR vice versa. Just, sounds like she has some very specific desires in a partner, and you aren’t going to be able to meet them, through no fault of your own either. Sounds like at least you guys are communicating well, there’s got to be some gear that’s slipping on ringing that compromise. Maybe address where you guys could see yourselves, best, worst, and most likely scenarios, and move from there to work for the best, plan for the most likely, and prevent the worst."

873,"Boxes are actually the ideal way to package wine.  It's more environmentally friendly than glass bottles, and the wine you don't drink in one sitting isn't exposed to air so it doesn't oxidize.  Due to the general snootiness associated with wine, it hasn't taken off, but there are solid brands like Black Box.  It's not all Franzia.  And even Franzia is not really worse than bottled wines like Sutter Home that some people do enjoy drinking."
874,"Hey, he is mentally ill and reasoning or hinting to him is not going to ever work.  You seem to be way ahead of the average poster here in being willing to and capable of confronting a problem directly, so you've got a good chance.  Everything you've done so far - ignoring him yelling, shutting down rants when he corners you, and firmly telling him to leave you alone when busy is exactly the right move.  Don't give an inch.  A restraining order if he comes to your property uninvited is not a bad idea, but if he's just yelling nonsense (not threats) across the street then there isn't much you can do.  Look into a privacy fence, don't let the cat outside, and don't worry about his 911 calls.  He is doubtlessly well known to the cops as a crazy person and I don't think you'll ever have much to worry about there.

A little piece of me died inside when you described paying $100k for a single family in a metro area.  I paid almost 3 times that amount for a 2 bed condo in the middle floor of a 100-yr old triple decker, on the commuter rail line, in metro Boston.  You have an amazing investment there, and you should be fighting to protect it.  You can outlast this guy.  "
875,"Had no idea Gaston actually managed to produce children after falling off that cliff. 

You might end up having to take your dad to court. Someday he’s going to take a swing at someone and you don’t want that someone to be a coworker (or worse, a student). Make it crystal clear to him that it is UNACCEPTABLE for him to make threats the way he did and that the damage it’s done to your trust in him is going to take a very long time to repair, and that’s IF he apologizes and toes the line from now on. 

If he refuses, it’s time to take a long break from him. No birthdays, no holidays, no phone calls, nothing. This isn’t to punish *him,* it’s for *you* to regain a sense of equilibrium and security in your life. It’s for you to invest time and energy in the people who respect you. Your dad isn’t on that list, so he doesn’t get your time and energy until you decide you’re ready to give him another chance. Which, after this shit, could very well be “never.” "

To be honest it sounds more than a little creepy that you still claim she is, have you been to therapy about this? She has probably moved on a while ago but hasn't made a clean break with you for some reason. The way you are still latching on to a relationship such as you have described makes me wonder if it is fear on her part. You need therapy asap to help you move on from this and accept she has gone."

885,"Yeah, fuck I felt bad for her. I think she’s owed an explanation as to OP’s unique abuse and the effect it’s had on him, and a promise that OP will put the work in to manage his anger. If she’s still afraid of him when her batshit sister sits her down, nothing good will happen."

887,"Her throwing out your stuff is totally wrong and she should compensate you for it. Either try to find out how much your sister spent on the gift or look up the cost of the mask online. I would make sure to tell her this; she might not have actually thrown it away but is immaturely trying to teach you a lesson. 

People may disagree with me but you need to stop leaving stuff on the kitchen table. Your roommate isn’t mature enough to communicate that it bothers her, but it clearly does if she is moving your stuff constantly. If your laptop or hard drive is so delicate that it could be broken if it was moved why was it left in a common room where spills can happen?  What if your roommate wants to use the kitchen without worrying about ruining something important of yours?  

A kitchen table is the worst place to put electronics or delicate stuff because people cook and eat there. I can understand her moving the mask because she doesn’t want to be liable if it’s damaged when she’s eating or cooking. That doesn’t give her the right to throw it away. "
888,"Introversion/Extroversion isn't about what you enjoy, it's about how you recharge. It's about what relaxes you.

You can be introverted and still enjoy a very active networked job with a lot of friends and intensity. But you come home and spend a most nights in quiet afterward to recover.

You can be extroverted and still enjoy chill activities without a lot of busy intensity, like chill horseback riding or intense martial arts. But you spend your leisure time getting out of the house and stay active in order to recover.

The only way I see the two of you working together is if you start becoming okay with doing your own thing more often than not. You go out and stay busy, he stays home and chills. You plan to do things together only when one of you has the excess energy to delve out of their comfort zone and join your partner in theirs. You let him stay home and cook, you go out running etc, and then you come home to eat with him. He doesn't need to be with you all the time to be your partner. You just have to support each other."

892,"As someone who has had a somewhat similar situation, I can tell you that he will continue to hold the fact that you kept her over your head.  Every time he’s mad or upset with you, “well you chose to keep her”. If you say you’re tired because she didn’t sleep through the night “well you chose to keep her”. If you have to go to the store to get formula and you really just want to sit and read a book or something rather than going to the store, “Well you chose to keep her” it will be a never ending cycle and eventually he might also start placing blame on you and blaming her for things babies can’t be blamed for. It’s won’t be good for you and it won’t be good for her to grow up around that kind of attitude. "
893,"Please understand that this guy will kill you the next time he raises his hands, and feet to you. He basically went to try and crush your skull under his boot. Show up to work tomorrow and talk to your manager. Tell them what happened. You being alive is more important than you not being presentable for a meeting. You'll have other meetings in the future. Please get as far away from this guy as possible. Get yourself into counseling. This guy has done a number to your psyche and you have probably been living under a Stockholm Syndrome for such a long period of time; you saying ""we weren't even arguing that bad,"" leads me to believe he uses you as a mental and physical punching bag quite often."

They don’t have to take this lying down, you know.  Their parents would be in a pretty shitty place if they suddenly ended up with no sons, too. The real, long term answer isn’t really anything you can do,  other than be supportive and welcoming, but what their own kids do. 

Btw, if your parents are open to inviting over he kids and their boyfriends for dinner, holidays etc, that will start some fights but it’s ultimately the right decision. That’s up to them though. "

898,"OP please, please take this to heart. I'm sorry to be so blunt but the truth is that your mil abandoned your wife to an abusive parental figure and now your wife is abandoning your children to an abusive parental figure. You cannot let this happen. If you have to take your kids and move away from your wife, do it! She needs to see how drastic the repercussions will be to comprehend how serious this is! "
899,"Yes it's perfectly normal to feel humiliated. You were made the butt of several very rude 'jokes' in a situation where you couldn't fight back and the people you would most have expected to have empathy for you and be on your side, went along with the 'joke'.  It's also incredibly hard to defend yourself when the whole room is in on it. 

On the one hand it is absolutely not OK for people to behave like that. On the other hand this isn't the last asshole you'll meet in your life so it's worth working out how to handle it in advance. No one ever comes up with the perfect thing to say when put on the spot for the first time - the people who seem to have just, sadly, had more practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

To your girlfriend: I don't like your uncles jokes and if he does that again I'm not going to smile and go along with it.  If you laugh when someone is that rude to me, I'm going to assume that playing along with a joke is more important to you than how I feel.  

To your parents: I hate that girlfriends uncle was so rude and I'm actually pretty angry on your behalf. I wish you hadn't felt like you had to go along with it.

To your girlfriends uncle or any idiot like him who ""literally says: 'I hope you guys split up soon'.""

""Wow"" 

""Oh man they really weren't joking when they said you had no tact""

&lt;Said with really over the top cheeryness and a big smile&gt; ""That's a shitty thing to say, thanks I guess!""

""Haha I think you suck too!""

""Hah So you must be the weird uncle they were telling me about!""

""Seriously?""

""Exactly as charming as I remember""

""Wow. I guess every family has one!""

""Do you ever wonder if everyone laughs because they're embarrassed for you?"" (Delivered very courteously)

""Well I hope you die before the wedding then!"" (OK this one is probably not wise, but can you imagine his face?)

902,Best answer. OP be proud of yourself. If they like him so much they can go date the projecting cheating jerk. Way too many people stay with a partner like this because of low self worth and sunk cost fallacy. You rock.
903,"This is almost exactly what I did! My Asian mother-in-law wanted the cash gifts from our wedding. I said, ""Fine, but in my thank-you notes, I will let everyone know that you took the money."" She didn't like that at all and quickly abandoned her plan."
904,Couples therapy absolutely. I think you didn’t realize it was cheating because the vast majority of people don’t consider it to be cheating. 
905,"He was 100%, without a doubt, emotionally cheating on you with this woman for the entirety of your relationship. Let that sink in for a sec.

And I'd bet my right arm he physically cheated as well:

&gt;G and boyfriend have travelled together a few times. Most recently, they travelled with a few other mutual friends to another country to go for a concert. **They shared the same bed** and were going to travel without the other friends for about 5 days of the trip.

Look, their relationship was and is clearly inappropriate. Why do you think she hated you so much? Because you were taking away her boyfriend. Why do you they stopped talking when she started dating someone? **Because G's new boyfriend is probably a person with normal boundaries who wouldn't put up with his girlfriend dating your boyfriend** and him at the same time. Which is what they've been doing.

Your Bf's obsessive behavior since they ""broke up"" only confirms how attached he is to this woman. You will always come second to her. And let's not forget he has been cheating on you, even if you deny the physical cheating (and let's be real here, he didn't go on a trip with a female friend who hates you and not allow you to come on the trip and also shared a bed with her and not hook up), the emotional cheating is out in the open.

Leave him and find someone who makes you their #1 priority. You'll never be this guy's top priority.


Also, I saw in your post history that you've had concerns about this woman before and his relationship with her. How many times do you need to have these red flags waved in your face before you realize he's cheating?"
906,"You make the concious decision to look, and its clearly very obvious and if its that obvious its probably making the women you're staring at feel uncomfortable too. Have you considered being more discrete?"
907,"She sent her nude picture to other guy which happened to be her ex also? Seriously, not worth it. She is the one who break your trust. Talk to her and leave. Dont ever feel guilty about it."
908,"To back this up, even if he's not actually cheating the sneakiness is a red flag in and of itself."
909,"&gt; now that people are defining sexual assault as a man continuing to grind and thrust on top of you while you lay there rigid and unwilling but not fighting back 

This is not a newfangled definition of sexual assault, and denigrating the experiences of other women because you believe you have experienced worse is not healthy. I was molested as a child in the manner that you describe, and I resent how cavalier you are being about it, but I also understand you're hurting and working through something yourself, and that's ok.

To anyone reading this, if you received uninvited, nonconsensual sexual attacks or abuse and found yourself incapable of fighting back, that *does not* mean that your experiences are something to be discounted, or that you should just accept or get over it because ""worse things happen."""

912,"I would be mortified if I were you. In college my friend group had someone like this in it. He would mooch even when what he was mooching was in short supply or the person really needed it. If he was called out he would just laugh and brush it off. To him it was all in good fun because we were ‘like siblings’ (we were not, also my siblings are much more considerate.) Eventually everyone stopped calling him to come out with us and froze him out. To this day when we see each other and someone mentions him, it is clear people still think really poorly of him. 

Maybe you could show your guy this thread so he can hear other people’s opinion of this behavior. "
