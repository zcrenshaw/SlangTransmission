0,"She’s asking you to be frank. Be frank. “If you want to be an attorney, you’ll need to get into an ABA accredited law school. That will require an LSAT score of ~x and a GPA of ~y.” 

These are just numbers, facts, and are not a judgment."
1,"At this point, if you respond you have only taught her that it take 8 months of flower subscriptions and 5 new phone numbers to get you to take the bait. She will intensify her efforts to reach you if you break no-contact. It WILL send you back in your recovery. Time is moving forward honey, you keep marching on into your new and better future. Looking back will drag you down. Don't give her that power."
2,"OP, I am scared for your child reading this. Your wife doesn't sound like she's just suffering from PPD. The paranoia about being stalked makes me wonder if she's actually experiencing some postpartum psychosis, or getting close to it. I don't think you should leave your baby alone with her at all until she gets treatment.

I also think it's time to stop trying to convince her to seek help. You need to book an appointment and drive her to it. The time for her to choose to help herself has passed. The priority now needs to be ensuring your baby's safety, and I think an ultimatum is totally appropriate here: Either she gets the help she needs, or you'll take legal measures to ensure your daughter isn't being neglected or harmed."
3,"I had a friend back in school who really really wanted to be a lawyer to help people (and probably because I'm old enough that Ally McBeal was a thing then.) 

She was incredibly well meaning and incredibly unsuited to law and wasn't going to get the grades at all. She had a real wobble when she failed to get into a law degree and struggled with the knock in confidence so didn't achieve as well at uni than she wanted.

We lost touch until a few years ago when I bumped into her. She had become an extremely well respected welfare advisor who I met up with through my charity work in that field. She'd taken her interest in legal wording, desire to help and her level of comfort and over the years had become exceptionally good at a job that fulfilled all her teenage ambitions just from a totally different way of approaching it that being a lawyer.

I've also met lots of people through that interest who started out wanting to be lawyers who became client advocates, advisors, paralegals, support workers, clerks and all kinds of jobs that need a love of thinking in a legal way but aren't exactly like being a lawyer.

Very few of them regretted the diversion unless their original motivation had been making big bucks in a law firm and all them are as important to the legal system as the ones the public think of when they think legal profession."
4,"Can you tell her that you want to replace your ring with something more adult and professional, and want to put your previous ring in a shadow box on your bedside table, or frame it? Just tell her it’s purely about the aesthetics and you want something to match a more nature style "
5,"Do you have family you could stay with for awhile?

I don't think you should try to cancel your house sale (and saying that you could do it, but you'd be sued for thousands if you did, doesn't make a lot of sense to me).

I think if possible, you should get away for awhile from your husband and this area that's making you so unhappy, take a breather, and then regroup and figure out a new plan. And your husband should only be involved if he fully takes responsibility for how much he fucked up by not even *listening* to you and has a complete 180 in attitude. "
6,"I think ANY contact from you will be seen as a win from her standpoint. I would go to the nearest police station  and ask very nicely if a police officer (or 2) could pay her a quick visit and tell her to leave you alone or face (vague) legal consequences. If you explain the circumstances and make it clear it would be a favour to you, they might just help you out.  Good luck and well done for getting through this."
7,First of all a death of a family member especially if it was her dad might take longer than a year to get over. My SILs father passed away months before her wedding. Our family had a little locket with SIL father's face in it that was placed on her wedding bouquet so he could 'walk' her down the aisle. I do think you need to express to her that your dad speaking at your wedding would mean alot to you and to him. Best of luck. 
8,"This seems super simple to me, don't leave your kid alone with people who want to pretend she is theirs.      

Let her visit for sure, but with you there too. Done deal. If they offer to be alone with her again, decline. If they push for a reason why, tell them why. "
9,"OBGYN nurse here who has seen many a manic/psychotic episode in post partum patients. And OP’s wife is right at the age for certain mental illnesses to pop up. 

OP, don’t just call the receptionist and schedule an appointment with the OBGYN, ask to speak to the nurses and go from there. "
10,I would be postponing the wedding at this point until she figures out how to manage her mental health. That means a combination of therapy and meds. Do not expect any of this to get better unless your fiancee decides to start taking care of her mental health.
11,"Oh man, I hate how dismissive two of the other posters are, saying you can't be responsible for 10K people. You are in a position of prison management, where your decisions directly affect those 10k people. This means you are responsible for them, and arguing otherwise is simply pedantic.

Based on how you wrote you post, your bf comes off as very rude and unempathetic. However there are always two sides to a story, and there are a few things you may be doing (or may not). 

- Do you rant about your job every day? How frequently do you end up talking about it, or complaining about it to your partner? My ex had a job with an element he didn't like, and he would complain about it a few days a week, sometimes for a minute, sometimes for 10 minutes. After a couple years of this, it really started to drain me and I got kinda fed up with what felt to me like constant complaints. There are other things about his job that are good-- I just wanted him to focus on those good things. 

- Do you insist your job is harder? Or that his job isn't hard? Are you the one who is actively comparing who has the harder job? Nobody likes a one-up, even if you legitimately have a one-up scenario. 

- When talking about your job, do you ever have good things to say? Or is it always something negative? If so, this is going to be really too much frustration for a partner to bear. Also, if it's always bad stuff, then you probably need to be in a different position. OR you need to go to therapy to learn how to appreciate the good stuff and not dwell on the bad stuff.

If it's none of those things, then your bf is just being a jerk. Personally, a bf who hangs up on me because he's annoyed would be a deal breaker for me. "
12,Thank you. That was really uplifting to hear. You are right. 
13,"&gt; I told him from the beginning that I would leave if he ever did that to me.

And now he has so it's time to follow through. Leave.

If you need more of an incentive, let me lay out the red flags:

- Cheated on his last girlfriend

- Matched with a girl on Tinder pretending to be single and arranging to meet up with her

- Lied to your face when you confronted him

- Turned his cheating around on you

Six months in? That's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
14,"Honestly, is there another way for her to be involved with the law without being a lawyer? What part of it is attractive to her? "
15,"Tell her what you told us:
&gt;Law is saturated, the fact that I landed something is a testament to luck and not necessarily anything else. I had really good grades and worked hard, but there are others who also did and are selling insurance and financial plans to retirees. 

Especially since:
&gt; my SIL keeps asking me to be frank with her; her parents have asked me to be on the level and my wife thinks I am keeping something.

Everyone wants your honest assessment here. They might not like it at first, but it could save your sister in law a lot of heartache if she listens."
16,"Call the police next time he yells at you. In fact I would call to make a report now. Also call the police next time you hear crashing sounds from the apartment, and every time you hear such sounds. Third, you should invest in some cameras - both on your apartment door, and ones that will capture any confrontations outside. This is going to get worse before it gets better - be prepared with evidence in case you need a restraining order.

You are helping those kids. You're one of the only advocates they have, it seems. Don't give up on it. Their current living situation is traumatizing them."
17,I think you’ve hit the nail on the head about what sort of person she is. I know for a fact she’ll take it as some sort of victory if I open up a conversation so that’s why I’m hesitant to go there. I am seriously considering the police as an avenue. Thank you. 
18,"A quote comes to mind that I really like, 

""Dont cling to a mistake just because you have spent a lot of time making it."" -Aubrey De Graf

I don't think your boyfriend was a mistake, as you have said, you have had many great years...But maybe its run its course.  Invested time can make it really hard to walk away.  So for your boyfriend it should probably be, ""Dont cling to a dead relationship just because you have been in it a really long time.""...I think you are right that he has checked out and is just being complacent.  "
19,"Listen, this is psychosis and these are the situations that end with a woman killing her child.

I'm worried about you and your mental load as well.  This situation is a powder keg.  You **need** to seek professional help.  Immediately. "
20,"Hi, replying to the top comment but I have carefully read all the comments.

I got in contact this evening with the psychiatric unit at a well-reputed hospital in our city after realizing how this was more urgent than I'd assumed. I was advised to bring her in to the ER immediately for an evaluation. I'll be trying to do that tonight. 

I just got back from dropping my daughter off with my wife's friend--wife had fallen out of contact with her after the birth and her friend was shocked to find out from me what was going on, but happy to take care of our daughter for the next day or two while I'm busy. Her friend hasn't had a child so I was a little anxious leaving her with her. But this woman knows my wife the best, my handful of friends are all single dudes who like going out late and drinking and such, our only family nearby is my dad who like I said is dealing with mental illness himself right now, and overall this friend seemed the most trustworthy. I will be checking in with her often of course.

I probably won't have much time to come back to this tonight as I'll be trying to bring my wife to the hospital but I'll read new responses as I can. Thank you all SO MUCH for the information and advice about psychosis after childbirth."
21,The confusing part is it’s like OP wants James to be a fill in dad but he can’t make any decisions. The whole thing is a bit weird. I’d say cut both of them off as it’ll only get more confusing 
22,"If he's not outright projecting out of embarrassment, it could be genetic incompatibility. I had a roommate tell me once I always had BO. I don't sweat much, don't have a physical job, shower daily, wash my clothes after each wear (except things like coats and jeans of course) and don't let them sit in the washer and get that musty smell. I wear antiperspirant and usually a scented lotion. I didn't see HOW I could stink. 

Yet she insisted it was so bad she could smell it on furniture and in the house when she came home.

I asked friends. I asked my SO. I even asked my boss. ""Be brutal,"" I said. ""If I really have this issue I had NO CLUE and I want to fix it. You won't hurt my feelings."" 

They all swore up one side and down the other I absolutely did NOT STINK. My boss was even like ""How many times have I complimented you on your perfume/lotion?"" and she was right. She had. 

There was just something about my natural scent that my roommate found incredibly offensive. (We were good friends, there was no reason for her to be mean or passive aggressive about anything amd she brought it up kindly.) "
23,"OB/Gyn here. I’m very concerned by what you’ve written. Here is my advice.

1. If there are any weapons in the home secure them.
2. Take the baby to a trusted friend or family member. Now. Bring the pack and play, cloths, diapers, and formula for at least a few days. 
3. Do not allow your baby to be in the presence of your wife (especially alone) until she has been throughly evaluated by a mental health professional. Others have given good advice on how to get this ball rolling either through your OB, the local ER, or local crisis hotline.

I wish you the best. "
24,"Sued for thousands and still on the hook for mortgage payments...oh and they already spent the money they would have made from the sale.

OP, cancelling the sale would be a guaranteed way to ruin you both(think of your baby) financially. "
25,And then don't talk about replacing hers!! Instead tell her you'd like to get her a new piece if jewelry to celebrate your 10 year anniversary. 
26,"&gt;The death of my partner's father from cancer means she is uncomfortable with my father performing typical father of the bride roles at our wedding - walking me down the aisle and making a speech.    



Hmmm, this is a tough one. On the one hand, her sadness and reluctance on this point is totally understandable. At the same time, it is also YOUR wedding and she is being a *little* selfish here. Her selfishness is somewhat understandable, of course. But it's selfish nonetheless.   


I suppose my view is that it's not reasonable to expect you to exclude YOUR family members from the wedding just because hers can't be involved. I think it will also cause a lot of hurt feelings and resentment for your own father, and if your fiance really loved you she wouldn't expect you to put your relationship with him at risk.   


I would sit her down for a loving but ultimately firm talk and explain this: ""My father is really excited about his role at the wedding and it will hurt him tremendously if he's not allowed to be involved. I completely understand your thoughts on this, but this is also my day and I want my family to be involved. Can you at least try to see this from my point of view and come to a compromise?""    


Or words to that effect. "
27,"""One of them answered ""you should have deleted the group"", and the other said that I should have archived it. They are understandably angry about it,"" your gf shouldn't have looked through your phone in the first place, they not angry about that?. Let her go man she sounds ungrateful and entitled and manipulative. Trust me you don't need it. Stay away from this one."
28,"\&gt;  She believes that people are outside stalking us and other sinister things, when it's just tree branches blowing against the window or something. 

That is pushing into Post Partum Psychosis, OP. You need to phone her doctor IMMEDIATELY and ask what to do.  She is now a danger to herself and your daughter.  

Can you take a leave from work?  Paternal leave?  Sick leave?  Family leave?  Even just some days off to deal with this?  Can you call her mother or a friend who is close to her, and get them to come stay with her during the day?  I am extremely worried for the safety and well-being of your daughter."
29,"You are not being unreasonable. And once you've had time to grieve your loss, please consider if you want to continue a relationship with someone who does not trust you. "
30,"I don't feel you are justified in attacking Tracy at all.  Take a step back for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

In Tracy's life, you are the ex with a kid (who isn't even James's who keeps coming round because James wants to be a good guy. Your relationship with James didn't end because you both stopped caring about each other; rather, it ended because of some obscure reason that doesn't make much sense. You are a stressful presence in their relationship. BUT there is this sweet 4 year old girl who lights up when she sees James, and who really didn't do anything wrong. So, Tracy is trying her best at supporting YOUR DAUGHTER'S happiness, and she is trying her best at supporting James as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So she made some comment about how James is good with your daughter, and how your daughter really seems to care about him? How dare she! You might feel awkward hearing it, but her comments are harmless. She's just trying support the relationship James has with your daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the photographs, she informed you about what happened, and she made it clear she did not give permission. It's far more likely that wires got crossed where James gave permission for the photo regarding the nephew, and the photographer got mixed up and attributed it to your daughter instead. You are looking for a reason to hate Tracy. She isn't trying to play ""house"" with your kid. She's just trying to be a good person in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I think you need to take a step back and ask yourself why you're so keen on hating Tracy? It's time to soul search, because thus far, she's been nothing but good to you."
31,"Be patient with yourself and give it time.  I read once that your first instinct is what you were taught and your second instinct is what really matters.  So, it's a good sign if your first thought when seeing a group of black men is ""scary!"" and your second thought is ""wait, but why did I think that? They look fine.""  You're actively correcting your own bad instincts.  It'll take time before the original instinct goes away (I mean, you've had 18 years of it), but the fact you're aware of it and working to improve is a fantastic step forward."
32,"Get in touch with some of the job offers you had before the move. See if any of them still have a position available for you. It's going to be hard to talk yourself up when you're in this place, but remember that you had a lot to offer them before the move and you still have all that to offer them now. 

Also get in touch with your support system in St. Louis and start talking to them about what's going on. Even talk to his parents, if you are close with them and like them, about how you're not sure that ""you two"" made the right decision.

You're also unfortunately going to have to find a way to have a very real, blunt talk with your husband about what he is willing to do from here. Is he at all willing to leave and move back? Is he willing to do a trial separation while you move back and he keeps working there? Is your only option if you don't want to keep living in Denver to get a divorce?

I agree with the other posters talking about getting in touch with a lawyer for a consult when you can. I'd also suggest looking for a community health centre that might offer free or sliding scale walk in counselling. It can be a big help to have someone neutral to talk to during a time like this. They also may be able to hook you up with resources like maternity clothes and baby supplies.

If he is beginning to understand that he fucked up, you might still be able to convince him that he actually needs to *do* something about his fuck up. He is the one that got your family into this mess so he has the obligation to help you figure out how to get out of it, whether or not that includes him going along with you."
33,"Felt sort of similar about my dad when I was younger. Just felt like things were “off”.  When my parents got divorced I immediately knew I wanted to live with my mom but couldn’t really put my finger on why. A few years later (not to say this is your situation AT ALL) I started to remember the things my dad did to me completely out of the blue. Like I was repressing them or something and I began to see them as completely abnormal behavior. I’m talking sexual abuse, crossing boundaries, putting me in danger, etc. 

Trust your gut, or maybe work things out with a therapist. You feel this way for a reason. "
34,Can you frame it as wanting to buy both of you a new set of rings for your tenth anniversary? Not quite as costly as a cow renewal and I know couples who have done this. 
35,"Fellow lawyer chiming in here - you have to burst her bubble and you have to burst it hard.  This woman has no business being in law school and is exactly the type of person that the for-profit law schools prey on.  

However, there are ways you can soften the blow.  Focus on the fact that the law industry has dramatically changed over the past 10 years and law school is no longer a ticket to a well-paying job.  Talk about how student debt has sky-rocketed, while salaries have plummeted.  Explain to her that if she wants to be a ""trial lawyer,"" that means prosecutor or public defender and maaaaybe insurance defense/personal injury.  Show her the average salaries for these positions and explain how the ""public interest loan forgiveness program"" is turning out to be a myth.  In other words, make the ""problem"" the industry, not her.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend law school to anyone these days unless they are able to get into a T14 school or can go for free or close to it.  "
36,"You have every right to be upset. She ruined something younworked hard on and did so after multiple requests that she not invade your personal save file. She owes you an apology.

Try to give her an analogy to understand. If she had worked for months on a painting, only to come home and find you adding trees and kiteens to this beautiful landscape she spent so much time perfecting, i think shed be really upset. Then she offers you a blank canvas and access to all her paints so uou can make uour own art work but she comes home again and youve now drawn rainbows and unicorns all over her landscape and its unsalvagable from the painting it once was. She would be livid and hurt that you cared so little for her wishes. "
37,"I'm in fact in the ER right now and my wife is safe with an on-call psychiatrist who will be evaluating her. We both spoke to this person, I explained my concerns and now she's interviewing my wife one on one. I should hear soon what the plan will be in terms of if she's held for longer.

I left messages to my wife's PCP and the OBGYN who followed her pregnancy explaining what's happened. Hopefully coming out with it will build a support network of all these people for her so she sees she doesn't have to suffer alone. I'm just hoping she doesn't get spooked or resistant. She did eventually agree to come to the hospital but is quite suspicious and almost panicky. She had a breakdown when I had to leave her for the interview for example."
38,"My dad died two years before my wedding. We were close, so I was still a little heart broken he couldn’t be there.

But he was there. He was mentioned in the officiants speech, he was mentioned in my moms speech and my sisters speech. We played music we would liked (because husband and I love the music too) and had appetizers he would have liked (to be frank, he liked most foods!) 

My mom walked me down the aisle. "
39,"Due to the nature of my job, I have a ring I wear to work and then I have a ring I wear off the clock.

Maybe you could just get a simple ring for professional wear and use the other one when you're home. I know your goal is to get a replacement ring, but sometimes we take a hit to make our SOs happy..."
40,"&gt; I’ve suggested couples therapy often and he has said that he’s not comfortable with it.

I think this was the death knell. The person who cheated doesn't get to deny reasonable requests like this. It's not fair of him to betray your trust and refuse your suggestion for how to rebuild it. Doubly unfair that he then made a jab at you about going through his phone, when he is the one who fucked up.

It sounds like he's sort of checked out and maybe has been since he cheated. I'm sorry, but I think you're right in feeling like this is the end."
41,"Without getting too political, one of my favorite quotes from Barack Obama was ""think about what you want to do, not what you want to be.""
"
42,"You can't go back to your life before you moved because your house is sold, your marriage is a mess, and that life is gone. So you need to figure out what your new life will look like. If you really, really think that St. Louis is where you want to be, you should consult with a lawyer immediately. If you have the child in Denver your husband could possibly block you from moving back after the baby is born because of custody issues. You have a short window to make this decision. If you're not planning to stay in Denver long term, your marriage is in serious trouble, and you have no support system in Colorado, I'm not sure it's wise to have your baby there. 

Put aside the emotional issues for the moment, and focus on the practicalities. You can deal with the emotional issues once you have dealt with the logistical stuff. Call a lawyer right away. Even if you can't afford to retain a lawyer, at least go for a consult. Do some online research yourself to find out what the custody laws are in Denver. Make sure you are informed. Then, figure out where you would live if you move back. Put all the financial stuff down on paper to get it out of your head. Once you have a plan in place, then start dealing with the emotional issues. Those are going to be the hard things and if you focus on them first, you may find yourself in a worse situation by the time you're ready to deal with the logistics. So deal with the practicalities first."
43,"It’s so silly to argue the number. 

I don’t care if it’s 100 or 10 people, being responsible for a high risk population sounds stressful and exhausting. "
44,"Get a lawyer and send a cease and desist order. If she continues, get a restraining order. If she violates that she will be arrested. Every time she sends you something, document it. Have a police officer come over and document it. "
45,"So here's the thing I'm seeing. *He* did not think as a team player when he accepted a job in an expensive city just because it was the first job that said yes; you can do that when you're single and have no ties. *He* then wouldn't rethink the move when a significant life change that affects both of you, but most immediately *you*, occurred. He asked you to ""trust him"", assured you he had a plan (never believe someone has a plan when they won't tell you what it is), and then completely failed - and not because his plans didn't work out...he didn't even give enough of a sh8t to *make* a plan. He's a 36 YO man who thought things would just ""magically"" work out? Now *you* don't trust your own judgement anymore because *he* massively effed up?

If you were my sister, I'd tell you to go home to where you have a support system and have your baby there. Let him lie in the bed he made for a bit and come up with a plan. It's not on you now to suck it up and deal because of ""teamwork*. It's ridiculous to expect you to navigate an entirely new city, while pregnant and trying to find the support resources that you need. He's demonstrated that he's not responsible enough to make big decisions."
46,"Honestly this whole situation is so weird and selfish to me. Trying to stay friends with an ex who acted like your kid’s dad for 3 years and expecting a 4 year old to now understand the difference between ‘daddy ex’ and ‘fun uncle ex’?? Imagine if OP gets through a couple more serious boyfriends, will she also want them to maintain a close relationship with the child if they’ve played daddy? It sounds lovely on paper but as a kid of divorced parents it’s better to just break up and move on with your kid, saves so much heartbreak and stress for the child."
47," It’s only gonna get more awkward and uncomfortable moving foward as your daughter ages, especially when you get a new partner. Best bet is to cut them off and move on. Your daughter is young and will be fine without them in her life.  "
48,"I might get hate for this, but I agree with your husband. It seems he genuinely thought everything through. Have you considered what the second child would feel when you have to give all your time and effort into Ryan’s care? Have you guys thought about couples therapy? "
49,"First off, I'm really proud of you for picking yourself up and blocking them both out of your life. It sounds like you took the healthy steps to recover and have a great support system.

If you have not yet, be very direct and blunt to her via a message off a phone that isn't yours. Or something that she cannot use to further harass you from.

""___ please stop trying to contact me via messages or gifts. I will not accept anything from you. If you continue to harass me I will get the police involved.""

If she ignores that, go to the police and file a harassment claim. This will be a good building block on if you ever need a restraining order from her. Save any evidence you have of her trying to contact you.

I'm sorry this is happening to you OP. You sound like a strong person and you will get through this."
50,"I understand separate finances. Especially if one isnt great with money, but theres no way in hell my wife is going without needed medical attention because she doesnt have the money. What's the point of being married if you cant count on your spouse in times of need. "
51,"That is a very bad sign. At 6 months in, I'd cut your losses if I were you. Not only doesn't she trust you, she's completely irrational and simply kind of dumb."
52,"I know it's a typo, but a cow renewal sounds adorable"
53,"You probably won't want to hear this, but I believe you need to. James is not yours. You don't have rights to him, and neither does YOUR daughter. He has zero responsibility to you or your daughter, nor you to him. As much as you want Tracy to get it through her head that James is NOT the father, you definitely need to be working on that same thing yourself.


You're going on and on about how confusing she or he or they are making it for your daughter, but YOU are doing all of that. YOU are the sole decision maker in your daughter's life. YOU shifted his role from ""daddy"" to ""fun uncle."" YOU wanted to have somebody to care about you in your life so badly, that you've dragged your daughter into this confusing mess.


Since he is not the father, you never should have tried to keep him in that role once the relarelationship ended. He could stay your friend if that's what you guys decided to do, but you should've allowed your daughter to move on - rather than be in this state of confusion.


Did you never think about what would realistically happen when he got into another relationship? Or when you got into one? Did you truly think anyone in those roles would see it as okay or healthy for you to be still trying to play house with this guy? Using your daughter to try and retain some special link with a guy you dated who needs to move on from his ex and her daughter?


YOU HAVE TO DETACH. It's never fun, it's just necessary. So far you've only uncovered the tip of the iceberg as far as how ridiculously badly this whole thing can and will snowball. You've already upset James by accusing him of disrespecting you, you've clearly upset his girlfriend with your message (which of course adds to James' distaste), and your daughter is dealing with you being upset by all of it.


Let him go. Be grateful for what you two had, but realize that it will be disastrous for your daughter, which you're claiming to be worried about. Stop looking for other people to bend their lives around what you'd prefer, and recognize what is. And then stop."
54,"I think this comment is so helpful. I've seen this a lot in the medical field, too - makes sense that law would also have a ton of tertiary positions that are incredibly important but also better-suited to people without the right personality/mindset for being lawyers. Maybe OP can point her towards some of these other career options.

I don't know his SIL so I have no idea if she'd be a good fit for any of these jobs, but it's worth thinking about."
55,"You need to take more drastic action. I suffered from PPD, wanted to kill myself, and knew that I had to kill my baby too so she wouldn’t be without a mother. I never told my husband this!

Don’t wait until she is in agreement. You could go as far as taking her to the emergency room and having her admitted to a psych unit. You need to protect that baby. "

57,"&gt;there've been times that he's said stuff like 'Your jeans are too tight' or 'your legs look good while you're running' or kind of brushed by and touched [my]y body

None of those things are normal.

I went through a phase, when I was about 16, of being terrified my stepdad would make a move on me. He never did, and he never did anything inappropriate either. My fear, however, came from childhood sexual abuse I'd suffered.

Your fear also comes from *somewhere*. Not the same place as mine, of course, but it does come from somewhere. Why did you, as a 10 year old, know your father was a ""sex addict""? And the things he has said to you are really quite inappropriate. I think you might have been exposed to - at the very least - some ideas that you should not have been. 10 year olds shouldn't know much at all about their parent's sex lives, let alone that one of them is a ""sex addict"".

Ultimately, I think you should explore this with a professional, if you can. It does not mean you are crazy. You are a young woman, your fears are not uncommon, and your father, while being 90% a good person, is also 10% *not* a good person, and you are uneasy. That is natural. That is a normal response. You may have some underlying issues around what you heard when you were a child. That's not great for you to deal with, but also not a sign that you are crazy or effed up or something. It's sadly very common for kids and teens to carry some baggage involving their parents as they move into adulthood."
58,"This is lovely advice. 

Also, OP: could you possibly share a photo of the ring? I'm very curious. It might not be that bad. "
59,"If you can get your old job back, go back. 

I would consider the house as sold and done, but if you have a good job and good prospects you can buy a new one. "
60,"Psychiatrist here. Bring her to the emergency room for an immediate psychiatric evaluation. If she refuses you can call the police to have them bring her there based on the fact that she is showing signs of psychosis, which poses a danger to the baby and likely herself. She needs help right now. DO NOT LEAVE THE BABY ALONE WITH HER."
61,This would be a deal breaker for me. What normal 25 year old man is at the same maturity level as a 16 year old? Not to mention just icky. 
62,"I'd swap that talk around a bit.  The focus should be on OP wanting her father involved, with the secondary effects of the fathers feelings being hurt.   The top priority here is the partners in the marriage, all else is secondary.   

"
63,"Sounds like your husband is kind of a moron. 

You had a higher paying job in a city that is dirt cheap, a home and your 6 months along and he just decides to move to an expensive city sight unseen? Yikes.

Hopefully you can get the old job back and find yourself a cheap apartment there. Don’t have any friends that could help ya out? 

I’m from Denver and love it, but it’s a rough city if you don’t make much. I’ll echo the other comments and suggest not having the kid here, or you’ll be trapped into a life you don’t want. "
64,"Your family are all terrible. Your boyfriend is an idiot. Your friends who cut you out--and the one who told everyone--are terrible idiots. You need a whole new social circle.

I would be crushed about how they treated me too. I think you should cut them off. They've all told you something really important about themselves.
"
65,"Please don't marry her until this is sorted out. She needs therapy and medication.  I know you love her OP, but if she refuses treatment you will always be stuck like this. I would walk away if she is refusing to get help and be committed to getting better. "
66,"This is gonna be your cautionary-tale relationship in about 5 years. You’ll bust it out whenever one of your friends starts dating someone with obvious control issues. 

This relationship is going to go down in flames. I think you already know this. You just get to choose whether it’s today’s flames, or future flames."
67,"There is something really wrong in your marriage if your husband is flush with money but is willing to let you struggle to the point of not being able to care for your health.  How are your finances split?  Why is he ok with you being utterly broke?  

His response is just demeaning and gross, to me.  I can't imagine letting my husband live paycheck to paycheck and belittling him for it.  Aren't you two a team??"
68,"Also, let me add: 

•	⁠says he loves you but « not that much »"
69,"I would notify all the people she asked phone numbers for and let it be their choice as far as what they do with that information. She's in the hospital, which is where she needs to be. They aren't idiots, they will see she needs help and will get her into rehab, if she agrees to go.

Beyond that, your mom is on a path. If she wants to get well, she can get well without your involvement. But I totally get why you're not in touch and I think your husband should understand that yes your door is always open to her as long as she gets the help she needs, but she can't make contact with *you* a condition of getting that help. 

I would block any more calls from the hospital. Consider talking to a counselor if guilt is interfering with your ability to maintain the decision that's best for you."
70,"&gt; her parents have asked me to be on the level and my wife thinks I am keeping something. 

No one in her family recognises that she just isn't smart enough to be a lawyer? I think they just want you to be the one to take the fall here."
71,"I'm married.... And I personally have 4 wedding rings. I still have the originals, but I also have a copper-colored silicone one for hiking and camping, tiny thin one(and two backups) for wearing to work at my very hands-centric job, and another, actual copper ring just because it appeals to me. My husband has multiple silicone ones and a copper to match mine, as well as his original which he now considers his ""fancy"" ring. I mean, yes, the ring is a symbol and whatnot, I get that, but in the end, it's just jewelry. My husband and I are so married it probably wafts off of us like a stench, lol. I'm sure you guys are the same way. Approach it with love and honesty and a little bit of bald-faced flattery. ""Honey, you were more mature than me when we picked out these rings and yours is classic and elegant. Now that I've grown up a bit myself I'd like to have a ring that reflects that. I'm so proud to be married to you, but I'd like to be proud of my ring, too."""
72,"That's a low blow. But coming from someone with good oral hygiene and still bad breath, could you tonsil stones? I have them and it sucks, but not hard to manage. :)"
73,Don't react. You're not obligated to get involved in their drama. Her and her family can sort this out themselves.
74,"&gt; I did not want to leave my home and support system while pregnant

So what support system did you have back home if it wasn't family? Friends? Surely some of them would let you stay with them?"

76,"Better yet, ask her to help find one that compliments hers better! "
77,"Postpartum psychosis is, worst case, that horror story stuff where a mom with a newborn to 12ish give or take months year old kills all her kids because ""the devil made"" her do it or some variation thereof. It's quite literally psychosis with an onset during the postpartum period. It can include delusions, hallucinations, and other psychiatric disturbances. There's varying degrees of psychosis. I lapsed into a psychotic episode after having my kid but thank goodness our medical team knew what questions to ask me to get it nipped in the bud before it went full break from reality. Those newborn days are HARD and it can happen to the parents even where there is no history of mental illness. Those newborn-6month old days especially are really, really hard. "
78,"Delay the wedding. She's not ready. Anyone who asks for a free pass 2 months before a wedding, isn't ready to be married. This is a possible dealbreaker. You need to find out WTF she was thinking. "
79,"Op it’s time for you to do what you knew you should’ve done in the first place: look out for your mental health and this baby that’s on the way. If you have family you can stay with, move back home. Clothes and other items can be replaced. You don’t need to be living in a bad neighborhood while expecting a child just so your husband can play breadwinner. He lied, he was so negligent in urging you to move, and quite frankly he was jealous and prideful. He pushed you to drop your good career opportunities all for the purpose of chasing after his own. His market worth is obviously just as shitty in the new location as it was the old. 

Pack your shit and head home to start working on your mental health and rebuilding for this baby. He can either get a grip and follow you and his child, or he can sink by himself. Now is the time to be selfish considering that he didn’t even have enough decency to be honest about the situation with his pregnant wife. "
80,"&gt; I messaged Tracy later on making it clear that I didn’t want my daughter to be used in any kind of situation where the facts weren’t clear, and no, James was not her father. I didn’t get a reply. 

The problem is that, regardless of genetic and legal reality, you have James filling the role of father in your daughters life Complete with visitation/parenting time post split. So, no, James not being the father isn't being made very clear at all.

&amp;#x200B;"
81,"Do not give her the satisfaction the “explain her side of the story” she did something horrible to you. You do not let her in. You have a wonderful family and group of friends, you don’t need someone like that in your life."
82,Just send her some screen shots. You might save her a disease. 
83,"If you really want her to stop harassing you (which is what she's doing) I would send her a **Cease and Desist.**  You can ask a lawyer to send one, but it's not a legally binding document.  However it's a good way to get started on obtaining a restraining order by documenting your attempts to get her to stop communicating.  

Just because you're both female and she's doing it out of guilt doesn't mean you have to keep enduring this unwanted harassment. "
84,"I used to date a girl whose morning breath smelled fruity to me. Something sweet, like berries.


I've been told it's related to genetic compatibilities as well. I'd love to understand more about the phenomenon, though. 


Our kids would've been *superhumans.*"
85,"I would say, even with talking to the nurses, try to actively go to her appt with her and explain your concerns to the physician as well, giving examples. I've seen nurses get confused/lose the message occasionally. Being there with her (if she doesn't oppose you going in) will assure that you don't leave without a plan."
86,"&gt;  I have found my person.

Sorry, but no. You have been dating this person for **7 months**. You literally barely know him. You're still in the ""honeymoon"" phase of the relationship, which is why after only 7 months of dating, you're willing to tank your career and marry him. No, no, no. "
87,No absolutely not. Just tell him that you don’t feel comfortable with his request because of how soon it is in the relationship and he should respect it. You guys have only been dating for 2 months. 
88,"Honestly she’s a manipulative person and a control freak. Why on earth would you WANT to be with someone like this?? Seriously the more I read it the more I thought , “ she must be a real firecracker in the bedroom for him to put up with all this bullshit”, but seriously it’s not worth it. 

She’s placed so little value in you that she breaks up with you when you don’t give her what she wants. It’s all about HER never anyone else. I suggest you be happy she’s gone and stay away "
89,"If he doesn’t want to relocate then let him be.

You are young, you can find someone else. Or maybe in the future you guys can give it another shot. But seriously, you need to focus on you. No one will ever provide anything to you besides yourself. Yeah relationships are great and he may provide you some things, but at the end of the day you are the person who makes your own destiny and your happiness. 

You need you take risks and live your life. If everyone is being supportive and you decide not to go because of some guy you’ve only been dating for 7 months, who you clearly even said you don’t even know if you’ll be together forever is not a good sign.

Just go. Build your career. Keep in contact if you want to. But don’t ever stop yourself from achieving your goals because of someone. That’s rule number one of life. It’s like taking a step back. Don’t do that to yourself, because if you guys breakup you’re going to be so mad at yourself for not going. 

So leave in good terms and in the future you can reach out again. 

Good luck! "
90,"Yikes. First I just want to say I'm sorry. What a shitty position to be put in. She needs to be pulling her weight.

Let her know that either she gets her depression treated and gets into another job or you're going to have to get out of the place you're in. Do not bend over backwards trying to afford all of this. It's not worth it. This should be a sign that you might not want to take this relationship further if this is what you're in store for."
91,"If he doesn't like the way you look now, whst will he think when you're old and wrinkly?

You have put your foot down more than once and he has still chosen to be an ass. I would find someone who isn't embarassed by your existence. "
92,"a less accusatory way of asking directly if he’s checking out younger girls would be to say “oh, do you know her?” to make it seem like you don’t think he’s a creep. if you’re able to do this more than once it’ll definitely lay the groundwork for you to open a conversation about it without jumping to conclusions or being overly accusatory, and could keep you safe if the situation gets inflammatory. "
93,"You came here asking how to help your boyfriend understand your struggle with your job and have more compassion for you. Does he honestly understand what you do?

You have an *extraordinarily* stressful job.  In addition to the entirely inadequate funding for health care, the funding for staff and administration is so small it nearly guarantees failure.  

One of the greatest stressors you face is the fact that many officers and staff are deeply cynical and don't believe prisoners deserve care for their physical ailments, and certainly not for their mental or psychological conditions.  Every day, you deal with non-medical people in authority telling you the men are fakers, stupid, crazy, lying, or *deserve to suffer.* 

Your supervisors overrule your recommendations by saying it costs too much. You never have enough time, money, or staff to provide even barebones basic care.  Every day you are forced to make choices on *who will not receive care.*

Your job is like working triage all day, every day, with no end in sight.  The environment itself creates new patients.  

It is *impossible* to do this job well, because you aren't given the staff, supplies, or budget you need.

If I'm wrong about that, then please ignore me and quit reading.

 &gt;He wanted me to tell my director that I can’t do these things because they’re hard to deal with. I’ve said that’s not an option but he doesn’t get it.

He's flippantly offering you a throwaway solution when what you want is for him to *listen*.

You'd like your bf to have some appreciation for the very difficult work you do and show you some compassion and understanding.

At a time when you are not stressed, *tell him exactly that.*

You aren't asking for a solution --there isn't one.  You aren't asking for advice.  You're asking him to listen.

Look.  I back up your claim that your job is far more difficult and stressful than his appears to be.  I back that up 1000%.  But you don't really need him to agree with your take on who has the harder job.  

You want him to listen quietly when you've had an extra bad day. That's not asking too much, but you will need to ask for it.  It would be great to have a partner who sensed, ""She seems upset and distressed and maybe I should fix a cup of tea for us and sit down with her,"" but that's not happening yet.

You should also consider counseling for yourself to help you manage the endless frustration of not having the resources to do your job effectively.


"
94,"&gt;my SIL keeps asking me to be frank with her; her parents have asked me to be on the level and my wife thinks I am keeping something. 

Ask your wife to read this post.  It explains your opinion clearly.  Don't let your wife continue to believe you are hiding anything.  Tell her you are uncomfortable being frank about her sister's chances at success because it is putting you on the spot.  Nobody wants to be the person who stomps on someone's dream.

&gt;She called me and asked what was wrong and to help her evaluate her applications. Her letters were pretty much garbage, her accompanying documents were pointless and she lacked even a basic coherence. Her LSAT scores are way below competitive even for the bottom tier of schools and her GPA is probably a solid C.

What did you say to your SIL when she asked you why all her applications were rejected?  Didn't she realize the rejections were a legitimate indicator that she did not possess what it takes to be accepted and succeed?

&gt;My in-laws and family want me to give them a frank talk and I am at a place where I don't know what to do.

Hmm.  This looks like her parents *know* she's not suited, but don't want to be the bad guys who tell her.  Rather than have a family gathering where you are tasked with being the messenger, maybe you and your wife could have her over to your home for lunch and speak quietly to her.  

Have some suggestions about where to go from here, like getting some career counseling.  Or training for a trade.
"
95,Reading this exhausted me.  Let her go and consider yourself lucky. 
96,"Your husband is already working 70+ hours a week, and you seriously think you guys can handle having another child?! Sorry, but he's right. You guys are barely making this work as is both time-wise and money-wise. 

And all of his points about what that other child's life could be like are absolutely true. That kid'll never get to have a normal vacation. That kid will never have their parents' full attention. That kid will always be a burden on an already overtaxed family. Is that the kind of life you want for your children? One where they never get to see their dad bc he's working multiple full-time jobs just to make ends meet, where their brother needs to bulk of the family's resources and their needs are necessarily second-place?

Also, you don't ""deserve"" another child. It's a child, not a participation ribbon."
97,"Based on the type of people who make prank videos, you're probably dating a jerk. "
98,"&gt; Every time I try to talk about it I feel like it turns into me being the bad guy. 

come on now mate, if you cant have serious discussions about this (or in general), you arent ready to get married. plain and simple.

&gt; Also I don’t know how I would call off the wedding. I’m scared she would hurt herself or die from sadness or something.

Do not, i repeat NOT, get married for this reason."
99,"Thank god for people like you who don't stand by and allow child abuse when you see(or hear) it. If you hear it again maybe even record it for the cops and CPS, those poor kids are in an abusive household and those parents need to be taken to task for it. "
100,You need a councilor to handle this. She should be in grief counciling any way. My father inlaw died last feb from cancer. It took a long time to convince my husband to attend counciling afterwards but it made a world if difference. I really think a professional mediator is your best option. 
101,"Talk it out with her, but make sure you don't use words like ""professional"" because that word just sounds cold and passionless. Explain to her that you've grown up a lot and you want a new ring to symbolize your growth and maturity as an individual and together as a couple. Maybe you could frame it as a 10th-anniversary thing (which is already one hell of an achievement, especially getting married so young) so she can have a genuine, sentimental attachment to it. It's cheaper than a vow renewal and just as sentimental/romantic."
102,"I didn’t know I was suffering from PPP until much later when I received help for PPD. I would see shadows walk by, I was convinced my son was a zombie who wanted to eat my brain every time I heard him rooting. I often considered throwing myself off the balcony. It was a terrible time and I finally understood how some mothers are capable of harming their children. It is a terrifying place to be in."
103,"Why would a 10 year old know that her father is a sex addict? It's totally possible that you accidentally overheard something you shouldn't have, but this doesn't sit right with me without more context (especially when paired with the inappropriate comments and touching from him). You should definitely talk to a therapist if you can."
104,"""I'll wait while you collect yourself and then you can address this concern.""

Just sit there, let her go sob, vomit, dry heave or whatever. It can't last forever. Then force her to address the issue.

Do not comfort her. Don't give her any positive feedback that would reinforce the behavior. "
105,"This. Go back to St Louis and stay with a friend or something so you can regroup. Your husband was incredibly selfish in talking you into moving to Denver without having any solid plan just because his parents wanted him to have a ""grown up"" job. "
106,"I think your husband is right, don’t ruin what you have at the moment for something you may have in the future. And with him working 70 hours a week, and you looking after your son already, is it actually feasible to have a baby? I wish you all the best of luck whatever happens, but I think he is being smart on this one."
107,Just move on. You already have no reason to trust him only 6 months into the relationship. 
108,"The guy was sweaty and half naked when you walked in on him with another woman naked in his bed. Do you really think that's""not what it seems like""?

The drugs and nightmare wouldn't even explain why he had a woman in his bed anyways. Don't be a fool and stay with him OP."
109,"My brother was born with severe special needs. He is autistic, non verbal, highly violent. In school he picked up the habits of other special needs children.

I was the first born child. Growing up I was severely neglected due to my parents always having to give 90 percent of their care to my sibling. I often wished for a normal life and childhood. We were 8 years apart on age and I grew to resent him.

My brother got worse and worse as he aged and he is now placed in a full time care facility.

My parents and I have a strained relationship because they tried to force his care onto me. Unfortunately for them I refuse to take on the burden after they pass. 

My childhood left me with many mental health realted issues. I was afraid about having children of my own for years.

My parents only found out about my brothers condition when it was too late. They wanted a larger family, but opted to stop after him because it was too hard.

Only now after 20 years they have a life again where they can function normally and go out on dates.

I'm not saying its wrong to want another child, but it is wrong to try and force your wishes on your husband. Coming from the other side of things, I completely agree with your husband."
110,"You 100% did the right thing. This is why kids grow up so fucked up in the world. Because of toxic environments just like that. I’d recommend once your lease is over, to re locate just so you don’t have to have that constant fear in your mind. You did the right thing and I would of did the same. "
111,"&gt;, there've been times that he's said stuff like 'Your jeans are too tight' or 'your legs look good while you're running' or kind of brushed by and touched by body,

Yeah, those would do it. 

You're creeped out because your dad has done creepy things."
112,"I'm the type of person who cries very easily when I'm having an argument with someone I care for. I really hate it and try to hide my face/tears. It makes me flustered and it becomes a vicious cycle. Strangely, I have a hard time crying in some situations where it would actually be appropriate.

What your gf is doing is way beyond being a crier. She won't let you look away from her? That's controlling. Pouting and stomping around is a childish attempt at manipulation. It sounds, from your description, like she is doing this or using this to get you to drop subjects she doesn't want to discuss and to get the results she's going for. It's really troubling. She needs to be willing to work on this in order to have a healthy relationship, because these hard conversations are not going to stop coming up as life goes on. If she's not willing to acknowledge that her behavior is unfair and unhealthy, you need to reevaluate whether you should be with her. 

Basically, don't give in to her emotional terrorism. Sit her down and tell her that not being able to have serious and unfun conversations with her is a real problem and things can't go on this way. You can't be a team like this. Don't let her force you to drop the issue. If she won't listen, that's all you need to know. "
113,"&gt;Since I've been at home 24/7 applying to jobs, I've been spending a LOT of time with the dog. I feed him, walk him, let him outside, play with him in the yard and with toys, and he lays on my lap all day long.

Her dog is more attached to you now because you're spending the most time with it, giving it attention, love, feeding him, etc. He sees you as his person. If she wants her dog to stay attached to her, then she needs to be spending more time with him, rather than ignoring his basic needs (I'm assuming she is considering you're the one doing all the caregiving) and spending all this time away from home and from him.

Also, FYI, dogs sitting at their owners' feet while they use the bathroom is actually very common! They just like being near their people at all times. It's not unhealthy at all. :)"
114,"Wait, why exactly would he be a single father?

Honestly this comment is exactly why you need to go take the job. Getting married at 22 to a guy you've known for less than a year is *bonkers* and you're lucky he's not taking advantage of your immaturity there. Go take your dream job and grow some more as a person, you may never get this opportunity again."
115,"You should get some surgery, yes.

Have *him* removed."
116,As unfortunate as the circumstances are for your finance it's completely unfair to you and your father to stop him from participating in the wedding. I think you could talk to her about this in a loving way that'll make her understand.
117,Just give her the £35 but say you want the bra.
118,"You did not cheat and someone helped you out of a bad situation with your anxiety. That dude gets it because maybe he has it too and knew what to do. The BF on the other hand doesn't get it and is playing on that to be an ass and keep you under his thumb. People get crushes on others it happens but acting on it is different. 

Do yourself a favor and do some mental roleplay. Imagine your best female friend is sitting on your bed ranting about her boyfriend and how he always makes her feel bad. How she did something innocent but brings it up and keeps making it worse everytime. Annoys the crap out of her until she is like ya fuck it let's take a break because she is emotionally done but still ""loves"" him and takes him back after he's manipulated the situation to him. Imagine the bf saying she ruined a happy place because she had an emotional breakdown and someone stuck by her through and after it? What do you tell your friend? Say stick it out because it is love or do you say leave him because you see the emotional abuse that she is receiving?"
119,11 hours? Two months?? Heeeelllllllll no. Look up all the legal and financial ramifications for letting a virtual stranger have full reign over your vehicle. 
120,"Your wife was upset, and you expressed that calmly. People are allowed to feel their feelings, and he clearly knew that this would hurt her. Are he and his wife sort of petty and competitive?"
121,"I’d be done, personally. 

Aside from the ethical issues, I’d have trouble *ever* trusting the judgement of an adult who found out their crush was *sixteen* and didn’t IMMEDIATELY back away. And he planned to propose to her?! That’s not a person who has any sort of decent decision-making skills or foresight. What a stupid, stupid series of choices. 

Throw this one back in the pond, OP. "
122,"She's a fruit cake.  Go home.   She's denying her actions and accusing you of being a lying, disloyal, cheater with no moral compass.  Do you really want to be with someone who twists the truth and accuses you of being dirt "
123,"I think the way you phrased it here in your post is really great. I'm so happy that a couple of 19 year olds getting married didn't end badly. I love that you cringe now to think of the person you were, but love to think of how great she was. 

If you get a simple gold wedding band, it wouldn't be to get rid of the old one. You'll always have it. 

OP's wife, how great that he is here talking you up, and worried about hurting you. Please let him let go of this 19 year old fashion choice. Imagine if we all had to walk around the world with the accessories we picked out at 19."
124,"&gt; He will come home from work and drop all of his belongings in random places, throw his clothes all over the floor, and generally just create a mess. 

Yeah, my five-year-old does that too, and it's pretty annoying. What I do is take her hand, lead her back to the mess, and watch while she picks her things up and puts them away like a big girl.

As for your grown-ass boyfriend, I think you should dump him and find someone who respects your time and doesn't treat you like his personal servant. You are literally doing *everything* in addition to providing half the financials! This is some serious bullshit. "
125,"I really like this analogy, cool. She actually makes bags etc outta silk as a hobby (and sometimes sells them) so I could work that into a mirroring analogy. "
126,"You aren't the one ruining things.  She is.

Tell her husband.  Also tell him that he's in an abusive relationship and needs to get out now.

I gotta be honest here.  Why are you friends with such an awful, toxic, person?"
127,"If she is still determined after being told the hard truth, then my next advice would be to tell her to apply as a paralegal or even start in mail/reception areas of a law firm. That way she can get an inside look. "
128,I’d want to know. It’s a pretty shameful lie and you may be saving her a lot of grief or even saving her health. 
129,I have a feeling that your wife is just as entitled as her family... You better tell her what you're feeling right now or you're going to be taking the place of the uncle in the future. 
130,"&gt;&gt; But my current gf is upset, saying that I'm choosing my ex to be there and comfort me instead of her. I don't want her there because she never really cared for my dog.

You're doing what's best for your dog, which is to have two beloved humans who love him with him in his last moments. Your gf is making your stress and grief about her, which is very unattractive. When someone is bereaved, you give them space to handle it how they see fit without being a jerk about it, which your gf is being. ""GF, I'm sorry you feel that way, but this is about me and my dog, not about you and your feelings, and I've handled it the way I see fit. If you want to make this an issue of trust, I'm afraid I can't help you. """
131,My prediction is that this kind of irrational and provocative behaviour will grow more and more common if you continue to see her. 
132,"She needs to start seeing a therapist. The therapist can help her to address her fears about medication and can be the primary place for her to let out all of those overwhelming depressive feelings. She needs to understand that OP can be there for her and can support her through this by holding her and providing comfort but he can’t be her therapist. He can’t fix this and it is wrong of her to expect him to. He isn’t a professional and she needs professional help. Even if she ultimately won’t get on board with medication, she needs to transfer the primary burden for helping her through her depression to a therapist. "
133,"&gt;&gt;They are understandably angry about it, since she was not going to get a surprise party because of my little mistake.

She didn't want the surprise party in the first place, so all's well that ends well?"
134,"I’m reaching here, but don’t put yourself in a position where she gets pregnant with you. "
135,"EVERYONE IS MISSING THIS! She can't be in a locked room for fucking 15 seconds without opening it, going into a messenger app, and looking through conversations. JESUS FUCK! And she's a huge controlling bitch what the fuck would you ever feel sorry for???"
136,"Issue #1. He refused to pay for medical care **for his wife** despite being able to easily afford it.

Issue #2. He's loving the income disparity and enjoys slagging you off to his friends.

Issue #2.5. He's a jackass."
137,Ignore him. He made his bed. 
138,"I am not a believer in having a conversation about these kinds of thinvs. He will just hide it better and you will just think you were imagining it and move on while the problem keeps existing.

Don't talk to him about this. Trust yourself! Trust what you saw, don't give him a chance to explain it away and hide it. Quietly observd him a few more times and if you keep seeing it, move on.

There is absolutely no upside in having a conversation about this. I don't know what the people advising you to do that are coming from? What is the purpose of such a conversation?"
139,"OP, I am going to be real with you. She is, intentionally or not, manipulating you with her mental health, tears, and subsequent break downs. 

You cannot set yourself on fire to keep your fiance warm. 

Here is how it is: 

She is depressed. Her depression is affecting your quality of life to the point where it is having severe negative impacts. 

Instead of acknowledging the problem, she cries and you back down and nothing gets fixed. Rinse and repeat. 

You can not keep going on like this. She is holding you hostage to an engagement and a marriage with her life. Intentional or not, that is emotionally abusive, and you need to wake up and see this for what it is.

She is a grown adult. She can get help for her problem, or she can accept how it is right now as the new norm forevermore. What she CAN'T do is ask you to place your life on hold and if not, she'll break down and/or kill herself. 

If I came to you and said my childhood friend told me I had to marry him or he would kill himself, would you tell me to marry him? I bet not. But you're convincing yourself to do the same for your fiance because of your history and her mental health. Wake up. 

You need to grow a spine. You are not doing this to hurt her. You are trying to save yourself. She can get help, or she can leave you alone. What you have right now is not sustainable or healthy. 

You came here for advice. People are giving it to you and all you're saying is ""I CAN'T..!!!"" Do you want help or not? You've found out through personal experience that you can't reason with her without her breaking down. Let her break down. If she is going to hurt herself, you need to call 911. If she cant talk through things with her fiance without wanting to kill herself, she is in no place to get married.

Asking her to help herself to the point where she's not keeping you hostage in your own home is not mean. Her using her breakdown as a way to get you to give into the status quo is mean. 

You don't have to be mean, but you do have to stick to your convictions. You can't keep doing this to yourself. She is drowning and instead of using a floating device she is pulling you down too. 

"
140,"You know the weird thing about your post?  One sentence:

\&gt;  I have these instances of certainty and I think that ""Yes, yes, she is right for me."" I feel overjoyed.  

That's a feeling.  It is very odd to have those kinds of feelings without feeling some kind of connection and affection for her.  What I would do if I were you is give yourself another month, but get yourself into some therapy sessions.  Let a professional poke around a bit and see if this is an issue with you, or an issue with her.  You don't want to end something good only to find out years later that it was because you hadn't worked through XYZ."
141,I agree. She says that she deserves to have another child and Ryan deserves to have a sibling... but what about what another child would deserve? And what about what her husband deserves and wants?

143,"We took the Strong Interest Inventory in grad school. One of my classmates scored very high for “bus driver” and was devastated, since we were working on our Masters in counseling. Our professor asked her if she liked working in a very structured environment, with a predictable schedule, a sense of distanced leadership, precise interactions, etc. She said yes to all of them. Therefore, she *could* drive a bus if she wanted to. It was all about what you like/enjoy/prefer that can translate into all kinds of different professions.
"
144,"My money would be on the fact that a boundary has already been crossed with this boss/other prospect. Maybe not full physical, but this is a cover story so that if anything came out later, ""You gave me a free pass"". 

And unless you guys have a history of sharing cuckolding fantasies with each other, she's back-peddling this into a ""fantasy"" because she immediately realized her dick move.

A grown up doesn't do this 2 months before the wedding. 

Try to stop imagining what might have happened, you'll only make yourself crazy. Do you have a friend you could stay the night with? Maybe check into a hotel and get some space. Then think about what your next steps are...at the very least, you guys need to have a very frank and open dialog about the relationship."
145,"Lawyer, lawyer, lawyer.   
Not just r/legaladvice but an actual lawyer. You need someone to handle your custody set up and child support payments (this order can include how you two communicate with each other). You can also speak to that lawyer about the girlfriend's actions, and if it is not in their wheelhouse as a family lawyer, they should be able to direct you towards a criminal lawyer. "
146,"The annoyance ar Tracy mentioning that James loves playing with the daughter really got me.  Like wtf else is Tracy supposed to talk about??  They don't know each other but they have James and the daughter in common...so that's what shes going to bring up in small talk.

The picture thing definitely sounds like wires got crossed.  Tracy even made a point to say that they made sure the pics of the daughter were not posted online--seems unlikely that she would okay just one of them??

Idk if OP still has feelings for James or what but her annoyance with Tracy seems completely unfair."
147,"&gt;I’ve tried to bring it up to him several times, but he won’t answer me. He actually sits there in silence whenever I try to talk to him about it.

It's not trivial, your boyfriend is an asshole.  "
148,"I'm just so happy you took quick action and it sounds like you are doing everything right! Your daughter and wife are lucky to have you.

150,"It's up to you if that's a deal breaker. It certainly can be.

For me, it would seriously undermine my trust is any adult man that he had chosen to date a teenager in his mid-twenties. Especially if, even in hindsight, he doesn't see a problem with it. This isn't about how mature she was or wasn't. She could be the most mature, wonderful person on the planet. She was still 17. So this is about how immature he needed to be to find that relationship appropriate. "
151,"My dad is in no place to be looking after a baby or taking on anyone else's mental loads including mine. He's been very depressed since my mom died (completely understandable) however he has been refusing my recommendations to seek support groups or grief therapy. A couple months ago he went on a binge of not only drinking but drugs he's never to my knowledge done before. I know he tried at least coke and acid. During this he was sending almost incomprehensible texts about how he was finally understanding the meaning of everything. Eventually he came down and that's when the fixation on becoming a woman started. He's lost touch with all his old friends, got a new group of very ""hipster"" I guess people in their 20s/30s and they're all active in the queer community, psychedelic drugs, and all this stuff my dad had never once displayed a sign of interest in prior to dealing with my mom's death.

This is honestly a whole other post and really not relevant to my foremost problem right now."
152,"^ he is checked out, if not also cheating again. Your real relationship died when he cheated the first time, but you were fortunate to have him there during your recovery for some support—I’m sure it made things easier.

My hunch is that he felt guilty, tried to appease his conscience by helping you through this in your time of need, and has now cashed in on the guilt rebate and spent his earnings without you. 

The whole “you’re just gonna look through it anyway” line is a completely uncalled for, passive-aggressive projection of trust issues that he has literally no reason to place on you. One must then ask: what is going on in his mind to cause such neurotic behavior around the thought of your invading his privacy? To me it sounds like he was trying to make you feel bad for thinking he could be cheating again, thus deterring you from wanting to press the issue of you did.

Leave this child."
153,"That would piss me off and I don't even play video games.  You asked her twice not to play your existing game and she did it anyway, because, what, she knows better than you?  Is this the first time she's done something like this?  Can you password lock her out of your character?"

159,"If you are not comfortable with it, that's all the 'excuse' you need. Why can't he take his car? If he wasn't prepared to provide his own transportation for an 11 hour trip, he shouldn't have planned it. He's not on your insurance - good reason #1. You don't want 100s of miles put on your car - good reason #2. What if you have a emergency and are stranded without transportation - good reason #3. You simply don't want to - great reason #4. Don't be pushed into doing something you don't want to do, simply because he does want you to do it. "

162,"It's clear that your girlfriend was disrespectful and unsupportive, but I'm not sure she was wholly responsible for your night being screwed. When you saw she wasn't up for it, why didn't you send her home? I'm thinking the fact that you were constantly babysitting her and keeping her around when she didn't want to be there made you look worse--unprofessional, honestly--than if you'd been on your own or if she'd left early with whatever excuse you could give. Yes, being there on your own would have been awkward, and it would have been great if your girlfriend had been up to what you wanted her to do. But if it's YOUR profession and your work event, at the end of the day it's your job to advocate for yourself, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying this as someone who has lived and worked in the Los Angeles area, and been to promotional/industry events--maybe not as high-profile as yours, but sometimes you just have to paste your fake smile on, own the fact that you're there without someone on your arm, and make the best of it. It's not the worst thing in the world."

164,"It shouldn't be about who's job is harder or more stressful. You're each entitled to feel the unique stresses of your lives and your jobs. But what's not ok is your partner dismissing you and your stress about your job.

My wife's job is objectively harder and more stressful than mine. She deals with data for marketing of a very large company so she's constantly being pulled in a million directions with pretty high stakes.  She loves the company and would never quit but it gets to her. I listen to her vent and I support her. My job is really simple, but it's mind numbingly boring, my company is poorly run and doesn't treat its employees well, and I'm constantly micromanaged. She is supportive when I vent.

That's the whole point of the relationship. You're supposed to be there for eachother when the other person is struggling, no matter how trivial or how it compares to the other. It sounds like your bf isn't doing a good job of that. You need to calmly convey to him that you're hurt when he dismisses you when you're upset. Don't bring ""my job is harder"" into it, because then it just becomes an argument that doesn't help anyone. "
165,"""I feel frustrated when you use examples from your own work to advise me on how to cope with the stresses of my job. Our jobs are different, with completely different responsibilities, stresses, and solutions. One of the things that is challenging about my job is how I feel isolated in my level of responsibility, and when you offer advice that would work for your job, I feel more isolated because it's not relevant and not relatable. Really what I want is to be heard. Sometimes my day is tough, and there is no solution that you can offer me. However, I believe as my partner you could offer me support. What I need to feel supported is for you to actively listen, and then [hug me, cook a meal for me, take me on a date, tell me nice things, surprise me with a little gift (&lt;-- you should figure out your love language).

171,You’re doing the right thing OP. I truly hope your wife gets the help that she needs 
172,My experience with my dad was very similar. My first thought about ops post was repressed memories
173,"&gt; He admitted he didn’t even listen to what I had to say about not moving. He wanted this job and he wanted me out here with him. He did no research and he didn’t even scope out our rental or neighborhood it is in. He figured it would all “just work out”. I don’t know what to do. At this point I just want to go back to St. Louis. I can still kill the sale but it will mean he’ll get sued for thousands by both the real estate agent and the perspective buyers. Going home also means I’ll only have what I can fit in my car. It will be just me, my clothes and a few household items. I will be completely broke in an empty house sleeping on the floor. I just can’t be here anymore. I’m not okay. 

Seriously. Fuck him. Go home, get ready for a divorce and starting over. He made the decision to fuck you over in his best interest and he still has no care for your mental health or ability to provide for the child. 

Being a single mom with job opportunities has got to be better than staying with an idiot who didn’t even take what you had to say into consideration, and is ruining your mental health and financial independence for the sake of his pride. "
174,"I think there are two levels of stuff here that need to be addressed separately. 

1. You wanted your girlfriend to fulfill her social obligation as your girlfriend at your work event. I feel like this is a normal &amp; reasonable expectation. You wanted her to stand with you, engage in small talk, take a photo of you with other people, etc. 

2. You wanted your girlfriend to work as your promoter by striking up conversations about your work so you wouldn’t look like you were self-promoting. This is a different &amp; bigger ask, &amp; depending on your girlfriend’s personality, I can see why she wouldn’t feel comfortable acting in this capacity or would be afraid it would come off as fake instead of genuine. 

I think you need to focus on point one, which is a basic relationship expectation. It’s totally fair to expect your partner to participate in your life events instead of sitting in a corner sulking because she’s bored &amp; not the center of your attention. If your girlfriend can’t meet that baseline of expectation, then you need to re-evaluate what you’re getting from this relationship that you’re investing so much into. But I think you should keep in mind that the hype stuff will take a special kind of person. I know I wouldn’t be comfortable approaching groups of strangers to be like, “Ooh, have you met my boyfriend? He’s the photographer. Come meet him!” I would feel stilted &amp; fake &amp; uncomfortable. Not everyone will be able to do that for you. "

184,"Well, you can start by pouring it out to her like you just put in this post.

I'd recommend postponing your wedding until this gets figured out.

Tell her all the things you told us about wanting her to be happy but not being able to face a lifetime of negativity.  Honestly, when you talk to her about it, it needs to be less about you helping her fix it (I get it, we like to fix things, I'm the same way) and more about how you feel and how you are affected by her change.  Not saying you can't be supportive, but it does sound like you let the discussions with her become one-sided in her favor and don't bring up your true feelings on the matter.  I have a feeling you're getting frustrated because you're focused on helping her but you aren't letting her have the full picture of how it affects you.

Ultimately, you can lead a fiancee to water, but you can't make her drink.  I hate suggesting it, but maybe you need couple's counseling.  She has to want to get better though, and if she's incapable of working through it herself, together with you, and with professional medical help/attention to get to a better state of mental health, then you should not marry her."
185,"In order to preserve the no contact on your part, you should consider paying for a lawyer to send her a C&amp;D. 

You should also consider contacting the company that sends you the flowers monthly, and telling them that a stalker is using their services to harass you. They can stop sending you the flowers and refund her card. Maybe even do something in their system to prevent her from starting again. You don’t need the monthly reminder of her betrayal. Anything else she sends, write “refused, return to sender” if they’re one-offs. There’s a chance that once she gets enough mail back, and purchases returned and refunded, she’ll stop harassing you that way. "
186,"Tonsil stones and also unhealthy bacteria in your stomach can cause bad breath. You can check for tonsil stones by having a friend look at the back of your throat with a flashlight. As for stomach bacteria, probiotics can help. I would recommend seeing a doctor and having proper checks done.

This is so bad and confusing for your daughter, how can you even think of leaving her alone with him? The girlfriend is not even the problem. You are. Why are you doing this? This is going to get so much worse, when your daughter gets older. Do not let anyone play dad to her, this will be the second man abandoning her in her young life (do not even think James will stick around forever, he won't). Stop this. It is you and your daughter, she comes first and there is no baby daddy. Teach her that this is okay and stop looking for surrogate fathers. That is really not fair."
188,"If she’s not in a place where she can be supportive of you experiencing the normal joys of getting married, I’d postpone the wedding.

189,I think your “friend” did you a favor by outing what kind of person she is and where everyone’s loyalty lies with you. That is personal and private regardless of what appointment that was. Didn’t realize you had to inform the whole world you were going in to treat a UTI...ridiculous. That’s not a friend. If she was she would know what kind of person you are and would talk to you about it first before broadcasting it to everyone. I’m sorry I’m sure your views changed on the people around you but replace those you can and work on the relationship with your parents and explain to them how they have broken YOUR trust and hurt you making assumptions based on a rumor from someone who also made an assumption.

What you're dealing with here is a classic example of being in the honeymoon fase of a new relationship with rose coloured glasses on. It will eventually wear off and you will KICK yourself for being so short sighted, if you stay. 

Go do the interviews, find an amazing job, you'll find your person eventually, too. 

"
205,"So she asked you this a week after your brother passed away? 

I’m very sorry about what you’re going through. I think it is heartless to put something like that in your head anytime, let alone when you’re dealing with such grief. I’m gobsmacked to be honest. Everyone deserves better than that. It may have just been a very, very dumb and selfish move on her part, but I know I would need some serious time to re evaluate if I was you. Take the time you need and focus on your family now. Best of luck.

"
206,No family on my side. I was adopted and tossed out at 17. Maybe I can just stay there until the sale closes and then find a rental. 
207,"100% agree, it should be about ""I want my father there and it's important to me"", not ""but my father's feelings would be hurt!"" Focusing on his feelings will lead to a ""his feelings are more important than mine to my future wife"" feeling."
208,"&gt; Why did you, as a 10 year old, know your father was a ""sex addict""? And the things he has said to you are really quite inappropriate. I think you might have been exposed to - at the very least - some ideas that you should not have been. 10 year olds shouldn't know much at all about their parent's sex lives, let alone that one of them is a ""sex addict"".

Agreed. Whether he's being inappropriate or not, learning that your dad is a sex addict at 10 years old is... not only really odd, but probably going to have some lasting effect on how you perceive him and what he says/does."
209,"...Fuckin' what? You're joking right? Please tell me you're joking. I remember in HS how big of a difference in maturity there was between the 16 year olds I knew and the \*18\* year olds, a small amount of time at that age makes a huge difference, let alone 9 GODDAMN YEARS. I dated a 25 year old at 19 and even then we were in such vastly different places in our lives, y'know, as one should be. I felt weird as hell at 18 when my friends brought a 14 year old over to kick it. 25 and 16 is a huge gap, it implies some real fucked up shit about the 25 year old."
210,Your ex girlfriend just did you a favour by leaving you.
211,"Don't be scared, because if he comes back at you with, ""UGH you're so conceited, I wasn't interested in dating you!""

Just calmly respond: ""Oh okay, sorry! I just didn't want to make sure because I hate confusing situations, and just want to be friends going forward."" Don't get angry or upset, just say it in a cheerful, calm voice. 

I'm not going to lie: you're going to be dealing with situations like this for literally decades. Men are going to hit on you, and learning how to gracefully decline their attention is an important skill to learn. "
212,"To answer your initial question about ""passive asking."" He is *hearing* you ask, even if you aren't meaning to. Have a conversation saying, ""when I talk about things, I am simply talking, maybe getting your opinion, but I am not asking you to buy them for me."" I get where he is coming from though because my kids act like this sometimes. 

As for the rest of what you wrote- hooo boy. He wouldn't pay for a medical visit? That is some messed up shit. 

He laughed about the bra incident with a friend? That's some messed up shit.  

You guys have an unequal marriage right now and I would work to change ASAP. Until you do, stop letting him buy things for you since he is just going to throw it in your face later.

Good luck, OP!"
213,"May I jump in here and also suggest having a talk with your employer about having a bit of leeway or a few days off when your wife and baby are both home. This isn't the usual new baby whirlwind, this is much more serious. You need a bit of a break from work pressure right now. 

Hang in there OP, seek all the professional help you can get. Think about who you have in your personal support network, too. Are there any grandparents or other family in the picture? Are there any local parents or support groups you can contact? Remember, your job here isn't to fix it all yourself but to support your wife through the process of healing, cuddle your baby and take care of yourself, too. Hoping for the best for you, too."
214,"Right? Tracy is 24 years old, and dating a guy who is acting as a father to a child that is not his, because OP wants her child to have a father figure. That's a weird situation to be in, and everything she's done seems, at worst, like slightly awkward attempts to make the child feel welcome and included. Like was Tracy supposed to tell a four year old that she wasn't welcome in the family picture because James isn't her actual father? I don't know what OP wants, but Tracy doesn't seem like the bad guy in this situation. "
215,"How would you have navigated this event if you didn’t have a girlfriend?? 

I’m not defending her behavior, but your absolute reliance on her for introductions and networking came across as very immature/unprofessional. You should know how to do these situations solo if you have to, and in the case of your GF bailing on you socially, you had to. 

Meanwhile, constantly running back and forth between professional contacts and a very sullen and pouty looking woman all evening certainly did not help your professional credibility more than just doing it alone. 

You sort of screwed yourself as much as she did, buddy. "
216,"""He's so much older, and we don't have very much in common. I hope he finds someone closer to his age. I'll see if any of my friends' moms are single and interested."""
217,"You're an adult. Stop basing all of your decisions on what your mother wants. If you want to move, move. If you want to get married, get married. If you don't want a reception, don't have it, especially if you're mother isn't paying for it. Your mother is an adult. If she is going to have a temper tantrum over you eloping, then that's too bad.

You need serious therapy if you can't see why basing your decisions on your mother's feelings is bad. Basing your decisions on her feelings also isn't helping her psychologically."
218,"No one owns a name, unfortunately though I do think what your BIL and his wife are doing is not kind. However, your BIL should realize while he is allowed to do what he is doing, it is not the morally right thing to do nor is reacting with such a temper. It would be best to leave it where it is, hopefully he will come around and apologize.  "
219,"I'm not sure why Tracy is getting so much hate here. The situation is confusing as hell, maybe James hasn't made things super duper clear to her (or maybe he's tried, but it's so muddled she hasn't quite grasped that the kid he claims is his daughter shouldn't be treated as such by her? I know I would think that was weird as hell). But in any case, wanting to make OPs daughter feel welcome doesn't seem like the worst thing she could be doing, it's not like she kidnapped her or is having the kid call her mommy. It could easily have been a miscommunication with the photography thing, as well. OP is the one here who has issues with boundaries, and if she keeps having men play daddy only to remove them later, the kid is going to have issues. OP is lucky she had someone step up and take an interest in her kid, at all, quite frankly. "
220,Your boyfriend is a liar. And not a terribly good one. Next.
221,"From your comments - its clear that you would 
- move if he had to move 
- want to marry him
- think he's ""the one""

You also made it clear that 
- he will not move if you move 
- does not want to marry yet
- he does not think ""your the one"" 


Regardless of the career, and the move.. you have some massively different views on your relationship which isn't really great to begin with. 

As others said, 7 months is the honeymoon phase. Do you even live together yet? 

If this guy loved you, as much as you loved him, he would move because you said he could get a well paying job - anywhere. 

He values his friends &amp; his job more than you.

He said that **even if you stay, he nights not want to continue because he thinks you will have resentment**

Which means - you will turn down a job offer, for a guy who might leave you?!? 

Go chase your dream.  Go find someone who loves you as much as you love them. 
"
222,"I like the idea of asking if he knows them because you might get a suitable answer from him explaining the behavior.

That being said, if I were in your shoes, I'd honestly do a deep dive into his computer. "
223,"&gt;I begged him for weeks and felt like he wouldn’t even listen to my point of view. At one point he threatened to leave me if I kept asking to stay. He said we were better off in Denver, that he had been doing his research, that he had a plan and that I needed to trust him. I stupidly did. 

I'm going to respectfully disagree - he owns most of this."
224,"This is great advice. Hopefully it won't come to this, but this man is obviously unstable and abusive. He could definitely escalate his abuse either towards his family or towards you and your wife. Document everything you can because I'd bet money it'll be necessary for a future court case - even if he never tries to assault you/your wife, evidence of him being violent or aggressive will be useful to CPS.

I'm not sure how secure your house is, but maybe sure you have strong locks etc. Wouldn't put it past him to break in."
225,"If literally no one else in your life thinks you have bad breath including your doctor, you almost certainly don't have bad breath. I suppose it's possible that however your breath smells is specifically unpleasant to him, but I'm suspicious of that considering it's connected to the one thing you are (rightfully) on top of him about. It feels like he turned it around on you so you'd stop criticizing his oral hygiene. It's like when I gently told my ex I felt like he often focused on the negative and he told me *I* was the negative one. I'm an incredibly positive person but he had me doubting that, he just didn't want to be criticized. And just so you know, my ex was an asshole.

I'm not saying your fiance is an asshole necessarily, but I really don't like his behavior here. Either he's projecting or he truly felt this way for FIVE years and instead of gently bringing it up at some point, opted to avoid kissing you. It would break my heart if I were with someone who ""never liked kissing me.""

At the very least I would do some premarital counseling. It's a good idea anyway and maybe will give you both some ideas as to how to make his oral hygiene routine stick without you nagging him, because that's going to get really old at some point."
226,"I thought my baby was a reincarnation of my grandmother and was judging all my housekeeping and parenting skills. I'd close doors to the messiest rooms so she couldn't see them while we passed by. When I tell people they find it funny, but the thought occupied my every waking moment.

I'm so sorry you suffered with it. It's so scary when your reality changes so drastically."
227,"Whow, he seems like he really is targeting you.

It sounds like you're talking about Overwatch.

One thing you can do is always put on ""appear offline"" on battle net so he can't spectate you unless you're playing with someone he knows and decides to spectate them.

If that doesn't work out for you, I think you should directly stop him and tell him, one on one, that you dislike his attitude, and that as much as you have nothing against him in person or in other situations, you honestly don't enjoy playing with him when he keeps criticizing you.

Also, keep opening up and make sure it seems serious for someone in your group that is willing to take seriously how this is affecting you; they may be able to back you up or talk to this person.

I hope everything works out for you."
228,"I have no advice.

You and your step-mom sound like amazing people. Good on you for supporting her.

Your dad sounds like trash (sorry, not sorry) and you're probably better off without him in your life. So I would do nothing about that. (I guess that is advice...)"
229,"You know that saying, ""if everyone you meet is an asshole, you're probably the asshole?"" It sounds like she's as much a source of all this drama (if not the only source of this drama) as her endless string of terrible family, friends and romantic interests. 

It's a tough situation. I mean, you have the option of trying to talk to her about it, to mention that you sympathize but that you're trying to not have as much drama in your life and you'd like it if the two of you can focus on more positives aspects of your life. But that seems somewhat passive and likely to backfire. 

Dialling back the relationship also runs the risk of *you* becoming just another number in the line up of people who have started drama with her. I don't know. 

Do you want to maintain the friendship? it's perfectly natural and fine to grow apart from people, so don't feel guilty if you feel that way. Or are you hoping to mend things somewhat? Because if you are, I think you might have to come to terms with the reality that this is just who she is. "
230,"I totally agree, this must be awkward for Tracy and I think she's being great considering the situation. Most new gf would be adamant about him not spending any time with either the kid or OP"
231,"I had a friend who suffered from this and she said it was absolutely terrifying, because she knew in the back of her head that the things she believed probably weren't true, but her brain still convinced her that it was real. She was terrified of her baby and thought that somebody had broken into her house and replaced it with something...not human. She didn't understand why other people couldn't see there was something wrong with her baby. She ended up being admitted to hospital after she stopped feeding the baby altogether, because she thought that if she starved the ""fake baby"" to death, then whoever took her ""real baby"" would be forced to give it back. She's fine now and it ok about talking about it, but she still has PTSD from the painful birth and those first few months with PPP."
232,"Great advice. One of my favourite jobs after I ragequit law in 2008 (bullying and credit crunch lwere the relevant push factors) was an ombudsman type role where I had to investigate cases, make a finding of fact, apply the relevant codes/law and recommend a remedy.  It suited me down to the ground. And it was a great stepping stone to getting back into law at a later date. "
233,Also what about what the husband 'deserves'? Working 80 hours a week and helping take care of a special need child is a lot 
234,"&gt;I don’t want to ruin their home.

OP, your friend is destroying her own home. Instead of working on herself, she's disrespecting her spouse."
235,"As expensive as a non-refundable honeymoon might be, divorce costs a lot more.

Honestly, it sounds like she's deliberately sabotaging your engagement. I wouldn't wait around to find out why.
"
236,"I was this wife. My husband wanted to get another ring (still likes his original one, just wanted options) and I was totally against it. I was very sentimental and didn’t even like the idea of EVER taking my wedding band off my finger.

He bought himself a silicone ring and asked me to put it on him. When I did, he told me how much he loves me and that our marriage is about our love and not our rings. That got it through my head and then I was fine with it...and then I got a second ring too. :)"
237,I'd give her the information for the rehab. You can have someone else call her with the information so you're giving her help but not attention. And what she does next will show you whether she's serious about recovery or was just playing with your emotions.
238,"I know everyone is saying he’s projecting on you, and maybe he is, but the way you said it makes it sound like it was uncomfortable for him to admit it to you and you bringing it up gave him a chance to try to say it without hurting your feelings. I would look into possible sinus issues/tonsil stones, both can cause problems even with impeccable oral hygiene. "
239,"Everybody's saying that she has to trust you but are completely glossing over the fact that she gave you the hickey in the first place and is denying it, saying it's another person who did it.

Get out. This is weird and definitely not going to improve the longer you stay."
240,I imagine it as the ring equivalent to those black and red silky flame button ups that Guy Fieri would wear. 
241,"OP, this has reached call-her-doctor-yourself territory. If she won’t level with them, YOU need to, before your wife is beyond helping. She’s clearly in too deep to help herself right now. 

And get some help for yourself while you’re at it. Even if it’s just someone to unload all these feelings and struggles onto once a week. You do not have to carry all of this alone. Please take care of yourself while you figure out how to help your wife. You deserve help too, and your daughter needs at least one healthy parent in the house. You can’t be that for her if you’re burned out yourself. "
242,"Everyone recognizes she is day dreaming.  The SIL has been through a very shitty couple of years.  She is probably working a retail job to pay the bills, and is now panicking thinking about working at Wal-mart for the rest of her life.  They are pushing OP to be frank because they have probably tried and she is too desperate to see facts."
243,"There are lots of contradictory statements in this post:

\&gt; We aren't a couple

\&gt; We are dating exclusively

\&gt; I get happy and excited about meeting her about once a week. 

\&gt;   I don't have any feelings between our meetings 

\&gt; I feel overjoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like some personal therapy might be beneficial.  Everyone needs time to theirself, and it's not necessarily bad to only want to meet once a week.  That may increase naturally over time as well.  If everything else is good, OP should work with his SO to find a balance of spending time together that makes them both happy."
244,"\&gt; My brother passed away last week and I've got to arrange my notes for his service 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever slight inclination I had that you should talk things out with your fiance has just died.  You should definitely leave her.  Her level of insensitivity is ridiculous."
245,You can’t marry a checklist. She’s good on paper but there’s no chemistry. Do her a favor and move on. 
246,Exactly. Could never be with someone who didn’t like my dogs 😕. You’re doing the right thing for your dog. Ignore your most recent soon-to-be ex (I hope).
247,"This is a bizarre situation in the first place. If you break up with a guy who isn’t the father, then he doesn’t stick around and act like daddy. That’s not fair to the child. Don’t leave your kid with him anymore. "
248,Thank you so much for your kind words. I think most people in this thread are echoing my own thoughts. Lots of people have made good points about what the best course of action is- I’m definitely leaning towards reading up on laws in my country regarding harassment to see if the police will take me seriously. I’m becoming worried the longer this goes on. 
249,"You need to talk to her doctor immediately. He can have her committed. 

Right now."
250,Ya this is the only answer that matters. How on earth could you be ok with your HUSBAND saying he wouldn't pay for that? You are MARRIED. Not roommates or friends. This is sad on so many levels.
251,"I (34F) have a very close friend (33M) that is part of my gaming group. He’s got a big personality, which is great, but for awhile there when we were playing together and getting to know each other, he started ramping up the ‘jokes’ and criticisms towards me to an almost unbearable level. For reference, it sounds like a similar scenario to your story in that we’re a close match skill-wise (I actually by far outrank him on our main game!) 🤓 Anyway, his ragging on me got to a point where it was really bothering me and making me not want to be around him. So finally one day, I just said “Hey, do you even like me?” He was flabbergasted and asked what I meant. I said “Seriously, the digs have been constant, I feel like I can’t do anything right around you and I’m honestly wondering if you even like me and want me around?” He immediately turned bright red and stammered about how I’m one of his favorite people. That day was a literal game-changer! His behavior completely turned around, and while everyone in our group still ribs each other, I no longer feel picked on and my friend and I have an awesome relationship. 

Def not saying everything is always that easy, just putting in my experience that simply speaking up directly in my case really helped. 🙂

Very best of luck to you with this! I know that friend issues are difficult. You seem like a super cool person, and I hope you’re able to find a good resolution!

Cheers!"
252,"Yup yup, can even wear the ring on a chain inside your shirt."
253,"He showed you his true colors, believe him and leave. He told you he's embarrassed of you and thinks you don't take enough care of your appearance to be with him, don't be with someone like that. "
254,"Yes he's probably cheating on you again by your description and even if he isn't, you don't trust him and he doesn't seem to be meeting your needs in the relationship. The fact that he isn't even willing to do couples counseling with you just shows you how little he's invested in the relationship IMO. I don't see this relationship surviving tbh OP."
255,"Agree with this. If you're paying her for the ""damaged"" bra then it's yours. And also, she's gross. Who doesn't wash their bras? "
256,"Agreed, being emotional due to anxiety, depression, and pregnancy is very much clouding my judgement. "
257,"Silver lining, now she knows how her boyfriend behaves during a tough time and can dump his unsupportive ass."
258,"Nope. Nope. Nope. You said over and over it was too much and to stop and he disrespected you by ignoring you.

Sometimes abuse is disguised as a joke. 

If you're saying you don't like it and he's willfully ignoring your reasonable request this can be termed abusive. "
259,"&gt;said that she'd feel more comfortable trying with strangers

your friend has the right idea.

I believe you are just reading to much into this, and feeling a bit rejected and jealous. I doubt you have to worry about your friend as she already could of tried to be with him before you guys were together, but she chose not to."
260,"I was going to suggest that her mom could walk her down the aisle too, seems like a lovely solution."
261,You're delusional. There is even a huge difference between a 22 year old and a 25 year old. Cut that pedo shit out.
262,"By the sounds of how OP described the ring, it's likely made of materials that can't just be melted and recast - stainless steel and tungsten are most popular for making these rings as it's a durable but cheap material."
263,"&gt;Ask your wife to read this post.

I agree.  He needs to be totally open and honest with his wife.  And explain why he can't be that blunt with SIL.
"
264,"&gt; Wait, if your parent is trans, that's not a mental illness, that's just your parent coming out as trans.

He didn't necessarily say that.  He said his Dad was trans...but his Dad could also be dealing with mental illness ON TOP OF being trans.  

Or maybe a 60 year old person suddenly coming out as trans could be a sign of mental illness.  Pointing that out is not in and of itself transphobic.  Thats a major life change at an old age, and definitely could be the signs of some mental illness.  

At the end of the day, as of right now, who gives a shit?  Much bigger fish to fry.  Lets make sure everyone lives before we try to rail on him.  Thats a completely different post that he should make after he has a functional wife and a baby thats alive."
265,Just wanted to give you a shout out on the “this is the exact for-profit schools prey on” part of your advice because that the truth.  Regardless of the law school part.  
266,I agree with everything they said. I just wanted to add that it's really cool that you're facing your own biases (especially this young)!
267,"You shouldn't live with somebody like this. Face it, you tried it, he's not a respectful roommate, and not a person who is capable of adulting, so you move out. Then you re-evaluate the relationship.

Why so extreme of a reaction? Because this isn't just some minor communication issue. This is a major personality issue. It's an entitlement issue. It's a disrespectul issue. It's an issue where he sees you, not as a girlfriend with valid work, but as a slave or as a mom who caters to him.

Don't stick around and try to change people who have that issue. They don't change.

"
268,"This used to happen with my ex.  He was the first person I slept with, and I figured it was normal for sex to hurt, and just kind of gritted my teeth and bared it.  That's not how its supposed to be.  I wasn't relaxed or turned on with him.  And I obviously wasn't enjoying it.  I didn't realize until later how obvious that should have been to him, when partners later would stop and check if I was okay, or continue foreplay, or say slow down if I gasped or winced.  When I realized other partners noticed when I was experiencing even a little bit of pain or discomfort, it made me realize that my ex really should have noticed.  I was gritting my teeth in pain, incredibly tense, obvious signs I wasn't enjoying things, but I kind of thought that was just what sex was like, at least at first.  I knew it usually hurt the first time, and figured maybe the pain would go away after a few months, but that's really not how it works.  Your boyfriend should be able to not hurt you during sex, and should be noticing when you are in pain.  It's unacceptable that he's not trying to make this a pleasant, or even just bearable experience for you.  "
269,"If he just 'sits there in silence' I'd consider that a warning sign. Try and sit him down and explain that not only is it incredibly distracting for you, it's quite hurtful that he's ignoring your needs "
270,Wow. Now you know. Not even your boyfriend had your back. That's something I would never get over
271,"For you, this conversation was, first and foremost, your coming out. For him, the main point in the conversation was that it was the end of his relationship.

I think you're maybe being a bit unrealistic with your expectations of him here, he's only human and your leaving has probably hurt him a lot, despite being unavoidable and necessary."
272,"So... you're banking on him getting married, having a kid, *losing his wife,* and then reconnecting with you and getting back together?

Um."
273,"This is a great, insightful post. As someone whose partner spent almost a decade in a job she mostly hated, I think it's important to consider whether any of those three questions/points are valid. It's exhausting to hear your partner constantly complain about their job, even if it is legitimately difficult. You should be able to vent on occasion, of course, but if there's any chance that everything your boyfriend hears about your job is negative and/or you complain about it constantly and/or you're comparing your job to his on a regular basis...then it might explain his apparent lack of empathy. 

Otherwise, I agree, your boyfriend is just a jerk."
274,Have you tried discussing the issue with her outside of when you two are trying to start something? Maybe she’ll be a bit more willing to listen to your concerns and compromise with you if she’s cooled off. 
275,"I did this on a bouquet of one of my bridesmaids (family member) so that her father was ""somewhat"" with her that day. She loved it. I found the idea by Googling for things to do for someone with a recent loss, so it definitely wasn't my idea, but it went over big. 10/10 recommend"
276,I see a bunch of immature behavior here. Why exactly did your gf think it was ok to go through your phone without your permission? And your reaction that led to you not going to the party is immature as well.
277,"If she travels for work, her workplace likely either provides her lodging or they're offering her a per diem for housing that she's just pocketing when she stays for you for free. It's her employer's job to house her during work-related travel, not yours."
278,"I agree with what you're saying but I want to add on that his difference in how he views the relationship is almost certainly not because he's selfish or doesn't care about her, but because he has a lot of years of life experience on her and knows that a 7-month relationship is not a good reason to throw away a job you love in a place you love surrounded by friends you love. He's being realistic while she's being idealistic."
279,"I spent a little while working as a hospital chaplain. Two thoughts:

1) There is a difference between feeling empathy and dwelling. The trick to the work (and why I ultimately didn't decide to pursue it for longer than I did) is being able to let the emotions flow through you and out the other side. So you might feel sadness and empathy, but the goal is to not sit in the sadness, but let it out and move on, whether that's through meditation, praying for your customers, music, some little ritual at the end of the day, etc. I was really bad at this in a hospital setting, but I'm much better at it in my current work.

2) There is a difference between feeling empathy and over identifying. It wouldn't surprise me that if you are really dwelling on your work, it has a lot to do with your own fears and feelings about getting old and what might happen to you. And part of being successful in the work will be just being present with the people you work with and not turning their stuff into your stuff. Like there's a difference between being sad because Mrs. Joyce's family doesn't visit and ruminating on what might happen if YOUR family doesn't visit when you are old.

3) Know the limits of what you can do. You can provide and friendly and sympathetic ear, genuinely care for your customers, be professional and helpful, etc. You cannot be a substitute for their family, be their friend, solve all their problems, or take away their health problems. Know what you can do for them, do it to the best of your ability, and they will appreciate what you are doing. But know that you cannot be all things to all people. You cannot save people from suffering. And if you can accept that and still do your best at your job, then this is the job for you."
280,[removed]
281,He’s a jerk. Tell him he no longer has to be embarrassed because you’re breaking up with him. He shouldn’t have dated ypu if he was bothered by your face. 
282,"You absolutely cannot leave the baby at home alone with her. PLEASE listen to this advice. I was in a support group with a very famous person who is now locked up for killing her children during PPD, and what you describe takes me back to how she used to describe how she was feeling. This is very very serious."
283,"She's reached out to you in several ways in this narrative but she's not reaching far enough for you. She did ask you to take a bath with her. She did ask for a massage. She did come back in the room. She's extending olive branches and you're telling her to reach farther. 

If you need her to reach farther, which I would agree with, you have to give positive encouragement to how far she did reach. She's dipping a toe and you're making it uncomfortable, so why would she jump in? 

You guys are getting trapped in a loop, and inevitably the responses will be ""why should he have to blah blah blah"". You shouldn't. But when you don't, you participate in the loop. When you retort ""aren't you"", you're in the loop. When you ""Well what"", you're in the loop.  Change the narrative.

""Aren't you going to initiate?""

""Is that what you really wanted when you asked for a massage? I didn't want to assume.""

""Well?""

""Well, I'm glad you came back in and I'm sorry we've been misunderstanding each other. Can we talk about ways to get better at this?"""
284,"Not only does she not like dogs but she’s trying to make this awful traumatic moment about her. Nope, pass. 

OP, I just lost my family dog a few months ago. I’m so sorry for your loss. Truly, there is nothing good about this except that you get to do a final act of kindness for your lovely good boy. Let me just say that 3 months later, it hurts a lot less and I can just laugh at all the dumb stuff my dog used to do and not cry every time I think about him. It gets better, but I’m sorry it sucks now. "
285,"I think it would help if you and your sister just went all out. Say it's unacceptable behaviour and that she not just deserves better but can have it better. That if she decides to divorce him, you will both help her find a place, an attorney, figure things out, help her get settled etc. Like, make her feel like divorce is an acceptable and really safe option. I'm sure she's scared. If she feels like it is actually an option, she might be more inclined to leave him."
286,"I've been in the same shoes as your fiance, and honestly I'm still working my way through it. My poor boyfriend was dealing with my mental breakdowns on a monthly basis. I started getting better for him, because I love him and I didn't want him to be in the position you are now. If she can't handle herself, she won't be able to handle her share of a healthy and loving relationship. I would suggest giving her a choice to make. Either she starts taking her mental health seriously or you call off the wedding. Tell her (gently) how her negativity is starting to affect you, because you deserve to be happy too. "
287,"You are insanely overreacting. Nothing bad happened here, the photographer wanted a fake family photo for promo purposes, got one, you complained, your child's image was removed. So, relax. Clarify your philosophy about your child being photographed and move on with your life. No feelings were hurt here except by your overreaction.

The only person acting out a charade that your child is James's is you. You're being really weird. If he is a pseudo father, he did nothing wrong. If he's not, stop leaving your child with him. "
288,Thank you. I do think guilt clouds my judgement in this situation.
289,alternatively: dump her. now.
290,"Hey, perspective from the other side. I'm in a relationship very similar to yours with roles reversed. I recently got out of the hospital and subsequent program due to an episode associated with my BP1 and am dating a dreamboat of a man. We actually had a conversation yesterday about this exact topic. 

To me it sounds like your boyfriend is trying to get back on track and is motivated to stay clean (which props for a previous 10 years of sobriety, I can't even go 3 months). He's probably trying to ask about the strength of the relationship because he's just had this big episode and is probably too nervous to directly ask where he stands with you. He is probably just probing to see if you want out of the relationship  or if you feel the same as you did about him before the episode. People with mental disorders are not oblivious to how our disease affects the people around us. While he's talking about marriage I'm sure he doesn't mean next week, but wants to see if you're still on board to progress the relationship at some point in the future. And it's okay if you're not ready to do marriage now, just be honest about that and say when both your lives settle down we can talk more about getting married. But if that's not your end goal with him, it sounds like you two do not have  the same priorities and it would be unfair to string him along.

But I wouldn't discount him just because of this one thing. Now if he has a history of multiple episodes a year which put him in and out of the hospital constantly and a continuing drug habit, it may be time to step away. But more often than not people with mh issues lead pretty normal lives with the right treatment  plan. Many people go on to be great spouses and parents. 

That's just my two cents. But goodluck! I hope you both find happiness and stability in your lives."
291,Maybe her therapist? I have a support system that doesn’t include family or people whose house I can stay in. 
292,"&gt; I told her I needed her to be my wing man in meeting people. I don't like talking to people on my own. For example, if I say hi to someone, it would be ""Hi my name is *****. I shot the pictures of the actress"" which sounds boastful. But if my GF is with me, I can introduce myself, she can introduce herself and be like ""What do you think of *****'s photos of the actress?"".

&amp;

&gt; I should also mention that I saw this photographer's girlfriend meeting people at the party and bringing them back to talk to him.

Not trying to be a jerk, but you specifically mention twice that you expected or hoped that your girlfriend would function as your promoter at this event. Don’t get me wrong - I still think she’s a crappy girlfriend for not bothering to stand next to you &amp; make small talk at a work event. But you definitely also seem upset that she wasn’t doing the promotional rounds for you, based on writing these things as part of your post. And I think that really muddies the conversation because she can argue back that she felt uncomfortable approaching strangers to talk you up, especially if that’s not something she’s done before or something you brought up with her before the event. So still break up with her for being a bad girlfriend, but also be honest with yourself about your expectations. "
293,"I agree with you in general, but I doubt that OP's fiancee doesn't understand OP's POV. Rather, I think she's not ready to cope emotionally and worries that watching OP's father give a father-of-the-bride speech will be too painful and that pain will color the entire day. I've lost a close family member myself and there's no way I would have been able to cope with this situation one year out.

I think CBT, ongoing grief therapy, and delaying the wedding until the fiancee is prepared to cope will be the best solution. "
294,"He obviously left his child with the person he saw best fit. 
There’s a time and a place for everything lyralady, this is neither the time nor the place. "
295,"&gt;  mother of the children &lt;not on&gt; your side


This is by far the most important piece of info. The wife would not have let slip the CPS call info if she had realized this sooner. The mother is with this man for a reason, despite her seeing FIRST HAND what he is like. I understand most of the yelling happens when she is not home...but still, she has to have some idea. The mother is on the abusers side, not yours OP.
"
296,"If he's fresh out of jail he may have a parole officer that you can get in touch with. Pretty sure child abuse violates parole and the fear of going back to jail might pucker his butthole enough to get him to relax. If not just keep calling the cops, either he'll figure it out or he'll go away again. Definitely don't let him intimidate you either. You don't have to escalate but you don't have to take his shit. If you're confident in your punch taking abilities you could get a video of him losing his temper and hitting you and that's a guarantee he will go back to jail and everyone will get some peace and quiet."
297,"You have a lot going on personally - stuff you haven’t event disclosed to your wife - and here you are here, solely for *her* in this moment when she desperately needs you, but was unable to ask for help.  This experience speaks volumes for your character and when she comes out of the fog and sees you there, she is going to know exactly how much you love here. "
298," 

If the neighbor is bad enough that he's willing to extend his abuse to you in an effort to intimidate you, think of what he's doing to the kids and SO from whom he needn't fear reprisal. Personally, I'd probably call the police every time I heard disturbing noises and continue making CPS reports. It doesn't sound like the mother is willing/able to stand up to him and those kids have to depend on society to protect them because their parents won't. I have empathy for the woman involved here, but that doesn't mean I excuse her actions.

We have police and CPS for a reason. You are not attempting to get the children taken away, you're trying to prevent them from being hurt. IME (my brother is a verbally abusive jerk and we've helped my SIL get free of him) CPS will often just insist that the abuser move out and require therapy for the mom and kids. Now, she risks losing them if she doesn't stick to it, but there's nothing anyone can do about that besides her.

Also realize that your reports will assist her in getting a protective order in the event she does decide to stand up to him. Good luck, OP and thank you for standing up for tiny humans that can't stick up for themselves."
299,"Why are you living dime to dime when your HUSBAND has plenty?  Usually when you get married, you combine assets, or at least pay with an eye to percentages of income for household expenses"
300,"Not the person who had the original idea, but I think presenting it as a custom-made, one-of-a-kind piece of silk that you kept trimming ""for her"" so you could feel like you were involved in her hobby is a good comparison there.  She had a plan for it, she had a perfect picture worked out in her mind, she'd put hours of prep work into the bag and told her friends, she asked you repeatedly to use other silk if you wanted to feel involved, and she came home and you'd cut it into an unusable snowflake.

But make sure you emphasize that it's the betrayal of trust and her prioritizing her whims over your feelings about your hobby that's bothering you more than the game.  She might be someone who genuinely doesn't care about physical things and so it's not a boundary to her if you shred her entire silk collection, but if she can't grasp that boundaries are important and she doesn't value you enough to respect yours, then she isn't going to understand your boundaries about your body, your health, your family, your friends, or your relationship either, and that's a really important factor in any relationship."
301,"&gt; short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)

TBH I agree with your friend, a vow renewal would be ideal. It doesn't have to be expensive or the ""nuclear option"" by any means, it can be small and intimate, private and low-cost. There's so much more flexibility with a renewal, it doesn't have to be like a second wedding. 

I think it would be a good idea to add in a small ceremony of removing the old ring or having it made into a keepsake such as a necklace or placed in a display case to commemorate the past, present and future together. Don't deny your past, embrace the growth you have made both as individual and as a couple."
302,"I love this suggestion!! I think if OP suggested he wants one that matches hers, it would bring her on board.  "
303,"I don't believe you should think anything is wrong with you nor does it seem like a mental illness issue. And even as a child feeling like that? You are having physical reactions to him, the revulsion, and he has made some questionable statements about your body. Can you access a therapist maybe who could help you with this? I'm not saying your dad is a bad person but also don't place fault or blame on yourself for this instinctive reaction. "
304,"Good Lord your dad is a doofus. It's not a big deal having the hots for an attractive friend/acquaintance but for the love of God don't admit it while your wife is in the room. I don't think there's anything you can do in this situation other than be nice to your mom. She's going to be crushed, but there's not going to be any fixing it, and any amends will have to come from your dad, not you. Give your mom a hug from me and tell her she's great just as she is."
305,"He's your ex now. It's absolutely not his job to console you anymore or even do it while you were breaking up with him. I know that sucks and hurts, but that's part of breaking up. You're not going to find closure by trying to talk to him and force it out. You can't say ""I don't want to be with you anymore romantically, I'm not attracted to you anymore and am gay, but I need you to be there for me, validate me and make me feel good about my choice."" You just have to move on and find people who will accept you and support you. "
306,"I don't know what to tell you except that I also made a terrible mistake of moving while pregnant once and I too felt absolutely desperate and depressed when I made the mistake. It's almost 2 years on and things have improved. It's still a massive regret for me. My partner still wants to stay. I chose him over going back and things have 'worked out'. He has a better job. My career prospects are looking good. But...I miss my home. I miss our family and friends. You have to make an incredibly difficult decision. What do you think would be best for your baby? That is what will make you happiest too. Whichever way you go, you're going to have some regrets though."
307,"The word you’ve used “frame” reminds me of something. 

OP if you upgrade both rings, you could get a box frame and keep your first set of rings displayed in your home, as a memento of your wedding day and wall decoration in one. That way it’s not like you’re hiding it away, and it gives the impression you are proud rather than ashamed of that piece of your history, but only friends and family welcomed into your home will be the ones who see it. "
308,"Is your fiancee's mother in the picture?  Could she give a speech?  Maybe focus less on ""I want my father to do traditional father things at our wedding"" and more on ""I want both our families to be involved in our wedding."" There's no reason why your fiancee's mom couldn't take on the traditional father stuff at the wedding (unless she's not around or they're not close)."
309,"Yeah, I also have a hard time keeping tears at bay when I'm upset or even angry, and sometimes it's a cruel cycle because more often than not, I'm mad at myself. 

But sobbing? Pouting? A tantrum? No. If I so much as am unable to speak without my voice cracking, I ask for a moment."
310,"Absolutely terrifying. I honestly think these experiences are at the root of some of the old stories about changelings, where women have to throw the fairy child on the fire or try and squeeze it into an acorn so the fairies give back the real baby. It seems like a way of making sense of something horrifying that women would have experienced before we understood it as we do today."
311,You know what’s really not sexy? Tetanus. 
312,"Seven month relationship versus a golden opportunity, take the job. You're young and have plenty of opportunity to establish new relationships in your new location. Your professor and your family recognize the better option for you. Your boyfriend encouraged you to interview so he wasn't blind to the possibilities, he wanted the best for you even if he wasn't in that picture.
"
313,"I think your insecurity here is just a symptom of three other major problems: 

1! You’re dating a guy who has cheated on you and who is looking to continue to do so (insert secret profile seeking third party women while in a monogamous relationship) 

2) Because of problem 1, him not loving every single part of your body feels like a real threat

3) You’re in a relationship with an asshole you aren’t compatible who has no respect for your boundaries and who goes behind your back to get what he wants instead of being honest about the relationship not really being his speed. "
314,"Why can't he get a job doing something else for a year then go back into his field when you move?  Maybe fix his skill deficiency on the side so that he doesn't run into the same problem again.

Anyone with basic computer and communication skills will be reasonably functional in a general office job.  Twice in my life so far I've lost my employment, once through budget cuts, and once I was fired after a disagreement with my boss on a legal issue.  Neither time was I off work more than 2- 3 weeks.  I immediately went to the local ""office work"" temp agency and told them I needed general office work and had it within a week or two.  Granted, I was only making $11-$12/hr instead of the $18-$20 I was getting in my field at the time, but once I had solid work, I was much more confident when sending out resumes for actual jobs in my field.  And working 40 hours a week during the day and then another 10 or 12 hours a week delivering pizza wasn't too burdensome and kept the household afloat."
315,"Reception is a really hard job a lot of the time, but my god does it ever give you a great insight into the other roles at a company/the company's culture. This would be a really good way for her to approach the field, and might be an eye-opener."
316,"Forget the cold logic of “no one owns a name”. 

Bro is well aware that she will feel pain every time she hears the name. 

“Just a name”? Yep. And he can and should choose another. They’re being petty. You’re not asking for much here. Let them run the relationship into the ground. "
317,"This was my first thought.  This guy lacks empathy, which isn't a surprise, considering that he is 28 and helps his friend make prank videos for a living.  So his lack of empathy towards his gf and for the people she is responsible for isn't surprising in the least. "
318,"You created an unreasonable situation where you want your ex to play daddy to your daughter but want his partner to somehow have nothing to do with her. And you’re way overthinking his girlfriend’s comments and I think it’s odd that you’re making her out to be a crazy lady trying to steal your daughter. Considering you turn everything she does into something more sinister than it most likely is, I think it’s reasonable to think the issue with the photographer was a misunderstanding or that she didn’t realize it was a big deal."
319,"&gt;  (I understand people on this thread have a lot of opinions about cheating but it’s not always the end of a relationship). 

I mean your relationship doesn't seem to be an example of where you've actually worked through it completely. From what you've told us, it sounds a lot like this relationship has run its course quite some time ago, however, after the cheating and your personal life-changing events, your bf felt guilty and came back.... Deep down though, he probably always had doubts."
320,You didn't cross a line and there's no reason for you to be continually punished for nothing.
321,"Your ring obviously holds a lot of sentimental value for your wife, and I think that's really important to acknowledge. If you want to get a new ring, I suggest you approach it in a way that recognizes the emotional aspect, not just appearance.

""Wife, when I look at Old Ring, it reminds me of when we first got married and how happy we were.  And in the last 10 years, we've made so many more great memories. I would love to get something that makes me think of not just our wedding day, but every happy day we've had since then. Would you help me pick out something that symbolizes that?""

And come up with some reasons why New Ring is symbolic of your relationship now, and do something with Old Ring that will feel meaningful to her."
322,"And let's be serious, how is her assumption ""OP is walking into PP to get an abortion"" and not ""OP is picking up her pills"" or ""OP has a UTI"" or ""OP is getting a pap smear"" or whatever? She sounds like a horrible, shitty asshole."
323,"I eventually was put on a SSRI when I broke down in tears at an OB appt.  I didn’t share with even her what I was going through.

With my second pregnancy, I was put on a SSRI prophylactically and didn’t suffer PPD that time. "
324,"I think you need to accept that this is your life now and respect your husbands wishes. He has very valid points based on sacrifices you both have to make. If this is the only issue you have with your husband, and given the extra stress you have as parents this says a lot on its own, I would make my peace with not having any more children. You don’t have any other viable options. "
325,No 18 year old worth dating is interested in 14 year olds.
326,"I dated someone addicted to video games, and I'm going to tell you right now, if she's not willing to go to counseling or accept that this is a problem, you need to get out now. It won't change, and any attempts from you to get her to stop playing will be turned around so that you're the problem. It might sound silly, but it's just like any other addiction. It's not up to you to change her, you just need to take care of yourself."
327,"A list of all his sins? That's werid. Why keep a rap sheet.

Seems odd"
328,"It might be minor, but remember 'you' aren't making her cry, she is crying due to her reaction. Sounds like there's alot of codependency, and responsibility for other peoples feelings going on. "
329,"&gt;She also pouts a lot when she's not full-on crying, and it makes me a little less attracted to her. She does this thing where she presses her brows together, sticks out her chin, and pushes her lower lip out. It makes her look like an angry child, and I can't stand looking at her when she's doing that. She'll stomp around the house making that face, turning her head to look at me so I don't miss out on the fact that she is VERY MAD at me. 

I have a visceral reaction to this mental image. Is there such a thing as rage nausea?

Some people are just easy criers and have a hard time overcoming it. Your girlfriend, however, is an emotional child. I give her the benefit of the doubt that the crying and pouting might have been learned as a response to abuse, but I couldn’t image staying in the same room with her if she was doing that face or even looking at her again. "
330,This isn't convince her to go therapy. This is get her evaluated even if you have to contact her a lawyer and make her go into a 72 hour hold. She needs a lot more than outpatient therapy and may be a danger herself or to the baby. 
331,"You didn't do anything wrong and if he can't get over this, you should just move on. His insecurities aren't an excuse to be a shitty partner to you and you should stop dating this jerk IMO."
332,And if he says that isn't a good enough reason or continues to push the issue that's a major red flag. 🚩🚩🚩
333,Because a good chunk of people in certain areas believe that PP does nothing but abortions and there is little anyone can do to convince them otherwise.
334,"Yeah, this was the nail in the coffin, OP. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. "
335,"its only 100 dollars, he has said he'll be paying us back ""next week"" since I think September. So that could be part of it, but like I said he has a very bad temper and doesn't handle things very well."
336,"You do not deserve another child. Your son does not deserve a sibling.

Your husband DESERVES to decide he can't handle any more stress, which another child (even a perfectly healthy one) would be.

You are being intensely selfish. Raise the child you have. "
337,"Would you want to continue dating someone who believes their best &amp; longest romance was with a developing teenager when they were 25?

I think it’s a simple yes or no question. What’s your first gut answer? (And you already answered that by how you’re reacting)

Don’t hold yourself emotionally hostage to him. Don’t let your romantic feelings for him make him an exception to your morals &amp; values.

I personally would instantly dump him. "
338,"r/relationships doesn’t allow pictures, any post with a picture gets deleted. But you can google men’s wedding band black fire opal and a ton of pics come up that I think for his description."
339,"&gt;Yes, we do split everything 50/50 - **that's how we did it too when I was the only one with a job** and he was still in grad school. **I have mentioned percentages to him, as suggested by a third party, and he recoiled from that saying he felt it wasnt fair.** I tabled the discussion for another day.

Huge. Red. Flag."
340,I agree with this. He felt like helping her through her operation/recovery would absolve him of his guilt over cheating but is really just going through the motions. I'm actually angry at this guy; the comment he made about her looking through his phone.... that shows her that he literally isn't thinking about her feeling at all. He is just thinking of himself and not getting caught. OP please leave this guy you are young enough right now at this very moment to start over and be happy. You deserve more 
341,"&gt; Plus, if I let her go home, I would have been sad the rest of the night.

I don't think you're entirely in the wrong in the OP but holy shit do you sound like a petulant man-baby with this."
342,"Before I start, I am so sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is heartbreaking. 

I think you're in the right for sure. Do whats best for you and your dog (who she didn't even like). 

Right now, your dog **needs** you and she deserves to be surrounded by people who actually love her, when she passes away. You will regret not being there for your dog, and ex as well, far more than going along with your current girlfriend's irrational complaints.

&gt; She doesn't trust me (nothing has ever happened with me and my ex since the break up) and she says she's upset because I'm not taking her feelings into consideration. 

This is very telling. Honestly, once you are back from the Humane Society, you may want to have a serious thought about why you're with your current girlfriend. So many red flags.

**She's making this hard time even harder for you. She doesn't trust you. She's making herself the victim when it has literally nothing to do with her. (Also, she hates dogs, that's a deal breaker for me, but that may be a bit irrelevant).** 

She sounds immature and just.. Cruella.

343,"If she was ambitious with a promising career and quit suddenly and has no motivation and is crying all day, this suggests some kind of mental illness, rather than her being a 'gold digger' or what all the guys in the comments are talking about.

If you are not prepared to or willing to stick with her through a mental health crisis (which is fine and no one would judge you for it!), you need to have that talk with her. If you'd like to stay together and help her get help, you need to have THAT talk with her."

I'm sorry to say that she's out of her mind. You *only* send a few messages a day? What is her expectation, that you message her every hour? Why? What fresh hell is this.   


Admittedly I'm a little over 10 years older than you so perhaps this is a generational thing, but even my very best friends and I will only message every couple of weeks or so.   


No. You're not a bad person at all. I would say your desire to be less connected is a good thing and your friends are wildly out of sync with what I would call ""normal""."
346,"It’s not fair of her to make you cut your dad out. I understand she’s probably hurting and the reason she’s doing this is because in a sense she doesn’t want to see you with your dad since she cannot be with hers. 

However it’s just unfair. I wouldn’t compromise on that, and I would make it clear. 

“I love you but I need this for me.” 

You can say anything you want to say, it’s just all about how you say it. "

348,"I attended a wedding where the mother of the bride walked her daughter down the aisle while holding a portrait of her deceased husband and then sat the picture frame in the chair next to her for the ceremony. I thought it was a nice way for the bride to keep her dad’s memory alive and present, but she was also in a place where she could see his image without breaking down crying. Everyone is going to need something different, and I think OP and her fiancé should consider some ways of incorporating the fiancé’s father into the ceremony."
349,"Jesus. Sixteen years old is way too young to be putting up with this bullshit. Relationships are supposed to make your life better, not stressful/worse. The chances that this kid is the man you'll eventually marry are slim to none, so I'd recommend you end what sounds like a pretty awful, untrusting relationship and focus on yourself, and growing up, rather than on defending yourself for a total non-crime that happened many, many months ago."

Plus, people gossip. You should have sent her home. Yeah, your friends would know that it's not normal, but this is a WORK event. -1 for having girlfriend very unhappy, and people will score that as part of their first impression. And of course because she's unhappy, you don't know if she said anything that might have hurt your reputation. "
354,"So you not wanting to spend all day texting is fine. You don't owe anybody your mental energy or time.

But maybe some of it is just because you used to text all day?

You only have to worry if its been \[36 hours\]. If you need me for something right there and then, call me because I won't have notifications on.

Several of my friends come to mind: one works intake at a pediatric hospital, one is a firefighter and one is a speech pathologist who works with at-risk children. I myself am a teacher. My job is not without its tough days. But I would never dream of comparing apples-to-apples with these friends, who regularly deal with things like suicide victims, babies with terminal illnesses and 4-year-olds who have been raped... these problems are catastrophic, far beyond the norm for most jobs and are absolutely emotionally traumatic for the people assisting with them firsthand. Please recognize this and give yourself grace on the fact that you are dealing with things that just plain *are* more difficult than the average work stress.

If I have any advice on your post, it’s this: I feel like it’s up to you to decide whether you feel that the atmosphere and general attitude/care level your boyfriend displays feels sustainable in the long term. Is he a caring and empathetic person? Is he truly supportive of you? Your career aside, you deserve to be with a partner who holds you up, sees you through the best possible light and helps you through your struggles. (I’ll admit I may be working from a semi-high standard; I’ve been happily married for 10+ years to a man who is so incredibly caring and genuinely supportive of me that he tends to make other guys look like angry, fumbling gorillas by comparison...) 

Very best regards and good luck to you, OP. I hope you’re able to find a happy and healthy resolution here. ❤️"
356,"It's literally a nuclear powder keg. Not only the wife, but OP himself is in danger. 

There are cases where the entire family is killed in such cases. "
357,"I’d send out a group email/message explaining the situation and your emotions regarding their despicable actions/responses. To all of them. Outline how you want to progress going forward, whether you expect an apology or you’ll be cutting contact. Make it clear how out of order they were. If they won’t apologize or make amends then scorch that earth. 

Thinking of you in the middle of this situation and sending good vibes. Xx"
358,I wear a silicone ring for work and the minister who married us offered to bless it. The real wedding ring is in a fancy box with other wedding mementos when I'm not wearing it.
359,"You were upfront and communicated all this to her and you acted the best you could with the information you were given, and when that changed you apologize and adjusted course. You can't beat yourself up for not knowing what was unknown or hidden from you.

That said, you can't let your guilts about your past behavior in past relationships lead you into trying to ""atone"" in ways that negatively affect your current relationship. Your ex's situation is no longer your responsibility and it's on her to seek the support she needs. You gotta let your ex be and move on. "
360,"First off, you guys need therapy, both individually and as a couple.

Second, I...really see where your husband is coming from.

&gt; having a child with severe disabilities is hard. Brett works between 70 to 80 hours a week. I work a flexible enough job that I can be home with Ryan and take him to all appointments. To help us cope with Ryan, we receive respite care occasionally, are a part of parent support groups and do therapy. [...] Despite both of us working a lot of our money goes towards Ryan’s medical needs.

So he's basically working two full time jobs, you're working, and you are receiving external help, you have no time, and you have no money.

...that doesn't....sound like the right time to have a kid to me?

&gt;  If we did have a normal child, he doesn’t want she or he to feel that Ryan was more important. Also, he doesn’t want that child to think that it is their duty to take care of Ryan when we die.

Also very valid points.

&gt; I got angry and argued that I deserved to have another child and Ryan deserved a sibling. 

And some *invalid* points.  You don't *deserve* to be in the situation you're in, but that doesn't mean you aren't in it.  This just sounds, bluntly, selfish and almost delusional.  Responding to someone explaining why something may be inadvisable or even impossible with ""but I deserve it!"" isn't a great look.  He's not denying you a slice of cake.  What about what you husband deserves?  **What about what the future child deserves?**

&gt;  Now I’m at a crossroads, I do want another child, but I don’t want to lose my husband.

That ...doesn't really seem like the choice you're being faced with here.  Again, you need therapy here to help you come to terms with where things are now, and what choices you actually have.  You're phrasing this like ""oh man, my husband is being unreasonable, but I really want another kid, it'd suck if I just had to divorce him, marry someone else, have an new kid, and magically have a normal family life"", but that's just...not a thing that's going to happen.

&gt; He asked me if I was stupid and how could I not see that Ryan took our lives away and there was no way in hell he was about to let Ryan steal another child’s life away.

Your husband could no doubt use some therapy too; that's not a healthy view either.  He's still closer to reality here than you are."
361,Call the police next time. 
362,"Send her a message and be sure to record it (either certified mail if it's a letter or screenshot if email/text):

""WomansName, this is the first and last time I will tell you this: stop contacting me. I have no interest in speaking to you or hearing your apologies. You are harassing me and my family, and if you are truly sorry then stop trying to tell me and SHOW me by leaving me and my family alone. Any communication from you at this point forward will be considered harassment and I will document each attempt to file a restraining order. Leave. Me. Alone.""


Her apology is about assuaging her guilt, not making you feel better. Fuck her, and if she keeps harassing you then you need to report it to police. Because this is definitely harassment."
363,That is what I have been doing ..  not reacting ... But she keeps pushing it ..  every now and then she brings up this topic and explains me everything that happened and asks me what do i think and sometimes even asks if i am willing to negotiate with her uncle ... 
364,I thought you gave very good advice 
365,"First and foremost, you DO NOT **deserve** another child. You might *want* another child,  but your entitled ass does not **deserve** another child. Children deserve happy and healthy childhoods. Adults want children. The two can exist in the same situation, but you do not **deserve* another child. Jesus Christ. 

If your husband doesn’t want another kid either cope with his decision or divorce him, but you don’t have the right to force him into another child because you don’t like he changed his mind. Your wedding vows were for better or worse; guess what, this is that “worse.” Either choose to honor your vows or leave. Both are totally reasonable choices but you neither have the right to change his mind or deserve another child. "
366,You are desperately trying to make excuses for him because you don't want to accept that he cheated on you.   Please stop doing that.  You are sabotaging yourself.  
367,Put the entire boyfriend in the bin
368,"I'd bet money they know they're in the wrong, and that's what's behind the out of character (and unreasonable) reaction. His response to you is *very* telling; you never called him a 'piece of shit', so that had to come from him. He know's they're wrong, but for whatever reason (perhaps the disagreement between him and his wife?), has decided to blame YOU for ""making a problem"". 

My next suggestion may at first strike you as petty, and maybe even childish, but hear me out. How is the relationship with your wife's parents? Are they in the picture/normal human beings? If so, I'd bring them in to the conversation, especially since BiL has decided to try to cut you and your wife out of the conversation without having truly responded. He says he won't speak to you, and is essentially telling his sister that its up to her to fix their relationship, *after he's the one that destroyed it*. 

I think this is a family issue, and whoever brings this to the rest of the family is going to get to 'set the tone' of the situation, and control the narrative. Either he goes to your inlaws and says ""I asked Op about a name and they screamed at me for being a horrible human being, i dont know what their problem is"", or you tell your inlaws the real story and you try to come to some kind of understanding. 

If your relationship with her parents/rest of the family is a good one, this is more about reaching out with help mediating what is obviously (and rightfully) an emotionally fraught situation. Not only is your wife and BiL their children, but this concerns their grand children as well. They should be able to understand the emotions and personalities involved, so all parties can feel heard while still coming to a solution. After all, no one would have more experience than the parents with mediating between a brother and sister.  They can understand where all parties are comming from, and care about the wellbeing of all parties, so hopefully they could help find a way through this without causing further harm to anyone. 

Of course, if they have a history of favouritism, or if they're generally just not the helpful sort in this kind of thing, your only solution is to distance yourself from BiL. Your wife's interpretation is correct, he obviously cares more about his own situation than anything, and has decided to commandeer your deceased child's memory regardless of consequences. 

For his future child's sake, I sincerely hope Karma isn't real."
369,"Trust me, you don’t want to know any stories they may have. PPD is ugly enough. PPP is a horror story come to life. "
370,"This. So much. Pumping and nursing (or trying to) was slowly killing me and a huge contribution to my ppd. I did not feel that connection I was supposed to feel. When someone I trust very much (personally and professionally) helped me give myself permission to stop breastfeeding, things began to improve drastically and I was finally more open to taking an anti depressant.

Your baby has gotten so much from being breastfed. It’s fantastic and beautiful your wife provides this. It’s also ok to switch to formula. For any reason or no reason at all. 

Just my 2c

I see you’ve taken quick action for your wife and your family. Nice job."
371,Just about or they are married to someone that allows them to afford a nicer housing. Denver's housing market is intense there's tons of foreclosures and the prices are through the roof.
372,"Considering you want to stay friends, your best bet is just to be direct with her about the aspect of her behavior that’s bothering you. Either she’ll work on changing, and you guys can move forward, or she won’t be able to/won’t want to, and you’ll be able to decide whether the pros of your friendship outweigh this con enough for you to overlook it or get over it.

So how do you be direct about it? Well, there’s a few options:

- Casual: Next time she launches into a story about drama that is incredibly similar to past drama she’s been involved in, point it out light-heartedly. So, for example, if she opens with “oh my god I have so much drama to fill you in on” you reply “when do you not haha” or “dude you gotta start looking for friends in different places” or “girl how does this ALWAYS happen to you” or whatever. This is a good option if she’s willing to joke about herself/not super sensitive, because she’ll likely respond with an equally light-hearted defense of herself (ex. “it’s like I just attract the wrong crowd!”) and you can easily counter with a small remark about her needing to change her behavior somehow if that’s the case (ex. “Well if it’s a pattern then maybe you have to start changing who you hang out with/how your respond”) without launching into a big discussion about her behavior or putting her on the defensive. If you keep doing this regularly it’ll likely lead to a) her becoming more conscious of her behavior, b) her doubledowning on her behavior c) her telling you a bit less of her drama and/or d) her expressing she’s annoyed at you pointing it out, which opens the door for you to discuss her behavior seriously.
- Blunt/tough love: Next time she asks for advice on a problem she’s had many times before, or rants about a dramatic incident that’s pretty much the same as her past drama, don’t engage. For example, she says “what should i do?” you simply reply “I don’t know.” She tells a long-winded dramatic story, you don’t validate her throughout it. If she keeps pressing for a response, state flatly that you are having a hard time being supportive because you feel like you keep having the same conversation with her. She says “no but seriously, what advice would you give me” you say “I don’t know what advice I could give you except the advice I give you every time this happens. I feel like we’ve talked about this so many times before.” She says “I can’t believe [insert shitty bf of the month] would do [insert shitty thing]” you say “I can. It seems like he’s really similar to the other guys you’ve dated.” Benefits of this approach are that it might be the wake-up call she needs to realize that her non-stop drama is tedious, and it will also help you feel less drained because you’re not dedicating so much emotional/mental energy to helping someone who doesn’t want help.
- Serious: Just straight up send her a message or sit her down and explain that you’re finding her non-stop drama really hard to keep up with. Centre the conversation around your emotional needs in the friendship, not her behavior in life. For example, you could say sometjing along the lines of “I really value our friendship, but lately I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed when we hang out. It feels like almost every time we get together we wind up discussing some serious drama in your life. I love you and want to be there for you when you’re going through hard times, but sometimes I’m just emotionally fried and want a purely light-hearted hang out where we can focus on enjoying each other’s company. I really appreciate that you trust me enough to come to me for advice and support, but our friendship is built on so much more than that dynamic. Lately I’ve felt like we haven’t had time for all these other aspects of our friendship that I really cherish because we’re placing so much emphasis on venting/advice. I hope you understand where I’m coming from. I miss us. Do you think we could try to discuss drama a little less?”

I definitely think it’s possible for you to talk to her about this without it ruining your friendship. I have had a few friends who have fell into similar patterns of behavior, and I have managed to talk to them about it and remain friends. That said, if she doesn’t try to change, it’s okay to recognize that you’ve simply grown apart as friends and could use some more social distance going forward, be it less frequent hangouts or even letting go of the friendship altogether.

And as a final note, here are a few things to definitely avoid saying if/when you talk to her about this:
- You do x too much
- You aren’t trying to change
- You/I always do x
- You/I never do x
- It feels like you do/think/believe x
- You’re too negative

Remember to approach it as you and her versus the problem in your friendship right now, rather than you versus her being the problem! Hope this helps."
373,"Pay the $35 and keep the bra and consider it a good life lesson. Never borrow other people's stuff.

In a seperate note why would you continue to use the term ""friend"" when it comes to this person? This is absolutely not the behavior of a true friend and this is a real opportunity to remove a toxic person from your life."
374,"That sounds horrifying. I am so sorry you went through that. If I may ask, did you get treatment, and what did the treatment entail?"
375,"You’re choosing your partners based on how attractive you think you are to them?

In other words you are prioritising men’s feelings over yours *even before you start dating them.* This is how women end up in shitty relationships. 

Your whole comment reeks of you objectifying yourself and trying to see yourself through the eyes of some crude basic guy who thinks of women as tits and ass, and lo and behold you’ve attracted some crude basic guy who doesn’t respect you and describes you in terms of tits and ass.

Get rid of him. And get some self respect. Start thinking a lot more about who you’re attracted to and what you want in a partner, and a lot less about who’s attracted to you and what they might want. Think of yourself as a person and not as a collection of body parts and you might find a man who thinks of you the same way."
376,"To me, the lying about parental permission would be the crossed line that means Tracy is no longer allowed to see your daughter, until she apologizes and understands that you are the one who has the final say regarding your daughter's life. If James can't respect this either, then sadly his privileges are also forfeit. Because who knows what boundary will be crossed next? You have to protect your daughter. "
377,"My ex quit her job without telling me, stopped her medicine without telling me or consulting a doctor, etc.

Run!"
378,I think this is a fantastic compromise if she cares that deeply about the ring. Maybe she’ll come around after you have two for a while. 
379,"Stay away from her. Block her out. Bury her in your heart and mind. It’s the only way. Don’t let her suck you back in. I know it is going to be hard in some ways because that’s your mom, and you want her to get well— but she will if she wants to. I know it sounds cold, but I could’ve wrote this story myself.. so I know exactly where you’re coming from and you’re so much stronger than you think. Just look at you, you got your life together! You didn’t fall into the same pattern as your mom! Im so fucking proud of you! "
380,"If he's religious enough to use this terminology (which is very outdated and biblical), he may also be religious enough to consider looking with desire on a married woman as adultery (one example offered in the bible). I would be inclined to ask him about it and keep an open mind."
381,"My ex used to get mad that our dog liked me more than him. But he would crate him as punishment, not take him outside when he needed to wee and then yell at him for peeing on the floor, wouldn't walk him (if I managed to bully him into coming with us he would cut the walk short) and wouldn't play with him. 
We moved in with his parents for a bit and the dog started loving his dad who would take him on 2 hour walks every day. 
They need affection. Your sister is being ridiculous if she can't see why it's happening"
382,If it stopped at “your jeans are too tight” and included other things like “you need to dress more modest” I’d be less concerned. This other stuff is weird. She should definitely trust her gut. 
383,"If his threats against you were in emails, texts, etc., give them to your ex-stepmom's lawyer."
384,"Also. Is he trynna pay for these laser treatments he wants you to get? They’re his concern so they should be his financial responsibility if you ever even considered it.  get the laser treatments , have him pay, then dump him lol 🤭😌"
385,"My heart hurt at the description of what you had to see.

Go to a lawyer, have them compose a ""stay away from our client"" letter and have it sent to her. She does not deserve to hear from you directly. "
386,"&gt;Am I being overbearing? 

Invalid question.  The valid question is: are you happy in this relationship?  Is it meeting your needs?

&gt; Is this typical of Japanese guys?

Who cares?  You aren't dating an amalgamation of the average tendencies of Japanese men.  You're dating one guy.  Either decide that you're ok with the way he treats you, or decide to dump him.

No, you can't change him.  You can't change other people."
387,"Honestly, social media is killing relationships. It's like throwing it in each other's face. ""Watch me like all these hot girls' pictures"" honestly, why? I use these insta to follow my friends, and a few actual celebrities that would never interact with me.
I'd be uncomfortable if it was my boyfriend. Hes watched daily streams for how long and never once said anything? And he's chatting with her? He probably gives money to her too and I'd want to know about that. 
I'd bring it up lightly and judge him on his reaction. If he's got a crush or ""whatever"" it's impacting your self esteem and self worth to the relationship. And since there's no real ""reason"" for him to be chatting with her I think it would be fine to ask him to stop, especially if he pays her.
"
388,"I would tell him that it's far too soon in the relationship for him to be asking such a huge favor.

11 hours one-way = 22 hours round trip.  That's a LOT of wear and tear on your car.  

If he gets into an accident, there will almost certainly be insurance issues. Does your insurance policy cover you letting someone else drive your car?  Call your agent and ask, if you're not sure.

Sure - it's better for HIM to take your car.  But it is not better for YOU.   

In short, it's a bad idea."
389,"That one actually wasn't unreasonable because OP really buried the lede and mentioned way down in the comments that she was Chinese (I think) and apparently brides in her culture wear red wedding dresses. So she wanted the validation of a bunch of internet strangers telling her that her cousin was a jealous bridezilla, when really she was knowingly wearing a dress that looked like a wedding dress."
390,"It is the duty of a grown ass human to reject a teenager even if he or she comes onto them, because it's inappropriate (and in most states illegal) to be in a romantic/sexual relationship with them."
391,"One of things looks sexy on her, one does not. 

I'm not surprised which one he offered to pay for."
392,"I experienced the same type of thing. As soon as my parents got divorced and my father moved away, all the repressed memories started to flood back. I was 19 at the time.

OP, move away and go no contact for a while. If you are repressing something, it won't surface until you are 'safe'. But be prepared - get in therapy and have a good support system, cause if there is anything there, you're really going to need it."
393,"I know this is overwhelming. I'm so sorry this is happening to you at this vulnerable time in your life. 

Please please consult with a lawyer regarding your finances/potential custody issues. At the very least, getting a menu of options will help you think through next steps. 

Relatedly, you may want to look into advocacy groups for women in the Denver area. Even if you don't need to stay in a shelter, they should have resources to help support you and figure out what you can do next. 

Lean heavily on whatever friends and family you have right now. I know you said you don't have parents to count on, but there must be someone. You don't have to do this alone. "
394,"I'm sorry but I just don't agree with you. A dad saying to his teenage daughter ""your legs look good while running' is NOT  appropriate. Especially given his background and combined with the other things he says and does. Normalising inappropriate behaviour like this is part of the problem and how grooming happens. He is an adult. He is old enough to know what is appropriate and what isn't.  "
395,"Nope. He is deliberately, intentionally testing your boundaries and seeing how much abuse you will tolerate.

Get out now, this only gets worse."
396,"I think this is good advice. She isn't really being fair to you, but it is coming from an understandable place of grief. The focus needs to be on how to get both of your needs met. She can't expect your father to not be involved, and she will be missing her father at the wedding no matter what, so how can she honor him while also allowing you to have the wedding you deserve?"
397,"To be honest, I think he knows it isn't the morally right thing to do which is why he's pre-empting it with anger. As long as he can remain angry and act like OP is the one doing something wrong he can avoid the guilt from knowing he's being a shitty person.

You're right, the best thing to do is to let it lie, especially since I think the implication here is that his SIL isn't even pregnant yet. Anyone rational will understand the explanation of ""they're using the name of the child we miscarried for their kid despite knowing how much it would hurt us""."
398,"I think that following attractive people, or having a celebrity crush is pretty harmless. If you and your husband have a healthy conversation and joke about yours, that's when I feel it's normal. It would be weird to be restrictive when it comes to celebrity crushes because they are supposed to be silly and in the absolute realm of unattainable. Passively viewing someone's content, when literally everyone on earth seems to posts social media content is okay.

Full disclaimer, I'm not on Twitch so I have no idea how it works. I think though that him messaging her, especially with her having a small following, is starting to toe the line. It's not a celebrity crush, he is trying to interact with an actual woman. How much of her content is her just being in character? Is he a HUGE fan of the character or something? It's not something that he knows will get lost in a sea of admiring comments on a picture, he's trying to connect in a more real time. He's watching her streams all the time. Is it because she posts entertaining quality content, or is her fan base a bit more male gazing in love fanboy dudes?

I think that you have to decide if it's a harmless celebrity crush or if he's actually using her as an everyday escape, more similar to an infatuation. There's a difference between the two, and I think you know that. Yes, she's probably unattainable and probably not interested in your husband but is he actively trying to connect and pursue her? Probably not a healthy behavior. "
399,"""To get into a legitimate law school, you need a GPA of X, LSAT scores of Y, skills in public speaking, good memory, etc...

403,I read your last sentence in regards to the guy being a disease. I'm gonna stick with it cause I find it amusing.
404,"I can't think of a scenario where this goes perfectly, and that really sucks, but I agree with you that it is the right decision. 

Do you know who the core of her support system is (outside you of course)? If so, I would have a discussion with your gf. Tell her you have been hiding an addiction from her, and you are seeking help, but don't know if you have the control/coping mechanisms to not hurt her. And not hurting her is your a priority to you. Tell her that you need to end things because you really need to focus on healing yourself right now and she doesn't deserve what you could potentially put her through. I think I would try to avoid details if you are able to? That way she doesn't have your specific words to rattle in her head. But if she asks, be honest. That's a double edge sword, I know. And then in regards to her support system  - email/text them directly after this conversation. ""I just broke up with X. I'm concerned about her mental health, and I know I'm the bad guy right now, but she needs a good support system."""
405,"My husband has an irresistibly delicious natural sweat smell. 

Not like, BO unwashed ass stank, but just after being outside on a hot day? I’ll make him blush by trying to smell his armpits so much 😂 I swear I’m not a weirdo, it’s the genetic compatibility - his phenomenon are like a drug to me. Better than any cologne on earth. 😍

(We have a beautiful little almost-2 year old, so thanks, Mother Nature!)"
406,"So your husband set up your dad to embarrass him and hurt your mother, just to prove he’s right. What else was there to gain but trouble on all ends. At best, he’s a smug idiot, and at worst he’s a big jerk. 

If it bothers you because of your moms feelings, keep in mind this was all your husband’s doing and you need to talk to him about it."
407,"I'm sorry, but I think your husband has a lot of carefully thought out points, and I agree with him.  It seems like the system you have worked out between you to deal with your situation is already strained.  It would be very unwise, not to mention irresponsible, to add more stress into the system.  It's understandable that you're heartbroken about the hand that life has dealt you, and it's unfair, but you should probably focus on accepting that this is the way it is."
408,"At an org I used to work at our highest earner was a guy who had left law school to care for his mum when she got cancer.

Instead of going back to law school he trained as a debt and welfare advisor and was so good at it he brought in about 40% of our legal aid in the organisation single handedly. 

He admitted he'd have never been as good at being a lawyer as he ended up in this role even if the path of finding that out was very painful and unplanned. The clients loved him and had their lives changed by him even if we found his filing system a royal pain in the arse."
409,"She can't force you to do anything. You're broken up. Block her and move on, have nothing to do with her again.

And you didn't ""mess up."" She snooped on you phone. "
410, I’ve always been careful about that. But I’m going to be extra careful now .
411,"I don't understand all the top level comments basically asking OP if she's a snob who provokes the treatment her boyfriend gave her on the phone or coaching her on how to come home from her extremely stressful job taking care of people just to pick up the ball dropped by her boyfriend's family and society in order to TEACH HIM HOW TO DISPLAY BASIC EMPATHY FOR THE WOMAN HE OSTENSIBLY LOVES.

There is no such thing as a healthy, functional adult relationship wherein a twenty-eight year old man tells his girlfriend that everyone has problems (so apparently hers don't exist?) and swearing in exasperation when she honestly answers his question as to what's up.

If he doesn't want to listen to anything difficult he should date someone with no difficulties in their life, like himself.

It is not a lot to ask for your partner to acknowledge your reality and to respect and love you. That's like ""sign your name on the test"" level shit, if you can't pass that step, what the FUCK are you doing in a relationship?"
412,"At the moment I'm sitting in my car talking to a friend about something else. My brother passed away last week and I've got to arrange my notes for his service, which doesn't help at all. I was also freaked baptised last week (I'm agnostic) because we're getting married in a church. I was incredibly uncomfortable with it and was grilled to death by the priest(?) ... Ugh. 

I don't believe that she's been unfaithful to the degree of having some sort of physical interaction, but I had a suspicion about an event she went to in Vegas a few months ago. When she came back she told me about how she had really genuine, deep conversations with some guy(s) and it was so amazing. We have different fields and different interests, so she said she got to talk about all of that stuff with this/these people. 

She is leaving for the night (apparently). She doesn't want to go to her parents because ""it will blow up and she doesn't want to stress them out"". I think she doesn't want her mom to lay into her personally. "
413,"Yeah, ask the employer who offered you the job with good pay! I understand that if you start looking like pregnant and with your refusal of the offer at first place it would be difficult but worth giving a try!! But so what if you need maternity leave in few months or later... You can assure your employer to be that you will be back and definitely would add the value to organization... You can may be try explaining your situation that how much you love St Louis and therefore you are applying again with full sincerity.
I don't know what to say about your husband.. Yes he ruined it but I think both of you should actually write down numbers... Take 2 sheets of paper, for both the situation put down all the positive and negative cash flows (for everything- like even the one where you don't have any support for yourself and baby while you are pregnant that how much money is it worth it and put it in negative cashflow for the scenario where you dont get any support). 
Like that when you sum up.. you will just be able to tell your husband in numbers which situation is worse.. both of you can then make a decision which will be optimal and won't involve emotions as in either of you hating each other... So in this para I intended to say that numbers or logic don't lie and are a great way of communicating without any emotional drama between 2 parties. 
Similarly when you are taking a decision whether to stay or go back... don't do it out of your weakness or when you are emotional, just write down sort of a cashflow but considering intangible pros or cons as well.. you will be at least bit more confident...
Wish you luck..."
414,"wow. Any stories you would like to share about your experiences? I'm confused as to what postpartum psychosis is exactly, so I wish to know."
415,"&gt;someone like Tracy

What does that even mean? She sounds like a perfectly pleasant woman. I think OP is just hurt at the new relationship and is trying to find reasons to be upset with her."
416,"Hi I'm a computer engineer and you're being an idiot.

Unless you want a career in software, taking a software job is the worst choice that you can make for your future. Your bf has also said that he might dump you if you stay...for a supposed ""smart"" woman you are being very dumb. 

If he is not willing to move for you, ever, then he is not ""the one""..duh."
417,I don't know you but I feel proud of how you handled this entire nightmare.  
418,So where is her love for you in these conversations? She is not holding up her end of the partnership if you come away from every conversation feeling like a jerk. Your happiness is just as important as hers and she is not being very tender with your feelings while you are doing everything you can to nurture hers.
419,"This. Holy fuck, this. "
420,"&gt;  they have probably tried and she is too desperate to see facts.

They bought her an LSAT tutor for Christmas despite her being utterly rejected. 

They want OP to be the bad guy here, and it's completely inappropriate."
421,"OP when you get things halfway situated with your wife, I really hope you can find a good therapist. Maybe you can vent some of this stuff. You’ve had a lot to hold onto this last year. Good luck :)"
422,"Situation is savable if husband agrees to go to couples counseling. She should make sure she gets individual counseling, too, to support her. Not all meds are bad during pregnancy, some are worth the risk, Zoloft is pretty safe and so are some thyroid meds, or mild stimulants with lots of counseling. She should definitely talk to her doctors. Moving home until the baby is born is also probably a good idea if her family is   amenable."
423,"Yeah, I think the ""not sure what your arrangement is"" thing is good to add. She could know about this and be okay with it and saying that softens your message/makes it less awkward if that's the case. But it is really weird and scummy for him to be creating a whole fake ""widower"" identity if it's an ethical open relationship. I bet he is lying to her. Even if he's not, I hope you flagging this for her will at least clue them in that it's a flimsy, bad lie."
424,"I think you need to call off the wedding. She has to get her stuff under control, and it’s not your job to do that. As it is, this would most definitely not be a healthy relationship. "
425,"Seriously, the difference between 16 and 25 is huge. He's either a 16 yo or a pedo lol"
426,"Hang in there OP. You’re doing great man. Keep us updated? I know Reddit is probably the last of your worries but I wanna know you’re doing alright! You’ve got this, good luck to you and your family."
427,"I think her behavior of leaving you on your own in most previous social situations--and her insistence of inviting others--should have been a big hint that she wouldn't be reliable on this evening.

Either way, my point is that you messed up here by relying on her as strongly as you did, and I'm not sure you're seeing that because most of your replies keep going over how you wished she would have behaved. That's not something you can control, and yeah you guys are going to have to figure out your relationship, but you could have better controlled your response to her behavior and had a better night than what you ended up with. That was an option, but you didn't choose it and now you're trying to pin all of the blame on her by saying that she ""totally screwed you."""
428,"Under no circumstances get married to this woman.Please make sure that your finances are separate and that the house is in your name.She needed you when she had no job,now she is earning she is showing her contempt for you.A lifetime of misery is ahead of you if you marry her."
429,"She probably doesn't want you involved. James isn't your daughter's father. He's just a guy you dated. But you keep sending your daughter over to his house, and Tracy is just trying to make the best of it. 

She's being the bigger person here while you're looking for ulterior motives and trying to justify hating her.

I think it'd be in all of your best interests if you simply moved on and stopped pining for the man you broke up with. It'll hurt in the short-term, but you'll all get over it."
430,"There's no good solution. Side with your wife and from the sound of it you'll be betraying your own values, because they sound demanding and entitled and you don't agree with their attitude. You'll likely upset your MIL's brother too, if that's a factor. Stand your ground and don't side with them and she'll likely get mad at you which might damage your relationship, equally all being well she'll get over it.

You're not being insensitive for not taking her side by default if you don't agree with her attitude. If you're feeling brave you can flat out tell her that her uncle has been **very** generous buying the house, and it's unreasonable to expect or demand even more generosity from him - he's done enough, and they're entitled to nothing, so should be grateful for what he's provided to this point rather than complaining it's not even more. How she'll react to that opinion only you can answer."
431,You actually might save her life. Scott Peterson (in CA) was claiming to his girlfriend that he was widdower and his wife had died .. before he killed her. 
432,"If you stay you’ll be posting a similar post in 6 months, a year, two years, so on. He won’t change. Run while it’s early and easier than after several years of cheating and gaslighting that this is all your fault he is a cheating pos. "
433,"OP does not owe this girl closure. Good that she feels remorse, maybe next time it will serve as a wonderful reminder not to fuck her friend's boyfriend."
434,Her fear of sex is not just going to disappear once she gets married. 
435,"As someone who worked in jewellery when this style was popular with exactly the demographic you've described yourself as, as wedding and other 'permanent' ring styles: thank you for providing closure to early 20s me, who always wondered if these people would double down on loving the ring or grow to feel embarrassed by it.

You could just be honest with her. Sit down, eat crow, admit how you feel, and that you want your ring to be something that fills you with pride and love, not shame and cringe. She will understandably be upset, but hopefully will come to understand your perspective. Depending upon the materials from which your original ring was made, you may be able to have a new ring made incorporating parts of the original. Also, from a professional view, you could argue that the fashion style you chose was not designed to stand up to the wear and tear wedding rings receive, and you'd like something more durable (like your relationship). Sounds like you may have tried this approach.

Now, has the 10th wedding anniversary been and gone? If yes, skip ahead. If no, your mission is to make getting new rings made for the anniversary seem like the best idea ever. Talk up the romantic angle, talk up the sentimental angle, talk up the 'reflection of our growth, as husband and wife', and how your only regret about marrying young was not being able to afford the ring *she* deserved. Suggest matching rings, even.

If the anniversary has passed, you're going to have to 'lose' the ring. And you're going to have to wait to do it. Can't do it on the back of this issue. She'll suspect your duplicity. Alternatively, you could just lose your entire left hand AND ring in a horrible boating accident. I kid. You're going to have to go with plan A: an open and frank yet empathetic and supportive conversation about your feelings."
436,"Hi OP. I work in a major medical center emergency department that has an intensive emergency psychiatric area— we treat postpartum mothers regularly. 

I am afraid I am a little concerned at your post. What you described at first sounded like a very severe case of PPD... but once you got into the paranoid delusions, I have a new concern:

Postpartum psychosis. 

Postpartum psychosis is rare but it is incredibly serious and can absolutely come as a result of a traumatic pregnancy or birth... it can even happen with a perfect pregnancy or delivery. This is something that needs to be treated NOW, not later, or else she can become a threat to herself or even the baby (especially if she has resentment for the child). 

Please take her to the ER. She needs crisis evaluation. "
437,"I think I'm with you on this.

I remember being 18 and having a crush on a coworker who was probably nearing 30 at the time.  We had fun flirting etc, until the day he learned I was 18. He immediately transitioned our interactions so we were still friendly but there was no flirting and he made it clear there would be no more flirting because it wasn't appropriate.

I mean, I was a legal adult and I still think that was an appropriate reaction because I was a flipping teenager and he was a fully-established adult.  There is no reality in which I, as a teenager barely in college, was mature enough to handle a relationship with a 30 year old man, and he recognized it and made sure he didn't take advantage of me.  That would have been some insane power imbalance, and as an adult he recognized it when I couldn't.  I didn't like it at the time, but over a decade later I recognize and appreciate that he respected me enough to not take advantage of my immaturity.

A 25+ year old man dating a girl (and yeah, she was still a girl) of 16 is totally inappropriate and I would question his judgement if he doesn't recognize that, especially now that he's even older looking back at it.  If he can't look back and see that the age difference was totally inappropriate, I'd seriously doubt his maturity and judgement."
438,This is exactly it. Thank you so much for understanding 
439,"Look into legal aid and pro bono services in your area. If there is a law school in your area, they might have something. You can also call your local bar society. 
You might not qualify for these services based on how much you make (everywhere has different rules) but they can give you a better idea of what is available in your area. "
440,"In a non-sexy moment, ask to talk to your wife about this.  Ask her why this made her so upset.  It's not unreasonable to want her to initiate more frequently, but long term couples often get comfortable with a sex ""script"" so it's possible that she just is used to things progressing one way and thrown off when it doesn't go like that.  If she can't explain or inherently thinks that ""the woman shouldn't have to"" that's a problem since it's really unfair to you to not even try to meet you halfway on this.  Making a move is not some groundbreaking difficult task, it's simple, like kissing or touching first.  If you do have expectations that go beyond that, be specific about it so you can try to feel out what kind of ""script"" would meet both of your needs."
441,Given that he's been cheating I don't think anyone would hold it against you for breaking up over the phone or internet.
442,"I think both of them need to recognize that they're acting immature. OP clearly has a stressful job -- much moreso than the BF. But ""Uniquely stressful?"" No, not remotely true. Stress isn't a contest, and listening graciously should be in relatively unending supply. Until you're mature enough to know that and enact it, you're going to run into tiffs like this"
443,"This guy sounds kind of selfish. He doesn't go down on you, but you do it for 40 minutes? HELLO - THIS IS WHY SEX IS PAINFUL! I almost have to have that kind of stimulation to be receptive to sex."
444,"&gt; I haven't had a conversation comparing our jobs yet

Don't. There's no way to do this without being a jerk. And there's not really anything productive that can come from his feeling less than you, based on your roles. "
445,"you dumped him. it is **entirely arbitrary** what reason you give - the end result is the same: he can't have a romantic relationship with you anymore.

also, you don't get to use an ex as emotional support. you don't get to use them for anything beyond what they decide is appropriate, and healthy for them, which typically is nothing at all

the ego on some people..."
446,I personally wouldn't stay with someone who thought it was appropriate to exploit a teenager.
447,"&gt;He just isn't ready to propose at this time, even though I would totally accept.

The fact that you would accept a proposal at *seven months* shows that you’re really not mature enough to think about marriage."
448,"I work for DCS as a CPS worker in my state (3 years in the field as of yesterday). The information I give you is solely based on my experience as a case manager and how my state (Indiana) operates. 

We are unable to give report source information to anyone who isn’t the report source. You can say you want to remain anonymous. However, depending on the information they give to to family about the report, they may realize its you, or yell at everyone they come into contact regularly that they know they’re the ones who have called it in. I’ve had report sources call me and say “I’m going to sue you for giving out my info. They told me you told them.” Well; I didn’t and they’re just trying to get you to admit you did. I ALWAYS suggest playing dumb when someone confronts you. This is probably not their first CPS rodeo. Just deny deny deny. If he gets physical or threatens you, call law enforcement immediately. 

As far as telling the family the kids will be taken away is hit or miss. I try not to make that threat unless the parents are being idiots and not complying and there is a possibility the children could be taken. Some workers throw it out there like water because of power. They may or may not have said that and the family could be lying. I’ve also had people say I threatened to remove their kids when I never did. 

Now, about the incident/your report. You 100% did the right thing. Emotional abuse is abuse. Yelling and screaming at a child, making them feel worthless, is just like physical abuse, but it WAY harder to prove. For myself, I would prefer to investigate a hard to prove report rather than something possibly happening. Even if CPS doesn’t do anything, there is now a record, which can establish a pattern.

As far as him living in the apartment, you should check with the landlord about policies of people living in the complex. If he was in jail for an extended amount of time he **probably** (maybe not) has a felony. Most complexes will not let you live on the property if you have a felony, so he is most likely there illegally (also worked in apartments in leasing for years, kind of a jack of all trades, master of none). I would bring that up. 

I would honestly maybe look for a new place to live after the lease is up as this won’t get any better. It is highly unlikely the report would be substantiated against the guy unless the children disclose, but they are probably so afraid of this guy they won’t. 

I want to assure you what you did was right. Children grow up to have a lot of emotional/behavioral issues when raised in this kind of home. Mom needs to get away from him, quick, and hope paternity has not been established. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. Again, this is based on my experiences in my state, solely. "
449,"he doesn’t want you to be thin or healthy, he wants you feeling bad about yourself. time to take the trash out."

451,"I think that passive asking is probably a thing, but its not what you are doing in the cases you've mentioned, in the way you have described it. 

I think you have a big problem here. I doubt that his friends reaction to him buying you a sports bra has come out of the blue, but that this is part of a longer conversation they have been having in the background. Otherwise, his comment doesn't make sense and is a huge over reaction. So it seems this is really weighing on your husbands mind a lot.

I think there are at least three possibilities of what is going on here. 

1. Your husband is alarmed that your financial mismanagement means that you live pay check to pay check. Instead of dealing with that in a sensible fashion by talking out his feelings with you, he's become hypersensitive to your spending and defensive of his own money. This looms so large as an issue in his mind that he sees things in your behaviour that aren't there - such as the so called 'passive asking'. 
2. A darker possibility is that your husband quite enjoys the fact that you have less money then he does and uses it to exert control over you. Such as buying you something you didn't ask him to buy and then complaining about that later in order to make you feel/look bad. That is potentially emotionally abusive behaviour. 
3. It's unclear exactly who pays for what in your relationship. Are you meeting living costs 50/50 or do you pay proportionally, or does he pay for pretty much everything and your pay check is your 'fun' money? Is it possible that your husband feels that you've pushed him to live a high cost lifestyle that he didn't really want because he earns more then you? Perhaps he feels resentful of that and is lashing out in silly ways?

It seems to me that whatever is behind this behaviour, the two of you need to have a good talk about your financial situation and what is going to happen in the future. "
452,"Second this, 
I think most women would prefer partners without baggage. (Not to be insulting) but it’s easier if somebody else’s life isn’t already existent and tangled. 
Life would be easier for a single woman like Tracy to partner to a single man like James. Tracy sounds to me like she’s going above and beyond trying to be nice and accommodating for James desire to stay in touch with the child that isn’t even his?!

It’s difficult to be a single person and take on somebody else’s biological children that aren’t yours, and have the rubbish of a moody ex, though that person would have to accept their partner has children and is unfortunately tied to the moody ex. 

Tracy could very easily give James the “why are you spending so much time with your ex and a child that’s not even your child!!” And give him an ultimatum to cut the ties with moody ex. 
"
453,"Personally, I think it's time to be direct. It's creepy and strange that they are pushing this 20-year-older twice-married man at you, especially when they know damn well that you're in a relationship.

Next time it comes up, be blunt. ""I'm sorry if I've given you any other impression, but I'm not interested in Noah. I'm very happy with my boyfriend, and I don't have the time to take on new friendships right now, either. Now, can I get your recipe for the bean salad? It's fantastic!""

I just don't understand their reasoning (in terms of what's best for you.) Even if you were single, this is a completely inappropriate match for you. He's in the middle of separating from wife number two, FFS!"
454,"I think 3 months is not a lot of time to know someone well. Just remember that maybe basing your relationships and marriages on butterflies and not personality traits is not a good idea. That said, I'm pretty unemotional anyway so I wouldn't see a problem with that relationship."
455,his fbi agent loves him! friends hate him! check out #6 to see why
456,"Your husband, who is supposed to be your partner in sickness and in health, wouldn't pay your copay to get a life-saving shot (is he aware of how tetanus progresses?) I've donated more than that to a complete stranger's medical GoFundMe. Your husband sucks. 

You could try counseling but for that to work, he'd have to admit that there's a problem. Be prepared to cut your losses and leave. "
457,"&gt; The years that followed have been a cespool of resentment towards me and our child

&gt; I am ""allowed"" to go out with my friends once per year

&gt; Other than going to work, I'm not allowed out of the house

&gt;  If I make any sort of suggestion or disagree with her in any way, it's ""OK Mr President! Sir!"" She has never congratulated me nor expressed anything but negative emotions towards [my promotion which makes my wife's life possible]

&gt; I confided in her that I'm so miserable that I've contemplated and fantasied about suicide. Hey reaction was anger, and that I'm being a baby. Zero concern. Zero self awareness.

I think your wife deserves a promotion also... to singlehood!

Your wife isn't what she once was.  Her envy has taken over every fiber of her being, turning her into a horrible, ungrateful, and psychologically violent fiend.

None of this is your fault; it is entirely hers.  Take the usual preparations to divorce, and put a stake through her.  Do it now before her wicked ways seep into your wonderful child.

&gt; I put family before my job always. 

Soon you won't have to worry about your family or your job: either your wife will serve you divorce papers first (she's way more miserable with your marriage than you are) or your horrible wife will cause your career to implode and you'll lose that too."
458,"Your dad is an ass. And a liar. 

Will some men do this? Yes. Will *all* men? Absolutely not. 
"
459,"Not exclusively, she also pumps and feeds her from those bottles. We've introduced formula recently too to help give my wife more of a break from pumping and nursing. I left both formula and some bottles of breastmilk with her friend along with the baby's typical feeding schedule."
460,"Because he wants you uncertain and insecure. He doesn't actually want you to succeed, because that would empower you and make you feel good. He just wants you to spend all your energy trying to please him, while he denies you that praise and keeps you off balance. That's why he criticizes you for how you look, then also mocks you for trying to fix it. 

Look, a 30 year old who isn't a creep with issues would never, ever want to date a 19 year old. They might think a 19 year old is attractive, they might do an FWB thing, but they would never want to actually *date* them, because a 19 year old isn't in the stage of life to be a good, equal partner to someone that much older.

It doesn't matter if he's nice other times, he's an ass over other things. You should find someone closer to your age who will be nice ALL the time. My fiance and I don't agree on everything, but we have never acted like your boyfriend towards each other. "
461,"I think what we all WANT to say is- dump him. Anyone who wants you to make purely aesthetic changes must have feelings for you that are only skin deep.

Obviously thats not an easy answer and its complicated with feelings, but bottom line is he’s way off base and you have every right to a) be done with him or at the least b) be very pissed off."
462,"&gt; I'm considering cutting them all out at this point. I don't know if my  emotions are clouding my judgement or if this is reasonable 

Completely reasonable. The bf especially needs to be dumped post-haste.

&amp;#x200B;"
463,"I think this girl needs counselling, she's starting to close every door of socialisation and now even her boyfriend can't get to her. I would be really worried indeed if I were you. This is much more than destroying your relationship, she could be destroying herself.

Could you reach out to her direct family to ask them to encourage her too? Or any friends she used to hangout with a lot?"
464,"Exactly this. I read OPs post, and it seems like all Tracy is doing is trying to make the daughter feel welcome and cared for. She overstepped a few times, but she's 24 and I doubt she has any experience dating someone who spends a lot of time with a small kid, so she doesn't know what is appropriate. OP acts like she's trying to steal her kid away or something.

OP is honestly coming across like she's jealous James moved on and found a nice girl to date, so she's looking for faults and nitpicking so she can be ""better"" than Tracy. Instead of being happy that her daughter goes go a place where both adults love her and treat her well, she's upset because her kid is treated well by the ""new girlfriend."""
465,He's a narcissist. I lived with one for 22 yrs. It will never change unless she leaves him. Sorry it's about your parents but it's all the hallmark examples of a narcissist 
466,You caught them having sex. He is lying.
467,"Why is there always one of these comments? Why do gross pervy fathers who actively creep on their teenage daughters have so many defenders?

Pop here isn't innocent. He has made actual remarks and has made excuses to touch her actual body and exposed her to age-inappropriate ideas about sex when she was ten or younger. None of those are involuntary fleeting thoughts out of his control; they're *actions.* Fuck off with ""he just can't help it but he's a good person really!!!"""
468,This!!! She invaded your privacy by going through your phone - you shouldn’t have had to delete or archive anything. She sounds incredibly immature and exhausting. Let her go. 
469,"I like that, its a good idea, if I notice him doing so I'll try that "
470,"lol so what would he have done if she was 15? 14? 13? at what point does the fact that a girl is still a minor undercut her being ""so mature for her age""? that kind of comment in-and-of-itself is a red flag -- it means he was aware that her age was inappropriate.

what kind of 25 year-old is compatible with a junior in high school. did they bond over algebra II homework and the weird smell on the school bus?

i'll tell you 100% why this relationship was the be-all-end-all for this dude: he could mold her to become the partner he wanted her to be, because 16 year-olds are impressionable adolescents who still haven't figured out who they are and just want to feel ""cool"" and liked. in steps a 25 year-old dude who's ""so much more mature"" than the high school guys and is a ""real adult"" and gives her the affirmation she wants. he knows ""so much more"" about the world and can ""teach her.""

the fact that he can't maintain a long-term relationship with someone his own age makes it even worse. he can't stand to be with someone who is his equal or is their own person and can challenge him. so he has to date teenage girls."
471,"Don't pick.  Tell them ""I am not choosing between my parents and my girlfriend.  I love you all, and I will not choose.  If you sever ties with your child, it will be **your** choice, not mine.  This is not, never was, and never will be on my shoulders.""  


Should they follow through and disown you, then you've done the right thing.  One day they will be gone, and if you bowed to their demands, you'll be left with nothing, not even your dignity and sense of self-worth.  Live and love your best life.  "
472,"So you want a fill-in dad, but not allow him to make any sort of parental or guardian decision? "
473,"Your husband thinks it's hilarious that your mom walked out sobbing and is embarrassed/upset?

Anyway, there's nothing for you to do besides be supportive of your mom... and not ask questions like that while you are drinking. Really, this is on your dad to fix."
474,"If money is so tight that he can't rent a car, then how exactly was he planning to pay for gas/food/lodging for the 22+ hours on the road?  

Renting a small, fuel-efficient car is very cheap.  So is taking a bus.

It's unfortunate the current shut down situation has put your new BF in a pickle, but one of the realities of a situation like this is having to make tough decisions.  "
475,"&gt; I have a feeling that your wife is just as entitled as her family... 

It's because she is and I truly pity OP, these people are leeches and sooner than later they will need a new victim when their golden goose gets tired of them. "
476,"You should have just let her leave when she told you that's what she wanted.  What was the point in her being there and sulking?  Yes, her behavior was bad and she should have been more supportive.  But she made it pretty clear to you from about 10 minutes in that she wasn't going to behave that way.  At that point you could have told her to leave and you could have spent the rest of the party mingling and socializing like you wanted.  Then you could have had a conversation with her after the part about how her behavior made you feel.  Instead, you pretty much forced her to stay when she didn't want to be there and allowed it to ruin your night.  She's made it pretty clear that she doesn't feel the need to support you the way you do for her.  Don't expect that to change."
477,"I think James choosing to keep someone like Tracy around does say a lot about his character and how stable a role model he may be in 5, 10, 15 years.

The influence his partners have on OP’s daughter may only increase as she gets closer to puberty and idolizes females she aspires to be like. One might think, Ah! But it’s only an hour or two! But kids are very impressionable, especially in a single-parent household. "
478,Move on. This girl is insecure and doesn't trust you at all. You dodged a bullet when she broke up with you.
479,"&gt;Your gf is making your stress and grief about her

This is exactly right. She should be asking how she can help make this difficult time easier for you, not obstructing your ability to spend this time focused on your dog. Her jealousy and feelings about your ex have no part in this.

I'm so sorry for your loss."
480,"&gt; She does this thing where she presses her brows together, sticks out her chin, and pushes her lower lip out. It makes her look like an angry child, and I can't stand looking at her when she's doing that. She'll stomp around the house making that face, turning her head to look at me so I don't miss out on the fact that she is VERY MAD at me

&gt; I don't think she's playing it up for attention or manipulation.

Look at those two quotes and tell me how they go together? They don't. She is very clearly doing this for attention/manipulation.

I'm an easy crier too. But every time I cry I try my best to stay composed, immediately wipe my tears away and try to hide the fact that I'm crying. I also apologise for crying, and I stress that I'd like to continue this conversation and to please ignore me."
481,"Wish I had Reddit coinage to give you. One occupation I was interested in as a kid was being a garbage collector. It sounded awesome! I'd get to ride around in a truck all day, I wouldn't have to be in an office, I had a poor sense of smell, and I'd get to be outside. But I don't like cold weather and my city/province/country is basically winter for half the year, so I didn't want to enter into that field and be miserable half the time."
482,"As someone who's also in an IT job that allows me to work remotely at times, all I can say is that your boyfriend needs to work on gaining the skills he's been told are required for the career he desires. I assume he's not incapable of learning, right? Is he even trying? If finances are a concern, they shouldn't be. I assume your boyfriend is probably a programmer of some sort? If so, there are plenty of free resources online.

It seems to me that the real problem here is your boyfriend's lack of motivation and self-awareness. Or maybe he's just really bad at his chosen field. Either way, if he doesn't take action to either improve himself or find another career path, I'd say you're more than justified to throw down an ultimatum. It's not fair for you to be the only one worried about your joint future."
483,"As a woman who often cries during hard conversations... Why do you took that crying is a conversation ender? Some people get emotional when they're having discussions but that doesn't mean the discussion stops.

Expecting that one day she'll just not cry at these conversations, especially when she's going through mental illness, is very unrealistic. You have to continue on with the conversation in a calm fashion if you want to get any kind of progression. You aren't a jerk for continuing when she's crying, you're being assertive. She's not a baby that needs to be removed from a sad stimulus and soothed, she's an adult. 

If she insists that because she's crying communication should stop, that is a very telling sign, and may mean that she uses the tears as a way to get you to back down. That'll be how your relationship is for a very, very long time.

"
484,"You never need a “valid” reason to leave. 
If you feel it’s not right to stay, then that’s all you need "
485,"This is going to sound really blunt, but a person who can't muster two minutes of sympathetic noises to a sick partner who had a rough day is not going to develop empathy no matter how much explaining you do. He doesn't have any empathy for you in the first place, never mind your specific situation with work. "
486,Andrea Yates is a famous example.
487,"Sorry you are going through this. 

It does sound like you are unhappy and have hit the end of the road in your relationship. I think sexually incompatibility is very difficult to overcome, particularly if your partner isn't willing to meet you half way. 

I'm married and a mother and if I could give one piece of advice to people who are considering getting married or having children with someone or both, it would be don't get married/have children assuming that this will change the person for the better - because it won't. If you aren't happy in your relationship now, it is unlikely to get better enough to make marriage worth it. 

I understand how daunting splitting up must feel, particularly as you are tied together financially. However if you really want to go you are just going to have to bite the bullet and do it. Your choices seem to be, get on with it and get it over with or continue to languish on as you are. Both are painful in their own way, but sometimes you have to do painful things in order to be happy. 

Why not go and see a solicitor privately so that you have a plan in place about how you can go about selling the house, or at least be more informed about what your choices are. It would probably be a good idea to research alternative accommodation too so that you have a plan if you want to move out before the sale, which might be best for your mental health. 

I think you have to be really on your guard not to be suckered back in with false promises when you do split up. Whatever you do, don't get her pregnant or be lured into getting her pregnant in order to patch up your relationship because that is a disaster in the making.

488,"Yeah your husband is right here. He already works 70-80 hours a week! That's insane!! And you've admitted that despite those hours, your funds are mostly drained by your son. Your child has severe disabilities and needs lots of attention, medical care and expenses. And it's not going to get better as time goes on and you two get older. More children = more financial expenses, more stress, and yeah what happens if you two did have a second child that also had disabilities? 

You two are already stretched drastically thin with one disabled son. A second disabled child would explode the situation. Hell a second non-disabled baby would just pile on to your breaking point with normal, every day parenting.  I applaud your strength for raising a special needs child, I really do. But do not be selfish here and add more children to the mix.  

Your husband has really thought this through. He's not going to be able to work 70-80 hours a week until retirement. And it's clear he's barely hanging on here while you're ready to throw another kid into the mix because you think you deserve another child which is a terrible attitude. 

You two need to find more support for yourselves as parents.  You need to mourn the plans you originally had and accept that this is the hand in life you were dealt. It's not fair but you can make sure your lives aren't harder by adding more kids. All your husband's points are valid and you can't seem to understand that your husband is at his breaking point. "
489,"&gt; Is it more reasonable for him to be mad at me than me at him for planning to cheat with me? 

&amp;#x200B;

No, this is a classic tactic they employ to try to deflect your argument. It gives them a way to respond to you without actually answering the questions you've asked. Stay focused when they try to deflect, anything they bring up can be addressed separately later. The main point is their infidelity. Drive it home.

&amp;#x200B;"
490,"I kind of agree with this. There is no value to a conversation about vague suspicions and the downside is that if it's TRUE, she is teaching him to hide it better.

I would keep observing, personally. If it is too much of a struggle to be with him, with the potential suspicions, then I would suggest that there is fundamentally an issue with trust, whether it be warranted on his end or not. "
491,Gaslighting is when you convince someone they've conjured something in their mind to manipulate how they perceive the situation. Taking someone at their (probably) insincere word to get them to stop is not gaslighting. 
492,He quite literally struck you. What would it take for you to see him as abusive?
493,"My bio mom has pulled the same stuff, in an attempt to get me back into her life after she walked out (and finally I let her stay out). It's a tough call, and only one you can make, but it is so much drama being pulled into this shitstorm several times over. Its never going to end until she gets her act together, and it sounds like she may not. 



When I cut my mom out, I mourned the loss of her as if she died. Our relationship died and I can't undo all the hurt she's caused. She had more than enough chances, and did nothing. For me it would be a major step backwards to go back to having even a limited contact relarionship with her. You've had a really great year without her, this is like an alcoholic taking a drink after a year of sobriety thinking ""this time will be different.""  



I wish you the best in whatever you decide. Its good thar your partner supports you! "
494,"Holy Choosing Beggars batman.

I would speak my mind. Not in front of her family but in private, yes. You're entitled to your views, reasonable ones at that! She needs a come to Jesus talk."
495,"He doesn't have a decent employment opportunity *right now*. They don't have enough money for maternity clothing or winter shoes. How is she the one making rash decisions and not him? Yes, he would have been financially dependent on her, but there would have *been* financials. "
496,"Why is this guy still your boyfriend? He tried to cheat on you and that's bad enough. You really have no reason to trust him and if you stay with him, he will eventually cheat on you."
497,"A therapist will also help her figure out what are reasonable expectations regarding what OP can do for her. They can come up with better coping mechanisms for her than having him by her side at all times. That isn't healthy, she needs to develop healthier options for herself."
498,"She lives with you part time that means you have a say. I know you aren't confrontational but you need to ask her directly to clean up her stuff. Then you need to sit your husband down and tell him that you don't care that she was ""spoiled from a young age"" (such a lame excuse) and that if she is going to live there part time then she needs to clean up, if she doesn't want to do that then she doesn't need to live there part time. It's your space too.

499,"That's so juvenile and unattractive, good god."
500,To give her the benefit of the doubt... maybe she is just actually an idiot.
501,"Even if she hadn't turned her life around, women who sleep with multiple partners are not wrong or dirty or sluts or whatever other words his old high school friends used. And I'd bet that half the stories he was told were untrue. Highschool is notoriously unfair to girls who are viewed as frigid or slutty, with no in between.

That said, it sounds like your friend had an awful childhood, and fell into the classic behaviour that a lot of victims of abuse show. They think they're not worthy or are broken in some way, deserving somehow of their abuse, and then start to act in a way to make that true. The fact she's turned that around is amazing and your boyfriend needs too pull his head out of his ass and be as proud of her as you are.

Try getting him to Google what happens to abuse victims, and how hard it is to pull yourself out of that mind set. "
502,"Agreed, the only mistake OP and his was made was confirming they called CPS.

It’s very likely this woman is participating in the abuse or is being abused herself. Information you share with her is certainly being shared with this dangerous man.

Be prepared to write down or record (laws depending) all of your interactions with this family from now on."
503,"Are you kidding? OPs wife seems to be having some kind of psychotic episode, was rushed to the emergency room on doctors orders and you’re advising him to make sure she keeps pumping and find a professional nanny to evaluate the home of the wife’s closest friend? That’s great advice in normal circumstances, but normal this is not. Let’s keep that in perspective. "
504,"&gt; and that R knows about her feelings towards me. She also admitted that while she was staying in my apartment, she had a hard time resisting the urge to get physical with me.

So she cheated on her ex-husband and now the same scenario is about to repeat itself.... I wouldn't be surprised if R has no idea what's going on.

&gt; I really don't want to break up a marriage just because she admitted that she wanted to jump my bones.

Tbh, I'd screenshot the texts and send them to R. Then I'd distance myself from both of them.
"
505,"This. OP's friend A is an abuser, full stop."
506,"Okay, as her *husband, this is ABSOLUTELY, 100% your business. Her mental health stopped being her problem alone when you had a child together. Her psychosis regarding the ""stalking"" is indicative of serious chemical imbalance issues/mental health issues, and your daughter's safety is on the line. It's time to step outside what is normally acceptable within a relationship, because women suffering PPD have been known to actually get so mentally ill they harm their children! 

It's your job as a parent to protect your children, even from your spouse! Ultimately, your wife is suffering a very common (and very treatable) post-partum issue. It only becomes a serious issue when left untreated/unaddressed. She's had ample time to seek help on her own and refused it. It's time to go over her head. Please, please contact her OB/GYN or PCP. Let them know EXACTLY what your concerns are. It may take something as drastic as what's called a ""section 12"" in the US (involuntary 72 hr commitment for evaluation). It may not. But she absolutely NEEDS treatment, and if nobody's communicating with her healthcare providers, this problem will only amplify itself, placing your wife and child in more danger with every single day that passes she's left untreated. 

My best recommendation is that you immediately contact one of her Drs. Your wife may initially be angry with you, or feel betrayed, but that would be her illness talking. When you married her, you essentially accepted responsibility for her, and part of that is accepting responsibility for helping her make decisions when she's clearly too ill to do so on her own. THIS is an ""extenuating circumstance"". If She's alone with the baby for long periods while you're working? If she's struggling to even admit there's a problem, while simultaneously exhibiting psychotic thinking? This is a fucking EMERGENCY!

507,"Make sure she didn’t lure you into this situation with the intent on quoting and having you pay all the rent

If so go to the realestate and review your options with them , now before you owes months of rent and are bitter with you partner for using you "
508,"2 things: dump her, she sounds awful,

And

You need to take responsibility for not doing your own networking that night. You missed out on opportunities because you were mad that your gf wasn't helping you. After the first 10 minutes of her acting that way, you should have said, ok fine, go home. And then spend the night networking. You messed up the opportunity. Not her. She didn't help, but it wasn't her responsibility. You go above and beyond for her and she does not reciprocate. That's something that should make you reconsider the relationship, but it is not the reason you didn't network that night. That is your fault. "
509,Dump him. There's a whole world of experiences out there.
510,"That's exactly it. He kept saying ""at least we're together now"". I just feel like as expensive as it is here we have no hope for the type of life we could have had back home. I've already joined a group for moms and am working with my OB to find a new counselor. Might be time for marriage counseling too. I feel like the trust is gone. "
511,"I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he just made that up on the spot, because he's embarrassed by his own gnarliness. Your investigation so far would certainly seem to bear that out.

Btw, when I read your title, I thought you literally meant RIGHT BEFORE your actual wedding, like on the day of...which, yikes."
512,Especially given the fact that he *knew* how old she was when they had sex.
513,"&gt;Then my boyfriend accused me of lying to him ... I'm very hurt that he believed the word of someone he didn't know over me. 

I hope you realize that no matter what happens in the next few weeks, your relationship with this guy is over.   You can go through  the motions of being a couple but he didn't just fail at standing up for his partner, he has been too cowardly to acknowledge it.  Start planning your exit from the relationship now.

&gt; they said some really hurtful things about how I was a screw up and killing a child just proved that. 

Do not rug-sweep their reaction.   No matter what they want to call it, it was a massive failure of parenting.   If they won't deal with  that, you don't have to deal with them."
514,"&gt;once he comes home, he takes over all care for Ryan, so that I can have time to myself and he also does the same when he gets a day off.

No wonder he works 70 or 80 hours a week.

I agree with your husband 100%. It would be incredibly selfish to have another child when your spouse isn't on board and you two are overloaded with your current obligations to your son.

If your argument boils down to ""I deserve it"" it is almost 100% likely to be bullshit."
515,"""I have a boyfriend. Please stop pushing me to contact your son socially. He's too old for me even if I were single."" "
516,"Not being in the field, I can't say for sure that is the case but denver area teachers are on the verge of a strike/walk out over the amount they get paid. One of my friends has a master's degree in teaching and can't find jobs that will pay enough for her degree and level of experience. It's hard out here for  teachers."
517,"&gt;'Your jeans are too tight' or 'your legs look good while you're running' 

These comments have sexual undertones. They are creepy spoken by your father. He's checking out your backside and body from the waist down. I hope you can move away soon."
518,"Being strong and firm with your words is not something bad, and it doesn't mean that you're gonna hurt him. If you're not interested, look him in the eye and firmly say that you're not interested. No means no, and he has to respect your decisions."
519,"You broke up with him. You can hardly expect him to console you over the reason for it!

You have a pretty unrealistic attitude. You hurt his feelings, but you made it all about you.

You’re definitely being a bit of an asshole over it."
520,"From the examples you gave, she hasn’t said anything negative about this girl that pertains to her class status. Now, maybe she’s said more class-related criticisms to you, or connected her criticisms with the girl’s class in some way. If that’s the case, then yeah, it sounds like she’s class-conscious. But if what you said in the post is ALL she’s said, then I invite you to consider the fact that you’re being completely class-biased yourself. You’re assuming your girlfriend has a specific negative quality because she’s from a specific class background. You’re doing exactly what you don’t want your girlfriend to do - judging somebody’s actions based on class stereotypes.

There’s plenty of reasons why she might have said her brother’s fiance is not intelligent or not successful careerwise that have NOTHING to do with class. Maybe the fiance really just isn’t smart or successful. Maybe your gf feels threatened by a new woman entering her family. Maybe she thinks her brother won’t be happy in the long-run. Maybe the fiance has rubbed her the wrong way. I’m not saying it’s kind of your gf to be so critical, nor am I saying her criticism is definitely justified or valid (it could be, though). But I am saying that based on your post it seems less like she was being class-conscious, and more like you were. You’re self-conscious of your class compared to hers, and your insecurity is coloring your perspective as a result.

Just food for thought."
521,"You and this person are not headed in the same direction. You don't require a ""valid reason"" . The fact that it isnt working for you is reason enough to end the relationship "
522,"A couple of small changes:

""WomansName, this is the last time I will tell you this: stop contacting me.   I have no interest in hearing from you.  Stop coming to my home. You are harassing me and my family.  Any communication from you at this point forward will be considered harassment and I will document each attempt and I will involve the police.   Do not respond to this email, even to acknowledge this message."""
523,This is the kind of complication that you buy into when you try to incorporate breaks into a relationship. 
524,Didn’t go home with him or let him come over thankfully! 
525,"DUMP HIM. Seriously he doesn't respect you, the work you do, or even take care of himself. Where is the upside in being with him?"
526,"I’m not sure what’s the fixation people have with this sort of nonsense. Maybe I’m just getting old and it’s a maturity thing, but in all the years I’ve been with my s/o I still haven’t asked for their “number”. Who cares? Ignorance is a blessing when the answer is most likely going to hurt you no matter how low or high it is. 

But anyway. The only advice to give at this point is by no means can you make her feel bad or think less of her for her number. And you have to embrace the fact that she’s with you now so these past people pretty much don’t mean squat. Your only options are to get over yourself or break up 🤷🏻‍♀️"
527,HE'S SAVING ME FROM A BUG... OMG HE MUST BE CHEATING ON ME... BETTER MAKE SURE! *snoop*
528,"Honestly,  this would be a dealbreaker to me.  Like if at 37 you can't have an adult conversation without snot and tears what other screws are loose in there?"
529,"Okay let’s first acknowledge how stupid, tacky, and unethical it is to sleep with your boss even if single. Like seriously? Add the part about her being engaged and in a monogamous relationship. Ew ew ew. Don’t marry her. This isn’t just a red flag or something therapy or counseling worthy. Drop her if you have even a little bit of respect for yourself. "
530,face “upkeep”?? who IS this guy !?
531,"I always think of these situations as a knob tax. Imagine paying $35 to find out which of your friends are deep down, actual knobs. 

Its quite a good deal. Give her $35, keep the bra, stop being her friend. If she is a good friend you dont want to lose, explain the situation to her, try to understand why she thinks the bra is ruined and go from there. You are entitled to disagree with her.. see how much she also values the friendship. If she is willing to end it over $35 then she is a knob and not worth the time. "
532,"I think the main thing to call out here is not that OP would be abandoning her, she needs to learn how to process her own feelings healthily. Her response sucks (and is uncomfortable for everyone) but he can be positive, calm, and accepting of it while she works through it.

 Some people are easy criers. I have friends that cry easily and react. That said, they are fully responsible for their behaviour while they have that reaction - they're not forcing me to stare at them or stomping around. They understand they are overwhelmed and are communicative. Your GF sounds like she needs therapy because she hasn't progressed past the type of behaviour a child does to express to a parent. She doesn't need therapy because she feels strongly, thats a great thing, but she does need it because she becomes immature and controlling while she is experiencing those feelings."
533,"I think instead of focusing on getting her to stop you should say something like ""Sometimes when we discuss issues she starts pouting/crying/puking/acting like a general lunatic (I'm kidding obviously don't say that.) How can we get around this barrier to communication? It prevents us from working through even simple issues."" You should be honest about the severity and the frequency because this is a big deal.

Tbh I'd also encourage her to see a doctor on her own because there is no way that's normal. How is she even functional? Does she have a job? Does she act like that with others? Because if not I think there is a *very* good chance it's a manipulation tactic."
534,"Your fiance's lack of dental/oral hygiene would be a dealbreaker to me. The fact that he purposefully hit you with a low blow to harm your self-esteem is a huge red flag and honestly, I would not be marrying this guy until you figure out a) what's his deal with poor oral hygiene and b) why he thinks it's ok to hit you with such a low blow to punish you. Maybe now is the time to get some premarital counseling together before tying the knot, but I would be postponing the wedding at this point to figure this stuff out. "
535,"Put yourself in her shoes, would you want to know?"
536,"I work in cardiology and I sobbed the first time my patient passed. (Aortic dissection tore during cath procedure. No one knew about it until it broke open. Doctor was affected pretty hard too.)

It's okay to have boundaries, that's how you end up surviving. However never ever lose that compassion you have for people. When you lose that the people you serve end up losing too. With some experience under your belt you'll find a nice, comfortable place where you can keep your sanity. It may take some time, but you'll get there."
537,"The child element aside for a moment, James is dating a woman who would willingly claim that a child that her boyfriend knows is basically hers after 6 months? He's got a storm coming if the relationship continues.

Regarding your situation, you as Mum get to decide who sees your child and when, period. If you don't want Tracy around your kid then that is totally fine, and if James kicks up a fuss or goes behind your back about it then you have ample grounds to stop contact. Of course your daughter's feelings are important here, and as another comment says, you might need to wean her off of him if she doesn't understand why she's not seeing him anymore."

He's bullshitting her, and using her as a weapon against you. Indeed, she is quite stupid and this can't be tolerated, but he is the source of this harassment."
540,"OP, you don’t need an “excuse” to have boundaries. A reasonable person should respect your boundaries. If he won’t then that’s an indication he’s not a reasonable person. Trust your gut. This request makes you uncomfortable. Say no."
541,"Yeah, you don’t need to tell her she doesn’t have a chance in hell.

Tell her what it takes and then let the burden of responsibility fall on her"
542,Maybe I am projecting but I can see a lot of problems down the line with this situation.
543,"&gt;It does seem bonkers, you're right. But I would already have an advanced degree and a well-paying job by the time we got married 

Uhhh no, you wouldn't. Because those jobs aren't available in your location and he isn't gonna move. "

Seriously. Do not undermine your stepmother’s counter-suit in a vain attempt to win some of your father’s love back. You already know it won’t work, and it *will* damage your relationship with the only trustworthy parent-figure in your life. Stay mum on the legal shit.

My ex was addicted to games, and we lived together. I broke up with him because of the emotional and physical neglect. You don't deserve to suffer."
547,I disagree. A babysitter has the authority to watch over someone's child but that doesn't mean that their choices have to be tolerated by the parents if they don't like them
548,I wonder if it's possible for SIL to Shadow OP and see what the day to day is like. If she wants to be like a tv lawyer I believe she is in a rude awakening. Most tv portrayals are fantasy of the reality. 
549,"It's perfectly valid for him to feel this way immediately after learning about her past. A lot of people resent those who participate in cheating and other destructive behaviors. You need to acknowledge his feelings even though you disagree with them. 

Then you need to reinforce that she has committed herself to stopping those destructive behaviors. He didn't get to see her journey, he doesn't need her full biography but a brief explanation of how she decided to acknowledge her bad decisions and make positive changes would mean more than ""look she changed when she turned 18 so who cares"". "
550,"A situation that wouldn’t never happened if op wasn’t trying to play co-parent with a man who is indeed not the father of her child. She left her kid with a man who is not legally or biologically tied to said kid and his girlfriend. The only red flags I see are with op.

The problem is James is keeping his ex around his new relationship and his ex is trying to turn him into a father figure for a child that isn’t his own. So unless op is okay with Tracy being a step mother type of figure, she needs to stop trying to use her daughter as a reason to stick around her ex. If anything, I think Tracy is being super understanding considering she’s younger than both of them and not really contributing to any of this very unnecessary drama and baggage. "
551,"He tried to do one thing in his life without his disabled son, for himself. And he argued that having his son there would ruin it for him. And OP got offended, and added some guilt and emotional blackmail over how he wanted to have one aspect in his life not sacrificed for his son. So OP insists on bringing son anyway, who totally ruins the competition for not only OP's husband, but OP's husbands' teammates as well, EXACTLY AS PREDICTED. 

He works two full time jobs, and then takes over for OP so SHE can have breaks? When exactly is husband getting breaks? Sounds like never. And OP wants MORE sacrifice from him? OP blew clean past all his normal human limits so she can get what she wants, and it still isn't enough for her?

Jesus.

552,"While it’s very possible there’s a weird “setup” thing going on here, I have family in small towns and I’m a few hours away in the “big city.” There are at least occasional suggestions of “oh, you know, X-random-person just moved to *city! You should get together and show them around, you’re so close!” And most times these definitely aren’t setup-type things, but more the small-town vague worry - you’re so far away from home! you must be so lonely away from the family! you need friends nearby that remind you of home!

For me, I’d stick with politely avoiding the topic, or at least wouldn’t just automatically assume they were trying to get you two on a date (unless they casually mention his single status or talk about what a catch he is or something) "
553,"This. A hundred times, this."

Also, this post made me laugh-- you're a descriptive writer!"
555,"r/EmilineLupine's situation worked out really well, but this guy seems like he's going after you from insecurity and sexism rather than a lack of boundaries.

Yeah, I think you need to confront him in an assertive but calm way. ""Please stop saying these things about me. I don't like it, and it's ruining my enjoyment of the game."" You don't need to justify, argue, defend, explain. And I'd advise you not to get worked up or hurt when he (most likely) fails to honor your request. Just calmly repeat ""Please stop saying things like that.""

Cause, unfortunately, in situations like this (and assuming that you don't want to leave this group), the real deciders are the other group members. Jackass is clearly not going to stop for your sake. Your other friend has expressed that he doesn't think it's a big deal. I think that he should respect your feelings, but fine, whatever. The more calm and monotonous you are in responding to him--refusing to argue or apologize for your feelings--the more his refusal to follow your requests is going to seem like he's the one causing trouble.

557,"&gt; Bakasyonbreakup : *My [F24] boyfriend [M27] cheated. Do I break up with him before or after their first ever family vacation?*

Before - so that instead of enjoying his vacation, he'll be thinking about getting dumped, and he'll be wondering who you're getting mixed up with while he's gone, and he'll be getting an earful from his parents about how dumb he was for screwing this up.

If you respect his parents, you wouldn't take advantage of them by going on this vacation when you know you're gonna bail. If you respect yourself, you wouldn't keep faking it with your (soon-to-be-ex-)boyfriend until the vacation is over."
558,"&gt; How can you be friends with this unstable person???? A stalker, a cheater, a liar....

let's all be honest here, this is abuse. OP, your friend is an abuser. Is that really who you want to be friends with? that's really ok with you?"
559,You can take this as a very good lesson what a relationship shouldn't be.
560,"I’m not doubting you. But yeah, some people are militantly anti machine washing bras. 

But $35 is not an expensive bra so she’s just being dramatic. Don’t borrow anything from her again. "
561,"&gt; As my daughter grew a little bit older, she saw James as a de-facto parent, a role that he happily stepped up to. She knows that he isn’t ‘Daddy’, but had the strongest bond with him of anyone outside of the biological family.

In this situation, it is good that the man is keeping relationship even as role changed. Had he stopped seeing the child, that is when the childs trust and relationship would be broken. It does not seem like the kid was thinking James is father, I read it more that he was playing with her, teaching her what to do and what not to do etc. He was involved and had genuine two way relationship with the kid (meaning he misses the kid too). 

Then he took less of role and still have genuine relationship with kid - so he effectively took role of active divorced father. That is the best scenario for kid and not all that common. All in all, it seems that in many major ways the participants act in best interest of kid and in mature ways without unnecessary drama, abrupt changes, a person going no contact, lies that would break trust or anything like that.

"
562,"Good job OP! I know you've been dealt a rough hand recently but  you are so strong and doing such an amazing job looking out for your family. Hopefully, with help this will pass and with times things will get better and easier. Hang in there!

We're all rooting for you. If you're so inclined tell us how it went. It not we understand. "
563,"Okay. Let's say he's cheating. It's probably over, right? That's easy.

But let's say he *isn't* cheating. He's just distant and uninterested in sex and irritable and untrusting and suspicious and unwilling to go to couples counseling. You feel like you're dragging him into marriage. Your relationship is on the rocks and it's making your anxiety worse. Does it actually matter if he's cheating or not? He's not being a good partner to you. Faithfulness doesn't change that.

You mentioned the long talk you had about what it would take for you to trust him. Did he actually do any of those things? Is he still doing them?

You *are not happy.* You don't get to marry the man he was in the rearview, the man you remember, the man you fell in love with. He isn't that person anymore. You would be marrying the man he is now, the man who makes your anxiety race and who doesn't trust you and doesn't deserve your trust.

It doesn't mater if he's cheating. Even if he's being faithful, I would end it."

Mine has said to me in the past over short and tight pairs of shorts, ""I see you're not going to bother putting on pants before you go out,"" but I'd just roll my eyes because it's not sexual in the slightest. It's just him being like ""hey I wouldn't personally be comfortable wearing that if I were you but you do you."" But the comment about OP's legs looking good and ""touched my body"" has me concerned. I'd like to know more about what kinds of touches because I feel like it has to be more than a pat on the shoulder or something normal to be causing such an extreme level of discomfort. "
566,"Unfortunately, brutal honesty means you hear things that are painful. You're not wrong for wanting another child, but he's not wrong for *not* wanting another child. While you may have planned to have more children, sometimes plans change in the face of reality. 

Take your time thinking about this and keep the lines of communication open with your spouse. You're both in an awful position. I'm sure he's just as heartbroken at the prospect of loosing his family too.

I wish you peace with whatever outcomes you choose."

569,"Yeah...this is the truly crazy part. Facts would be more like ""He gets married to someone local and has kids. She finds a new person in her new location. They meet like 5 years down the road and have a 10 min awkward catch up convo that show they have nothing to say any more."""

I'm trying to change the habits and set an example for my kid. Some days she's the one reminding me! (She's 22mos and all about it)."
571,"&gt; I feel like that conversation is impossible. She will cry and I will fold. 

Then you are NOT ready for marriage, FULL STOP.  It sucks, but you need to be able to do what you have to do even if it is unpleasant.  Look at it this way. Right now, you are both miserable. You need to do something because you can't stay like this forever.  

Hopefully she will snap out of her resistance and begin working toward getting better with you, but either way, this is no way to live, and you need to take the first step. "
572,"God, this guy sounds like such a drain on your life. Fuck that. Just say to him, “I’ve told you before that I felt this wasn’t working for me anymore, and nothing has changed here. It is not working, I do not want to be with you anymore and it is not up for negotiation. We are over” and wish him luck in life, maybe he’ll wise up and make something of himself? Maybe you breaking up with him will be the kick up the ass that he needs? If he is depressed over it, he has friends to help him cope and there are services available for people like him. If he threatens suicide, call the police and cut ties - I know from experience that people will threaten suicide to scare you into staying with them and make empty promises for a little while, and then things will go back to how they always were. Don’t fall for it. You’re a smart woman and you’ve got your shit together, you deserve someone who will encourage you to grow, not hinder it. "

578,"He's likely projecting. I'm a dentist, and on dental forums sometimes we get posts from other dentists who see patients who are young women who are convinced that they have bad breath because of something their partners have said in malice.

I am so sorry your wife seems to be experiencing some psychosis and how scary and awful this must be for the both of you. Thank you for acting so swiftly as well and taking everyone’s advice as tough as it may be. I hope your wife gets the help she needs and that you can get some help as well honestly while this is going on along with everything changing in your own life. What you are going through ... I cannot even imagine. You are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders between what has happened to your mom, your brother, and your dad transitioning, plus your wife. On top of that you have a new baby - which is exciting, but still very stressful and tiring and just a huge life change in general. Seeking out some therapy yourself would probably be hugely beneficial especially since you don’t have your wife at this moment as a support. So much love to you and your family, OP!

589,"100% agree. It’s very immature behavior from both of them. Yeah, girlfriend was being an asshole but she’s not his mommy. A 40+ year old professional man should be able to function at an important work event even if his 40 year old girlfriend is acting like a teenager. 

You should break up and grow up. "
590,"At the very least, do NOT get married to her anytime soon.

&gt; She also doesn’t think she can curb her feelings for this other person

She can't always control how she feels, but she can control her actions. Deleting texts, talking about kissing, going out with him to drink, that weird photo, etc. (oh, and whatever else she hasn't told you). She had full control over all of those things and chose to do them anyway."
591,"Tell your husband to get fucked for that. Maybe it was all innocent, but that was seriously a cruel question to ask in front of your mother when he had a feeling it would be someone your mother knew. That's unbelievably shitty. And the fact that he wasn't like, ""oh my god I'm sorry, I had a feeling but I didn't think that in a million years he'd really admit to it"" afterwards really makes me mad. Sounds like he has no respect for your parents. 

You can't do anything about your parents' relationship other than treating your mother the same as you always do, other than an extra hug and phone call here and there (she might interpret any more as pity, and people don't often enjoy feeling like they're being pitied). Your parents have to work this out themselves. Your husband, on the other hand, needs a serious talk about his cruel and disrespectful actions. You should really sit him down and ask him seriously why he would do that, and if he would ever embarrass you like that. That shit was garbage and you know it. He needs a reality check if he thinks he can treat your parents like that. "
592,"&gt;hey (understandably) feel as if I am abandoning him in his time of need, and have said that I am no longer welcome around them. 

His first response was to tank your relationship with his family, so you might want to think what that would look like going forward."

594,"It is possible (not saying true, but this can happen) that getting married and being called and seen as a ""wife"" has flared up your wife's gender dysphoria. Whether your wife is trans in the sense of needing to transition may not be known yet, but it sounds like she's dealing with gender dysphoria and will probably need to explore that. Is there any flexibility for this in your mind and your relationship? I've known quite a few couples where one has ultimately transitioned, and some are still married, some are divorced but best friends, some don't talk at all. I know it's scary, but if you're willing to head down this road together you never know where you will end up."
595,"&gt;My boyfriend believes that A is a hypocrite and he is now despising her because he hates cheaters and considers this cheating.

A is emotionally cheating at the very least.

And I agree with your BF.  You do a lot of justifying for your friend in this post, but IMO, you need to stop defending her actions.  It just enables her to repeat them over and over.

Tell P what is going on, or let your BF do it if you can't.  He deserves to know that his good behavior is being rewarded with a knife in his back."

Even if her behavior on the night in question didn't convince you her sexual interest didn't include you, her being straight certainly should have.  I don't think there was ever really a potential here for a mutual sexual relationship between the three of you - just between her and your boyfriend.

The feeling your experiencing is probably just rejection.  You remember rejection from your younger dating days, don't you?  It'll pass.  I would also advise you keep the relationship strictly monogamous if you have the capacity for jealousy and paranoia you indicate in the latter part of your post.  It's never going to be a good idea to open up this relationship for you, at all, and it's unfair and hypocritical to be upset or paranoid about your boyfriend's inner thoughts and likelihood to cheat on you, when you initiated and participated in this situation from the beginning."

610,"Fellow lawyer here, hijacking this comment. 

The other consideration even more important than whether she can get in to law school is whether she can pass the bar. I have no idea when OP sat, but the bar now a days is much more difficult than it was a decade or two ago. 

The biggest predictors of bar exam success are LSAT score, undergrad GPA and 1L grades. Some people can outperform their predictors but she doesn’t sound like one of those people. Allowing her to go in to 150k of debt (because no school in this nation is giving her a scholarship) only to never be able to practice is honestly mean. 

Rip off the bandaid - about what the law is really like, about her chances of getting in, about the realities of that kind of debt, and about the possibility that *anyone* will hire her if she goes to a low tier or unranked law school. It might hurt her feelings in the short term but it’ll help her in the long run. 

On the flip side, she can always become a paralegal. I know a few people who went that route and ended up doing well for themselves as lawyers. Plus schools will forgive her UG GPA with some stellar work experiences and references. But at the very least, if she ever will be a good candidate for law school, she needs to know that day is not today. "

627,"I get that you're frustrated now, but try seeing it from her perspective. Let's say for this example that she usually makes dinner and while you've both always done this (or fallen into the habit), you've never really discussed it. Maybe she could post something like this:

&gt;This morning I was in a good mood and had dinner planned out when my husband went to work. I kept texting him over and over but he wouldn't reply. When he came back he was stressed out from a bad day and just wanted to sit and relax. Ok. He'd brought some ingredients back, so that was good.

&gt;I started prepping the food and he sets the table for the meal. I always chop the vegetables though and I'm getting bored of it, so I stop and stare into space for a while. Eventually the food starts going cold and he asks me if I can keep making dinner. I oblige and he just waits for dinner, as usual. I don't give in. I wait in front of the cooker until everything starts burning. Instantly he asks, ""aren't you going to keep cooking?"" I reply, ""Aren't you?""

Obviously this is a little ridiculous and I'm not trying to equate sex with a chore, but hopefully this helps you see why you can't just suddenly decide you're not happy with the status quo and expect your partner to read your mind. 

Instead of making it some weird challenge where you ""don't give in"" and she ""swallows her pride"", why not have an actual conversation? TALK about why she has a problem with initiating, and why you have a problem with her not doing that. Working together against the problem will get you a lot further than working against each other.

Also, please never say ""sexy-time"" or ""Aww, yus"" ever again.

630,"I've never understood the ""let's just be friends"" element of breakups. Like it seems to just be the goal of every breakup or parting. That's the default ""win"" condition. And yet so much pain and angst comes out of partners hanging onto these ""friends"" to the detriment of their current relationship.

The bottom line is this: being wanted is a huge ego boost. Even if we have no desire to sleep with that person, just being desirable just feels great. Sometimes our desire for this ego boost outweighs our desire to make our current partners happy. Since you don't really provide many details about your girlfriend's selfishness levels and tendencies, it's hard to say whether she's acting maliciously or if her subconcious desire for this ego boost has taken control and is steering the car.

I think you gotta take a good, hard look at your girlfriend and what kind of person she is in OTHER areas to get to the bottom of exactly what's motivating her here: selfishness or naivete.

I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it's not looking that great. Thee fact that this is her ""rebound"" guy from your two month gap is really galling.  Like if this was her high school boyfriend and they were pals for years after and then you came along, then she might have more of a leg to stand on. But this guy is just a cudgel to beat you with on an emotional level. Why keep him around? 

Also missing is the cause of your breakup. Like is there any way this guy factored into that? If so, keeping him around in ANY capacity is a total nonstarter. Like right now as you've written things there's like a 10 percent chance this is all above board. If he was an active participant in the reason your relationship fell apart the first time, this plummets to 0."

636,Pro tip: don’t take your friends’ girlfriends out alone. And don’t hold their hands... wtf is wrong with you? 
637,"&gt;Both my parents and my boyfriend are acting like everything is fine because I didn't actually have an abortion, but I'm really crushed about how they treated me. 

Have you had a discussion with your parents to let them know how betrayed you feel?   My cousin once told my grandmother a big lie about me.  I discovered it because she repeated it to my mother and both made excuses rather than defending me.   Quite honestly, it changed my relationship with my mother forever.  I wasn't fatal but she never acknowledged her failure and I was never really able to confide in her again.

From what you said, your parents used this incident as justifications to air old grievances.  You need to let them know that their failure to believe in you is not something you can just forget, that something has been lost and you don't know if it can ever be recovered.   If you think some family counseling could help you fashion a better relationship with your parents going forward, you might want to try it.   Otherwise, put as much distance between you and them as you need."
638,"&gt;I’ve tried to bring it up to him several times, but he won’t answer me. He actually sits there in silence whenever I try to talk to him about it.

Does he handle all of your other disagreements / discussions this way?   How long have the two of you been together?  How long have you lived together?  

Honestly, his refusal to do this very small thing for you does not speak well for his commitment to your relationship.  It's a red flag and you should be very seriously considering this when you think about the future of your relationship."
639,"Girl no. You are physically stopping him and he hasn't learned to fuck you in a way that feels good to you. The absolute minimum you deserve in a relationship is pain free sex. THE MINIMUM. And you aren't getting it, because he is deliberately not giving it to you. You need to dump him and find someone who can fuck you with the respect and care that you deserve."
640,You should go for your dream job in a city you like. 7 months is not that long of a relationship. Be glad it was good so you know what to look for when you move. 
641,But why was she snooping on your phone in the first place? That's shitty behavior on her part.
642,"Different person. If all you expected was number 1, when did you keep on returning to your GF? A partner who engages small talk with people is nice, but isn't really necessary to network. You can just as easily network with a #1 as you can with one. 

You might not have wanted a full-blown version of #2, but it's pretty clear that you thought your GF was necessary to that night and needed to help you promote.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, you GF was clearly not exiting her comfort zone to help you, but your GF really does not seem like a person who enjoys engaging with people she feels like she no business talking to. "
643,"Ohhhh shit, I know this game and yeah I'd be annoyed a t my partner too. I don't wanna derail this too much but it shouldn't be game ending with a bit of work (I assume you used a titanite slab on this weapon though but I think there's two in the game if you don't mind a spoiler). "
644,Thank you so much. That means a lot to me. I owe my mum and my friends a lot of credit- they lent me their strength when I didn’t have any. I am still trying to come to terms with all of it and somedays are tougher than others. 
645,"“My daughter and I occasionally visit James” there’s no formal arrangement here. I find it interesting that so many people would vouch for total no contact between OPs daughter and an influential adult she’s close to. Why? Because that’s the norm? 

2 people were together and committed for years. Some of those years were formative years for OPs daughter. This man was willing to be part of a couple, and take on parental responsibilities.  Clearly there have always been boundaries to those responsibilities. 

Usually when a stepparent leaves the picture the child is completely abandoned too despite having established an emotional bond. Maybe they’re going about this is a flawed way, but I see 2 adults putting their issues behind them to benefit a child and maintain a casual friendship. Hard to navigate? Sure. And so is an important adult figure completely walking out of your life. 

Not sure we need to judge the effort to put her first here. "
646,Your dad is basically telling you that he was a total POS back in the day. 
647,Did she say what she expected you to do instead? Let your dog be in pain for another day? Not go with your ex to put her down and not spend that time with her? I don't understand what the alternative would have been to what happened. 
648,"I agree that OP should just stick to the facts as stated above.  Any hint he thinks she's not smart enough will result in alienation that will affect your relationship forever.  And it may crush her self-esteem.    

I also agree with what others have advised, is there a specific reason she wants to be an attorney?    Can he ask her how her tutoring is going?  Is she enjoying her classes?  What does she like best about them?  If she becomes an attorney, what area of law would she like to go into?  Does she like interacting with people the most or the paperwork?  (And emphasize there is lots of paperwork and continual education needed even after you get a degree.)  Can OP feel her out on this and see if he can gently guide her into another career?

I personally know several women who started in support roles, both in the law arena and administration that ended up becoming professionals in those areas after many years.  Maybe encouraging her to try working in a law office to get a feel for it."
649,"Keep calling when you hear abusive shit.

Piece of shit mom doesn't even protect her kids. Trash.

Also you need to call CPS or the cops AND your landlord to document their behavior. Definitely not okay and needs to be addressed.

Also does this guy have a parole officer? Ask if you can find out."
650,"Your boyfriend is an insecure piece of shit that takes his own problems out on you. This sort of immature behavior is totally inappropriate for a 35 year old to display. He doesn’t like that he’s gained weight, but he doesn’t want to do anything about it, so he’s directing his self loathing onto you. He doesn’t want to deal with the fact that he doesn’t think he is as attractive because of weight gain, so he attacks yours. Then, he doesn’t want to be bothered with getting in shape so whenever you go to the gym it throws his lack of effort back in his face so he criticizes you for that too. 

If he was your age I’d say there’s hope he’ll mature and change but a 35 year old a man doing this shit probably isn’t going to grow up any time soon. Don’t let him make you feel shitty. You deserve to be praised and celebrated and you deserve a partner who uplifts you instead of dragging you down. "
651,"It's weird that your boyfriend seems so bothered by this. It happened in High School and you say Lisa has turned her life around. 

This just seems silly"
652,"Step one: Stop calling sex ""sexy-time.""
Step two: Cool it with the ""Aww, yus."""
653,All males in HS want sex. An 18M going after a 14F is creepy asf. His mind is much more developed than yours and he’s taking advantage of that. 
654,"That’s a major red flag my dude. If you’re engaged to get married, in two months no less, this should be the last thing on her mind. 

The fact she asked you for a free pass likely means even if you say no she’s gonna do it anyway. I don’t think I could be with somebody who did that, as I know I’d be constantly paranoid about it. How would she react if you did this to her? 

Maybe I’m just old fashioned, but if you think your boss/friend/colleague is hot that’s fine, but actually asking your SO if you can make out with them is extremely disrespectful. 

"
655,"This guy sounds like he's hanging out with the kind of asshole men who get married, volun-force their wives to be stay at home moms (honey it's cheaper than a babysitter and you can only work part time, this is definitely a better financial decision!), then are absolutely furious 10 years down the line when a divorce happens and they have to pay child support and/or alimony.

Marriage involves a pooling of resources and finances. You're supposed to be a team. Having separate finances for the ""fun money"" side of things makes total sense, but I cannot imagine earning 3 times my partner and pulling this shit."
656,Lol sweating from a nightmare. Ain’t nobody got time for that! You’re 25....next! 
657,"I think you're reading too much into this. My guess is that J enjoys flirting with your bf partly because it's 'safe' - she knows it's not going to turn into anything so she can just have fun with it. Even if she does really like him, the fact she refused the offer is a great sign as it suggests she has drawn the line and won't go there. So what if she likes him, so long as she respects your relationship enough not to act on it?

The way she dealt with this is 100% the best response she could have given. Let her flirt for fun if she wants, and don't make the mistake of considering a close friend for a threesome again!"
658,you would do this to any girl you were with. You could be with andrian lima and you'd find a problem. No one is perfect. You're TRYING to find a problem and should talk to a therapist about why.
659,"Every time I try to talk about it I feel like it turns into me being the bad guy. Idk how but I end up crying harder than when I started. I understand I can’t just fix this as much as I want to. 

How can I talk to her without making her cry? I have a very hard time handling it now. I’ve told her how her emotions make me feel and it moves to how She is sorry she is “broken”. This makes me feel worse. I don’t want her to think I am upset because she is sad or emotional. I get upset because she is barely the same person anymore. 

Also I don’t know how I would call off the wedding. I’m scared she would hurt herself or die from sadness or something. Plus we live together and pay bills together. Calling off/postponing the wedding would punch a huge hold in our relationship. "
660,this part was actually quite upsetting to my wife as well. She said the whole thing just seemed like an after-thought.
661,Replace the screws with 4 inch long ones on all hinges and locks. Remove one from each of that has a different kind of screw and bring with you to the hardware store and ask for 4 inch long replacements. 
662,"I would not leave an option for them to stay until they find something: they will exploit that kindness, and not move for a very long time.

Just lay it out for them. We terminated our lease as of DATE, by then we will all have to move out.

I wouldn't even ask for help or anything with cleaning or moving from them. Give them a date all their stuff must be out for cleaning, else it will be thrown out. Do the cleaning yourself or buy the service with a ""clean guarantee"".

Be prepared to not get the last months worth of lease from them."
663,You began dating an 19 year old who you had foreknowledge suffered from PTSD and mental illness when you were 31? Big yikes.
664,"Normally you’d be right, but this situation is more nuanced than others because postpartum psychosis poses a danger to the baby. The threshold for needing examples proving direct danger (such as her staying that she is going to harm herself or others) is lower than usual.

Source: Me, a psychiatrist with experience in the psychiatric emergency room. Even just based on the details of this post, I think it’s likely that I would end up certifying this person if the evaluation and collateral were all consistent."
665,"Yeah, pills can be great but it's typically a bit of a bandaid without therapy. If she keepa being difficult about pills... She could at least goto therapy. I don't see how getting married would be a good idea right now"
666,"OP, as other have said this is NOT “simply” PPD. This looks like full blown PP Psychosis. This is extremely dangerous and can end up with your baby harmed or killed. When new moms seemingly randomly kill their babies, a lot of times it’s usually Psychosis. If you have any way to get her committed, even involuntary, you NEED to get her help. Your baby’s life and your wife’s life are at stake here. It’s a medical emergency. I don’t think a simple doctors appointment will do much, she needs inpatient help ASAP. A job is a job and you’ll figure it out, your family comes first. "
667,"I think it is pretty clear what is going on. He doesn’t think he should be the reason for you to stay and this relationship isn’t not strong enough. He won’t move and he isn’t wrong. Why would anyone uproot themselves for a 7 month relationship? You shouldn’t give up your future for a 7 month relationship either. 

Sorry, you two just happen at the wrong time and place. It isn’t either one of you faults. Shit happens."
668,"As a mediocre myself, I'm guessing that she is still under the impression it's a somewhat easy path to a high-status, high-income job. "
669,"Any friends or colleagues who you could crash with? Sounds like going home might not help with your mental health as well, hopefully there’s someone you can stay with for the time being while you think about next steps. "
670,"You have a tough job. It’s impressive that you do it and do it to the best of your ability. You deserve a partner who realizes and celebrates how impressive you are. 

Here is how a mature, caring, loving partner might react to these situations.  

“Wow, that’s so stressful, that sucks.” 

“You did the best you could. You’re amazing at your job, look at all you’ve accomplished even with not enough funding.” 

“Is there anything I can do to help?” 

“You are stressed so much lately. I hate seeing how unhappy this job makes you. I don’t think you can go on like this. I’m worried about you, is there anything you can do to change your situation?” 

“I’m sorry but I can’t handle your stress right now. Can we spend some alone time and then talk again after dinner?” 

Your boyfriend sound so painfully immature. He’s annoyed that you have stress and feelings. He wants the annoying thing to end, so he swats at your problems like they are a fly. He’s not actually listening to you. 

You can try to teach him how to support you, but it’s not your job to teach him. You could find a much better man out there who appreciates you, the work you do, and supports you in your career. "
671,"This also happened to me, except I was older and already moved out so I didn’t have to decide where to live. But I started having these memories come back to me right before they went through a divorce. I didn’t tell a soul at first, but learned so much the o lot confirmed what I was remembering when the dust was all stirred up. 

OP, I am NOT a psychologist and I highly recommend talking to one. But I do know that sometimes our mind buries things to protect us, but our bodies/subconscious remember. 

I felt the EXACT same way around my dad growing up, from a young age, and even experienced the same guilt. Don’t jump to conclusions but or freak out, but please consider talking to a professional about this. "
672,"You have an EIGHT MONTH OLD BABY.

You met this woman five months ago?  So, you mean when your wife was 12 weeks post-partum?

And you’re complaining she “let herself go” before and after the baby?

Dude, you just had a baby together.  Of course she’s having trouble going to the gym and getting back in shape.  Of course you’re not going out as much or dressing up fancy.  And then you meet this woman, with no kids, who you see dressed up in your nice professional office every day where there’s no diapers, no fights about feeding times, no mean ol’ wife who probably wants you to do chores and help out around the house more.  Of COURSE that seems more appealing, and so instead of being a responsible adult and dealing with the hard stuff of life you’re indulging in an escapist fantasy.

Let me set you straight.  My ex did this exact same thing. Struck up a secret relationship with an old (married) high school flame, got her a job at his office, and finally decided to run off together when our kid was nine months old.  Let me tell you how it worked out.  He now never sees his kid anymore because I had to move five states away (back with my parents) because the stress of being a full-time single mom with a full time job was too much to deal with on top of my marriage dissolving ata snap of his fingers.  He couldn’t be bothered to spend time with his kid because he was too invested in focusing on Miss New Thing and missed out on some of the most amazing moments of his kid’s life (first steps, first words, first foods, etc).  Eventually Miss New Thing got bored and moved back with her husband.  Now, he sends me long emails and late night texts about how lonely he is, how sad he is about fucking up his life, and how he wants to just go back to how things were...but it’s been three years now and I’ve moved on.

Do you want that to be you?  Then get your head out of your butt, focus on your kid and your marriage, and sort yourself out tout suite."
673,"I was too immersed in the depression to be able to objectively understand what was happening. For me at the time, the unhealthy thoughts were real. I really wanted to be dead.  I didn’t understand it was PPD until later. "
674,"Relax, he’s given no detail, his father just lost his wife (if still married at the time) and this change in behavior may be attributed to that, and not him coming out after hiding his true self. You just don’t know, the education isn’t helpful now, and no vitriol has been shown by OP. I’d leave it. "
675,"I often heard voices telling me I was a terrible mother and would never be good enough and that I should just give the baby up for adoption. Actual voices. Also, I was convinced if my son fell asleep he was going to die of SIDS so I would stay up for days at a time to watch him sleep. It was a hard time."
676,By definition he's not in an ethical open relationship if he's tricking people into participating.
677,"I think that the best option if you don't want divorce (because GURL dating is HELL) is to focus on what you have instead of the spark. 

You have security. 

You have acceptance and understanding. 

You have fidelity, loyalty and commitment.

You have the freedom that comes from knowing you got someone at home waiting for you, so you can take risks like trying new hobbies, or expenses that you might not otherwise if single. 

You have history. 

You have intimacy. 

Spark is super over-rated. You're remembering it with rose-colored brains. It's not butterflies in the stomach, it's chainsaws. It's d*ck pics from drooly online jerks. It's someone who is *perfect* for you turning out to be a weirdo, racist, the ""wrong"" political party, or someone who chews with their mouth open. It's great sex that slowly tapers off and then BOOP a pr0n addiction surfaces. 

It's great sex but he's...[fill in the blank trait that is a deal breaker]. It's deciding if you can live with a smoker, drinker, gamer, pr0n user, drug user, cheater, baby daddy dude, divorced dude, criminal, much younger or older guy, or any number of ""wow, can I *really* do this?"" attributes because you're really into him but you're seeing red flags.

It's falling for a guy only to get ghosted. It's a promising thing that ends when he gets reassigned, he gets back with an ex, or meets someone else. It's screaming matches and tears and then passionate sex and then walking on eggshells and writing in to r/relationships a year later ""I feel like I can't do anything write but I loveeeeeeee himmmmmm"". It's feeling like you can't eat or sleep because you're so scared to lose him. It's questioning every day if you did the right thing to feel a few moments of ""high"" from novelty. 

In short: don't do it. 

"
678,So... the real problem is that you are in a bad relationship. 
679,this seriously sounds like the plot of a horror movie. 
680,"He got fired a few months ago and hasn't gone and found a new job? Note, I said job, not career. There are jobs. There are tons of jobs, it's a great job market. 


"
681,"'is there something i can do?'


yeah. break up with her. she clearly has ZERO respect for relationship boundaries if she keeps 'putting' herself in these positions. this is not someone you want to be tied to for the rest of your life. it will just keep happening.

also, i'd bet $1000 that if you were to start getting drunk and kissing girls, she'd have a HUGE problem with it."
682,If something happens during his trip your insurance may not cover damages or repairs. 
683,"Man, I hate to break this to you, but her soul-crushing depression has already blown a huge hole in your relationship.  It really sounds like you're at a breaking point.

It sounds a lot like you are assuming (some) responsibility for her mental health and well-being.

There's probably nothing you can do to make her not cry about this, but she really needs to hear you out.  You can't control her reaction.

This is only going to get worse without some sort of wake up call.  She's already rejecting professional treatment that has a good chance of helping her.  If you marry her and she continues down this path of mental self-destruction, she's going to take you with her.  You don't need to sacrifice yourself to her depression.  Postponing the wedding is protecting yourself at this point, as it is much easier and cheaper to separate now than if you're married (yes, even given the amount of time you've been together).  Also could be the wake up call she needs to understand that letting this go unchecked is driving the person she loves out of her life and down his own road of depression.

I'm not telling you to leave her right now.  But it sounds like you are internalizing how much of an effect this has on you because you're afraid of the effect that knowledge has on her.  Being honest with her about that may help you two work through this.  

Let her know you aren't going to leave her now, just postponing the wedding to protect yourself at this point.  Also let her know that you don't want to leave her, that you love her and want to help her, and want to be there to support her, but you aren't going to spend the rest of your life in misery because she refuses to get treatment (therapy, medication, self-help, whatever form it is).  It's gonna be really hard to keep yourself from becoming a mess during this conversation, but try not to sell your own self short here, because you won't be doing her any favors."
684,"There's two different factors going on here, and I think that neither one of them is *inherently* a problem, but either *could* be a problem or become one. 

Firstly, it's pretty common for men to view orgasms as the ""goal"" of sex - there's physical, cultural, biological, and a whole host of other reasons why this is a fairly prevalent belief, but the concept of ""sex can feel good even if someone doesn't 'finish'"" is one that takes a lot of guys some time to learn. An aside, but I'll even point to the phrasing of the euphemism ""finish"" as an example of how prevalent this belief is!

Some other commenters have mentioned this, but if your boyfriend is unwilling to consider this viewpoint and begins *pressuring* you to orgasm, this is a bad, bad sign. At the same time, it's not *necessarily* a big red flag that he would view orgasms as an important aspect - if he's never had reason to think about ""sex without orgasms can still be pleasurable"", he'd never had the opportunity to challenge his belief. I'm just saying this so that you know to be aware, but not to treat ""he is worried he can't get me off"" as an inherently dangerous mindset. 

The second avenue is also related to the first, but it delves into some of the more vulnerable areas of sex and intimacy. I think that it's absolutely okay to ask a partner what they like, and to suggest that they explore themselves in order to make your mutual sex life more enjoyable, but this still runs the risk of going into the above scenario where your orgasm becomes a ""goal"" rather than just something nice that might or might not happen. 

The ""next level intimacy"" makes me wonder if there's a bit of a mismatch in how each of you are perceiving sex - I might be reading a little bit too much into your post below, but this quote:

&gt; I have felt close to an orgasm during sex with my boyfriend but I’ve never actually been able to “let go” I guess. 

Makes me *wonder* if there's aspects of sex or intimacy that you're either afraid of or uncomfortable with? I am definitely not saying this as an attack on you, but *if* this is true *and* your boyfriend is picking up on this discomfort, then he may be somehow turning it into a thing about orgasms specifically when it's actually about ""how can we both be more comfortable and enjoy what happens"". 

You've mentioned your boyfriend was upset, so keep an eye open that he doesn't try to pressure you into anything or otherwise get sulky over sex, and have the conversation about how sex can still be pleasurable even without a specific orgasm - but at the same time, keep an open mind and consider whether or not there might be some ways you can get more comfortable with sex, even putting ""orgasms"" aside entirely. "
685,"As a two time sufferer of PPD I’m really concerned your wife has crossed the line to postpartum psychosis. If that is the case, she likely has no insight into what is happening right now. With PPP, both mother and baby are in danger. Have you spoken to her family about your concerns? You might have to proceed with some sort of involuntary commitment and it will be so much easier to have her family (or close friends) support in this."
686,No they're not like that at all. They've had a pretty healthy relationship as long as we've been together. 
687,"OP if you can fit in XL maternity clothes I have some winter tops I can send you. 

I’ve been there. My husband is active duty military and we moved away from all family support when my daughter was 2 months old. I’ve experienced the isolation. Not having friends and living paycheck to paycheck. 
The tops aren’t the most up to day in fashion. But warm. 

PM me if you’re interested. "
688,"&gt;They are understandably angry about it, since she was not going to get a surprise party because of my little mistake.

1) Not understandable. You didn't make a mistake in assuming your girlfriend wouldn't snoop in your phone.

2) Is the party for your gf or them? Because your GF doesn't want a surprise party.

3) Let her go, she's not worth being treated like this."
689,"Yeah it's fucking creepy! It's super, extra crispy creepy! Does he use this BS to justify his own actions, too? 

*Shudder*"
690,"So you're telling me that you have experience in your dream job and your close friends are all in that industry, perfectly placed for networking and helping you get back in? That jealousy is just your heart pushing you to do something about your dream, and your friendship group could be seriously helpful with that."
691,Dude seriously this isn’t the right time for this. OP has more pressing shit going on at the moment. It sounds like OP’s dad has a lot more going on than just transitioning and that is what OP is referring to when he says his dad has mental illness.
692,"Why? Because you don’t like to speak with people without a wing person? Look I get it does help grease the wheels to have someone good at this with you at such professional or networking events, but in order to be successful you really need to be able to go solo too.

She behaved selfishly and abominably and should have been way more supportive of you, but you also need to learn to stand on your own to feet."
693,"I don't even think its about whether he'll go to couple's counselling - I think it's savable if and only if he is willing to take responsibility for his decision to move his family with no gameplan and work hard alongside her to help put things right before their baby is born.

I agree about consulting with her doctor/s as well, though, to see if there's anything safe in the short term to help her get through this super stressful situation. If they can afford the extra bill for medications / have coverage, anyways. I have no idea about how medical care works in the states, I just know it's often more expensive than it is where I live in Canada."
694,"Eeesh.  I see your side, I really do... But... I agree with your husband... And I'm sorry that I do.

Good luck. "
695,The only thing you're doing wrong is staying with your current GF. This is a stunning lack of empathy
696,Very good point about taking baby out of state after birth. You’ll be stuck.
697,"I'm fairly certain him taking his phone and then making it a point of saying ""You're going to snoop"" is textbook projection. I'm willing to bet he is cheating. My gf would never look through my phone because I know she trusts me. But if I ever were to leave my phone unattended, I would have no problems if she were to get on the phone for whatever reason she needed to. "
698,"You have a college degree, you’re in a stable relationship, you have a good job, you’ve done more than many people in your shoes could accomplish. If possible, consider moving to another city of town with your bf. If your dad goes to trial your life will get much harder. You don’t need to be around that or have to witness it. It’s not fair to you or healthy.  Consider using your moms maiden name, especially online. And yes, seek therapy, you’re not dealing with easy stuff, you need to focus on what’s best for your future. Good luck."
699,"His truck could be 50 years old and fine for roadtrips, if it were maintained well.   Not having a well-maintained vehicle are choices he's made.  Deciding to go on a road trip with a vehicle that can't handle it is another.

Do NOT let him take your car."
700,Same thing I said in another comment: even the greatest glass of wine is made undrinkable with the tiniest amount of dog shit. His lack of respect for you and the fact that he purposefully tells you things to make you feel insecure is enough to be dog shit in most relationships. There are plenty of guys out there that will be supportive of you and your goals and not make you feel like shit about yourself at the same time. 
701,"Did you see the part where she says if she doesn’t get her way she panics and freaks out? Talk about a cop out for acting like a toddler with a temper tantrum. She’s sounds like a spoiled brat who wants everything her way because it’s her birthday party. I’ll bet no one will ever go out of their way to surprise her again, she’s completely ungrateful. I’ll bet she turns into one of those crazy bridezillas that tells each person what to buy for gifts and all of it will be outrageously priced and frivolous. "
702,"I don't think her husband is willing to work as a team. 

OP I think you should move back home and have your child with your support system while seeking help for your mental health. PTSD is no joke especially worh a baby on the way and an unsupportive husband. 

Move back home for yourself and baby."
703,"The sexual parts of a relationship are very important to many people.  A lot of couples break up solely due to sexual incompatibility, so I would try to talk with him and find some way that you both can be happy with the physical part of your relationship"
704,"He seems to be getting cocky over his increased income. Talk to him about it. He shouldn’t be chatting about it to his mates and laughing about you not having the income to buy things for yourself. It’s childish and petty. 

If he is your lifelong partner he should want to see you have things that you need like a tetanus booster. To say things like, ‘I’m not paying for that’ is so incredibly selfish. Does he care about your well-being? It shouldn’t even have been a question, he should have hands down paid for it and as a worse case scenario you could progressively refund him the amount (which I personally think is dumb, because the two of you are supposed to be in a loving relationship, though I know that can differ from couple to couple). 

Bottom line, he needs to get his ego in check. I wouldn’t be okay with staying in a relationship where I felt that my partner, no matter the income discrepancy, felt we weren’t complete equals. 

Side note: I am also in a relationship where I make roughly 5 times my partners income. In the relationship, we both make important money decisions together and I wouldn’t bat an eyelash at buying him or his kids the things they need. "
705,I don't find that funny. That sounds terrifying. I'm so glad you got help.
706,"&gt;I stated that we don’t know what will happen until we try and brought up our promise.

OP is willing to risk it, which is a huge gamble considering the stress that her family and marriage are under already."
707,"I feel for Tracey, she’s putting effort in to make her partner James happy with whatever makes him happy. 
I know plenty of women who would be going down the “she’s not even your child! Why are you spending so much time with your ex and a child that’s not even yours!!” Jealousy route.

"
708,"Yes, like paralegal ? Also a lot of people fall in love with their idea of what a job entails rather than what the job actually is. Movies paint a very unrealistic view of what lawyers or doctors do. "
709,"OP has apparently dated a worse guy in the past... hence, she thinks that her current fiancé is a great person....

She has no idea what healthy looks like and due to her insecurities, she'll probably just stay with him no matter what"
710,Is the rest of your relationship OK? This is so insanely insensitive of him!
711,"&gt; I just said ""This isn't working for me"" and what has ensued has been this big mess of him and our friends victimizing him and painting me as this frigid b---- who would have the audacity to dump someone because he's struggling. 

Yeah that’s when you turn on your I-don’t-give-a-fuck-ulator and crank it up to 11. 

You broke up. His friends’ opinions don’t matter anymore. HIS opinions don’t matter anymore. I know it sucks to think that there are people in the world who think ill of you for unjust reasons, but them’s the breaks. You’ll forget them all in due time and move on with your (happier) life. 

For what it’s worth, one of my ex’s “friends” (99% certain they jumped in bed together as soon as I left) took it upon herself to *scold* me for dumping him, and proceeded to write a truly bananas message in which he was simultaneously devastated and heartbroken over the breakup but also “doing like, SO great without me.” She got blocked. The breakup remained a breakup. It changed nothing. *Because her opinion is irrelevant.* She did not know what really went on in our relationship, and never will, knowing my ex. And life’s too short to try explaining it to someone who has already decided you’re the bad guy. Thank you, next."
712,"I may catch some heat for this, but there may be value in plausible deniability.  If for example if you continue to the point where you're 100% committed to each other romantically, you can still tell the world that you're ""just roommates"" - and good friends.  People who love you and care about you will be happy for you, and they'll respect your privacy.

The other side of this is that the age difference really is significant, and it may simply be easier to get past some of those differences if you keep things more in the moment - instead of worrying or planning for what's going to happen in the future."
713,"In sorry, but i think your husband is right, and beyond that, kids are kind of just one of those no compromise zones - if one person doesn’t want one, you don’t have one. "
714,"If you want to move on you need to stop associating with her.  If that means you can't be her friend anymore, so be it.  If that means you avoid some social activities where she will be present, so be it.  You obviously still have feelings for her and those feelings aren't going to go away while you're still seeing her and being around her.  If  you want to move on you need to cut her out of your life."
715,Freelance artist here. In no situation would I expect my husband to do my networking/marketing.
716,"Your father has nothing to do with how your grandparents spend their money. 

You also can’t expect your father to ask on your behalf. 

If you want help from them ask for it directly and skip over your father. 

If I were you I’d ask for a loan with a low interest rate from them versus just give me money please. 

Tell them your plan and how you plan to pay them back and also present it to them in writing like a contract. 

Showing them you have a plan and the finances worked out as to how and when you will pay them back will go a long way. 

People who stand between you and your future are there to help you figure out ways to get to your future by going through, over, around, and even without them. 

It’s your job to figure out a way. Asking for help is still a great solution but you have to ask and you have to make good on your promises. "
717,"He’s “playfully” testing boundaries. If this is how he is early on, it’s only gonna get worst. Block and run. "
718,"Yeah, it's REALLY shockingly not hard for most guys to figure out how to fuck a woman in a way that she'll enjoy as long as he wants to and she doesn't have a medical condition."
719,For most people I know 2 months is a really long time to not kiss the person you are dating. Is there a religious or cultural reason?  I think you really need to talk to her and find out what her issue is. Is it a power trip of some kind? Is she afraid of sex? Unless you are okay with a physically passionless life I would either leave or investigate her reasons more and see if they are valid to you. 
720,Right? Sounds like he went way above and beyond and these leeches want more. Gross. 
721,"I don't live in Denver, but somewhere more expansive and the options for teachers here are:

\-rent a room

\-have a partner with a higher paying job

\-have lived here for long enough that your housing is more affordable (rent control or a family-owned home)

The idea of getting housing in a more affordable area and commuting can help but honestly most people I know who do that are still renting rooms or living in family homes. "
722,"When someone cheats on you they absolve you of any and all obligations to break up ""nicely""."
723,"Does snooping show a lack of trust? Yes.

But you should trust your gut, or at least investigate your gut feeling.

"
724,"i know it’s gross. i grew up in a really neglectful home and me and my brother both had really bad hygiene growing up. now his hygiene is great, and mine is good too except my i often neglect my teeth. hard to break those habits... :("
725,"You could also ask why she wants to be a prosecutor. If she doesn’t like reading or speaking in public, it’s hard to tell why."
726,"This might be unpopular opinion, but I would not say amything and checked his search history. Not only porn, but also forums, comments, likes, the whole thing."
727,"That’s why I haven’t yet, but I feel really frustrated when he says I should deal with any problems at my job the same way he does with his, and when he doesn’t have any empathy when I’m having a bad day, because he has no problems handling stress he feels at his job. I don’t know how to express that without being a jerk. "
728,Spot on. 
729,"Stayed with a guy due to sunk cost fallacy. Getting out of said relationship now, after 20 years. At least 10 years after I should have. Don't do it. I know it's scary to leave the only person you've been with in your adult life. ""What if he's the one?!"" ""What if I never find anyone I work with as well as I do him?!"" But those are the wrong questions. It should be ""What if I find someone sooo much better for me? And I wonder why I spent so much time with my ex?"" Because that often happens.

Your guy is uncertain and wishy washy about your future together. You want someone that can't imagine his life without you in it, and can't wait to build your future together. I know its hard, but it sounds like your current relationship has run its course. I'm sorry."
730,"“I need you to seriously listen to what I’m saying as it comes from a place of love. I am unhappy because you’re unhappy. Your unhappiness is seeping into our relationship and, as it stands, I don’t see how we can continue with this pattern. I think we should put wedding plans on hold until we sort this out so we can truly have happiness on that day and every day following.” She needs to know the severity of what you’re thinking, and how her reluctance for treatment has affected you. Maybe that’s the push she needs. "
731,They are renters. Not sure of their lease situation. 
732,"Jesus, this guy sounds like a massive asshole. "
733,"I have a Mother in law like this. It is never her fault. She always has a new job and a new man and is always getting better,but always with our love always with our support and always with the coda that her self worth and self harm are our responsibility. Be safe and good for you. It is not your fault or your responsibility. Do what you can do, but keep your boundaries firm. You can’t change them, you can only control how you deal with them. Much love and support to you. "
734,"This is speculation OP, but PLEASE lawyer up and cover your bases, because the things you've written contain a lot of what I see as enormous red flags for how he will behave in any potential custody situations. Just as I'm assuming you didn't know he had it in him to put you in the situation you're currently facing, DON'T assume you'll know how he'll act if/when you guys split up. Assume the worst, hope for the best."
735,"Thank god, a voice of reason. This is so entirely bizarre."
736,The creepiness and poor teaching skills should be more than enough for you to switch teachers
737,"That’s the thing, 50% of people who get it have no distinguishing risk factors. So anyone can get it. The other 50% are people with psychotic and mood disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, etc.) and people with a family history of PPP or psychotic/mood disorders. It happens more often for your first baby than subsequent births. 

"
738,"Wow, it looks *exactly* like something my first college boyfriend would wear. Are 19 year old men Just Like That?"
739,"I keep seeing paralegal repeated as a possible option but that's like telling someone who can't cut it as a doctor to just be a nurse. Being a paralegal is a challenging job that requires intelligence and a high skill set that includes researching abilities, writing abilities, public speaking/being able to interact with the public, etc. 

Just based on how OP described her I do not think she is capable of becoming a paralegal."
740,"Apparently he acted like a ‘de-facto dad’ for 3 years. I dunno what that means but to me it sounds like OP’s skirting the issue that he had a parental role with the child, otherwise why not just say he was never a parent to her. Sounds like he was in her life for 3 years acting as a parent even if it wasn’t in name. The switch out of that role would be hard for a 4 year old to understand, especially if he still looks after her occasionally."
741,"  I know talking is key to a healthy relationship. And I’ve tried communicating with her. Every time I do she either tells me that she has everything under control, or that everything is just too hard right now and she’ll be fine but she just needs a little time off. But she’s got so gone through extremes of crying and screaming. And just apathetically laying around in her bathrobe and doing absolutely nothing. The entire time I’ve known her and she had worked in a career that paid her more than it paid me. And I just find somebody  laying around doing nothing to be so unattractive  no matter how pretty she is. 

 I’m afraid if I push the subject of talking to her before the 31st that I will be caught in a real bind. Because part of me is now is concerned that she’ll run off without paying anything at all. And while I can do it by myself I would be extremely tight. "
742,"exactly. I'd prefer for him to have a job and be making at least equal to what his wife earns, for his ego and also for the benefit of the family unit. But the situation of mom/wife being the primary breadwinner would have been *temporary*. It would have supported them long enough for him to find a job, and it would have given them a safety net for her to have a healthy and calm pregnancy. 

I'm all for a man being responsible and wanting to pull his weight financially, but that's *not* what this guy was doing. And the fact that he *lied* to her about having done his research and having a plan makes it even worse. Sometimes, plans don't work out. That's life. But he just took a chainsaw and ripped apart their lives and their marriage. And for what? 

I think there were probably red flags there from the first few weeks of dating this guy, but the OP likely didn't recognize them due to her history of abuse and PTSD. That's not her fault. But now that the signs are too big to ignore, I hope she learns her lesson and leaves him. At least until he's truly learned his lesson and has done a *ton* of work on himself to earn back her trust. It's unlikely he'll change, though. She's going to have to accept that this is who he is, move on with a life of her own and protect herself and her child as best she can. "
743,"Honestly he sounds like an ass. You are married not dating. If you keep separate accounts as a choice (believe me, if I ever got remarried I would) that’s fine but this is some seriously controlling passive aggressive behavior on his part. 

It’s not you and I’d be pissed if anyone treated me like this.

Not sure where you live and laws accordingly but lots of places have shared community assets law for divorce. I’d be tempted to remind him of that at this point.  "
744,You are being selfish here and it is not your place to try and force your father to ask his parents for money if he doesn't want to ask them for money. My guess is your dad has very good reasons to not have a good relationship with his parents and you are risking your relationship with your dad by going behind his back to ask for this money. Time to figure things out by either working to save the money you need or taking out loans to go to school. 
745,"The friends should butt out. Everyone's relationship is different. My husband and I don't even wear wedding bands at all, doesn't bother me that he doesn't and I never even wanted a ring. 

Aside from which, wearing a ring doesn't stop people from cheating. Trust should be in the person not the ring. "
746,"She doesn't like to study though, so she wouldn't be cut out for that. Paralegals have to help with a lot of research and writing AFAIK"
747,"That's a great and more perfect analogy because, as silly as it sounds to some, it was one of a kind and irreplaceable and (the silly part) I get pretty into role-playing stuff so I've felt like I was really on a pilgrimage of sorts playing this hard but beautiful game and when I found that weapon it felt great to use and something *clicked* mechanically so, I got a bit sentimental about it in a humorous way (as such, your analogy is perfect).   


I reckon I should have put this in the OP, but I do really think that she inherently does respect boundaries and is generally empathetic/listens and respects my wishes in this realm. I think this situation is unique in that, a big trait/quirk of hers (which I actually adore about her) is that she's extremely passionate and borderline obsessive about puzzles and mysteries. So like, if she's listening to some true crime podcast like 'Serial' or watching 'Making a Murderer' she will want to figure that shit out like *no tomorrow* to the point where we'll be talking about politics or something and she'll suddenly go 'OH MY GOD X LIKED THIS CANDYBAR WHICH U CAN BUY FROM Y SHOP WHICH WAS NEAR THE MURDER SCENE AHHHH I BET IT WAS HIM'. Even if she can't figure out where a quotes from immediately she will refuse to google it and halfway through a movie she'll all of a sudden go 'I GOT IT IT'S FROM CATCHER IN THE RYE!'. So, this extremely vague puzzle of a quest line (and other quest lines throughout the game) have gotten to her at this level. I think that's why she opened my save and sold whatever just to solve it- honestly I woulda been more annoyed if she actually did solve a story thing on my save without me there but, long ramble short I am 99% sure that this was her driving force.   


And because I understand that, if she'd said 'oh shit I'm really sorry, I didn't know I just really wanted to solve it' I would have told her it's completely fine and not to worry, and maybe proposed stating a new save with her so she can solve all the mysteries :P Obsessive trait or not, I don't want to say sorry to my now angry girlfriend for going against my reasonable request. "
748,"My friend was once at a party, with alcohol, and this girl asked him to pass her a blanket she had been using from the couch. He grabs the blanket and when he lifts it up her phone flies out of the folds and the screen cracks. Omg Im so sorry what an unfortunate accident yada yada. It could have ended there but she tried to blame him for the phone and get him to pay for a screen replacement. He refused and for a week they fought back and forth until she finally hands him a receipt for $90 that she expects him to pay. He obliged and the next day dropped off an envelope with $90 in Monopoly money at her doorstep. They haven’t spoken since lol."
749,"Even with a history of bad spending on her part, it would be logical to do it the other way around, of course paying for the doctor but letting her get the cheaper bra as a consequence of poor choices. He sounds sorta toxic, with all his macho jokes and expectations."
750,"My actual involuntary out-loud reaction when googling: /Loud gasp ""Oh nooo!""

It was worse than what I was imagining."
751,Trust your gut girl. Don’t downplay your reactions to stuff like this. Talk to another adult about this if you can and also go to a professional.
752,This. Block him and move on. He sounds like nothing but a dead weight. 
753,"I'm sorry but your girlfriend very obviously has no respect for you.

What fufills you about this relationship?  Looking in as an outsider what would you tell a friend or a child of yours who one day finds a relationship like this?  

I think you need to reevaluate the relationship.  Your girlfriend is emotionally abusive. "
754,"Ugh, how could they???? I'm so sorry. And I know it's not kosher around here, but I'm glad you punched him in the face.

I would continue to ignore, personally. I think that one message telling her to stop harassing you is a fine option too, but dont let those flood gates open. She is probably looking for any reaction at this point."
755,"The guys who won’t take “no” for an answer won’t take silence as a “no.” 

If you’re afraid he’ll harass you if you tell him you’re not interested, recruit some (wiser) friends to hang out with you when you know he’ll be around. If he harasses you online or over text, tell your parents. Protecting you is still their job. This guy is legally an adult and you are nowhere near. If you need help, ask for it. "
756,"I realize we don't know anything else about your husband, but this does not paint him in very good light. Your mother left the room crying and he apparently is a cruel enough person to not care and still find this funny. And you're upset about it too, his own wife upset about her own parents, and he's completely indifferent to your feelings as well and keeps joking about it? Also the fact that you would suspect him of setting your dad up to hurt your mom is super telling that you think your husband is a shit guy. As in, nice guys don't do that shit. 

Is your husband normally some sort of considerate emphatic person? Your father fucked up while drunk by letting his crush slip and that's bad. But your husband is an asshole while sober. I feel way worse for you then your mom. "
757,You should talk to your landlord and also follow up with CPS if you can. If you think either of them are a real threat it wouldn't hurt to start a paper trail. Ignore them to the best of your ability. 
758,"What about getting a long-term Air BnB? You could go back, have time to regroup, meet with friends and reconnect with people you know from St. Louis.

Also, does your degree offer any freelance options?"
759,"Did I write this? Am I you? I really understand where you are coming from. To piggyback off another comment: if there is no chemistry, that’s a sign. You’re clearly compatible, but there’s a difference between compatibility and real chemistry. It’s also evident that you’re not looking for someone to fulfil most of your every day needs (you mention being happy at work, you have friends, etc.) which indicates you’re possibly not sure where someone could fit in your life. The thing is, if you want someone around you, you’ll make time. If you care about someone, you’ll make it work. I’m sure you do care about this person as a person, but maybe not romantically. That’s okay. But it’s better to be honest about how you’re feeling. If you’re unhappy or unfulfilled, you need to address that with her, quite simply because she is clearly happy and fulfilled with you, and if you’re not there with her, problems will arise later. It sounds like you’re also maybe getting bored, or you get bored easily? Or you feel unchallenged by this person. The answer is clear: find someone who does challenge you. You’ll make it work if you really care."
760,Your mistake is being with someone you can’t trust to not go through your phone.

lol"
763,"&gt; **She played on my save ... even though I told her to not play on my save**  

You specifically asked her not to do it and she did it anyway. Relationships require the people in them to respect boundaries. The fact that this instance involves a video game is irreverent, don't listen to people who tell you otherwise. Yes, you have a right to be peeved and she is being immature. Don't let this experience ruin your fun with the game though, you have the right to enjoy it still. "
764,"Wow, negotiate on their behalf? That's... Speechless."
765,"Yes I agree. Plus there’s nothing wrong with extending the engagement till you work it out. But all marriage does is magnify whatever’s there. If you’re happy, marriage magnifies that happiness, however if it’s bad, marriage only makes it that much worse."
766,"I kind of think you should trust your gut on this one. If you feel like it's happening, I think that's enough to politely back out and find someone who you don't suspect of checking out young girls.

I know ""end the relationship"" isn't probably what you're asking for, but there was a ""just found out my lifelong friend was arrested for child porn and it turned out it was a video of him and his daughter"" post the other day that was just devastating. If you rationalize away these suspicions now and it turns out he's a predator..."
767,"Aw buddy, yeah that's a killer weapon and you're right that it's the only one. So that means you're scaling to dex and if my assumption that you're running a fairly light dex build is correct, if you have the Uchigatana or Ricard's Rapier start levelling that (as you should get another slab if you're paying this much attention to extra content, idk where you're at in the game exactly). If you don't have either of those, the Painting Guardian Sword is an easy drop from some enemies and that'll scale well. Don't let this break your game if you're that close, brother! "
768,This post is useless without pictures. 
769,"This isn't really the time for this topic. Focus on the problem, not a part of OP's life they gave marginal detail on. For all you know the mental illness has nothing to do with being trans. You're just lecturing someone who needs actual help. "
770,"&gt;well, even with all that, he might be a woman. for some people it takes a major life event or just older age to realize this. of course you can have dysmorphia without necessarily being trans, and he should seek therapy, but it is kind of inhumane to doubt what he says just because your mother passed and he's now ""doing drugs"" or something.

Did you even read his comment? I think he knows his own father better than you. His father is quite clearly going through extreme mental health issues of his own. He's not just doing ""some drugs"". 

It's ironic that you're calling him inhumane for ""doubting"" his father while at the same time completely disregarding his *entire comment* because you think you know better. "
771,"Woah. I read through this assuming this was her boyfriend, which made it slightly more understandable (although even with a close friend, I'd at least offer to lend them the money). I don't think this guy understands the meaning of a marriage, it's a lifelong partnership."
772,What did he say when you asked him why he has no photos of you? 
773,"Agreed! It's her family, her sister. She should handle it, not ask him to put himself in an uncomfortable position. Honestly, provided that they (his wife and her parents) knew the sister's academic track records, her GPA and LSAT, what kind of a student she is, I see no reason why they have to ask him to be blunt and Frank. Why can't they see it for themselves? A quick google search would tell you the qualifications required for law school. Why do they also need to be disillusioned, and why does that burden have to fall onto OP?"
774,"It’s not normal for a fully grown man to be checking out 13 year old girls, dude. "
775,"It’s very kind of you to assume positive intent. 

Interesting that this complaint, not ever cited by anyone else in your life even when questioned, even your doctor, friends, exes who owe you no kindness, is only addressed by your partner when he was called out of his own lack of oral hygiene. 

It’s possible you have bad breath. It’s unlikely. 

Best way to find out: dentist together! And your dentist, 97% chance he’s gonna tell you there are no concerns. 

Your partner is more than likely being petty and defensive. Not a good look. Get it handled, don’t be afraid to tell him that your doctor and dentist see no issue and then ask directly: did he feel put on the spot? 

Counseling likely in your future because even if he’s correct, you approached this with kindness and you were gentle. He was not. That’s not acceptable. "
776,"Your boyfriend sound like he is trying to take the moral high ground even though he is not aware of just how hard her life was at the time. I think it is ridiculous of him to start pointing fingers at you when you have done nothing but support  your friend? Your boyfriend can be bothered all he wants but he is a new relationship and Lisa is someone who has been around since high school. I would tactfully explain to him that people change and high school wasn't great for a lot of people, Lisa is a different person now and that's that, there is no reason for him not to trust her he does not have any control over the relationship you have with your friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry but I would be super pissed off if my boyfriend started questioning me just because my friend liked to fuck guys when she was in high school. "
777,Yeah I think so. 
778,"As opposed to her being financially dependent on a man who manipulated and lied to his pregnant wife in order to get her to move to a new city with no research or planning and the magical assumption that things will ""just work out""? That's okay, I guess. But not for him to be a part-time SAHD for 9 months while she pays for a certification program he wanted to take and saves up enough money to put them in a better financial situation before moving. She might even want to research the neighborhood they're going to move their family to, rash woman that she is."
779,"Yes, this is the perfect line to draw. ""I can't marry you until you start taking care of yourself"", essentially."
780,"Even if she initiated, it's still the job of the ADULT to turn down those advances because they should know better."
781,This! She'll probably appreciate that sweet gesture.
782,I got strong moron vibes from this too. He's a teacher... They dont make good money. You never follow the career of the person who makes less money in a less stable industry.
783,So he thought she was older than she was -- they always say that -- but continued to see her even after being explicitly told she was a minor? That would be break up territory for me.
784,"You’re still doing it!!! This is awful to read, stop talking about yourself as if tits and ass are all you bring to a relationship. 

By the way, nerds can be assholes, as you have discovered, and good looking jocks can be good people. And anyway you should date people you find physically attractive, that was a big part of my point. "
785,Upvoted for truthiness
786,"Considering the comments that he made towards you, I'd say your discomfort is 100% reasonable. I have the same feeling with my own father for similar reasons and after bringing it up with friends, can confirm it's totally not normal dad behavior!"
787,"It doesn't matter who is saying what to him, the way he is treating you is ABUSE.  He is laughing at you crying, calls you names, tries to control what you wear, etc.  NONE of that is acceptable and all of that is abuse.  

You need to leave him.  I doubt it's his family/friends all telling him things...I think he's just letting his true nature show now."
788,Seems like he’s pretty abusive now tbh—he’s literally hitting you and causing you pain after you ask him to stop. 
789,"At least have some kind of joint account for things like household items, bills, and medical care.  I can understand having separate accounts for personal/fun stuff, but come on, OP shouldn't have to go without a tetanus shot because she can't afford it on her own.  That's nuts.  She's married - what's the point of marriage if you won't protect and take care of each other?"
790,"Uh, you don’t have to justify messaging your best friend. Your boyfriend has some serious control issues. This would never even come up in a healthy relationship. I’d really take a look at things if he’s controlling over something so normal. "
791,"Cheating is cheating. If you don’t like being cheated on you probably should ditch her. It’s actually worse that she feels for him on an emotional level and tells you it isn’t due to a lack in your relationship. She’s dating this guy without any remorse and you’re being pretty cavalier about it. 

Oh and spoiler alert: it isn’t going to stop. It will more than likely progress. "
792,"You might find more support and better perspectives on forums for special needs parents. 

I honestly can’t see where you guys have anything left to give to another child. He’s working a ridiculous amount of hours, you’re working and doing the bulk of the childcare and getting help from him when he’s home. You’ve both got to be exhausted and hanging on by a thread. I don’t even know how you could add another person to your family.  "
793,I amazed and somewhat impressed with your boyfriends ability to lie on the fly.
794,"I wanna add, if it smells bad even after you've brushed your teeth, it could also be a bad tooth. You might not even know it, so might be worth going to a checkup. A rotting tooth often doesn't hurt and you usually don't even know it's been decaying before there's a hole in it."
795,"I would just say.... Look, I don't like walking on egg shells around here.  I was hoping we could have a great weekend together but the way you're acting it seems that it's not going to be possible.  You gave me the mark on my neck the other night.  There IS no other explanation because YOU'RE the only one that does that to me.  If you're not going to believe me and not going to talk to me then it probably makes more sense for me to go and give you some space.

If she gives you crap then you need to go.  Tell her to call you when she comes to her senses."
796,"Are we sure the friend has never washed her bra, or never machine washed it? 

OP should know if if she wore someone else’s garment that had literally never been washed."
797,"I'm relieved to hear you've sought help for her already and that your baby is somewhere safe. Keep us updated, OP."
798,"Oh, ditto. I’ve got to see if this ring is as ugly as he thinks"
799,"You know what she wants: she wants you to participate in running the household you live in.  She doesn't want to have to be the ""manager"" having to boss you, the ""employee"" around all the time, making sure you do your basic jobs as a parent and housemate.  She wants you to take initiative, see what needs to be done, and do it.

This isn't about mind-reading.  You don't need to be psychic to know what sort of tasks need to be done in your house.  How do you think she knows what needs to be done?  Does she have telepathic communications with the dishes and clutter, where they tell her that they need to be put away?  Does *she* magically intuit that the children need to have lunch?  No?  Does anyone else tell her to do it?  No?  Then how come you need to be psychic or instructed in order to know these things?"
800,"Because nobody cares who the child's parents are!! It doesn't matter to anyone but op. 

She wants it both ways. Have this dad figure, and a good one apparently, but my god, don't ever call him dad!  

Plus she was fine with some of the pics being posted, she's basically complaining about a caption on one photograph. Does that oversight really rise to the level of the national tragedy she's creating here?"
801,"Stop being ""the cool girlfriend""!

Seriously,  wtf? Not only it is inappropriate to discuss you and your SO's sex life work others,  going for ""advice"" and sharing personal conversations... ffs, it is a recipe for disaster. It is a breach of your privacy, sharing personal convos between you two with her is no better than sending your nude to somebody else.  

I am willing to bet he is in the territory of emotional cheating already. I don't want to jump on a bandwagon of ""bre ask up with him and let them have each other"", but your boyfriend needs at last a ""come to Jesus"" talk.

I, personally,  would not forgive such breach of trust. 
"
802,"Agreed, he’s just blatantly disrespecting you because he knows he can get away with it. Total asshole. "
803,"I mean...you dump this heap of garbage. He got mad at you because he is gaslighting you (if you aren't familiar with the term, basically trying to turn an issue around on you when he is in the wrong). 

Anyone who 1. Is planning to cheat and 2. Says they dont love you ""that much"" is not worth your time. 

Dont waste any more time on this guy, go find someone who is head over heels for you. "
804,That's a very good point. 
805,"From a 47-year old's perspective: life is full of ""what if""s. The longer you live the more of these kinds of big decisions you will have made along the way. What if I had chosen the other school I got accepted in? What if I'd changed my major like I briefly considered? What if I hadn't married my partner? What if we had moved to a different city? The answer is that my life would be different, but I have no way of knowing if it would have been better or worse. (I'm quite happy with it now, btw)

All you can do is base your decision on the information you have and the situation as it is right now. You have a good job offer, plus a boyfriend you haven't dated for very long and who finds his current life more important than moving to be with you. Those are the facts as they are right now. "
806,"You need to turn him down. When young women mature early they get a lot of attention that is inappropriate for their age. It can get them in trouble. Adults need to date adults, not 14 year olds. It doesn't matter how you look. If you were flat chested and looked 12, I guarantee he would not he giving you the time of day.

If he asks you out tell him no thanks and spend more time with guys closer to your age."
807,"I would not let someone I have only been seeing for 2 months borrow my car. Why is it he can't take his own anyways? And is there some kind of urgency to see his friend? Maybe he should be postponing this visit until he's in a better place.  The whole thing seems kind of weird to me and my guard would be up about it if I were you. I'd just tell him that you're not comfortable lending your car out especially since your relationship is still so new and hope he understands. If he doesn't, that would be a red flag to me. "
808,I’ve told her if she can show me how it’s ruined I’ll pay her the $35. She can put it on or show me the complete deterioration with a comparison of one she has. Show me proof and I’ll pay it. 
809,He never was daddy though. The girl has known from the beginning that he’s just james. And then mom’s friend james turned into mom’s boyfriend James and then back to mom’s friend uncle James.  
810,"And he has his own fucking car. That sounds like a 2000 km trip. Of course it's better to use her car for that. And if he crashes it, he's probably going to crash the relationship as well. "
811,"OP hasn't considered anything. Her response to all of her husbands extremely valid, well thought out, and realistic points is ""she deserves another child."" That her son deserves a sibling and they won't know what will happen until they try.

It's selfish and irresponsible. Her husband works 80 hours, then comes home and assumes all care for their child and even does so on a rare day off that he has. Her husband is going to run himself into the ground and OP wants to add more stress, more financial expenses, and risk another potential child with disability. Not to mention if they have a non-disabled child, that child will never have a normal childhood and be burdened with more responsibility as an adult for their sibling. 

She needs to accept that life didn't go the way she planned and it's heartbreaking and it's not fair, but that's what's happened. And that 80 hour work week paycheck is pretty much drained by their son's expenses and care. OP needs to face reality and get her husband some support. He's at his breaking point here. "
812,"those aren't romantic ideals, they are quips describing toxic or codependent or otherwise destructive relationships. your career cannot rely on the behavior of your gf. Your EVENING cannot either. If you tie everything else up in someone else, it absolves you off responsibility for yourself. This is all firmly your own responsibility. You don't get to pin it on her. You had a hundred options, you made your choices, you live with the consequences."
813,That is arguably the most disgusting part. He took advantage of a minor.
814,"This is a great post. 

From what I am reading, yes, objectively you have a very difficult job but I also see a lot of burnout and stress that isn't necessarily fair to place on your partner. 

I used to work in law enforcement and my spouse still does. I have an office job now. We make it a rule to never really talk about our work stress at home because it makes it worse to bring stress home. 

If there's one thing I think many younger people struggle with when they work emotionally difficult jobs, it's that they (1) bring work stress home/blur the divisions (2) expect their partner to listen too much to that stress (3) place an unfair burden on a partner to ""understand"". They cannot understand. They can emphathize but at some point, we must acknowledge that we choose high-stress careers and we are only hurting ourselves by bringing too much work stress home. 

I read ""burnout burnout burnout not separating work/home!"" all over this. "
815,Don't get sucked into playing his game. You're doing the right thing for your step-mom. Stay your course. To do so you need to mot allow yourself to be manipulated by him so go no contact with him until the lawsuit is over. 
816,"&gt; The doctor told her that she cannot promise her anything about the side effects because each body is different and that it's only 3 months so it'll pass. Plus, she kept reassuring Sophie that stuff she reads online is often exaggerated. 

Argh, this really wasn't the most sensitive way to put it. I'd consider changing to another gyno who's a bit more emphatic. "
817,"How much is he donating to her.

Let's be real, the only difference between many of the twitch girls and cam girls is the platform.

She no threat to you... But that kind of following is pretty pathetic."
818,"As a daughter, I would be creeped out if my dad said any part of my body looked good. If he told me I was beautiful that's fine, but it also should be in context. If I show him my wedding dress? Great. If I'm cooking dinner? Weird. "
819,"From what you’ve written, he’s told you that he wants you to go for the job that requires you to move, won’t move with you if you get it, won’t pursue a long distance relationship with you if you move, and might break up with you stay for him.

Just read that and ask yourself if you’re at peace with gambling your career over this relationship. "
820,"First step I would say is ask her to give her main mental health care professional permission to talk to you, and then do that. Important questions are going to be things like, what is her diagnosis, what is her treatment plan, how long has she been in treatment with you, and what is the general pattern and prognosis for people with this treatment. Are relapses or non-compliance episodes common? What can you expect? You can be completely open with your ex about what you're going to ask if that helps her, but if she's unwilling to let you talk to her doctor(s?) after she accused you of abuse in court, then...

If she says yes, see what you learn. Personally, I still wouldn't be comfortable with any reconciliation for a good long while. Maybe you can start sending emails with her (you, not the kids) or something, see if she can keep that up on a schedule, without any freakouts or weird behavior. Also, she needs to start paying child support. You might not 'need' it, but it's not for you. It's for your kids, and it's a great way to see if she is serious about this. Although, lying about you being abusive to the courts is so far down the rabbit hole, I'm not sure there's any coming back. Make sure to protect yourself every step of the way. Document, document, document, and ensure you don't let anything slip that she could use against you in court. "
821,Just break up now. If his parents ask why you can tell them.
822,"No you are not asking for too much. You just want to feel secure in this relationship, and he shouldn’t rob you of that because he has issues with being monogamous. "
823,"110% agree with you. It is a huge burden on the family, and there's no way I would bring another child into the situation unless I was able to find a group home for the disabled child. Early prenatal testing would be a must, too. "
824,"He didn't want kids 5 years ago, he didn't want kids 2 years ago, he didn't want kids yesterday, and he won't want kids in 6 weeks. He doesn't want kids. If you want kids you need to find someone else. There will be pain and heartbreak, but that's what it is. Sorry. "
825,"And also the fact that he “didn’t see” OP’s calls, but moments later had no problem seeing the delivery man’s calls. "
826,"It doesn't really matter what labels there are. He's shown you that sex with him will be fairly non-existent, if it ever happens at all, and that he's not interested in your body. These things will not change. If you do marry, his libido will not suddenly and drastically increase. Are you ok with that? "
827,"It's kind of like buckling your seatbelt; if your parents don't get you into the habit very early on, you have to actively remind yourself and it's kind of annoying to have to do."
828,Get out of toxic relationships. Life is too short. 
829,"Did you expect a teenager to have adult coping skills?  Is she doing anything to manage her illnesses?

This doesn't sound healthy at all."
830,"Completely agree with this. In school, I wanted to be/studied to be an illustrator. I’m really good at and love to draw ... but to be a full time illustrator, you have to be GREAT at drawing. By senior year, I kinda realized that I wasn’t quite achieving that Picasso level.

However, one of the other things that attracted me to illustration is my love for storytelling. I also understand all of the fundamentals of design (i.e., color, balance, how objects generally interact with one another in space), so Ive built a career in advertising. I still get to design and write and create and tell stories, just maybe not in the way I initially thought. 

I like the quote (don’t remember who said it) that says life isn’t really a path, it’s more like a jungle gym - you don’t always move in a straight line to get to where you want to be, sometimes you go upside down and/or sideways. "
831,"Okay, this is some really helpful context, thank you for sharing!

&gt;. I’m uncomfortable with talking during sex and about what I want (unless I’m drunk).

I'm not saying this as a judgment or anything, but this is making me lean towards the second of my two possible avenues - again, not against you, but discussing likes and dislikes and sharing interests is one of the foundations of a good sex life. It can be difficult if one partner worries that the other partner isn't enjoying their shared sex life, but there's no real discussion around what is and isn't working, which can allow some anxiety to grow.

&gt; I would also say that part of me is scared of how I’ll be perceived when I orgasm or what I’ll look like.

While I can't read minds, given that your boyfriend is attracted to you, I'd say ""perceived positively"" is a safe bet. Many people find that making their partner orgasm is actively arousing!

&gt;I’m also somewhat scared of sharing such an intimate moment with him. Like what if I orgasm once and then I can never orgasm again and sex is no longer as enjoyable for me. I just don’t want things to change in a bad way. 

This, I think, is probably at the core of why this has started to become an issue. Again, I'm not criticizing you, and I can't speak for your boyfriend, but I think that it's fairly likely he's picked up on this fear even if he's not fully conscious of it. 

I'm taking a bit of a leap here... I know it's just the internet, but I also just noticed your user name - how's the whole self esteem thing in general for you? "
832,"The photo wasn't the issue, at least I didn't think so. It was authorizing the publication and having it captioned as though it was their children that was the issue."

834,"Another female gamer chiming in.  First I would try being direct (when he starts narrating or spectating or telling you what to do, straight up tell him, ""I don't want to be spectated right now,"" ""I didn't ask for your advice, I don't need it, and I don't want to hear it"", etc).  If you want to keep the tone friendly and you're okay with trash talk, if he starts trashing the character you're on, tell him if he was a better player he'd get why people play that way (or just ""git gud,"" you don't have to put work into it).  It is 100% okay to be rude.  He's been extremely rude this whole time, and I promise you, it hasn't bothered him a bit.  He set the tone, so it's up to you to match it.

If he keeps doing it, unfriend him.  You're not obligated by work to spend your free time putting up with assholes, and *you know* that there are oblivious gamers out there who will lean like elephants until other people's boundaries crumble under the weight.  If he confronts you, tell him you were tired of his constant comments and negativity and just wanted to be left alone.  He'll sulk, but you have to remember, *you* aren't making things awkward at work, *he* is by harassing you in your free time.  

Trust me, it always feels like cutting off the boundary-pushing obnoxious guy is going to be the worst option because you'll have to put up with his bullshit whining about being a victim and how you're mean, but it is a *huge* relief to just cut them out and move on and the bad feeling you fear almost never manifests.  If he gives you grief about it at work, go to your superiors.  He is 100% in the wrong here, not you, and complaining to your coworkers that you won't spend extra time with him in a video game is not going to be a good look for him.

I've had a number of these guys float to the surface in Overwatch groups.  The women are always the most affected (because they're the ones getting criticized the most) and the guys are often the ones who say, ""Eh, he's annoying but harmless"" because they *aren't* getting criticized.  Nevertheless, when it comes down to a disagreement in the group, I have yet to see someone say, ""No, we'd much rather keep Whiny McCreepy around instead of someone who is actually pleasant to play with.""

The key is to *stop* caring about the feelings of someone who *actively* stomps on yours.  If you aren't going to stand up for yourself and what you want and keep being nice to keep the peace, he's going to keep taking advantage of you and trashing you to feel important.  That's not your responsibility.  Your well-being is."
835,"You let her know you were reaching out first and she was okay with it. Bam. You did absolutely nothing wrong.

That said, emotions are not things we can always predict. It sounds like she got jealous and just needs reassurance (and probably wants you to cut communication with your ex). Shouldn't be too hard to sort out. "
836,"I’m confused. Do you think your husband’s position is unreasonable? He seems to be bringing up completely rational points.

He set his boundaries. You’re going to have to decide if you rather have another kid or your husband. "
837,"To answer your question, yes you are overreacting/being an asshole. Definitely do not say anything to him, just leave him alone and move on."
838,"This girl sounds obsessed and frankly, a bit dangerous. I wouldn’t advise OP to meet with her at all. "
839,"Right. You aren't weak, and empathy is, overall, a very good thing, especially for people who don't normally elicit a lot of empathy (the elderly are treated pretty poorly in America, at least).

As you work and gain more experience and have more interactions, you will 'toughen up' OR you will realize that working with this population isn't for you, and you can find a new job."
840,"Animals are at their most vulnerable when defecating/urinating, and they recognize that about us as well.  The dog might even be trying to defend OP against predators!  Cats love hanging out in the bathroom for the same reason (and if they're like mine, they also wait and use the litter box at the exact same time so that you're vulnerable together)."
841,"I agree that you should have let her leave when she wanted to leave. While it’s clear she doesn’t respect you and clearly thought the way you were interacting with other party goers was unattractive and “desperate,” the fact that you continued to think that you “needed” her there is beyond me. You clung to a very selfish and rude person all night and prohibited yourself from helping yourself instead.

I’ve been to quite a few events like this in my line of work and I have to admit, I’m always more impressed by the person who’s a little boastful (yet down to earth) than the person who relies on the s/o who has nothing to do with their work to slip in a wingman boast on their behalf. I’d always always always rather hear it from the person who actually does the thing. You were better off bringing more colleagues and letting your girlfriend leave when she started acting like a child."
842,"I don't play Overwatch, but I've seen this dynamic play out in a LOT of different groups in the games I play.

Your mutual friend is right that Asshole is insecure as fuck, and harassing you makes him feel stronger.  But Asshole's inferiority complex has nothing to do with the game.  It's a deeper intrinsic unhappiness that he taking out on you, which is 100% not okay.

Your asshole friend's behaviour is paradoxically both personal and non-personal.  He IS deliberately singling you out -- but you can bet if it wasn't you, he'd be jumping down someone else's throat.  The rest of your friend group knows this, and they're being cowardly little shitweasels about it.  None of them are actually ""dealing with Asshole"" because *you're* the one taking the heat.  It's easy for them to ""put up"" with it because they don't actually have to do anything about it.

You ask how to deal with the situation and unfortunately, the most diplomatic solution is often to distance yourself from the group as a whole.  There's no shame in dropping a friend group, especially when they are pathetically spineless, and there are literally always plenty of other players to befriend.  It is not your responsibilty to teach any of them how to be a good friend.

The reason why there's no real diplomatic way to handle this is also part of why Asshole is singling you out.  Asshole is banking on your sense of ""social contract"" -- the obligation (especially for women, especially for *geek &amp; gaming* women) to remain polite and affable, even in the face of blatant disrespect.  Asshole likes picking on you because making you feel shitty makes him feel better, and he knows you're less likely to call out his shit.

So embrace the un-diplomacy, if you will.  You are not being rude here -- *he is* -- and your time and mental health are both far too valuable to waste on his issues.  Block him, mute him, ghost him.  Keep your work interactions as surface and professional as possible, and document everything in case you need to escalate to your boss.

Embrace the awkward.  Decline to resolve the Asshole in the room.

You don't have to drop everyone, but seriously start shopping for more friends.  It's not uncommon for groups like this to perpetually endure an Asshole rather than experience the momentary discomfort of kicking Asshole to the curb."
843,"&gt; I’m pretty sure if I leave we’ll be over.

Is that so big a loss? He already seems like he's in an exclusive relationship with his bruised ego. "
844,"It's so funny you say that- I often relate my relationship to my mother that way when talking to other people. It really is like she died. The only difference is that a totally destructive monster of a person took her place. It would have been emotionally easier on me if she had died, and I feel so guilty saying that. Ugh. "
845,"&gt;He would hit me when he's annoyed (not like beat me domestic violence type hitting, just like a smack on the head or arm or face, never bruising me or breaking anything). Sometimes he would have sex with me in a way that he knows I don't like but I let him anyway. I also think he is having sex with a co-worker but I'm not really in any position to ask him about that. Yesterday, he was watching a football game at his buddy's and I was 5 minutes late to pick him up. He was angry and when he got home he did the sex thing to me that I don't like and really rough as punishment. I'm still hurting from it today and I just can't take it anymore.

This is textbook abuse. It doesn't matter if he's not hitting you ""hard"", it doesn't matter if you're ""letting"" him do the sex thing, and a healthy relationship doesn't involve ""punishments"" at all (outside the context of consensual play). 

You absolutely should move back in with your parents. I'm sorry you're going through this. "
846,He's going to kill you if you stay. That's all there is to this to be honest. 
847,"Police officer here. Unfortunately, it's harder to force someone into care than originally thought. At least in my state, we need to see proof that the person is a harm to themselves or others (which often means they are in the act of it). Otherwise, he'll need to petition the court for an emergency 96 hour psychiatric hold. Then we can forcefully take the person to a hospital. However, calling the police will help because they'll be able to observe their behavior and do an affidavit that will help with the hold. I'm a CIT trained officer so I get sent on these calls often. Many times though I can convince someone to just speak with the paramedics and together with them, we can convince them to seek help. "
848,"You sound like you could benefit from therapy to deal with your self-esteem issues. 

Of course your friends aren't going to talk about how attractive they find you, especially in front of you. You're a taken man and it's socially unacceptable to do so."
849,"Sadly this behavior in the gaming world is everywhere, especially towards us women. I’m 28 and been playing games since 14, online and offline. WoW and COD being my favorite. When that attitude starts being directed at me, I throw it back at them or just mute when I want to enjoy the game without interaction. This may not work for you, depending on your comfort level with talking back but I’m a big time tomboy and it doesn’t bother me to be just like a guy back at them"
850,"I don't think you're in a borderline abusive relationship, I think you ARE in an abusive relationship. It's not normal to control where your spouse is allowed to go in the way that she is. You're clearly suffering and it's had a profound effect on your mental health. I'm really concerned to read that you're considering suicide. Are you able to get in touch with a doctor or counselor and find some support? If you're in the US, the suicide hotline number is 1-800-273-TALK. They might be able to help you if you're actively considering ending your life.

Secondly, I think your wife is also very unwell. This doesn't excuse her abusive behaviour at all, but do you think it's possible she's dealing with postpartum depression? I don't think it would be healthy at this point for you to try to support her, but she is the mother of your child and I imagine it's best for everyone involved if she can get some help. Does she have family you trust to explain the situation to and try to get them to support her in this?

You're really at a breaking point right now, you can't give your life to this relationship. Please get out and please get help. "
851,"It was bad enough he has the intention to cheat. But lying and saying his wife died when she didn't? That is very bad and creates some bad karma for him. 

Let us know what the wife says if she contacts you. "
852,"That last paragraph for real! I think he needs to just have an honest conversation with her about it. And come armed with a 8x10 photo of himself at his cringiest during those days as well as a big pic of himself now in his work clothes. I'm sure if she had picked out a hot pink sapphire with flanking skulls in black gold to match his badass ring she would consider changing it up too. 


Truthfully I don't see why this is such a big deal--it isn't like they are getting divorced or he is throwing it away or something. People change and marriages either evolve or die. A new ring symbolizes that. Maybe she really liked the Affliction look? Maybe she misses those days? IDK. My husband stopped wearing his ring completely after he bent it at work about six months into the marriage, so I guess I can't really relate!"
853,"Nope. When she gets in touch again, just say ""I'm not interested"" and move on. The only way to win this game is not to play."
854,"First of all-are you OK with a sexless marriage?  It's possible your BF could change/work through his childhood stuff, but it's also possible that he won't.  There are other reasons for a low libido, and perhaps he should get them checked out.  Wanting sex is not at all shallow.

I'm a sober alcoholic.  I think AA can be very helpful, but I don't believe that addiction occurs because there are drugs and alcohol, I believe it happens because of underlying issues.  For me, getting sober was the beginning, and finding high quality therapy is when I really started to heal and address the things that 'drove me to drink.'  

I wouldn't marry him until he's gotten therapy, and you have done some couples counseling."
855,"She was 14, this says nothing about her values as an adult."
856,"If you’re giving him signs that you’re in pain and he’s still continuing, maybe he’s not that great of a person? Your comfort and enjoyment should be a priority to him and if that’s not, that reflects really terribly on his character."
857,Get someone to watch your daughter and take her to the ER for an evaluation now. That is very dangerous and she needs help.  Your daughter is not safe alone with her.  Your wife is not safe alone with herself. Please go get medical help now.
858,"Rusty Yates is a horrible monster. He left the kids with her on purpose, alone, after he'd been told by multiple doctors and her family not to do it. He's the worst kind of fundamentalist garbage, and now he's found a new wife to abuse. "
859,"Read the Wikipedia article about her, it's infuriating. At one point AFTER the murders of her children, her husband still talked about having more kids with her when she got out. 

He was expressly directed by her psychiatrist not to leave her alone, but specifically planned to leave her alone for an hour every morning and evening to ""build her independence"". It was during that hour she killed the children. "
860,"Lol “testing the relationship” is bull shit. Also tinder is specifically for dating while snap chat is not. Dump his ass, he’s just trying to see if he can do better and so far he can’t. It’s only a matter of time before he cheats. If he’s not willing to give up tinder then he isn’t serious about your relationship "
861,"In my experience, you should never ignore your instincts. I have before, and I wasted a lot of time on something I knew was never going to be the way it was again. It seems as if you know what to do, since you've made this post. There's no reason to prolong your pain any longer. 

I'm sorry for your troubles, and I'm glad that your health seems to be improving. :) "
862,"OP, here’s the hard truth - there is no way for you to spin this breakup in a way that prevents her from being hurt and blaming herself. You could say all the right words and still leave her feeling blindsided and betrayed. Particularly considering her upbringing. “It’s not you, it’s me” sounds disingenuous even to people *without* trust issues. 

All you can do is be as respectful (and brief) as possible. Don’t get drawn into begging or arguing or demands for further explanations. They won’t make her feel better, and they won’t do you any favors either. Just tell her that this isn’t working for you, that you’re not in the headspace for a relationship right now, you’re very sorry and you wish her the best. What she does with that is up to her. 
"
863,"This is so true. I’ve had at least 2 friends like this in the past. Always acting like the world is against them and like they are an innocent victim - complaining about friends turning on them “for no reason” or people being mean/excluding them “for no reason”. Always having drama going on...But simply by being close to them and knowing their personalities, I knew that most of their problems were caused by their own actions (I.e. Being clingy, annoying habits, making rude or blunt comments, getting too drunk consistently, etc, etc.). Either they were painfully ignorant of the fact, or they were aware and were just twisting the stories to get sympathy. 

It is extremely unlikely that anyone who is truly “innocent” is constantly having bad things happen to them. "
864,"They’re broken up. Is he gonna keep being her father figure for years to come? What if Tracy and James become serious and get married. How would he continue to be her father figure without involving his potential future life partner?
(Not justifying anything that James and Tracy have done to overstep boundaries)

I think it’s best to stop letting James be her father figure even tho he’s known her for so long. I don’t think it’s healthy to continue this if they’re broken up. "
865,"So... time to have a serious conversation with your bf about the household work and what you need from his as a partner. Maybe write down a list of everything you do around the house to make the household run smoothly so he has an idea of just how much extra work you do. That being said, what happens if you talk with him and nothing changes on his end? Are you ok staying with him if he never helps out around teh house?"
866,"The lack of rational reasoning that allows someone to believe in these conspiracy theories is a dealbreaker for me. I know for myself that I would not be able to respect my partner as an equal in this situation and they deserve better than that. If you find that you're morally incompatible with this man, break up."
867,This! Baby comes first now.
868,"ALL of this! 

Chiming in to add:

* OPs partner seems to be seeking non-sexual intimacy with her partner. For instance, their days started out promising and then they part ways. OP recharged his batteries with breakfast and  a hike with his buddy while his partner took their kids to her mum’s. She tells me him when they get back that she is stressed and had trouble with the kids all day. She sounds emotionally drained.  She invited him into the bath with her. Yes she could be initiating sex, but for a lot of women self-care rituals are about replenishing their emotional reserves. Being invited to join in might not have been anything more than just wanting  him there to reconnect emotionally and share intimacy after a crappy day being a mum. Yes, she didn’t handle it well with using buzzfeed as a shutdown for progressing to sex if she wasn’t feeling it. She should have just asked for a rain check. Which is my other point...

*both are using technology to ignore the other. Reddit, buzzfeed, gaming. Whether it’s intentionally intended or an unhealthy habit it’s blocking their ability to communicate. And I say this acknowledging that it’s one of the biggest roadblocks in my own relationship. We’ve had to agree to ban all forms of technology during any kind of ‘quality time’ whether that’s date night, just before going to bed (to sleep), Sunday morning sleep-ins (sex is imminent) and one of us wakes up first. Tech is an instant mood killer and does not facilitate communication. 

"
869,"\&gt; She's never asked how I'm doing or how I'm feeling. 

Please say this to your gf. "
870,"Short relationship and a significant age difference. 

Let it go. You need to focus on starting your career with a bang. Focus on that first. The rest of your life depends on it. "
871,Has she actually quit her job?  Or was she fired?  Might explain the behaviour?
872,but like ... a really good friend should be like 'so you had an abortion. are you ok? do you want to talk about it? I support your decision.' 
873,"&gt; I do not understand where his money goes and he never has an explanation as to why he is so broke...He has asked me for loans before.

This alone would be enough reason for me to say break up with the guy. Money management is a huge potential source of stress in any relationship/marriage. It's not your fault that he is being irresponsible. It doesn't matter what your friends think; staying with this guy would be crazy."
874,"Just want to note that her crying doesn’t mean you can’t continue a conversation. Let her know that you can take a break from the convo while she composes herself, then come back to it in 5 minutes. Repeat as necessary, or at a later time when she can be more calm. I’m a crier, but I don’t do it to shut down conversations - I can’t help it, it’s an emotional response. "
875,While I agree with all of this and also paused at him saying that I'd say OP really has a lot on his plate right now and him learning to accept his father should be placed really low on this list. I say this as someone who is normally super vocal about lgbtq rights.  His wife sounds extremely mentally ill so I'm hoping he can find help getting her stabilized soon.
876,"Yeah, it's like a child who cries because they don't want to take medicine, and the father says ""all right"" and takes them to eat ice cream instead. This parent isn't helping the child, on the contrary, they're putting them at serious risk. It's the same thing here.

OP is making everything worse when he folds."
877,The fact that you've set boundaries with him and he's continuously disrespected those boundaries is a huge red flag. Have you ever asked him why he feels a need to put you down and disrespect you all the time? Love is not all you need to make a relationship work. Good and healthy communication is just as important and you will end up resenting this guy if nothing changes IMO.
878,"If you can't just lock her out of that character, it's really going to say, ""I don't trust you"" if you have to put a PW on the entire account.  While it may be true, it's not going to bring you any closer together.  

Wait and see how she is tomorrow.  Sleep on it.  The game thing is just a game, but her dismissing you asking her not to do something is the bigger issue.  If it's a one time mistake, talk about it, but if it's something that's come up before, it really shows a lack of respect and boundaries.  "
879,"It's not shallow to break up with someone who doesn't stop when you say ""ow"" and are clearly in pain... he's prioritizing orgasms over you. "
880,"The misunderstanding was that you thought you could depend on your parents and they made it clear that you can't.   You are young enough that the relationship might be salvageable.  But only if they understand how damaged it is.  Suggest some family counseling.  If they won't go, start withdrawing.  

You don't have to announce that you are cutting them off, just be less and less available.  If they complain or try to guilt you, remind them of this incident and their betrayal.  When they say that you won't let it go, tell them that's what happens when people who say they love you don't accept their actions of betrayal."
881,"&gt; It's time that you start working as a team and figure out what your best options are.

I mean, if ""working as a team"" was the kind of attitude that OP's husband would have, she wouldn't be in this situation in the first place."
882,"Here’s the thing though, when you date as a single parent it is always possible that a person who was once viewed as a parent figure by your child will walk away. That’s the reality of it. This fantasy that op has created is only beneficial for her and what she wishes was the reality but not really anyone else. How can Tracy and others not see it as a family when that’s exactly how op is setting it up? ‘Dad James’ and ‘Uncle James’ both read ‘family’.

This isn’t a long term solution. James is going to want to settle down and have an actual family of his own someday and I can’t imagine every woman will be as nice about this little delusion as Tracy is being. Op needs to back off, give James and Tracy room to be an actual couple without she and her kid tagging along, and explain to her kid that James is simply a family friend. If James and Tracy decide to pack up and move next month, then what? I get she wants a stable figure in her child’s life but that’s for her to figure out and her actual family to help with, not for this guy to allow her to dictate his relationships and nag at his significant others when she’s the one determine to still third wheel with an ex. 

Reposting and edited  since it was deleted for ‘bad’ language. "
883,"For me personally, it was a wake up call. I didn't want my depression to affect the one I love most, because he deserves to be happy. I started getting better for him, and when I got my self confidence back, I started doing it for myself as well. I understand everyone is different and she might react differently than I did. You know her best, so go with your gut."
884,"&gt; That way she can get an inside look.

Good idea, tbh this will probably soon put her off. I got a data entry job at a law firm when I wanted to be a lawyer and soon realised it's not the industry for me!"
885,"I'm honestly confused. If your girlfriend wasn't in the mood to help you network, why did you insist she stay? 

I don't know how far you will make it as a photographer if you need your girlfriend to babysit your networking opportunities."
886,"Yes. Definitely report a confrontation that has a threatening tone. If there's a second one that gets the police involved, the first question will be ""Why didn't you report the first one?"" also it will be good for CPS to have a police record of how he reacted. "
887,She needs to speak to a therapist. The depression part needs to be addressed. Usually when someone is trans it is accompanied by sever depression. The divorce part is up to you and totally understandable. You married a woman because that's what you are attracted to. I would give it some time though if she's willing to see professional help.
888,"&gt; Not just that, but when she noticed that I had realized, she locked the door.

This is not OK. Why are you even considering staying with someone like this?"
889,"**Change your passwords!** Also get some legal representation, because you're facing more than one issue here. Harassment now and custody down the track. Involve the police. They can at least tell you what action can and can't be taken."
890,"""And you want to fuck Tyler now, so that's a new wrinkle."""
891,"Committing adultery in your heart is looking at another woman lustfully as well according to the Bible. If you guys are open and honest together, ask him about it. Does he have an accountability partner? In his mind even masturbating to porn could be adultery if he is religious. "
892,"If you're at school, take as many classes about minority groups in the US as you can! African American literature, Asian or South American history, etc. Lots of schools require these gen ed classes that you can use to your advantage! You got this!"
893,"Someone gave me this advice when I was going through a similar situation. If you forgive him and stay together, you’ll be shifting the burden of cheating from him (for actually doing it) to you (for needing to forgive &amp; forget). 

Be conscious of where the burden falls if you choose to stay together. It shouldn’t be on you. "
894,Well. That’s a sign of a serial abuser right there. 
895,"Yeah, for both men and women. Most people are not going to be happy in a completely sexless relationship unless they're asexual, incredibly low-libido, or allowed to sleep with other people. "
896,"Yep, I'm a TOTAL crier. I can be having a disagreement with my SO and not even be angry/upset/sad and I'll start to cry. It's just once my emotions get to a level my body is all ""heeeeyyyy, let's cryyyy"". I've had issues in the past with this with previous SO's (and even family members of mine). Basically what I do now is point out the fact I'm crying and say I can't help it. Explain I'm just trying to have this conversation or whatever and I'm not mad/angry/etc. It's not a perfect solution but I physically can't stop those tears from flowing. 

OP's SO isn't a crier. They are controlling and manipulating OP. It's people like that who made my SO initially think I was crying to ""get my way"". "
897,I like to donate to pp in shitty people's names. Makes me happy. 
898,"&gt;The last year or so has been really stressful, not only because of having a child and everything I've said about my wife. My mom died unexpectedly soon after the birth. My brother also got diagnosed with an aggressive cancer last week and has maybe 6 months. I haven't told my wife. One of my few friends is suffering in an abusive relationship (kids included) and there's nothing I can do to help. And to top it all off, my dad who's been my role model my whole life suddenly decided to start living as a female.  

Jesus man, what the hell is going on?  Your life is in shambles right now.  

First and foremost, make yourself an appointment for therapy RIGHT NOW.  The world is closing in on you.  Your infant needs you to get a handle on things for yourself, so you can take care of them.  

Second, your wife is a danger to your child as well as herself.  Demand she goes to see her OB/GYN or GP.  Go with her.  Explain everything.  If she refuses, call the police.  She is experiencing psychosis.  

There is a VERY REAL CHANCE that this story ends with your wife drowning your baby in a bathtub.  Or setting the house on fire when the baby is asleep in their crib.  I hate to be so graphic, but I simply cannot over emphasize how serious this is.  I really don't wanna see you guys on the evening news.  

I know money might be tight, but you need to take a leave of absence.  Look into paid FMLA.  Going into debt for a few months is much better than the alternate, which is losing your wife or child.  You need to get your house in order immediately...and by ""house"" I mean both your mental health, your wife's mental health, and the safety of your baby.  

Good luck, man."
899,"I would definitely suggest she work towards a paralegal certificate.  It's an achievable credential and will allow her to work in the field to see if its a good fit.  If she does well, many firms will help with night school if she still wants to go to law school.  If she can't get through a paralegal program or hates the work, maybe that will help her realize that the law isn't for her.  "
900,"Every 16 year old knows murder is wrong, but they don’t have life experience nor brain development to navigate a sexual relationship with an adult. Anyone older than them is in the position of power (whether that’s a hired position or not) simply due to the vast difference in experience. "
901,"Here’s one for you, then: my first session ever, in the classic ‘it had to get this bad before I’d finally make an appointment’ style.

Me: “...will this be hard?” 
Her: “Not as hard as what you’ve been doing!”

A flood of relief I can’t even describe. "
902,"Oh god, you've just described the beginning of the end of my relationship and marriage. I know exactly how you feel and where you're coming from. But you absolutely need to call off the engagement until she commits wholly to getting help with her depression and anxiety. As selfish as it sounds, you have to prioritize your own mental health first. Which is hard to do because you love her. You love her so much that you'll walk barefoot through hell and back to make her better, to make her happy.

Take it from me, a man who went through everything you just mentioned: it will *not* get better. You will *not* be able to shoulder it. It *will* break you. You will lose friends and work opportunities to take care of her. You'll let her walk all over you to keep her from crying. You'll go broke buying things for her because they ""help her anxiety/depression/etc"". You'll excuse yourself from public places because she breaks down and there'll be a sour cloud over whatever it is you were doing. You bending over backward will enable her (consciously or subconsciously, doesn't matter) to continue. She knows you'll always save the day and she gets codependent on you. You can't leave her side without her freaking out. You have to be there, with her, or nowhere at all. And, as I learned, everybody that cares about you worried sick about you because they can see everything that you lie about and mask to pretend everything is fine. 

You will resent her.

I did. I regularly thought that maybe if I died on my way home I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore. I would sit in my car out of sight of my apartment and stare vacantly into my steering wheel, feeling sick to my stomach knowing what awaited me inside. I used the reliability of bad Southern California traffic to excuse why I got home later than I should have. Just to give myself a few minutes of peace before being goddamn Superman and solving another stupid problem.

You will resent her at the same time that you love her, and it will make you sick. You'll have to sideline your own ever-worsening depression for her. And she won't be able to help you. You will be absolutely alone, shouldering the depression of two people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - if she can't commit to seeking help for the benefit of your relationship, you need to let her go. For you more than anybody.** "
903,"I have a very similar problem that I attribute to my ADD. A one on one conversation with my math prof can turn into absolute gibberish if someone is just talking a few feet away when my ADD is really bad. So you’re not alone and it is a totally understandable problem. Like trying to watch a movie while someone shines a flashlight in your eyes. 

Anyways, you’re saying that you bring it up with him and he just....doesn’t respond? Like eyes glazed over ignores you? That’s a big fat red flag right there. Maybe even two, one for immaturely ignoring you and another for it being about something that isn’t even serious. Imagine his reaction to a big problem that requires serious compromise on his end. Yikes. OP, give him a real serious kick in the butt about this, and if there’s no change, REALLY reconsider your opinion of a guy who can’t even put in headphones for you. "

905,"This 100%, dated a girl whose breath always smelled bad to me no matter what she did, its a genetic incompatibility that has to do with immune systems, essentially if your immune systems are too similar theres a chance that one party will perceive the other's breath as bad smelling just from that. Sorry OP not much you can do about it except explain this to him. "
906,"Except if SIL uses OP’s opinions as her basis for quitting law, they/she may unfairly place blame for any of her future decisions on OP (eg it’s Op’s Fault SIL gave up, if OP hadn’t discouraged SIL then maybe she would’ve been a lawyer, etc). This is of course stupid, but it’s one of those things that people who lack foresight to see their failings often use to excuse why they aren’t successful in life - by blaming someone/something other than themselves.

I agree with the top rated post that OP should just stick to facts instead of opinions. If SIL wants a life guidance counselor she should seek one. It sounds like everyone in the family already know why she’s being rejected, but SIL either just isn’t listening or she’s just that delusional about her abilities. In which case you dont want to get involved in that kind of mess."
907,"This is a problem that's perfect for taking to therapy (solo, not couples). It sounds like there's something else going on here. It's very normal to check out other people while you're in a committed relationship, but the anxiety, obsession, and nitpicking you're describing seem destructive. A therapist could help you work it out in a safe environment for a few sessions.

99 times out of 100, I'm all for radical honesty with a partner, but I would talk to a therapist before you talk to your fiancee about this. The things you describe feeling weird about (the fat on her arms, especially) are not really normal, healthy critiques of a loved one's appearance, and I think you risk hurting her badly if you try to address this without professional help. This sounds like a ""you"" problem, which doesn't make you a bad person by any means, but does mean you need to be extra sensitive to how this might come across to her.

If you're no longer attracted to her, definitely break up before the wedding. But I would try therapy first. You could be in a self-destructive mode right now and this is just one way it's manifesting. Good luck!"
908,What an absolutely horrifying thing to experience. I am so sorry. No one should have to go through feeling like that. I

This post made me so sad and angry."
910,"Thank you. I don’t know much about restraining orders in my country but it’s obvious I need to do some reading up. 

My ex went very quiet as soon as he realised I wasn’t taking him back. I think he assumed because we were so in love we would work through it. I haven’t a clue where he is or what he’s upto these days but I think that’s best because I’m still hurting massively from his actions. "
911,That’s not what gaslighting is....
912,It sounds like you're both reacting really strongly to this. What's up with that?
913,Tell your husband that you would prefer that she doesn't stay over unless she can clean up for herself. Then ask him to relay the message and actually stand by it. She won't change if there aren't consequences.
914,I’m rooting for your family. You’re doing great as a dad and husband.
915,This lady has a pattern. She cheats on her long term partners and then moves on to the next one. Do you want a relationship to crash and burn in 10 years? Because this is how you get a relationship that crashes and burns in 10 years.
916,"&gt; I do want another child, but I don’t want to lose my husband.

Then you're going to have to choose.

I'm sorry OP, but your husband has thought about this, and he's telling you soul truthfully how he feels. And honestly, I think he's correct in his assessment. 

&gt; I got angry and argued that I deserved to have another child and Ryan deserved a sibling

This is a horrible selfish argument. "
917,Sound like she thought you were gonna hold everything down and thought it would be ok to be a stay at home but from what you’re saying sounds like she don’t care as long as you’re paying everything

920,"This is a hot mess. So many problem behaviours.

For one, she goes through your phone. For another, she has turned her own poor coping strategies and need for control into such a huge deal that she's utterly trashed a nice thing people were doing for her and with zero remorse. The second you pushed back, she scapegoats you and when you pushed harder she ditched you entirely.

Don't wait around. Let her stay gone and move on from this, it's only going to get worse - she has a lot of growing up to do."
921,"OP tried to work as a team. OP has no control over whether her husband is willing to work as a team. ""Work as a team"" is therefore useless advice."

I don't. How does it even work? I mean it might be okay while you're DINK but unless you are 100% committed to being childfree, I don't get it.

What if the kid needs a new iPad for school and the mom can't afford it. Does the kid go without? Does mom have to get a loan?

925,"I just went thru the same thing. Feeling this odd sensation that I was grossed out by my dad for no reason. Feeling guilty for even having those feelings. Then come to find out (after being in therapy for 1.5 years) Ive repressed a lot of memories from my young self, 4 to 6. 

A lot of the time my sensations are more indicative of what happened, and I don't really have any clear memories but my body does. Which is why it's hard to figure out why I feel the way I do. 

My advice to you is to get some professional help. I hope to the goddesses that nothing happened to you and they are just feelings you have and nothing more. But it's worth looking into. Especially when you are younger and can get help early. DM me if you have any questions. I'd be happy to help.

Sorry you're going thru this. it does get easier! "
926,"Sounds like you should ""negotiate"" with the uncle by having a drink with him and explaining that you and any kids you might have don't share your wife's views."
927,"My reaction to this is that my ex had a FWB before we got together. I didn't like her spending time with him for the same reason, and in the end she started avoiding him just to appease me. I felt pretty shit after finding this out. They really are just friends, not even good friends, just friends that used to fuck and now only see each other once every 6 months. It was wrong of me to let my jealousy get in the way of that.

Honestly, the only person who will ever know what her intentions are is her, but the big problem here is that you don't trust her. If you don't trust her then you cannot build a solid relationship on that basis. Your options are either to learn to trust her; continue not trusting her and struggle with the relationship; or end the relationship. Only you can decide which of these you want."

He’s the one ruining his own night by rushing to her side and obsessing over her mood and trying to convince her to socialize. Why? She’s being a brat. Send her home and network. Or just ignore her and network.  You missed a networking opportunity catering to your girlfriend’s pouty behavior and ruined your own night. 
930,"Look up and read through the ""Little Albert"" studies. What has happened to you is not a dissimilar type of conditioning. The first thing to do is to not ""blame"" yourself or beat yourself up for your feelings. 

You also don't want to try to suppress the emotions when they come, but let them pass through you. Imagine them like a shower head over you that is turned on and passes over your body. They will eventually roll off and end. Get to know that feeling and that sense of fully inhabiting your feelings in those moments. This is the start of ending them, even though it sounds like embracing them.

As time goes by, try to imagine the shower of fear as something you can control rather than is above you and turns on by itself. Imagine that you can turn it off once it is on. The fear comes, it starts to wash over you, but you reach up and you turn it off. It isn't easy, but you will get faster at it as time goes by. Imagine that the fear you are washed over with is a smaller amount form the shower head, too. 

Use this imagery to control your fear through time. You eventually will find that the shower simply won't come on and the fear will not be something which seizes you so strongly. "
931,"Considering she was a single parent when you started dating, it seems like the conversation about birth control and what do to if it fails should of happened and been on the same page earlier on.

932,Sounds like your bf has absolutely no belief in what you say. Does he not trust you? Also is he 31 going on 13 as who leaves stuff on a porch for you to collect after a fight. He didn’t deserve the replacement.
933,"6 months. This isn’t something that deserves a conversation. He will deny it. You don’t have enough to convince *him* he has an issue but you have maintained perspective here, and you are noticing not only him checking out young girls but *not* checking out attractive women. Trust your gut. You have enough to go on here to end things and in my opinion, if you have a conversation with the possibility of staying together you’re in a way worse position. Because he can *say* he isn’t. He will say you’re crazy. You’ll feel ashamed and you’ll doubt yourself. And the behavior will continue, with you too afraid to call it out if it does escalate. 

6 months. End it. “It doesn’t feel right”. 

If he wants to make a scene about needing a better reason? “I have noticed you stare at other women and they tend to be significantly younger than me. I’m not accusing you, but I saw it enough times that I know this isn’t a relationship I can continue.” 

He won’t really learn to hide it better if you tell him why but I wouldn’t do so unless pressed. "
934,"Absolutely agree. 

I breastfed mine for two years, working full time and I can attest to how physically, mentally and emotionally draining breastfeeding can be. 

Don't get me wrong, I cherished those sweet moments but I never suffered from PPD. So I can only imagine what she's going through. 

Formula fed by a happy mama is better than breastfed by an unhappy mama. "
935,"Yes i totally agree with all this. OP James and Tracy are good influences in your duaghters life and i think you're lucky to have them both. 
Firstly James has stepped up as a father figure and then Tracy a 'mother' figure. I sense its grinding your gears that she wants to play happy families with her new boyfriend. If it hurts you to much then ask your daughter to refer to her as Aunty Tracy and then your daughter knows them as substitute uncle and aunties and not parents. 

I also think you're overreacting about the picture and Tracy explained herself. I think it was sweet that she wanted to pass on the photos to you. 

I'm thinking its possible that you've got issues with James moving on from you and you're projecting it onto Tracy? Maybe you need to deal with these feelings before you make a mistake that will affect your daughters and James lige. Cutting them out of your daughters life will hurt her and him and it might make you happy but thats selfish. Please seriously think about the effect it would have on your daughter and James it's not fair. "

Secondly, the *entire* vibe radiating off this post is “I don’t like my girlfriend very much.” She doesn’t like your dog. She doesn’t trust you. You don’t trust her to be a safe source of comfort for you when you’re hurting. And you’ve only been together for 9 months. 

For what it’s worth, I can see her not being delighted by you sharing a dog with your ex, but no - you’re not in the wrong here. Grieve your dog, and do some thinking about the future of this relationship. Because it really doesn’t sound like you’re all that into this woman. "
938,"I've considered that ... I might do so, not really sure. Just thought I'd post here to see if I'm being unreasonable or not."
939,"I agree. Nothing about your post suggests you're mentally ill. In contrast, I would say you're very self-aware.

Have you ever researched intuitions and ""gut feelings""? Ya know, the notion that your body is telling you something important but you have no idea where this knowledge is coming from. Intuition is real, and you should always *always* listen to it.

I agree that you may want to explore this with a professional. Although somewhat controversial, you could even try hypnosis to see if you can uncover repressed memories. Regardless, while you may never know exactly where these feelings are coming from, talking to a professional may help you find a way to work through them. I worry that, left unaddressed, these feelings may become stronger, debilitating, or may even lead to you getting triggered in unexpected situations. 

If speaking to a professional seems too intimidating at this point, an alternative is speaking to a family member whom you trust. They may be able to share aspects of your childhood you have forgotten. 

Good luck!"
940,"No foreplay, refusing to provide you with any kind of pleasure and continuing to have sex with you while you are clearly in pain makes him an asshole.

He does understand you’re in pain.  He just doesn’t care."
