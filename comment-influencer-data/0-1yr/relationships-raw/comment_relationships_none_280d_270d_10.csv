0,What he is doing is wrong on so many levels. 
1,"Hey, reading this after your second edit. I'm really proud of you for sticking up for yourself with this guy, and for finally getting away from your child's father. You're a great mom, and you deserve all good things. ❤"
2,"Minister here.

Judging a person's value, and your willingness to be a friend to that person, based on whether they believe the same as you, is absurd. Even people who follow the exact same *path* have different beliefs, because one's relationship to the Infinite Divine (or lack of one, as in your case) is one of the most personal things there is.

It's *important* to have people in our lives that we don't agree with, because if we do not, nothing we believe is ever challenged, so we never have to actually put any critical thought into it.

In my life, I have friends who are Protestant Christian of various flavors, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Pagan, Heathen, Atheist, Apatheist, and Agnostic.  We *don't* agree on everything.  Sometimes we strongly disagree on stuff.  That's *important*, because where we disagree with someone is where we have an opportunity to learn.

Tell your girlfriend that he's in your life to stay, and that if she cannot countenance that, the door is over there."
3,"I agree with both laughing it off like u/GeorgiaScarlett suggested or acting confused like you have no idea what she's on about, like, ""huh? that was a million years ago.""

I also agree with u/Doughchild that you should get some maaaajor distance from these people. 

But I'm REALLY concerned that you're still in close contact with your abusive racist mother. Has she changed? Is she kind and supportive now? Has she apologized for her atrocious actions and words? 

And I don't know if your best friend is a jerk, or if this is more of the voice in your head taunting you. You're not a freak or a creep. You got out of an awful upbringing somehow to make a life for yourself. You're obviously very strong. But I would dip WAY into this with your therapist. I'm concerned you're surrounded by people that are not good for you. 

You sound fricking awesome to me. And tell your sister ain't nobody cares about her damn BF. Yawn. "
4,"I was gonna say if this was genuinely out of character that it could be a sign of psychosis/a brain tumour or something else wrong like that. And then I read your comments and I deleted my comment because... no. He made you cut off all your male friends and apparently gaslit you into thinking it was your idea, out of jealousy. And he's refused to get any help.

I agree with the other commenters - lawyer up and start divorce proceedings, now."
5,"I'd be very hesitant to go.  Yeah it sucks, but the fact you are going to have to uproot, change schools, deal with expensive housing, FAFSA,  etc etc etc seems like a no-brainer for you to stay in Texas

Good luck "
6,"It’s okay to leave. It really is. It doesn’t make you homophobic or transphobic. Some people are only sexually/romantically attracted to a single gender, some people like both. If your partner now identifies as a man, it’s okay to not feel romantically or sexually attracted to them. "
7,"It's ridiculous that it wouldn't be discussed, especially when you have children.  Marriage involves communication and compromise."
8,"Beyond the sleep thing, he needs to understand what the hell no means.

“No” doesn’t mean “change my mind”. It doesn’t mean “try again but harder”. No means fucking no. So when you tell him no, and he says “please” or keeps trying and you feel like you should give in or just get it over with or whatever, he is disrespecting you. And if he gets passive aggressive, then he’s being a child.

YOU don’t owe him anything, and if you want him to respect you, you need to lay out that personal boundary that your words carry weight. Tell him that if he cares about you at all, he’ll respect your consent."
9,"It seems like now that she's sure you're committed, she isn't trying to behave herself anymore. People have bad days and make faux pas, but it sounds like this behavior is in line with stuff you're more used to. She's telling you who she is, and you aren't liking it. If you try to settle things you're ""ruining everything"". Trust your gut on this one."
10,"Honesly, this is Brie and her boyfriend's fault for completely ignoring your boundaries. You *said* you only date women, and they're trying to put you in this box of being their unicorn. It's fine that they want to fuck girls together, but the way they're treating you is completely disrespectful.

The way you responded re: the sex worker might have humiliated them, but they should not have given you a list of rules without even getting enthusiastic consent from you. You didn't say yes. You didn't consent to being subject to their 'rules.'

I think you should send one follow up text. ""Hey, Brie. In the moment when you propositioned me I felt very taken off-guard and I regret not saying no right there and then. I told you I only date women. I was very offended that you sent me that list of rules without me saying yes or telling you outright I was interested in having sex with you and your boyfriend. I felt like you completely disregarded my feelings. I am not trying to shame you, nor am I sex-negative, but you completely crossed a boundary and I am not comfortable with that."""
11,"I don't think you guys have much hope of working out. If you see him as a man, you won't be attracted to him anymore. If you don't see him as a man, that would probably make him feel really bad about his identity. There's no real way for both of you to be together and happy. You can imagine it as being like if one of you wanted kids and the other didn't: you love each other and there's no hard feelings, but your needs are fundamentally incompatible."

14,"I’m a nanny who has worked for many different families who all had very different ideas in regards to parenting. If she keeps on about it, I’d address it in a way that doesn’t not attack her parenting style.

For example; him cosleeping was a completely surprise to me and you never gave me a heads up about that arrangement. It caught me off guard and honestly I was put on the spot with something I was not personally comfortable with. If there are regular expected routines with nephew, please communicate those ahead of time. 

A lot of parents shut down their logic brain when they feel they’re being attacked for parenting choices (which often times they are, either for good justifications or bad) and her night being ruined is firmly on her. 

As for in the future, unless she brings up the cosleeping arrangement has changed, I wouldn’t bite for overnight stays with you. If she gets pushy you can say that while it’s a choice that works for her and her family, unfortunately it’s an arrangement that does not work for yours. 

Be more blunt or diplomatic depending on the relationship you have with sis "
15,"What's the school's social media and teacher/student contact policy? Maybe go into the conversation armed with that next time, because she's likely violating the whole lot of it just to seem accessible."
16,How does she expect you to lie about being a law student to actual lawyers?  After a 4 minute conversation they're all going to realize you're full of shit.
17,"Ugh, this is a tough one. Personally, I think the employee deserves to be fired and management should know that he's using information he has access to because of them to creep on women, but the problem with that is that he already (clearly) has boundary issues AND now he has access to her address. She probably doesn't want to push it because of the risk of escalation. I'd leave it alone unless he continues to call or shows up at her house."
18,"For god's sake, stop trying to sabotage yourself and take the good internship.

Welcome to being an adult. Everyone's faking it and nobody knows what they're doing. This is ten times as true in the tech sector. You'll be an intern; people expect to have to teach interns things. "
19,"&gt; I am high risk preg and am delivering next month. I'd prefer he either save his days to help me at the end 

Way to bury the point! I'd be...miffed... to put it lightly... to know that my husband is choosing to throw his PTO days away on nothing when there will be a baby coming home in the next month. That's just sad. "
20,Never put a man before your career at your age. ESPECIALLY if you want to go to law school. This is coming from a law grad. 
21,[deleted]
22,"&gt; I'm an apprentice chef. I'm currently studying under one of the most well known Japanese chefs in the country.

OP, I don't even know you and I'M proud of you!

Break up with your girlfriend. Trust me, you will meet other women. Don't stay with someone who doesn't think you're good enough to boast about."
23,"&gt; She usually gets it herself or her parents (who have spoiled her) give her money for it.

You do realize that once she gets married, she is likely to stop asking her parents &amp; start asking you, right? You were able to ignore these unflattering traits by telling yourself that they didn’t affect you, but once you’re married, I’m guessing Mom &amp; Dad aren’t going to feel the same financial responsibility for their daughter anymore, so it definitely will affect you. 

Also, can we stop on the bit about “women get wedding crazy”? Some women do. Some women don’t. It’s not because she’s a woman. It’s because she is entitled &amp; has been enabled by her parents all of her life. "
24,"Things that are good here:

1. You realized that you got scammed, so now you’re going to be more careful &amp; more knowledgeable when you consider buying things in the future. 

2. You appreciate &amp; value your parents’ money. You’re not sitting here going, “Oh well, it wasn’t my money... my parents have plenty.” 

3. You’re trying to right this with your parents.

You’re doing alright, kid. Everyone makes mistakes. The reason scams exist is because enough people fall for them that the scammers can be profitable. I’m sure the things your parents are noticing here are that you feel horrible for making this mistake &amp; want to fix it, &amp; they’re probably proud of you for those traits. Everyone will make mistakes, but not everyone will work as hard as you to make things right. "
25,I'm going to completely gloss over your butthead husband here and say WAY TO GO! 5 pounds in 2 months with a new baby is nothing to sniff at. You're doing great! 
26,"She's jealous. I would respond with ""I'm only in my 20's, I don't need Botox. Maybe I'll consider it when I'm your age."""
27,"You probably need to sell it. Suggest to your Dad that you get it (house, plot it's on etc) valued by an independent surveyor or real estate agent. It will be worth something if maybe not as much as your Dad imagines. He should at least get most of his money back.

Just don't get sucked into an unrealistic moneypit project. Renovations on the scale you're describing always go way over budget.  Get professionals involved before you commit to anything.
"
28,"&gt; I am freaked out by this situation and I think I want to break up. 

Good thinking!


&gt; What is confusing me is that he is usually a very kind and nice person. 

That describes virtually every abusive person. "
29,"I haven't gotten through all of the responses, but is it possible that he's being unfaithful to you and he's projecting his guilt? 

I am feeling stunned for you; I'm glad you're safe - that kind of explosive and irrational behavior is terrifying. "
30,"I'm so sorry about your mom's diagnosis and this potentially terrible diagnosis of your own.

If you *do* have this condition, does this man sound like he's going to be a supportive partner in the future? I don't think so. It seems more likely that you'll end up managing his emotions and destructive behavior in addition to your own health and emotional issues."
31,"""Hey, before we go to this work thing, you need to know something. I wear a wig to work, and just work. It is part of what I consider my professional uniform. Thought I should give you a heads up."""
32,Sounds like your brother loves attention.
33,"Yeah, the whole way-too-late-to-be-bed-sharing issue aside...where does she get the idea that you would just somehow KNOW this is how her second grader sleeps? And that Nephew having never spent the night anywhere without his mother wasn't crucial information?? People tell me when their DOGS have never spent the night without them. 

IDC if in *their* house, Nephew needs to do three cartwheels before getting a snack or always says his prayers in Pig Latin...maybe MENTION this beforehand?? 

And the fallout for not **asking** you if it was okay for Nephew to sleep in your bed with you is that she ruined her *own* anniversary. "
34,"I think this is a preview of what married life will be like. It might calm down a little once the wedding is over, but this is who she is. She's been high maintenance the whole time, and that's certainly never going to end...and now you know she's not satisfied with who you are and what you have and what you look like right now, which suggests to me that she doesn't love you for who you are as much as for who she thinks you could be or who she wants you to be."
35,"&gt;My father was invited and forgot to come even after being reminded multiple times. It really put where I stand with him into perspective.

He didn't forget. He's making a conscious choice to not be involved in your life. I'm so sorry OP. 

When this is all over, consider talking to a therapist. Being rejected by a parent is hard and requires a grieving process to get through.

Congrats on your wedding and I wish you all the happiness."
36,"Some men completely lose their desire for their partner after she gives birth. It has nothing to do with weight and everything to do with their own neurosis. He says it's the weight, but it may be that he can no longer see you in a sexual way. In that case, losing the weight won't change his lack of desire. 

Instead of letting his assessment of the reason for his loss of attraction destroy your self-esteem, go see a therapist together and try to get to the bottom of it. "
37,This is so much worse than you think it is. 
38,"&gt;When I just ignore him after I say no in the hopes that he’ll give up, he’ll get all hurt and passive agressive.

Let him be hurt and passive aggressive.   Stick with your no and ignore his immature response.  If this results in the two of you breaking up then so be it.   He is being incredibly disrespectful of you and this isn't the kind of person that you should build a long term relationship with."
39,What a lovely happy update - and I had to go back and check your ages because the maturity and self awareness you have both shown is pretty impressive. Big smile from this mom 🙂 Happy holidays!
40,So many levels. Screams of disrespect. 
41,"As a trans person myself: a million times yes to this comment. If you can be friends at some point, support him as a friend. 

Leaving him for being a man when you’re a straight man makes sense and doesn’t make you shitty or transphobic, it makes you a straight man who doesn’t want to date a man. That’s it."
42,"&gt;  I would never admit this to anyone in real life because it sound so dorky, but my sister is actually my best friend and biggest role model, she is awesome at so many things like playing chess and tree climbing which she taught me.

This isn't necessarily relevant to the actual situation, but you should definitely express this to your sister, even if it sounds dorky and awkward. It would mean a lot to her.
"
43,"This dude is not going to be supportive through your efforts to find out whether you have this condition, and if you do have it, expect him to leave you immediately.

The fact that he had a rage tantrum after you told him it was hurtful tips this over into ""get out immediately"" territory."
44,Tell him to stop spending money on parties and drugs because now he needs to pay for your new wardrobe. 
45,"Consider that this is not something that's about you, but about them. It might have nothing to do with how much of a freak you are. Some people are selfish and prefer to pigeon hole others, because it's just so much more convenient for them. It's been years, but you're still looking for their approval. They know, they don't care and they only give that in small amounts so you're left wanting. As long as you feel bad, they have power.

Also, it's not a surprise what your sister was planning, it's an ambush. Make this the last favor you're doing for her. You're busy otherwise. Find new friends. Maybe you should move to place where you're valued for you, not for what you can do for others."
46,"My husband once gifted me photo albums so I could print up the photos and organize them in the books. I’m still a little irritated by it because it wasn’t a gift, it was a huge project and I’ve still never had the time to finish them. 

This “gift” is a huge burden. Where are you supposed to get money for repairs?  Your dad is crazy to think saddling you with a remodel is a gift. That’s just nuts. Say no thank you and let him be mad if he wants. "
47,You wouldn't be ending it because of the choice of roommate. You would be ending it because of your boyfriend's disregard for your comfort and his inability to put his foot down regarding this guy's behavior.
48,[deleted]
49,"You could tell her that you didn’t want to come off as a fan and actually get to know her, because it would of been really awkward if you put her on a pedestal. Date 3 is probably the perfect time to tell her. "
50,Thank you so much. That is very sound advice. My parents wanted me to go to Pakistan with them in December to look into possible suitors for my brother's marriage but in the end I decided that it would be too risky and psychologically stressful to willingly follow them into a place where I just don't have the same rights and freedoms. They were really indignant when I refused to go but ultimately I think I made the right decision. I'm so sorry about what happened to your schoolmate. Did they ever get a divorce or come back to the UK?
51,I don't think his gf is very smart 
52,"I was on the side of ""harmless lie because he was embarrassed"" until this:

&gt; And then here's this gorgeous new coworker I've never heard of before

A goody two-shoes is playing hooky with an attractive female coworker he's never told you about and then lied to you about it? I don't know, man. I try not to jump to the suspicious conclusion but that sounds shady to me."
53,"Hey this is cool! A long term update. Congratulations, I hope yall have a long happy life together!"
54,"You should tell her. Be truthful and get it out of the way the next time you see her. ""I have something I wanted to tell you. I've listened to your podcast - before we had even met. I was surprised to see you on Tinder but thought your profile was so awesome I had to msg you and see what could happen. I want to be honest and upfront about that. I struggled to tell you initially because I wanted to have you open up to me naturally but I realised it wasn't fair that you were left in the dark. I really like you and have enjoyed our past dates - I'd like to see where this goes but I also understand if you feel weirded out right now. I just want us to be open with each other and apologize that I wasn't from the start."""
55,"Rather than bottling it all up until it explodes, try talking directly and calmly about it. 

Say, ""Dude, I need you to stop making jokes about my cleaning. If you need me to do something differently, approach it directly and with a plan. This is what I'm doing right now. It makes me upset when you pick at me, and I'm telling you so you'll stop, and I'm giving you an alternate way of doing things. If we need a different system for chores, let's figure that out. But seriously: no more jokes about my cleaning habits."""
56,"It's pretty weird that he is so worked up about your ""health"" but only asked about STI screening.  I don't see him demanding a pap smear or physical every 3 months.

Honestly, this is so strange that I think you need to have a sit down with him to get to the bottom of it.  There's no way this is just about your health, OP."
57,"Screams of abuse. Both things he is doing, the waking her up repeatedly and manipulating her into sex. It's all about control. "
58,"I went through something similar, my parents were together for 26 years and suddenly they announced that they were getting divorced. I was married for a little more than a year at the time. My wife actually commented on my trying a bit to hard at our relationship and I came to the conclusion that it was fear. If my parents relationship ended so could mine.
Think that your relationship is not as theirs were. Keep it as a reminder to treasure your wife :)
Hope it helps."
59,"That's seriously shitty of her, mate. Wow.  :(

**edit:** oh wait, you've only been dating four months? Dump her. "
60,"**He has chosen.**

He is married to _his wife_.

He lives at _his house_.

He spends most of the day with _his family_. 

"
61,He put his job at risk so he could go on a date without you knowing. 
62,"Honestly, it's less about your opinion and more about your phrasing.  It comes across a little like your opinion is right and theirs is wrong.  When you phrase something like ""can't you just do ___"" then it's going to come across a little condescending, no matter what you're talking about.  Honestly, I suggest you try to just not state your opinion as much.  If someone says they can't go out because they have to do something for their kids, then just say ""okay, when would you like to meet up instead?"""
63,[removed]
64,"Sooo I was married several years ago and my husband started becoming abusive and always accusing me of cheating. He was incredibly possessive and expected me to come home straight after work. If I came home a few minutes late he would ask who I had been fucking. One such time he actually grabbed me and shoved his hands down my pants and said that I wasn't 'dry' so I must have been fucking someone, and then he physically/sexually assaulted me. (Cuz apparently he forgot how vaginas work?? They're often moist ya know...they are self cleaning.) Soon after that I came home one night and declined sex because I had bronchitis, and he said I was fucking someone else, then he took my debit card and checkbook and threw me out on the street with literally nothing and nowhere to go.

&amp;#x200B;

You know what was actually happening? He was having an affair. "
65,"See here is a thing that my grandparents did to me and their children for years.... They invested in tons of properties and when a property became burdensome, they 'gifted' it to one of us. They had what is basically a piece of swamp land next to a property which was occupied by about 8 rednecks. They could not sell the land because of the neighbors and because the land needed a lot of improvements to be able to put a house on it. They got tired of paying taxes and mowing the yard, so they 'gifted' it to me. Now I live next to an abandoned house that is full of mold because the rednecks never fixed the roof after a hurricane, then were surprised when their house started falling apart a few years later. They also left all their pets and so I had to deal with that. AND it's completely overgrown with weeds that trickle into my yard, and bring tons of bugs with them. The back 1/3 of my yard is full of invasive bamboo that makes the land useless, and keeps it damp and dark and breeds mosquitoes. 

A few years ago they 'gifted' my mother a piece of land in the middle of nowhere with zero public access. Literally no roads that went to the property. Unsaleable piece of land. My mother sold it dirt cheap to someone who owned the land near it which actually had access to the roads, just to not be burdened with the taxes and liability. Grandparents were pissed. So then they 'gifted' her a house with fucking aluminum wiring that cost $12,000 just to repair enough to be able to sell. Around the same time they 'gifted' my uncle one of their mortgage-by-owner properties, which is cool right? Monthly income? NOPE. The person living there was four months behind on their mortgage payment and my uncle had to evict him and then renovate the house, which was about 2 hours from his home. 

In a similar vein, they insisted I take a riding lawn mower from them and that it was so nice of them to do this for me. I lived over 2 hours away and had no truck, so I had to borrow their truck and create like ramps for the mower, get it home, drive their truck back, and GO FUCKING FIGURE the lawn mower had MULTIPLE issues like it needed new tires, had an oil leak, needed new blades, needed new belts... More money than just buying a used mower from someone local. Etc.

MY GRANDPARENTS WOULD RATHER GIVE THESE THINGS AWAY THAN ADMIT THEY ARE TAKING A LOSS ON THE SALE. Then they get the added benefit of holding their generosity over your head for years, and calling you an ungrateful spoiled brat should you ever not do something they ask of you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying your dad is as big of an asshole as my grandparents, but seems like maybe he wanted to push the burden of responsibility onto you. You are in no position to take this responsibility and it's unfair of him to expect this of you. He gifted you a piece of trash and that's really shitty of him. He needs to just admit that the property is a loss."
66,"I've been in your shoes, including a partner expressing nerves after I shit-talked an abusive ex. It sounds more to me like your bf is insecure and expressed it in an inappropriate way. If you trust him enough to talk to him about how your relationship is different and why what he said is hurtful, do that. If you don't trust him that much, listen to your instincts and leave him so you can find someone you can trust that way.

EDIT: YEP, that phone call sounds like a nightmare and thank God you trusted your instincts. Hope you and your child find some measure of peace and safety in your future. 

Edit 2: this advice was written before the edits were available and is obviously no longer applicable! No need to point that out.

Also, stop interpreting ""maybe bring up how this thing sucks and ignored your experiences if you feel like it"" as ""disclose all your trauma completely."" Thx. "
67,"Girl, reading this breaks my heart. 

He raped you.

He's misogynistic.

He's emotionally abusive.  

He intentionally isolates you.

He constantly checks up on you. 

He *doesn't* care about you. He is *not* the great love of your life.  

Please remove yourself from this situation and live your own life.  You're *twenty*, you're so young.  You have a whole life ahead of you, and if you leave him, you have the opportunity to make it a beautiful one.  Please don't let this abusive man and unhealthy relationship take any more of your time and heart. 
"
68,"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

Take the offer, and don't look back. If at a later date, he starts to ask for favors that you don't agree with, just say, ""no.""

He is giving you a gift. You don't owe someone anything for a gift (unless you decided you want to be indebted to them. There is just no reason for that.) 

---

Edit: If you still feel indebted, pay it forward. In the future, when you are well off. Find a deserving young relative and cover his/her education."
69,This is utterly vile behaviour from him and I agree with the above poster that you need a good lawyer.
70,"&gt;Also, can we stop on the bit about “women get wedding crazy”? Some women do. Some women don’t. It’s not because she’s a woman. It’s because she is entitled &amp; has been enabled by her parents all of her life. 

Thank you!! That needs to be said more."
71,"One of the best quotes I ever heard is, '""No' is not the beginning of a negotiation."""
72,"&gt;We have frequently had fights over him taking vacation time without passing it by me (a week here or there) and then later telling me he can't take more time off with us as a family. 

A WEEK??!?  He thinks it's okay to take a week off and not coordinate with his wife?  I was expecting a day off for a long weekend or something, not an entire week.  No, you're not being unreasonable at all.  The petty part of me would just take a week off and not tell him and see what he does, but don't do that lol.  I would stop trying to get him to agree with you and focus on enforcing boundaries, and if he can't follow your boundaries then you should consider marriage counseling.  "
73,"Imma be blunt:

Your girlfriend's parents don't like you, have probably never liked you, and have been waiting for something like this to demand that your girlfriend break up with you. 

Just reading between the lines: you're 9 years older than your girlfriend and come from a different socio-economic class than her, and you're not making big bucks. You are not the dude that wealthy parents want to see their little girl dating. 

I'm sorry. Tell your girlfriend that it's up to her to stand up to her parents, or choose to buckle to their demands because there is nothing you can do on your end to make her parents okay with you as her partner."
74,"&gt; I don't know what will happen from here, but unless he reaches out to me in attempt to make this right, I don't have anything else to say to him.  

Op you don't have anything else to say to him **period.** He showed you his priorities, if he comes back to you it's because she turned him down. You deserve to be more than someone's plan b."
75,"This response makes me sad. This isn't a unicorn. This is a decent human being. Your bf is borderline rapey and when he doesn't get his way, incredible selfish, immature, and mean. You can do better. You should want to do better."
76,"&gt;If the City Code Enforcement sees this house, they will for sure condemn this house for demolition.

I mean, it seems like there's an easy fix here... 

&amp;#x200B;"
77,"After reading your edits, it's clear you knew him really well. You gut instinct was very sharp -- you knew it was more than a joke. Good on you for being this discerning. You dug deeper and found out his true feelings. I'm sorry his true feelings sucked. Just. Thank you for trusting yourself and not sweeping it under the rug. You did fantastic."
78,"&gt;EDIT: Some people wrote me personal messages to send pictures of her so that they can weigh in on how attractive she really is and give tips for her on how to improve her looks. I'm sorry I don't really feel comfortable doing that :( I'd say she has a very normal looking face, maybe a bit guy like looking (many people say we look alot alike :P ) and she doesn't use makeup or stuff like most girls. Also she doesn't really have boobs and stuff, but I never imagined someone would find her ugly

People have already given you good advice, but OP, send screenshots of the people PMing you to the mods. Those people are being predatory assholes and they will be banned from this sub, as they damn well should be. Is it that hard not to be fucking terrible, people?"
79,If he's a close friend then he won't give a shit and will support you even if you wore a cat on your head. 
80,"&gt; I’m a tech in an operating room, and currently enrolled in paramedic school. 

Lol. That is absolutely not a ""blue collar"" career. Your current job and career path are both interesting and intriguing. Stop overthinking and just see if you mesh well with her. "
81,He better fucking pay you back for all that goddamn
82,"So is your husband willing to cook healthy meals, pick up more household duties, and take care of the baby more so you can get the free time needed to sleep properly and exercise?

85,"No, you shouldn't go. Your BF should trust you and you should not entertain his insecurities.

Tell him, that

* you are not planning on going
* because you hate your co-workers
* and you are looking for a new job.

If he continues to push the issue, be very blunt with him that he is valuing his own issues over your well-being and that is a problem for you.

Do not enable his insecurities/jealousy. There is no reason to meet co-workers you despise and are planning on leaving."
86,"Honey, you just made excuse after excuse for this man. I count at least four. Do you know how many times my husband has hurt my feelings over things MUCH less awful, and I've made excuses for him? None. In 28 years of marriage. Do you know how many times he's ever been violent? None. How many times he's told me my fears over my family's health or my own weren't valid or important? None.

My husband isn't exceptional in these things. Those are behaviors that are the bare minimum standard of decency for a human being.  Your BF isn't meeting them. I'm sorry, I know it's hard to hear and accept when you are under so much stress and fear. He's a bad person. You need all the support and good people you can find. "

It’s firm. It’s professional. It’s not that you suddenly aren’t available. You never were. 

I’m angry for you and I’m sorry this happened. If he escalates be ready. “I must be misunderstanding the situation. It sounds like this could create a toxic work environment and that can’t be something you’d allow. Going forward let’s ensure things are professional.”

89,"&gt;He wants to stay together but only if I change (not to be a dude!!) but he doesn’t see me as happy within myself and says we won’t work if I don’t fix myself, he wants more friends, he wants me to be independent, he doesn’t want to do things just us anymore (all the things I love like our walks, picnics, bike rides, camping, Flix n chill) he said our marriage made him fat and depressed (he’s now lost so much weight and is grooming more etc)

Get out, OP.  He might be promising you faithfulness, but what he isn't promising you, or even showing you, is love.  You deserve better.  You didn't make him fat and depressed, that's very shaming of him to claim and it shows a distinct lack of self-awareness and willingness to take responsibility for his actions.

There was a post some time ago, from a woman who had stayed with and supported her husband after he came out, for years, until he felt ready to leave her and go date men.  She took care of him, but nobody took care of her.  I still feel her heartache.

You can still love him and be his friend, but you are selling your life out if you remain his wife.

IMO of course.  And I'm sorry you're going through this."

How much active quality time does she spend with him per week? How much active quality time with you? Brushing your teeth together is not necessarily quality time- but it can be.

She should be spending much more quality time with you than with him. Period. I’m making up a number here but I’d personally feel uncomfortable if it was anything less than a 3/2 ratio, favoring you. Maybe even 2:1.

If she’s not willing to change her priorities and make Your Marriage her priority, then she has made her choice.  

As of now, your marriage is Not her priority. Her words in this: meaningless. All that matters are her actions. Her voices to be defensive, not hear you, make it about feminism, go To His house after a fight about him, be out of contact for 6 hours, and leave a fight about this to go His spin class- her relationship with Him has come first. Period. Again, her words here are meaningless and don’t matter. She has shown with her actions that he is the priority.

101,"&gt;He thinks because of freedom of speech, people can say whatever they want **without repercussion**, and that people should just ""get over it"".

Yeah NO. If he has the ""freedom"" to be a complete piece of shit, then everyone else has the ""freedom"" to take offense at that and avoid him, because who wants to be around a complete piece of shit? Do you not see how utterly hypocritical he is? What he actually wants is to do whatever he wants *without consequences*. Which is how toddlers think, not adults. Adults recognize that their actions have consequences. 

I bet he also ""tells it like it is"", right? He's ""blunt""? ah yes, the clarion call of the total asshole in his natural habitat. Honestly dudes like this are a type, I wonder if they'll find the gene that codes for ""telling it like it is"" in future genetic population studies.

&gt;I guess I am taking this personally because he has said ""jokes"" to me before that I have not been okay with (calling me a stupid and or silly b, saying things like ""why would you even go"" when I had a wake for a friend's dad, or things like ""I hope you fall"" when I'm out doing something...

OP, I don't know if you grew up in an abusive family or what, but I wouldn't speak like this to my worst enemy. Why the fuck would you accept this kind of treatment from your significant other?

&gt;I guess I am wondering whether this is a red flag, a major personality incompatibility between us, or if I'm just taking things way too seriously because I'm starting to second guess myself...

Yeah, he *wants* you to second guess yourself because then he can keep treating you like crap. FYI, name calling is abuse.

102,"&gt; on top of that they have gone on several overnight trips (sharing a hotel room) for swimming competitions

This would make me very uncomfortable. 

&gt; He often invites her over for drinks (his wife is home) when I'm going for a session at the pool, and they have also recently started recording music together

I find it odd that they wouldn’t try to do this when you’re available. Are you *sure* the coach’s wife is there too? 

&gt; my wife makes a joke that she and Gabe's wife might go make out a bit on the dance floor. 

Are they swingers, perchance? I might retract my earlier comment implying the wife wasn’t there...Maybe they all, well...

&gt; my drunk wife whispered somethings in Gabe's ear (very loud music) and they had a laugh. 

Eek. 

&gt; we had a blowout fight about it

&gt; Shortly thereafter, she ended up leaving to go to his house to play music with him 

So you have a huge fight about how your feelings are hurt by her relationship with Gabe. And her response is....to go hang out with Gabe. Yeah, seems to be a lot of respect for you here. /s

&gt; We talked things over more, and despite the fact that we were both still upset and things were rocky, she left to go to the spin class with Gabe because ""they had plans and it was too late to cancel"".

Seriously???

&gt; Any insight would be appreciated.

Trust your instincts. Even if she’s not f*cking Gabe (and, honestly, she might be), she has no regard for your feelings as evidenced by her behavior. Don’t allow her to turn this on you. This doesn’t have a damn thing to do with feminism or whatever else she’s preaching. That’s pure deflection from her inappropriate behavior. 

This might be my hill to die on.

103,"Honesty is great but this is a little dramatic sounding in my opinion. She's only going to think it's as big of a deal as you make it.

104,"&gt; Is there something for me to reflect on that can help me get over this?

""Holy fuck, am I a lucky guy or what? I've got this amazing person in my life and we're here together. Bring it on, world.""

The only thing that has changed is your legal status, that's all. She's still the same person, she's still the woman you chose to walk down life's path with you. This isn't about her at all, methinks.

105,"Come on, **you know** your Girlfriend is being unreasonable here, you just love her so you are letting her bad behavior slide.

Do you really want to be with someone that is intolerant of people that do not have the same views as her? Because that's basically the kind of person she is. She thinks everyone who does not share her views is wrong. She dislikes him for having faith and a religion he follows. How sick is that? Do you really agree with judging people based on their religion? Your friend sounds like a stand up guy, even though he had a bad feeling about her, he tried to give her a chance anyways. He took a step out of his comfort zone and invited her into his life, cooked, bought presents, tried to get to know her. And your GF has turned him down, over and over again, and has tried to stop your friendship.

You KNOW she is in the wrong. I know you love her, but do you really think a woman like this is the best fit for you as a life partner? Does your friend deserve to be treated like this? You know the answer, you just don't like it."

109,"Your brother has issues. Why the hell would he think your parents would want to know or be interested in his sex life? 

I am pretty sure the majority of people do not talk to their parents about their sex life. It's a private topic. He will burn lots of bridges, beyond just his family, if he thinks it is acceptable to talk about his sex life with people who clearly would have no interest in knowing of it. 

I don't think there is much you can do aside from let him burn bridges and face consequences of his odd choices (not kinky sex, but disclosing it to people who do not need to know). Is he going to tell his barber next? Maybe his boss? Yeesh. Hopefully he will realize he is being a fool before he gets himself into trouble."

Girl, who is asking you these questions? How are you? How are you feeling? Are you okay? That was some heavy duty stuff you went through alone, and now you're the one expected to tidy up the mess that you didn't make? He was the one in the wrong and now he is punishing you, whether he is doing it consciously or not. You feel bad for asking him to stop having an affair? That's grossly unfair.

I'd highly suggest you get into personal counselling before any marriage counselling as it looks a bit like the power dynamic and self worth levels are quite off here. Well done for finding your voice and saying that it wasn't good enough for you. That took balls and you should recognise that within yourself. Worry about yourself and how you are going to heal and grow from this. It is entirely your husband's duty to fix the situation that he made and he should come to you to do so. "

How to get rid of bamboo:

Cut it all down. Let it grow back a couple inches, basically, just long enough to cut it all down again. Repeat some number of times. Eventually, the roots will be worn out from all the new growth and won't be able to sustain more new growth. You will be able to dig them up at that point.

I am a lesbian though, so having a threesome with a man isn’t something I would want to do. You sent me a list of really specific requests after all I said was “I’ll think about it”, which honestly left me feeling objectified as it’s clear you and Brad have been talking about sleeping with me. Moving forward, please don’t talk to me about this sort of thing again because I’m definitely not interested and I should have made that clear from the beginning.” "

134,"&gt; My wife sees it differently: that the idea of having three kids and three pets allows for each kid to have a ""buddy"". 

That...isn't how cats work. My partner and I finally relented after my 20-year-old cat passed away (we were both devastated) and got another cat. I was looking to fill that cat-shaped hole in my heart, and wanted another affectionate friend to cuddle with. This cat was great for a week, then showed her true colors as an aggressive asshole, lol. Nevertheless, as cats do, she chose her ""person"" - and it wasn't me. She'll jump into my partner's lap and cuddle him for hours, and wants nothing to do with me, the sexist jerk. So I brought home a second cat, ""Because *I* still need a cat!""

Second cat is much nicer, and will hang out with me...but still greatly prefers my boyfriend. C'est la vie.

Cats gonna cat. If you get a third, everything isn't going to neatly line up where each kid gets paired with their own cat. This isn't Harry Potter, these cats aren't going to take assignments. Three cats was stressful for you, and will be stressful again, and your wife needs to understand that."

Don't accept and internalize this gross characterization they've put on you for you to subconsciously agree that you've done anything wrong to them.

Don't let them make you feel ashamed of your blackness, especially since of the three of you you are the least Asian-looking. You're both, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Own who you are and own your heritage. Screw the haters and their weird, gross beauty standards.

I would say, dump them. Or severely limit your interactions. Life is too short to waste it on these kinds of people. Don't do them favors. Spend time with friends, there are so many people out there who will actually appreciate you back.

He chose the person who does scummy shit like cheat on his fiance, who blames you for his affair falling apart because it was with your friend, and who has repeatedly made you uncomfortable with his overly-sexualized conversations and comments.

This should have been a no-brainer for your BF. It says a lot that he not only chose his shitty friend, but he shut you down and didn't even care about why you are not comfortable.

Beyond that, it's been 3 years. It's equally telling that he doesn't want you to move in with him...."
164,"This is your baby.  You are it’s mother

They have no role in this decision

Also your boyfriend has parental rights that can’t be ignored

Straight up say no way. 

Stay away. Don’t contact them. Tell your bf "
165,"Oh my god, your poor sister. I think at this point you've got to tell your parents, because this is bullying.

You're a good brother, but fixing this is a higher-level thing than you're going to be capable of solving. You need to loop your parents in."
166,"So he either owns or leases the place you are currently living in, he is capable of extreme lies, he does not want his wife to know, he thinks he owns you, and he came over and let himself in after you made it clear you didn't want to talk to him?

You need to document all of this now, talk to a lawyer now, figure out your options to move to a place he doesn't have access to, get a custody plan and child support in place and ABOVE ALL ELSE safety plan.  When he gets desperate and realizes he is likely going to lose both you and your three children as well as his wife and his other four children who knows what he will be capable of doing.  You're really unsafe right now. "
167,"Hey OP. You can break up with her, and it will not destroy her. How do I know? I was that girl. Massively clingy, was suicidal after I got dumped. Made a lot of mistakes following the breakup. But I got through it. And she will too. Once you decide to break up with her, she is no longer your responsibility. Let her know that. Make it clear that she is on her own and she needs to handle that herself. Go completely no-contact, block on everything. Do not let her think there is any option of getting back together. If she thinks there’s hope, she’ll cling to that and you won’t be able to get rid of her. Let her know face to face that there is no chance of any reconciliation. This will be hard since she likely will think it’s not over permanently since you got back together once before. Tell your friends you’re not together and that they are no longer obligated to be friends with her if they don’t want to. Tell them they should not be updating her on how you are should they choose to stay in contact with her. Give her back her stuff as soon as possible so you can stay out of contact and to let her know it’s permanent. I promise you’ll be okay, and she will likely be okay too. On the off chance she isn’t, call her family or the local police and let them know she’s a danger to herself. Other than that, you’re off the hook. Congrats, you’re single and young and you have a brighter future ahead of you without her. But she is no longer your responsibility, just remember that and good luck :)"
168,Why did he date you for four years if he had such a big problem with your height? Rude.
169,"I didnt have a serious relationships until I was 25 and done w college. No shame in not getting serious with anyone until you want to. I always used to say ""I'm dating but haven't met anyone I want to bring around the family yet.""

170,"&gt; I am wondering if this is a deal breaker.

If he keeps bringing it up after you've made it clear that you're not going to do it, then yes, it's a dealbreaker."
171,Thank you very much for this. 
172,"&gt; What is confusing me is that he is usually a very kind and nice person

No he isn't. That side of him is a lie. Run... immediately. "

174,"That's great news. I remember your original post so it is good to get an update. 

And thank you for calling out the idiots who thought they would send gross messages to a woman. You didn't have to mention that in your update, but it is cool that you did."
175,The dude is using you. You know this. He isn’t really your friend if he stops hanging out with you if you don’t foot the bill. So stop footing the bill and if he decides that’s all your friendship is worth let him go and get a better friend.
176,"Nope, you are totally ok to keep that private. 

Also, 1 year is NOTHING. Diaries are meant to be kept private. She shouldn’t feel entitled to read it after 20 years. 

I would advise you to hide it better. Sounds like she may read it anyway :/ "
177,"So you text him back and go, ""Thanks for replacing the pot that you burned. So, when do I get to open my anniversary gift?"""
178,"This isn’t social ineptitude. It’s brazen rudeness, and highly manipulative to boot. Call them out and cut them out. "
179,"Tell him flat out that this lifestyle is unsustainable for you, and you don't see your marriage succeeding unless he pulls his head out of his ass and figures out how to be a dad to his child and a partner to his wife."

182,Good job.  Hold your ground.  Your feelings are valid.
183,"Dude... you're 18 years old and you were in a house that belongs to your girlfriend's parents. I'm unsure what your girlfriend expected you to do? If you 'defended her' by arguing back at her dad then you'd just create more issues. He has/had every right to tell you to get out. Acting respectful and following through with his wishes is probably the best you could do in that situation.


This isn't a case of you being attacked in the street and running off whilst leaving your girlfriend to deal with it."
184,"Hmm... I think it is a red flag. An apprentice chef sounds like a good job, there are many amazing and respectable, masculine and skilled male chefs that make good money. Good on you for pursuing what you are passionate about. I think it is a good point to evaluate your relationship; if she is bringing up concerns about career now, I wonder how it will be in the future; after all, finances are the #1 thing couples fight about."
185,"You didn't lie. You're going in as an intern. Trust me, you're not expected to know much at all. 

Look, I'm a software engineer. Even 15 years into my career there are a lot of things that are asked of me that I don't know how to do. But guess what? I work hard and I figure it out as I go. I ask questions. I learn on the job.

You can do the same thing. This is a good opportunity. Try to look past your insecurities and get in there, work your ass off, and figure it out as you go."
186,"Even taking weekends off by himself on a regular basis wouldn't be acceptable when they have two young kids and she's pregnant. Expecting her to be the sole caretaker during his little jaunts when she also works full time is so staggeringly selfish.

Edit: just read the edit that says it's a high-risk pregnancy and she's delivering next month, and he's STILL using his vacation days on a trip for himself...it honestly doesn't sound like this guy cares about his wife or children at all."
187,"This is something every young woman needs to learn - YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S FUCKED UP ACTIONS. TELL PEOPLE WHEN SOMEONE IS A FUCKING CREEP.

Your silence allows creeps to continue being creeps and rapists. Don't be ashamed to LOUDLY talk about the fucked up, creepy shit someone has done. "

189,"Tell him.  Using words.

You have the right to live your life as you see fit.  

You are not his child.  You are not his maid.  You are an adult with equal say in your relationship.

Playing games is no more or less legitimate than watching other people play a game on television.  His preferences are not objective facts.

Stand up for yourself.  You’re going to have to have a confrontation about it."
190,"Cats are not accessories to be buddied with children. And it’s clear that the children aren’t expected to take responsibility for these buddies. You are. You’re still in charge of the litter (why?). 

At the end of the day you have already compromised. You have cats. More than 1. She doesn’t need the 3rd cat. And sorry but the comment abojt the kids is just irresponsible. They’re individual animals with different tolerances and personalities. But you know this is just her manipulation tactic; to suggest you’re being unfair to the kids. You’re not. 

“It doesnt feel good to know that despite knowing I do the litter and have been talked into every other cat we have, you still think it’s okay to treat me this way, and try to guilt me into this. Ultimately I have compromised. I compromise every time, usually simply agreeing to what you want. But I can’t do that now. We have already compromised. We have more than 1 cat. I don’t want another.”

If she needs “new life” in the house to the point of guilting and manipulating her partner she needs a damn hobby. "
191,Yep. Just wanted to reinforce the don’t go to Pakistan or ‘home country’ thing.  Also had this happen to a friend and it ended badly for her.  
192,Right? Secret boyfriends at 27? Good god this woman is pushing 30 and acting like a teenager.
193,Thank you. That seems like it would be a good way to go about it. My main worry with selling would be just heavily undercutting what my dad paid for which still makes it seem like I wasted his money (he really wasted it but it’s not a blame game right now) 
194,"Even if it is a front, after 4 years the best he can do is essentially “I don’t want short kids, goodbye”? 

What a waste of legroom and time that guy turned out to be. "
195,"Girl, out of state tuition in Hawaii ain’t no joke, either....."
196,"Ask your father now if you can pick up sentimentals. Make a list, that way everyone knows what you're looking for. Family photos of a phase without stepmom are part of it. It should've been done ages ago actually. 

For the will and whatever your country has, that's a fight for later and it's more about money then. But see if you can get what's reasonable and sentimental now. Everything can be put in a box and outside for you to pick up. Make arrangements for a bigger car, so you can put everything in in 1 haul."
197,I think we found his real kink. 
198,"I’m glad you dumped him.

Pneumonia can kill healthy adults, so he was gambling with your life. Not to mention your children’s welfare. You absolutely shouldn’t have been driving.

He was probably a huge baby about the mildest splinter, too."
199,"Honey please please please don't be so hard on yourself. These things happen. People much older and more experienced than you get scammed out of way more money daily. You wanted to use all the help and resources you could get, which is normal and understandable. I understand and I'm certain your parents do as well. You need to forgive yourself. What you did wasn't that horrible or inexcusable. You can use it as a lesson to be more guarded and less trusting of strangers next time. But I promise you, it's OK. As for that chick, life is certainly not fair but you don't have to lay down and take it. You can complain and ask her for a refund, and if she brushes you off, which I'm afraid she probably will, write a scathing review/comment on facebook, to help others avoid getting scammed if anything. "
200,"&gt;We were married young and I had said that she “never needs to work again”.

This jumped out at me.

I have a friend who talks about people approaching marriage as ""the deal.""  So, say an older man marries a trophy wife purely as a trophy wife, and she marries him as a sugar daddy.  ""The deal"" is that she is his hot arm candy, so she should keep herself in shape and well-groomed if she wants to remain married - in turn, he needs to keep the money tap flowing.  We had a couple of our mutual acquaintance - both were low-level con-artists, and both had married each other thinking each one had more money than was actually there.  For them, ""the deal"" was trying to use each other for their money.  Or, you can be a couple that married to build a life through a partnership with mutual respect - ""the deal"" is pretty much that statement.

So...what was your ""deal""?  Has she been the homemaker?  How young did you marry - did she ever get an opportunity to start any sort of career?  Did she ever have an interest in a career?  Or was she happy being a wife and mother?

Now, do I think that she should have gotten a part-time job so you didn't have to move?  Yeah, I do.  I can understand why you're upset about that.  But by the same token...does your wife think you are violating your ""deal""?  Maybe it's not that she sees you as a piggy bank - she just sees her part of your partnership is running the domestic part of your marriage.

I don't know if this is a right-or-wrong situation, though I do think you guys need to work on your communication.  I think she may be defensive - and even guilty - about not having a job before, and you ""rudely"" asking/telling her to get a job may be triggering this reaction.

You may need to get a divorce here, but you may want to figure out the heart of this problem first.  If nothing else, a little bit of marriage counseling is cheaper than a divorce if it helps you suss out the problem.  But if one or both of you are already checked out of the marriage, then it might be over.

Sorry you're going through this, but I think this might be more complex than your wife just being a lazy gold-digger.  It may be that she has some fears of her own she's not expressing.

Good luck with whatever happens."
201,"Wooooow, the sheer fucking *disrespect* of e-mailing you instead of confronting you like a man, or even just a person with some honor and integrity.

You're engaged to a coward, but like all cowards, they show who they are when the heat is turned up. He's dead scared to actually face you, and when you drop his ass (or even threaten to), I bet he grovels and says he ""chose you"". You won! Congratulations!...until the next crush comes along, then you're on the chopping board again. You should be *mad*, you should be storming up to his little hidey hole and have him btfo.

Let's tally this up, eh?  
1. He went on a date with another woman.  
2. He's been developing feelings for this woman for a looong time and has done *nothing* to nip the crush in the bud.  
3. He lied when confronted.  
4. He has the *audacity* to think this is about him, that this is really hard **on him**, that **he** sure has a hard decision to make.  
5. He feels entitled to his little safe space where he can pick and choose the fate of your relationship.

To be clear, crushes in relationships happen. You can't help who you're attracted to, it'll happen to you one day too. But this excuses nothing, his behavior is repugnant and narcissistic. You get over a crush by keeping it to yourself, putting distance, and letting it fade. It's just an infatuation that means nothing...unless you make it something. That's exactly what he did, he acted on the crush, he chose to and it is *absolutely* cheating.

You say he's smart, but he comes across as having the emotional intelligence of a 10 year old. He is the center of his own world, his decision only involve his feelings and he can't even handle a crush without going full tilt. You deserve way more than this, you deserve an actual adult, for one, but mostly, you deserve a partner that respects you. You tell his ass that there is *no* decision to make, he already decided and you've already decided how this ends.

TL;DR: DTMFA"
202,"Dude...no. Just no. It's one thing to come out in a committed straight relationship, but him asking you to give up your whole identity to be with him when he isn't even attracted to you and won't really consider you to be his life partner is so selfish. Don't stay. It's so unfair for you to do that to yourself. "
203,"Yes to all of this!!! OP, these people in your life are bringing you down. You’ve changed, but they’ll probably never see it, so it could keep bringing you back to your youth to be around them."
204,"Thank you! It’s a very difficult decision to make. Hopefully, I make the right one. "
205,"If this isn't the first time he's thrown things, it's not out of character. He just manages to hide it. 

Coming off nicotine doesn't completely change your character. It just makes you more irritable. A good person will work harder to not behave like a damn enraged bear, and if necessary isolate themselves. 

This dude instead takes it out on furniture, after being a COMPLETE ASSHOLE about your truly devastating news. "
206,"&gt; He says we’re in different stages of our lives which I agree with but I  don’t want to stay together for another year for him just to break up  with me. 

Then end the relationship now.  If you both know your relationship has an end-date, just rip the bandaid off now and call it off.

&amp;#x200B;"
207,"&gt;I feel it’s fair to ask for enough to cover the mortgage ($550). Am I wrong?

No. That's fair.

&gt;How do I bring this up?

You need to sit down with her and say: I wanted to help you out because you were talking about going through a divorce. I was willing to take a financial hit in order to help you. But things have changed, and I have to rent this house to cover the mortgage. How do you want to handle this? Do you want to move out, and if so when, or do you want to cover the mortgage payment? 

If she agrees to pay rent, have her sign a month-to-month rental contract just to protect yourself. "
208,"From a 'feminist' standpoint,  I would not put up with this nonsense from my husband.  Not for a second.

You have been beyond accommodating.  Now you are being fooled.

Show her this thread.  Make sure she knows in no uncertain terms what she is doing to you.  If she has any interest in saving your marriage, she should cut Gabe off and get into counselling with you.  Anything less, you need to respect yourself and make an exit plan."
209,"There are 2 scenarios here:

1. His family is abusive or something along those lines and isn't really big on the whole meeting the family ordeal

2. He's keeping you secret and doesn't want people to know about you (not saying he's cheating or somthing but I have seen those instances)

Either way he needs to give you a proper reason. Relationships are about compromise. He should be willing to meet your family for you but you don't have to see his family if he doesn't want. 

So communicate with him basically"
210,"The fact that he was jealous and controlling means that he has a tendency to jump to the most uncharitable conclusions. You say you haven't noticed it in him for a while, but that doesn't mean it wasn't there: you have eliminated your male friends, have mostly female colleagues, and gave him access to all your gadgets. He wasn't ""not jealous"", he had full control. 

The thing with jealousy is that it grows, if allowed. Same with control. Somebody who was first ""just uncomfortable with you having lunch with a male friend"", years later, after you alienated all your male friends, can call you a slut for not looking away when George Clooney is on TV. It is possible that he thought he saw something, thought he was onto something, and then thought thought thought and BOOM - the fact that you had your coffee differently from what you usually have, coupled with the fact that you have put your phone face-down the other day, plus the fact that you have received a spam ""dating websites"" email, means that you have been seeing somebody behind his back. 

I am not saying ""oh, this is definitely what this is"", I am just saying that his jealousy MIGHT be a bigger problem than you think, and you didn't notice because he has you completely isolated from males. "
211,My live in partner and I have a rule not to joke about stuff that we are sensitive about. Tell him if he wants to say something about cleaning start with ‘thank you’ and if he has issues with how much you are cleaning to bring them up calmly and not in a joking fashion. 
212,Not a unicorn. My mans is the same way- and you will definitely find someone with more respect for than your current bf.
213,"My best advice for rebuilding your life is to do it as far away from your father as possible. You're an adult, he's a horrible father. There's no law saying you have to have anything to do with yiur father as an adult if you don't want to."
214,Your fiancé needs to deal with this and tell his sister to stop being petty and immature.
215,"Think you’re more than entitled to say no, also why are you with him if he’s still ‘in love’ with his ex??"
216,"If abusive people were always showing their colors, no one would be in relationships with abusive people. They must squeak by somehow, by being nice, like a pretty Venus fly trap. OP, you know what you need to do."
217,"The first thing you need to do is talk to your lawyer and figure out if you even *can* move according to your custody agreement. If you don't have a custody agreement, talk to your lawyer about the best way to get what you want. Get a lawyer and take their advice, and do it before your ex does, because in situations like this, timing can be *everything*.

Edit because I have not had enough coffee and apparently can't type yet."
218,"Yeah, this would be a dealbreaker for me.

In an adult relationship, it's important that your ideals align enough that you could have a copacetic future together. If you want to have kids with him one day, would you be comfortable not vaccinating them? Would he be comfortable vaccinating them? Would he want to teach your kids the same viewpoints that you feel uncomfortable with? Would he expect you to teach them those viewpoints as well? 

The anti-vax/holistic medicine/thinking tap water will poison him things all make me think this would not be a great person to settle down and have kids with. What if one of your kids becomes ill and needs medical treatment? Is he going to take issue with you bringing them to a conventional doctor? "
219,"I doubt that she will be mad. Im willing to bet that after a week the apt will be just like it was before you cleaned.  I also think that you are going to get tired of cleaning after her, and that will cause a strain on the relationship.   Speaking from experience.  I would love it if my bf cleaned for me.  "
220,"So, here's the thing.  Mark isn't an idiot; he knows very well what's going on. He likes the attention from her, and he is prioritizing her feelings over yours.  He is perfectly capable of kindly, politely, establishing boundaries with Erin without impacting his friendship with John, but he doesn't want to. He craves Erin's attention more than he cares about respecting your feelings and your relationship with him.

I'd advise having another conversation with him about this, lay it all out, be clear.  You're uncomfortable with how Erin behaves, you're concerned about the lack of boundaries, you feel unheard, disrespected, and you're worried about the impact this is having on your relationship and your future. How he replies, how his actions change, will determine how you move forward: together, or separately.  "
221,"My then-boyfriend once accidentally gave me a goose egg by drunkenly play-shoving me into a wall. I'm nine inches shorter and about seventy pounds lighter than he is (he's a big, strong guy, I'm a distance runner). 

The next morning, I sat him down and told him the following:

""When I am entering into a relationship with any man, it's important for me to know that I will never, under any circumstances, need to fear the superior strength that he has due to his testosterone. Any man I sleep with could easily hold me down, rape me, or kill me. I understand that you have never had to fear this from a sex partner, and it's probably a pretty foreign concept to wrap your head around. That's why I'm telling you now that I need you to be aware, any time you put your hands on me, that I can't just throw you off. You need to stop instantly when I tell you, and you need to always make sure you are playing gently, even when you are drinking. This is the only way I can feel safe in your home and in your bed.""

He took it to heart and, to this day, has never failed to stop immediately when asked, and to handle me gently. That's one of the many reasons he's my husband now. 

What I'm telling you is that there are men who will take your concerns seriously. There are men who will always take care not to harm you. My partner was 32 when he took me seriously, and your partner is now 34. This isn't a maturity issue. It's a respect issue. He doesn't respect you. And he wants license to hurt you. You've said what you need to. He will not change. What you do now depends on how much you value your health and your life."
222,"Hey OP, while as a woman I can understand her angry position about abortion (especially in these VERY political times where is seems the current US President and his followers are setting a poor example of how women should be treated and viewed) it does seem like something more is going on here.

I can’t quite place it, but it sounds like something else is happening below the surface, and that the religious differences could be an easy cover for something else? I’m not sure why it comes across that way for me.

In any case, whatever is going on sounds like a pretty big incompatibility in your life.

My advice would be to consider both relationships on their own. The 8 year friendship is nothing to diminish, he was a strong support system when you didn’t have one while going through school for a very arduous profession.

In your post, you don’t mention (or maybe I missed it) how long you’ve been with your girlfriend, but you also don’t mention what kind of impact SHE has had on your life. You need to consider both, and that should help steer you in the right direction.

A partner should support you and be supportive of others that support you, even if the fundamental beliefs differ. If they love you, they should at least acknowledge and understand those that also love you since they have that in common, I’d think."
223,"WWLBD?
What would LADYBOSS do?"
224,"&gt; Like, once invited the neighbors over for dinner then told their children Santa isn't real but Catholicism is kind of catholic.

Translation: fucking crazy.

It’s on your boyfriend to salvage what he can of these relationships, but it sounds like as far as the grandparents are concerned, the well is permanently poisoned. It’s not like you can undo the abortion (even if you wanted to), so there’s no path back to “good person” for you in their minds. 

Boyfriend is the one with leverage here, not you. If they want to maintain a good relationship with him, they *at minimum* need to back off of you and be civil in your presence. Give everyone some time to cool off, and then he can make that clear to everyone who is upset. They don’t get to call you names and say nasty things about your character without risking alienating *both* of you. 

But YOU have done all you can to make yourself understood and set reasonable limits on the kind of treatment you’ll accept. The rest is up to him. 

"
225,"All you can really do is tell your boyfriend to stand up for you and the relationship. You can't talk with the friend, because it seems like she wanted to trigger you, so talking to her and telling her that it is not okay for you will only fuel the fire. But your bf seems to have a lot more power over her, if he insists that she stops with it, she will. I have a feeling she wouldn't like to upset your boyfriend, otherwise she wouldn't call him her work-husband (how idiotic btw). Your boyfriend must tell her to stop! There is no other solution."
226,How long have you been dating? He's being completely unreasonable and you did nothing wrong. 
227,"Thanks, I guess I'm falling victim to imposter syndrome and expecting too much from myself. "
228,"I think it's more than fair, but I am curious... If you are the main parent how in the hell is your husband going to care for his own damn kids while you're away?

You two have a litany of other issues to iron out and this is small fry compared to the other red flags you're hoisting up in this post."
229,What are you getting out of this arrangement exactly? Because it sounds like he gets a bang maid who practically pays for the privilege.
230,"&gt;go To His house after a fight about him, be out of contact for 6 hours, and leave a fight about this to go His spin class

This. Unless OP was being the most unreasonable person ever, bookending this crappy night with Gabe Activities is so not ON. If I'm concerned my SO is having an emotional affair (and they most definitely are), and my SO's reaction to this is to *keep plans with the subject of my concern*? Wow, the disrespect. 

And heaven forbid she cancels plans with Gabe and a SPIN CLASS. How dare OP ask her to stop living her authentic, feminist life and not go to a spin class! /so. much. sarcasm 

OP, you are clearly supportive. But you've moved way into doormat territory at this point. She's going to keep pushing boundaries. Is she going to suggest she needs to spend the weekend with him to ""work on their music"" and stomp her foot about your crushing her dreams? More overnight trips? Move in with Gabe and his wife because...swimming? Quit trying to be the Cool Husband. Your wife needs to break up with her boyfriend. "
231,"&gt;I’m more upset about this than the fact that I have cancer.

Maybe your emotions are getting displaced. Sometimes we focus on a detail to avoid dealing with the big picture. It sucks that he isn't more supportive, but turn your focus away from him and take care of yourself. 

Look for other people in your life to depend on. A cancer support group can be really helpful, ask your doctor's office about finding one in your community. "

235,"This happened to my recently divorced mom. A guy she was talking to claimed he was military and was a commanding officer on a secret mission overseas. My mom brought it up to me because both me and my husband are in the military, and conveniently my husband was deployed at the location this guy claimed to be. He even told my mom not to tell me because I was in the military and might report him. I told my mom that it was most likely a scam for money and any commanding officer wouldn't disclose all this secret information to someone he met on a dating site. She was hesitant to believe me and in denial so I did a reverse image search on the photos he sent her and found multiple profiles claiming he was in the military under different ranks and names and actively scamming people out of money. I brought all this evidence to my mom and she was obviously heartbroken. I stayed on the phone with her for hours as she cried. It will be hard, but you need to make sure she is not sending this guy any money because ultimately that is their goal."

Even though I am an elementary teacher, I don't think I would ever even have former students on my personal accounts. The only ones that I follow on social media are ones who I have known the parents personally for years and are well over 21 now. "
237,"Hoo boy this is messy. The Captain Hindsight answer is that you guys should have either stopped using the nickname OR let her in on the joke as soon as it became serious, because this does look sketchy from her end. Not to mention hurtful.

Put yourself in her shoes.

You're dating a guy, it's going well, and things are getting serious. You notice he has a female friend who's significantly younger than him, and he is very close to her. They text and talk all the time. You then find out that they hooked up in the semi-recent past. You're trying to be cool about it, and you tell yourself it's not a big deal (because it isn't). Then you see that he's texting this other woman about spending time with ""Veronica."" All those little moments of jealous suspicion suddenly seem validated. You ask what it means, and you find out that your boyfriend and his female friend have a somewhat unkind nickname that they use to talk about you. An inside joke *of which you are the butt.*

Can't you see how that looks to her? Can you imagine how that feels?

This is on him to fix. But I think it's fair to make yourself available to speak to her (ie, text her and say ""Just wanted to let you know there's nothing going on between him and I, and if you ever have questions or want to talk I'd be glad to discuss it with you."") as you are a part of this."
238,I would suspect him of cheating.  When was the last time you saw his test results?  Insist on seeing his.
239,"He wasted the money himself. He should have maintained the house or not have bought it in the first place. But you are right, playing the blame game is not productive. However: forgive, but do not forget who cause this. "
240,"My ex would whine about sex and guilt me into giving in.

Eventually he got bored of waiting and raped me. Afterwards, he argued it was just “bad sex”.

OP needs to be cautious. Things can go downhill so fast."
241,"You have to admit, it takes a certain amount of skill to completely invalidate someone’s character and abusive history in a single sentence."
242,I've heard that before too. Seeing you more as the mother of his child than for sex.
243,I honestly can’t imagine why he thought anyone he’s not having sex with would need that level of detail. I’d have cringed myself inside out in your shoes.
244,"Lol. I love this. Delicious. 

If she goes to HR, just play dumb and say you wanted to make sure you were doing it right so you went to your car to retrieve your phone to look it up and she drove away. Its not like she was paying enough attention to prove you wrong.

If she tries to argue that I mean. You're welcome to tell HR you were unable to communicate with her because she was sitting in the car with her windows rolled up and she waved you off the one time she spoke to you.

If she ever confronts you? Play dumb if its more comfortable, but you could also say ""I didn't know you'd drive away without me having the chance to tell you the flat tire was still on. There was a miscommunication."""
245,"Silver lining, as least her bad behaviour is coming through now and not after they got back from their honeymoon. OP has a chance to escape with a clean break."
246,"&gt;He would never take those drugs, which means someone must have spiked the punch or something.

That's not how that works.

Sure, there are some assholes who want to watch the world burn and are happy to spike punch with hallucinogens in order watch an entire party go mad...but there are **far** more people who will only part with their drugs in exchange for cash. I am quite certain that your partner, who willingly went to a party where drugs are being handed out like candy, did not get spiked.

&gt;But why burn my clothes? Why burn anything for that matter?

I do not know. But I do think it's very curious that despite being incredibly high, he wasn't so high that he was unable to differentiate between his own possessions and yours.

Just because he doesn't remember doesn't make him any less responsible for his actions. A driver who falls asleep at the wheel is no less responsible for the damage they cause because they were asleep when it happened. Your boyfriend owes you a new wardrobe and then some."
247,Seriously.  Just bring out someone to consult on repairs for the house.  They'll probably call code enforcement for you.
248,"Two big red flags here:

1. She's embarrassed of your (very impressive!) job, meaning she's a snob *and* she hasn't really bothered to learn much about what you're doing for work.
2. She's willing to flat-out lie to make herself look good. And this isn't a tiny lie; this is big. If I found out a friend had told me that her SO was a law student when he really wasn't, I would be horrified. That person would probably not be my friend any longer. If she'll lie about your job, what else will she lie about? This is not normal behavior and would be a deal-breaker for me.

I think you should dump her. It's only been four months and she already wants you to go along with an insane falsehood. Having a girlfriend isn't worth it. You might have better luck with online dating, which you can do on your own schedule. Good luck!"
249,"Wow. I think you really need to have a sit-down with your husband to unpack this because this does not bode well for the future. Your weight is likely gonna fluctuate over a lifetime together. You're gonna get wrinkles. Your boobs will sag. Your hair will grey.

If he's this bothered by you gaining some weight during the process of housing and nourishing his child inside your body, how is he going to function as you age? And what happens if you don't get back down to your pre-pregnancy weight? I mean great if you do, but if you only lose a max of 10lbs? Is he just never going to have sex with you again?

If he's being this hard line about a nominal amount of weight gained over the course of the pregnancy imo he has incredibly unrealistic expectations of what a life with a human woman should look like.

Sit him down, talk to him, talk about **your** goals and a reasonable timeline for them, as well as what he can do to help you achieve those goals especially given that he wants the weight loss. I'd also have a frank discussion with him about how unreasonable and immature he's being though you may want to offset those two conversations. If he's not willing to hear you, or to help you may need to speak with a counselor together and go from there."
250,"Allegations of inappropriate conduct between a teacher and a student, even if unsubstantiated and/or completely fabricated, can be career-ending.

Your wife is making unwise choices in her attempts to be accessible to students; she likely has an official email address as part of her employment, and if students have questions related to schoolwork, they should contact her through that (or through some other school-sponsored official channel) so that there is 1) no question about attempts to hide the communication, and 2) an official record of all of the communication, both for her protection and the students'.

"
251,"TL/DR. Just call a lawyer and leave, dude. "
252,"&gt; I didn't think it could get any worse.

If you are having a thought like this about ANYONE, do not marry that person!"
253,"A rule of thumb I've learned to live by is:

A person who is nice to *you* but not nice to the waiter is *not* a nice person.

The reason for this is because a person who is rude or nasty to service people:

1. Has it in them to be a nasty person to others, and
2. Does it to service people because s/he knows that they have no recourse but to submit because their jobs are on the line, which further means:
3. S/he is only being nice to *you* because if s/he knows that *you* have the freedom not to put up with that sort of abuse.

There's nothing wrong with having high standards, and to (for instance) holding a restaurant to them by asking them to remake something they have made wrong.  But it's a *huge* red flag to call the waiter and manager over and berate them loudly; that's not frugality, that's a sign of a horribly spiteful and nasty person.

You are not over-reacting.

If she does this to wait staff, she'll eventually do it to *you*, when she perceives herself to be in a position of power over you."
254,It sounds like SHE is the one shaming YOUR sexuality for not wanting to do something she suggested.... Not only that but assuming you would be into it just because you date women is also extremely rude. You're not an experiment you are a human with feeling and not necessarily into polyamorous sexual encounters. You can still hang out with the others in your friend group but maybe branch out a bit and find some other friend groups?? If you want to answer her back let her know that while she thought you were sex shaming her she was intact sex shaming you. That isn't a friend. 
255,"It is absolutely relevant that your parents announced the end of their marriage right as your marriage began.  Even if they had an awful relationship it was still a foundational relationship in your life.  I imagine part of what is going through your head must have been ""Well, my parents can stick together in spite of everything, I guess anyone can make it work"" and suddenly that was blown to pieces right when you were at one of what should be the happiest times of your relationship with your wife.  Lots of people can also have post wedding anxiety of ""Well, we are married, now what?""


Keep in mind your wife married you because she loves you and you two are not your parents.  See a therapist, even if you are an adult and not a child, parents going through a nasty divorce is a painful thing.  They will help you dealing with that and hopefully with your anxiety from that about your new marriage (your wife sounds lovely and I wish you both the best)."
256,"“Yet”? Wtf you’re only 19 lol 
"
257,"I was in your situation once. I was all set to go to college and my boyfriend asked me to move to the other side of the country because he was stationed there after basic. I thought about it and I knew the logistics of it were do able, but in the end I decided to do my own thing. It’s been seven years since I was facing that decision and I don’t even recognize the person I was at that age. So glad I didn’t uproot my life before I knew any better."
258,"That’s a great big nope. Don’t risk it all for him. It’s hard to maintain a military relationship and he’s already demonstrated he’s not able to be faithful during the honeymoon period, which is when it should theoretically be easiest. Plus he’s not taking your concerns seriously? Not an appropriate candidate for lifelong commitment. Don’t take risks like that for a temporary boyfriend."
259,Open up dude it's way easier to live with no unnecessary weight on ur shoulder
260,"PoGo is, at this point, a realm in which he doesn't have to pretend. He doesn't feel he has to fake anything, because he *is* good at it/the game doesn't really require any skill. Anyone who just keeps grinding can get to level 40.  

&gt; I just wish life was like Pokemon and he would spend time doing tasks and getting rewarded the same as the game.

I mean, if you both think that could help there's no reason why you can't set up some kind of reward system. He might also like HabitRPG or any of the other apps that gamify getting your adult shit done. "
261,"so i think the parents hate you anyway and are looking a reason, but shit, dude - you need to get a handle on this punching-people-who-wake-me-up thing.

i get that it's not your fault, but this is going to happen again and again. imagine if you had kids? what if there was an emergency and someone had to wake you? i think her parents could think the world of you, yet still find this a deal-breaker.

you need to seek help on this issue."
262,"Anyone who wears a cat on their head is automatically my close friend, even if I've never met them before."
263,"&gt;And then as I find all this out, she says she’s pregnant and that she knows it’s mine because he never came inside of her, so I feel as if I have to give her another chance for the child.

After all the lying she's already done, why on Earth would you take her word on something as important as this at face value??"
264,"&gt; WHO JUST FUCKS OFF TO A VACATION WHILE THEIR WIFE IS PREGNANT AND ABOUT TO DELIVER

at least one other dimwit husband on this sub... the guy scheduled a 'guy's week' over his wife/baby's delivery date and couldn't understand why it was a problem (sorry looked for the post but couldn't find it)"
265,"Has he ever been aggressive with you like that before? 

You said you haven't cheated on him, but that doesn't mean that he hasn't for some reason concluded that you have. Perhaps he found something/thought he found something? Has he ever been quick to jump to conclusions? Is he generally jealous? Controlling? Possessive? Having sex with you first and then throwing you out comes across as a plan to humiliate you, to make you feel cheap. It suggests a disturbing level of anger. 

Another possibility (if this is, indeed, out of character) is a health issue. Aggression, paranoia, delusions- they can all be symptoms of a physical condition. 

Lastly... Regardless of what he thinks his ""reasons"" were, he spat on you and he physically threw you out of bed - that's physical abuse. You absolutely have to protect yourself at this point, because things escalated with no warning into something that has put you in danger. Next time you might not get a warning before you are punched. Before you know what it is you are dealing with, have somebody with you if you intend to see him. 

**EDIT**: there's a ""victim-blaming"" alert circling around this thread. To that person I have this: trying to explain an abuser's thought-pattern is NOT victim-blaming (especially not when the OP herself asked for speculations). Understanding what could have led to the assault not only provides closure, but also **teaches to look for the same traits and behaviours (red flags) in any future partners**. It is important for personal growth - if you have the misfortune of falling a victim, you might as well learn how to spot and avoid an abuser. "
266,That is rude af. You need to stand up for your damn self and your partner and tell these people to keep their rude comments about your bf's looks to themselves. WTF
267,"It's not appropriate to expect the friend to buy your family dinner whenever he extends the offer to your boyfriend (like the pizza idea).  

But it's pretty fucked up that your boyfriend regularly brings that food home and eats it in front of the kids when they or you don't get to partake.  It's just plain unkind, really.  Why can't they eat at the restaurant, in the park, in the car?  Why put the family in a position where they have to sit there feeling envious?  Talk about insensitive."
268,"What could you possibly ask for that he could realistically deliver? Do you really think he can quit being abusive, belittling, misogynistic, and an unapologetic rapist in any reasonable time frame?  Do you want to be dating someone who's an abusive misogynistic rapist?

Now may not seem like a great time to dump him, but it's never going to seem like a great time to dump him.  It's always easy to find reasons to procrastinate on hard jobs.  Don't do that.  You're young.  Don't waste your 20s on him.  Dump him **now**.

&amp;#x200B;"
269,""" What am I doing wrong? ""

You listed a ton of stuff he is doing wrong, and all the ways you have told him that he's hurting you, and that he doesn't change. So the only thing YOU'RE doing wrong is staying with him.

The way you show him your pain isn't up for debate is by leaving him - not as a bargaining chip, I mean leave him for real, and block him, and never see or communicate with him again. 

You think the problem is that you just haven't found the magic words to make him see how he's hurting you. What you don't get is that he DOES know he hurts you. He just doesn't CARE (or worse yet, he LIKES that he can hurt you and you just keep taking it)."
270,A few weeks a month.... so... most of the month? E.g. most of the time?
271,"*Everything* in Hawaii ain't no joke. Just existing on an isolated tropical paradise is expensive as fuck. Out of state tuition, housing, gas, food, cost of living in general. It's bonkers. The difference compared to Texas would be shocking."
272,"Bring him to the doctors with you.  Explain to your doctor that the weight gain caused by the medication is ruining your marriage and distressing your husband.

Have the doctor discuss the alternatives to this medication with both of you.  Have the doctor explain to your husband the consequences of not treating this illness.  

If your husband would prefer a dead wife to a slightly overweight wife, that is useful information to know."
273,Thanks. You put some things in perspective for me. 
274,"It's complete manipulation. If he plays the ""wounded one"" when she says no, it guilts her into giving him what he wants. 

I find it disturbing that anyone would have sex knowing their partner doesn't want it, even if they eventually give in and agree. "
275,"To be honest you're not being rude, but don't expect her to pay you back. Maybe you can make a little trip out of it still."
276,"To me it sounds like he does believe the abuse happened, but he puts it in a similar category as normal ""women talking shit about their ex"" stuff.

Kind of like when bad male behavior is spotlighted as part of Me Too, such as groping or sexual harrassment, and some guys say, ""jeez, next thing you know, men can't ask a girl out anymore, or flirt, or make eye contact, or have consensual sex without signing a contract. I don't know how to behave in this strange new landscape of dating! I'm gonna get in trouble if I do anything at all!""

If anything, it’s gross of both Brie and brad to propose something like that to someone they don’t even know that well."
278,Do not stay with her. Even if it ends up being your kid... try take care of your child  but DO NOT stay in a relationship with this woman.
279,Has he ever heard of the concept of positive and negative reinforcement? He's punishing your effort. Maybe work that into the conversation.
280,He raped her and then she tried to console him. 
281,"Brie is not your friend.  

She's trying to shame you into sex with her and her boyfriend, and I don't think it's an accident that you're so young. 

&gt;I don’t know if I’m taking it too personally but I keep feeling like after Brie hanging out with me for a month and us being pretty friendly, she just saw me as a prop for her and her gross boyfriend? 

Sorry Op, but I think this was it. I'd do your best to block them from your life as much as you can."
282,"I've been in a similar situation before.

Here's my feeling: You get to play the ""Let's Just Be Friends!"" game twice with people. Any more than that and you're just lying (to yourself, and her).

The first time isn't your fault.  You met her as a friend, feelings arose, you were honest, and she said ""Let's be pals.""  You agree and give it a shot.  From here, there's two paths:  1) You make the friendship work or 2) You try and make it work, but you can't move on.

At that point, you can try one more time out the door to see if she's harboring a secret love for you, but that's it.  If it's a no, it's time to bounce, which you're doing.  Because to stick around any further is a lie.  You CAN'T be friends. You tried, but failed. You're not actually friends anymore. You're a delusional suitor in waiting.  You're doing a disservice to both her AND you if you continue to loiter around under what we've determined is a totally false pretense.

So yeah, you're doing the right thing here by nipping this in the bud now from your end.  You had your second at-bat. It's time to vanish as politely as you can. Observe the campsite rule: try to leave her in as good a condition as you found her.  It sounds like you are, so good on you.  Eyes forward and good luck with your new life."

286,Absolutely tell her sooner than later. 
287,"It sounds like you actually were not a freak at all as a kid. What you see as odd and disturbing behavior is one that often comes from abuse. Your sister pushed your boundaries, got you to tell her whatever she wanted to hear and know. You wanted her love so badly that you ignored the fact that you never had a good relationship, that she was looking for dirt on you probably, and enjoyed a sense of power over you by withholding love and affection and intimacy. Your reaction is common with people that are chasing after someone who is withholding those things from you. And because you both had abusive parents, your relationship between the two of you was dysfunctional. And it still is. 

First, you need to stop chasing after her love, approval and validation. Shes not giving it. She enjoys knowing she can deny you want you want. Its a position of power for her. And your parents are still abusive. 

Second, you are right in that there isnt much of anything of value for you in that abusive, dysfunctional family. Its just hard to give up that hope, which will never come to fruition, that your parents and your sister love, approve and want you. You have to grieve for the family you never had. For the childhood you should have had with love and support. And for the adult that still needs that and is at risk for abusive relationships. Its really good that you have the therapy in place. 

But grieving and acceptance of people for who they are rather then hoping for who they coulda, woulda, shoulda been is hard. Its a process. And stop thinking there is any such validity in you being a ""teenage freak"". Those are just words used to abuse you. And your Sister is a part of that dysfunctional dynamic. Not separate from it. 

Sometimes we get stuck with a crappy family of origin. We can jettison them, grieve for what you should have had, and then find, over time, a family of choice. Of people that have your back, that are part of a reciprocal relationship of give and take. That respect you, and care for you and treat you with kindness and empathy. Expect no less. And continue to work to grieve, and to build up your self esteem, confidence and boundaries where they should have been had you had a healthy family that supported and loved you. And take back your life, make it yours. You can check on the sub justnofamily for posts about your Sister and family. You can also check out the sub raisedbynarcissists. They have people who have been through the abuse you have and are supportive. You dont have to be alone anymore. You are far from alone. "
288,"With two careers and 2.9 kids, planning is essential. He can't just plan random weeks off without consulting you. Especially as the kids get older and have more scheduling constraints due to school and activities, parents coordinating with each other is critical. Your husband needs to understand that he's no longer single or married with no kids. 

If the issue is purely logistical, you can get a paper planning calendar or use an online one to coordinate. My wife and I plan at a minimum 2 months out and some events/conferences/meetings/etc. we know more than a year in advance. We try to sync up every few weeks and alert each other when new things pop up. But they always get put into the master calendar. It's a disaster to try to run a multi-career multi-kid household without this kind of planning. 

If the issue is more about his attitude, then you have a bigger problem on your hands. Again he needs to understand that he is no longer single or married with no kids. What he does with his schedule impacts everyone in the family. The problem isn't him wanting some alone-time vacation, the problem is that he is not coordinating his activities with you.

292,"I would add another “c” to that, which is “collaboration”."
293,"Yikes.

My first reaction to this is that he got tired of dealing with this and wanted to make it someone else's problem. Gifting it to you keeps it in the family so it doesn't seem like he made such a terrible investment decision.

The bottom line is **you two are not ready for marriage.**

Dude, you haven't even been dating for a year yet and **you've already been dumped twice by her.** On/off is a terrible idea.

You can't communicate without starting a fight. You don't know her well enough to understand her needs, and she doesn't trust you and doens't communicate well enough to express her needs.

How can you marry someone that you don't even know how to help? You are still figuring out how to *talk to her about a bad day* how on *earth* do you expect to be able to navigate more sensitive issues as a married couple? How can you talk about finances, where to live, children, religion, career, death of parents, *if you can't even ask about her day?*

Seriously, please take the engagement off the table. You two don't know each other well enough at all to be getting married. I'm not saying you shouldn't be together (tho TBH I don't see this ending well based on the on/off relationship and how poor the communication is between you two), but no matter what you **need to slow this down.** You've been dating less than a year and you've broken up twice, yet you decided to propose and rush a wedding that's just a few months away? Where's the fire?"

300,"Broker here. I am piggybacking on your reply because I want to offer you some valuable advice. 

If it is your's- deed in your name- sell it asap. Someone else can snatch up the lot and use it to build something new. 

I know a lot about real estate- it is all I have done for 19 years- and this house is not salvageable. It would take A LOT of know-how and money to make it safe for occupancy. If your dad still has name on the house, get bids to show him how much it is going to cost and show him a comparative market analysis (a CMA) by a licensed broker with a good reputation in your town. Convince him that selling is simply what makes sense, and show him how you plan to invest the proceeds. Perhaps a down-payment on a new home/condo? Vanguard retirement account? Jump over to r/personalfinance, and they can help you there. 

There is money to be made here, just not the way your dad thinks there is.  "

Girl do you have no common sense?? I know you can't change the past, but really? You really thought a solid relationship was 2 hours a day and no overnights, enough to get pregnant a SECOND time with this guy?

And I KNOW your friends and family were saying things to you about this. Next time, listen to them.

All I can say is put your big girl pants on and find you a good lawyer and go after him for child support. You've had your blinders on for way too long, and you're going to have to be a lot smarter than you've been."
308,"Act very happy with your life and when they ask you why you don't have a girlfriend, tilt your head, look at them and say ""Why do you ask?"" and keep answering their questions with the same question: ""Why do you want to know?""  ""Why?"" ""Is this something you need to know?"""

311,"It's a trick.  If you deny that you had botox than, to her, you are somehow criticizing the services your mother provides because her customers are vain/aging/weak/whatever.  By protesting your youth and vitality, you suggest that your Mom is propping up the opposite end.  

On the other hand, if you let it slide, she continues to make insinuations that, in your 20s, you are just sooooo vain/weak/whatever.  It's a way for her to put you down and maintain a superior, judgmental stance in the family over you.  (And, hey, I'm not judging.  Id be down for some botox and spas are the bomb.  All power to your Mom.)

So, change the game.  People who Mean Girl try to get away with saying snarky crap without being open with their hostility.  They want to be able to claim that they were ""misunderstood"" when challenged.  So, feel free to make her uncomfortable when she pulls this crap.  ""I don't understand.  Can you explain further?  I'll wait.  I'm just really confused by what you mean.""  Keep at it until she drops it.  

Or, pull away at some of her deniability.  ""Actually, you've suggested this wrongly before.  I've not had Botox, but I don't have a problem with women who do.  Does it make you uncomfortable that women have Botox?  Sometimes, people are negative about stuff that they are actually curious about.  If you are curious about Botox, I can point you towards some helpful sources.""  (And hey, suggest this possibility to your MiL too if you want to shut down the family rumour mill.)"
312,"You are leaving out significant parts of the story based on your post history. You married someone from a different country (japan it looks like), a different religion (heavily religious it appears), and you’ve been having those issues on top of these. 

These are significant factors in what’s going on. Japan, even now, has significantly different ideas of gender roles for the modern woman and I can’t imagine what she feels about the idea of working because of her cultural background. You don’t appear to be looking for advice but validation. 

With that in mind you need far more help then what reddit can provide. You’ve got significant cultural divides, possible mental health issues, financial imbalance, as well as religious divide. There is no easy fix. I doubt she plans on leaving you but neither of you will find happiness with out forging an intensely rough road"
313,"It sounds like he completely forgot about your anniversary.  While it's nice that he replaced the pan, it shouldn't have been an anniversary gift.  You could talk to him about how you feel like buying a replacement pan isn't a gift, it was something he agreed to do anyways.  Gifts are supposed to be things that people enjoy, not stuff for the household that he's going to be using anyways.  He basically bought himself a present if he's going to call it a gift."

&amp;#x200B;

Like someone else said, i dont think it is your opinions/experiences that comes across as offending, it is how your phrase them. Like with the car seat thing ask an open question question highligting your own ignorance instead: ""My parents never used child car seats when i was that age, for what age do they make child car seats?"". Open questions generally come across as less aggressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

But also, i find that parents very very rarely take well to their parenting decisions being questions regardless of what those decisions are. If a parent wont go out because they say the have to care for their teenage baby they will get offended if you question them. Likewise if a parent has no problem leaving their 6-year old alone while they go out have drinks they will also get offended if that is being questioned. When it comes to parents and how they treat their kids: just bite your tongue. Unless you know the person well enough that you know they wont get offended... Or you dont care if they get offended or not. "

Hope your husband isn't this rigid about most things where you are this confused how to talk to him.  This may be a sign that counseling is a good place for y'all to lean some tools before communication becomes a bigger roadblock later.

I don't even understand why it's an issue. If you are off work, you should want to be with your kiddo, even if place was open... how does your husband not want that too? :(

She's overprotective in my opinion and mixing that with the fact that he's an only child is causing poor socialization :( I just can't say this to her without her losing her shit at me/anyone else who brings it up.  "
336,"Basically you guys have skipped the steps of learning how you two work together. There's no easy fix to this because a relationship is really about finding compromises in everything and if either person isn't willing to compromise, then it's going to fall apart.

350,"DEAR GOD JUST **TELL HIM**

Incident one:

&gt;One night a few weeks ago, and this was after my boyfriend and I had been playing Overwatch that evening, we ended up in the bedroom. Everything went as normal and in a way that I am totally happy and satisfied with- that is, until he climaxed. It was actually just before he climaxed...he shouted out this quote from the game we had been playing that night....seriously...this totally ruined the mood for me! **I didn't say anything** because he has never done this before and I wasn't angry so much more just not amused. **I think he could tell** as well but he just laughed it off.


Incident two:

&gt;This one incident honestly wouldn't have bothered me much but it didn't stop there. Several days later in the bedroom he shouted out again before climaxing and this time it really frustrated me. I didn't talk to him afterwards and pretty much rolled over and went to sleep. The morning after **he brought it up and asked if I had a problem at which point I just told him that I wasn't into it before I left** for university.


Sorry but this is on you. 

Your BF did this two separate times and also asked you directly the second time if something was wrong and you expected him to read your mind (the first instance) and to infer how upset you were from a noncommittal answer (the second instance).

Stop hoping he figures it out and just tell him. If he still won't stop *then* be mad."
351,I don't know how you could go six months without even mentioning this information to somebody that you were close to. You chose to actively lie about this and conceal something large happening in your life. That's a huge breach of trust. How is she supposed to trust you after this?

356,I'm just going to say it - that was a stupid and shortsighted vow. Life is long and unpredictable. He's shown what's important to him. You need to sit down and have a discussion about what's important to you and to him after you made that vow 11 years ago.

358,"You're right to be furious at him about it. He seems immature and shortsighted to not leave some cash for you to go eat something. As well as him not bringing his phone with him.

Okay, I think you need to calibrate your thinking on this. Your cousin is the one choosing to destroy the relationship over this. Yes, it's not good to announce a pregnancy before the pregnant person is ready -- but an accident is an accident. It's not like you blasted it all over Facebook. 

Stop bending over backward for someone who is ""proud"" of icing people out. Your cousin clearly gets some sick satisfaction from having her loved ones scrape and grovel for her mercy. By texting her and trying to get her to hang out with you again, you're feeding that beast HARD. I think that you are holding onto the idealized version of your cousin you have in your head, the one who would just be nice and awesome if you could avoid little mistakes like this. But she's not that person. She's choosing to be the person who torches a 30 year relationship over a slip of the tongue. *That's who she is.* 

Think hard about what you really want out of all this, because she WILL be the type to forbid her child from playing with yours to get back at you for some other dumb slight. "

376,"One of my friends boyfriends is seriously one of the most unattractive people I have ever met in real life.

She thinks hes so handsome, she is enamored by everything he says and does, he treats her amazing and she is SO HAPPY.

The difference between this situation and yours is that I never said anything to her because I am not a piece of shit who talks down about other people to their SO's or anyone really... 

This seems like more of a friend problem than a boyfriend problem... however if its getting to you I think it means one of two things 

1) you were already feeling that way anyway and they are just solidifying it 

2) you are worried about and care about what people think of you too much and should work on that 

in either of those cases its not really fair to him especially if you are not sticking up for him or yourself in those situations. "

398,"I’m gonna take a slightly different route here and hope I don’t get flamed for it.

It sounds like the terms of your marriage were, explicitly, husband = breadwinner, wife = housekeeper and child raiser. It doesn’t sound like you qualified that with an “unless circumstances change and we need a second income” (understandable if you were young and lacked foresight). You divvied up the labor and that was that. 

Now you’re changing the terms of your marriage. And it sounds like you didn’t ease into that *at all*. You went from “stay home and raise the kids” to “jump back into the work force” without really having a discussion or exploring other options. And it sounds like your wife’s resistance is largely born of fear. It’s not easy to jump back into the work force after two decades of being out of it. Even the process of APPLYING to jobs has changed drastically in that time frame. Your wife may have no idea where to start, and be terrified of failing and confirming to you and to herself that she can’t do it. If your finances weren’t so dire that you risked not being able to afford necessities, I can see why she was reluctant to risk that humiliation for a little extra in the bank. 

I’m not saying she shouldn’t have tried. She should have. But I AM saying that what you’re asking isn’t as simple as a snap of the fingers. There’s a lot to unpack here, and if you want your marriage to work, you need to unpack it together instead of making unilateral demands. Talk to your wife - does she feel she already has her hands full with the kids? Does she worry she won’t be able to find work, or that she won’t be able to perform if she does? Does she resent the fact that she thought you’d settled the division of labor, only to find out that you felt entitled to change it without discussion? Try to figure out where she’s coming from, instead of assuming that she’s lazy or entitled. 

Of course, this is all contingent on your knowledge of your wife. Is she an otherwise reasonable person? Has she pulled her weight domestically? Does she otherwise work hard and do right by your family? If this is the only sticking point in your marriage, approach her with the benefit of the doubt, and try to get back on the same page. 

Unless you’ve just totally lost interest in her and the trust is gone. In which case, yeah, don’t drag this out. "
399,"Seriously. My husband and I have been married for 5 years. Neither have us have asked or worried about testing since we were engaged 7 years ago. It'd be one thing if they were poly, but if you're monogamous with your spouse, there's no need for frequent testing outside of your routine physical exams."
400,You’ve got yourself a mooch. 
401,"From another perspective. My parents lived the same way until my dad's industry started to fail. In the 90s his industry got him $20/hour starting. Through the 2000s it dropped to about $13/hour with experience. She didn't want to get a job since she was the only one maintaining the house and kids, he insisted. She got a job that was longer hours and more work than his in return for more money than he made. He did not pick up the slack. The house fell apart. We got roaches and maggots in the kitchen he blamed her because a man shouldn't have to clean the house. My mom got sick and needed hospital care. He didn't pick up the slack the house got worse. I finally convinced them to separate. He cleaned up the house after she left as ""proof"" that the house was messy because of her all along. She might see her end of the original bargain as non-negotiable, or she might realize OP doesn't value her domestic work enough to know how much work she puts in. She might know the house will go to shit if she works. OP, you know you'll likely need to do more housework if she gets a job right?  Unless she's sitting around doing nothing all day anyway. "
402,[deleted]
403,Point out the double standard and ask him why you need to get tested more often than he does.
404,"His ex doesn't attend these parties/events too, does she?

Is there something about this group of friends that is very \*different\* from you that your boyfriend might interpret to mean that you would not only NOT fit in but that you would actively dislike these people? Like, are they all Montagues and you're a Capulet? Do they all have purple spots but you have yellow stripes?

It's legit suspicious. 

If you live with your boyfriend, why don't you offer to host a party for some of these friends at YOUR house? Like, make it a fun evening in, instead of going out to bars. Cook some good food and have a nice selection of beer. Can you see what your BF does with that suggestion?"
405,"He needs therapy, ASAP. 

Some of the language here is quite concerning. Is he a suicide risk? Is there someone who can check on him?

Life happens, but this sense of shame at ""failure"" seems excessive. He's no help to you if you divorce, that just means twice as much in the way of expenses. If that's the only reason then this seems like he's trying to drive you away. "
406,"OP, you are not a giving orgasms machine. You are a person, and he has to respect the NO. "
407,"She's the one who should be worried. You are just living your life and choosing what you want, she's forcing herself into a bizarre copycat game because she feels inferior to you and feels forced to match anything you do. Meanwhile she's neglecting her own interests, so that's unhealthy for her.

You have already expressed your concern for her. Now live your life, and let her do whatever she does with hers. And don't feel pressured to look after her career just because she forced herself into being a competitor in your field."
408,"She is doing this to get a rise out of you.  She’s a jealous, petty, mean person.  People like this only feel good when they drag others down to their level.  They like creating drama to keep themselves in the center of attention.  

The best way to deal with people like this is to deny them the fuel they need to stoke their own ego.  

Her: “Must be nice to get free Botox!”
You: “What a silly thing to say!” With an amused smile, then turn back to whatever other conversation you were having. 

Her: “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone!”
You: “Ok” shrugs and talks to someone else. 

Treat her like a silly little kids who says completely outrageous things for laughs. Because that’s basically what she is doing.  If she gets especially mean, you also treat her like a little kid.  “That was a rude thing to say.”  “Wow, you must be so embarrassed that you said that out loud.”  

The key is to deliver these lines with as little emotion as possible.  She is at best mildly amusing and at worst mildly annoying.  She’s inconsequential to your life.  

And yes, it’s up to your fiancé to stand up for you to his family, and have a serious conversation about treating you with respect.  But that doesn’t mean you have I just sit back and take her crap silently.  It’s a dual strategy...a lack of reaction from you AND a stern talking to from him.  

"
409,I informed a girl her bf cheated with me. They ganged up against me and harassed me for a whole year. Do it anonymously if you must. Just know the conversation will be between him and her and he might spin the shit out of this and she might be a psycho chick. 
410,"Know that this zero chance that my mom has a reddit account, but I could see her reading this and responding in this exact way. It makes me happy knowing there is a sweet mom out there taking a moment to care and well wish some internet strangers "
411,You should see a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and ask for their input. Please don't put your daughter's life in the hands of Reddit.
412,"""BF! What the actual fuck. Has it occurred to you that putting this much effort and stress into a random chicky's christmas gift when you just get me a gift card or take me to the mall is insulting? And that's the good version of what's going on. The bad version is that I wonder if you are having an emotional affair."""
413,"I’d say “hey babe. I saw this letter. What’s up with this?”

Inside, I’d be fuming. It would end my relationship if my boyfriend not only didn’t tell me he had a kid, but he never saw his kid. Absent fathers aren’t ok in this household and I’d be praying there was a good explanation. "
414,I'm very glad for you but especially for your children. Having a person like that as a primary figure in your life can be extremely scarring.
415,"You can’t just “make it go away“, but you can understand the context and hopefully he’ll understand, and once you get settled enough you can find a good therapist who can help you with the PTSD. DH and I have been working with such a therapist on and off for a while, and she has helped both of us tremendously.

*You have many more joyous occasions ahead of you and it would be wonderful if you could really enjoy them.*"
416,I call bullshit on this dude.
417,"I think you should carry on being nonchalant and if she says you obsess over her, tell her to keep her ego in check and ask for examples. When she brings up the past say ""yeah right, I was just trying to be nice"" or say you were a kid."
418,"Wow. Run. Fast and far. You don't need this kind of crap. 

If this happened on a first date, would there have been a second?

His behavior isn't going to change and has a high probability of getting worse. You deserve better."
419,"First of all, you poor thing!  NGL, hearing that would be an absolute punch in the gut to me too.  Hugs.  I bet you're beautiful.
  
That said, if you've described what he said accurately and he's never said anything else like it before, I can juuuust about see where he made a stupid joke with a grain of truth in it that came out really, really, REALLY wrong.  (The quiet, sheepish apology afterward would suit this theory.)  
  
So once you've collected yourself, I think you should 1) definitely let him know how much that hurt your feelings! and 2) not let him sidetrack you by beating himself up or saying it was nothing/he didn't mean it, but try to get to the bottom of it.  What does he find attractive about you?  (He should come up with a long, detailed list here, LOL!) What, specifically, about the way you look during Ladytime does he find especially sexy?  Help him understand that this could SO EASILY have been a huge win for him - imagine if he'd said ""Wow, NoSwim1, you are looking so glowing and luscious right now, it's all I can do not to throw you down on that bed, you sexy goddess.""  Ask him how he'd feel if he thought you only found him attractive when he was unavailable for sex, and otherwise he's ""plain old (husband).""  Ask him how he'd feel about having to beg you for sex.  
  
If he's willing to accept that he used very bad judgment and chose a very stupid and clumsy way to open the conversation, you two could really get some good communication about what you desire and appreciate about each other going on.  (And if he's really thinking, some flowers addressed to ""my sexy wife"" tomorrow would really be a smart move, because come ON, guy.)"
420,"Your brother, in addition to his other kinks, might have that thing where he's really into telling other people about his kinks without warning them or obtaining their consent first.

If that's the case, he's either going to grow out of it (sometimes people do grow out of the need to tell other people about their sex lives) or he's not. I think that you should stick to your boundaries about not hearing about your brother's latest foray into dressing in a latex french maid outfit and cleaning the toilets with a toothbrush. Being accepting of who your sibling is as a person doesn't mean having to hear about it."
421,"""I didn't want you to read into it""

""So you admit that its weird and there's something to read into?"""
422,"This is good. I think a close friend will also realize that this is a topic that there is no real ""right time"" to bring up."
423,"First cut contact, block him on everything.

Dive into work/school/friends/family/hobbies whatever. Keep yourself busy.

OP you dodged a bullet here, he showed you who he was and what his priorities were before you were legally married and/or had children. At least at the end of the day you can be happy about that. "
424,"Well, the first step would be to talk to him about why he said it, what he meant by it, and how it made you feel."
425,"The vast majority of the time, when people ask whether it makes sense to try again on a relationship after a breakup, the answer is ""no, it does not make sense"", because in most of those cases, the people involved in the relationship have not changed, and the circumstances have not changed, and so the things that led to a breakup *before* are still there and will lead to a breakup *again*.

But in this case, it sounds as if you really put in the work to change your behavior after your last post.  So it's possible (*possible*) that it is worth trying again; the circumstances and the players have changed, so in essence it could be a whole new ballgame.

If you *want* to, and you feel that the progress on yourself is real and will last, then give it a shot.  But do as you have done: let her set the pace.  That way you won't have to worry that you are ""forcing her into a relationship""."
426,"Can you get a lock for your door to protect your things? Or put things that are important to you in a storage unit?

Tell your SO and friends that if they see your mother calling that they are to screen her and not pick up. "
427,"one thing you may want to consider is encouraging your gf to see a therapist or something about her eating disorder. Binge eating is a eating disorder and people who recover from restrictive habits can sometimes swing too far and begin to develop BED. 

If you think her eating habits and weight are tied more to her emotions than her physical hunger I suggest you two explore that either through conversation or through her talking to a health professional. 

I wouldnt tell her to lose weight tho- I would express this problem as a concern for her emotional health. 

I personally struggled in highschool with restricting and still do occasionally now. However I also swung to the other side for a while and ate all my negative or difficult emotions. Since I began journaling or even just talking aloud to myself before eating 'am I hungry right now- is there something upsetting me that is making me want to eat ect.' and asking myself these questions I've lost 30 lbs healthily. 

Best of luck"
428,"I’m sure she wants time off for her sanity also. Or is she just expected to do everything as well, and not even be a consideration to him. ? 

I don’t think we should be jumping to conclusions about divorce here. But I would most definitely be putting my foot down. Requesting firmly that there are better communication lines and coordination between you both. If you guys are unable to resolve the matter yourselves. Then I would look to getting some relationship counselling. "
429,"&gt;I’ve told him he hurt me and he will fight me on it, scoff, or hit me again to show how he didn’t hurt me.

So his response to hurting you... is deliberately hurting you again, worse?  And this happens ""countless times""?

This is abuse.   You need to leave."
430,"Drugs are a reason, not an excuse.   It doesn’t matter that he was high - he still did it.  He needs to make reparations."
431,Your boyfriend is pressuring you into sex on a regular basis--I'd be much more worried about the lack of consent than the timing! But keeping you from sleeping is crummy too. You should absolutely not date this guy. 
432,"You need to talk to your sister about the consequences of the nude photos. I would find some articles about kids getting charged with child porn laws for making and distributing these nudes. Do it from a place of concern and make it clear that while you don't care about her having and sharing nudes once she turns 18, she is putting herself in legal hot water with her actions now."
433,"This seems like a really good opportunity for your band, and even though you aren't a fan of the band you're touring with or the new direction of your band, it would be pretty shitty of you to back out on your bandmates so close to this tour.  Would it be possible for you to hold a band meeting and tell your bandmates that you are going to join them on this tour, but after that you will be leaving the band to pursue other interests.  That way your band still goes on the tour, you get the experience of touring with a larger band (and possibly networking and meeting new contacts and connections that could benefit your own career), and your bandmates are not left without a guitarist.  Your other option is quitting now and damaging your relationship with your current band, them not going on tour, and you looking like a complete ass-hole to everyone who hears the story."
434,"You are allowed to resent your father for this.

He has failed you and it sounds like in some way he enabled your abuse.

Do not be silent. Scream from the hilltops. Cut him out of your life if he won't obey your boundaries. 

You are allowed to be angry, sad, depressed, resentful, *any emotion* you feel here is legitimate. I am so sorry he is not accepting the truth.

You can say ""You want to talk about the man who *abused* me? I'm leaving"" and walk out. You are allowed to say ""If you keep in contact with the man who *abused me as a child*, you will lose me."" You can draw that boundary. You can draw any boundary you want, and I sincerely hope you do, and stand up to that boundary. If he refuses, be prepared to walk away. You deserve a better father than you have been given and I am sorry.


You are not at fault in this at all and your feelings are legitimate and demand respect."
435,"He's definitely never been aggressive, he's a big teddy bear usually. 

However he used to be a very insecure person but I haven't noticed this in him in a long time. He is usually a jealous guy - he used to be very jealous of my male friends when we started dating (I no longer have those friends for one reason or another) so I can't think of anything incriminating he could have found. We have an open technology policy and it's fine with me. If he needs to make a call from my phone he can and that kind of thing.

You're totally right. I am actually pretty scared to see him as it sinks in what has happened.. My mom has offered to come and wait in the background if I meet up with him and you're right, I'm not even sure we can fix this or come back for it. "
436,"I'd suggest that you and your boyfriend sit down and make a plan for yourselves. You need to plan out where you'll live, how you'll support yourself and your child, how you'll prepare for the child, how you'll want to raise it, and what part your respective families will play in the child's and your lives.

You are young, so you'll probably need support. That does not mean that anyone can make decisions for you, however. But you'll need to be open with your boyfriend about these family dynamics, because that's part of being in a functioning adult relationship. Telling his parents might also be a good idea, because your complicated family situation probably means that you'll need more support from the paternal grandparents of your child. "
437,"When my bf and i first got together he told me he had slept with around 8 girls. I didn’t care and about a year later he told me that he lied and it had only been one girl. He apologized for lying about something so unimportant and I honestly still didn’t care because it was such a trivial lie and our relationship had been a very healthy, honest one. You’ll be fine OP!"
438,"Which implies he thinks your ex was just a normal, non abusive ex and that he doesnt believe the trauma you have spoken to him about and think you're exaggerating or lying. GTFO of this relationship now. You do not have the time or energy to deal with someone who is gonna invalidate and gaslight you. "
439,"This post makes it sound like your wife's just being entitled. But you mention in your comments that she has basically no adult work experience and has never worked in your country, because you told her she would never need to. That kind of background really limits her options to only the most basic and possibly gruelling jobs. 

Of course, it would be nice if she was at least willing to try for them. But I can see how frustrated and resentful she might feel that you've switched your position on your marriage roles, and you now expect her to be a working woman after 20 years of being a SAHM. I don't think you realise just how tough that can be. Even women who had big careers before becoming an SAHM struggle to re-enter the workforce. An older woman with no experience is going to *really* struggle. 

If you're still open to working on your marriage, couples counselling would be ideal. It sounds like neither of you view each other as real, equal partners. You've both become each other's means to an end (you as a financial provider and she as the child carer), so you'll need to rebuild that sense of respect and partnership. If your finances are so constrained, try downsizing where you can while also helping your wife more with how/what/where she should be looking for work. 

You may also have to accept that she can't/won't find a job, because she has neither the qualifications or the desire to do so. Maybe that's when you can begin considering divorce. "
440,"I can see that when I said that she probably thought I was throwing shade, but I genuinely meant if they both have such specific requirements then it’s unrealistic to expect another person to be able to perfectly fit that, and actually seeking out a sex worker would be the most ethical option (sex work is legal in my country btw) "
441,"She definitely has a drinking problem, just not one that causes her to drink all the time. "
442,"This is not a phase and it will most definitely get worse after you get married.  She's a selfish, bratty  gold-digger who cares more about how SHE appears to the world than the happiness of your actual MARRIAGE."
443,Or he gets off on people’s uncomfortable reaction to him talking about his sex life. 
444,"I can sympathize with you completely . I made the decision to remove myself from a super religious family (pentecostal ) and my family didn’t talk to me for 4 years . It got better and now my family accepts me for who I am and respects my choices.. I can’t say that it will or won’t get better for you in terms of your family coming around . But i promise you that you will grow in ways you never thought . It’s going to be tough for a little bit , but the rewards of being your own person and the happiness that comes from those choices far outweigh the sadness you’ll have for your family . Just hold your head up high and live your life for you . Hope this helps . "

446,This. I don't think it would be out of place for you to confide in a good friend or two in the department so you at least have one or two people you can lean on and roll your eyes with at these events. And if they happen to let that information trickle out more widely...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
447,"&gt;but ' You are not allowed to go without me'.
I understand that asking him to miss the wedding is a big ask. 


What. The. Fuck?! 


The  issue here is not asking him to miss the wedding, it’s the fact he can’t parent and he thinks he can control you. You’re a grownup, he doesn’t get to say what you’re “allowed” to do. 


Yes, it’s totally reasonable you want to go alone. Can anyone in his family watch the kids? If so, leave the kids with them, leave hubs home, go to wedding. Come back and consider leaving this guy. "
448,If thinks this is an inconvenience for childcare he is in for a big surprise. There will be plenty of missed opportunities with childcare and school and yes he will be inconvenienced again. 
449,Your girlfriend has two boyfriends. Are you okay with sharing your girl with another guy? Because that's what's happening.

453,"&gt;she still had feelings for me as well, and was afraid of me moving on because just incase her and (lets call him F) F broke up I wouldn't be there anymore.

She was keeping you on a string as her backup plan. You were/are Plan B; don't be Plan B."
454,"I'd just ask him. 

""Where do you think I could have gotten an STI from in the last 3 months?"""
455,"Something just isn't quite right with this. It's her defensiveness that is tipping me off and it may be a sign that shes trying to gaslight you. It may not have crossed the line yet but her drunken behavior reveals her true intentions. 

Edited to say the other big tip off is spending 6 hours at his house. Most mature married adults stay out of their friends marriages."
456,"My take? Your gf isn’t stupid and was well aware he didn’t like her at first. You can say he sought to protect you, but it was possessive behavior and she was likely well aware he wasn’t warm to her. And maybe he makes an effort now, but how genuine does that seem to her?

Add to this his unfortunate stance on abortion and it’s possible she sees him as a man who doesn’t really like women. Is that a wild accusation? Yeah. Is it totally unfounded? *Almost*. 

And she probably doesn’t have the words to express this clearly so she defaults to his problematic beliefs and the religion he ties them to. Not acceptable. 

But when she makes accusations about his beliefs, you simply defend him. That’s not what he thinks, that’s not what he meant, you’re wrong. Her feelings and concerns aren’t addressed so she pushes harder. Have you simply been reactive, or have you asked her more questions? “Besides the opinions on healthcare is there anything else that you find disrespectful or unacceptable in my friend?” 

To me it sounds like she was aware of the power he had in your life and it also sounds like she knows he didn’t like her but things moved along fine and so it was never addressed. 

But she has zero entitlement to go forward with an ultimatum here. He may have appalling opinions but unless she is directly disrespected by him, she has to tolerate the friendship. 

This isn’t great advice I know; basically talk to her. But I’m sensing a serious lack of awareness from you, and I think you have assumed he made her feel welcome when that may not have been the case. First impressions die hard. I think she is making a poor choice by citing his religion as the issue because she doesn’t want to simply say “he makes me feel like he doesn’t like me as a woman; calls me a gold digger and doesn’t believe in women’s rights”. Again those things may not be true but that’s how she feels. Because as you say, she always finds something to dislike about him. I don’t think he’s so kind and warm to her as you believe him to be. 

Her feelings are valid, her actions are not."
457,"&gt; My sister is desperate for a child with no health issues, who she says ""would actually love her"".

Sure sounds like he's grooming her, with his ""self confidence issues"" and her problems to create some kind of bond.


How did he even get her Snapchat in the first place?

All of this is so weird."
460,"I think you should tell him, because:

1) regardless of whether or not he is into you, I don’t think you will scare him away - y’all have already done more than any “friends” do. Worst case he says he’s flattered but he doesn’t feel that way - in that case it’s up to you to decide how you want to carry on. Either you can still be friends or decide it hurts too much.

2) peace of mind is a real thing

3) maybe he hasn’t said anything because he knows he’s not your “typical” guy. Maybe he’s just as scared?

IMHO, you’ll regret not telling him, once y’all move on in life. Ultimately it’s up to you, though. You’re taking the risk - no risk no reward, though, no?"

464,Please listen to all of these comments. . Seriously your lucky you're seeing this side of her now rather than after marriage.
465,"As someone who's currently dealing with loud apartment neighbors, no offense to you, but fuck Jim.  It's super disrespectful to decide that it's fine to make noise because it's ""only"" X weeks out of the month or whatever (especially because...a few weeks each month is, like, most of those months).  Your neighbors don't give a shit about Jim's music, they just want to be able to hear their own TVs and talk to each other at a reasonable volume and sleep at night.  God, I hate this.  If your neighbors were writing in for advice I'd tell them to record every time Jim plays the drums and try to get him evicted.

I don't think you really have room to tell Jim he can't practice drums because he couldn't afford them - that ship has sailed.  I think you can totally say, though, ""Jim, people have already complained about the noise from you practicing drums.  I don't want anyone calling the police on us or talking to management.  I don't want to get evicted or have management decline to extend our lease.  You need to find somewhere else to practice music."" If he won't do that, I at least wouldn't live with him.

EDIT: never mind re: the cost - I just fully absorbed that Jim made this purchase with shared funds.  That's *definitely* something you can talk about, as in, ""You spent both our money on these drums that we couldn't afford and now you play them constantly, annoy our neighbors, and neglect your chores, and that's not cool or fair.  You need to pay back the money you used for the drums and find somewhere else to play them."" Then, if he doesn't cool it on the drums, you break up with him because he's a jerk who cares more about playing the drums for 10-13 hrs a day than he does about your neighbors' desire to hear themselves think and your desire to do work and live in your home without fear of getting evicted."
466,"Call her bluff. Send her back a screenshot of the DM with ""if you do, I'll send THIS to our extended family."""
467,"Ouch. Been there. My father in law said similar stuff to me.

We had it out. Pretty big time. I stayed fairly calm and respectful as long as he didn't call her names.

When we got engaged, he asked me to convert, offered me a free house, I said no to both. He begged and pleaded, even if ""in name only."" I didn't.

The weird thing is, their other daughter married a non-muslim, and he converted for them. They treat him like shit.

They treat me very respectfully, and same with my wife. They know they can't pull shit like this for long or we'll be out. And we live a good life.

I'm hoping the same happens to you. Stick to your guns. Remember that you get what you tolerate. Their power over you is really only your belief that they have power over you. Once that belief is changed, the power goes away. 

I won't say any lingering guilt or pain won't continue - my wife goes through it occasionally, even a couple decades later.

But when we do see our in-laws, they are fairly respectful - more respectful than with their other kids and their spouses.

Instead of approaching her openly, you sent an inebriated message accusing her (rightfully or not) of holding a grudge and threatening to talk to her superiors before even getting a response from her.

So, he rapes her. She consoles him. Now, he denies he raped her. This would have me in a padded room if I were OP. (NOT poking fun at mental illness. That level of gaslighting would literally make me mentally break.) "
474,"Yeah. This is SUPER school-by-school. I know most schools lean towards no, but I work at a very liberal school and a good majority of teachers have at least a couple of students’ numbers, IG, whatever. (Personally I have a no students on social media until they graduate rule, and I’m considered an outlier.)

Like I said though, it depends on the school. "
475,"Hell, that could be the entire reason they want the baby in the first place, since there is no SANE reason a person in that situation would want to take on a baby"
476,"Consider this a different way:


He knows that these things can be taken badly. He knows because that's what has happened in the past. He knows that saying these things cause you pain. He knows all those things from *direct experience*.


He keeps doing it anyway.


&gt;He doesn't mean it offensively.


When someone knowingly says something that will cause another person pain, they mean it offensively. Whether or not it's meant as an insult is not relevant in that context; it causes pain, and they did it anyways. 


Best advice I can give is to not tolerate people who are jerks in your life. "
477,"&gt; Neither Gabe nor Gabe's wife responded to my calls or messages either. 

Hard to pick up the phone when you're naked in bed having a threesome ... 

... only slightly kidding. Seriously, what are the chances that _three_ young adults in this day and age do not have their phones near them for 6+ hours unless they are up to something?

&gt; The next morning she was so distraught. She said she was so upset I wasn't in bed with her that she barely slept, and that she was so sorry for making me worry. 

Guilt or she's a good actress. 

&gt; despite the fact that we were both still upset and things were rocky, she left to go to the spin class with Gabe because ""they had plans and it was too late to cancel"".

WTF?!? She's in the middle of a very heated argument with her husband over a relationship-ending issue and she's just ghosted him for an entire night, but spin class with Gabe takes priority?!?! Something not Kosher is going on here. For sure. 

&gt; my wife makes a joke that she and Gabe's wife might go make out a bit on the dance floor.

Yeah, a ""joke"". 

&gt;  Gabe asked me if I was alright with that (he's a nice guy, which makes it hard to demonize him)

We're half way to a key party at this point ... 

&gt; I took the opportunity to excuse myself and get some air. No kissing ended up occurring

How do you know that no kissing occurred? You weren't there. This sounds like Gabe, his wife, and your wife are seeing what _your_ boundaries are like for swinging or at least an open relationship. "
478,"You got kidnapped and imprisoned for 4 years and your dad thinks that's funny?  That you're in the wrong somehow?  What the actual fuck.  You need to get away from these people, like yesterday."
479,"This. OP, think about it this way: would you tolerate anyone else pestering you for sex even once? "
480,Because getting off is more important to him than her suffering. Blegh.
481,She ruined her own life by threatening to kill you. You did exactly what you needed to do to protect yourself and now she can get the help she needs.
482,I think the reason the family is pressuring you to come is they are afraid to deal with June's mood/rage if you don't.
483,"&gt;  I have asked him straight up about whether he sees us having a future together and he hasn't said anything at all.

Don't you understand that his silence was his answer? You are totally wasting your time. 30 year old you is looking back in time right now and screaming at you to wake up."
484,"Each kids does not need a ""cat buddy"" The pets belong to the family. Your family has 2 cats. Your wife is being unreasonable  to try to force more cats on you since you have expressed your desire for no more. Unless both people agree, the answer should be no -- whether it's sex or cats.

Stop going to shelters. Stop letting her toy with the idea of more cats. Stand firm on this. You have given in multiple times. Until the kids are old enough to take care of the cats and the expenses, you get the final say-so."
485,"Someone who leaves you at his parents' house while he goes out with his friends doesn't get to complain that you went out to lunch with his dad. What were you supposed to do, just wait around until he came back?"
486,"My father always told me: ""If you want to *be* enthusiastic, *act* enthusiastic.""

The mind and the body have a feedback loop where if you act a certain way it can actually affect how you are feeling.  

I know you say you are a bad actor, but it's not about the quality of the acting, it's about the fact that you are putting in the effort to *try*.  That will accomplish two things: 1) it will facilitate the biological feedback and potentially help you to *feel* the enthusiasm that you are showing, and 2) it will show your fiance that you are trying.

Becoming is being.  If you can work on *becoming* enthusiastic, by doing the things that an enthusiastic bride would be doing right before her wedding, you will find yourself *being* more enthusiastic."
487,"It probably isn't out of character at all. 

My cousin was with her boyfriend for 6 years, and he waited a few months after they married to beat her for the first time. And it was an extreme beating the first time with no hint of violence beforehand. This is VERY common for abusive men. They are in control of their angry actions and they often only show them when their victim is ""locked in"" through marriage or kids. 

Think about even the most extreme possibility: some tech genius has doctored a video of you cheating on him and showed it to your husband recently. Even in that fake outlandish scenario his actions would not be excused at all. There is no resonable explanation to treat you like that. 

I mean I guess he could have a brain tumor but if not, the ONLY answer is that he is abusive and has been hiding it this whole time. I am sorry. "
488,Did you post this before? I swear I read this exact same post a month or two ago?
489,"Then ask your boyfriend to stand up for your relationship. ""Please stop calling me your work husband, it makes me uncomfortable."" is literally all he has to say. And if she says it again ""didn't I say that made me uncomfortable? why aren't you respecting what I told you?"""
490,"I've seen the same thing.  My Aunts have been together forever.  They held a marriage ceremony.  Some of the family came ""late"".  They started on time.  Everyone knew what they were doing..."
491,"I’m unmarried, but I grew up in the household of a mom with a degenerative neurological illness—slow acting but slowly destroyed her immune system and ability to move, care for herself, be independent. 

My dad stayed. 
I’m not entirely sure why, and it definitely put a lot of strain on the family. 

As the daughter of a mom with chronic illness I only have this advice as to how I wish my mom acted with us. 

I understand that as difficult as my/your husband’s situation is, you have the shorter end of the stick, but in my experience, people suffering from chronic illness have a shorter fuse and because you have feelings of guilt, you tend to justify nasty, short tempered behavior using your illness. In my moms case it also extended to invalidating how I felt. I knew it was because she was frustrated at being dependent on her husband and children and felt largely powerless. She assumed we resented her and responded to this perceived resentment defensively rather than receptively. 

I’d suggest taking time to review your actions and assess how communicative and honest you’ve been. Your husband loves you. He said he hasn’t left you because you’re sick, consider that many people would have. I don’t say this to be cruel, but illness sucks for everyone impacted. Your husband is special. Your guilt does nothing for him. It doesn’t improve the situation, it doesn’t alleviate his stress or your own, so ditch it. It’s annoying frankly. 

I would much rather hear how grateful someone is for me putting in effort helping them out than hearing they feel bad they can’t be helping more. One makes me feel appreciated, another reminds me of what I’m missing out on (I’m not sure if that makes sense). 

Figure out if you want to make this work, and if you decide you want it to, stop victimizing yourself. I’m sorry you’re sick, you can’t do anything beyond what you’ve done. But your assertion that you’ve been stolen away from yourself by your illness is simply untrue. You have real limitations, but you can adapt. It’s a matter of mindset and setting realistic expectations. If you want your relationship to work and you know you only have a few good hours during the day where you aren’t overwhelmed by fatigue, spend them doing something meaningful and considerate for your husband. Take time to devote to a hobby. You aren’t your illness. Take ownership and responsibility over your happiness. Illness happens, victimhood is a choice. 

I don’t mean to sound harsh, and I do genuinely empathize with you more than you could ever know. I myself have been suffering with a rather difficult situation that caused me to feel as though my happiness was stolen from me. I realized this was me being bitter and that I couldn’t give a shitty situation the power to ruin more than it needed to. I’m truly sorry to hear your health is doing so poorly. I hope you have relief soon. 

I can’t tell you what to do, but I believe you deserve love and support especially during this difficult time. I just think you need to find yourself again and remember that even sick you’re able to give love and support too. 

(Edited so that paragraphs were added for reading ease)"
492,"&gt; he said our marriage made him fat and depressed 

Also, major a-hole that is blaming her and their marriage for his own issues. Telling her she needs to be a better wife even though he's been a lying scumbag for the past decade. "
493,"Your brother is in a strong denial right now. He is avoiding you because when he sees you, it makes the situation real to him. 

When you are in a calmer state of mind, try talking to him. Try not to make accusatory statements such as ""You make me feel like I don't matter anymore"" or ""You never ask about me"". Instead say things like ""I love it when you check up on me, I miss our chats"". ""Your stength and sense of humor really cheer me up"". Be prepared to talk about your cancer. Discuss treatments, etc. Try not to lean into the ""what ifs"". I am not saying never to open up emotionally but at this time, just keep things matter-of-fact and positive.

I am so sorry you are going through this. I can guarantee your brother loves you but he is just as terrified as you are. Try not to be angry, you two will need each other in the coming months.

Wishing you peace and healing."
494,Yeah this happened in my friends marriage. He said he felt weird about being sexual with her as he was the mother of his kids now. Pretty liberal hippie guy too. He was surprised by his own reaction.
495,"YES. When I was in high school a group of guys did a similar thing but someone reported it and the Vice Principle got to the bottom of who made it. It never happened again. 

I get that is not the ""cool"" thing to do, but it is the right thing. This is bullying and objectification. These boys need to learn there is a lot more to women than their looks. Which, btw, are so subjective. Everyone's version of pretty is different, and that may help your sister find some solace. 

EDIT to add: does your school have a guidance counselor? They would be the perfect person to talk to about this. They could help you work out your own feelings, make sure your sister is okay, and give these dumb boys the help they clearly need. "
496,"Not trying to be rude, but why do people in your family still accept these ""gifts""? They can't force someone to take a piece of land or a property, right?"
497,"Check with your lawyer, but custody modification attempts usually have to be filed in the court of the county where the child is resident, so if you move before he gets the money together to file, he has to file in your new court, which involves travel or at the very least getting a lawyer in your new town, and I bet that would be an additional bar considering it sounds like he's broke."
498,If he can’t pick you up a puffer for your health because he is hanging out with band mates he doesn’t love you. He thinks he does but he doesn’t. 
499,"&gt; Previously Jim would tidy up after himself but not contribute to any cleaning (laundry, dishes, vacuuming, etc.). This was fine.

This was fine? Really? I'd raise your standards.

Start by getting rid of this guy. He is selfish, lazy, and disrespectful. He doesn't care about you, your dogs, or your neighbors. This isn't about the drums, that's just how his selfishness happens to be manifesting. You can see how happy this makes him - what about your happiness? He doesn't seem to have any interest in fostering that. Respect yourself, because he is not going to."
500,"You were born with a golden ticket. It's not your fault, but it would be naive to not acknowledge that you had an extreme advantage over most everyone else. 

From the sound of it, yes, a lot of your success seems like it's due to nepotism. However, you sound intelligent and like a hard worker, so that's a plus.

On a real note though, your big dilemma in life is picking one extremely well paying job where you're at from another one in London. Rough stuff. You live a fantasy life, with presumably multimillionaire family members, so even if you fail miserably at a new job you will be set for life. This will sound harsh, but most people are worried about their bills or their car breaking down, and they don't give a shit if you feel bad about your position in life not being earned through merit, or you having to pick between investment jobs."
501,"Dude, your girlfriend sucks, plain and simple. She has no understanding of the world and is obsessed with status symbols. You should get out now. 

You job sounds awesome too. Thats amazing that you got an apprenticeship in such a competitive field! You need to be proud of this! That is a huge accomplishment that many people will be very impressed with. In my opinion as an archaeologist whose had to deal with too damn many lawyers over land rights, studying to be a chef sounds a lot more interesting than being a lawyer anyways. "
502,"He didn't buy it for you though, so him guilt tripping you now seem disingenuous. It sounds like he was tired of investing in it and was hoping to see you fix it up for him or didn't consider the realities of the house since he has spent years building up a fantasy around it. 

What was his original plan for this building and what has he been doing there for years if it's in such bad condition? If he wants to give you a gift, ask him to sell it and give you the proceeds or something. I don't think you should really try and appease him here by taking this on if you don't think it's going to be a good investment, especially if you can't even live there as is.  "
503,"Yeah, OP think about if your partner had said ""I'm a lesbian, I'm not attracted to men"". An issue of incompatibility is just there, and there's no moral anything to it."

508,"So don't get me wrong - personally, I agree with you 100% that vacation time should be prioritized for family trips (or staycations). 
 However, your husband clearly disagrees.  He thinks that vacation time should be primarily for personal use, however that individual sees fit.  I personally disagree with him, but I can't honestly say that I'm objectively right and he's objectively wrong.

I *can* say that he's objectively wrong to not be communicating his plans and expectations to you clearly and well in advance, so that you can plan accordingly.

So with that in mind, I think you need to find a compromise.  How much vacation time does he get per year?  Can he reserve a week for a family vacation and still have enough left over for his ""boys weekend"" plus a handful of recharge days?

It might help everybody if you planned your family vacations well in advance, too (your post suggests that your own vacation time occurs last minute as well), so to him it's not just some nebulous, uncertain thing, like ""oh well maybe we'll take a family trip later this year, but maybe we won't, so I might as well take my vacation now"".

You say you've had multiple fights about this before.  What is his justification for continuing to blow you off and just use his vacations whenever he wants, and then not be able to do anything with the whole family?  Does he just not care about family vacations at all, or what?

EDIT: Your current pregnancy and upcoming childbirth are both big, no-compromise-or-discussion-needed exceptions to everything I said above.  He should absolutely, positively, 100% no questions asked be saving up all of his PTO to help you and your family during your recovery.  It reflects very poorly on him that you even need to tell him that."
509,"&gt; I am unsure how to proceed without hurting my boyfriend and his family’s feelings. They are really looking forward to meet me. 

And I'm sure you were really looking forward to spending Christmas *not* in the presence of someone who has a history of child abuse. 

You're allowed to feel uncomfortable about this. ""Didn't molest children"" is NOT an unreasonably high bar to set for people you stay with! And your boyfriend should not be insisting you stay overnight in the house with people you haven't met before or feel uncomfortable with, ESPECIALLY when one of them has a history of abuse. 

""Sorry, I don't feel comfortable staying overnight with him. Can we stay at an Airbnb?"" Is not overdramatic. It's not unreasonable. It's not ruining Christmas. The family are allowed to forgive him if that's what they have chosen to do. They have no right to expect you to do the same. "
510,"Unless there’s something she’s not telling you about the real reason she wants to quit, this should be a pretty big red flag about her maturity and judgement. Her whole mission right now should be building a portfolio of work in order to give her a chance to succeed in a competitive field. That’s not going to happen as a minimum wage grocery bagger or waitress or errand runner. Or whatever else she could do. I’d at least ask for a professional departure, since it’s your friend and you opened the door for her. On a larger level, maybe she doesn’t want to be a designer and she doesn’t know how to admit that. "

This is some highschool level drama, they kissed on purpose and people saw so they came to you with some weak story that you bought.

The whole thing sounds very exhausting, your 23 I would move on to a more mature relationship. You want a 21 year old to act older, when he would rather hang with a 19yr old."
517,This this this. OP- This isn’t about him picking a roommate. This is about him not standing up for you and allowing this behavior to continue for months. This is about you making a reasonable request and him ignoring your feelings and telling you to get over it. What if 5 years in the future you have a kid together and you don’t want some creepy hyper-sexual dude around the kid- will he tell you to “get over it”? This is about him not caring about you feeling safe. What other ways does he not care about your feelings or show his selfish side?

521,"I'm in a similar situation and I try to keep in mind -

1) Dont idolize people who break your heart.

2) comparison is the thief of joy and is mostly to be avoided.

If you get too attached to someone, you have to pull back.  It's not fair to have the expectation that someone will return the feelings.

He doesn't treat you like his GF, because you're not. He's just telling you that to keep the booty call situation intact. "

Your wife shouldn’t stir up trouble and cause drama.  She should have taken the 4 year old to the park or somewhere during the party

Also if the child is so badly behaved the focus should be on addressing that before problems escalate.  That should be a focus.  

Let the older kid  have fun.  "

You, your 16 year-old sibling, and your parents can do without, if necessary.  Ask for help with the kids.

You will be okay, and better for having gotten out of this relationship when you did. "
531,"""You got a letter for child support in the mail. What is this? Please be honest."" 

I mean, yeah, more than likely he has a child...but it's worth asking him vs. accusing him on the crazy slim chance that this is a mix up. Women who have never give birth have had paternity suits and child support filed against them before due to mix ups in the system."
532,"There's a subreddit, I think it's r/mypartneristrans. It's (obviously) for people with trans partners; from what I gather, most have stayed, but there is a minority who haven't worked it out. Maybe if you posted there you could get some insight from people who are/have been in your situation.

Regardless, his gender identity is valid--and so is your sexuality. Neither of you should feel selfish for wanting to take your life in another direction. Compromise is great, but sometimes compromises on fundamentally important issues can lead to resentment in the end, and I think when a relationship ends with resentment the end result is uglier than if there had been a mutual split to begin with.

I think you should definitely continue to talk to your partner, and perhaps get feedback from people in your situation (as well as trans people--there's a subreddit, r/asktransgender). Even if you do not stay together, I think you should try to remain in his life to support him. From what I understand, transition is often spiritually invigorating, but at the same time potentially emotionally draining, and he will need people in his life to provide support and love.

Hope everything works out for you both."
533,"He's 34, he's not going to change. He didn't start dating a 17 year old because he wanted an equal who will challenge him, or have expectations of him, and now that you're older and doing that he doesn't like it. It's likely his abuse will escalate, he doesn't appear to see major problems, he blames you for his actions, and he's being increasingly controlling (spy cameras, immediate threats of divorce, escalation to physical contact etc). All the therapy in the world isn't going to do anything if he isn't trying and isn't genuinely committed to it - you can force him to turn up, but it's not magic, he has to put in the effort and want to change.


You're miserable and fantasizing about leaving, he doesn't care and doesn't really want to fix it if it involves effort or him having to do anything, and it's going to increasingly impact on your kids - there was a post here last weekish about someone who cut their mother out of their life because they blamed her for keeping them in the abusive household they grew up in. Do you want that to be your future?

534,"Unless it’s underwear or like a themed sex toy, I don’t see how memorabilia from a childen’s Movie could be inappropriate. "
535,"  He gave me full custody when she was two years old. In our conversation last night he said he didn’t. He doesn’t even remember doing it. But I have the custody paperwork, and I do in fact have full custody. So I can technically take her. However, it is in the back of my mind he will try to serve me again. 

But the dude doesn’t even have a regular job, and lives in income based housing with his girlfriend and her six kids. So it seems slightly unlikely he would even do that. "
536,"I really feel for you - this sucks, and it seems like you found out after you were already heavily invested in the relationship.  Ask yourself how important this issue is to you.  He says he wants to keep your future children away from gay people (which is virtually impossible anyway).   But what if you had a child who was gay?  How would your boyfriend feel then?  Would he disown your child?  Would he expect **you** to disown your child, too? 

This is a pretty huge fundamental difference to have with someone.  And although you're both directly ""untouched"" by the issue (since neither of you seem to have any gay family members), it's a very distinct possibility that one day, you will have to deal with it in real life.  Is he ok with you hanging out with your gay coworkers and friends?  Is this point of view one that he isn't shy about sharing with other people?  How would you feel if you had to explain to your gay friends that your husband/boyfriend thinks their sexuality is ""bullshit?""

He is a bigot.  If you're ok marrying a bigot, then stay in the relationship.  If you're not, then end things now and find someone whose views are more compatible with your own.  I'm trying my hardest to keep my personal views on the matter to myself, but I have to say that this type of ignorance really gets to me, and judging by your post, it seems like it's important enough that it gets to you too.

Sorry you're going through this. xo"

538,"Hey, I'm also a woman with PTSD from a past abusive relationship. My boyfriend, who I met when we were 20, has never made a single comment like the one your boyfriend made. He was clumsy and didn't really know how to support me or talk to me about it, but he never dismissed me or made cruel jokes. He was patient, kind, thoughtful, and really committed to learning how to be there for me in whatever way I asked. And he was barely 20. It's just his personality. I believe that his support is the reason I stopped having panic attacks four years ago. 

We have a normal relationship, he's certainly not my therapist, but he hugs me when he can tell I need a hug or leaves me alone when I need time by myself. Having someone who cares enough to develop those kinds of instincts with you is just magical. I want that for you. I want you to have a boyfriend who knows exactly how to comfort you after a nightmare and distract you from your worries. If this guy is it, you know it already. Maybe he just made a mistake and he's sorry. I have to say that I believe your instincts shouldn't be ignored. I'm not jumping to ""break up now!"" but I know that feeling of trust is so precious to me and I would be upset to lose it the way you have. "

I think it's time to put a bunch of distance between you and them. Including the ""friend"" who thinks it's ok to act this way. 

Join groups, find places to volunteer and meet new people. Move. Whatever it takes to make a new life for yourself. You don't deserve this. 

In fact, I might very much leave her high and dry because of these shenanigans.

Either way this is an issue with your partner. He needs to stand up for what you want or you need to wait two years and try not to stress out about it. Either of these options are rational and something that could be done. Is M on the same page as you? What does M want in the way of his wedding? "
545,"They are both turning blame on YOU because they are both too afraid to be angry at each other, because they both think their relationship is fragile.  She is incapable of asserting herself and he is incapable of letting her grow up.  You are WAY too young to commit to this girl in the state she is in.  She isn't mature enough for a real relationship."
546,"Your older cat was extremely unhappy when the kitten was brought home and that was when he still had his brother. The kitten clearly stressed him out.

Cats need time to grieve, as well. His world has suddenly changed. His lifelong partner is gone. Adding another cat to the mix so suddenly is actually pretty cruel. 

There is also zero guarantee the kitten-now-younger-cat will like this new cat. You could get a three-way kitty warfare going.

First steps: teach your 9-year-old to do cat chores and do it right. Let things settle for a year. Then discuss the possibility of a third cat if the chores are to your satisfaction (a year is long enough to teach it and see if it actually is consistent).

Maybe approach your wife from the angle of how your older brother cat reacted last time and that there’s no guarantee one or both of your cats won’t hate the guts out of this new cat... especially when they’re still adjusting to the sudden loss. And that you need to see a year’s proof of consistent and correct chore-keeping on cat care by your wife and your oldest kid.
"
547,"Uhm, you should include this in the original post. I was considering that maybe you were in a nearby state, and it might just be for a couple days.

548,"&gt;How do I move forward and help her to trust me? How to I fix our marriage?

Are you really this clueless?  She told you what the path forward is.  It's this:

&gt;She told me I had to get my act together, come clean to this girl and then cut contact, and allow my wife to go through my phone whenever she wants if I even want a chance of things working out.

Do whatever she asks, and expect it to take a long, long time.  You prove it to her with your actions.  Showing her that she is your priority. 
"
549,"Whoo boy, that is too much guilt. I think I can help, though.

I work end user technical support. At least once a day, it involves me giving a customer an extra copy of their service order while I'm still running virus removals on their computers because they got scammed. They get a call from ""Windows"" telling them that their computer is sending out viruses and that they're not licensed properly. They then sell the customer a $700-$1500 package that ""covers them for life.""

Most of the customers who made it to me realised they'd been had AFTER they paid for it. Why? Because until they had the experience for themselves, they didn't realise what a scam looked like. I'd give them an extra service order copy to give to their bank so they could report the fraud and maybe get their money back.

Every. Day. I see this. From people as young as you to people older than your parents.

We are all imperfect, disgusting meat sacks spiraling endlessly through space on a jank-ass rock towards our inevitable demise. You're going to fuck up--we all do. You're going to do, say, and feel some really stupid shit, because that is the nature of our species. Ugh. Humans.

There is no reason to beat yourself up over this. Now you know better, and no one will be able to fool you like this again. Just because you fucked up doesn't make you bad. It just makes you one of several billion of the aforementioned meat sacks. 

But you're learning. You feel responsibility. That's great! But move on. Keep on going forward, and be the best meat sack you can."
550,"I dated this guy several years ago. Trust me, he knows she's flirting and he likes it. He feels validated by the attention and while he might care for you, it's not enough to firmly establish boundaries. Sorry if that's harsh, but if you allow this to continue, I assure you this won't be the last time. These people feed off attention and drama.

See, he'll walk up to the line, look at the line, place his toe *on* the line, but then will balk when you point this out. ""But I didn't cross the line!"" He'll protest, while making you feel crazy/anxious/paranoid/needy. And Erin? Yes, actually you do get to be mad at people who purposefully disrespect your relationship, unless he hasn't told her about you, which is another problem in itself.

&amp;#x200B;

As for what you should do? At 22, there's so much life ahead of you that it seems like a waste of time to spend emotional energy on a guy like Mark, but you say you love him and he gets you, so you should weigh the cost of having to deal with the insecurity around Erin (and there will be more Erins) against the benefit of what he provides. It sounds like you've never been single as an adult, which can cloud your judgment. "
551,I just can't wrap my head around a guy who would eat in front of his own children like this. What a terrible father.

553,"It's not intended to be harsh. What's harsh is her dad's actions. People do not just 'forget' about their children's weddings that they are invited to multiple times. If you do, that's something you're choosing to do. And I think it's important OP understands that her dad isn't just forgetful, he's choosing estrangement. I do think she gets it, and I feel awful that her dad is a POS. "
554,"&gt; He raised his voice and told me I was neglecting my health by not getting tested again

I would ask him what STI he thinks would show up if you two are monogamous and he doesn't have any. This is honestly bizarre and is like asking you to look in a locked drawer only you two have keys to every three months for a gun because you're neglecting your safety if you don't, even though he didn't put a gun in there and neither did you."
555,"What he is doing is super super common with depression.  He is obsessing over something outside of his ""miserable life"" reality and that he is good at.  Luckily he isn't gambling or overspending, etc.  This is something he should talk to his therapist about because it is interfering with his ability to perform in real life.  "
556,"Yeah, I'd give him a week to backpedal on this before blowing up over it. Sounds like the set up for a prank."
557,"This is a good point. And I think if I had put out a not-quite-real version of me, I'd want to know if someone had heard it so I could explain any discrepancies etc."
558,"The fact that he and his therapist feel that ""the timing is suspect"" when you have shown him the physical proof, yea I hate to say it, but you do not need that in your life.  
I hope you get the cancer totally removed and you live a long healthy and happy life."
559,"Look, even if he chooses to be with you you deserve better. He’s clearly not interested in monogamy or transparency in a relationship. You and your children deserve a stable life with more honesty than that man can give you. He has taken advantage of your naivety to string you along for years. Get a lawyer, get child support, and move on without him."

You're 20. You're gonna wanna do things with people.

He's 35. He's taken advantage of your youth and inexperience from the jump. He doesnt even *care* that he hurt you and violated your sense of control over your own body. He doesn't love you. He doesn't care. He just wants to own someone. He *raped* you. You deserve better."
561,"This was well said OP, I was trying to come up with something similar without it being harsh. Everyone has deal breakers"
562,"&gt; I make a decent salary so sometimes it is more out of principal.

You met a woman in another country, married her and brought her to your country, told her she would never have to work again in her life, and 20 years later, are trying to force her to get a job because of the *principle* of it? Is this right?"
563,This is so incredibly inappropriate. I wouldn’t be remotely ok with this friendship. Not to mention it’s ok Snapchat so no record of their conversations. 
564,He called me later that day and I asked him about it and he said he didn't mean anything about it and that 'everyone talks bad about their exes.'
565,"It’s really difficult to know why you thought this was a good idea, it has disaster written all over it."
566,Think of it as a few hundred dollar lesson not to spend that kind of cash that early in a relationship again
567,I would still be really careful if he comes back and tries to talk to you. It's easy to get sucked back into someone's bullshit (I speak from experience.)
568,maybe he is NOT her lobster.
569,"Your dad is abusive too. He lied to cover for your abuser and encouraged and aided the abuse. I know you see him as the good guy, but that’s just because he wasn’t as bad as the youth pastor guy and because you had no better options. Now you are an adult and you can legally live anywhere you want.

Is there any other person you could ask for help at this point? You are literally better off asking strangers for help than living with your dad. And therapy, ASAP.

I am so proud of you for getting yourself out of that awful situation and I wish you had some help. Take care of yourself!"
570,If you’re paying 50% and go to school... you’re not the stay-at-home-partner. Sounds like you guys would benefit from having a conversation. Therapist would be helpful. 
571,"He is NOT a wonderful person.

He raped you.  You are currently dealing with the trauma of that rape.

Wonderful men do not rape people:  that's pretty much the lowest possible requirement for being ""passably okay, maybe?"" as a human being.  See also, ""does not hit people"" and ""is not a Nazi.""

Please get therapy for yourself:  abuse corrodes everything it touches, and it absolutely rewires the brain so that your sense of reality gets seriously warped.

What you feel isn't ""love,"" it's *addiction.*  You ""love"" him like an alcoholic loves booze, like a junkie loves heroin.  You're experiencing trauma bonding, which produces that amazing high you feel when he's super sweet and thoughtful and loving, and you think to yourself, ""Yes!  This is all I've ever wanted!  If I died tonight, I could die happy!""  It is simply not possible for a human being to feel so happy, and it makes everything you've experienced, the rape, the degradation, the humiliations, just fall away.

It's just science.  What you're experiencing is the stress hormones receding and the dopamine rushing in to take its place:  you might as well be shooting up heroin.

Please, please get therapy.  Your local women's shelters should be able to refer you to therapists who specialize in abuse victims.  If money is a problem, go to Captain Awkward and search for ""low cost mental health.""  While you are there, start reading through her voluminous archives on abuse:  she has much wise and compassionate advice.

Also?  Call someone at either thehotline or loveisrespect and have a chat about your situation.  And be sure to reach out to trustworthy friends and family members--you don't have to tell them anything about your sex life, just that you are in an abusive relationship and need support while you find a way to extricate yourself.

572,"That's not stupidity, it's cynical selfishness masked as stupidity. Once you chew them out enough, they'll just find someone else willing to give them the benefit of the doubt "
573,"&gt; I can’t quite place it, but it sounds like something else is happening below the surface, and that the religious differences could be an easy cover for something else? I’m not sure why it comes across that way for me.

I agree with you on this. 

OP, did your girlfriend move in with you after a month of dating? And when Christian told you his doubts about the relationship, did you tell your girlfriend? 

From the information you've given us, it sounds like your girlfriend doesn't like Christian because he questioned the relationship. If y'all moved in together after a month, he was in the right to raise some concern there. "
574,That’s mostly what’s holding me back. Thank you. 
575,"""Ridiculous"" is a super nice way to put it. "
576,"No, you can’t have a healthy relationship with someone who doesn’t trust you. And because she’s making her lack of trust your problem instead of acknowledging that it’s something she needs to work on, there’s nothing fixable here."
577,"&gt; He decided fuck it, he never does anything fun and figured there wouldn't really be consequences so he was going to do it.

Hold up - he “never does anything fun,” and instead of planning something fun with his fiancée, he decided to play hooky with his female coworker like a naughty teenager? 

And he “thought there wouldn’t be consequences” even though he KNOWS that his employer has a practice of writing people up for infractions? And that ditching work without notifying anyone or having a damn good reason is most certainly an infraction? 

Your fiancé is shady *and* stupid. "
578,"Stop paying for him. Stop doing things with him that cost money. Stop driving him places if he won't pay for gas. For instance, if you go to the movies, buy your ticket and yours only. If he gets upset, too bad, that's his problem. You don't have to argue, justify, explain or defend your stance to him. Just ignore him and let him sulk. He's a grown man, he needs to learn to pay his own way. You don't have to let him take advantage of you, which is what he's doing.

I have a feeling if you just stop paying his way and letting him mooch you'll soon find out how much of a friend he actually isn't."

580,"My now ex-boyfriend of 8 years just ended our relationship a few days ago after we made plans to get engaged in a few months. We had lived together for many years. He, too, couldn't put his finger on what was making him feel dissatisfied...but he was so uncertain and couldn't go through with it. I could tell he felt so much guilt and pain, and he declared he still loved me, but something was off and he no longer believed we should be together for the long term.

I feel completely lost, confused, heartbroken, and left wondering what I should have done differently. I can't imagine the extra pain you are feeling in having to deal with canceling your wedding as well. Something that I've been thinking about that maybe will help you, too...so much of our emotional energy was (happily) spent invested in our relationships. Now, we have so much extra emotional energy to give that can be offered to our friends, family, etc. I also find it helpful to reflect on the fact that if our SOs were dissatisfied, there were probably small ways that they made us feel less loved, cherished, and secure than we would have liked. I'm starting to contemplate those minor instances, and tell myself that there is a relationship out there where I will hopefully never feel this way.

I've also found it comforting to think that my ex likely has some emotional turmoil to work through within himself that made it hard for him to communicate and contributed to his uncertainty. I'm trying to have compassion for him and know that it is terribly painful for him as well - even though we cannot help each other through this pain. I hope that he seeks therapy and reaches out to his support system, too. It's hard to let myself feel that love and hope for him, but I think it's better than masking it with anger.

Good luck...it will be a tough road but you will make it &lt;3"
581,It's not bordering on anything. It is sexual assault.
582,"If you compromise your career path for your boyfriend, you'd be accepting 100% of the risk of later relationship breakdown for like 20% of the benefit of relationship continuation. Never ever ever do that. 

If you got married first, and he agreed to pay the difference in your tuition from where you would have gone with the extra money soldiers get from being married and promised to get out of the military when his five years is up so you can pick a place to take the bar and stay, then it'd be closer to 50/50 and might not be a disastrous idea, but at your age and with your conflicting career situation I *really* can't recommend marrying someone you've been dating less than like six years. "
583,"Good for you. GOOD FOR YOU. This is great news!

My ex was a medic in the marines and touted his bedside manor from time to time. But the two times I saw it up close and personal, I doubted everything he ever told me (or realized he was totally delusional). 

Once, I had terrible cramps and couldn't walk to the corner store to get Advil. When I pleaded for a hot water bottle or pills, he finally lobbed a bottle of aspirin at me then turned around and left the room without even bringing me water (any medic will know that aspirin is the wrong tool for that job). The second time I slipped on ice and cut my knee. I sat on the side of the tub while he cleaned my wound and put a bandage over it, admonishing me for how it happened, then slapped my hurt knee ""to get the band-aid to stick"". We broke up not too long after. He was a bad person, and those were the ways it came out, among others.

If you get a pit in your stomach thinking about how your mate will behave when the worst parts of life come up like cancer, job loss, tragedy, etc, move on. Move. On."

How selfish :( sorry, OP. I hope he sees the light if you talk to him about this. That's messed up.

592,"I've heard it said that men tend to plan forwards. ""First I want to get a job, that might take six months. Then I want to spend a few years getting settled in that job, so that's 3 years. Then I want to buy a house (4-5 years from now), then take another year to rebuild savings before we start planning a wedding. So I think I'll be ready to get married in 6-7 years, assuming everything goes to plan. Then we can enjoy being married for a few years before we start planning for kids 10 years from now.""

On the other hand, women tend to plan backwards. ""I want two kids, and I want to have them both before I'm 38. So I should try to have my second child around the age of 36 in case it takes me a while to fall pregnant, and in order to have them well spaced, I should try to have the first around the time I'm 33. I want to be married for at least a year before I fall pregnant, so we should get married around the time I'm 32. If we have a year-long engagement, we should get engaged in a year's time.""

Do you see the problem? 

You can wait for him to get better if you want, but I suspects he has a long list of items he wants to tick off *before* he gets married, and the years he will take to do that will erode the years in which you want to do the things he's putting off.  If you really want a committed marriage and children, you would be far better off with someone who is on the same page as you, not someone who *might* be ready at some hypothetical point in the future.

593,"OP, you’ve been married a few months. Most abusers escalate at commitment milestones like that because they know it is harder for you to leave."
594,"Even if not outright gross/sexual, excessive PDA or even constantly touching/being next to one another comes-across as very exclusive. I think people are more likely to bond when they perceive the other person as opening up/showing vulnerability. You may be getting in the way of that by constantly being near Ella. 

So while I generally agree your friend group needs to do a little work..I also think you should consider toning it down and try acting like individuals. "
595,"Hi OP, im really sorry youre in this spot. Being blamed for something youve never done is one of the worst feelings. Idk if this helps, but maybe hes projecting his own insecurities. Using you as a scapegoat, telling you youre the cheater to bury his own bull."
596,"My ex was incredibly charming, lavished me with compliments, was the best gift-giver ever because he would pick up on little things I said I wanted that I didn't even remember mentioning.

He would also sometimes get blind drunk and scream at me, call me names, and once tried to kick in the bathroom door when I locked myself in to get away from him.

The duality of abusers is precisely what can make them so hard to leave."

/u/Entire_Upstairs It’s because they were having sex. Seriously, I find it very hard to believe all 3 would be unreachable by phone for so long if sex wasn’t in the equation.

Your wife is masterful at gaslighting. It doesn’t matter that Gabe is married — their relationship is inappropriate and stepping outside the bounds of your marriage.

The whole situation you described is so manipulative and disgusting. She prioritizes her relationship with Gabe, over you *her spouse*. Fuck spin class! She needed to fix things with you but she left to be with him. When people show you who they are, believe them!"

It is unfortunate (to say the least) that your father was so abusive to you both when you were young; however her behaviour is her responsibility.

Actions have consequences, even if you regret them later. One of the consequences of her past actions is that your relationships with your family were nuked. You have no obligation to be around people who make you feel bad, just so she can rugsweep and play happy families.

Using manipulative tactics, like tears and crying voicemails to attempt to force your attendance against your clearly stated wishes, suggests that her recovery journey is not yet complete. Do not reward bad behaviour, you're just teaching her that X number of weepy voicemails will get the desired result.

Her feelings are NOT more important than yours. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Live for your future, not her past."
606,"Ex sex worker here (and actually a unicorn to my married couple partners) and honestly you were right to say 'if you are this specific, perhaps a professional is best'. 

Because a professional has the boundaries in place to shut thier shit down if they still impose and the boundaries around compensation to re-work the power dynamic.

And Brie can get bent if she thinks hiring a sex worker is sex negative because that sounds like she has fallen in the misrepresentation of sex positivity that if you do stuff for fun, you're a good wh*re and if you do it for money, then you are a bad wh*re and she's so fucking skewed in her sexual morals that I'd take her and Brad's cold hard cash, wear the outfit and then do them a Powerpoint presentation on boundaries, sex workers' rights, not objectifying sex workers and LGBTQIA people and generally not using kinkiness as an excuse to be an asshole.

Because they just hit every single square of the bingo card on why unicorns want to use that pointy little horn to gore couples with who think they are sexy sex toys rather than people. I had a unicorn tax for people like this when I was a sex worker. I tripled my hourly rate as a starting point and insisted on the venue so they couldn't pull the home territory advantage too.

Good luck finding nicer people in your life than these two boundary stomping gobshites.

Yes!!  You absolutely 100% NEED time to yourself as a parent.

608,"I was at first thinking you should contact her to retract it, but it's better if you write a response piece.  I mean she wrote something about you without your permission and only changing the name.  I bet that if they know the mom's name, they could figure out who you really are etc.  That being said, just write a response about it.

Meetups are great, therapy is great, but expat communities exist for literally this reason. No matter how exciting, it's also a huge change and it's **hard**.

I think you are right, I just don't think it is something that can be fixed and I won't be able to trust him again. "
615,"Okay.

The first thing that strikes me is the *passiveness* of this  novel:  a series of things have happened or are about to happen and you are unable to do a damn thing about any of this.

So, the first question is:   Why do you think you have no agency, no *power* here?

It's an important question to unpack.  Were you not allowed to say ""no"" growing up?  Were you raised to fear disappointing people in any way, shape or form?  Was your family abusive?  A narcissistic parent?  Were you perhaps the Scapegoat?

I ask because all of these problems have simple solutions that you are unable to see:  *why is that?*

* You don't want any more children?  Ever?  Then you get a vasectomy.  You might, however dimly, consider a child in the distant future?  Then you use condoms and spermicide, or forego PiV sex.  

* You don't want to move to Bumfuck, NE and raise chickens?  Then don't move there and don't do that.

* Your wife wants to spend money on trips to Europe?  You control the purse strings.  You say, ""No, that will not work for me, but I would be happy to help you find a job so you can find the money for that.""

Yet another question:  Why do you think any of the obvious solutions are impossible for you?  That your wife will throw a fit?  Why do you fear that?

**Get therapy.**  For YOU ALONE.  Your wife is used to getting her way and she has a Team Her that is encouraging her every step of the way.  She wants what she wants and there is nothing you can say or do that is going to dissuade her:  that is why sitting down and talking to her about finances and budgets isn't going to do any good.  *She doesn't care.*  She will look at the numbers and simply tell you to get a second job (and has already suggested this as a solution, yes?).

You need to get control of your life.  **Get therapy.**  You need to learn that saying ""No!"" is not the end of the world.  And that's the magical thing about having children or moving:  you need two ""yes's"" to make either happen; one ""no"" makes it stop.

If your wife is gungho on a chicken farm in NE, then...let her go.  Don't argue.  Don't give reasons.  (By the by, look up ""JADE.""  This is what you never EVER do).  ""But it will be the best thing ever, living off the land with chickens!""  ""That will not work for me.""  ""But WHYYYYYYYYY?""  ""Because it will not work for me.""  ""Why are you so meeeeeeeaaaaaaannnnn?""  ""I'm sorry you feel that I'm mean.  Still, it will not work for me.""

Since she's used to you being passive and doing what she wants, she will not take this well.  That's okay.  *She's allowed her own feelings.*  Let her rage and pout and cry and whine.  It will pass, *and you will find that the world has not ended just because you stood up for yourself.*

Once again:  **You need personal therapy, and you need it now.**  Start calling around, NOW.  If money and/or availability is a problem, go to Captain Awkward and search for ""low cost mental health.""  And while you are there, start reading through her archives about boundaries and the art of saying ""no.""

You have power in this relationship, you always had.  You need to realize it and use it."
616,"I remember reading comments on an AskReddit thread about the moment you realised you were going to breakup with your partner. One women wrote about how her and her husband were driving in the car with the radio on. A song she liked came on and she said ”oh, I really like this song.” Her husband immediatly turned off the radio. She said that it was the moment she realised she was going to divorce him. He couldn’t even let her be happy about a song, but had to sabotage it for her.

Are you having the same moment?

You were happy about something good happening to you and her reaction was to try and take it away. That’s not a loving or healthy reaction. It also seems from how often she does it and her lack of remorse, that this is who she is. So not just a bad day or a misunderstanding. If she dissaproves of your reason for being happy, even for petty or selfish reasons, then she’ll intentionally make you miserable.

You deserve to be happy!

If your partner don’t agree, then they shouldn’t be your partner any more.

You seem to be already almost ready to breakup.  This could be what you needed to act on what you were already feeling."
617,"There's no magical daycare that is going to be open 365 days per year.

He won't be affected by this, and you already have the week off, so no need to organize alternative daycare.  There must be a deeper issue for him here, unless he's just pulling a stress tantrum of sorts? "

626,You don't need his permission to divorce him. Go to a lawyer and end your marriage. Your husband is abusive.
627,"I dont really have any advice for you other than I sympathize greatly and to tell you that you will survive this.

Because I understand your situation in a very personal way. My ex-husband and I work together at a very prominent employer in our city and he cheated on me with a co-worker. No kids. It went down in a very similar fashion and we were close to the same age as you and your husband (43 &amp; 46). The divorce was quickly finalized. There was tremendous gossip at work. So many times I would enter a room with a group of coworkers and it would go silent. Ugh. It seemed to me like people chose sides. They were the happy golden couple and I was the alone, scorned spouse. I kept my side pretty private and they seemed to like to talk about the gory details. People loved that they were willing to gossip and share.

She seemed to go out of her way to be around me and to try and make me uncomfortable or to get me to cause a scene. I ignored it as if nothing were happening in the moment. It was the hardest damn thing I have ever done in my life.

But I cried so many times out of anger, frustration, and sheer loneliness. My personal life had become my own Hell in my professional life. There was absolutely no escape. I couldn't go home to get away from it and I couldn't go to work to get away from it. They both just wanted me to quit my job so they could have their new life together without having to see evidence of their shitty decisions. I refused to let them ""win"".

I started dating somebody that I liked and now love very much and we are still together 3 years later. We may or may not get married but I'm hopeful. He's a really, really good man.

Funny thing that happened with work is that about 6 months after the divorce people got sick of hearing about the drama from the other two. She got very insecure about the fact that I had not just slunk away in shame and was still around acting as if I had a perfectly great life without him. At about a year after he started to question the stupidity of throwing our life together away and tried to reconnect with me. Nope. 

I hear they are having loads of issues but I really don't know if they are still together or not. I dont really give a flying fuck. They both got passed for promotions and I think their drama contributed greatly to that.

The old cliche is so true. Living well is the best revenge."

If it's going from uncle to parents and then direct to school, I don't see a problem. If he wants to spend the cash, let him spend it. Just remain hyper vigilant and make sure he isn't reaching out to you for any of the catches you are suspicious about. You have zero obligation to him. "
631,"So how far do these traditional views go, exactly? Does she want to be a stay at home wife/mother someday? Does she want you to be the head of household and primary decision maker, while she wants to play a more deferential, supportive role? If so, that's a deeply ingrained value system, and one that isn't likely to change. If that isn't the marriage model you want, you really need to examine if your views on life are similar enough to make this work long term. 

If, however, her only traditional view is that you pay for everything, and beyond that she wants everything to be modern and equal, that's total BS. She just likes to be treated, so she's claiming that as a ""value system"". I'm not really sure the best way to address it. I'd probably say something like ""we're not traditional people, so I don't think 'tradition' in a good enough reason for me to go bankrupt in this relationship alone. I understand that you like to be treated and feel taken care of. What ways can I do that that aren't financial?"""

Talking everyday or briefly throughout the day is not by definition clingy. Multiple missed calls and unreturned messages in a short time period when the receiving party is knowingly unavailable? That's clingy. Where OP lands on that spectrum, only she knows.

To me it sounds like a compatibility issue regarding the level of contact and the frequency of communication a relationship calls for. Rather than acknowledge that incompatibility or work towards a compromise, BF is using words like ""clingy"" and ""unreasonable"" to shame OP into behaving the way he thinks is best.

It's also worth mentioning that when my dad was diagnosed, I was with an alcoholic layabout who didn't get it at all. I'm now with someone who knows all about it, and he proposed to me two months ago - he gets it. He's met my dad, he comes to our support group and he understands what's going to happen. All I can really say relationship wise is that you need to be with someone who gets it; who sees what your family is dealing with and who is 100% prepared to be involved.

Maybe get a doorbell camera (they have models that slide over the door if you're in an apartment so nothing is permanently attached) and just keep your eyes open for being followed or any other weak points where you would be vulnerable.

I'm not saying your parents are going to do something, and I certainly hope they don't, but there's definitely a non-zero change that they will, so better to be prepared for it. There have been stories from around the world of honor killings/beatings/acid attacks/etc. . ."

651,"My exact reaction.

&gt;his subconscious won’t let him be with someone short

So his subconscious has just been taking a little nap for the past 4 years?"
652,"&gt;I've heard people say that you have to choose what you want more kids or your spouse. I feel like that is an unfair way to look at it because I married my wife because I love her and want to have kids with her and that's what she wanted too....I thought.

But she changed her mind, so you have to chose. So if you want kids, they're not going to be with her. Don't try to change her mind or give her an ultimatum because if she says she will have kids to keep you around she WILL resent you and will resent your children. If you find a partner you love that also wants kids you're not really choosing at all - you get the spouse and the children is just won't be this spouse.

This is a really shitty situation. She has every right to change her mind but based on all the ""postponing"" it sounds like she's known for a while and didn't want to tell you. Unfortunately there's no other way around this: you want kids and she doesn't. You need to find a partner that you can have children with."
653,"To add to what the poster above said, you don’t have to tolerate your parents verbally shaming you or berating you. 

You can hang up if they attack you like that again. 

You also need to get comfortable with phrases like “mom and dad I understand that we don’t agree on this but I’m a grow adult. I get to make my own decisions” 

“Living my own life isn’t disrespecting you”

“Stop trying to pressure me into complying if you want to keep having a relationship with me.” 

I really doubt your parents will ignore you forever. But they probably will ignore for for awhile to make you feel excluded in hopes of you complying. "
654,"&gt;I try to tell my husband to let him play with what he wants. He says, ""I don't want him growing up to be a sissy. He needs to play with his trucks and action figures.""

1. He's got some serious gender ideals and masculinity issues that can be harmful to your kid. This needs to be addressed ASAP.

2. This is more for him, but stereotypical manly things can be ridiculously ""sissy"" too. I'm a guy who watches a sport that other guys love, and it involves a lot of big men grabbing each other trying to hold onto a ball, then spanking each other on the sidelines when a good play is made. Also the biggest name in this sport was recorded in a documentary kissing his son on the lips for an uncomfortably long time. Just saying.

&gt;Do you guys think my husband is being ridiculous?

100%. Masculinity as a concept is kinda stupid to me. It equates being masculine with being tough, and it implies that liking typically feminine things makes you inherently less masculine or less strong. It's just a BS rationale to have.

I'll use myself as an example: I'm a dude who grew up on Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls. I can quote practically any iconic Gilmore Girls scene from memory and I can tell you that ""Say Something"" is my favorite Gilmore Girls episode of all time. I also did ten years of martial arts and am pretty damn good with a pistol.

I didn't choose to fight people for fun or learn how to shoot because I wanted to be a manly man. I did it because it seemed fun and I wanted to. Similarly, I chose to watch Veronica Mars and Gilmore Girls because they seemed like (and definitely are) really good shows. Those shows definitely cater to women more than men, but fuck it, good TV is good TV. Watching those shows never me from doing martial arts.

And funny enough I got my personal strength from my mom and not my dad. She was the one who taught me that life will knock you down many times. She's also the one who taught me to always get back up, keep on trying, and never be afraid of getting hit again. It's the basis of my mindset in life. I remember getting my ass completely handed to me in a sparring match and I started crying. She took me aside and simply told me ""If you don't like someone hitting you, get back up and hit them harder. Crying won't stop them from hitting you more.""

She was an immigrant who can speak English but struggles with it in a professional or academic setting. I remember when I was a kid, I saw her staying up til 2AM studying for her dental assistant licensing exam. She had her study book on one side and an English to Vietnamese book on the other. She spent months studying while writing translations in the margins so she can understand what the book was saying.

Fast forward a decade and a half and I decided to switch from programming to security. I signed up for a course + cert I'm wholly unqualified for (PWK/OSCP for all you sec people), put in 80hrs a week studying, and now I know how to do hacking things. I had literally zero security knowledge before starting whereas most people who take this exam have at least a year or two as pentesters. It never phased me once that I was taking on something most people thought was beyond my reach and I never thought twice about simply going for it. That mentality is entirely attributed to my mom who is by far the strongest person I've ever known in my life."
655,"Listen carefully to his words, he's not saying he's bisexual. He's not saying ""you're the only woman who's ever aroused me. It was confusing, I love you, I married you because I'm attracted to you, and love you."" He's saying he's *gay,* and is now asking you to sacrifice romantic love for the rest of your life because you're his best friend. You deserve love. You deserve to be with someone who feels a hormonal response akin to your own when they look into your eyes, or catch your scent. You can also continue to support your life partner, as a *friend*, you can even go to a couples therapist about the best way to consciously uncouple so you may be able to maintain being in each others lives while recovering from the pain of this. But you should never feel as if you have to sacrifice something so fundamental as romantic love because you love someone who can never reciprocate. There's so many sacrifices we make daily without a conscious thought, and when we lose so much daily, just why should we further in debt our lives to a conscious loss? "

660,"Girl, reading your post and comments, I'm gonna say that this is a HARD NO. 

My reasons are:

1) Cheaters cheat. This is probably why he doesn't want a long-distance relationship. He knows he will fuck it up. Trust me, you don't want to marry somebody like that. 

2) You guys aren't headed toward marriage. He's not willing to propose to you so that you can get the actual benefits of being a military spouse, but he wants you to totally uproot your life. He's hedging his bets at your expense. Your parents are absolutely right to be concerned. 

The statement you made that you both wouldn't want a long-term relationship is the most telling part. I'm married and have a baby, and I would be crushed if my husband told me that a long-distance relationship wouldn't work. It's just not the talk of a couple who is ready or willing to make that commitment. And without that, you shouldn't be making any sacrifices

3) I really just get the vibe that you two are incompatible. Your lives are headed in different directions with two careers. His career isn't wrong, it's just not compatible with being a lawyer. Don't let this stand in your way of living out your true potential.

He probably doesn’t want to get married (also a valid thing, just not a particularly compatible thing for your wants) but doesn’t want to lose you so keeps thinking maybe he’ll be ready for it eventually.

671,"I may get downvoted for this but here goes. When you were both young and were getting married you told her that she’d never have to work. She agreed and you got married. Would she have said yes if you said now we’ll both need to work? You don’t know. Maybe her dream was to be a stay at home mom and there’s nothing wrong with that especially since you literally told her she doesn’t need to work. 

You’ve been married TWENTY YEARS. That’s not a small gap in between jobs. There are not many jobs out there that would hire a nearly (or over) 40 year old woman with ZERO work experience. Does she have a college degree? If not that will severely limit an already very small group of places that would hire her. Also can she even do a lot of physically demanding stuff (lifting heavy stuff, cleaning, etc that lower level jobs would require). 

That just sounds so overwhelming for her. And the fact that she’s encouraging your daughter to work shows that she realizes how important it is to not be stuck without the ability to easily be independent. My heart kind of breaks for her. 

She is likely scared and feeling lost. She threatened divorce because she’s likely majorly overwhelmed and feeling hurt that you went back on your word. I’m 100% certain she does not literally want a divorce.

Is it unreasonable to re-evaluate her not working? No. But this is something to be approached as a team - you HELPING her - to figure out what can be done (career counseling, researching options, etc). Just telling her (after 20 years!!) that she needs to work and to get a job is like trying to teach someone to swim by flinging them into the deep end. I do think you should have worked this out back when you really needed the money. Now you seem settled again - but if you really want to push this option go to counseling with her and maybe this will help you both communicate and work towards a common goal."

678,"Quote away, though I doubt that my words will change their view; people tend to use Confirmation Bias to determine which clergy to listen to, based on how much that person tells them what they already believe.

That said, however:

The ""Do not yoke yourself to an unbeliever"" thing *does* have valid application.  Not so much in the sense of relationships with friends, because each of your lives are your own.  But when it comes to life partners, if people's goals and motivations are radically different, they will be pulling the ""cart"" (so to speak) in different directions, and that means that the cart will either go nowhere at all, or it'll go in a direction that neither of them wants.  Having common fundamental beliefs and ideals is part of the compatibility that makes long-term relationships work.  So ""do not yoke yourself to an unbeliever"", to me, means ""do not try to accomplish a thing with people who wish a different outcome for that thing than you do"", and it's not about ""people with different beliefs are icky, or less worthy, or anything like that""."

You’ll also want to know if you own the home *and* the land it’s on if you plan to have it demolished (this is not always the case and it sounds like dad might not be the wisest investor). In the future, and I’m sure you already learned your lesson but it bears repeating; don’t sign anything until you read the fine print."
682,"I like the GC idea for a few reasons.  

1. It out manipulates her.  She used the gift exchange ""rules"" to put in her request but deliberately asked for something too expensive and is now refusing to provide alternatives.  She thinks that the ""rules"" obligate you to follow through on her request.  Nope.  The ""rules"" only obligate you to put in an honest effort to get an appropriate gift.  She thinks she can make the ""appropriate"" part really restrictive, but you can out-think her.

2. The GC allows you to specifically counter any criticism about how much you spent.  You ""cheaped out""?  Nope, you spent $250 to help her towards a new computer or other electronics.  How can you prove your generosity?  It is right there on the GC. 

3. As much as the other family says her behavior ""isn't a big deal"", they know it is.  They are just afraid of upsetting the status quo because they are afraid of the effort it would take to live with better principles and they are wary of how she will escalate.  When she pulls crap they are all secretly glad to see that someone else is taking the hit and they are secretly glad that it isn't them this time.  If she complains about not getting a luxury gift, they know she is out of line but they won't say anything because they are glad you have to deal with her greed, not them.  So, by showing that you won't be manipulated you are giving them a model of what it is like to live with a little more dignity and little less of throwing others under the MiL bus. [edit for format]"
683,"It's hard when your kids move away. You pour your love, your energy, your very life into these little people for almost two decades, and then suddenly they're gone. While you're trying new things and having new experiences, they're still living the same routine, which makes your absence really noticable. Little moments that they took for granted, joking over breakfast, asking after your day, watching a show together - they're suddenly reminded of them all the time.

That's not to say that you feel bad, or go back to calling them every day. Your parents gave you life because they want you to live it. They just want to be a part of it.

What I would suggest is get them on social media or text them often. When you think of something, just send your dad a text with whatever is on your mind. Take pictures of your room, your new text book, interesting scenery or, best of all, yourself, and send it to them. Send them funny memes, random jokes, whatever. Just find a new balance - one where you can still stay connected while still living your own life."
684,"Someone mentioned earlier that if I bring an inspector, I risk the inspector just straight up condemning the house and Demo’ing it. Would it be cheaper (tax wise) to have just a plot of land? "
685,"
This:

&gt;He’s a great person [...] I love him and he’s the only person that has actually cared about me. 

is disproven by this:

&gt;He also doesn’t take my concerns or feelings seriously.  [...] I don't like how he minimizes everything I care about. I feel like I'm not being listened to, like I'm a non-factor...I'll always be lesser, I just wish he wasn't so dismissive of me. 

A truly great person who is a caring partner would *never* make you feel this way. "
686,"The reason she said nothing. Is if she had she would have to acknowledge to herself that its ""wierd"". "
687,"Or, in my friend's case, her (now ex) husband got his STI treated before she even knew he'd passed it to her, then used his now-clean test to insist she was the cheater. Charming.

&amp;#x200B;

OP, get tested without telling him so at least you know what the hell is going on before you do anything else. And maybe don't have sex with him again until you do. Good luck--I hope we're wrong."
688,Lmao this is perfection. 
689,"""No."" is a complete sentence."
690,"&gt; 'everyone talks bad about their exes.'

This is what clinched the deal for me. He's so obviously saying he doesn't believe you 100% about what happened to you. He might genuinely be a decent-but-misguided guy, but you've been though enough - leave it to someone else to teach him.

At the end of the day, people break up for all sorts of incompatibility reasons, including really petty things. No one has to be the villain here in order to break up; it's enough that your feelings have changed, and you think it's going to take more work than it's worth to change them back. I 100% believe you can and will find another guy who has all the pros as this one, but without the unsettling disbelief of your actual lived experience.

Also, fwiw - all of my exes are great people, I am proof that his statement is complete bull."
691,"&gt; If she needs “new life” in the house to the point of guilting and manipulating her partner she needs a damn hobby. 

Ugh, yes, this. That line of the wife’s made me bitter and sad.

She needs a “new source of life” in the house? What about the *six other* lives in her house, four of which are actual humans, and three of those which actually need her parenting attention?

What incredibly selfish reasoning. I sincerely hope that wasn’t the motivation for having new kids as well - just chasing that “new life” feeling, without a care for how it affects the existing other lives in the house (or even how it affects that “new life” being brought in)."
692,"God forbid he had the same personality but was a woman. I'd love to see how he behaved having even things he knows explained to him constantly, I think his head would explode. Then again, he was likely conditioned not to allow things to be explained to him because he is a dude.

Before the notallmen folks get on my case, I'm not saying every guy is like this, just that male conditioning often includes the ingrained belief that it's emasculating somehow to have someone, especially a woman, explain how something works."
693,[removed]
694,"&gt;He keeps saying it's painful and will cost a lot.

Removal, absolutely. But covering it? Unless it's particularly large, that shouldn't be a big deal pain or money-wise, relative to tattoos in general. 

&gt;I even told him that I would love if he covered her name with his son's but he still says no

What was his reasoning for that?"
695,Agreed.  I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation that doesn't include him cheating on OP in some way.  Then the lying on top of it?  This looks bad.
696,"If you want to be really baller, take a really nice picture with your stepfather as he walks you down the aisle and post it all over social media so your father and everyone else can see it. 

I'm petty like that. "
697,"&gt; God, has he made some silly financial decisions. and hes only 21

Leave him before he starts expecting you to pay for your dates because he can't afford to. "
698,"She should have absolutely warned you and asked if you were okay with this. Not telling you put you in an uncomfortable situation and made you look like the bad guy to your nephew. And the fact that she suggested your husband sleep somewhere else and get kicked out of his own bed is just rude. 

&amp;#x200B;

Source: My nephew (5) slept over last week and I put him in his own room. He got cold and came down twice.  I would feel fine sleeping next to him, but I'm not sure I'd put my husband in that position. I actually went and laid down with him upstairs and came back to my own bed later. He's fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
699,"Exactly. Even if she was going to bed at 7:30pm and getting plenty of sleep, pestering and guilting someone when they say no to sex is horrible behavior on its own."
700,"I hate to say it man, but I don't think she's over him.  Earning his approval and placating his outbursts seems like a major priority for her, and that's problematic because it's been 7 months, she's dating you, and she is still unable to stand up for herself and have real boundaries / demand respect from other people.  You're right, she should hate him.  Even feeling indifferent towards him would be a major improvement.  Instead she still loves him.  But like, you know, a brother she used to fuck."
701,"Tech guys, sheeeesh.

Unprofessional and stupid. I don't care what the previous situation was, no one should have to deal with that crap."
702,"Nope. You are not. Spell it out for him. He is putting more effort into caring for a co-worker than he is his girlfriend. You have every right to be upset.

Question, has he had to buy gifts for co-workers on previous years? If so, why is this one so special? It's a problem, he needs to check himself and be honest with himself."
703,Fwiw he accused you of gaslighting while gaslighthing the fuck out of you
704,"I haven't looked at his in years. I will ask to see his, but he will probably get upset because that would imply I don't trust him"
705,"I think that is probably what I'm going to do. Even if he didn't mean it to be as offensive as it came off, I guess I just don't want to be with someone that could minimize something, that even with hard work, still effects me today. "
706,Run away from your sexist crappy boyfriend like the DEVIL is chasing you. Why would you knowingly accept unfair treatment?
707,That doesn't seem particularly intimate to me. If you're getting him a gift from a movie that was his halloween costume? It just seems thoughtful. Your friend seems to be conflating the two.
708,Your family doesn’t have to get raped up the ass by him. Don’t bother with ultimatums or therapy (though therapy for yourself without him is a good idea). Threats/ultimatums might make it better for a week but then he’ll be back to the same way. 
709,"If people bring up their kids, stop making comments like ""can't they do x for themselves?""- that's a surefire way to avoid this in the future. Stop making comments in general on their parenting. As for your friends being worried- I'd be a bit worried too if I was around someone who didn't know if they'd been vaccinated as a child, since that can directly affect other people's health "
710,"Yeah you're right that's definitely something I'll have to consider. 
I love him so much and I will find it really hard to leave him if it comes to that.

I'm hoping this is a once off and part of his coping/grieving.

Thanks so much for your reply - I'll definitely keep this in my mind "
711,A 7 year old having a meltdown over having to sleep alone is already maladjusted...
712,"Please think about your future social life. Doctors and Nurses. You are going to be surrounded by people of different faiths, Muslims, Hindus, Christians. You may even end up working at a Catholic hospital. Think about all of the lovely people you will need to distance yourself from to keep your girlfriend happy."
713,"Well, in the first place, the gym is not where most people (women especially) lose the bulk (pun intended) of weight. The kitchen is. Just know that. So nevermind about getting her to the gym. 

Also, most people don't really respond to negative reinforcement as much they do positive changes. So here's my 2 cents, which you can take or leave. 

For everything you're ""taking away"", you need to put something in that void that is almost just as fun or as fun and as enjoyable. It's the 'bag of sand' principle. You're yanking the monkey idol off the altar and replacing it with a bag of sand. Don't just yank the idol off. (In this case the idol is junk and fast food).

Some ideas: 

Meal plan with her or do it yourself and politely, in an upbeat way, offer to include a meal for her too 

Meal prep with her---play music, have a glass of wine or sparkling water with lime, dance around, have fun with it. 

Active dates. Take a walk, end with a picnic of fresh foods. Park the car at the end of the block in a ""nice"" neighborhood and look at the holiday lights on foot. Sip hot cocoa and hold hands and joke around. Go dancing, go roller skating, go bowling, go golfing. Go cross country ski ing. Go play tennis. Start easy, and make it FUN. 

Track your calories and challenge each other to go lower: 2000 at first, then 1800, 1600, and finally 1500. See how many 'streaks' of days in row of logging you can do. 

Get a FitBit and have contests to a certain steps, stairs, etc. Put a dollar in a ""kitty"" for every 1000 steps, winner takes the kitty each week. 

Stock the fridge with fruit, fresh veg with low fat dressing, pre made baggies of salads, frozen lite meals, etc. 

Take a ""tour"" of the nicer, healthier restaurants in town. 

Check out the healthy grocery store in town (Whole Foods, Natural Grocers) for slightly healthier junk food 

Buy some beautiful cookbooks and teach your children to COOK. This is a life long skill that will benefit them immensely. I am very thankful that my mom did this. 

Set up your home so that each room is inviting for simple living. Chaotic rooms with tons of noise and ""static"" creates stress, which triggers overeating in many. Create a world where being healthy feels like being part of your home. "
714,"&gt; You absolutely shouldn’t have been driving.

This caught my eye, too.  She can barely make it walking back into the house but he had her operating heavy machinery?!  Fucking psychopath!"

Sorry, but frankly, this is information his wife deserves to know."
716,"I 100% guarantee that someone cut Kelly off because she's a *fucking psycho* and she's making your situation all about herself.

&gt;I can guarantee that nothing will be done, it never is concerning her. She is the best worker they have - she's full time and sells a lot.

Then you definitely need to find another job, and/or stay home with your kids for a while.

&gt;We're supposed to have a retreat this weekend and we're supposed to share a room. Well that ain't happenin, I'll tell you that right now. How do I handle that? Do I pay for my own hotel room? Do I not go at all? 

DO NOT GO.
"
717,"Sorry, what a fucking piece of shit your fiancé is. He had a date at your place while your dad was dying. Wtf didn't he go with you? I know you're going through a lot, but you have to end this like now. This guy is literally making things worse for you while your dad is dying. You seriously don't need that. This guy sounds like a total clown and idiot. He's 35, Jesus. Be glad you saw him for who he was now before getting married. Don't even hesitate with ending this relationship. Sending good vibes your way, good luck."
718,"he’s never lied to you before, that you know of. I would be INCREDIBLY wary if I was you. If he is willing to lie about being written up at work, you have no idea what’s else he could have lied to you about. He could be having an affair for all you know. Maybe they didn’t go see a movie. Maybe they left to go have sex. Does he have a ticket stub? Or proof of purchase from the movie theatre? A receipt? "
719,Let him go. You're not a match. You'll find other people if you look.
720,"You're both right, for different reasons.

That's horrible for business and his boss should know that his employee is illegally using company information to ask women out.

Your girlfriend, being the one who's privacy was violated, has said she doesn't want to do anything about it. That's her decision. Let her be right.

At some point, he's going to find another cute girl and she'll tell his boss. Trust me, stupid people get theirs eventually."
721,"Yeah, when I read that line, hooooo BOY did I go from minimal rage to SEETHING HATRED for that dude instantaneously."
722,"If my significant other was embarrassed by my profession, that would be a dealbreaker to me. Personally, if you were my SO, I'd be bragging all over the place because being an apprentice chef in Japan sounds awesome af. But apparently your girlfriend cares more about keeping up with the Jonses than you. Again, I couldn't be with someone who wanted me to lie and lied themselves to friends about my profession. 

As an aside--good luck with your career! Sounds like you will be one incredible chef!!"
723,"So, the worst thing you've done that you can come up with is that you kissed another guy, and he anally raped you within the first two paragraphs of your post?

Hate to break it to you girl, but you *are* much better. It's not a high bar to clear and you do it easily.

And the only person who ""strings people along"" in an abusive relationship is the abuser. Isn't it a neat trick, making you feel bad for failing to love him (even though he hurts you) and for staying with him anyway (which he wants you to do, otherwise he'd have broken up with you)."
724,"Are these ""staycations"" where he's just taking time off work to recharge at home, or is he straight up abandoning your family with no notice for weeks at a time each year?

Either way, he's an asshole, but if it's the latter, I'm much less optimistic about the possibility of him coming around to seeing reason."
725,"&gt;he doesn't want to talk because he talks all the time in his professional life.

I'm sorry what the fuck? I wasn't aware that there was a finite number of words that a person is allowed to say in a day. He doesn't want to talk? Tough titties. In a mature relationship you TALK. About the easy things. About the hard things. If he can't do that, he's not ready for any relationship."
726,"The fact that it's so out of character makes me think more in the direction of a health issue. 

I don't think you should go home alone, just for safety's sake, but is there any way to get him to a doctor? "
727,"I mean, I know you said you don't have interest in those things, but you could learn enough about that topics to have a conversation with him. Read about those subjects and then you can consistently ask him ""have you read any good books lately? bought any new games? learned any new songs on the guitar? can I hear play? have you written anything lately? can I read it? wow this is really good! I read that book you told me about, it was interesting..."" etc etc etc. 

You may not be directly interested in these things, but you're clearly interested in your kid and these things are a bridge to get to him."
728,"And don't have sex with her again - if she's not pregnant by you *now*, she might be looking to 'fix' that...

No, not even with a condom - condoms can be tampered with."
729,I'm so sorry to hear this. Is she still in that situation or was she able to get out of it?
730,"Keep everything in writing. Especially the requests to return gifts. Make it in writing as to why you broke up. Cheating and dishonesty. 

If he blackmails you with pictures of your privacy and lofe together remind him that at some point he will want to get married/engaged again and that you can also blackmail him over his disgraceful attitude to the next future wife. Blackmail goes both ways. 

In the meantime, keep a good lawyer at hand and give him an ultimatum to accept the return of the gifts. If he rejects the ultimatum as well, then send them via lawyer together with a copy of all the evidence against cheating, lying and his ridiculously immature behavious. 

Been there, keep strong"
731,"I hate to tell you, but if he’s paying child support, then he has acknowledged that he’s the father. A woman can’t just “name” a man and just start receiving child support, otherwise tons of crazy women would be getting money from whatever man. He has signed something acknowledging it’s his child, and/or he has taken a paternity test. The state likes proof."
732,"Your sister deserves the truth. Both about what is making you uncomfortable and the fact that he has this effect on other women as well.  Yes, this may affect her decision regarding staying with him or divorce, but that would NOT be your fault.  It would be his fault for behaving that way.  His behavior is the problem, not you by reporting it.  

Tell your sister that you love her and your niece.  You weren’t going to bring this up but after bailing on the trip and trying to decide how to manage this new holiday invite, you need to tell her your reason.  

Tell her all about the last visit, including how your friend felt and the fact that your mom noticed this behavior by him. Let her know that you hate doing anything that would affect your relationship with her, but you cannot be comfortable around him.  "
733,"Thank you. I honestly can't tell if he actually wants me to clean more, because it's always said jokingly, and it's kind of bizarre since I do clean. He's one of those people that enjoys cleaning, whereas I clean because it needs to be done. Maybe he wants me to be a more enthusiastic cleaner? I'll have to talk to him about it when I'm not annoyed. "
734,Find a new job. This is just fucking disgusting
735,I'd like to second this sentiment. 
736,"Yeah, I don’t think we can overstate this. Breaking up with him and staying strong and having that unfaltering respect for yourself is *outstanding*. Stay strong, you’ve got this!"
737,"OP is downplaying this way too much, I don't care what he's going through. What he did was vile and disgusting and I would be furious right now. "
738,"Don't assume you won't be liable for the cost of the demolition. Sure, it may cheap/free to get it condemned, but you may have a responsibility (meaning, you'll have to pay) to put up a fence or demolish it or whatever the local laws require you to do."
739,Tell your father that hanging out with the women in the family will likely get you more girls in the long run than a bunch a guys farting and drinking on the couch.
740,No this is nonsense. Does mom get to peace out? Nope. Does she get a break from her high risk pregnancy? I don’t think so. He can act like a damn adult who put that high risk baby in there and go out of his way to make sure she’s doing okay. Welcome to parenthood. There are no days off without *both* parents being okay with it.
741,don't play with our anonymous emotions
742,"&gt; Whenever I tell her to try something alone she messes it up totally.

**LET.  HER.**

The only way you learn anything is by *doing.*

Let her DO THINGS.

I know, it sounds mean.  You will probably feel bad at first.  You will agonize that because of you, she ends up unemployed and homeless, or some other dire situation that you are cooking up.

Wrong.

First of all, *you are not the center of her universe.*  She had ways to keep herself clothed and housed and fed before you, and she will somehow manage if you walked out of her life tomorrow.  Yes, I know she wails, ""But you're my only hope, Obi Wan!""

No, you are not.  This is called manipulation, and she's fucking with the social contract in order to skate through life, banking on the sympathy of everyone around her to do all the icky, boring things in life.  (Speaking of which, question:  When was the last time she needed copious handholding when doing something super fun?  Does she need people to mash the keyboard for her when gaming, for example, while she stands by and wrings her hands over her inability to understand how a quest works?  Does she need people to do her hobbies for her?  Or does she outsource all of those, too?)

You know how baby birds learn to fly?  Mama pushes them out of the nest:  they figure it out or they are eaten by cats.  Mama can demonstrate all she wants, she can communicate all the theory, but at the end of the day, baby birds *do or do not do.*

Every time you complete a task for her, **you are hurting her.**

Stop hurting her.

Refuse to help, while reassuring her that you believe she is up for the task.  Learn to say, ""No, that will not work for me.""  Brace yourself for tears and recriminations, perhaps a doubling down on learned incompetence because she won't like that you're breaking with carefully honed rhythm of your relationship.  

**She will figure it out.**

You are thirty and far too old to fall for this.  Treat her like a goddamned competent, fully-functioning adult and **let her figure it out.**

P.S.  Go to Captain Awkward and start reading up on boundaries:  boundaries are to relationships as fences are to neighbors--good for both."
743,"If you otherwise have a good relationship with your dad, I would ask him to sit down and help make some lists:

First - list out ALLLLLL the work that needs to be done

Second - List the estimated cost of all that work

Third - list the time estimate of all that work

Then you can have a conversation with your dad of how the fuck he thinks you can afford to do this work and when the fuck you'd have time. 

ETA: Don't forget some work in some states MUST be done by folks with specific licenses. Also, you may need permission from the city/county to do certain work. You will also almost certainly need the house inspected and signed off on several times throughout the process. THERE IS A LOT OF LEGAL WORK THAT HAS TO HAPPEN HERE OR YOU CAN NEVER EVER SELL THIS HOUSE."
744,"Seconding, OP, you should absolutely ask for the sentimental things now. If necessary, say you're planning to scan the photos to build a proper family album of your own. And making a list of the things that can't be easily picked up is a good idea.

Not to sound alarmist, but you cannot expect people to have a sense of common decency about such things. Friends of mine lost their great aunt this spring, they got along great and visited her more often than her only daughter did. In the months leading up to her death, the aunt was actively telling them to take the sentimental stuff, take the family photo albums, etc., and they felt it was rude or too soon, so they never actually took anything. Like 2 days after her death, her daughter hired a company to clear out the apartment to put it up for sale; basically everything she didn't see potential resale value in went straight into garbage, including the albums.  "
745,"I want to quote your second paragraph to my ultra-religious relatives who feel the need to periodically remind me of my duty not to yoke myself to non-believing friends or significant others. (I myself am agnostic at best, but they don’t know that—ha, tricked them into yoking themselves to a non-believer!) "
746,"This is a very good point. I also hope there’s an open phone policy with your husband, OP. It sounds like he’s sulking and feeling like the victim here, when *he had an affair*. Emotional affairs are betrayal just like physical affairs are. He should be doing everything in his power to ingratiate himself to you. You really need to get into counseling ASAP to look into why you’re allowing your spouse to behave/treat you this way, and if you hope to salvage your marriage, he needs to be willing to go to therapy as well. Cut the other woman out of your lives entirely. Block her on social media, remove her contact info from your husband’s phone (I mean, I’d copy the info down first to keep an eye on our phone logs), and otherwise erase her from your lives. 

Have you talked to him about his obvious grief over the loss of this relationship? If it has been a while now, I honestly am beginning to think that salvaging your marriage may not be the best course of action. He needs some sort of repercussions for his actions, like realizing you have enough respect for yourself to leave him."
747,"Some wise words. 
I think that's possible. I keep telling myself that I'm not going to let them effect me, but maybe it's not working"
748,See if you can cancel your flight and get a credit with that airline to use at some point in the future. I think that might be a better way to go about this.
749,"How is it that he won't ""let"" you divorce? Are you in a non-US culture?"
750,"Yeah, and tell him if he wants you to get in shape like a celebrity mom he can get you a chef, dietician, maid, trainer, and an army of nannies like a celebrity mom has too."
751,"Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence. That's a very basic concept he's failing to grasp. His attitude toward people in general seems pretty shallow/self-centered as well. I enjoy sarcasm, but there's a line between being sarcastic and belitting someone.

Bottomline is if he cares about your feelings, he'll stop saying the disrespectful things that bother you. ""This is how it's gonna be"" is garbage. That's a one-sided relationship where you must agree to his needs while he shits on yours. You're not happy with the comments. That means it's time for them to stop. If he can't handle that, you should ask him why he's getting so triggered over showing his girlfriend some basic levels of respect."
752,"This is kind of the obligatory question, but are you positive you aren't the side chick?"
753,"&gt; I cheated on my wife one time 3 years ago with a friend from high school. We met for lunch and things just escalated

&gt; We exchanged Instagram details and text chat almost every day in French (my wife knew this from the start). I find her physically attractive, but am not interested in anything sexual.

Hmmmmmmmm. I wonder why your wife wouldn't like this. I wonder what could possibly be triggering her red flag meter. Jesus christ open your eyes.

You're literally doing the same thing as before. You're sexually attracted to this friend and things could easily ""escalate"" again. Her ultimatum is absolutely fair and you need to decide whether your marriage is worth saving. "
754,"Your dad practically fucking SOLD you to this guy!!!!!!!!!! What the fuck??????????

**edit:** OP honestly, your father at the very LEAST enabled your abuse by turning a blind eye, but I have suspicions that he had more of a hand in it than you realize. A POLICE OFFICER called him to report that you, his underage child, were in a cheap motel room with this ""youth pastor"" that your father had ""an online friendship"" with and he was *totally OK* with that? There is no way on god's green earth that a normal parent would *ever* condone such a thing. Either your dad set you up or he's literally the stupidest person alive.

**edit again:** OP, despite how enraged my comment sounds (and I *am* enraged by what was done to you), I agree with u/aprevo11 - you do not have to do *anything* drastic right now. It is OK to take all of this at your own pace, and you should. I would definitely start by calling RAINN or another resource that works with victims of sexual abuse. "
755,Stop! Collaborate and listen. 
756,"Easy. He cheated and got an std. He took care of it and hid the evidence but he's pretty sure he gave it to you. He doesn't want to get reinfected so he's pressuring you to get tested. When it comes back positive he'll accuse you of cheating or come up with some bullshit way you could have gotten it without cheating and try to move on like he didn't do anything.

"
757,"&gt;I told my friend I wanted to establish some boundaries between us and to no longer contact me unless **she was contacted first.**

Wait what? And you were surprised she was upset? Did you give any explanation? "
758,"You should absolutely dump him, but you shouldn't do it until you're CERTAIN that there are no other photos (or god forbid, videos) of you. Play nice until you can be SURE. Even then, honestly, I would think about reporting him to the police and/or talking to a lawyer about it."
759,"You know when I say “fuck it” and jump into something with someone without thinking about the consequences?

When I have a crush. "
760,"Here, we have a hero"
761,"&gt;So I feel like such an asshole for thinking his opinions are too much for me.

It's not that his opinions are too much for you, it's that his opinions are those of a moron.  "
762,"Stop judging yourself by your intentions and others by their actions.   You are too close to your friend to help and honestly your friend is being a garbage boyfriend.  The term for involving another party in assuaging guilt or problem solving is triangulation and it is an indication of enmeshment/poor boundaries.  I do think you two were cruel and I am side-eyeing the criticism of the girlfriend here. You guys poisoned the well by your behavior in private, like when 2 friends gossip about the 3rd and then act 15% meaner the next time there is a group activity.  You both should reflect on how you guys create a sense of exclusivity that is threatening to romantic partners.  




Personally I'd apologize for my own behavior and avoid justification. Because it is mean, and you should apologize when you're mean to people."

&gt; Following this he pushed over our coffee table, threw a whole bookcase over, and a small cabinet type thing with records in it

&gt; has had anger issues and thrown things but never like this

&gt; not emotionally abusive

How is saying something to you like ""stop feeling sorry for yourself"" after you've found out that you may have an inheritable degenerative genetic condition NOT emotionally abusive?
"
767,"&gt;How can we help her overcome these feelings?

You unequivocally tell her: You're not a burden. You've never been a burden. You're a blessing in our lives, and we would be sadder and poorer without out. You're our daughter. Period. We would walk through hell to get you. 

Then you tell her to start picking extra curricular events to attend. Make them a priority and attend them. Your actions will overcome her doubts. 

"
768,"I can’t stand that phrase. Siblings don’t have sex. Ever. You don’t go from banging your sibling to being in a platonic, family relationship. Nothing about that makes sense, everything about it is nasty. Not to mention that it’s a bullshit thing people say when they are romantically interested in another person. Just get out of there."
769,"Yeah, no. This is a bad idea all around, and honestly if he's not over her he shouldn't be in a relationship and make you wait around until he's had his space so he can get over her. He should have thought about that before entering this relationship and stringing you along.

If he is adamant about going to this sleepover with the lowering of inhibitions with the alcohol and weed (who the hell has sleepovers at 22 years old) with his ex there, I would not be there when he got back.

Period."
770,"IMO what I’m getting from this is that is exactly what will happen if you stay. 

The big world is scary and he wants his security blanket (you) as long as *he* needs. He wants you to change so he’s happier in a marriage where he is the one fucking things up. 

His mindset is absurdly self centered. "
771,"This reminds me of a relationship that I was actually in 10 years ago. He had this ""friend,"" it was soooooo innocent, and I was just jealous and crazy, yadda yadda. Anyway they were having a full blown affair, at least as full blown as it could get while living across the country. She 100% knew about me, in fact they talked about me a lot and she would say catty things. Finally he actually lied to me and flew cross country to visit her at Thanksgiving. I dumped him.

When I dumped him? SO DID SHE. She did not actually want him but she did like the attention and the ego boost from getting someone who was involved with someone else to do this with her. Once he was fully single, she was not interested. 

I'd be VERY unsurprised if the same happens in your case. "
772,"&gt;He complains that he already doesn't have enough free time, 

Oh, boo hoo, then he shouldn't have brought a child into the world. 

I'd suggest couples counseling, but I'd imagine he'll say that takes up too much of his precious time. "
773,Haha I wanted to add a little suspense there and thank you! It's been really wonderful.  
774,"She doesn't have an abusive partner, but guess what? You do. *Her* actions were bordering on physical abuse against *you*. That kind of thing only ever gets worse, not better. And what she said? That was a threat, made in an attempt to control and intimidate you. You sound like a sweet, thoughtful guy, prone if anything to bending over backwards a little too far to make sure you're being fair in an argument. You deserve better.

Edit:

&gt;I feel so upset by it that I feel she should be trying very hard to prove to me she didn’t mean it, and instead I get suggestions **I am partly to blame by making her angry**

777,"&gt; can't your kids cook their own dinner so we can go out?

This honestly is really rude, and it's not just because your sense of normal is different.  You're telling someone else to change the way they parent so that you can go out with them.  It's a nice criticism and selfish statement wrapped up into one question.

It's less about learning to recognize topics and more about learning how to accept people's answers and not question the reasons they give. "
778,"A little money is better than no money and bills.  I'd take the little capital you get from sales and invest it elsewhere.  Since it is technically *your house*, you should be well within your rights to do so. "

Sounds like he may have just be frustrated/tired which is not right to take out on you, but doesn’t sound relationship-threatening. I’d talk to him and tell him why it bothered you. 

Side note - was it your left hand you cut? A girl I knew smashed her fingers (nails fell off but she’s was okay) a week before her boyfriend was planning to propose and he was really mad about it not because of what happened, but because he had to scramble to replan because he knew she didn’t want to show everyone her new ring on her injured and scary looking hand. Just a thought!!!"
780,"""I feel like that is an unfair way to look at it because I married my wife  because I love her and want to have kids with her and that's what she  wanted too....I thought."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever told you life was supposed to be fair wasn't looking out for your best interests.  Life very often, in fact most of the time, is not fair.  Look you didn't do anything wrong here, you did all the right things, your wife either lied or changed her mind.  There really isn't much to be done here other than either choose to stay child-free yourself (which I highly advise against if that isn't what you want), or to have a come-to-Jesus conversation with her where you let her know that you WILL be having children in your life, and she needs to decide if it will be with her or not.  But there is unfortunately no middle ground here, and I would say that if both of you feel strongly then neither of you should ""give-in"" to appease the other.  You still have a lot of time to find a partner who wants what you do in life, I suggest you use it.

783,"This is against the code of conduct of basically _every_ sporting organization. Gabe could at least be sanctioned by his sports governing body. If he's having an active affair with one of his students, he could get banned from competitions and lose his support from his governing body (e.g., insurance, etc.). Unfortunately a lot of governing bodies turn a blind eye or sweep things under the rug. However, times are changing, and that plan didn't work out so well for USA Gymnastics. "
784,"Throw the husband in the trash. Seriously, this is vile abusive behaviour and there is no way he can come back from this. He degraded you. I don't think it's worth a therapist to repair this.

People are commenting about this being 'out of character'. Who knows, it may be his true form. It's not uncommon for abusers to strip their deceptive shell and show their true selves after advances of commitment  in the relationship (marriage, children, moving in together, buying high value items together) where it's harder for one party to leave. You've only been married a few months so him acting like this now is bang on brand for abusers."

787,"&gt;Some said that she was young and she just needed to explore, others said that it happened a while ago and that i should just get over it. 

What kind of people would say that? Pretty sure if I said to my parents my SO cheated on me they would tell me to leave her. It's like your friends/family are enabling her. 

You even said you wanted to leave her so why ask your relatives about it ? It's YOUR decision to make. "
788,"Wow, this is so heartwarming to hear! You know a couple of years ago, if you'd asked me if I would ever have the courage to challenge family tradition, I would have told you I'd never ever be able to. I'd have said I was just going to sacrifice myself to my parents' wishes, and that a life of freedom was for other people in different circumstances, not for people like me or with parents like mine. But so much has changed since then... Anything is possible. Please stay strong and write to me on Reddit sometime if you need a friend! :)"

795,"&gt; she must have thought

Did you ever have a conversation about this?

&gt; I knew for sure it was personal 

This is when you go to your professor and ask them why you got the marks that you did - that you feel your work deserves better but that maybe you just don't understand. You ask for a reasonable explanation. When you don't get that reasonable explanation, you go to the department head. Or you go to the department head from the start.

Be careful to not sabotage yourself."
796,"LOL what? You're literally a dozen feet away from him in another room and he expects you to text him when you want to go into his room? That's WEIRD and is not a big deal at all. Either he gives you a damn good reason why he wants you to text before entering or you need to seriously reconsider this relationship. I'm guessing this isn't the only thing he'd be annoyed about. 

As an aside, my SO and I will occasionally sleep in separate rooms so one of us falls asleep together and then leaves for the other bedroom and then we meet again in the morning. Texting before coming back to bed to be together never crossed my mind."
797,I find it really hard to believe that this is only about a dream. You can't look at your wife of 20 years because you had a dream? You need to speak to a professional about this.

What kind of man is at home by himself while his SO is gone, working or whatever, and doesn't think, ""Hm, maybe I should do this for SO! That'd be really nice.""

I don't think this is so much about you having high cleaning standards. It's the fact that he's being inconsiderate. If you've scrolled through relationships before, you'd realize that you're not the first (or the last) person to post about this issue. This issue is enough to break up relationships.

He's put you in the role of being the designated household caretaker which isn't fair or equal in any sense. To come home and immediately clean the kitchen and bathroom because he couldn't be bothered to do it is absurd.

You've had discussions, he hasn't changed. I'd recommend not living together anymore. Seriously. You're not his maid, his mom, his third parent. He's a grown man and you shouldn't have to be cleaning up after him. You're not a nag when you're doing all this extra work whereas he's just dismissing it.

This is a serious issue. There are some people saying you should have a chore calendar, but why? Why put you in the role of manager of the house when, again, this is a grown man? It's obvious that you fucking wash clothes. It's considerate to fold them up and put them away. It's obvious that you don't piss on the floor and if you do, you clean it up. It's obvious that you shouldn't have to jump to being a maid the minute you walk through the door."
805,"Agreed. I'd literally say ""nope i'm not a lawyer i'm an apprentice chef"" and be damn glad saying it. Then i'd probably break up with her"
806,"Would you have married him if he had told you his truth? 

He springs a 10 year or more lie by omission and then states you have to fix yourself. The utter gall of the man is astonishing, 

And just who did he take that picture for? What has been motivating his change in grooming and weight loss. I would demand the freedom of his accounts to confirm he hasn't tested out his sexuality. 

I could not be with a person, so devious and scared of their own truth. 

"
807,"That's not an apology. Saying that ""I feel bad"" is never an apology.  Your entire statement is about *you*, not her.  A real apology is admitting you screwed up, making zero excuses, and creating a plan going forward to rectify the situation.  Saying ""It wasn't meant to be rude"" is downplaying how she feels about the nickname.  Telling her to ""Just yell at me"" is trying to assume her emotional state/desires--is yelling at you what Veronica McVampire would do?

Honestly your obligation in all of this is to Veronica/Kate, not Nate.  While your intentions weren't bad, the optics/situation is too messy to not make a major ""mea culpa"" to her, and it's going to suck for your friendship with Nate.  I would text her something along the lines of:

""Hey, I'm really sorry about the nickname we used for you.  There is no excuse that would make it okay, and I should have told you about it as soon as you two became serious.  After seeing how it made you feel, going forward I will never use that nickname again.  If you decide to stay with Nate, I will happily take some time away from hanging out with him while you work through this.  The *last* thing I would want to do is exacerbate this shitty situation I helped create.  If/when you are comfortable with me being around again, but there are necessary boundaries on me and Nate's friendship going forward, I will completely understand."""

If it's any consolation, I'm sure she isn't thrilled you work with him everyday, or will see you at functions. You are not out of his picture. She's an asshole, but she has to live with your presence too. Although she is a blow to your dignity, you are blow to her's as well."

812,"I lean towards the mental/physcial health issues, but his specific words (""How many other people have you made cum?"") and the fact that it happened immediately after his orgasm do suggest a guilty conscience on his part.

824,"I partially understand your girlfriend’s reaction - it can be hard to feel emotionally positive towards someone whose closely held belief would limit your right to your own bodily autonomy. But her reaction is a little intense, so maybe there’s something else going on. 

One in three women will have an abortion at some point in their lives. There’s a fairly high likelihood that either she herself has had an abortion and never told you or one of her nearest and dearest have had one. Have you ever talked about what her personal experience with abortion is? Has she ever had a pregnancy scare where she viscerally realized how utterly her life would be derailed if not for access to abortion? These things are more intense when they happen to you, and it can be painful to hear people you love speak dispassionately about something you feel so personally and intensely. (To have fun arguing, like sport! About something that affects your body and your life!) 

I’m partially playing devils advocate here as I personally support being able to have those conversations about differing views with people we love, but I understand that for some people they simply can’t do so because it’s too personal and too intense. 

Is she politically active and an outspoken feminist in other parts of her life? Or is this an aberration for her? Maybe there’s something else going on. "
825,"OP, you have some phrasing in this post that you seem to view as absolute truths, that suggest that your disordered eating is not under control yet. Losing weight should happen in a controlled manner, but it seems a bit like this is a bit more than just weightloss concerning you. Do talk to some medical professional. You had a relapse and that might bleaken whatever your 'norm' is, because then everything seems worse. But it might be that your current baseline in how you approach all of it is off to start with, meaning you end up with roadblocks later in your attempts. "

832,"I think this is a really mature and diplomatic, but clear reply. Keep in mind that you don't control their responses. They may take a step back to reflect and be mature about them being too eager, they may go down screaming and kicking in one big drama fest, or anything in between. You don't control that and their behaviour is not yours to fix.

If they get nasty, reconsider being friends with them. You do get to choose on which people you spend your time and energy. You don't have te be friends with someone who isn't a good friend. If they keep bringing this up, they are not good friends.

Take care of yourself. I hope they can be mature about having been too forward, but if they choose to kick up drama and call you names, know it's not you. It's them being nasty.

833,"Look, you're in an abusive relationship and there's no getting around that. And TBH the abuse seems to be going both ways from the way you describe your argument style. But forget all that.

Forget the logistics for a second.

Forget all those ""but it'll be so hard"" thoughts and the ""it'd be too messy or too complicated"" or that ""it'll ruin his life"" thoughts.

Just think about your kids: do you want this horrible relationship to be the model to which your children look up to? Do you want them to think it's ok for their future spouses to buy fucking spy cameras? Is that what a happy trusting relationship looks like?

They deserve to see a happy mom and a happy dad. And it's crystal clear that will not happen under one roof. And there's nothing wrong with that.

It's far better for you and your kids (and your husband) to be happy apart than miserable together. He clearly has no desire to work on things: he won't even attend therapy regularly and it doesn't sound like he's taking it seriously. This is over, and it sounds like it's been over for a while. It's just a matter of ripping off the bandaid."
834,"I wanted to pop in and agree with all of this. I have PTSD as well from an abusive relationship. The PTSD was severe but I refused to give up on treatment. 

I never told my now boyfriend much, though he knows that I went through it and have been physically and emotionally abused. 

And yep-he said the exact same thing. 

It definitely was a PTSD trigger and i felt like it was the ex husband. I started thinking of him like my ex husband. How dare he not trust me! How dare he accuse me of lying! 

But thanks to the treatment, I realized this. So I was able to re-center myself, come back to earth, and let myself get very very angry. 

I was angry for the misogyny. 
I was angry for other women. 
I was angry that he didn’t communicate empathy. 

And as a woman, that anger was justifiable. 

I talked to him about how angry I was, but for the right reasons instead of the reasons my triggered episode brought up. 

I showed him my scars and the picture of me in the hospital bed and I said for the love of his fucking mother he better not doubt a woman he cares for ever again. 

This resolved it. There was no debate. There was no attempted justification. He saw that anger and passion and knew how wrong he was.

This was about a year ago. It kicked something off in him that caused him to start looking past the surface of most women. Paying more attention to them outside of those stereotypes. And in turn he has started spreading that same attitude in his friends, unintentionally. Leading by example. 

I was able to turn that trigger into justifiable anger and that saved not just my relationship, but also the world from a little bit of excess misogyny. I love this man and he is finally starting to pull his paranoid head out his ass. Turns out he has triggers like me. 

My advice is to take care of yourself and get rid of  any delusional thinking. See why you are really upset about it underneath, and then approach that with passion. That is, if you want to be committed to this relationship. Even if you aren’t sure about it, try that method regardless because you can always make up your mind later and this skill will be good for you to pick up. 




"
835,"&gt; **It's disrespectful to our neighbours**  
We  share a small space and live in close quarters to many people. There is  virtually no sound-proofing. I've talked to him about how I feel this  isn't respectful to our neighbours, but he insists it isn't a big deal  because it's only for a couple weeks a month. Our neighbours have  started complaining in our neighbourhood Facebook group, which probably  means we have some sound violations and fines coming in the mail too. 

This alone would be a deal breaker for me.  He seriously is so self-absorbed that he doesn't think this is a problem? No thanks."
836,"&gt;I don't feel unsafe.

Why not? He's already violently raped you once. 

&gt;Should we try therapy?

Absolutely not. A good therapist will refuse to take on a couple in an abusive relationship, and a bad therapist will take your money and not help, or even make it worse. 

Protecting yourself isn't giving up. "
837,"This is a good start and you seem like a great sister for caring. My advice to you is to follow up on it - take time out of your day/week to go talk to her, ask her how she’s doing, do activities with her, etc. As a kid sometimes you’re not used to putting yourself out there and advocating for yourself, so hearing “I’m here for you, come to me if you need anything” is frustrating. I’m saying this based on feedback from my little sister. I wish I had taken a more active role in her life earlier on, but we’re very close now. "

839,"I think your opinion is spot on. His decision to come out is HIS decision to make if and when he feels comfortable, but being in the closet doesn’t mean that he needs to post fake romantic pics on social media with a girl. Especially if he’s in a relationship, I would feel somewhat disrespected too.

Have you talked to him about how you feel? Is it possible he’s worried about what others think and maybe he thought posting a pic like this would convince people that he’s straight? "
840,"Oh that's definitely going to happen. Shortly after the initial post, he tried to tell me he was about to lose his house (trying to get out of helping me) not even a week later hes posting pictures of his brand new 2018 Dodge Challenger... I just laughed and blocked him on social media. "

843,"People don't like hearing that you're not doing anything, they are trying to be nice by inviting you to join them.

Just tell them thanks but you've made ""other plans."" Doesn't matter if the other plans are to do nothing, don't explain that part. "
844,"Omg, seriously. He's the one that threw a fit over not being able to do something that is *designed* to work as simple as possible. He wasn't angry at her nagging, he was angry at his own ineptitude and was taking it out on her."
845,"Many people consider “gave in” sex as rape, because your no was ignored.

846,"This is absolutely what it sounds like to me, especially considering OP said their relationship has been wonderful otherwise. Depending on what she actually said about him to Josh (maybe it was horribly nasty?) he probably just poorly expressed his insecurity.

I really hope this rises higher than all the, ""Dump him!"" responses in this thread. This demands a serious conversation because it was inappropriate, but I don't think this is quite dealbreaker material."
847,This makes a lot of sense and has definitely given me something to think over. Thank you. 
848,"That sounds great, but be wary; communication is important, but don't romanticize normal communication. You're setting the bar too low after a bad relationship. Him calling you to tell you his phone is broken is basic communication! It's included with the package!"
849,"Why on earth wouldn't he just leave you a note and food $?

And yes, he probably did want to go to Spain for this exact reason. He should have been upfront about it, by the sound of it I doubt you would have minded if you went to Spain or a neighbouring country that made his errand possible.

In a few years you'll laugh about it but your reaction right now is normal."
850,Sorry if he can't afford to cover you since his work contract is ending then why is he spending so much money doing something for a coworker's birthday? That's....a really bizarre excuse since it suggests he can't really afford it either.

854,"&gt;**You think the problem is that you just haven't found the magic words to make him see how he's hurting you. What you don't get is that he DOES know he hurts you. He just doesn't CARE (or worse yet, he LIKES that he can hurt you and you just keep taking it).**

Emphasized because this is an important point and very true to the situation at hand. He doesn't care and we can't help her make him care"
855,"It sounds like your boyfriend is incredibly entitled. You should make it clear to both him and his mother that you're a student on a tight budget and in future years they are going to be getting more student-appropriate gifts like drawings, coupons for hugs and personalized spotify mixes.

I wonder what's driving his 'not good enough 'attitude. Is this your first Christmas with his mom? He may be nervous about you making a good impression and is overly trying to control the situation."
856,You're getting interviews? That's at least half the battle. 
857,"&gt; He constantly asks me to speak to him about my worries or any issues I have regarding him/the relationship and when I don't, he says that the relationship will never improve if I don't open up and speak to him honestly.

He is setting you up for failure here if he's soliciting your feedback and then immediately shutting it down. Usually with this sort of thing it's that they're looking for reassurance about the relationship or for you to validate that everything is fine. But clearly that's not the case and he's not really interested in giving you support or letting you air out your concerns.

I don't think that this is sustainable."
858,A couple hundred photos spread out over four years is nothing. You you stop apologizing and start getting angry. 
859,"&gt;Anything less, you need to respect yourself and make an exit plan

I very strongly second this. She's absolutely, no doubt about it, having an emotional affair and I would be ***shocked*** if it wasn't physical as well. OP needs to treat this exactly as it is; dealing with infidelity. If OP feels he can get over this she needs to go absolute zero contact with Gabe because she's already proven she can't be trusted with respecting boundaries and counseling is a requirement, not just to help move on but for her to show she is willing to take actual action to make things better"
860,"&gt;My mother has been wanting my sister to leave for years, so she would do anything to make that happen.

I think your mom is going into this with her eyes open and will be fine with your sister cutting contact.    There's really no need for you to butt in here, especially since your sister could easily lie and claim she never said any of this to you.   Just let it play out.  It's entirely possible that your mom and sister will repair their relationship once your sister is out of the house.   It's also just as possible that your sister will find out it's expensive to own a house and she'll come back to your mom for more money.  You can jump in then if you want but let it go for now."
861,"I'm confused . . . she did something that she knew would piss off her dad and she said you should protect her? Protect her and keep her safe from what? Her own stupid decisions?

There's literally nothing you could've done. This isn't one of those moments in a movie where your relationship is tested on whether you disrespect her dad in his own house or not. If she's going to break up with you for not standing up to her dad, let her. Her dad is not your problem, it's hers."
862,"Going through the comments, I'm getting the sense that you're hesitant to get a lawyer, but you really need one.  At the very least, you need a consult.  

It's not wrong of you to move with your daughter because some guy who donated DNA to her creation wants to not feel like a shitheel for one day a week.  "
863,"This right here. Tell him get over himself, stop whining and complaining, and step up to be a father and husband. I dunno when ""introvert"" became another word for lazy..."
864,+1 for this. When I was a kid there weren’t car seats or bike helmets or really too many safety rules. There was a smoking section at my high school. So it’s definitely not the fact you were raised differently. It’s your delivery and judgemental comments that are off putting. 
865,"Are you working on this issue? Are the two of you planning on ever having kids? Holy shit, I don't want to imagine your kid waking you up in the morning. The trauma inflicted upon you as a child is not your fault, but your behaviour is still unacceptable in my opinion."
866,"Holy shit dude, you need a lawyer ASAP. This is way above Reddit's paygrade. You need to protect the paternity support he has been paying you in funds and goods, it has been well-established. I'm so sorry."
867,"It sounds like she's 100% not committed to you and certainly doesn't respect your relationship in the slightest. If she hasn't cheated on you yet, she's gearing up to do so soon. I think you know what you need to do, OP. You'll be a lot better off without her! "
868,"Also, save the messages."
869,"It's pretty fucking rude to bring home food and eat it in front of all of you and not share. If he's going to do that, fine (I guess?), but he could have the damn courtesy to NOT do it in front of you."
870,Then move on. Don't stay in a relationship with a guy you can't trust. You've been through too much shit and have too much responsibility as a mother otherwise IMO.
871,"Is it just me or does anyone else notice a pattern where males in a relationship who are about 8-10 years older are always the ones that do these kind of “jokes”  it’s sort of like the reason they got with someone younger is so that they can be above someone and these jokes just magnify the obviousness of their blatant decision to be with a younger person so they can shit all over and make feel bad. Like the younger person will never live up to them but they kind of want to keep it that way at least in he younger persons mind. Just a theory. And non judgmental —prob just hitting close to home if anything. ;)

Edit: another theory is that millennials can’t clean ? That’s what my older BF just told me -__-"
872,Indifference towards you uprooting your life to stay with him is a bit concerning. 
873,"Put your personal items that have sentimental value someplace she doesn't have access, like a locked trunk or closet. Moving out asap would be a good idea.

Avoid giving her contact info for your friends and SO from now on. You could ask people in your life who she already contacts to block her number.  "
874,"&gt;because he is dealing with depression...

nope nope nope. I have depression too, it never caused me to behave like he does. He had depression before you came along and he'll have it after you go, that's not your problem and it's not something you can really help him with anyway. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."
875,"Quite honestly, I would stand your ground here.

You did not mislead her - you planned a wonderful vacation with your girlfriend. She and her friends came to the conclusion that you would propose. An appropriate reaction upon finding out would be for her to feel perhaps a bit embarrassed and then have a mature discussion about both of your desires/expectations for a future engagement so that there are no more misunderstandings.

A good final thing to say on the matter might be: ""Look, I have expressed to you that I do want to get married in the future and I love you very much. I would love to talk more about both of our expectations for that and make sure we are both happy. However, I'm not proposing on our trip. I envisioned it being an amazing vacation for us in addition to me being able to see my family. I am still going, with or without you.""

Your girlfriend needs to explore her motivations for wanting to be engaged, because from an outside perspective, it sounds like it's very image-driven. That's a red flag to me.

EDIT: Typo."
876,"&gt;This is on him to fix.

No. Calling this girl a nickname behind her back is incredibly rude, no matter the context.

Op should straight up apologize. "
877,"&gt;I’m not that type of girl that shows the guy that I like that I’m interested

Well, there's your problem. If you want something, you have to go out and get it. You can't just sit there and wait for someone to bring it to you."

This is an incredibly terrible thing to be dealing with, and while you're obviously a big support for your sister, this is a situation where adult needs to be involved. Tell your parents everything you know, and I am sure that they will take appropriate actions. This is bullying, and needs to be dealt with severely. As for what *you* can do, please tell her everything you just mentioned in your post. She may not be ready to hear it now, but I'm sure she will appreciate to hear how much you look up to her. Much love to you and your sister. "
881,Very good point 
882,"Wow, I missed that on first read-through. Makes complete sense, considering this guy’s got the maturity of a teenager.

In conjunction with the laziness, the video game addiction, the constant arguing and gaslighting...OP can do *so much better*, both for herself and for her child."
883,"Absolutely not. This is an HR issue, your colleagues all sound disgusting and unprofessional and it’s a wonder that your boyfriend doesn’t see that. Tell him if he’s so keen on meeting these assholes he can go while you stay home, because you don’t want to see them any more than you have to, "
884,"Then what's holding you back? Talk to a lawyer, figure out logistics, find out how to protect yourself and your assets, and then tell him about it."
885,"&gt;She has used the same travel company several times and she went on it for 3 months shortly after I first started seeing her (before we were monogamous), and before that trip she said ""Are you ok with me sleeping with other people on the trip?"" now things have changed and we have been dating a year but I know what goes on with these trips when you have a group of drunken 20 some year olds all staying in hostels together.

So there's your way in to talk about this:

""Darling, last time you went on one of these it was before we were exclusive, and you were free to hook-up if you wanted. But, obviously things have changed, so I just wanted to check in on this. I've got to admit, it's been wearing on my mind and I guess I am looking for a little reassurance. Can we talk about it?"""
886,It is as cut and dry as that. Dump her and see who she runs to.
887,Oh my gosh yes break up with him. He is literally telling you that he expects you to act like a maid. He's sexist and his thinking is flawed. Do not marry this man. 
888,Play the audio in front of her. Go from there. Don't make decisions on anything else until you have more info.
889,"This is incredibly abnormal and makes me think that there are a lot of other issues with this woman. Read up on Jocasta complexes - that could be what you're dealing with here.

Next time she brings it up, say ""You know Karen, you seem to talk about your son's penis quite a lot. It makes me really uncomfortable. Maybe we can stop talking about that.""

I would also encourage you to talk to your husband and have him set a clear boundary with her that she isn't to bring up circumcision or his penis anymore."
890,"OP please listen: I was your sister, 15 years ago. I was voted the ugliest girl in class, and it fucking shattered me. I never told my parents or the teachers, and the trauma of being bullied has literally followed me my entire life. I still vividly remember the moment I was told, what I was wearing, what the notebook page with all the tally marks looked like when it was shoved into my hands. The boys had voted, but the girls in my class were the ones who circulated the poll. I was (and instantly knew I was) completely alone. From that day forward, I couldn't trust a single person I had ever considered a friend.

I finally told my therapist *this year* about the incident and broke down completely. I can promise you this is not the first time your sister has been bullied, and it will not be the last time. Please, please, **please**: tell your sister that you know, and tell your parents. She might get upset with you &amp; there may be some social blowback for ""snitching"" but you do not want to look back in 10 years and wonder what if. I developed PTSD from bullying, spent decades battling depression, and attempted suicide multiple times. I am still, nearly 30 years old, struggling to rebuild my self-esteem because of the mean things a bunch of teenagers said about me in middle and high school.

Please help your sister. As you said, she's your best friend and takes good care of you whenever you need it. She needs you to take care of her now, even if she's not ready to admit it's what she needs."
891,"I’m bisexual and this situation happens to me a lot. People frequently try to “give me away” as well, assuming because I’m gay I want to participate. 

I also struggle with turning people down hard. Often they are nice people but I just don’t want to sleep with them. 

What you’re describing though is not nice people. Certain women like to “give” other women to their boyfriends. Like a present. These people do not see you as a person. She may see you as a way to please her boyfriend in bed and he sees you as a sex object. 

Don’t feel bad. You’re gut is right. Run. "

896,"&gt; LOL what? You're literally a dozen feet away from him in another room and he expects you to text him when you want to go into his room? That's WEIRD and is not a big deal at all.

Yep. The only reasons I can think of why he’d get so irrationally angry over something so normal:

- He was doing something he didn’t want OP to know about (my old cocaine-addicted roommate used to act the same way). In which case he’s an untrustworthy liar.
- He’s just acting like an asshole so he can have a power trip over OP (which is in line with his behavior in OP’s previous post).
- This wasn’t intentional, and he’s just naturally an asshole

These all sound like fantastic reasons for OP to dump this disrespectful, immature jerk."

It sucks that your dad doesn't believe you now; it also sucks that he didn't protect you when you were younger. It's OK to be angry at him about that: he failed you as a father and he's continuing to do so.

Unfortunately, it's very common for people - even the victims' parents - to not believe victims. "
901,"“Yeah Dad, because having a sausage party in the basement most of the time screams straight.”

That being said, you are now 30. If you are set on having (multiple) children you need some answers for him. I don't think Men think about this in the same way women do because they can technically have children forever. We can't. 

I would present the issue like that. If he isn't sure if he will ever be ready you need to end it for your own happiness. If he wants to continue the relationship and promises marriage sometime in the future you need a timeline. One that includes you guys getting married in the next 3ish years at the latest. "
907,"I mean.. your communication is bad. You have to tell your partner when something is a turn off, you know? With words "

910,"&gt; My sister is desperate for a child with no health issues, who she says ""would actually love her”

Omg. I’m a behavioral therapist who works with autistic children and a speech pathology student who knows stuff about people with DS. What she said is just fucked up. I know that some people with autism will never be functional enough to intentionally demonstrate love, but so many of the little guys I work with, INCLUDING THE VIOLENT ONES with fairly serious behavior problems, obviously love their parents. True, some of them could not give a damn when mom comes to pick them up, but others stare desperately at the door and light up when mom or dad walk through it. Many of my clients with autism are very sweet and affectionate. Shit, just the other day one of them was hugging me goodbye and spontaneously said “I like you.” I just take care to notice the warning signs of them losing control over themselves. And people with DS are well-known for their happy, friendly personalities—they are perfectly capable of loving a parent. 
And your sister is also very selfish, because as much as I adore my clients, some of them are absolutely not trustworthy around a new baby. Not because they would intentionally hurt a baby, although they might, but because they might throw things, have a violent meltdown, have little awareness of the location of their bodies in space, etc. Your sister wants to put YOUR baby in a house with a bunch of violent, older kids who apparently don’t love their mom.

Edit: Oh and your parents. Your parents!! They are maladjusted as hell. Their ridiculous response is just inexcusable for functioning adult humans. “How dare you not literally give away your firstborn child to your sister as a band-aid, how can you be so selfish that you won’t let the baby live with much larger, violent children!” Like ... seriously?"
911, This is extreme parenting and should have been brought up and planned for.  Some compromise may have been possible like have a sleeping bag on the floor. Your sister blew it by not planning ahead. 
912,"Piggybacking on this, even if neither of you want kids (and no unexpected surprises come your way), what if either of you were to fall ill? Would he be angry if you used conventional methods to treat yourself? Would he put his own health at risk to avoid conventional treatment?"

916,"Unfortunately, bigots tend to raise bigots. This would be a dealbreaker for me. My advice would be to have him address this in therapy before moving towards marriage. Be prepared, though. These feelings are usually very deeply rooted and it takes a lot of time to reform someone who carries this much vitriol towards a group of people. "
917,"Tip: Imagine your friends are talking about their parents rather than their kids for a second. Answering ""I have to cook for my mother first before I go out"" with ""Cant she do it herself"" is still pretty rude. Or ""Isnt your father a bit old to be reading that comic book?"" Either way you come off as judgmental on stuff thats straight up not your business. "
918,"Hmm. This is tough not knowing more about the situation. My gut reaction is something is up. I have a friend where this happened- his girlfriend just never brought him around her family and they were together for years. She had a medical emergency and when he called her parents to tell her, they had no idea who he was.  Turns out she had another boyfriend and that's why she never told her parents about him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think his reason is bs- this is life and you gotta talk to people. ""Disturbing the status quo"" is some crap too. There is something fishy going on here, and I would tell him that he needs to explain himself or you're done. "
919,"There is a reason why this 30 year old man is dating someone who is 22 - it's because women his age have the life experience to recognize his sexist selfishness and call him out on it, and they won't put up with this nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

Your schooling IS a job. A full time one. It takes time and effort to succeed, and it's investing in your future. Additionally, if you are contributing equally to expenses, then he isn't providing the income. You are providing the same amount of money, so it's not like you aren't pulling your weight. You are in fact carrying equal financial weight, and the burden of household weight as well. And yet he thinks you aren't doing enough!

920,"I don't understand how this is a ""badly worded joke"".

I ended a relationship over something *very* similar. I am average looking. My ex was average looking. Most people are average looking. Think of all the people you see in a day. How many are stunningly beautiful or stunningly ugly? 1%? Most of us are average. 

On paper my BF was an average, slightly balding, regular middle aged guy. I'm a cute but rather plain middle aged woman. Both solid 5s, maybe 6s with some work. 

But he was attractive TO ME!!!! I loved his eyes. I loved his smile. I loved the sound of his voice and the way he moved. I loved his wit, compassion and intelligence. To ME he was a 10. 

There was a dispute with some friends. I suggested ""Maybe he's starting shit with you because he has a thing for me? I always kind of suspected but then, I wasn't dating anyone. Maybe he can't stand the idea of me with you and that's why he's acting a fool.""

Ex said ""I doubt that's it. You're not going to win any beauty contests. Neither of us are.""

What. The. Actual. Fuck. Did. You. Just. Say??? 

I had *thought* that HE found me attractive. Attractive enough to at least *entertain* the thought that someone else might want me. And no, I'm not a VS Angel..... but I didn't think I was hideous either. I thought some people might find me attractive and others not and at the end of the day there would be a fairly even number in both columns. 

And yes he insulted himself too, but he can think whatever he likes about himself. I could only hear hos statement as him saying ""I think I'm ugly so I settled for an ugly woman that no one else would ever want.""

He apologized. He tried to explain. Friends told me he made a badly worded point but I could NOT move on from it. Every time I tried to be affectionate or sexual with him all I could think of was ""He doesn't believe anyone else could ever want me. He thinks I'm the best he can do but I'm not what he WANTS.""

It was over inside a month.

I don't care what he MEANT. I heard what he SAID off the cuff. It couldn't be taken back. I may not be the most attractive woman on earth. I accept that as a fact. But I need to be attractive TO MY PARTNER. "
921,"&gt; Would it be okay, you think to email her and clear the air?

It stood out to me that when you mentioned you weren’t sexually attracted to women, he affirmed he *only* wants a threesome if it’s him and two girls. If he pushes the issue with you, he’s not only being insensitive, he’s being a hypocrite. "
932,"...and why do you want to be with this person?

""Hey I know we just had a great weekend where I told you it was amazing, one of the best times I ever had in my life, amazing sex, and that I feel more comfortable around you than anyone...""

""Wow that sounds great, I feel the same way! those are all really important things in a healthy relationship!""

""I know, right?? But here's the thing, I'm dumping you because the restaurant could have been nicer. Also I really want a lot of material things, so it's great that you're kind and supportive and make me feel comfortable being myself, but yeah, I want money.""

""But can't we try--""

""-Nah, money.""

""But-""

933,"I agree. Unfortunately, it’s a common dynamic with abusers to show their true selves shortly after marriage.  I believe they begin devaluating their partner once they feel they have them for good. It’s really awful, but happens a lot when red flags before marriage are ignored. OP, please take care of yourself and stay safe. Your husband sounds like a dangerous man. :("
934,I’ll be your girlfriend if you’re just gonna let a girl live there for free and it’s a 3 bedroom. I won’t complain about farts I swear. 
935,Seriously. I had a teacher who was pregnant and by her 3rd trimester she said she had put on a total of 20 pounds during her pregnancy. Her body looked completely unchanged except for her pregnancy belly. 20 pounds is really nothing in terms of pregnancy weight gain.
936,"Yes, this was my biggest response to all of this. You can't just ""assign"" a cat to a person. Even if that person feeds them, brushes them, plays with them, cats are going to pick their preferred peeps. Our cat likes both my husband and I equally overall from what I can tell (as any good ruler, she treats us both fairly) but turns out she likes each of us more at different times. She decides who she wants to hang out with and when, period."
937,"Why are you hoping he decides to move out? Get proactive and tell him he isn't welcome after the lease is up, or else you leave. "
938,What a power play. She has no respect for you. Move on. She's already shopping for your replacement. 
939,"You could easily be in a “honeymoon” period kinda thing with your twin. Happy to be with her again and rekindle a relationship you feel hasn’t been great for a while. Your wife will not have those feelings, and will therefore probably be more level headed about this. 

What she (your wife) is saying is rude, sure, but not hard to understand. Parents, especially new ones, are protective of their kids and she knows a lot about your twin.  I think that if given time, when the child is older, and if your twin keeps getting better and maintains a positive life, your wife will change her mind IN TIME"
940,Thank you for your blunt honesty. I just told him I didn't want to see him anymore unless he has a proper explanation. I don't think he will. So that is that. I wanted to give him the common decency to open up the space to explain himself. But I don't think it will happen at this point. 
941,"Time to move on, she obviously doesn't respect you or your relationship. Don't look back, you dodged a bullet. "
942,"This. I am the other end, the boyfriend that was stationed far away. You change SO MUCH from 18-25, it is more likely you will regret moving and risking your career goal for a relationship. It might feel bad, but it will feel better to be your own person. 

Law school is no joke, it is hard enough on its own, even a local relationship is difficult to maintain due to the amount of work you will be doing. 

"
943,"Your post shows as 82% upvoted. That's average to high. Not sure what you mean by post has been downvoted. You can't expect 100% upvoted, every post gets them."
944,Anyone that CAN wear a cat on their head has mystical kitty powers.
945,"There is one extended weekend he takes with the ""boys"" annually which I support. The others have been staycations."
946,"You can get him to hire a daily maid, you can break up with him, you can move out but still date him, or you can just be unhappy in your home for the rest of your life. People who are okay with their friends peeing on the floor are not people who will suddenly be clean. "
947,"Or perhaps for how many $500 bags he can buy in the future once her parents are done.... good take, OP should be out."
948,"Yea you don't exist as her bf to anyone.  You need to leave her if you have a shred of self respect and dignity. She gets angry with you as a means to deflect. You're falling for it.
Please, please, leave this lying disrespectful person. "
949,"This would be a pretty insignificant amount of weight to gain for most women at your age. Let alone one who went through a pregnancy. Let alone one who is only 2 months post delivery.

I have to wonder if your husband is just an asshole looking for something to bully you about,  or perhaps not as attracted to you as you ever thought."
950,When is the last time *he* got an STI test?
951,"Years ago, my best friend and i met up with another friend to go shopping.

We hadn't spent time with her outside of work before that day, but wanted to start. She seemed cool and funny. We liked her.

I said that i wanted to go to stores A, B and C. My best friend said she wanted to go to B and C as well, and also to D.

We looked at our new friend and asked her which stores she'd like (us all) to go to.

She just looked at us, stunned.

Which was a bit confusing. It wasn't a hard question. 

So we dug a little and it turned out that she only really had one other friend, and OtherFriend had NEVER cared what OurFriend wanted to do, or where she wanted to go.

Every trip she took with that friend, they just did what  OtherFriend wanted, while OurFriend was expected to be grateful for the privilege.

Our showing her a tiny amount of kindness (that we took for granted), forced her to examine the way she'd been treated. To realize that she wanted more.

(She did end up dumping that ""friend"" not much later)

I'm not saying your boyfriend is a terrible person, or that you should dump him immediately.

But if you've spent a large part of your life hiding your needs and desires, trying not to ""be a burden"" or ""ask for too much"", then you might want to think about what your life would look like if you DID ask for the things you want and need. And actually expected the needs to be met.

He's your first long-term relationship. And that's great. But never let yourself forget that any relationship is a test of how much you enjoy being around each other. It's normal and expected that some (most) of your relationships will fail the test.

If that happens, you just take what you learned into your next relationships.

From what you've written, your current relationship isn't working for you. There's things you'd like to experience with him, but he either doesn't realize how important they are to you, or he does realize, but doesn't care.

So take away the uncertainty. Tell him what you're thinking and feeling. Tell him how much these experiences mean to you. See if you can reach a compromise. 

If he actually cares about you, he should be willing to come to the table and talk about it - come up with a plan that makes you both happy.

If he's not willing to change? If he's not happy to consider your feelings and desires when making plans?

Then please leave him. 

Life is too short."
952,"Don't take those questions personally. People will always have something to point out. If you're married, they'll keep asking why you don't have children, if you have one kid they'll ask why you don't want another etc etc. 

Just tell them ""We don't want to."" and change the subject. "
953,"Seriously. My jaw dropped when I realized these were *her* friends saying shit like that. I thought at first she meant that his friends would say it when they met her - that kind of razzing is common in many friend groups. But no, these assholes are meeting him, and then immediately insulting him. Who the fuck acts like that? Even teenage mean girls at least *pretend* to be nice."
954,"That comment was meant to wake you up, not scare you. Stop it OP. Your cousin is not worth knowing. Make some better friends, because she ain't one. "
955,"Pretty sure I saw something similar as well not long ago! 

Edit: yes she did according to post history. When the mom started this nonsense. "
956,"&gt;Wife and I have been together for 1 year. Have 9 week old son. Wife already wants/talks about having a 2nd.

Lot of red flags. She wanted to be pregnant as soon as possible of a man she barely knew? It's like she just wanted to find a random person who could get her pregnant. The fact that she already want a 2nd child knowing your poor financial situation is another red flag. I REALLY feel bad for you man, you have made a huge mistake but you already know it ...

&gt;my entire life I never wanted kids in the first place. I feel like a selfish person stating that but it is true.

You should have said that on your first date with her. Now you're gonna resent her for the rest of your life and the fact that she doesn't want to work and help you will trigger your resentment towards her even more. 
"
957,"She's dropping her version of being on her best behavior because she thinks everything is settled. 

If you marry her, you are going to be working 80 hours a week to pay for a house you will spend very little time in, 2 cars which you will never use 99% of their capability and save next to nothing for retirement. 

Break up with her and figure out what is really important to you in life, and go find someone who values those things as well. "
958,"This is probably an age thing. 6 years doesn't seem like much, but I'm 30 and many people my age have slowed way down with drinking/partying and buy nicer furniture rather than salvaging from the curbside, things like that. To be clear, I am NOT saying you have done anything wrong or embarrassing, you're in your 20s and acting like a normal person your age. He may just be in a slightly different stage of life.

Regardless, you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't accept you as you are when you're not doing anything wrong. You two may be incompatible."
959,"Yes, this is a huge fucking red flag. Fly over Red Square while the Russian army marches red flag.

Eventually, this will turn on you.

Fast forward a year or so, the two of you move in together. You divvy up the chores. You are going to end up living in mortal fear of doing something less than perfect, because anything less will incur her wrath. Once this becomes your new normal, it will pervade every aspect of your life."
960,"Well I’m happy for you that it was sorted out. But I hope you also have taken the criticism about your assumptions and your actions to heart. This could’ve landed you in a lot of trouble, you’re lucky it played out this way."
961,"The problem here isn't your ""jealousy"", or how you feel about your wife's relationship with Gabe. In fact, you're not the problem here at all. Your wife is. She is prioritizing someone else over you, even after you've expressed your discomfort with the situation.

I think a lot of people would feel the same in your shoes. You are not wrong to feel the way you do - I hope you realize that. And kudos to you for being so trusting and trying to communicate and work this out with your wife.

The thing is, your wife doesn't seem to want to compromise or change anything, despite the fact that she is hurting you. That's not a good sign.

I think the best solution would be for both of you to go to couples counseling. Find someone with a good reputation who can act as an unbiased person who will mediate, ask questions, and hopefully help your wife see that what she is doing is not good for her marriage and relationship with you."
962,"ask your gf to sit down with you and play her the audio. then ask her what its about. honesty is the only way to go. there is always the chance she didnt go through with it. you will have to decide what the truth is by her reaction. im sorry this happened, and im sorry you had to find out this way. but someone is looking out for you and now you know part of the truth. get the rest from the gf. "
963,"god dammit let's say it again because this is *important*:

&gt;""When I am entering into a relationship with any man, it's important for me to know that I will never, under any circumstances, need to fear the superior strength that he has due to his testosterone. Any man I sleep with could easily hold me down, rape me, or kill me. I understand that you have never had to fear this from a sex partner, and it's probably a pretty foreign concept to wrap your head around. That's why I'm telling you now that I need you to be aware, any time you put your hands on me, that I can't just throw you off. You need to stop instantly when I tell you, and you need to always make sure you are playing gently, even when you are drinking. This is the only way I can feel safe in your home and in your bed.""
"
964,Thats the thing is that I don't think I could open up him about it again. 
965,"Shave your head now, start talking to her about a prenup, and go to pre-marriage counseling.

It's easy to tell people to throw their relationships away, and harder to actually do it.

If she hates your shaved head, doesn't want to sign a prenup, and is resistant to counseling, then you can walk away knowing it was the right decision and that you tried. 

But maybe she grows to love your shaved head and petting the peachfuzz (my fave) . Maybe she looks at the prenup and realizes your assets are yours and not hers to be entitled to. Maybe discussing finances and wedding goals with a neutral third party helps her recognize her areas of growth. 

Just remember that we all have flaws and there are reasons you love her. Do not marry her with these doubts, but do work to either confirm or disprove the concerns once and for all. But she needs to be willing to recognize her ways and want to change; you can't force her to do anything she doesn't want. 

Good luck. "
966,"&gt;How do I move forward and help her to trust me? How to I fix our marriage?

Dude -**she gave you the answer to that riddle**

&gt;he told me I had to get my act together, come clean to this girl and then cut contact, and allow my wife to go through my phone whenever she wants if I even want a chance of things working out

Do that. How is this even a question? 

Your question sounds more like ""how do I make my wife trust me right away?"" To which the answer is ""Build a time machine, go back in time and not emotionally cheat on your wife""

It's going to take a hell of a lot of time and even then it might not work out.

But this is the bed you made when you emotionally cheated on your wife. Tough man."
967,"That’s also something I “fear”. He has had unfaithful tendencies but only once, and it was at the start of our relationship of only two months. While I’m not justifying it, it has had a big factor in this. "
968,"Your mom sounds like a racist asshole. If your girlfriend is good to you, and you to her, that's all that matters."
969,"Neither of you sounds happy in this relationship.  If you consider yourself straight you will never be happy dating a man.  Break it off, and maybe try to be friends a few years down the road after you’ve both recovered."
970,"Lol. Move on from this asshole. If he wants a servant to run his life, he can find someone to pay to do that shit. Don't build a life with this child. "
971,"It's been said before in many ways, but it bears repeating: love is like a language between two people. When a relationship dies, so does the language. The way which we once expressed ourselves that felt so wholly us, is suddenly gone and we are left to wonder who we are without these expressions.

The truth is, you will learn another language - you will love again. Not only this, but this love will feel right, unlike the previous. Towards the end, your past relationship was no longer comfortable. The language you were speaking no longer expressed who you were. Suddenly, there were things you needed to say, and no words for them in this language of love. This dissolution was inevitable, but just as inevitable is the fact that you will love again. This new person will become your best friend and you guys are going to learn a beautiful new language together.

Edit: Lots of love to whoever guilded this. It's a concept I hold dear."
972,"My SIL is fucking up her kids left and right (imo), but they aren't my kids or my responsibility, so I stay out of it. Parenting styles are so vastly different, and most people are going to be offended if they are told they are doing it wrong. And they will likely double down on what they believe is right, so it probably won't make a difference anyways. I would just not do overnights anymore, but don't start a crusade for the child. Focus on building a positive bond with your nephew independent of his mother, so that he knows he can look to your for help and advice in the future.

All of the above only applies if the parents aren't abusive or neglectful. In that case, family members definitely should advocate for the child."
973,"Thank you! I'm definitely in a better place now (the move made SO much difference) and while it's not a miracle cure, it's made a lot of aspects of my life better now. I know it was a long time ago that I originally posted, but I know I love seeing positive updates of other posts, so I figured I'd share mine :) "
974,"I would suggest she get an Uber, cuz, you know...you might obsess :) but seriously I'm sorry your family sucks. Don't let them ruin your personal growth or achievements. "

976,The fact that your older brother helped you with the essay does not mean it was automatically better (especially in a specific field). You made a lot of assumptions here and took action as though they were facts. 
977,"Speaking from my own experience, I was in a relationship previous that had issues similar to yours - I would be on the wife side of the equation, he would have been on yours.


By the time I was ready to leave him, I was far beyond done. Leaving him was the absolute worst case scenario, and by the time I got there, there was no saving it.


Promises about what would change meant nothing to me, because I reasoned that, if he really valued our relationship, why one earth would he have been totally okay with acting that way towards me right up until the moment the consequences appeared? If he really valued me, why would he not have changed long *before* I was at the point of leaving? If our relationship was worth fighting for, why was he only willing to fight when I was willing to walk away? 


I also had no patience for hearing that he was shocked, absolutely shocked, and had no idea it was coming. We had discussed these major, fundamental problems in the relationship many times. The problems were continuing. *How* could it have been a shock that they ended the relationship? To me, that was just a sign of how he did not take seriously my concerns until he was actually faced with consequences.


None of this is to stay your wife is blameless. Obviously the emotional cheating is playing a huge factor in the relationship's end. And personally I feel that her lie, and the emotional infidelity, is quite a bit worse than lying about smoking. But she's not here, asking for advice, you are, so I can only direct this towards you."
978,"The reply from OP states he said “she just grabbed” his phone and added herself. Yeah the IT guy who doesn’t have a passcode on his smartphone let a 17 year old take it from him and do whatever she wanted, seems likely. /s"
979,"A replacement for something he damaged is not a substitute a gift. It's important to establish your expectations early in the relationship - if acknowledging milestone dates are important, there are these inventions called calendars that everyone can use. He sets a tickler for 2 weeks out so that you don't ""forget"". Is he generally forgetful or only with things that aren't important to him?

On the other hand, a gift card from a convenience store for Christmas is a perfect way to drive home the point."
980,"&gt;He is coming off nicotine pills and in previous times when he has been coming off them has had anger issues and thrown things but never like this. He has never harmed me, not emotionally abusive, usually a great partner.

It's not really out of character.  What he is doing is escalating.  Abusers never start hitting their partners on Date #1.  They sometimes wait years, and slowly escalate over time.  In between episodes, they lovebomb so the victim says ""Oh he's great 99%, it's just the 1% of the time that is super out of character, when he screams and throws things."""
981,"&gt;After his girlfriend storms away, hurt and angry and confused about a cruel nickname (and it is cruel and unflattering, isn't it), he goes drinking with the other person who name calls on her, and spends the night at her house.

His girlfriend is putting up with some shit and tbh I hope she gets out of there asap "
982,It’s not “babysitting” when they’re your own children dude. It’s called “taking care of your kids.”  
983,Pretty much this. OP is awesome 
984,"&gt; The last time I stopped taking it, I ended up in the ER. 

You also vowed to stay together in sickness and in health and it sounds like right now he is being a huge asshole, to be frank. If 30lbs is this much of a problem he is a shit husband. "
