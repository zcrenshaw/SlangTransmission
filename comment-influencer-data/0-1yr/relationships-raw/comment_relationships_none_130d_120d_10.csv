0,"I think... you’re the other woman. 

And honestly, even if you aren’t... this guy doesn’t see a future with you, he doesn’t want you to meet anyone he cares about. 

Literally everything is a red flag, what are you waiting for?"
1,"Something someone I know said to her husband when she was going through something similar -- ""You could die tomorrow, and I'd miss you, but nothing in my life would change."" It really hit home with him that he had so little to do with his kids and his home that he could die and he wouldn't be (logistically) missed.  


Things improved."
2,"I'm in camp let him fail. Even your therapist told you this. Try it.

At work, he has rewards and consequences. He excels.

At home, there's no consequence. You handle it. 

Let him fail already! So there's no pizza for a birthday party. Let everyone see that Dad forgot and then let Dad handle and manage the fall out. Stop doing his laundry. Let him wear his dirty clothes to work. Stop cooking for him. Let him eat sandwiches. Just stop. Don't fix it.

Take care of you. Take care of your girl. It's presumably what you would be doing as a single mom. (Probably a bit easier, honestly. If you don't break this habit now of trying to manage his schedule and responsibilities... Guess who will be managing all the joys and chaos of co-parenting? Divorcing him won't suddenly change who he is there.) 

Be clear to your husband what you're doing and why. That you're at the end of your rope here and you're contemplating divorce. That you need his help in running this family.

If after all that it still doesn't work, ok. You can at least say you tried."
3,"If I were in your shoes I would definitely NOT have this meeting, because she really wants to have this meeting.
It will not go the way you are expecting it to. 
You are calling the meeting to end the drama. **This woman LOVES drama**. You would be giving her all the ammunition she needs to rev it up to another level. 

The only confrontation you should be scheduling should be with your husband."
4,"My wife and I sleep in separate rooms most nights for similar reasons, some things we have found really help maybe some of them will work for you.

Naps.  When time and schedule allow we take naps together.  30 minutes of nap is about all we are aiming for anyway, so if I wake her with my snoring, after that it's okay.

On nights where she can afford a little bit less sleep, she goes to bed with me, and the first time I wake her, she moves to her room.  Less ideal for her, but we get the going to bed together thing.

When our mornings are in sync, sometimes she'll come back to bed so we can wake up together.  

None of those are perfect solutions, but they all are good compromises.  Given the realities of our work schedules and when we need to be awake/asleep they work well enough for us."
5,"He needs to leave this company.

They have repeatedly passed him over for promotions, and when they do finally promote him, they stick him in a bad shift that he did not permanently agree to and cancel a vacation that he was originally promised. 

No matter what else happens, he needs to leave and grow a spine. Work somewhere where they don't treat him worse than dirt."
6,"Advice? Dump him. 

He’s just told you that he doesn’t like spending time with you, he doesn’t like having sex with you and he doesn’t like decisions you’ve made about your life. 

If he’s telling the truth, then there is no future for the two of you. If he’s just saying this as part of some emotional manipulation then he’s not worth staying with."
7,"Where is your husband in all of this? They’re his parents, so he should be the one dealing with the problems they’re causing. “Mom, Dad, I’m not sure if there was a miscommunication, but Wife is not looking for jobs right now, as she is the primary caregiver for our baby. Could you please stop sending her job listings?” Second time: “Mom, Dad, we already discussed that Wife is not looking for a job. Why are you sending her job listings?” And information diet."
8,"I am alternate universe you, and this might get long.

When my daughter was 3 months old her brother tried to help me by putting her up on the couch, which she promptly rolled off of, hit her head, and began vomiting profusely. We rushed to the ER, where we were given the same news.

I got married at 22 to a man in the military, who deployed for the first time 4 months after our wedding. He also deployed 30 days after our daughter was born and I did the infant year by myself with a preschooler on top of it. 

My husband misses all the ER visits. The split open forehead when the preschooler smacked his head on the windowsill break dancing in the living room. The 104 fever. The 4th day of a stomach bug and the kid can't keep down water. The HUGE splinter that got infected so bad it needed surgery. It's always when he's gone.

So. Hopefully by now you see how thoroughly I get your situation. 

Now I want you to imagine, REALLY imagine, what it would be like if you had a partner. Not a ""wonderful dad"" (that's about the kids) or a ""hard worker"" (that's about his boss), but a *partner* (that's about YOU). Think about you for a minute. Not what he does or is for other people. You matter here. 

Imagine if, when something scary and difficult happens with your kids, you could tell him about it and get support. ""Oh my God babe that's so scary. You must be exhausted and frazzled. Thank you for handling that so well."" Really close your eyes and imagine a partner saying those words to you in the hard moments. You deserve that. You matter here. 

Imagine if you had a *partner* who didn't try to hurt you in arguments. The best thing about a relationship is being with a person who knows all of your deepest darkest buttons and you trust them 100% not to touch them. Your husband seeks them out on purpose. He's not just ""not supportive"" he's actively harmful. Remember, being a good dad is his relationship with his kids, and being a hard worker is his relationship with his boss. Your marriage, the support you give one another (or don't), the trust and bond between you, that's his relationship with you. Imagine if that bond helped your life instead of hindered it. And then remind yourself you deserve that. 

Please PM me if you ever need to talk. Military life spends 90% of it's time sending you the signal you don't matter. To survive it you HAVE to know you matter, and you have to have a partner who builds you up. This lifestyle (16 years of it for me so far) is not survivable without that."
9,"Worse would be if she said ""You could die tomorrow, and I'd miss you, but I'd have less work to do than I do today."""
10,"Change your password, password protect all your sites and apps, and don't leave your laptop somewhere where your stepmom can access it without you. 

No, if someone got you a gift, the gift is yours, not theirs. It really isn't a gift if someone else claims ownership of it."
11,"I don't normally jump to cheating, but why is this ""quasi"" infidelity? She abandoned you at a party without so much as a text, which is disrespectful (and not very safe). Then, she rocks up 5 HOURS later and just starts getting ready for bed? Is there a reason you're just sitting there watching her put her brush her teeth and put on her pjs? If my SO left me at a party with someone they were flirting with, I had to track them down, got a weird response and they showed up FIVE HOURS later?? It would not be just getting ready for bed. 

And then she deleted messages? And lied?  Nah, you are underreacting big time IMO."
12,"What you call ""intellectual cheating"" I would call having a friend.

I'd like to challenge the popular idea that you and your partner need to have totally overlapping interests and satisfy every one of each other's needs, because those just aren't realistic expectations. The fact that you share more interests with this guy at work isn't by itself a death knell for your relationship (nor is it a guarantee that you'd make a better couple than you and your boyfriend).

That said, if this friendship has thrown a light on the fact that your relationship with your boyfriend is lacking in other ways, that's worth addressing. Ask your boyfriend whether he has similar concerns. Find ways to troubleshoot the gaps where your interests don't converge, maybe by finding some new hobbies and interests to explore together."
13,"You don’t work together? Cancel this meeting. There is no reason to meet. It does not matter what she is saying about you - people know. They feel uncomfortable when she complains and they just want her to stop. Unless everyone else in this field are teenagers, they know exactly what is going on. Hashing it out with her will not do any good. She’s not going to damage your reputation with her waahhwaaah the woman who’s husband I want to fuck won’t be my friend!!!
Cancel this meeting. Continue to ignore her. 
Your husband is enjoying this and is feeding you info because it meets some need of his."
14,"Before you dump him, make your feelings known.  Not in a nagging sort of way, but sit him down; tell him what you told us, that you understand (to some extent) why and that he’s helping her out, but that the two of you are in a relationship, meaning you should be each other’s priority. And if he feels so beholden to her, it just doesn’t seem the right time for him to be in a relationship with you. 

Don’t make it an ultimatum, don’t make it a “it’s me or her” thing where you may sound jealous of her. Just let him know that you’re setting your own personal boundaries and standards: and that if he can’t meet them, you’re walking away. Unfortunately, you’ll have to be willing to really walk away then. But I think it’s the best approach, because you’re just setting your standard of what you do and don’t accept, and you have every right to walk away if he doesn’t meet them."
15,"There was a post here a couple of months ago from a man whose wife filed for divorce for pretty much this reason only that had been married much longer and had two or three kids.   He was posting because after counseling and self-reflection, he really wanted back with his wife and was asking for tips about their first date after a one-year separation.

Don't wait another 10+ years to join the ranks of walkaway wives.  Stand up for yourself now.   He'll either see the light and change on his own or you'll be free to find someone who wants to be an actual adult partner in the marriage."
16,"But OP is right, when things fail she has to deal with the fallout.

Right now he's promised to go to counselling, and hasn't. Has he failed? Yes. Who is paying the price? Certainly not him. It's clear he won't go unless OP does something.

Sometimes letting him fail means nothing except that OP has to live with the problems it creates.

However, the rest is good. Stop doing laundry, stop cooking. Make sure there aren't leftovers left over for him to cheat and eat off of. Other things just don't work: see, car oil change, individual counselling, even the pizza (kids pick up on parents dynamic and often expect the more responsible parent to do things, I would think they'd get upset with OP for letting ""no pizza"" happen.) Also when stuff gets dirty in the house (cleaning should be his job too) usually the person who is doing all the cleaning just has to fix it, and the person avoiding cleaning literally does not care and never changes.

There are some things OP can try but I guess I just want to comment and make sure she knows: you've already tried. It's okay if you don't want to continue anymore. You have tried so incredibly hard. Whatever you want to do now is up to you. It might be good to issue an ultimatum: you can't live like this. But whatever you choose, divorce or staying, you have already gone above and beyond to try to change the dynamic and if you leave now, it is okay."
17,"&gt;My husband just is not big into keeping in touch.

And now you're finding out why."
18,"You know? Maybe that's what's at the root of this. 

Like ..... why is this ok with HIM? I mean I know it's not. But fuck me we *made it* on our combined wages for 2 years. Skinny sometimes, but we made it. Take the fucking lower paying job at the other company. We can do it again. 

It kinda feels like he's putting being treated like crap ahead of our relationship. Like..... I know he wants to pay off his cards and that's important and I admire it. But maybe we could get small second jobs and put that towards it. Drive Uber or something. Idk."
19,"&gt;Is what I'm going through in any way normal?

Going against the grain here, but yes this is incredibly normal. 

FOMO (fear of missing out), grass is always greener, and avoidant dismissive attitudes towards a partner who gets too emotionally close are absurdly common patterns of behavior to the point of being cliche OP! 

We don't have enough INFO, but I personally don't think breaking up is the immediate position to take. 

This is one of those moments you really should introspect, look inward at past behavior, and ask yourself what the root cause for your unease right now is. If you specifically don't like your GF, by all means breakup. Now that the honeymoon period is over, maybe you're seeing her for *her* and not liking what you've seen. However, if you routinely do this, get attached to a partner and then drop them like they suck after the honeymoon period, congratulations, you're self-sabotaging yourself."
20,"Honestly this is the perfect advice.
They're right you have to let him fail. If he has one job and fails at it then let him explain it, don't be snarky if it is a public fail. It does seem like he isn't seeing you as a priority. My mom always said don't let yourself become the couch. No one pays attention to the couch, you expect the couch to be there after a long day. But wtf do you do when you come home and go to sit down and the couch  is gone!? Don't let him not appreciate you until you are gone. He is clearly capable. Take your name off the credit cards he has, make him go run and get the pizza one he explains to everyone how he failed at his only job, stop babying him and let him fall hard and don't offer to pick up any of the pieces. DON'T LET HIM MAKE YOU THE COUCH!"
21,"There are two ways to handle disparate income levels -- either live at the level of the lower earning partner, or use a proportional division of  income.

&gt;Right now, over 50% of my income gets put toward rent.

That is not sustainable.   If you are paying over 35% of net income, you are paying too much.  Tell him you can't afford to live with him in your current place ....and mean it

&gt;Recently, without knowing, I shorted him on our 50/50 grocery payment by maybe $10. He kind of threw it in my face during an argument.

​First of all, I'm not sure how that came about.  The best way to handle expenses is from a joint account to which you are both contributing.  Use a debit card from that account for all expenses that cannot be paid through transfers.  

Secondly, if he's going to go off about a $10, unintentional discrepancy and use it in further arguments, you will have a very hard time getting on a common financial page, let alone become actual financial partners.

&gt;I don’t want to break up with him, but sometimes it’s so tempting knowing that if I walked away from this, I could pay off ALL of my debt within 1.5 years and actually start thriving again.

What exactly is your end-game though? Money issues are the second most common factor in divorces, and now you know why.   If you can't talk to him about this now, you are just putting off a bigger argument.   If you don't think he'd be amenable to a fairer division of ongoing expenses, I'd suggest that you move somewhere you can afford and work on your personal finances.  You don't necessarily have to break up with him but it's time to prioritize your own financial well-being."
22,Is there any chance he’s hiding you? This isn’t normal.
23,"Cancel the meeting with her and schedule a meeting with a marriage counselor. How long are you going to agree to let your husband drag you through the mud by allowing others to insult you professionally and emotionally? He needs to understand this isn't a little issue that harms no one of he allows this woman to continue. Seeing this woman will only add fuel to the fire, not put it out."
24,Nothing. Your husband should be the one who should be putting up boundaries with her and shutting her down. He must really enjoy the attention and not be prioritizing you if he’s doing nothing about her behavior.
25,"So he drives drunk, doesn’t want to talk to you, doesn’t enjoy sex with you and wants you to do things that make you uncomfortable solely to please him. Remind me why you’re still together?"
26,"I’m really sorry but this sounds like you’re the side chick. I hope I’m wrong :(

I think that some counselling is in order as to why you “won’t tolerate secrets” in a relationship, yet have been doing so *for a year and a half*. And you’re the secret. 

Given that your previous relationship was like this as well, I’d have a deeper look at your family - was someone in your family a secret maker, or someone who kept things hidden ? Because it sounds like you’re consciously or unconsciously repeating an old pattern here, and it’s not serving you well. 

I would suggest telling your BF that you want to meet his friends, all of them, in the next month. I’m willing to bet that he will refuse, and if you push it he will dump you. Probably on the grounds that its your fault for being “controlling”. 

I would be loathe to go into another relationship without unpacking this pattern, and without learning how to set and enforce boundaries with a competant and compassionate therapist."
27,"It isn’t a shared account if you can’t access it. It’s her account you put money in. I really can’t even think of a devil’s advocate argument to support her position, especially since it was her idea to begin with."
28,When I started to read this I assumed these friends we’re all local ones that you saw often but then I got to the part where you said they’re from out of town and you never see them. Are you really that surprised that you got a lot declines?  Why didn’t you invite local friends that you see on a regular basis?
29,Are you sure he isn’t twisting shit on purpose? Abusive people like to alienate their victims. Maybe he’s implying something she never said because he doesn’t want her to be close with anyone. Do you think he’s trying to ruin your friendship?
30,"On one hand: ooooh boy, that sucks and is embarrassing! Kinda makes it seem like he’s not very particular?

On the other: you always find what you’re looking for in the last place you look. If things work out between you two you would be the last girl he asked out anyway!

Guess you have to decide if he’s worth overlooking his indiscriminate past!"
31,"It feels like you kinda need to say this to him.

Because I can see a scenario where he’s thinking “yes it crappy right now but me and OP are in it together, I just need xxx time to it off cards/get reasonable experience and I’m done”.

Meanwhile you are (validly I think) in “it’s just not worth this shit territory”.

If he knows where you are at right now, maybe he’ll re - evaluate his approach. Sometimes you need a kick from your Bf/ gf to make you prioritise and realise what is more important. This isn’t an ultimatum, just honesty about what you need from the relationship if it’s going to continue"
32,"He’s hiding you. 

You said in your post that secrets are a deal-breaker. Your man is nothing but secrets, and it seems that he has been very clear that nothing is going to change. You won’t meet his friends and they likely know nothing of you. How will you build a life with someone who doesn’t seem to want to include you in theirs?"
33,"Hey- just offering a word of hope- I absolutely HATED my dad when I was your kid's age. We butted heads about everything, I felt like I couldn't talk to him. A few things changed that. The main one was moving out. That eliminated 90% of the problems right there, because our frustrations were no longer all day every day and he didn't feel he had to ""parent"" me any more.

But before that, there were two different days. One day he took me to the hardware store and told me how a water heater worked. He was clearly so excited to be able to impart that knowledge to me, and it made me realize how much my grouchy, impervious father cared for me.

The most important day he asked me to go for a walk. I grounded about it but eventually joined him. He started to open up as we walked. He told me things I never knew, like how depressed he was when his father died. And how he was afraid of losing me. How scared he was that I'd turn out just like him and have a hard life. Stuff I never expected to hear from him. And in turn, I opened up too. We would still butt heads after that, but there was a foundation of love and understanding there.

Nowadays I'm in my 30s and married. I have a house and dogs and cats and I'm going back to school. But I still stop by and see my dad. He still doesn't say much about his feelings. He's still grumpy. But I show him my art and tell him funny stories about the dogs. And I text him. He's just learned to use emojis!

I know that was a lot of rambling. But please take from it this: tell your kid how much you love him. How you're proud of him. How you are so sad about the distance between you.

Be vulnerable."
34,"Go to college!  Your dad will pay, and if you take out loans now, you at least wouldn't be struggling.  You would currently qualify as an independent student because you are older than 24, which means your parental income can't be counted when assessing need-based aid.  You can get grants to go to school and may have minimal loans.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ulterior motive?  Yes, he wants you to stay the same.  You're allowed to grow, even if that means you leave him behind.  Not because he is unemployed or doesn't have a degree, but because he doesn't support you.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure there is a not nice way to communicate that you're going to do what's best for you.  If he interprets that negatively, dump him.  Don't beg him to understand.  Move home if you have to since your dad sounds supportive."
35,"Yes this is a dumpster fire. She should not be meeting with this woman at all. It is only going to hurt her and give the women ammo to use against her. The woman thrives on drama and will likely say outlandish things to get a reaction then report back to people while conveniently leaving out her part. 

Good rule of thumb. Don’t confront other women to try to get your husband to behave. She owes you nothing. She wants to hurt you. You can’t make her get your husband to be supportive or a good partner."
36,"&gt;Is my fiancée setting up uncomfortable scenarios on purpose to upset me?   
&gt;  
&gt;he had texted his female coworker before we had went to dinner. He wanted to make me mad by him hugging her. She didn’t want to. 

I mean...you've sort of answered your own question there. As the saying goes, ""Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is an enemy action."" You've listed **five** incidents. Start calling him out, start enforcing boundaries, or tell him you're done being so disrespected and leave."
37,"You both sound like very sensitive people who have both been through *a lot*.  It sounds like her admission triggered a self-esteem spiral for you, since you mention ""she deserves better.""  I wonder how much of your crying had to do with *guilt about feeling not good enough*.  She trusts you enough to tell you about her past, so clearly you are, in her perception, good enough.  I think there is sadness that you weren't in her life *sooner*.  That is something you're both within your rational minds to grieve over.  She probably has similar feelings about regretting things you went through.  You didn't know what to say or how to react when she told you, so it sounds like you are thoughtful and have a gentle and non-judgemental baseline.  I suggest focusing on the qualities you appreciate about each other, so shadows from your pasts don't distort your present and future.  I also suggest thinking of it as if your partner told you she was abused (not the same, but as a frame shifter); don't fixate, don't pry, *don't imagine* (think of it as the clients getting a karmic commission each time you acknowledge their existence), and don't beat yourself up over it.  Make your own memories together and steer clear of thoughts of exes/clients/whatever."
38,"When my husband got deployed to Iraq for 14 months everyone lamented that it was just me at home with the four children and the six dogs and 2 cats, having to do everything all by myself. I looked at everyone quizzically and said, ""Yes? I've always done everything all by myself. The only difference now is I have less laundry to do..."" Things did not improve. He's my ex."
39,"Do you want any of these ""things""? It sounds like it's not worth it, and that's valid.

Because ""Please throw the things out or recycle them. I do not want them. Do not show up at my place of work. Stop texting me."" is a completely sufficient 

Then calmly book some time, and tell your boss that your abusive mother is threatening to show up at your place of work. Tell your boss that you have told her not too, and that it is inappropriate. Discuss next best steps with them if she does show up, and how the staff can be prepared to handle her in the same way they might handle any other abusive, non-customer. Up to and including, calling the police to remove a trespasser. 

I know it's scary, but the best way you set yourself up for success with your boss is to tell them straight up ""I'm doing everything I can here, but I'm a victim of an abuser. And if my abuser shows up at work, I may need some additional support."" 

I had a stalking ex boyfriend for a few years, and the best advice I got was to just be honest with my boss and my dean at university. Both were very respectful and took steps to make sure that security would respond if my stalker showed up. I hope you're met with the same respect. I do think you probably will be. Most people get it. Sometimes abusers just abuse, and there is nothing to do but get ready for the worst, and ask those around you to be supportive."
40,Your instincts are trying to tell you something. Listen to them.
41,"What size is your bed? I am a light sleeper, too. I wake super easily. I slept with someone on a huge California King with a memory foam mattress topper and I didn't notice when they tossed or turned or moved. This was the first time ever - I really hate having sleepovers with my bf because I am guaranteed to get a shitty night's sleep (I have a queen sized bed), but if we get more serious I'll definitely get a bigger bed."
42,"I don’t think other woman, just one of many women."
43,"You are not selfish. Your family manipulated the shit out of you. Your brother and father *could* have helped your mother, but they decided it was ""women's work"" and left it all to you. Your mother could have gotten help from all her friends, but instead all she did was make them shame and guilt and manipulate you into giving up your life and your freedom to be her unpaid slave. 

You have *every right* to be angry. You have *every right* to start planning how to get back out of your parent's house. Yes, it may take two years. But how old will you be in two years if you *don't* make plans to move out?

The key here is to *not tell* your parents, your brother, or any of their friends, or your other relatives what you are planning. They've already manipulated you once. It's very likely they'll sabotage your efforts to move away again, so they can keep you around as an unpaid slave.  

Look up the Captain Awkward letter #110, ""How do I claw my way out of this depressing living situation?"" It will have some good advice for you, and how to plan long-term.

I would also advice reading up on how to set and enforce boundaries. Check out the Setting Boundaries Workbook by Sharon Martin, or a similar book. Guilt and shame only work if *you allow them to*. Learn how to stop letting your parents pull your strings. 

Therapy, also, if you can afford it, and if you can *keep it a secret* from your family. They won't want you to go, because of the fear (the correct fear) that therapy will teach you that you are a worthwhile person who has valid needs (which you *are*) and that how your family treats you is not okay (which it *isn't*)."
44,"Ah! The cry of the pathetic adult-child who wants out of the relationship, but doesn't want to look like a douche by initiating the break up, so he's just handed you a list of (almost impossible) demands. For him? This is a win-win scenario. If you comply and manage it, he'll have someone who is willing to change every fibre of their being to be with him, so he can heap ever more ridiculous requests on your head. This will never stop. Even if you achieve all this, it won't be enough, so next it will be threesomes (even if you're straight and don't want one) or an open relationship, or a break where you are expected to continue to keep house and faith while he screws around and reverts to a teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, if you fail, he can keep telling you how unreasonable you are, how much he does for you, how he asks so little.

Or you break up with him, in which case, win! He doesn't have to do any of the work and can play the heartbroken suitor.

Do you get the impression your boyfriend is a pathetic smear of shit on the shoe of 'What's Acceptable'? Because he is.

Let's look this in the eye - if these issues were such dealbreakers, why did he date you in the first place? If they're so awful, why is he still with you now? Answer: They weren't and they aren't, you are awesome for knowing yourself and being comfortable in yourself, but he is dissatisfied with himself and rather than change that, he'd rather project that onto you and tear you down.

Here's a hint: That doesn't fix the root cause. So this will never stop. You will never change enough that it fixes something in him and make him happy. He will keep tearing you down into smaller and smaller pieces to fit you into a box you were always far too grand to fit into.

Does it sound like love to you? It's not. And you're here because you know it's not, but you've been together for years and that your partner loves and wants the best for you is one of your core beliefs of those years - as anyone should feel about their partner - and you've got two pieces of information in front of you. One is the reality of his behaviour (change, you aren't good enough, I don't like you as you are) and the other is what he's telling you is the core of his behaviour (I love you, I want you to be your best self, I enjoy your presence in my life and want to keep it). The two are mutually exclusive. You can't have both. You'd reject one if you could....

....but you can't. And you shouldn't. Please don't. You are better than that.

It's not because he loves you. Not in any meaningful way. He loves you the same way he pays his taxes; because it's needed for him to have a comfortable life. You are more than someone's tax form, and you should not have to change every part of yourself to bring him joy when there are millions of people out there (literally, even if only 1 in a million people would find you attractive and rejoice at being with you, that's still over \*7 million people\* on this earth) who would throw you a party just for being you.   


You can see what this is. You knew it already, you just came here for confirmation.  


Leave him - he can go find all the blonde, 20-20 visioned, heeled, brightly coloured immaculately coiffed feminine unperfumed women he wants. Maybe he'll find one who'll put up with this bullshit, but right now, I'd say that dating pond scum is too good for him. You, meanwhile, should go on being your amazing self, without the 180-odd lbs of loser trying to fix what isn't broken. Trust me - you're going to be fine."
45,"is it possible he's asking because he's concerned about you? dropping hobbies and other things that make you happy can be a warning sign.

if my wife suddenly showed no interest in any of her hobbits I'd start worrying about her"
46,I’ve honestly wondered that. Because he wouldn’t really post anything about us on Facebook and wouldn’t allow the post that I’ve tagged him in to show on his timeline. Which I know that Facebook isn’t that big of a deal....but........
47,"So, what are the odds that this guy already has a girlfriend, it just isn't you? All of this is extremely weird and off-putting, I don't know how you've lasted 18 months. Don't settle for this."
48,"Talk to your wife and tell her this isn't sustainable anymore. You know it's her best friend, but you cannot work and take care of a baby at the same time. Explain how she abandoned the baby on the doorstep. Ask your wife to tell her the arrangement is over, and that if the baby is abandoned on the door step again, you will be calling the authorities.

You should also talk to your wife about how it is completely unfair for her to volunteer you for such a major undertaking without your express permission, forcing you to be the bad guy."
49,I second this. This definitely sounds other woman-y.
50,Tell your mom. You shouldn't have to be in that situation.
51,"Dude, he sounds awful and entitled and you'd be awful and entitled to stick your roommates with him."
52,"Those colleagues are being pretty cruel.  We had a ""Dan"" as well who asked out a bunch of the girls in our group and elsewhere - yes we joked between ourselves that it was a bit awkward and desperate but we NEVER said it to his face, and when he DID get a proper girlfriend we would have died before ever mentioning it to her.  We strictly toed the party line of bigging Dan up to anyone who didn't already know about who he had approached.  And we were only about 18 at the time."
53,"Time, unfortunately that is the answer. It’s okay not to cry.  Everyone reacts differently. You will be okay, just be there for your family."
54,"You find out he is having  inappropriate conversations with other women, and somehow he has turned this around and made it your fault. Manipulative. Red flag #1. 

He has given you an actual *list* of things to change about yourself. Lack of empathy and compassion. The list is so long and detailed it basically sounds like he wants you to be someone else. Red flags #2 and 3.

In an unsurprisingly turn of hypocrisy/irony, he doesn't hold himself to the same standards of physical attractiveness and in fact is himself the direct antithesis of conventional male attractiveness. Double standards. Red flag #4."
55,"They seem to be co-dependent and you are low priority for him.   I'm sure these are not the only examples you have of times that he made it clear she was more important to him.

End this charade now and tell him exactly why."
56,"She's moving in with ELEVEN animals?? Im a dog lover but there's a line and that is wayyy beyond. Holy shit. Honestly it sounds like she's his only priority and you're the other woman. He doesn't do shit for your birthday and he's ditching you on mother's day, what a jerk. How much further down the priority list will you be once she's living in his house?

You're absolutely not being petty and none if this is ok or normal. Your feelings are valid. You should always trust your feelings. Its ok to want to be your boyfriend's priority, you're his girlfriend! How much longer are you going to accept being treated like an afterthought? Because you deserve better."
57,"You are an adult. If they gave you money as a gift, you don’t need to pay it back. Keep your appt with the therapist."
58,"Ok, so I'm an atheist but i feel like I gotta add that the people you were around were toxic. Not a representation of the religion itself. 

If you feel that you have a strong connection faith, seek out that connection. If not ignore religion. Either way, take a break and think about yourself and what faith means to you. If it's for social connection, that's fine and you should follow that. If it's seeking a higher purpose in life, that's fine and follow that. 

Each person finds their own following in life and it sounds like you need to find yours (even it's it's you that you're following). 

Good luck."
59,"I think meeting her is a mistake, but since it's happening keep it as professional as possible. You don't want to give her ammo for more rumours.

You have a problem in your marriage, placing the blame outwards will not solve the issue. If your husband was a decent partner there would be no problem. Put your energy into finding a relationship councillor."
60,"He has another girlfriend and his friends know about her, which is why nobody will ever know about you. This exact thing happened to me but 2 months in I found out and left."
61,She’s your friend. I’m pretty sure your weight doesn’t bother her. Just be honest with her.
62,"&gt; just me at home with the four children and six dogs and 2 cats

I had an anxiety attack just reading that."
63,You're right - she should respect your privacy and you communicated that to her. She had no right to put her fingerprint in your phone without asking. Now she's acting immature by giving you the silent treatment for removing the very fingerprint she had no right adding.
64,What’s stopping you from just saying to her what you said here? If she says no then just walk away.
65,"You have permission to break up with your SO whenever you want, for whatever reason. But does he know how close you are to breaking up with him over this? Does he know you're serious about not wanting to live like this? If not it might be worth letting him know the gravity of the situation."
66,"This is an amazing story. It is clear how much you both love each other. But sometimes things don't work out. It is very painful but all you can do is be grateful for your time together and start to heal. As someone who has gone through something similar, I know how it is likely one of the hardest things you have ever gone through. But you will both be happier for it one day, even if you can't see it right now. Best of luck in your healing journey."
67,"&gt;He procrastinates keeping in touch with family, as well as his friends. Even his grandma, who he thinks is the bomb diggity, he puts off calling her for weeks, even with my insistence that he should give her a call.

I am this husband. Nevertheless, I tackle family interference fairly head-on. I've learned how to put the kibosh on rebuttals, and state how we operate in no uncertain terms. My mother took issue with the fact that we were getting a prenup when we got married. My wife's family is wealthy, and she has a more lucrative career than I do. Her parents split and the divorce consisted largely of monetary bickering. All the prenup says is that I don't want anything of hers, she doesn't want anything of mine, and we want to split everything we share.

My mother got that explanation once. When she pushed harder, I told her that this was between me and my wife, and we would do what we felt was right. She invited me to coffee - she drove - and insisted on having the conversation again. I doubt she expected it to end with me telling her that I don't care what she thinks, I'm going to do what's best for me and my wife and she's going to have to deal with the fact that my wife and I are our own family unit now.

Defending your spouse to/from your parents is part of the job of being a spouse. You can procrastinate with your own stuff, but you're the Watcher on the Wall when it comes to your family stepping to your spouse. Your guy needs to step up here and set the expectations."
68,"The fact that he threw that very small sum from your grocery bill in your face says a lot of negative things about this guy. Honestly, he’s using you to subsidize his lifestyle. If you split expenses proportionally (which would be the proper thing to do) he would have a little less than he does now, and he clearly doesn’t want that. 

&gt; if I walked away from this, I could pay off ALL of my debt within 1.5 years and actually start thriving again.

Honestly, this is more valuable than a selfish partner who picks a fight over ten dollars. I think you should suggest splitting expenses proportionally. If he doesn’t go for it, then walk."
69,"Thank you for this, for thinking about the situation and not just telling me to break up with her.

I am glad to hear that those things are all normal. Reddit and particularly this sub can be so dismissive that it can sometimes make you feel like a weirdo. 

I have no issue with her genes. I will gladly have children with her not least because she is a very kind person. She is also very pretty.

I think the issue is purely within me. I think a part of me is desperate for validation, for recognition and for friends as a lot of my friendships have faded over the last few years. I wonder if I am just getting my wires crossed when I make friends with pretty girls.

Thank you so much for your response. I definitely need to do a lot of self-reflection and to figure things out personally, so I can give my SO everything she deserves, which I am not doing right now."
70,She doesn't understand password security so she won't understand your point of view. But she's wrong and you're right.
71,"He had no reaction. I asked several weeks before the party, he did some research and said “going with a chain will be the cheapest.” Then the Friday before the party, I just did it myself. Found a local pizza place for HALF the cost of the chains nearby. Then, I arranged pick up with my dad I didn’t even bring it up until yesterday, almost 2 weeks later. I’m running out of fight and feel like I don’t even advocate for myself anymore. Just writing this making me very sad."
72,"I'm the one who does the primary communicating with family. Even his family. When we were out of state, I was the one always sending baby updates and pictures. Right now I'm the one who talks to them, set up times to get together at the park or go have dinner with everyone. My husband just is not big into keeping in touch. Whereas I, especially since having our kid, am big into our kid having as much family around him as possible (I didn't have much family growing up)

They don't even bother messaging or calling him anymore to see how things are going, because they know I'm more likely to respond they will contact me. So I'd feel like I'm hiding behind him if he suddenly contacts them to tell them to leave me be. If that makes sense."
73,"You cannot wait around waiting for someone to change. You have spent 10 years of your life with this guy, you should know by now that your goals are different and he's not going to marry you,  especially after this.  The way I see it you have two options.

One, accept the fact that you are never going to be married to this man, and continue your lives together. If that's something you are ok with and won't regret then you could probably work it out. 

Two, if marriage is a deal breaker for you,  break up with him,  and move on. You can not waste your life waiting and hoping that someone is going to change for you. That will set you up for resentment amongst other issues. I can't stress this enough you SHOULD NOT waste your life waiting and hoping that someone else will change for you. 

I'm sorry OP. What he did was not kind, he should have been honest to you from the get go. What happens with your life depends on you.  If he makes you happy and you can accept your differences,  then you can make it work.  If not, you need to stop wasting your time and move on. I hope you get peace whatever you choose."
74,"QUESTION:  ""What do you have to hide from us?""

75,"Another point I just thought of: he’s a good dude if he was able to ask these women out, get rejected, and take it on the chin without losing the friendships."
76,"Your family is paying for you to go, not her. There's no reason for your GF to be at the graduation. If you refuse to go because of your GF your family will be really hurt and you'll really dumb *when* this blows up in your face.. which is will. She just stonewall's you and refused to talk about things? That's not even remotely healthy behavior. It's very toxic, and your family sees this."
77,"&gt; I don’t even know why you’re on this subreddit asking for advice when the entire situation is black and white.

Really? 

You can't think of even one reason why?

There are many.

Because it's not always so black and white to the people in the middle of it. 

Because sometimes people don't have the experience to know what is healthy.

Because sometimes you need support.

Because sometimes you need validation.

Because any single reason why. It doesn't matter why. 

What matters is that OP posted asking for help when something felt wrong. She reached out to a community of supportive people. 

Why do you feel the need to judge her for that? Why do you feel the need to be one more shitty person when you have every opportunity to be better than that?"
78,"He knows you're unhappy, not ""I'm unsure what that means"" is very different from ""I can't do this anymore."" Make it that clear."
79,Good point... either way you look at it it's bad news.
80,"The way that she's treating her depression is not working and she should consider alternatives- a different therapist, CBT, medication, etc. That is the root cause of everything- her lack of ambition, her inability to do housework or change jobs, be romantic, etc.

Tell her that if she isn't willing to start seeking out some real fixes to her clinical depression that you can't stay with her. Everything about this relationship sounds horrible."
81,Why are you enabling your cousin if you don't support him and his actions? Stop giving your cousin a place to live if he's a shithead who can't even respect you and the home you provide him. Stop playing mediator here. This isn't your problem to figure out and you have your own shit to deal with.
82,"Good for you for calling 911 and extra help. That was the EXACT right thing to do when somebody threatens suicide.

Either your wife really needed help, or she needed a wake up call that suicide threats are not okay. Whichever it was, you did the right thing by calling the authorities.

If she's angry, that's on her. You did not do anything wrong and you should not apologize for doing the exact correct thing that you do when somebody threatens suicide.

Go home. Stand your ground. Tell her that you love her and will call 911 every single time she tells you she's going to kill herself."
83,"&gt; May not be the update I wanted to share but it is my reality now. 

Hey, you did what's best for you (and your kids by not leaving them with some strangers)! 

Sometimes what's best for us isn't what we ever imagined, or expected, but that's okay :) 

Sending you well wishes"
84,"Girl let me tell you something.

He won't change. Guys like him don't.

You should not have to apologize or feel bad for not being a certain way in the bedroom, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being more conservative. You are worth so much more than that half assed excuse of a man. Not all men are Pigs like that, mostly they're decent and respectful towards women, find you one of those and live happily ever after."
85,"If someone isn't ""fuck yes!"" towards the idea of being official with you, then you shouldn't be either."
86,"&gt;My husband is a homebody and I am constantly telling him to go out and invite Mary out so that they can continue their friendship.

Well, stop that. Mary clearly feels possessive of your husband and resents your position in his life. She's going to feel that way even if you cure cancer and rescue puppies from burning buildings in your spare time. If nothing you do is good enough for her, nothing's exactly what you should give her. 

Maybe the way he wants to handle it is to slow fade her, and maybe you should let him. If she decides to kick off about it, *then* you can have conversations with your husband about handling her more directly. (Edit: I agree that it would be ideal if he told her to stuff it, but if the end goal is ""no more bullshit from Mary,"" fading her out is one way to accomplish that.)"
87,"He procrastinates keeping in touch with family, as well as his friends. Even his grandma, who he thinks is the bomb diggity, he puts off calling her for weeks, even with my insistence that he should give her a call. 

But as for his parents, there's some strain there with his relationship with them. He used to have a lot of problems, drug and alcohol related. They seem to have a hard time accepting that he isn't the same person and he hates the way they look at him.

And now I'm realizing that if they still see him that way, they are probably looking at me in a similar light just by association."
88,"She is worried if she directly confronted him he would hit / lash out at her or you. 

Ignore this really and help her gtfo."
89,"I think you’ve got it OP. Most of the time that we are attracted to another person, it isn’t something about them we are attracted to, it is the positive way we feel about ourselves in their presence, but we project it onto them. So there is some need, desire and drive within you to chase that feeling that you want to feel within you. It has nothing to do with these attractive women, you want to feel that satisfaction within yourself. Find out specifically what you want to change in your life, to make better, and then prioritize ways to do that. This is within you, it has nothing to do with your partner. She is on her own journey to better herself right now too, hopefully you can support each other."
90,"Yup. You gotta throw the whole man away, OP."
91,"&gt;Have I fucked up my life?

Can you expand on why marrying someone who was forced into prostitution in order to survive has potentially ruined your life?  How has it specifically caused you personal hardship?"
92,"I don't think there's a way to tell her that won't offend her. But do you really need to tell her? If that's who she is, even if it's annoying, you can't change it. I know it's tempting with friends and family members to want to take the parts we like and get rid of the parts we don't, but ultimately we have to take or leave the whole package. If her annoyingness outweighs the nice times, then limit your time with her. Otherwise, you might just have to deal with the annoyance to have the nice times with her."

94,"It sounds strange but it looks like he wants to get you fat so you have zero self-confidence; it’s an easy way to get you to stay with him. A partner who loves you and supports you would understand that you are not feeling your best, and would encourage you to workout rather than put you down. I would tell you to drop the deadweight (aka him)."
95,"I want you to remember that he is an abusive manipulative terrible person, doing his best to isolate his victim. She’s begging him to stop and he keeps on going anyways. 

You don’t know what she said. She could have originally thought both of you were more upset with her specifically than either of you ever were, and her boyfriend could have twisted it into this narrative. There is no way this abusive man was ‘sticking up for her’ for her benefit. 

What you do need to do is realise she cannot be that friend you want until she removes herself from her relationship and/or from her parent’s house if her parents are also manipulative and controlling. As she will be manipulated and controlled by them until she breaks free, and that unfortunately makes her unable to be relied on for big things. 

Speaking as someone who has been in an abusive relationship, I wouldn’t go out with them together anymore. You could even frame it as you couldn’t stand him being so dismissive of her when you all were last out. That you support her and will be there for her and love to hang out with her but you would rather not interact with him anymore."
96,"Give her the car back, buy your own car, and go completely no contact with this awful, horrible, abusive piece of shit.

Reason doesnt work on someone like this."
101,"There are so many red flags all over this.

1) He drove agressively, to scare you. This is a a thing that does actually put you and also *everyone else on the road* at risk, but the big thing here is: he wanted you scared and stressed, because he was in a bad mood.

2) He called you a bitch in public and swore at you. You know that's not a thing most men do? It's not acceptable behaviour. 

3) I'm not even getting into the repeating what he did or making fun of you for being upset.

4) He's letting you know that he's plannon on punishing you for... not going with him to see his mum? It's his mum! And you went on your own two weeks ago!

5) As far as I can see, your only ""bad thing"" is slamming teh car door because you were frustrated. That's it. And that's *nothing*.

This does not sound like any kind of good relationship and I'm hard pressed to imagine that it will get better."
102,I didn’t come out until I was around 19 and my discomfort with myself was definitely projected onto my family and my dad in particular. I never really felt they’d reject me but I also never felt 100% sure they wouldn’t. It’s hard to understand your own manhood in the eyes of a father figure. Sometimes I wish my dad had lay it bear and made it impossible for me to deny how loved and safe I was. If your son isn’t sure why he’s so angry with you maybe there’s an opening there

As for your bf - the grass is always greener. If you spend a lot of time with someone (live with them, or just be around them a lot), you won’t have an enormous number of topics to talk about all the time. This happens with everyone. It would happen with this other guy you’re crushing on as well. I find the best remedy of this to go out and actually do something with your SO, because it puts you both in a new experience that you’ll have to talk about and discuss. Go to the zoo. Go to the park. Go camping on the weekend.

I ended up splitting primary care-giver duties with my Dad during my Mom's 13 months with terminal cancer.  I did have some breaks, but I should have had more of them - my siblings were supposed to step up, and decided I was doing such an awesome job that they didn't need to.  It is one of the larger reasons I don't really talk to them anymore - their careers and lives are toddling along just fine, but my consulting business died (you can't be a caregiver 1,000 miles away from your job and network), and my health and marriage took serious hits.

My mother was terminal - there was never any question of that - so there was an endpoint for me.  There is not one for you - and by the way, why were YOU so horrible when your brother was LIVING AT HOME? - and you need to create one.

118,"Maybe a compromise/stepping-stone would be that before going all-in, for a year or two he resumes his hobby coaching.

Also, part of this plan is rigid schedule to ensure he's fulfilling his duties at home, and to ensure that you have enough ""you"" time."

If you see yourself marrying him, bring it up frankly - he's the money maker, and while you can support yourself, you can't do it while living in this area without help.  If he loves you and wants to stay with you, he will start treating this like a joint problem to solve.

If you're not sure, girl, you're crippling yourself right now over a boy.  He is being petty over finances while you struggle. That is not something a loving person does, and you will regret every year you spend sharing a home with him saving nothing.  He could leave you and you'd effectively be poor for your current COL area.

124,"But OP, the only real answer here really is therapy. Your boyfriend has a pretty obvious mental health problem, and it's not going to go away by finding another barber. 

He lashed out when you brought it up, maybe because he's in denial, maybe because he deep down knows something is wrong and he's scared. Don't give up too soon, try to talk with him about it one more time, even if he does throw a tantrum at first. It might sink in after he has time to digest it. 

Thing about therapists is, he may need to try a couple before finding the right one. And he needs to stick with it long enough to give it a real chance. 

In the end, if he absolutely refuses any kind of treatment, or continues to not stick with it, you may have to leave for your own mental health's sake. But it doesn't sound like things are quite that far yet."
125,I'm gonna do this thank you.
126,"You're angry with him because he's harming himself to the point that he is unable to work, and that even being mobile for a day is a good thing. 

He's angry with you because you didn't pick up a 'good enough' pizza.

Forget the pizza. Focus on the issue: You're mad with him because he's harming himself. You don't see him taking the problem seriously enough. You're angry because he is unfairly holding you responsible for his poor choices. You're frustrated that he's putting you in a position where you can't win; You can either enable him or be insulted by him, or both.

Stop trying to read his mind or label his feelings. Clearly label your own. You are angry. You're right to angry. Start considering seriously what you are going to do about that -- you've got more options here than just getting him a smaller pizza."
127,"Dude this is serious red flag for me. The way you put it seems logical and what an adult would do. Her reaction is wildly inappropriate. I think you should stand your ground and definitely not apologize. Ask her why she has such problem putting your name on the account.
I wouldnt say this is a reason for breakup but be on rhe watch. Dont put your hard earned money somewhere you have little to no control (dont know how this shared account stuff works).
Hope this helps. Good luck."
128,To be honest you should NOT feel embarrassed. The one who should is that guy acting like a child. I don't really have any advice other than you 2 or not a match. You guys had a good run but unfortunately he can't keep up with you. Sex is his only concern and it seems to be a BIG one... on top of that he doesn't want to talk more then an hour... and wants ridiculous sex haha GTFO. So unfortunately he thinks that way.
129,There's a lot going on here. The cop isn't talking to you in a strictly professional sense if he's adding everyone on social media. But you and your BF weren't dating that long before you moved in together and it looks like you're seeing a different side to him if he reassures you he trusted you and then turned around and got angry.
130,"I disagree with those who are saying you should be thinking of “our money” or joining finances.  That’s a supremely bad idea when you’re not married to someone.  You can keep completely separate finances and still be a team and pay your fair share (proportional to income since your BF wants to live close to his work is only fair !) You shouldn’t be stretching yourself this far for someone who isn’t willing to be a team player with you.  But you don’t have to combine finances to be a team player.

My now-ex and I kept completely separate finances and had a prenup.  I was the higher earner, so I paid a greater proportion of the mortgage and bills, and I paid for pretty much all our fun stuff, vacations, stuff for his kids, etc.  We didn’t have combined finances but we were a team when it came to finances and what was fair.  And when he left me for another woman, the finance stuff was super easy because it was already laid out in the prenup and most everything was separate already.

Point being, you don’t have to have “joint” finances or “our money” to be fair and to be a team.  Keep separate finances and advocate for yourself to be treated fairly by paying proportional to your income.  If he is too selfish to agree to that, then break up.  You deserve a partner that would work with you as a couple, instead of being completely self-involved."
131,"My biggest concern is that he hadn't noticed how much you're struggling. At least I hope not, because if he has, it means he doesn't care at all. Which is WAY worse than money problems"
132,"My husband and I have a similar problem - I am a very light sleeper and no matter if I do all of my ""tricks"" I still just sleep infinitely better alone. Here is how we compromise:

\- I sleep in our guest room when I want to go to bed before him, have to wake up earlier than him, or have a big day I need to be rested for. This ends up being most weeknights.

\- Weekends I always make an effort to sleep with him. Sometimes I'll have to leave in the middle of the night, but we at least fall asleep together. Then in the morning, I come back up when I wake up (always earlier than him) and we lay in bed a little and cuddle if we have time. 

\- When we do sleep together, I wear a sleep mask and ear plugs. That might sound elementary but they've reduced about 75% of the things that used to make me do exactly what your wife does - jolt awake at night confused and alert at every little sound. I still do better sleeping alone, but this has helped a lot.

One final thing which also might sound obvious but may not be - we have a beloved cat who we finally realized we just couldn't allow to sleep with us. In mind, his presence was comforting (I had him when I was single) but in reality he was waking me up all night long every time he shifted or resettled. So if you have a pet you might want to make a similar decision, as heartbreaking as it might be at first. We got our cat an anxiety shirt and now everyone is all good. :)"
133,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion but do not do this. It nearly cost me everything, and it was all for nothing. We did everything advised above and it didnt work.  We ended nearly drstroyed financially and emotionally. I honestly hope it will be different for you."
134,"I would literally just say ""hey, yesterday when we were out with your mum, I noticed her English has really improved. I think she'd really appreciate it if you had let her practice with the waiter by letting her order for herself."" Done, deal, deuces. It's up to you if you want to explain a little more and say you thought it was rude. Surely if you've been together for years, this isn't that big of a deal to bring up."
135,"Take everything out of your bank account and put it into a new account at a different bank entirely, not just a different branch. You don’t owe them anything because you had no agreement. 

If your parents are pressuring you to sign documents then you should really pull your credit report. You’ve got to take the reigns here, whether or not you can find the energy.

Also, get your bank statements because if they can deposit money then they can take it out too. That’s probably where your money is going."
136,"I have a work conference next week for 5 days. He’ll be on his own with our toddler during that time. I normally make sure groceries are stocked and that our daughter is prepped for school for the week, but I may just go be free (mainly work) without putting life in perfect order before I leave. I will admit that he usually insists that I don’t do this, but I have a lot of trust issues now because of all the times he hasn’t followed through."
137,"That was pretty much the entire reason I didn't go before 25 (the college told me35 anyway). When I was 17 my dad was in Afghanistan and I lived with his wife. We didn't get along at all and she wound up kicking me out, so I was homeless until I was 18. Once I found an apartment, I applied for financial aid but they told me I had to submit my dad's financial records to qualify.

His wife flat-out refused to let him, so I didn't get to go.

 When I was 25 I had already been with my boyfriend for four years. I told him I was going to apply for college now that I could but he pulled the same bullshit, and I believed him, so I worked various jobs for two years and didn't go.

Well now I'm sick of it so I'm going anyway."
138,"My now fiance had a ""phase"" like this. Granted, we dont have kids and didn't have as much responsibility as OP has now, but it still sucked and I was pulling 99% of the weight. I made all the decisions, planned everything, balanced our books, etc. I made more than twice what my fiance made at the time, but it wasn't about money. It was about his lack of effort. Simply had no initiative at all. At home, at work, nothing. After college he was a weepy and entitled. Upset his art career hadn't taken off immediately after graduation. Upset he was working retail. He just...gave up. He let me do everything and I could have written OP's post myself. After about 2 years of that shit I was ready to quit. I was even the one doing job hunts for him! He wouldn't even apply to them and always found a reason to not like them. I remember in had picked him up from work (I'm the only one with a car) and we had pulled into the parking lot of our apartment. It was raining. I was fuming. I dont remember what the straw was, but I just let it fly. The truth. I told him essentially what your friend told their husband. I loved him so much, but it was like he was imaginary or didnt exist at all and i was ready to call it quits. I told him to ""get it or get out"". He got it. I NEVER condone ultimatums. But I was ready to walk out of that relationship without one, so what the hell, why not give him one last chance, no? He changed. Immediately. He also opened up to me about his frustrations, he was feeling depressed, etc. He just completely opened up about everything he was feeling and why he was resisting change. It's not that he was comfortable. It's that he wasnt confident. He felt that I expected him to fail all the time after so much disappointment so he just stopped trying. I too being the serial problem solver wasnt helping him help us. We worked out our problems after that, he got his shit together and 3 years later proposed to me. He is still improving even to this day. We both are. I got myself into therapy for my own shit and we are smooth sailing now."
139,"&gt; I really would have rather paid for an older car and had nothing over my head.


So do that. Buy a piece of crap, return her car, and never speak with her again. She's useless as support, and she's actively breaking you. Accept you have no mother."
140,"Exactly when my boyfriend cheated on me he tried to triangulate me against the woman. I literally told him I don't give a damn about who she is or what she looks like, this is about your level of integrity.he got all frustrated and turn red"
141,"So why tolerate it? This isn't what a healthy relationship looks like! You should be wondering what loving thing your partner will say next, or looking forward to your next conversation, not living in fear of the next stressful situation he deliberately puts you in. Why choose to live that way? Bear in mind if you call him out he'll probably claim you're being oversensitive, or making a fuss about nothing, or similar. Don't let him make you doubt yourself. **It doesn't matter** even if you are being oversensitive - a loving partner should give a shit about your sensitivities, not basically say ""well it's your fault it bothers you, it's going to keep happening""."
142,"And please do not dispose of him in a recycling receptacle, this is biological waste and needs to be incinerated."
143,"&gt; It's always ""I don't think about it"" ""you just want attention"" or ""it isn't important"". He is pretty active on social media.

Yeah he's lying. Those aren't valid reasons, they are just excuses. He's shockingly defensive about this and that leads me to believe there's an ulterior motive. Probably wants the illusion of being single for whatever it is he's doing online"
144,"I have a CPAP - It helps - I just don't use it for naps.  I wake her tossing and turning in the middle of the night.  Or going to bed 3 hours after she has on weeknights, or she wakes me getting up 3 hours before me on weekdays.

That said - anyone out there with sleep apnea - getting a CPAP changed my life.  I know what it feels like to wake rested.  Seriously if you are tired all the time check into one."
145,"Seriously, OP. She’s afraid of him. She has to do what he says. She has to go along with what he wants. Don’t get mad at her for this. He likely *wants* you to stop being friends with her, and he perhaps even knows that she’s told you the full story of their relationship. 

Also: the reason why she flakes when she thinks someone is mad at her is because she’s terrified of confrontation/anger due to having an abusive boyfriend. My mom was abusive and for a long time I was the same way — terrified of making someone angry at me because, to my subconscious, someone being angry at me meant that I was going to get screamed at for hours."
146,"Umm he is 32 years old, and he can’t manage to find an apartment that “he likes”.

I call bullshit he is using you to be rent free for awhile. He is an adult he knew for over a month he was being evicted, he should have made proper arrangements. He should not be free loading off of you, it is not your job to make sure he acts like an adult, you are not his mommy.

( side note- if he had a valid lease, and wasn’t a month to month tenant, he couldn’t be evicted because the land lord decided to sell, his lease would have transferred to the new owners. If he had a valid lease the old land lord pulled an illegal eviction and he might be able to fight them) 


You also might want to take a look at your lease agreement, and see what it says about overnight guests. Some leases state how long a visitor may stay before your land lord can file to evict you for braking your lease."
147,"He's just an asshole, it's not that complicated."
148,This is SUPER fresh. It doesn’t seem like it was initial a boundary to you(?). I would give yourself some time to process it before making any decisions. She told you this because she trusted you. There’s some weight behind that. But ultimately the choice is yours. I’d give yourself some time to think before acting
149,"Disclaimer, not a POC. I would bet he doesn't understand the time, cost and damage that you're taking into account. Looks and social pressures are only one part of the equation, plus it sounds like partly he's trying to encourage you to 'accept your natural beauty'. 

Having (probably) easy short hair means that he probably hasn't got any idea how hard hair can be to take care of, let alone more demanding hair. The majority of mens bathrooms I've seen stock 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner. 

Have you tried laying it out?

Wigs cost me x amount a year, take y amount of daily styling and prevent damage to hair. Plus I like the way I look. 

Braids take x amount of time, but means I take only y amount of time daily styling and prevent hair damage

Natural hair requires x amount of time every single day and night, creates y amount of damage, I would need to pay z amount on products and hair cuts to minimise but not eliminate this damage. This could lead to having to cut off yz amount of damaged hair."
150,"There's a chance he always wanted to be this super macho guy, and that one month at the gym gave him enough of a buff-high to idealize that image of himself ... 

I personally think this will wear off, but in the meantime, do tell him to stop disrespecting you. Let him have his fun, but not at your expense."
151,"I think you're well within your rights to ask your boyfriend to stop making comments about their bodies. Its super disrespectful, plus its just making you feel bad. 

Also, I can kind of speak from your friend's POV. I'm much more inclined to flirt and sleep around than my two best friends, and when I share all that stuff with them it isn't me trying to be braggy. Its a part of my life, sometimes a very big part, and I just want to share it or discuss it with friends who I love and trust. 

Its totally possible your friends don't even realize how you're feeling, or that you don't have as high an opinion of yourself that they have of you. And since you have a boyfriend, they might not be thinking that you'd even care whether or not random guys are chasing after you. 

If you haven't shared your feelings, it might be good to tell them how low you've been feeling about yourself. You don't have to come at it from a jealousy angle, but just that you havent had good feelings about your looks. If they're good friends, they'll care."
152,Telling him will only make it worse. Just focus on other things. You're still young. This isn't the end of the world. Better things are waiting if you open your eyes.
153,"Grandma is in cognitive decline. Paranoia, anger, all of those things are signs."
154,"This is... unfortunate. It's unfortunate that you have built a life with someone who ""lets"" you do anything, gives you a hard time about it, and treats your affection and attention as an obligation or a job for which you need to make up time.

But given that there is a child involved in this situation I guess I'd just recommend couples counseling so an educated third party can get involved and give her and you the proper tools with which you can navigate the relationship. Because this is not good."
155,"Agreed. I just went through this with relationship recently. We were long distance, and it wasn't so much about hiding me from friends (I did meet some of his), but it was more about his activities when I wasn't around. 

He had a lot of female ""friends"" as well - I noticed the activity on Instagram. He was clearly meeting other women. We had great communication in a lot of ways, and when we talked about the subject, he always maintained that they were all ""just friends."" I believed him because everything about our relationship seemed healthy - we always talked about feelings, insecurities, he always answered random phones calls at any hour, he never took more than a few minutes to reply to texts. All signs of good communication and strong interest in one another.

While I was there visiting last, I was staying with him and he left to go on vacation with his family. I got a call from him the next evening, breaking down that he had lied to me. That one of the women he had maintained was ""just a friend"" the entire time we were dating, was actually the person he was on the trip with. 

Odds are, you won't get that kind of overt confession, but my guess is, you're in a similar scenario. You're one of many women he is seeing.

Realistically, if your relationship was healthy, and they were truly ""just friends,"" then you meeting them and interacting with them shouldn't be a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice: Say goodbye. Delete. Block."
156,"Is he always like this? The rudeness just absolutely blows me away, going to the funeral isn't some fun outing designed for him to have a good time. Who cares if he's uncomfortable, he should be there to support YOU!"
157,"Thanks for your comment. It's just a shock to me as I only heard this information two nights ago. I wish it was easy to just block him and move on, but I am struggling with what happened."
158,"Yeah, I’m sorry for the bride and it must disappointing but I wouldn’t pay to travel to a wedding for someone I never see anymore. It’s one thing if you’ve all moved away but still meet up when possible and maintain that connection, but if all you do is the occasional message... it’s not surprising everyone’s turning down a wedding where they’d clearly have to travel, book accommodation etc."
159,"&gt;  Do l have the right to force my roommates to live with BF? 

No. He's not on the lease. You don't get to unilaterally decide who lives there. If anything the lease likely prohibits guests staying that long anyway. It's ridiculous that he'd expect people who don't like him to just accept him living there for a month +. Your roommates are being crazy accommodating already - they don't like this guy, you said a week or so and he's suddenly saying 6 weeks! They have every right to just not let him in tonight to be honest but they're giving him a week. 

He's the one making a mess - he was given a month's warning and now is demanding another 6 weeks? That's a crazy long time to find a place."
160,"&gt;You are costing yourself a future by dating him right now.

Thank you for this statement. As obvious as it is, I'm just now realizing how true this is. For the past year or so, I've felt very depressed about the future, like I have nothing to look forward to. I haven't been able to pin down WHY I was feeling like this until now (even though it's so obvious)."
161,"He's not going to let your kid starve. (If he is, it's a different issue altogether.) If you leave on a Monday, tell him Sunday. ""Oh, by the way, I didn't have a chance to grocery shop / do laundry / meal prep this week. It's all on you."" 

See how it goes."
162,Have you thought about surgery for the snoring? Your doctor May be able to code it in a way where insurance covers it
163,"Why they get all the guys? Baby girl, you have a boyfriend. You don’t need other men macking on you all the time for validation.

The real problem is your boyfriend BLOWS. 

Typically, you’d get that feeling of being desired from him but it’s doing a terrible job. I don’t know how old that kid is but he is extremely inconsiderate of your feelings. I’m not saying dump the guy but you should have a very serious conversation about how he makes you feel:

You tell me my friends are beautiful. It makes me feel ugly, inadequate, and insecure. Why do you think it’s okay to talk to me like this? Why don’t you tell me I’m beautiful? You’re supposed to love me and my body. Why do you talk about other women to me? Why do you think that’s okay?"
164,"I know this is easier for me to say than jr is to believe but you have nothing to be ashamed of.

Taking away all the issues of weight loss and just looking at the current reality, this is a need that you have and as a human being who deserves dignity and respect, you should give yourself permission to accept that this need is okay.

I would tell her the truth. I would say “Friend, you might have noticed I have been avoiding the idea of visiting your apartment and I want to tell you why. I would love to see your place and I think you have lovely taste, but I also know that the weight limits on furniture from the places you have mentioned often don’t meet my needs. I have been embarrassed about this and trying to avoid the topic, but I didn’t want you to think I don’t care for you or want to see something you are so proud of...”

Then I would think about what would work for you and to suggest it to her. Could you come over for a tour, but then hang out in a place that is more comfortable for you? Would you be able to bring a portable chair of some kind that is comfortable to sit on? Does she want to check the stats on some of her furniture to find out if she does have something that could be comfortable for you?

I know it is hard to do, but I think the most important thing to do is to work on letting go of the shame. The shame keeps your life very small and you don’t deserve that. It sounds like this friend cares for you and is excited to share her life with you. That is about you as a person, not your pants size. You are concerned about something very practical (the furniture) but the reason you don’t want to be honest is because of the shame and not feeling good enough.

You are always good enough to need what you need and to live a comfortable life. You don’t have to earn those things; those are just some of the rights that humans get. I don’t know if it will help, but you might want to look up the essay “The Fantasy of Being Thin,” by Kate Harding. It does come from a body acceptance perspective, but even if you do want to lose weight, I think that seeing that you deserve a life at any size can be ultimately very helpful is removing the idea that you should wait until you are “worthy” to speak up honestly and receive love and respect in return."
165,My suggestion: use a passphrase: don’t just use one word. Think of a phrase that is 4 or 5 words long that you can remember but is hard to guess.
166,"This is some criminal minds shit, girl. This is the most terrifying post I have ever read on here. Holy shit you need to run. Take your kid before she grows up more broken than you are and run. Do you have family? Or go to a women’s shelter. I’m assuming your sex life is borderline marital rape."
167,You two seem totally incompatible. The kids issue alone is a dealbreaker. You will not be happy in a marriage with this woman IMO.
168,"That's unfair and you're even recognising that this is selfish:

&gt;""He will be on time if its something HE is excited for, like a hockey game.""

I'd have a serious talk with him about it, you're already considering leaving him and that's a huge deal, especially if you're adamant that everything else is fine. Ultimately though I think it'd be best to split up, considering the next alternative is huge commitment and even marriage. You don't wanna be married to someone you can't rely on."
169,"Yes this anonymous person's actions are a problem, but honestly the main problem is that your girlfriend doesn't believe you! There's no evidence of any of this, because it didn't happen, and yet she's completely disregarding your character and your history together and calling you a liar. So don't try and defend things that didn't happen, don't try and find witnesses to justify your argument - you need to stand your ground and say it's all bullshit, she's being fed lies, and it's a real problem that she's believing other people over you. If she wants to dump you, she needs to do it, because there's nothing you can do to prove a negative, especially if she doesn't want to believe you.

I mean you can be really direct and say that if she ends your relationship over something so artificial, that's her decision and you can't stop her, but if/when she realises the truth and that she's made a mistake, you won't have any interest in getting back together, because why would you want to be with someone who'll discard you so casually? She's not ""being"" manipulated, she's **allowing** herself to be fed this crap and the very fact that she's buying into it means your relationship was already in serious trouble because of her lack of trust in you."
170,"what are all these 30yr old dudes doing hanging around 20yr old young women? and the way he calls you a liar and that it ""changed the way he saw \[you\]"" - this is about more than faces. when you're in your mid to late 20s and look back on this, you'll be dismayed that you thought this sort of treatment was normal or ok. he doesn't want a woman on equal footing with him, because they wouldn't put up with this sort of thing."
171,"Were you doing anything during the time you were supposedly cheating? Do you have receipts, debit card transactions, Google Activity (if you don't know what this is Google it, it's different from plain search/internet history), tickets, call history, etc you can provide to prove to her you did not do this? Is the person in question saying you called/texted her - in which case you can call your phone provider and see if a call/text log from that week could be brought up to show to her?"
172,"Personally, I think this man has consistently shown you that he is always looking at something else. To me, it seems like he just placates you when you find out and makes an effort to make it seem like that’s not what’s going on.... until you find out again. It just doesn’t come across like he even wants to change. Additionally, someone anonymous was bothered enough by it to send it to you. This behavior would indicate to me that he is not trustworthy and he’s taking advantage of your willingness to work through it/try and make things work."
173,"Don't share the private details of your life with bigots.  If these are the opinions and judgments they think are safe to share in public, just imagine what private beliefs they withhold because they know they're inappropriate.

These aren't friends, these are just assholes you happen to work near."
174,"&gt;I don’t even advocate for myself anymore. Just writing this makes me very sad.

Oh god, I felt like that towards the end of my 15 years with my ex-husband. 

I don't put any stock in dreams and I hardly ever remember what they were like. But I remember clearly a few times in my life where I had the same dream, where I had to scream but my voice closed up and I couldn't make a sound. After I decided to file for divorce, I had that dream one last time, only this time I could scream loud and clear. I haven't had that dream since, six years later.

it felt so joyful and strong, finally feeling like I was advocating for myself and for my children. Mine was kind of an extreme case, but it sounds like maybe yours is too. I wish for you that your husband will pull his head out of his ass and realize that he's risking his marriage and his happy family life, or that you do whatever you need to do to make life better for yourself and your kid."
175,I think you need to give serious consideration to going very low-contact with them.

177,I don't think you're straight.
178,"You sound fairly similar to my girlfriend. She works full time, has a similar routine to you and doesn't really have any hobbies I could point at right now (has in the past). 
 
A while ago I was thinking it'd be nice if my girlfriend had more hobbies/interests, and I also found myself getting bored/dissatisfied. I wasn't sure why her hobbies should have any relation to my boredom or dissatisfaction. 

I looked at the root of the issue and found that I had been sinking in with her and watching TV every night after work. There's nothing inherently wrong with this after a day's work of course. I personally am not a fan but admittedly do still veg out on the regular (more than I'd like)... 

If I do that stuff too much I can easily become soft and can quite quickly start neglecting my social life, personal pursuits and fitness. These are all integral for my maintaining my mental health. 

Her lack of hobbies led to me neglecting my own hobbies and social life because I felt kind of guilty for pursuing them, as I felt I was leaving her high and dry by doing those things without her, along with obviously missing time spent with her. It sounds like I'm blaming her, but really I never blamed her for it at all. She is perfectly content like yourself. It was all in my head. 

Eventually, after discussion, I realised what was happening and just did what I wanted/needed to do anyway. She of course was never worried at all, it was all in my head, and was happy for me to do what I needed/wanted. The time spent apart is good for us and is healthy for the relationship. 

We've since developed some shared hobbies as well (outside of tv shows etc) which is nice. I still think it'd be good for her to pursue other things and she agrees. There's just a lack of follow through. Anyway I digress. 

Maybe my perspective and experience is similar to your husband in some way? Maybe he just needs to pursue more hobbies or interests and is projecting.


Sorry for the long self-centred post, hope it's actually helpful."
179,"Good lord, you have to deal with this quickly. There is no reason on gods green earth you should have to justify your leisure activities that have no impact on him. 
Probably most people would not react as harshly as me, but this would be a massive deal breaker for me. It’s incredibly important I be able to have my free time to do things as I choose. This would be a “back off or I’m gone” moment."

182,"I guess it's kind of like how your keys are always in ""the last place you look for them"" because of course you're not going to keep looking once you've found them. Everybody's current partner was their last choice in a way"
183,"I think it’s one of those things where you should sit down and tell him how much you love him and care for him, but if he can’t get his shit together you won’t have a future. And if he can’t respond positively to that in the following months, call it quits."
184,"If you want to have fun with her :

screenshot your desktop screen, hide all the icons and replace the wallpaper with the screenshot. She'll think it's broken and probably stay away LOL

185,"&gt;First of all, I'm not sure how that came about.  The best way to handle expenses is from a joint account to which you are both contributing.

I know it's recommended, but we don't have a joint account. For groceries, one of us will pay first and the other will give the other person half, in cash or through Venmo.

&gt;Money issues are the second most common factor in divorces, and now you  know why.   If you can't talk to him about this now, you are just  putting off a bigger argument.

Yes. I've heard this all the time and I totally get it now!"
186,"Your dad is an asshole who married another asshole. You cannot and will not be able to do anything that will change his mind. He already burned ties with your brother, and doesnt care about his grandchild. He has made it very clear he is also willing to burn ties with you."
187,"&gt; the nature of my job means that it would be easiest for me to become the primary caretaker of this baby.

This might very well be true *financially* and *logistically*, OP, but I don't think it's a great idea for you *personally*. As strong as your relationship is with your BF, you've still only known him for a grand total of 8 months. That's a very short time in the grand span of things. You aren't even engaged, and under normal circumstances folks would strongly advise against that level of commitment less than a year in.

As much as you love and care for your BF, and support his decision to take full custody of (presumably) his child, please don't let this artificially accelerate the progression of your relationship to warp speed. Don't rush to become your BF's child's primary caretaker when you previously (I assume) didn't even envision marrying your BF until at least another year down the road.

The best thing is to re-envision dating your BF as dating a single dad. Because that's effectively what he is: A single dad. If that's a red line for you, don't cross it just because of this unexpected development in your BF's life.

As other posters have said, you don't have to necessarily make any final decisions now. It'd be perfectly okay, for example, for you to want to try to maintain your relationship for now, but then realize, a few months down the line, that it isn't right for you. (The baby's very young age also helps, in a sense - you won't permanently scar the baby if you decide, say, after 3 months to break up with your BF. The baby likely won't even remember you at all pretty soon.)"
188,Just because you’ve heard worse stories on here does not invalidate how messed up your situation is. People are always going to have worse or better situations than you. What matters is how YOU feel about YOUR situation.
189,"If I were you, I'd like to know. I don't see what she's getting out of this, other than potentially not having her nudes on an ex's phone/laptop. You can look if it's safe to do so, and if there's nothing, that's great, because then you can relax knowing your boyfriend is a decent guy or you can look and find out he still has them, in which case it's fucked up and you should know sooner rather than later what kind of guy he is. You'd probably want a girl to help you out too if you were in that position. Just my 2 cents."
190,"Start using pictures that don't conceal it, and own it. I'm a big girl on dating sites and I always use full body pictures because I don't want anyone's time, including mine, wasted. The same principle applies here"

192,"&gt; My husband just is not big into keeping in touch. 

Maybe he has the right idea."
193,"I loved your emotional honesty in this post. It seems like you may be the kind of person where writing things out expresses your truer emotions better than trying to say them, especially when it is a conversation about emotions. Maybe this is kind of a wild idea...but think about writing your son some letters. Almost like love letters. You do love him, so I guess they would be love letters :) You could aim to write him one a week, and just drop them off with him. It feels like a way to share your feelings with him in a way where he can absorb the contents on his own terms and his own time. And you can maintain a connection with him while he works through a really emotional and hormonal time of his life, compounded by exploration of his sexuality. Letters like that would be something he would probably treasure in the future. I personally have the personality type where something like this would be far more approachable in rebuilding a relationship than forced outings or conversations.  

As far as his behavior, as a non-straight person myself, I wonder if he's pulling away from the traditionally-masculine connections with you and leaning into his mom more, since he's already playing around with concepts of sexuality, which is inherently tied to gender roles. It's tough to be a queer kid and navigate not feeling like you fit into the ""normal"" when surrounded by a family structure that seems more traditional and heterosexual.  

Final piece of advice -- actively think about your interactions with other family members, friends, the media you consume, and what overheard conversations and discussions might mean to a gay kid. Things that feel really normal to you could feel very much like an attack on who he is or loves. If you haven't heard of microaggressions, maybe do a little research. It could do a lot to make him feel more comfortable with you going forward. Even the most progressive and open people can often do better! And it's worth learning things and adjusting behavior for your kid."
194,"Knowing an ex has underage nudes of you that he apparently refuses to delete is a big deal. Refusing to delete them is a big deal. And ""overdramatic"" goes along with ""crazy"" in terms of words men use about their exes to make them seem unreasonable. If it's been two years and this is the first you've heard of her, I don't see anything wrong with honoring her request. Once she stopped dating him, she implicitly withdrew consent for him to have any interaction with her nude body, including pictures."
195,"This is a possibility. When we first got back into town, we weren't in the best state financially until he began work. We stayed with them for a week while waiting to hear about the house so they likely heard us talking about potentially getting state assistance and struggling not knowing if we'd get the house or have to move to someplace more pricey. So it'd make sense for them to think we are still struggling. It'd also explain why they brought our kid 3 grocery bags full of baby food as if we are a charity case."
196,"1) Your parents need to talk to an estate planning attorney-at a minimum the money should be put in trust for your sister with you as the trustee and her as the sole beneficiary.  Problem solved.

&amp;#x200B;

Your husband is angry at the world-is that solely atriibutible to his dad's death or was he easily offended before? Regardless he does need to be in therapy and you may need to help him find someone.

&amp;#x200B;

You have apologized (even though you didn't do anything wrong) -stop groveling and explaining-your husband heard you-he just wants to be angry and he wants you to feel bad too-so stop"
197,"I’m struggling to see what benefit you get out of this relationship. 

Seems like he gets someone to subsidize his rent and cook his meals for him. 

What do you get? Someone to force you to live in a more expensive area than you’d like, and someone to cook meals for? 

He’s the one who’s not pulling his weight. You shouldn’t feel guilty at all. You should be horrified at how you’ve let yourself be treated and GTFO ASAP. Like seriously, just move out whenever your lease is up and then never see him again. He’s using you."
198,"Yes there is.  Tell him it was freakish, weird looking and shitty to have sex with.    Like, a lot."
199,"I’m going to add onto this because I think it’s good to be hopeful that things will improve but also important to realize and recognize that sometimes you’ve hit the point of no return. my ex husband and I had an almost identical conversation a year before we separated. You eventually are going to have to draw your line in the sand and say no more and issue an ultimatum. 

With my Ex, I was the adult, I paid bills, kept the house running, managed every single detail in his life because he refused. In the end I was so resentful that I couldn’t even put forth the effort to try to work things out. 

There was lots of promises to change, share the burden and responsibility in the over a decade we were married, but no attempts, it wasn’t important enough to change and the day I asked him to pack and move out he was shell shocked and told me he never thought I was really serious that I was reaching the end, he thought I was just huffing and puffing like the hundreds of times before and if he ignored me I would get over it. 

The kiss of death was the day after he moved out I made a detailed list of his bills, log in information to pay them online and told him he needed to get his phone out of my name and he called me and asked if I would call his mom and give her all the information so she could handle it for him. 

Some people are incapable of being responsible and pulling their weight in the relationship. For your sanity and the opportunity for your relationship to survive and recover you’re going to have to set a point of no return. I would seriously consider couples therapy in addition to individual therapy. The therapist I saw recommended we establish checkpoints and dates by which things needed to be accomplished in terms of leasing his codependency and making him stand on his own two feet. I think obviously he has some issues he needs to work through individually, and you will benefit from individual sessions but as this point it sounds like there’s zero effort being put forth on his part. I’m not usually one who is in favor of ultimatums however, my therapist told me I needed to set up boundaries and stick to them, even if it means that the marriage didn’t survive."
200,Thanks. I hadn't thought to leave the house. That's very smart.
201,"Yep, if anything, having this meeting might validate her complaints in her eyes. OP, this is the kind of thing that it's best not to acknowledge; let her keep talking like a crazy person while you're still going business as usual. 

Your issue is your husband feeding this whole thing for his own amusement. He's being a very shitty husband, and it sounds like you're now desperately trying to find ways around his behaviour, rather than addressing the issue directly. I understand that it's scary to realize that your partner doesn't have your back and that this is a major hit to your relationship, but trying to deal with this woman directly does nothing to address the issues that you have your husband. Fixing her badmouthing still leaves you with a shitty husband, unfortunately."
202,"&gt;Later I checked his phone and he had texted his female coworker before we had went to dinner. He wanted to make me mad by him hugging her. She didn’t want to.

He told her he wanted her to let him hug her, to make you mad?

Don't marry this man.

&gt;He is also very obsessed about me changing my hair color, hair style and wearing makeup.

Don't marry this man!

You will set yourself up for God knows how many years of mind-games and controlling behaviour. :("
203,"So, I really don't blame you for not wanting to do a vow renewal. After all, your wife was meant to keep to the vows she made to you at your wedding, and clearly didn't. It's one thing to forgive your wife and choose to maintain a relationship with her, and another to hold a ""vow renewal"" as though to rub in that the first lot of vows didn't stick. 

But I'm a little surprised by your comments that after *four years* of therapy:

&gt;Her cheating is still a bit fresh   
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think we've quite reach that point **yet**   
&gt;  
&gt;our relationship isn't truly healed **yet** 

You say ""yet"" as though a happily-ever-after is just another year or another therapy session away. You (and your wife) need to face that that ""yet"" might *never* come, and honestly if four years of therapy hasn't gotten you to that point, I don't think it ever will. You may have forgiven your wife, but I don't think any amount of therapy or time will ever change the fact that your wife cheated on you and it hurt*.* It will always feel ""a bit fresh"". It's a scar that your marriage will always have. It doesn't have to define your marriage, but you can't erase it or pretend it never happened. 

So either have a think about what you need in your life/marriage/therapy to actually get to that ""yet"" point you believe exists, or accept that your marriage will always carry this scar of your wife's past infidelity. No amount of therapy will erase it. Either make peace with it, or don't."
204,"Some parents have a hard time bringing their idea of you up to match reality. Like, my mom still thinks of me as a teenager. She constantly references how bad of a cook I am and how much I hate cooking....even though I grew to like cooking as an adult and am pretty good at it. She loves the food I make for her when she comes to visit. But for whatever reason, she can't seem do change the image in her head that I hate cooking and am bad at it. I was bad at it and hated it when I was 16, but I'm 31 now.

When you moved back, you were financially struggling. That is the image of you that they have in their heads, and that's what they're basing their actions on. Even though it isn't reality. So they think you're too lazy to work even though you're super poor and living on the dole. 

Your husband needs to tell them that isn't the case. They aren't going to accept any reasons you give them."
205,"Yeah, that sucks to find out. But the key question now is does he still view you as last choice?

If he does, you guys are doomed. If not, and he's madly in love with you and wants only you and no one else (or you're otherwise his first choice now), then maybe you two have a chance. But that's going to ultimately be your call, though."
206,Tbh his parents will probably feel this way about any girl he dates who doesn’t have a fortune of their own. It’s a common thing with wealthy people. Try to not let it bother you. Hard I know but if you let them live in your mind rent free it will cause issues in your relationship. Just be yourself. Concentrate on your relationship and working towards your career.
207,"""We married for purely practical reasons (healthcare and taxes) if that makes a difference.""

Well...then divorce him for the obvious reasons? It seems absurd to stay married to an abusive man you won't move with and are afraid of."
208,She admitted to you that she would not tolerate any similar behavior from you if the roles were reversed in this situation. Yet she feels bold enough to be disrespectful towards you and your relationship and lie about it multiple times. She doesn't respect you. I don't think that's something you can get past and have a fulfilling relationship.
209,"Ugh, this. Please, this. Cancel this meeting. OP has planned a meeting to clear the air with a person being inappropriate AF with her ostrich husband...to what end? OP will get this woman to stop talking the sh!t? No, she won't. 

Whatever this profession is, they all sound unprofessional. A ""meanie""?"
210,"&gt;I think you’ve got it OP. Most of the time that we are attracted to another person, it isn’t something about them we are attracted to, it is the positive way we feel about ourselves in their presence, but we project it onto them. So there is some need, desire and drive within you to chase that feeling that you want to feel within you. It has nothing to do with these attractive women, you want to feel that satisfaction within yourself. Find out specifically what you want to change in your life, to make better, and then prioritize ways to do that. This is within you, it has nothing to do with your partner. She is on her own journey to better herself right now too, hopefully you can support each other.

Wow, I think this is spot on. I definitely think these feelings are a projection of how I felt around those people. I'm saving this comment for future. Very wise words - thank you."
211,Your issue isn’t with her you have a husband issue. He needs to grow a pair or you need to let him know in no uncertain terms we (your relationship) is not going to end well. You shouldn’t have to feel the way you do and have this threat hanging over your head. My next question is why doesn’t he want to shut this women down? People usually do things for a reason. Not condoning the behavior  but you probably already know you got more going on here than this women. Counseling probably wouldn’t hurt you and your husband.
212,I am a 10 year walk away wife with 4 kids. His mother coddled him and then I tried for 10 years to wait for him to grow up. Never happened.
213,"&gt; I'm not sure if I should not go and stay with my girlfriend, or if I should go to the graduation regardless of what my girlfriend thinks. 

Uh..dude. The latter. 

**You don't miss your own sisters graduation just because your girlfriend is going to pout.** The fact that you're even considering skipping your sister's graduation just to stay home with pouty girlfriend, because you're afraid how she'll react, is immensly messed up and shows a pretty big relationship red flag.

Also, there's no reason or your girlfriend to go in the first place, assuming she's not close with your sister (and it sounds like she isn't). My brother's SO didn't come to my graduation, her and I aren't close, hardly see each other, there was no reason for her to be there. Because **graduations are about the person graduating**, not the SO of one of the family members. Hell, they aren't even about the family members at all. 

It sounds like this relationship should end if you can't even comfortably communicate with the other party that is in this relationship with you. You shouldn't be afraid to talk to your own girlfriend. Sounds toxic.

Again - **this is about your sister, she is the important party, here**. Don't ruin graduation for her by bringing your relationship problems to it."
214,"Just because a person has proposed to you doesn't mean they're spouse material.

Spouses are not fancy boyfriends. A spouse must possess certain qualities and character."
215," Very weird. Sounds like she wants to be the one in control of your finances.

Also...

&gt;She stormed off telling me how much she hates me, hates every second with me. Not the first time she's said this

Absolutely not ok. This would be enough for me to break up with someone."
216,"I think other commenters seem to have fully covered how absolutely shitty your boyfriend is, and how it sounds like you should just walk away from that whole situation. But let me just go ahead and put out there – 

&gt;She is naturally very skinny, but has a very strict and regimented work out and eating plan that she is very dedicated to. She’s also naturally gifted with a bottom half (a butt, yes), which I don’t have at all. 

You know that's a contradiction, right? I think a lot of people who talk about other people who ""naturally"" have great bodies don't appreciate how much work that actually takes for 99% of those folks. There's definitely some element of natural gift going, but the majority of this comes down to her ""strict and regimented work out and eating plan."" You are saying she dedicates significant thought and effort into her physical appearance, which indicates it is a big interest/priority for her. I don't know why it would be surprising that, at the end of the day, she is really proud of what she's accomplished here. She does the squats to get that ass. She does the crunches to get that waist. She skipped the burger and ate the salad and she isn't ashamed to reap the benefits of that work. Maintaining a strict diet is a conscious choice you make every minute of the day, so this is actually a pretty huge deal and I can see why she would often have the benefits she sees from it on her mind. You may find it tedious, and that's fine. But she is not just naturally some perfect creature who lucked into a beautiful life you could never have – she is someone who is seriously concerned with her physical appearance and has gone to lengths to cultivate the life she wants, and isn't hiding the fact that that is a big part of who she is.

I'm not saying this to shame you or anything, but imagine it this way – you have a friend who got a degree in Aerospace Engineering. They routinely talk about how much they love being a rocket scientist. If you secretly wanted to be a rocket scientist your whole life, but you decided on another path, would you resent them for being proud and talking about their accomplishments? Would you be bored because you don't really have that in common anymore? Would you feel inspired to go back to school and get that degree? Would you put distance into the friendship? Would you do some dabbling online in the topic so that you have more to talk about when it comes up? Would you ""make some backhanded comment"" when they talk about their life? I don't think there is a right answer to this question, but it's something that I think you should feel empowered to decide for yourself. If you don't want to invest in your physical appearance the way your friend has, I think that is perfectly, 100% fine. But you need to adjust your expectations about what the result of that is – it probably isn't all kinds of random dudes falling all over you (which frankly, I see as a huge plus, because that sounds fucking annoying). What you CAN expect, though, is a significant other who loves and respects you and doesn't make you feel like shit about yourself by talking openly about how hot your friends are.

Ultimately, these women aren't making you insecure. The main person who is making you insecure is you, partially through your decision to stay with a shitty boyfriend. There is a **significant** chance that he says things like this *specifically* to lower your self-esteem so that you'll feel like you have to put up with his bullshit, because you don't think you can do better. I guarantee you: you can do better. Dump the dead weight you're dating before he grinds your confidence any further into the ground, and work on seeing yourself as an investment. Whether it's hitting the gym more and doing squats so you can finally get that ass, or taking a class in something you're interested in, you need to find a skill that you can slowly improve at over time, to help you build your self image back up. Then you can annoy all of your friends with how good at [pottery/curling/weight lifting/stone carving/macramé/whatever] you are."
217,"If she has children because you want them and not because SHE does, she will resent you and those kids for the rest of her days."
218,"OP - Your relationship with your girlfriend is NOT GOOD. You need to seriously re-evaluate this situation. 

Also, GO TO THE GRADUATION! This is a celebration of your sister's accomplishment, it has literally NOTHING to do with your girlfriend. (And be sure to thank your parents for footing the bill!)"
219,"&gt; my partner who had a long week let me, albeit unhappily

Sounds like your relationship is dysfunctional, adults don’t “let” other adults go out in a good relationship."
220,"Unpopular opinion here.. but I feel like you’ve been wanting a reason to break up and this is a good one for ya.
I’ve had opposite schedules while in a relationship and I never for a moment felt I was single. Because I wasn’t. Nor was I “wasting my life”. 
If he was “the one” you’d have zero question about sticking it out while he looked for another job. But clearly he isn’t."
221,"Your sister's actions sound a lot like someone who is in deep, deep denial about their situation.  Being a teenager can be an emotionally tumultuous time, and I'd imagine having multiple chronic illnesses doesn't help her self-image.

Her every action seems in defiance to her diagnosis: eating things she can't, refusing medication, being afraid of needles, etc.  She's actively rebelling, as teenagers are want to do, and is choosing to do so against this monolithic, immovable thing in her life.  Her illness isn't something she wants to face, let alone work *with*.

The reason that she doesn't want you around in these situations are probably multi-faceted.  I'll list a few possibilities.

* Your presence at her treatments, reminders about medication and allergies, and the like come from a place of care and love.  However, since the illnesses are the enemy in her mind, anybody related to the illness (or who tries to make her confront it in any significant way) is also the enemy.  As much as you are coming from a place of love, she just sees you as someone trying to drag her back to the reality she doesn't want to face.

* As her sibling, who doesn't seem to have the same sort of issues she has, she may hold resentment for you.  The situation she is in isn't one you had to live through, and that's unfair.  Your ""help"" with the illness just reminds her that you don't really understand her feelings around the situation, it just reminds her that you *can't* really understand her situation.

* Being a teenager is a lot about being able to ""fit in"".  Having a chronic illness with multiple rules, regulations, and stipulations isn't a ""normal"" thing to have.  She may be trying to ignore her illness to try and be a bit more like everybody else, because she sees it as some kind of ""ostracizing factor"".  Accepting her illness could be the same as accepting her place apart from her peers, which terrifies her.

Regardless of the reason she's acting this way, I think the only thing that'll help her is therapy.  She's lashing out and trying to rebel in many (understandable) ways, but I don't think she really understands/realizes the consequences her actions could have in the long-run if she keeps this up.  Your constant attempts to help just remind her of the reality of the situation, which she is constantly trying to avoid.  Ergo, your presence is stressful, because the reality of her situation is stressful."
222,"Is this some kind of fundamentalist Quiverfull-type situation, where you can't hold hands or hug until you're engaged? 

At her age, she has to be the one to make the break from her family's restrictive rules, I'm afraid."
223,"What goals are you working towards as a couple? Are you planning to marry, grow old together, etc? Or were you just having fun for a few years of your youth? 

If you mainly were dating for companionship and fun now, then yeah it makes sense to break up with him. You aren’t getting companionship at the moment, and you could get it somewhere else. 

But if you’re planning to spend your life together, don’t end the relationship in haste. I know 6 months feels like a long time but in the grand scheme of life it’s not much. How long will he have to stay in this job before he could change companies? Another 6 months? Sacrificing for one year if it results in excellent career and financial opportunities, could be worth the sacrifice. 

Relationships that are based on constant unwavering physical companionship are susceptible to break in many situations - illness, work, travel. If you want long-term relationships it’s stronger to build them on a sense of belonging to the same team and working together towards shared goals or ends."
224,"He does, yes. When he found out the schedule was permanent, I very clearly told him I was unsure what that meant for us. I said we could see if we could adapt and what time we could find together, because any change can be hard, but there just IS no time. We're on totally opposite schedules, totally opposite days. We have like 3 hrs each weekend morning, before he has to start getting ready and leave for work. That's it. 

When they cancelled his vacation I also very clearly told him that while I knew it wasn't his doing, that was *another* thing we couldn't share and now this one cost money. 

He's unhappy with it too but we were really struggling before, especially him since he had hit a rough patch of bad luck and took on a lot of credit card debt. He was glad he could pay that off. Now we're not struggling but our relationship is a corpse."
225,"Honestly, it’s up to your wife to let your friends know they crossed the line. If she’s not comfortable advocating for herself, then she needs to give you permission to let them know that joking about her intellect is a line that they shouldn’t cross with her. That’s really the best way to guarantee this won’t happen again. 

Is it really scary to tell someone they’ve hurt us? Yup. Is it also a necessary part of being in relationship with other human beings? Yup. 

As for how you can be helpful in the moment, I have a couple of ideas. (1) don’t pile on. If everyone is joking about her answer, don’t join in (not saying you did do that here; it doesn’t seem like you did, but just in case you get the urge to in the future). (2) saying something like “oooo, interesting answer/word, babe. I can totally see how you came up with that. Thinking outside the box! Love your creativity” can go a long way, especially if you’re the first one to jump in. (3) vocally compliment and encourage her when you’re playing games with your friends. (4) remind your friends that something’s only a joke if everyone’s laughing. Sounds like your girlfriend kind of played along here, but you can always step in when it goes too far and say “ok guys, we get it” 

But honestly, I still think the best way to approach this is to tell your friends that what they did wasn’t cool, and they took it a bit too far. 

Your wife is allowed to have sore spots. It doesn’t mean she’s overly sensitive, or can’t take a joke in general. It simply means that jokes about this one topic are off limits. If your friends are even halfway decent people, their response will be “oh man, we’re so sorry, we didn’t know that was a sore spot for her. We definitely won’t do anything like that in the future.”"
226,"It's completely OK if you can not give her the relationship she wants and you need to break up. This transition may be wonderful for her mental health and well being, but it doesn't get to come at the determinant to yours. You might find some benefit in sitting down with a therapist who is LGBTQ+ positive."
227,"&gt; Edit: also, in what way are secrets a dealbreaker? If they were, you'd have ended this like two months in. You've been letting this guy stomp all over your boundary for a year and a half...

right??"
228,"Given your post history, I can’t help but to wonder if porn is affecting how you view your “other half” and the dynamics of your relationship. Are you being satisfied sexually?"
229,"I’m sure he did bring it up to cause issues, but I don’t think he was twisting the specifics of what she said. Last night she was saying things like “we all talked together and worked it out” which is a lie, and “I’m not *that* upset anymore” - rather than what I’d expect which would be “it wasn’t like that” or “I didn’t say he confronted me”"
230,"Super creepy. I'd save screenshots of all the messages, let her know that if she persist in contacting you you'll take them to HR, and then block her. She's crossed into harassment territory and it's not okay."
231,"Um, your day was not ruined because 'you got upset over his gaming habit again'.

The day was never going to happen, because while you tidied and generally acted like an adult, he couldn't even put the controller down to go have the breakfast together he suggested. 

You got upset because he ignored you. He made plans and then broke them. Worse of all, he told you that he was *choosing to ignore you*. 

Then, instead of an actual apology, he wordlessly sends you $60. Gross. 

You've signed up for years of this. You intend to sign up for a lifetime of it?"
232,"That's assault. They can't try and twist it any other way because she entered your room when you were sleeping and then told a lie that doesn't match up - as they usually knock or call to wake you.

You need to tell your dad. You don't need to tell your girlfriend right away - or ever, if you don't want to, it's your business. Again, this was *assault*. You didn't cheat, you got abused. However, if you want to tell her, you should. Once you're ready. Just make sure she knows that you had nothing to do with it, you were sleeping when your step-mother molested you. She shouldn't be jealous of this *or* angry at you, and if she gets angry at you for this when it really wasn't your fault, you shouldn't be with her. That kind of reaction would be damaging and unfair, especially after something as heavy as this just happened.

But please, tell your dad."
233,"&gt; I'm not necessarily going to divorce him.

Take it from one victim of emotional abuse to another, this is exactly what you need to do. You need to divorce him.

&gt; He's never hit me or physically abused me

He still might, but even if he never does, emotional abuse is grounds enough to leave him.

&gt; he's a very good man when we're not arguing.

No, he is not a good man. You only get the ""good"" man, when you fit his definition of who you are supposed to be. His actions show exactly who he is. Please stop making excuses for him. You need to look at the whole, not cherry pick the good moments.

---

IMO, you should just file for divorce. This will make it clear that you are done and not moving with him. It will also make the divorce easier for you, because it will be in the jurisdiction you live in. He'll have to travel back for court dates (if any).

I've been where you are. You still want to believe that he is good and that you can have the perfect relationship you felt you originally had. You want to believe that if you just talk to him reasonably, he'll get it and he will change.

He won't.

If you really want to prove this with himself, you need to stop enabling bad behavior. Do not accept the silent treatment. Call him out for acting like a teenager whenever he engages in it. If he yells at you, calmly ask him stop. If he doesn't, just get up and leave. This is hard work, but it will show you exactly who he is. (Note: it will make things worse. If he is a good man, eventually, things might get better. He is not a good man.)

---

If you still want to confront him directly...

Are you in a single consent recording state? If so, go to Best Buy and buy a pocket voice recorder. Then asap, tell him that the two of you need to talk with the recorder going. (Otherwise, talk to him without a recorder.)

Explain to him that you have realized that you feel like he is emotionally abusing you. Site specific patterns. Explain that such things are not normal in healthy relationships. He will try to take over the conversation and blame you for all of it. Stop him and point out that this too is indicative of the problem. Then explain to him that you need time apart to get your head on straight, so you won't be moving with him.

This is not a conversation. You are informing him of how you feel and what you have decided. You can give him a chance to say his piece, but do not engage in a debate. ""Thank you for sharing that, I have a lot to think about"" and end the conversation.

If he starts to yell, just get up and leave. If he touches you aggressively and tries to prevent you from leaving, warn him to get his hands off of you. Then call the cops. (Note the iPhone has a feature where if you hit the side power button repeatedly, it will call 911 for you, look it up. This way, you can do it in your pocket and he won't know.)

PM me if you want more personal advice.

I dealt with a similar situation. Please heed my advice."
234,"&gt; I assured him that I support everything that he does in his life and find him to be an inspiring person and that I could certainly honor that space that he needs. 

You literally just gave him the OK to half-ass this relationship. 

&gt; He told me that if that's the case, then I can call him his boyfriend. 

What an honour!"
235,"What does she say when you point out its not her place to feel obliged because shes not the one looking after the baby, you are?"
236,"If it's been 5 years and her cheating is ""still fresh"", I'd say therapy isn't working."
237,"Something VERY similar happened to me. Its sucked, hard. I was very awkward around them, but honestly, I just needed time. Time to move on from my feelings for him, time to make new friends just so I didnt have to be around them all the time, and time to see how great for each other they were. I was actually in their wedding, and now the 3 of us are super tight, but id be lying if I said it was easy. It was however, totally worth it. I talked about it to people who were outside the situation, and that helped. VERY glad I never brought it up to either of them!!!!"
238,"1000x this. If you ever find it necessary to have a discussion with a third party about the boundaries between them and your partner, you should be asking yourself first, why am I doing this and not my partner? And second, if I’m doing his because my partner won’t, should I be questioning my relationship? Spoiler alert, the answer to the last one is yes."
239,"What makes you think she going to want to come around for a very long time? This was a very bad ""meet the family"" situation. 

I would recommend a small dinner with you guys and your parents."
240,"Totally! 

What a tactless thing to say but especially in a group setting in front of someone's new partner. Who wouldn't be humiliated in that circumstance?"
241,Also record the conversation on your phone OP
242,"Do you live together? This is a complicated situation, but I can comment on the general tone of your post, which seems to move awfully fast to you quitting your job. I would slow down and remember that there are many, many ways to handle this. Primarily, you should absolutely not quit your job, and the baby needs to go to daycare. That will make the whole transition more manageable for all three of you.

From there, you can get to know the child like you would in any other relationship where a boyfriend already has one. It's okay to figure this out as you go.

Counseling is good, but is always jumped to awfully quickly in this sub. If you're communicating and working through your feelings well, it's not absolutely necessary, but if you need help with that, then go for it.

Good luck!"
243,"This is not worth salvaging. He is a drunk cheater who prioritizes himself over you and your child.

He doesn't care. You can't drag this relationship into something salvageable by yourself."
244,"There's 1000 posts a day on ""how do I not feel X emotion."" An answer doesn't exist. You feel what you feel and you get on with it. Reframe your thoughts until you've made peace to the point of not thinking about it so much.

&gt; Most of these people are friends from school that I hardly see anymore and would've needed to travel. 

It's not clear by your structure if you are saying this about your wedding or the friend's wedding. However, if you mean your wedding, then use that to adjust your frame. It's not realistic to expect grown ups, with responsibilities, to travel for someone they aren't that involved with daily. That's your reframe focal point. They've done nothing wrong and neither have you. Life is just what it is."
245,"“Mom? She has abused me and used me as her punching bag my whole life. You seem to think that because we both came out of the same uterus, I should accept that abuse.  That’s not how it works. You telling me I should just be nice to her validates her awfulness and gives her permission to treat me like garbage. You should be standing up for me, not defending her. I will not discuss this again.”"
246,"OP, your cousin is a 26 year old adult. It is not your fault that he is a shithead and he is not your responsibility. Do you feel like anyone ""made"" you the person you are today? Of course you had support, but would that support have mattered if you didn't make the right choices with your life?"
247,I don't think he's that into you. I think you are going to get badly hurt by this guy.
248,Does she like your boyfriend?  I kinda think she does.  Tell your boyfriend to be careful.  I could see this turning ugly if she tries without telling you.
249,"Thou shalt not take thy uninvited and unfit for human society girlfriend to your sister’s graduation. 

Nor shalt thou skippeth thy sister’s graduation because thy uncivil girlfriend hast alienated thy mother and father and thou fearest her great and terrible wrath, as thou is as a worm.

Here endeth the sermon. Go in peace."
250,"I definitely think based on this comment alone that you need to give him more space. You can order multiple pizzas from a chain restaurant an hour or two before a party, and they will still show up that night and be relatively cheap.   


Ordering them days ahead of time and searching for the lowest cost in the area and having a family member pick up instead of getting delivery are all nonessential to planning a birthday party. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear from this comment that you have much higher expectations for planning and administrative tasks than he does. You need to sit back, let him do things his way, and let him deal with the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

You didn't even let him fail. All you did was demonstrate to him that you didn't think he was capable of such a trivial task as ordering pizza by delegating it to him and then taking over the task yourself when he didn't do it right away exactly as you expected.  


I also don't think forgetting an oil change for a few months or forgetting a $29 credit card balance are horrible failures. They are normal human errors. Yeah, they might have some negative consequences, but it's not the end of the world. At the end of the day, your husband is focusing on things that truly matter, like his career and investing in the lives of the kids he teaches/coaches. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think you are way too afraid to fail and too afraid that someone in your family will ""fail."" As someone who has worked through similar issues in therapy, I think you should talk to your individual therapist about this more. It's not that your husband can't manage household tasks. It's that he can't manage them perfectly, and that's disappointing to you.  


Seriously there are a million more things in the world to get divorced over. None of the things you mentioned are even in the realm of good reasons."
251,"&gt;He argued that it should make me feel safe, and that it was really hurtful of me to act like he's being creepy or threatening.

*Yuck*. Beyond the size difference thing, you're telling him that something he's doing bothers you, and his response is to tell you how you *should* feel instead. That's bad.

Do not let him turn this around on you. His behaviour is new and it's unwelcome. However he thinks it ""should"" make you feel, you've told him how it *does* make you feel. Either he cuts it out, or you know he wants you to feel that way (or is fine with creeping you out and making you feel unsafe so he can feel big and strong and protective)."
252,Either that or he's purposely trying to fatten her up because he's got a fetish and he's being abusive about it instead of being honest because she might just leave him.
253,"He's demonstrating on an active basis that she is more important to him than you. Period. 

Leave this loser."
254,Discuss this in therapy
255,"You don’t really need to do anything. It’s his problem and he needs to work on it. If he accepts that you need the dog and that going out together is a thing you will do and he just feels awkward then that’s fine. He will live with feeling awkward.

 If he’s trying to avoid going places with you then he’s being kind of a jerk and you should let him know he’s being a jerk and hope he gets it together."
256,"I was not sure until this:  

&gt;Every time I feel like I'm making forward progress, he contacts me with more news of how terrible it's going for him. It sets me back cause I still care for him  

Just clear. Him in your life does harm. Simple as that. You need to get better yourself first. He is not your responsability.  

If you were emotionally indiferent to his presence, then I would say there's nothing wrong with being a friend, but this is not the case.  

Tell him to talk to someone else."
257,Nope. Don’t host them. This will not end well and this may end your friendship. You will bend over backwards and spend hundreds so she can spend two weeks having sex with her boyfriend on your bed. Tell them your boyfriends landlord somehow found out about the cats and is putting his foot down.
258,"It sounds like you're both internalizing the behavior of others. This is the first thing you both should work on. For the most part, people aren't against each other as much as they're for themselves. So, with that in mind, most people aren't concerned that the other people in their lives need their value shown to them.

Know your own value, both of you. Be comfortable with that without validation from others.

Early 30's is not old, but there's a definite ""curse of being grownups"" factor that can be a nasty social obstacle. The only thing you can really do is just keep trying new things and meet new people. There's a lot of single-serve friends to go through before you find the people that stick. But if this is important to you, then just grit your teeth and keep trying."
259,"* You need to stop idealizing the idea of ""family.""

* Realize that you have all the power here because you control access to the baby.

I understand that it makes you anxious that I do not currently work, but it is not helpful.  Husband and I have carefully thought this through and our life right now is what works for us and meets our needs.  This is not up for discussion.  If you continue to post job vacancies on Facebook, I will have to block you for awhile.  If you continue to judge our choices, we will have to cut contact for a little bit until everyone is in a better place.  So, how about Local Sportsball Team!""

* And then do that.  The next posting on Fb?  Block them for X number of days.  Each time they push and insist on being ""helpful?""  Their ban gets a day longer.

* Each time they criticize your life?  You give them a warning (""I am not justifying my decisions to you.  Hey, Sportsball Team be sportsballin'!""). If they do not take that seriously (they won't), then remind them of the new rules of communication (""If you will not change the subject, I will have to go.""), followed by, ""Well, since you won't let this go, I guess *I'll* go:  let's try this again in X days.""  And then you hang up or leave.

* Husband needs to cope with this.  It stressed him out?  *Too fucking bad.*  He's a goddamned adult with all the rights and privileges thereof, **so he gets to put on his Big Boy Pants and being dealing with this problem.**  

* You two need counseling.  **Your husband is using you as a meat shield,** and that needs to stop.  Everyone needs to learn about *boundaries,* YOU INCLUDED.  By exposing you to this unnecessary stress, your husband is failing as a spouse.  A couples therapist can help you form a true team here.

* Some individual counseling for your husband.  Stop calling what he is doing ""procrastination,"" and call it what it really is:  **avoidance.**  Do you want your child to grow up doing this?  No?  There's a 50/50 chance he will as long as this remains a compelling example of behavior.  And it *is* compelling:  who wouldn't like to grow up and just dump the icky bits of life into the lap of a woman to lovingly take care of?  **This needs to stop.**

* And yes, if your in-laws won't behave, then they don't get grandchild time.  Yes, your baby will survive if he doesn't see grandma for a few days.  No, you won't be destroying the family.  *Your* baby, *your* rules.  Think of it as advanced parenting training:  you get to experiment with the whole break-the-rules, pay-the-consequences dealio on others before applying it to your child.

* For the rest, gray rock the *shit* out of it.  Look that up.  

I bet it won't take long to get compliance, however grudgingly."
260,Find someone that will treat you the way you deserve. This person apparently has no interest in doing so.
261,"Or not mention it at all, if he's really so removed from their household that he won't notice until Monday morning when he goes to eat breakfast that there's no food in the house then he might finally learn."
262,"Your title is confusing. How is this a semi-unrelated conflict? She is only wanting to meet with you *because* she wants to fuck your husband. That’s the whole reason any of this is happening. Don’t let her confuse you. I would cancel this meeting and talk to your husband instead. The fact that he isn’t *absolutely enraged* about how this woman treats you and talks about you is completely unacceptable. Don’t let her more into your life, that is exactly what she is wants."
263,"&gt;&gt;I was in a relationship for 7 years in which we were fully planning all of that, so at one point, I was ready to do these things with someone else as well

When you start feeling bothered by his past, remind yourself that you have had the same feelings yourself. Also, ask yourself: What is the significance of ""firsts"" to you? If you were both with other partners, presumably you also had sex with those people. Why do the ""firsts"" involved in building a life together bother you more than, say, the ""firsts"" involved in building a sexual relationship together?"
264,"&gt;  About a year ago, she came to our house for a professional event and made several comments about how people with my credentials were not qualified to do the job that we both do. I am quite a bit senior and more successful, objectively, than she is, FWIW. After that incident, I have avoided her. I’ve never been rude or anything, but I don’t go out of my way to talk to her on the 3-ish times a year that I see her.

&gt; She has used this as an excuse to complain about what a meanie I am to many of our colleagues and very frequently to my husband. Like, a lot. Like many many more times (that I know of) than I have actually seen her. So finally, being fed up, I texted her yesterday saying that I had heard that she felt that there was an issue between us, and I would like to clear it up. She thanked me for reaching out, and we are meeting today.

Don’t meet her. She’s not going to back off. If she is truly trying to ruin your reputation and you have proof of it, you should hire a lawyer to get her to stop. 

Your biggest issue is your husband for not shutting this down, and providing a unified front of being civil but distant with her. He’s probably sharing his grievances about you with her too, since she has such a sympathetic ear. Are you more professionally successful than him?"
265,"I think an issue of equal concern is her 
&gt;I hate you and I hate every minute with you

tantrum.

This is extremely immature.

I know everyone's relationship is different but even when I was getting divorced and did hate my ex, I would never say that to them.

Also, OP indicates this lashing out is something that's happened before.  

I'm willing to bet she *has* used money in there for 'not bills' and thinks she's about to be busted."
266,"I'm unsure when I was supposedly trying to sleep with this girl, the only answer I got was recently. The ""informer"" is saying that the girl was telling people this information, so I told my girlfriend to ask the girl for screenshots of our (nonexistent) messages or calls. If she's supposedly telling people she should be happy to share."
267,"She helped him out, she expects him to be forever beholden to her as a result, and he's letting her walk all over him. He'll never be his own man while she lives. Where do you see this in five years? You, your daughter, and maybe a new baby living with her 11 pets and waiting on him to get him home from taking her shopping?! Come, on, lady... you know you need to walk away from this dumpster fire."
268,"I dislike cats due to some prolonged childhood trauma involving them. 

So I don’t date people with cats because when you adopt a cat you take all the full responsibility for an otherwise powerless animal which relies on you for food, shelter and medical care. That’s a serious deal that shouldn’t be compromised for an autonomous person who is not dependent on you. The commitment is to the cat here.

And as a non cat person I don’t trust someone who antagonises them, uses hostile language about them and is generally disrespectful.

I don’t like them but can still be civil to friends’ cats including some light cat sitting, buying treats for a cat as a gift and commiserating when a cat is ill or dies. I don’t swat them off my lap and call them names. I just ignore them and come home and carp about cat hair to myself.

I say keep the cat and re-think a man who treats an animal like an inconvenience."
269,"Firstly, this sounds a little too close to one of my friend's situation. She was really into this nice enough guy; he had some feelings for her but had personal issues preventing him from committing to a relationship. She said that's ok, they do couply things together all the time and that he makes her happy, so she doesn't need more. This went on for 3 years and she became increasingly unhappy with this arrangement; he never did call her his gf, and she had some heart to heart's with him about what she needs and wants in a relationship. Another friend and I sometimes voiced our concerns, but she would assure us that this is how she loves. And I wanted to trust her judgment... He ended things a short while ago by saying that he has a gf.

I'm so angry that he made my friend - one of the smartest people I know - feel this crushed and sad and blindsided in a matter of seconds.

You're not her, and your guy may be completely well-intended. But I just wanted to ask you to always respect your own needs and wants as well as this guy's. If he never shows actual evidence that he's ""digging it,"" and you have to just keep telling yourself that he is, something might be off."
270,"Shit. Not even that. She doesn't get any warnings when he fucks up, so he shouldn't either. Let him wake up Monday realizing they have no breakfast to eat and no clean clothes. He'll (hopefully) figure it out"
271,you stick one foot out from underneath the duvet to cool down a bit and pull it back in when you get too cold. like a normal person.
272,"He sure did. 

And, he told her about me as well. Once he had kissed me goodbye that morning, left me at his place, and got on that plane, he realized that he was in the midst of a massive web of lies and felt like he finally needed to be honest. BooHoo for him...

Even after their conversation, she told him that she thought he was so brave for being honest, begged him to extend the trip, to talk about it, to continue to explore dating one another. 

Moral of the story, don't be that girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let the other women have him. They probably deserve each other anyway."
273,"I would say she took a serious liberty entering her fingerprint without your permission and at such an early stage of the relationship.
Topping that up now with silent treatment is a pretty bad sign as well.

She is demonstrating that she is exactly the kind of person you wouldn't want to give access to your private life like that.

With that in mind, you might want to rethink whether you want this relationship to ""go somewhere""."
274,"&gt;As long as it's not hurting anyone, I really don't care. 

He's hurting you and you're relationship whether you realize this or not.

You know you're never going to get that money back right? I hope, for your sake, your dad snaps out of this because once you grow up more, you're going to realize how fucked up it is to ""borrow"" money from your 15yo kid.

If he doesnt stop, this eventually will destroy your dad's relationship with you and your family.

Tell your mom. This is very serious. He is taking advantage of you."
275,"&gt;  I am really fond of the guy

&gt; My boyfriend of six months is mind-numbingly boring

Ouch. 

At the six months stage, you should still be brimming with excitement for the guy. If you're already feeling frustrated, then this isn't the relationship for you. 

If anyone I was dating said at any point to anyone that I was ""mind-numbingly boring"", I'd dump them on the spot."
276,"Not in military, not the mom, but wow!!!  That hits home for me.  I don' t have that partner.  I am that partner.  I want that partner.

OP you deserve that partner."
277,"Honestly, and with the best of intentions - Have some self-respect. 

You don't sound confident in yourself, and that worries me because you come across as someone who will accept less than they deserve. He has set you up for a fall by hedging this situation on low expectations, and it sounds like you won't viably be able to complain about it or ever expect more. 

He's not that into you, and it's possible he just let you call him your boyfriend so he can keep the sweet, low-effort situation he has going without you backing off."
278,"It might just be his true self coming out.  Im sorry,i knkw it's difficult to hear. 

Others have already commented on the ridiculousness of his comments/wish list. 

My advice to you is, if you don't want what he wants, then you are not compatible. You will find someone who you are compatible with. Don't settle, you deserve better."
279,"Also a military spouse and a former service member, adding there are resources available to you and your husband, at little to no cost. Military OneSource is a fantastic starting place. 

One of things I spent the most time on as a commander were domestic issues between my soldiers and their spouses. Deployments are hard on everyone. They are not an excuse to treat your spouse poorly. 

In my own relationship with my husband, any time he has tried this line of “well, this is what I’d do,” I tell him “great. You can do it when you’re here, until then it’s my way.” (BTW, he does it my way too because baby is used to my way)."
280,"This is a really great point. In her mind, by calling this meeting you’re validating her belief that you’ve done something wrong; she’ll be expecting an apology that obviously is unjustified and you won’t give. She’ll then use that lack of apology as an opportunity to create more drama and *whatever* you do or say will be spun into a narrative against you. You’re going with the hope of ending the drama and her badmouthing you, but she’s going with the exact opposite aim. 

I really strongly advise that you don’t have this meeting. Literally anything you do will be manipulated against you; I can see no way in which this makes things better for you. I honestly think the only way to deal with her is to rise above it and make your husband step up to the plate. The fact that he won’t shut her down when she says bad things about you or calls late at night is very concerning and that’s the real problem here; you need to be sitting down with your husband to try and fix this. Speaking with this woman will not sort out the underlying issue that your husband is behaving deeply inappropriately. I’m sorry you’re in such a difficult position and I hope things improve."
281,"I apologize for the expletive, but what a fucking coward.

Your first move should be to research and then call a divorce attorney in your state. Find a few that offer a free initial consultation and meet with them to see which one you like best and go from there. 
 
Please do not try and navigate this without the support of counsel. 

&gt;We have a child, and I can barely afford to support myself alone, much less a child

I'm so sorry he's done this, but this is why both child and spousal support exist. 

I wish you nothing but the best."
282,"Divorce, for one, is a very real option. By the look of your post history, one that has been on the table for a little while... 

Less severe: Boundaries. Boundaries are not about changing him (you can't do that). Boundaries are about changing yourself and your own actions so you are less miserable and conflicted. Refusing to buy food that makes you miserable is fine. He is a grown-up person and has options for accessing these things if he wants them. If something leaves you feeling unhappy and like you are enabling his self-harm, stop doing that thing.  

And counselling. For you, not for you both as a couple. Just you. So you can start to figure out what actions you can take that will give you the most peace and you can find a more firm position about what you are willing to accept or take responsibility for, and what you are not."
283,"Immature AND controlling. OP, by giving you the silent treatment, she's punishing you for not giving her what she wants. That's a big red flag."
284,"I had already moved on to another post and came back to comment when the ""six"" finally registered"
285,"Well I'm sorry to hear that about the relationship but I'm glad you got out. The joint bank account kinda worries me and it should worry you too. I don't know how they work there but in the states I think anyone on the account can drain it. I'd take her off that account or just leave her some money in it and put the rest in a separate, single account under your name."
286,"Forensic pathology? Medical examiner? Probably a few different terms for that.

Anyway, your sister is right. This should be mentioned to your mom, though she should have mentioned it already. Stop giving him money, that's money you won't get back, besides, you have your own interests and needs right now and shouldn't be funding his. Tell him no. Tell him to stop asking. If he's running down his savings though lack of good judgment, don't throw your own money into that pit as well. A child can't fund an adult's life and shouldn't be asked to."
287,You get slightly drunk and then insult people's clothes and make racist comments about strangers' voices. That is super inappropriate and embarrassing and maybe you should try and do better.
288,"Why are being such a doormat in all of these situations, though? You've set the standard that you will do absolutely anything he wants you to, so are you really surprised he's taking advantage of that? I can't believe you left a friend's wedding early so you could drive him and her around ... Not only a lack of respect for yourself, but you will literally disrespect other people to make him happy when he treats you like a last priority."
289,"If he doesn't know if he wants to marry you after 9 years together, then IMO, he never will. The fact that he doesn't want to even have this discussion is a sign that he's not interested in marrying you IMO. If he was, then why avoid the discussion? If marriage is a goal you have in life, it may not be with this guy. How can you build a life with someone you can't even communicate with when it comes to important questions in life?

OP, he doesn't want to marry you. Do with that information what you will."
290,And isn't it convenient that she can call up an emergency to disrupt planned celebrations that don't include her?   It's almost like some kind of weird mommy thing he has going.
291,"Yeah, I’m not down with this. I used to be in a relationship where I tried to change my boyfriend’s style because I found it unattractive and it was just a bad deal all around. Totally my fault. And now I’m dating the *right* person for me, and I don’t give a shit what he wears, he’s sexy in everything, and we’re getting married next year.

Tell him either he accepts you as you are or kick rocks."
292," &gt;will not talk to me with any ounce of respect until I start to respect him aka send nudes. 

Girl he just told you that he inherently doesn't respect women. Sending him nudes just tells him he will be rewarded for tearing you down.  He is basically  negging you into being the bang maid he apparently feels entitled to.

Whether he is having a mental episode or is revealing his true colors, I wouldn't stick around because he has made it clear that either way, you are his punching bag."
293,"&gt; Ok, so I'm an atheist but i feel like I gotta add that the people you were around were toxic. Not a representation of the religion itself. 

I've been around lots of other groups in lots of other churches in several different cities, so I know not all are toxic, however at this point in my life, I can't stand to expose my children (or myself, frankly) to the unknowns of this kind of environment."
294,"You have more than enough boundaries with your friend, in fact this is extreme. You alert your boyfriend if this guy so much as looks at you even though there's no sign he's interested. Your boyfriend sounds insecure and controlling if he's throwing a fit over this. 

  
P.S. It's too late for this now, but dealing with the compliant about your ex through someone you consider a friend is a poor idea. That's a bit of conflicting interests for him (trusting to keep your confidence for his job, but he's also friends with you and your boyfriend)."
295,"&gt; For example, we hosted a get together at home for his players, and he ordered the food, cleaned before, coordinated times, organized games, everything. But for anything outside of work, he simply will not do!


Right because his home life is not important than his work life. He can order pizza for his two year old daughter's, but it's just not important to him. 


&gt; she kept insisting to me that I should let the system fail when he's supposed to be responsible for tasks. But who is going to fix the chaos that ensues??


He has to fix the chaos. As long as it's nothing actually life threatening (ie child vaccinations), he's an adult and he can fix his own messes. Because if there's no consequences for his irresponsibility, there's no reason to change, everything is working great for him. If his car breaks down because of a missing oil change he has to walk to work. If the credit cards are revoked because he didn't pay the bill, he has to get a second job. If he didn't order the pizza for the party, it's on him to tell the guests he screwed up."
296,"Yeah. I have curly hair 3b and dudes have NO CLUE how much time, effort, and money is spent keeping it healthy and styled. One guy asked me, “why don’t you just straighten it everyday?” Well, gee, probably because it takes 45 minutes and permanently damages/dries my hair out like crazy, mmmkay?  Other dudes think I just roll out of bed in the morning with flawless curls. Nope.

Wear your hair however YOU want."
297,"None of this sounds good, literally nothing here is healthy.

* Telling other girls he loves them should be a hard pass, momentary weakness or not.

* Angling to make you mad or jealous by doing things with other women is awful, who the hell does that besides teenagers?

* Controlling or even have strong opinions about appearance/makeup/hair is a hard pass.  My body my rules. I make exceptions when an SO gives me tips about whether my hair is a mess or makeup smudged, but unsolicited advice is a good way to get me to ghost a fool.

Not even taking into account the obvious communication disconnect - lack of boundaries, differing expectations, etc - this ""relationship"" sounds bonkers.  You're feeling driven to snoop his accounts (bad plan, you know that) because you can't trust this guy to do anything other than tear you down and hug his coworkers. 

This doesn't sound like a case of an overly-friendly guy being misunderstood. He literally is trying to upset you.  I'd get out as fast as possible, it's only going to get worse from here."
298,"If you can’t deal with them and your fiancée won’t lessen contact or accept that you need no contact with them, no, it’s not stupid to refuse to put yourself in that situation. I think it’s going to be be rough, but I also think you can do better for yourself than someone who demands you let their family abuse you as the price of being with them."
299,"Oh that's what I was, a couch with some super convenient holes in it..."

Using jealousy and envy as a sign of love and to keep you from being with others

Coercing you into spending all of your time together

Controlling the finances"
301,"This. Why on Earth would you push your husband to hang out with this girl when she’s treating you like that? Why would you expect him to have your back when you don’t have your own? Sorry but you’re sending mixed signals. I would suggest not encouraging him to see her, see how that goes, if it continues then tell him what another commenter said about “You’re my life partner if someone is disrespectful I would expect you to shut it down”."
302,"Trust me when I say that a guy that makes you wait for fifteen minutes on a dark street when he could invite you in is not worth his salt. You should be with a guy who is proud to show you off to his family and friends. That's what you deserve.

I would break it off with him. Someone acting this shady has without a doubt several secrets you don't want to know about. This is merely the tip of the iceberg."
303,"I wouldn't want to be with someone who thinks of me as ""mind-numbingly boring."" Do him a favor and break up with him."
304,"Kid's are a lot more resilient than you think. Your daughter will also probably blossom when away from her mom, because she will be living in a much safer, stable environment, instead of one dictated by fear.

Get her therapy.

If she does ask for her mom, explain to her that her mom has been behaving in ways that not good and so she won't be able to see her for a while. Deep down, she already knows her mom has been acting wrong."
305,"This: 

&gt;  Do l have the right to force my roommates to live with BF?

Is the one the most infuriating things I've read on this sub. I really hope the roommates have a lease that limits guests to a handful of nights and they can boot him out the day he exceeds it."
306,"Uhmmm, you guys are married. That means *you* are priority over her family. She needs to let her family know that they can either accept her wife, or she will have to decline holiday invitations. When they call you ""co-dependent"" that's just another way of saying ""we don't take your relationship seriously - this is a phase you'll grow out of.""

Protecting their feelings is not your wife's responsibility."
307,"That's true too. I guess she knew I was home because I practically slammed the door in her face. But if she just assumed the following time, then it would be dangerous. I suppose the only way to do it is to call her and tell her that I don't plan on being home any mornings for the next few weeks, which should force her to look for an alternate solution. Just crazy to think I essentially have to hide from my own house because of this."
308,"&gt;I'm pretty miserable

Don't double down on a mistake because you spent a long time making it. You don't even have to view this as a mistake; just a relationship that has run its course. Don't stay involved with anyone who hurts you intentionally. Love isn't enough for a healthy relationship. 

Do look after yourself. Wishing you the best."
309,Things will only get worse once they're living together
310,Don't buy a house with him until you figure this out!
311,"I think it’s also really common for people with her history of emotional abuse to expect any situation where someone is unhappy with them to escalate in the same way. So the situation with you, especially if it was over text, may have spiraled in her mind to “OP and her husband are furious with me” even if that’s not what you said. 

It’s not fair to you, but I think in her current circumstances she’s not really capable of being an equal friend right now, so it’s up to you to draw boundaries around what you’re able to give and how emotionally invested you can be. I do think if you’re able to protect your own well-being but also be a trustworthy friend that can counteract the messages she’s getting from family and her boyfriend, you’d be doing her an invaluable service, and I hope one day she’s able to break away from those patterns."
312,These are some pretty immature games for a 40-year old to be playing
313,I am sitting here crying my eyes out. I could have written your first post. And I’m petrified that in the near future I could be writing this very same update. Loving my boyfriend hurts. Fuck 💔
314,"&gt;In comparison to my measly $35 per week in spending money, **he has about $300 per week to blow.**

Is this for real? Like, no exaggeration,  he has $300 per week in surplus funds? That's $16,000 per year that could go toward retirement, or a downpayment on a house, or childcare expenses. Is he saving *any money* toward goals like this?

It would irritate me so much to hear someone complain about living paycheck to paycheck knowing that they have $1,200 every month that they can spend on **whatever they want.** At that point, if you're living ""paycheck to paycheck"" then it's a goddamn choice. Save up for 6 weeks and then you won't be living paycheck to paycheck anymore!!"
315,"My Boyfriend always got too hot while sleeping, especially with me beside him, but I'm a cuddle bug. We came up with our solution quite by accident.

I had a double bed when I moved into my place, which was very crowded for the two of us and our 2 80lb+ dogs. When he moved in, he brought his double bed with him. We pushed them together and now we each have our own bed. I hated the idea at first, but now I can't imagine it any other way.

He gets his light sheets and he can toss and turn all he likes. I have my thick blankets and don't move all night. We usually cuddle in one bed or the other for a while, but we usually fall asleep holding hands between our beds.

\- beds are pushed right together so there is no space

\- each person gets the mattress they want

\- no motion transfer

\- can still have all the cuddles 

Hopefully, you guys can find something that works for you, too!"
316," the fact that she actually abandoned her newborn baby on your porch was your first sign to contact child services. I understand that she's your wife's best friend but that's not someone with good judgment of being a parent.

If it weren't for the fact that she's okay with putting her baby in such a dangerous situation, I'd suggest you leave the house to work in a library or coffee shop for a few days, too. Instead, consider just not answering the door and calling the authorities if she ever does that again. Her baby is not your responsibility but there is no way you can all be okay with a person who does that, especially to an infant. So, please stop enabling it and do the actual right thing."
317,"You mean your *ex-*boyfriend, right?"
318,"&gt; what are all these 30yr old dudes doing hanging around 20yr old young women? and the way he calls you a liar and that it ""changed the way he saw [you]"" - this is about more than faces. when you're in your mid to late 20s and look back on this, you'll be dismayed that you thought this sort of treatment was normal or ok. he doesn't want a woman on equal footing with him, because they wouldn't put up with this sort of thing.

THIS, OP. And you said he started dating you when you were a freshman? So, you were 18 and he was 26? 

Is he demanding you ""prove"" your trustworthiness to him somehow? Is he saying things like he'll forgive you, but only if you do X, Y, and Z? 

Drop the rope, OP. He wants you to chase after him, begging him for forgiveness. What would happen if you shrugged and told him calmly ""I've told you the truth. If you don't believe me, that's not my problem."" And then went on living your life, and refusing to feel guilty about it? Because you have *nothing* to feel guilty about."
319,"I was sympathetic to your bf right up until he put hands on you. I'll respond in the general, then in the specific.

Many men don't know how to sit with their emotions. Many of us don't find crying cathartic and have been socialized within a more narrow band of emotions. If I cry in front of a male friend they will make fun of me and we'll both feel relieved when I laugh. Many men would do well to expand their emotional range. I would rather bloody my hand against a brick wall than feel too much sadness. I've been socialized how to turn sadness into rage. Through my twenties I could hold three jobs while going to school full-time because I was always angry. I didn't know how to invoke a feeling of acceptance from my loneliness, just anger at perceived unfairness. It's a problem I -- and many men -- need to work out because it essentially outsources emotional labour to our loved ones.

Now specifically in the case of your boyfriend, he would rather become physical than deal with the feelings your tears evoke. That's not okay and a massive read flag. Beyond having the narrow emotional range -- which many men have -- his poor coping mechanisms are far enough gone that he's okay putting his hands on you.

He's 21 and being tired is enough of a trigger for him to be physical. He will experience more stress than this in life. He will not react well. Your bf needs counseling. Then, depending on what his therapist says, the two of you may need a few joint sessions to communicate some boundaries.

Finally, it's not lost on me that you were probably annoying him. (Having to deal with a drunk while waking up would suck). He needs to be able to express that to you in words."
320,"This is a classic case for pre-marital counselling. 

You can thrash out this and all kinds of similar issues in a safe environment with an experienced mediator. Pre-marital counselling is such a good idea. It doesn't mean the relationship is broken - it's preventitive maintenance, it's a pre-flight safety check.

In the counselling you can each discuss what your own ideas, expectations, fears, prejudices, preconceptions, views etc of marriage ARE - and hopefully come to some compromise or agreement."
321,He left you in his home to take the side chick on a vacation? The motherfucking nerve...
322,"&gt;As long as it doesn't put your kid in actual danger, let there be chaos..

Exactly. If his engine burns out because he can't be bothered to get the oil changed, that's on him and he needs to fix it. If he has no clothes to wear to work because he hasn't done his laundry, so be it. Basically, anything that won't hurt the kids in the immediate future (like lack of groceries or care), let him suffer. 

Yeah, it might suck for OP too as she's collateral damage, like if they want to remodel their home but can't get a loan because hubby has shit credit due to nonpayment, but unfortunately, that might have to be reality.....He will never change if OP keeps following behind him and cleaning up his messes."
323,"Have you talked about a short term living arrangement? Where the two of you rent an apartment, and whoever has the kids stays in the house and other person stays in the apartment. It doesn't uproot the kids yet and gives some transition time to figure things out. A colleague of mine did this, and while it was odd to share the living spaces it worked for them and their two kids until they determined assets and finalized everything. It's not the cleanest solution, but it was very reassuring to the kids during this time. I'm sorry you're going through this. Please remember to not do anything out of spite for her, as it could hurt the kiddos."
324,"Have you clearly said that you're not looking for work? Reply to every tag with something like
""I'm not looking for a job but thanks"" escalating to
""Why have you tagged me?"" Be very very clear

Also ask your husband to address this with his parents. He should be dealing with this on your behalf."
325,Don't put up with someone who calls you shit names when angry either! HUGE RED FLAG.
326,I would reconsider your stance on this. It’s clearly eating away at your father and he’s clearly done a whole lot for you over the years. You already know the answer but for some reason he can’t accept it without seeing the irrefutable proof. I don’t see the harm in letting him have that
327,This all sounds pretty innocuous and the idea that you're going to get her to drastically change annoying but harmless behavior is not realistic.  You make it sound like you're regularly around her for more than 24 hours at a time and that's likely the problem.  There are plenty of people who I love but whom I'm going to get annoyed with if I spend that much time with them without a break.
328,"Yes! u/dca_user, it's extremely alarming to me that:

* Your parents are continually pressuring you to co-sign loan documents **for them**.
* You have no idea why you are perpetually broke.
* Your parents have your bank account and routing number.

First things first, please go to your bank and review your transaction history at least over the past few months. See if there are any withdrawals you didn't authorize. I'm not saying your parents are doing this, but we've all heard stories of unscrupulous parents in need of cash who turn to ""acquiring"" (i.e., stealing) it from their unsuspecting children.

Second, regardless of what you find, stop stressing out about repaying your parents. You have no moral obligation to do so, as (I presume) they never told you that the $50-100 deposits they gave you were loans that you needed to repay. Moreover, you simply don't have the financial resources at this time to repay their gifts. So don't. Don't put yourself out on the street or take out loans in order to repay your parents' past gifts."
329,"So your bf isn't gaslighting you- he's purposely trying to make you feel bad by hitting on other women. He's probably cheating on you as well. Gaslighting is when someone tries to trick you into thinking you are crazy. Your bf isnt being as subtle- hes clearly trying to mess with you because he does not care about you and is a bad, manipulative person. Please immediately leave this relationship"
330,"A devil's advocate argument is this situation is mirroring something her parents did and that triggers her. This isn't about the boyfriend but the damage the parents did that caused her to ""run"" from them in the first place. Still, you're right she doesn't want a shared account...she wants money put in HER account. She needs therapy."
331,"Dumping this guy isn’t necessarily bad news, many people don’t find out their SO is incompatible until they already have kids or are heavily invested in each other.

You were handed this info on a silver platter, that’s really helpful (even if it hurts for now)"
332,"That’s not something you want to surprise people with. Go ahead and have it in your pictures, then if you get hits you know there’re honest"
333,"Sure, reputational damage and judgement by others is certainly a negative outcome.  But like you said, why would they need to know?  Your wife is from another country and I assume is many years removed from her past - realistically no one would know unless you or she disclosed the fact, and you both have strong motivations to not do that!

Don't discount the cultural baggage most of us carry around surrounding prostitutes and ""dirty women"" as you reflect on your feelings.  Our art, religion, media, politics, and pornography are all filled with implicit assumptions and attitudes about prostitutes that are likely incompatible with our explicit moral beliefs if we sat and thought about it.  We have endless sympathy for, say, African slaves forced to work on plantations - we don't hold them morally responsible for their situation and instead blame the system that transported, enslaved, and exploited them, and killed them if they didn't comply.  But we have a cultural blindspot when it comes to women and prostitution, even if the facts of their lives and circumstances aren't so different from others we feel more sympathy from.  You're not a bad person for holding these unexamined biases, any more than you're a bad person for being a native English speaker because you grew up in a context and culture that emphasized learning and speaking it.  Disgust and hate against prostitutes is part of our cultural DNA, from Mary Magdalene to the titles of the videos on pornhub.  But just as you can learn other languages with effort and study, you can learn other ways to think about things you grew up never questioning.  Unlike most people, though, for you that process is suddenly a lot more urgent and practical than it has ever been before."
334,"To me it sounds like she's handed you an ultimatum that is heavily weighted in her favor which has no place in a healthy relationship. Your parents are right, you don't have to support her full-time for her passion that has a dubious financial pay out at the end. To me it sounds like you've supported her quite a bit already.

Sorry man, she burned this relationship to the ground in order to... well I'm not sure what she gets out of this."
335,"I think the best thing to do is ask for a meeting with your teacher and tell them what you’re dealing with. Show them the texts you get in class. Ask your teacher what to do, how to ask your mom if you can get counseling. Lean on another adult in this situation.

You can do this. Your feelings are valid. You just need to track down an adult who can help you get a family therapist to teach 1) you that it’s okay to not be perfect and you aren’t afraid of failure—you’re afraid of your mom retaliating and 2) your mom how to not instill this fear in you and how to be a supportive parent.

So step 1: find an adult to help you tell your mom you need therapy 

Step 2: find therapist; update a different adult who your mom is accountable to about your progress, like a grandparent"
336,"I agree completely that legally you are an adult, that the laptop is your property, your privacy is being violated, and that gifts should not have strings.

That all being said, I do recommend taking a number of security precautions when meeting someone from online for the first time, and including your dad and step mom when setting them up.

I suggest giving them details of when/where you're meeting, hopefully in public. Send them a picture of the guy and his driver's license/ID card after you meet. Have regular check in times, so they know you're okay and a plan in place for what they do if you don't.

(If that sounds a little over the top it's exactly what a lot of female friends do for each other when meeting a new date.)

It's a little concerning that you refer to someone you've never met before a your boyfriend, and I can see how your parents would be worried, even if they are expressing it inappropriately by violating your privacy."
337,It’s gotten to the point where I wonder when the next incident will happen. I know this isn’t a healthy way to live and I do feel disrespected.
338,"You enjoy the adventure he provides, but he doesn't appreciate your structure the way you thought he did. He feels stifled. Now he's doing all this shit because he wants out but doesn't have the courage to break up, or he's not self-aware enough to understand that's what he wants.

Don't go down the road of playing his sex games. You'll only feel bad about yourself and he's only trying to indulge his fantasies. Which aren't even his, to be honest. They're internet porn fantasies. 

At least you can be glad you weren't the one who moved to a new state for this."
339,You sound like you could benefit from therapy OP. Is it available to you?
340,"I would find it very off-putting if a dude wanted to date me and a short time later began having ""preferences"" about my self-presentation."
341,"My ex was the same with the whole Facebook thing. I met his friends and family etc, but apparently showing he had a girlfriend on Facebook kinda botched his chances with the Tinder-girls he was hiding me from."
342,"TBH ""run away"" sounds like your best bet. 

He's clearly decided to prioritize his family over you and over your joint future, and I don't see anything or anyone changing ever. They are all set in their ways. Bummer."
343,"the fear you have in telling your husband is very sad. the fact that you dont have a partner to lean on in times of stress is awful. when your husband comes back it would be really really helpful if you guys went to counselling. you dont deserve how you are being treated. 
if i was in your position i would tell him your child bumped his head and will be fine. i would not use the world fractured. 
i also would not paint the picture that i was somehow negligent and thats why the baby hit his head. the baby hit his head, as babies sometimes do and he will be fine. 
when your husband gets home please get help with your relationship. you are raising the kids alone and dont need any more shit from someone who isnt even there to help. ok?"
344,"I’m so sorry to hear about your dad. 

It’s normal to sometimes feel numb and empty for a while instead of what you consider “sad”. Over the next weeks and months you’ll feel all kinds of emotions and it may be scary like a roller coaster, but that’s normal too. 

Your mom and sister are grieving too and it may be hard for your mom to garner the strength to be there for you losing your dad, because she just lost her life partner, but if you’re really hurting it’s ok to ask mom for emotional support or if she can help you find a grief counselor to speak with. Hopefully your family can all be there for each other during this difficult time."
345,"Judging by your responses to anyone who is giving you advice about waiting it out, your mind seems pretty set on breaking up with your BF. It doesn’t need to be fair but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to hurt him."
346,"You dont have money to go out of the country for a trip with your family because the money is already earmarked for something else. 

Live your frugal life. Tell them you're paying your debt first before splurging."
347,"Your sister's idea is childish and possibly quite offensive to the boyfriends, but the good news is, you can easily ruin any chance of this happening by telling your boyfriend."
348,"Prepare yourself and your workplace for her scene.   Let the manager and receptionist of your salon know what you mom is capable of so they can make plans to deal with it.   If she refuses to leave when they tell her that you are working and not available for a personal session, go out front and take her out the door.   Let them make the call as to whether to call in reinforcements of some type  

Give them a heads up and plan."
349,"""New phone who dis"" is the way to go here. Don't look back"
350,I'd much rather be the last than the first in any relationship.
351,"Do you know why you deserver everything you have? Because you worked your ass off and built it yourself. Nothing here was handed to you. You did it. And if you were to lose it all (you won't, btw), you have everything it takes to build it right back up.

There is nothing you have posted here that is about your upcoming marriage.

Instead, what you describe sounds like a variation of survivor's guilt. I will reiterate that it is not random luck that allows you to be where you are, while others are still stuck. You did this.

Maybe consider some therapy.

---

For what it's worth. It sounds like you have a good man here and that in spite of your insecurities you are a good woman. You guys also seem to genuinely love each other. Please don't lose that."
352,"She feels obligated to force someone else to do something? Must be nice. Refuse to watch the baby and tell your wife that if she feels obligated, *she* can do it. Give it a day or two and i bet she magically won’t feel obligated anymore."
353,"I have and I have to say it hurts deeply. I'm 38 now and she's 33, but if I don't reach out, she would forget I exist. It's a one-way relationship and it hurts. I've recently let go too. Good luck to you, and if you're looking for a new best girlfriend I'm just a message away. God Bless."
354,"What's the point of ""proving"" it to him? You know he did it, he knows he did it too but is blatantly lying about it instead of trying to fix things with you."
355,What? Go to your sister's graduation. And your parents are right. Your relationship seems pretty toxic.
356,"How were you able to stay married to your wife, and tell her you love her to her face, while sending totally inappropriate texts to another woman?

Compartmentalization."
357,"Based on what you said, it sounds like:

1. The coworker wants your husband to herself and wants you out of the picture.
2. Because of the above, your coworker is engaged in a systematic campaign to attack and undermine you personally and professionally.
3. Your husband should be doing something about this, but doesn't because he doesn't want to stand up to her and because he likes the attention.

Assuming the above is true, I would do your best in today's meeting to keep things as professional as possible and try to limit things to work related stuff. I doubt this will be possible, but I think that's what you should try to do.

I also concur with another comment that if you can record the conversation, you could. It may be key evidence in potential future divorce, tortious interference or employment litigation. But double check your local and state laws.

Because of your husband's lack of action, you have a serious uphill battle and I feel for you.

Out of curiosity, is the coworker married?"
358,...you got your cat a WHAT now?!
359,"So he knew you were stressed about this. He knew that there would be a language barrier. And then he immediately abandoned you when you arrived to take a shower and proceeded to not speak the entire time?

Of COURSE this is worth making an issue of. Your boyfriend behaved appallingly. His actions were beyond inconsiderate. He strung you out to dry and left you with zero support.

Is he normally this socially clueless? Or is this a new thing?"
360,"&gt;  Mike doesn't support me financially, never has, and I have enough savings to put me through study without needing him

He thinks you're going to outgrow him and leave, and is showing it an a very immature way (and possibly a self-fulfilling one). He's worried that he's not needed, and will be needed even less in the future."
361,"Honestly, are you happy in this relationship? Why are you still with someone you can't tell things?

I'm not really sure what can be done here other then don't be married to someone like that. It's unlikely he's going to magically change into a good supportive husband and father. Is he even a good parent? And if he is, he can be a good parent without being married to you."
362,"It’s so important to not burn bridges with people in an abusive relationship. Not to let that isolation happen. 
Otherwise she can feel like she has no one to turn to, no one she can stay the night with. No escape."
363,"So if I'm reading this right she had to turn to prostitution to survive, and you're focusing on the sexual aspect of it. 

Have you thought about why you're focusing on the sex rather than on her struggles? What questions do you have about what happened to her that are making you view this the way you are?"
364,"&gt; He divides the world up into “valuable” and “invaluable” activities, and sees many of the things I enjoy as invaluable. 

To be quite honest I can't even imagine wanting to stay with someone who has this type of black and white view on the world. I'm willing to bet that mindset of his applies to more than just spare time activities, too.   


Why be with someone who judges you for how you spend your free time? He's 28 years old and I reeeally doubt he's suddenly going to change his mentality."
365,Own blankets is really a game changer. I have no idea why everyone shares one!
366,"Nope. He is not entitled to your emotional labor, and if he wanted to reap the benefits of being in a relationship with you (such as on-call moral support), he probably shouldn't have dumped you."
367,"&gt;  ""Uh, any and all of my private conversations?  I'm an adult, I'm allowed to have a private life.  The content of my conversations with others is not your concern.""

I would add at the end something like ""How would you feel if I went through your private personal stuff?"""
368,"Just gonna leave this here.

369,"Yes, he actually was seeing three other women. He said he didn't really use Facebook, and neither did I so I didn't think much of it. I did, however, look at who was liking his pictures on Instagram and was able to see three consistent women. When I looked at their profiles, he was liking every single photo of theirs which seemed odd to me. When I asked him who they were, he dug himself a big ol grave and it was obvious he was lying about something. I thought he was just flirting with them, but months after I ended it the women contacted me and said they ""heard I was dating him too"" and we hashed out the details and all got the same bs story."
370,"&gt; the general consensus is that a boyfriend shouldn’t tell his girlfriend she got fat.

Well yeah, because she already knows it. You don't need to tell her she's gaining weight, trust me she knows already. What you can do is make her understand that your current lifestyles are incompatible and going to cause a separation if something doesn't change."
371,Apparently she’s only supposed to keep the animals for three weeks until a shelter opens for all of them. I don’t believe it though.
372,"Psychotherapist Esther Perel says that going outside of your relationship is not about seeking another person, it’s about seeking another self. (Paraphrased) 
Maybe this issue is more an issue within yourself than with your gf."
373,I wholeheartedly agree with this. This woman clearly has no shame about shit talking and getting in everyone's business. Why give her more material to go off of?
374,"Somone's got issues with their ex. Lol. Don't recycle your problems into shitty advice.

If the same scenario happened to you and you were in the girl's position, thinking you've been cheated on, you would have a similar (or worse reaction - based on your clearly I've-been-hurt-by-someone comment). It would be normal to have that kind of reaction.

Also, people getting busted for cheating often overreact and get mad. Being calm and adult about all this is a much better idea."
375,"UNBELIEVABLE.

You know I browse reddit relationships, and to find this is fucked up. Did you want me to find this?  You are being so untruthful. 

You know full well how this situation went and this is why I bring it up with you about these other girls.  BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME THE SAME COURTESY I GAVE YOU.  The girls you fuck around with, grabbing your 'friend's' tits when I'm not there, slapping your ex's ass when you thought I wasn't there to see it, sitting so close to your girl friend (that has a crush on you) that is naked at the beach with her tits in your face, cuddling up to your other girl friend (who also has a crush on you) so tightly that your touching all while bitching about me half naked on a floaty on the lake.  That's closer than the '5""s' you claim I was to this gay friend.

I listened and talked it out and apologized and heard you out without any interjection!  Never once did I say you were ridiculous for bringing it up.

But when I bring up these other things you've done, you blow me off and have some excuse or jump on me saying that you did it because of something I said or have done.  You have back-handed apologies and so many damn excuses for your behaviour and why it's fine for you to do this and not hear me out and understand why it hurts me!  

You brought this up to me and how it hurt you, I IMMEDIATELY said I was sorry, that it didn't mean anything.  I apologized profusely and listened to how it upset you and talked through it with you without bringing up anything else as to what you have previously done.  As far as I was to understand, we worked this out!!
I was at the beach with him and he was gay, we were getting along and were with a few other friends, we put suntan lotion on each others backs as well as our other friends and he asked if I could put sun tan lotion on his butt cheeks while I was putting it on his lower back.  I felt awkward but did it to not be weird, I regretted it and felt weird as it was a pressure to just do it like it was normal.   I knew you were at the beach, we were texting each other all day and talked while there, I told you he was gay.  I wasn't hiding anything.  It was a mistake and I told you I felt nothing for him and listened to you and let you vent. 

We talked this out almost a year ago and multiple times since and I see you really can't wrap your head around how it actually went and how we talked it out.

What it feels like you're doing is bringing this up to garner some sort of attention for yourself because of our current situation so you can feel better and validated that you haven’t done any wrongdoing and it is all me that is the issue in our relationship. This is so classic from you.

Would you like to also bring up how you don't like bringing me around when you go out because girls treat you different and then still claim that you're not flirting or eliciting behaviours from them that make you feel desired?  Would you like to explain why you don't put me on social media yet all your other girl friends are LOADED on there?  

You comment about how everything I do is fine and everything you do is bad.  Revisit this please, you RIP me apart constantly and your communication with me is deplorable.  I’ve spent too many days apologizing and taking your lashings and hurtful words when you rip on me for situations that do not deserve it and when I ask for you to see how it wasn’t deserved, I barely get an apology for your outlandish actions. 

Your comment stating how hard is it to say - 'sorry, you are right, I shouldn't be touching other mens bodies like that,' IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID TO YOU.  And when I ask for this in return like when you slapped your ex's BARE ass hard at a bikini party (all while not knowing I was there or that I watched it from 15 ft away from you), you defend and give a back-handed sorry IF at all.  
Why the fuck have I spent the last four years of my life putting up with you and these bullshit behaviours?  This is the real question.  

And now YOU have a tough decision to make?? Nice comment thinking that you have to make this decision, maybe you shouldn't be lying and half-truthing situations to others online and god knows who else you talk with.  Sadly this isn't the first time you've hurt me with what you've said online.  I'm such an idiot to have stayed with you.

FYI I am attracted to women."
376,I think it’s also important to note that even trying to accept not being married isn’t fair to you. He has strung you along for so long that I feel you could meet someone that cares for you more and also shares your goals around marriage.
377,"It’s not just him - I think it’s clicking for me that it’s even worse. She was like this before they met and I honestly think this is years and years of multiple people abusing her at least emotionally. I see it in her mom too. I feel really helpless and to be totally honest I feel really guilty for even being upset with her. I think it would really help her to be back in therapy and I’ve mentioned it to her but I might bring it up again as a way for her to help herself out of this situation. Thanks for your reply and I am really happy for you that you are doing a lot better, I hope she can go down that path too!"
378,"""I'd really like to kiss you, but I want you to know something first. I wear dentures, since I lost most of my teeth for medical reasons. You'll probably notice, so I wanted to tell you up front."" 

You can also tell him more if you'd like, but go ahead and tell it like a fact, not like a shameful secret. He'll probably follow your lead."
379,"She says he's wonderful in this post and yet was listing an **very** long list of problems only [two months ago](/r/relationships/comments/apbl9b/were_on_and_off_should_we_stay_off/)

* he got wasted the night before he was going to take her to her uncles funeral
* didn't buy her a birthday or xmas present
* Loud, dirty, messy, and a little gross. 
* Bad at sex, doesn't reciprocate oral
* Has a drink problem

etc"
380,"This is the 100% best answer so far, OP. Very mature and to the point, and will get you out of a situation and into one in which you deserve better treatment anyway."
381,Your dad finds it easier to deal with you than with the headache he married. I would talk back and become an even bigger pain in the ass until he leaves me alone. But I'm vindictive like that.
382,"While probably unrelated, 9 months ago she was still married so there's that. Definitely didn't have time to process everything before this guy showed up."
383,You need to consider getting police and or lawyers involved at this point. Talk to a lawyer and figure out if there's a way you can get a restraining order on him.
384,"Can he work this job for six more months and then start applying to do this role at different companies? Then he will have had ""more experience"" in the role and can possibly find the same job at another company.

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like you two should talk about your five and ten year plans though because if he wants to get a job related to his education eventually and you refuse to move then you guys may not be compatible."
385,I kinda feel like OP is idealizing the family thing a bit and they're starting to take advantage.
386,"You cannot fix her neediness or insecurity.  

If you were sitting with her and sat on your phone texting your friends, would she be ok with that?   Didn’t think so."
387,"So you currently live with your parents? You’re good at being private. How are you at lying?

Your mother has been traumatized by an honor culture that tells her your worth as a person and her worth as a mother is dependent on your lack of engagement in sexual activity. This isn’t news to you, it’s your life. 

You do not owe her any truthful information about yourself that she would weaponize to continue the generational transfer of trauma from her to you. She was treated horribly and she is now treating you as she was treated. You do not have to take part in this. You do not have to give her ammunition.

I would highly advise you to lie, and make an exit plan. Lie to the fullest extent possible. Your relationship is LDR. Great. Tell her you have never done anything in person. Tell her you have never touched each other. Lie and make a plan. Save up the money, find a group house of 20somethings, do whatever it takes to extricate yourself from this environment.

Because if you’re living with her, she will only make the home environment more abusive and emotionally violent for you, if you give her good reason to.

I’m not from a Middle Eastern culture but I am queer and this is how we queers have survived arch-conservative abusers who call themselves parents. Just lie, keep them on an information diet just like you have done, and make a plan to get out as soon as you can.

Once you are safely out, THEN you can decide if you want to attempt a more honest relationship. But prepare to be wholly rejected. If I read the whole thing wrong and you don’t live with her... I would tell you to outward refuse this conversation. Refuse to participate, and take some time for yourself away from family to evaluate what you want to do. And hey, if you do live at home, if you can refuse to talk, go for it. You do not owe her a punching bag.

All my best wishes to you. You deserve love, safety, and parents who are excited for you to be in a good relationship."
388,"OP you need to extricate yourself from this situation as soon as you can. You two have already crossed the line with the confession of your feelings and now she is physically cheating on her husband with someone else. 

There is no way this ends well for anyone involved, including yourself. There is no way you two end up happy together in the end. Repeat that to yourself ad nauseum.

My honest advice is to tell the husband with evidence, then ghost the whole situation. You can find new friends."
389,"It's so effed up that it's up to OP to not be ""nagging"" about something so unacceptable."
390,"I don't know you, but I'm so proud of you both. You were thoughtful, honest, and considerate of each other. You both acknowledged your difficulties and mistakes. You made a civil break out of respect for yourselves, and for the other's welfare. I know it stings a bit right now, but really, you did the right thing and you're both good people. I wish you both all the best in the future."
391,"You likely can't physically stop her trying with any kind of argument, however messed up that is. You can keep it away from her as much as possible, locked up if necessary, but your best bet is simply to have a good, secure password - one she can't guess. Random letters/numbers, don't write it down anywhere. She can try as much as she likes and she'll get nowhere."
392,"Probably his food addiction talking. He’s insecure and projecting because he knows he’s doing something wrong and you’re helping him do the right thing not the easy thing. He’s doing the expected thing and not the honorable thing. Being an ass about it. 

Manipulative? Idk. Definitely an asshole. And one of the most valuable qualities I think is grace. Asking for help with grace. Being graceful to your partner. He’s not going about this with grace. His insecurity is on his sleeve. “Get them before they get me.” Type deal."
393,Maybe it’s not okay with him but he doesn’t want to disappoint you.
394,"It’s been 8 months. Talking about marriage and cohabiting is all well and good. But to move to playing house witg assumptions like “it would be easiest if I took the time off work...” it has been 8 months and this child needs to bond with their father. I’m sorry but there is zero guarantee you’ll be there in a year. He would take the time off. 

Personally I don’t think an 8 month relationship has the foundation needed to navigate this without resentment."
395,"It’s time to leave OP, this kind of inconsiderate behavior is going to get waaaaaaaaaaaay worse"
396,"""The best thing is to re-envision dating your BF as dating a single dad. Because that's effectively what he is: A single dad.""
This. This is not your child, and you've only been dating this man for 8 months. You're taking on way too much shit for literally no reason. If you're comfortable, date the single dad. If you're not comfortable, don't. But don't try to shoehorn yourself into a parental role over a dude you've known less than a year."
397,"Your sister and your dad both *separately* saw the video? If they were together when they watched it, I would assume they mistakenly were looking at someone else’s account.  If they separately saw and told you about the video, I’d be real suspicious of your girlfriend and may even ask to look at her photo roll. Although once you do that you’re relationship is in big trouble"
398,What do you want to bet that these *incredibly* detailed changes are exactly what this woman looks like?
399,"Exactly this. 

He had a month (heck.. MORE since he's been staying rent free for a few weeks) to figure out his housing and I feel like he's living off of you at this point. Your roommates are both paying rent, as are you. Sticking a 4th person into a small apartment who isn't paying is bound to cause issues.  My lease has ONE sentence dedicated to overnight guests.. if someone has an overnight guest stay more than 12 days, that person must be put on the lease or the tenant can be evicted."
400,"You are asking your boyfriend to change who he is. You don't date someone to change them. Either accept this major part of his character, or move on."
401,"&gt;he doesn't want to ""spend time with a lot of strangers who just lost someone."" 

Holy empathy. 

First of all you're engaged, why does he feel like these people are strangers to him?

You shouldn't even need to ask. That's just something people *do* when they're in a relationship. Hot damn."
402,"You: Stop cheating/sexting.

Him: What! This is all your fault! You're wearing the wrong shoes.

You: ...This is my fault. Maybe I'll buy different shoes.

Him: -keeps cheating and sexting-

&amp;#x200B;

Come on, OP. Don't fall for that. That's ridiculous."
403,"If it bothered you then why did you stay afterwards? Yes, it’s strange of her but are you looking for a way out so you won’t feel bad? I guess I have questions for both sides 

Why would she say that? Maybe she was just being who she is? Idk. 

Why did you stay and only now bring it up?

My suggestion for you would be to be stronger with your own self next time so you don’t drag along wasting time for either of you."
404,"$10 isn’t an amount he should get mad over especially if it was an accident. If he doesn’t notice(/care?) OP has little to no spending money while spending lots on himself and she looks after the house and cooks for him she’s a housemaid not a partner... 

Not sure on the dynamics of the area but he could surely look at commuting. Where I’m looking to move to in the city, by moving a 20 minute cycle away living costs (more specifically rent) start to drop dramatically.

By doing a 30 minute train journey you can halve living costs."
405,Write your number on his cup.
406,The bit where you you said he asked you to call his Mom actually made me laugh out loud...
407,"I'm so sorry, OP. Clearly, as you can tell, you wouldn't be leaving your husband over a missed oil change. You would be leaving your husband over his complete and utter refusal to do *anything* to carry his half of the marriage.

You've told him - multiple times - of your concern. You've dragged him off to couples counseling. None of it has helped because he simply couldn't be bothered to care. He couldn't even be bothered to care enough to order pizza for his daughter's birthday party!

Clearly he's *capable* of caring. He cares for his players! Clearly he's *capable* of doing basic household tasks. He did all that to host that party for his team. He just doesn't *want* to contribute, out of sexism, to what he sees as your duty to be the homemaker.

Some posters below raise the possibility that your husband has ADHD. Even if he does, I don't think it helps his case. Folks with ADHD aren't aliens. They might have more trouble focusing and multitasking than the rest of us, but unlike your husband, they aren't going to be completely unconcerned when their spouse and child need them.

Other posters raise the specter of just letting everything fall into chaos. I guess that doesn't hurt to try, but frankly, how immature does a freaking 30-year-old man have to be to *actually* need to see chaos to understand that his not caring has consequences? OP, you've already shown your husband how much his lack of caring has hurt you. He simply doesn't care enough about you to change. That fundamental fact won't change even if you're able to embarrass him into making some gestures at change.

I often push back against r/relationship's advice to break up, but I honestly don't see anything further you can try that you haven't already tried.

Please see a divorce lawyer and start planning for how to separate your lives. If you're currently a stay-at-home parent, start planning for how to reenter the workforce. If there are any credentials you need for the kind of career you'd like to pursue, start working on those right away."
408,"^^^OP READ THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE^^^


Lol yours may not be about a prenup, but it applies.
You deal with your parents, he deals with his. That’s how it’s gotta go. 


It’s much easier to hear harsh truths from a child that from someone who “took away” your child."
409,"I disagree. I have lots of friends on the local police force. If I had troubles with an ex, I’d definitely prefer a cop I know to a total stranger.

I’d usually say it’s weird that it’s 3am, but everyone involved here keeps night hours and because they are friends outside work, the cop knew there was a chance OP would be available to chat about the ex situation at 3am. To me, that they all are known to work/be up during night shift time mitigates any of the usual strangeness of being texted at 3am."
410,"This would be a huge deal because in the course of a life, you'll have other situations like this and you know you can't rely on him. If you lam on having kids, then know you'll be the primary caregiver and won't get much help. 

I'm guessing he moved for you cause he wanted to. The issue will be when he doesn't want to."
411,"I made a comment, on this post, and your other post, and the gist was something along the lines of keeping this to yourself, because you might burn Bridges with your family. My suggestion was to seek a therapist, and talk about ways to bring it up to your family after talking it over with a therapist.


But then I read through your post history. Oh my gosh. You were repeatedly raped at age 16 by your married 40 something year old teacher. That is not sex work, that is rape. Of course you're feeling terrible and traumatized. Of course you want to tell your family.


This isn't about you feeling guilty about sex work, this is about you processing the trauma of being repeatedly raped at such a young age. I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm so sorry you were taken advantage of by a predator.

I do still recommend therapy. A therapist can help you process all of this, and can give you a detailed plan on how to talk to your family about all of this. You're not alone. A therapist has heard all of this and more, you can't shock them, they are there to help.


Do you think you can talk to your mom about setting up some weekly appointments with a psychologist? You don't have to tell her why. Just tell her that right now, you have some things you'd like to talk about with a professional. 


I'm so sorry for what happened to you.


Again, what happened to you was not sex work. Even if you were given money, or gifts, or anything like that. You were taken advantage of and raped by your married teacher, which is a crime. He is no doubt doing it to some other girl right now.

Maybe you had sex with other people after your teacher and accepted money from them. My guess is that you never would have done that if you hadn't had this experience with the teacher who raped you. This is something to talk about with a trained professional."
412,OP come on now. You know this is not ok. He's made it clear he's not willing to change. The ball is now in your court to decide if you're willing to accept it or not.
413,This is such a great thought and I feel so dumb that I hadn’t already thought of it myself. Seriously this is the compromise that I’ve been looking for.
414,"&gt; getting a CPAP changed my life.

Me, too. Within a week, I went from being tired all day, every day, to actually having energy. I'm in bed for the same amount of time, but I actually *sleep*.

I only wish I hadn't waited so long to talk to the doctor about it."
415,Can you book a vacation for yourself somewhere for a week? Maybe even 2? So you literally can’t enable him?
416,If it bothers you to the point of not being able to look at her why are you still together? It’s been 4 months.
417,Lmao. Use your brain. Your bf is a scumbag and doesnt want anything about this relationship to be fair. Move on. Stop being so daft. Hes a legit scumbag for cheating and for being hurt over you taking to other guys lmao. Who the fuk does he think he is. Have some self respect and dump his trash ass
418,"Don't bring her around your cousins, for a start. Did they apologize?"
419,"Is there any chance that she is doing this as a scapegoat... Is there a possibility that she knows this story is fabricated and is using it as an ""easy"" way out? Have you guys had any other issues in the past?"
420,That phone call you're going to get in a few months is gonna be interesting
421,"Girl? You are so deep into this toxicity you can’t even see it. 

You literally are not allowed to BREATHE without permission.

This is so toxically controlling and unhealthy. You need to get in to therapy and get out of this relationship.

Normal people don’t ask for what he is asking for."
422,"I was going to say to mention to your gf, “fine, so be it. We won’t share a bank account and won’t deposit money into HER account anymore”. Then, I saw how she storms off angry and she says that she hates you and hates every second spent with you. I’d be reconsidering this relationship. 

Is there anything more you’ve done to trigger this for her? This is unhealthy and abusive."
423,"He cheated on you and you're allowing him to be a whiny baby about sex *you* had? This really sounds dump-worthy. 
Yeah, the context is there for him to be a little offended, but he should easily be able to get over it after your explanation and a little time. Instead, he's obsessing on Jared's magical unicorn dick of unparalleled pleasure, and taking out his frustrations about it on you."
424,"&gt; Life's too short for weak coffee and bad sex. 

This should be on a shirt!"
425,I've talked to her about it. She understands and apologized but still feels obligated for some reason...
426,Uhhhhh this sounds really scary op. This is how ppl end up raped/murdered. Get some serious security locks/alarms and be super cautious with this guy.  I'd call the police and ask them what you should do or tell him if he doesn't stop creeping you will get a restraining order. Take this seriously.
427,"This is exactly why you should dump this guy and get a therapist, because you are treating him like a therapist and you're trying pay this perceived debt off with emotions instead of money.  He's a nice guy.  He has helped you, but that doesn't mean that you have to stay with him and forgo the opportunity to have a partner who prioritizes you."
428,"OMG  this isn't 'one unspoken rule' this is him wanting to control every last thought and action you have. 


Were you abused as a kid? I bet you aren't allowed to work or spend even a dollar without permission. 

Girl can you even buy a candy bar without his approval? 

What does he do if you don't comply? Is he having a meltdown because you turned the radio on without informing him? Does he check your search history to berate you on what you forgot to tell him about? Does he even have a job besides being up your ass and monitoring your every action? 

You are deep in a seriously abusive relationship. 

Please come to r/abusiverelationships and we will help you make a plan to get out. This is SO FAR from healthy. My neighbors 2 yr old has more freedom than you."
429,You said you don’t want to be on the bosses bad side and then asked your bf to pretty much be the one to stand up to her and not communicate with her. I think he was in a tough situation trying not to make an issue so it wouldn’t later affect you. I don’t think he was being malicious. I think you should go to HR and report her if she is being rude to you. It’s not your bfs job to be the middle man IMO
430,"SO true. How can my 7/8year old son manage to load and unload the dishwasher, load the dryer and bring his dirty washing down yet my 27year old manchild cant? 🤦‍♀️ his face is AMAZING when he realises he has no clean work tshirts because he didnt bring them down.."
431,"I can understand why you are upset. You are good enough to brainstorm and help design a wedding but not be invited to it? I would just say "" hey, I'm curious why I didn't get an invite. It's not like I didn't know when it was because I helped you plan but I feel hurt at not being told why I'm excluded""."
432,"Tell your mom if she wants to go to the police based on the messages she has received, you have no objection. If she wants to show them to you, you'd very much like to see them, otherwise you understand. Then go on about your life as if she didn't tell you anything. If she actually has a real basis for her suspicions, she'll tell you about it soon enough. 

I'm about 90% sure that this is an invention of your mother's neurotic mind, and she exaggerated/embellished this story either to keep you from going to this organizer again, or just because she's addicted to the drama and (especially) the attention it can bring to her."
433,"My boyfriend and I just got two Twin XL memory foam mattresses which fit perfectly on a King-sized platform, and then we each have our own blankets.  We also use two white noise machines and I use ear plugs.  It’s extreme butit works!!!"
434,"I had an ex husband who would cry when I told him his laziness was affecting our marriage.  He let all the emotional and physical labor be my job, but I wasnt going to let him get away with that. The first couple times I told him it was okay...until I realized that he was crying to *manipulate* me. After that I had zero sympathy and essentially divorced him because I didnt want to be his mommy. 

Remorse is a two parter, it requires changing too."
435,"For real, self-involved is right.  Sitting on the couch while you cook dinner?  Why can't he wash veggies, set table, wash dishes you've used them so clean up isn't as bad when dinner isn't done?  

Have a conversation about what happened during the day while your in the kitchen?

I know my daughter works hard, takes care of the kids and her ex would be on his Xbox and never ever washed a dish."
436,"So what you are actually saying is that he isn't perfect. He lives in filth, takes no care of himself, and no care of his surroundings. The vectors of infection that you are opening yourself up to by being intimate with this guy make me shudder.

&gt; He swears ~~he’ll be~~ I'll clean when we live together 

FTFY.

Seriously, this guy is 21. You are not his mom, you are not his maid. Either you accept that this is the way he is happy to live and deal with your disgust or move on. Do not waste your time trying to 'improve' him."
437,Your boyfriend has some sexist ideas. You’re still a woman even if you dress casual. And you said you get dressed up on dates and usually do wear feminine clothing so what’s his deal? Why do you need to dress a certain way every single time you’re with him?
438,"Never, ever, just accept a bad delivery.  You should always take pictures and notify the florist that the delivery was not acceptable.   If they don't replace with better flowers, tell your boyfriend he should request a refund from the florist first.  If they still don't do anything, he can file a claim with the credit card copanyl."
439,She’s insecure and feels like you’re going to leave her for someone better if she opens up to you
440,"&gt; Divorcing him won't suddenly change who he is there.

It will still free her to find a partner that actually treats her well. I don’t see the point of advices like this that boil down to just “act like you are divorced, but still stay together because reasons”."
441,"&gt;Right now he's promised to go to counselling, and hasn't. Has he failed? Yes. Who is paying the price? Certainly not him.

If she let him know that his lack of effort for her were to lead to her divorcing him, and then followed through with that if he didn't do the work, that would be him paying the price."
442,Thank you. ❤️It’s hard to see it’s the right decision but I’m trusting my head over my heart right now.
443,"
&gt;Wife has been on disability since before we met due to a legitimate health condition and her mother handles her benefit check. I always worked and although I don't make a lot of money I always made sure we both ended up with an equal amount of spending money.

Why is mom handling her money?  That is a major place to start with this.   Her parents should be completely out of her financial life.   

As to the other stuff,  I mean,  it's an unreasonable expectation for her to just ""go along with"" whatever her and her mother decide, but it doesn't sound like you've asserted your position in the relationship as a partner.   Start now."
444,"I dunno if you'll take this advice, but know that this is coming from someone who's been married for 18 years. Love is not the most important thing in a relationship. Love is not enough to make one work, either. Trust, respect and compatibility are far more important. You guys are lacking 2 of these."
445,Someone gild this please I'm poor. What an amazing expression.
446,"Honestly if she can’t understand why this would be upsetting to you then this is a longer conversation between you two.  You contacted a lot of people, in the future I’d recommend going directly to 911 for a safety check if you’re truly concerned to avoid bringing family into a potentially very sensitive situation.  Otherwise you did the right thing.

I’m more concerned about how you’re doing.  Who’s taking care of you at all either now or later on?  You were clearly scared enough to call the cops and now you’re scared to go home.  Maybe reach out to someone that you can vent to or get the support you need."
447,"&gt;I NEEDED her

No, you do not need this woman in your life at all.   Your insistence on including her is what you need to work on.   If you don't want her to call or visit you, don't let her.   Keep your telephone discussions short and superficial -- when she goes off into your business, tell her you have an obligation and hang up.   When she says she wants to visit, tell her you'll let her know when you can make time and leave it.  Do not get into any discussions about it

&gt;f it were up to me, I would have bought my own car

It WAS up to you, and still is.  Save your money and be ready to buy a nice used car if she comes to take it away.  She won't though, because that would a relinquishment of control.   You don't have to let it control you, let her ruin her credit and have it repossessed.  There is no reason to be hostage to a car."
448,"Okay, but... presumably you were able to find employment in Berlin before.

Leave. Ignore your parents. Your mother's emotional blackmail is just that. It's not your fault or responsibility she married an inadequate husband. Clearly she has friends. Let them step up.

Quit your job, get the hell out of the country, and don't look back."
449,"Yeah. My sister told me that John is going to be self conscious enough about it when he's old enough to understand he doesn't have a hand. She said she doesn't want my mother telling him he's weird or ugly because of it.

My dad has just been on my case because what mom does effects him."
450,"Find a couple's counselor who has experience with transgender and gender-fluid individuals, or at least is positive about the idea, so you can have a safe space and a moderator to have these conversations with your husband."
451,"Oh shit no no no no no no. RUN. Honestly right off the bat like this, this is scary. This is not someone you want to be with. I’m not joking this is frightening."
452,"this. just be open, there is no need to hype it up in your head. and i'm sure as a friend she might even feel relieved that this is the reason and there isn't something else going on"
453,"Let me get this straight. Your partner is upset that your one hour out of the house turned into two hours out of the house? And this occurred after the child had been put to bed, therefor no longer requiring your help? I don’t even know what to say, except this dynamic is poisonous and you will absolutely grow to resent her if it continues. 

If you’re staying out late all the time then there’s an issue. If this is a rare occurrence (which I’m guessing it is because she doesn’t seem like the type to “let” you have fun) then she needs to chill the fuck out. The fact she needs to “let” you do things makes me laugh out loud. Your wife is the reason so many people think of all women as crazy and controlling."
454,"1. If they move to hug you, hug them back!
2. Don’t be intimidated by them being accomplished. They should be accomplished. They are 50. They were all also 29 once and floundering in life. 
3. Ask them about their interests. What do they do, how old are their kids, do their kids play sports or other activities, what do they think of the latest season of thrones. 
4. Just be kind and friendly and go with the flow."
455,"Number one piece of advice I can give you is: do NOT be alone with him when you break the news. The most dangerous point for a woman in an abusive relationship is when they try to leave; their abuser will often escalate their behaviour, either manipulation or violence, as a means to get them to stay. 

Get a plan together so that you are ready to leave as soon as you have broken the news. Have your parents, your sister or a friend with you when you tell him."
456,"You really gotta listen to your therapist. No point in going if you don't do what they say. He doesn't order pizza? Don't fucking do it for him. When they kids complain they are hungry ""ask your dad, he was supposed to order pizza"" Let him do damage control. If he doesn't suffer the shame and embarrassment of facing starving kids how the fuck is he supposed to realize he needs to change?"
457,That is APPALLING behavior from a mother.
458,"The thing is, this is how he is. Assuming you have quite clearly explained to him how he is letting you down, then you need to be prepared to be let down from time to time (those times of course at his election) as a cost of this relationship. In the future, there’ll be plenty more times when you will be vulnerable and in need of comfort &amp; support from him. He may very well be there *most* of the time (when he doesn’t have to wash his hair) - but will that be enough?

Two more things:

1. Selfish people don’t care about reciprocity unless there’s a deficit in their favour.

2. These “strangers” are to a  significant extent your family members. They may be literally *strangers* but they’re future connections of his.  The way he’s put his reasons for not going is interesting to say the least."
459,"“Boyfriend, I don’t judge or criticize how you spend your free time, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t weight in on the perceived value of my recreational activities either. It’s bumming me out and this is not how I want to interact with you.  I’m not going to justify how I spend my time as long as it’s not harming anyone”. 

Just be blunt. This stops now."
460,"&gt;  I’m not gonna micromanage his family relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

Behold, your advice to yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also:

&gt; my bf usually doesn’t even like getting together with his family without me as a buffer.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is not healthy, and something you should be glad to be getting out of. You managing his family interactions, both through reminding him to plan things and acting as a buffer at them, should not be happening so congrats. 

If him and his brother can't remember to plan family things or deal with tension, let them fail."
461,The crazy thing is I’m not a stay-at-home mom. I work full-time at a nonprofit and do 3-5 consulting projects a year to help pay our bills and have extra income. Thank you for this wake up call.
462,"Agreed. Her quitting her job is not the right move right now.

&gt; I don't know how I feel about raising another woman's child. 

OP, you don't have to be the child's primary caregiver. You can start as a step-parent and see how you feel about that first. That puts you in a support role and not in a mother role."
463,"I don’t really see the point in engaging any further with her except if she needs a reminder on her move out date.  Nothing you can say will make her react any less dramatically than she already does.  Just stick to your guns on her moving out.  Also stop hiding in your room in your own apartment.  You and your other roommate, plus all your friends should boisterously enjoy the common areas.  You will be so relieved when she is gone."
464,"A hard truth I had to face as an adult: you don’t. Once you lose a long term friend...you probably won’t ever get that level of history with a new friend. You can build new and different friendships! Some even just as sweet and meaningful. 

I had to process and come to terms with that, before I could start to move on."
465,"I don't think you can rebuild when someone doesn't respect you, the rules you both have agreed upon or the relationship"
466,"Wow, I'm Christian and was raised in a fairly religious home, and that sounds absolutely crazytown. She's literally an adult and even as a teenager I never had a chaperone. If she's not willing to circumvent her family than you either have to accept it or move on (I'd personally not to be able to deal with that)."
467,"Right?!? If she can't even take care of herself, why is taking on responsibility for eleven animals???"
468,"We’ll cry together girl, Netflix and chocolate ❤️"
469,"It's easier to lean on the one who's ""far away"" and ""should be home"" and who you know can be guilted instead of having to accept that you married a selfish shitbag and raised a selfish little piss-stain."
470,But then the foot monster could get you...
471,At this point it doesn’t even matter if you come off as insecure. These are all red red flags she’s obviously hiding these from you because she knows it’s something that’ll upset you.
472,"If he is a lawyer and been through shit, I can see where he'd fixate on it. He may have had this self preservation idea that he will only ever get married if he can ultimately give himself a quick escape. I get why you feel insulted OP but he really isn't targeting you. He wants to give himself piece of mind and not feel like he compromised his own convictions. It protects you legally as well as letting him get over a major anxiety. Couples counseling sounds like a good idea. But this doesn't necessarily mean his faith in you specifically is shaken."
473,"Was about to write this. Anyone who doesn't prioritise your concerns especially after you've told him that you don't like secrets, is violating you and is probably hiding not just something but a lot from you. 



It doesn't look like he cares for you because a person who cares would pay attention to your concerns and help you resolve them. He's not doing that. Hence, the only conclusion is that you're not as important as the others in his life. It sucks OP, and I'm sorry this isn't what you want to hear right now but it's what it is. You're clearly sidelined and not respected enough and you need to leave."
474,"When I got divorced this is basically what happened. He was abusive and neglectful and I was the one handling finances and daily household stuff. When he was gone, I went through depression and loneliness, but my day to day life was actually made easier because I was no longer taking care of everything for him."
475,"My horribly abusive first husband was a feeder (among several other awful things), I had never encountered the term and wouldn't have guessed such a thing existed. He deliberately picked me, a vulnerable and naive young woman a little younger than OP, and made me dependent on him in every way including believing no one would ever love me but him. The way he was around food was how OP describes her BF almost to a scary similarity down to the things he'd say about the gross fast food he'd over-order for me. 

I was plump when we met, size 10-12, and he got me to stop exercising entirely and subtly shamed my body till I basically just wore tents. Over a period of 5 years as his manipulation and abuse escalated, I ballooned to size 30. He would feed me a pizza a day and control almost every aspect of our daily life. Toward the end of our relationship as I started to face how bad things really were and come out of the FOG, I learned he had a fat fetish, that he was posting about me on feeder sites, and that what had happened to my self esteem &amp; weight were deliberately caused by him. 

It's taken me over 15 years to recover my physical and mental health and start to lose weight. I'm down to a size 18-20 now, and still have about 100lbs to lose. I'm in my mid 40's. He stole my youth and health, all for his fetish. 

OP needs to take this VERY seriously or she could waste years of her life to this guy."
476,"u/knoxchivette I’ve been in your exact situation where my ex girlfriend did, scarily, the exact same thing your boyfriend is doing and I was the “other guy (woman in your case)” in the situation. If he’s anything like my ex he’ll end up gaslighting you, blaming you for their own actions, and make you feel like you’re the villain for wanting a transparent and honest relationship. In my situation she also went on a smear campaign to anyone who would listen and tell them lies about me to get them on her side because, in her words, “I don’t want people liking you more than me.”

Save yourself the years of therapy I went through to find out I wasn’t the asshole in the situation that she made me out to be and move on from this guy. There’s someone out there who you will fall more in love with that will actually respect your boundaries and will incorporate you fully into their life and wouldn’t have it any other way.

To my ex who I know is stalking my reddit account,

I really hope you never put anyone else through what you put me and the other guys before me through because of how empty of a person you are inside. I stand by my words when I finally got smart and ended it with my therapist’s encouragement that you were misery incarnate."
477,"Nagging is a word that means ""You have to repeatedly ask me to do something that I should do without being asked to do it *at all* and somehow you're also the bad person in this scenario"". The fact that this word exists at all is fucking wild."
478,Your wife needs therapy. Playing a board game should not be a crushing experience. They likely gave her a harder time because she wasn't playing.
479,"Yeah, when I got to that line I almost laughed. Obviously the BF isn't the only one entitled here. She needs to educate herself on leases and roommates."
480,"I'd ask the Title IX office for ""advice"" on how to handle your situation.  

Why is ""advice"" in quotes?  Because you already know that you need to ignore this guy.  But, by asking for ""advice,"" if this situation escalates, it will already be on record.  After you're done asking for ""advice"" email yourself a quick synopsis of your conversation with the Title IX person, including their name, date, overall advice given."
481,Booms s simple as that. One thing I tell myself is that I will make sure I’m not marrying someone that I have to treat like a child...not a partner.
482,"A lot of people deal with this. A *lot.*

A lot also turn into untrustworthy people. Don't let that be you. If you need to sow your oats for a while so be it, just make sure a breakup comes first. 

If your girlfriend is important enough to you to keep, realize that monogamy isn't easy. If it was, there wouldn't be so many people failing at it. That's not an excuse to cheat, but do give yourself a break for these feelings."
483,"&gt; I didn’t even bring it up until yesterday

This is your issue OP. You don't let him fail and then don't even make him suffer the consequences of upsetting you. I am sure you know that if 6 years ago you would have made it apparent that the way he takes you for granted hurts you then you'd be in a very different place right now. 

Your therapist is saying let him fail because that will show him his inaction has consequences but those are physical consequences, like the car burning out or his credit dropping. I'd recommend taking a look at yourself and see if you've ever made him feel the consequences of letting YOU down and if he cares enough about how you feel to make the necessary changes. 

He doesn't do things at work because he is trying to make his boss happy, he does them because he gets personal satisfaction and doesn't get fired. It should be the same at home, he should get satisfaction for making you happy and he should not want to get fired (divorced). So lay out the cards, give him his 6 year evaluation, stop passing him along at your own expense and give him real consequences. In 6 months he may be posting here ""My wife left me because I didn't get the oil changed and now my car and life blew up in my face"""
484,"You aren't being ""insecure""

The reasons you've mentioned are legit red flags."
485,Thanks! And good way to sum that up and get to the root cause: The depression is the cause and is what needs to be fixed before anything else can really be addressed.
486,All of that plus OP’s hub is military. He can not afford the potential trouble BIL brings with him. One relapse that goes south could affect his career forever simply due to proximity.
487,"Just make yourself scarce when they are around. It’s a shitty situation, but you don’t really have a choice but to get around it."
488,"My Husband snores aggressively, it sounds like two jackhammers tag-teaming a woodchipper.  At first quality foam ear plugs were okay, but eventually I too started sleeping in the other room.  Like someone else mentioned here; we would fall asleep together and then once the snoring started, I'd move.  Since I wake up earlier than him naturally, on weekends or when time allowed, I'd get back in bed with him so we could wake up together.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, I missed sleeping in my own bed and would panic on vacations or when we had guests making the extra space unusable.  So I started sleeping with earbuds in using a white noise app on my phone.  The one I have allows you to combine a bunch of sounds together to get something you like.  For me, playing a thunderstorm and a fire together make it so his snoring is just kind of another noise in the soothing symphony I am listening to.  It's not startling since there is already thunder so I don't really wake up.  It has really helped, and since I started doing it last year I have not slept in the other room once.  

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus: the white noise kind of created a pavlovian response, so pretty much as soon as I start the app I am sleeping."
489,"You can ""prove"" that your live-in girlfriend of four years went to a party with you and was so taken with someone she met there that she abandoned you and went off to spend hours with this other dude.   Whether or not she slept with him is irrelevant: she acting like a single woman who had sparked with someone and was down for fanning that spark into whatever fire she could.

You can hesitate to call it cheating if you like but it's not the behavior of someone committed to her current relationship."
490,Oh god. I'm thinking you're the other woman.
491,He can either be with you or with his fantasies  about Jared's dick. He cant be with both.
492,"Unfortunately, I think you have to respect his wishes right now. Check in with him about telling mutual friends that he's in the hospital and could use support but doesn't want visitors. Maybe people can up their texting and meme-sending. 

Also, don't go broke. Being there for someone who's long-term sick is a marathon, as you know. Make sure you're taking care of yourself too, especially in basic ways like making sure you can pay your bills. Lots of love to you all."
493,"Ok so let me recap your choice here: Family or girlfriend?

||Family|Girlfriend|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Consistency|Consistently supportive, even when they don't agree with your choices (i.e. gf)|Has already broken up with you.  Consistently rude.|
|Support|Offers to help you with housing and plan tickets, and have looked out for you|Will give you silent treatment if you dare do something she doesn't like|
|Conflict|Respects your decision, is open to reconciling with your gf|Does not respect your decisions, and pressures you.  Also has made no effort to reconcile with her parents although she is in the wrong|
|Love|Loves you even when you don't do what they want|Only treats you well when you do what she wants|

I'm just going by the information in your post.  The choice is yours."
494,"I feel like he has a fetish for fatness and/or making you fat to have more control of you/ lower your confidence so he can feel like you are his completely
Leave him. This is unhealthy for your mind, soul and body"
495,"I think because you guys are going on vacation together, it's not about the trips but the communication. I thinks it's reasonable and healthy to have trips alone or with other friends (you should do the same). However, given where your relationship is, he should run it by you to let you know and make sure there aren't any conflicts (i.e. cousin's wedding, friends birthday party).

I'm guessing he isn't doing that because he prefers to not have you on these trips and is worried you'll invite yourself? I think you should continue to plan stuff together but try to get to the root of the communication breakdown."
496,"&gt; The crazy thing is I’m not a stay-at-home mom. I work full-time at a nonprofit and do 3-5 consulting projects a year to help pay our bills and have extra income. Thank you for this wake up call.

Wow - that just makes it even more inexcusable. Even if you were a stay-at-home mom, your husband should *still* be contributing *something*. The fact that you work full-time just like he does makes his refusal to lift a finger even more infuriating.

Thanks for circling back in; I wish you and your daughter all the best going forward. You're a great mom and wife - please don't let your husband's lack of appreciation impact your self-confidence.

Don't hesitate to let me or the rest of our community here know if we can provide any additional advice/support in future."
497,"I'm going to disagree with you on him being a good dad, because he's not. You've told us here that he uses the kids as a weapon against you to make you feel guilty so he can control you. That is by definition not a good father. Kids are very smart and sensitive when it comes to the most important relationship in the world for them, your marriage. They absolutely are watching when he does that and its showing them (1) how to be a partner to someone and (2) what to expect from their partners. Is that what you want them to learn?"
498,"Are you sure he never act this way? Few weeks ago he was rude to the point you dropped idea of weekend visit. Every time you call he is in the moment. You two spend very little time together. 

I think that some of what he said was designed to humiliate you and make you angry - like the cooking thing and sex thing. But also some of that is his view on expected role of women in relationship. Quite likely, friends have same views.

You just found why he has numeous ex-girlfriends and none stuck."
499,"While wanting to know why he suddenly flipped his shit/started making things up is valid, you will probably never get the answer.

I have a feeling your gut instinct is right. Also it feels like he's trying to break you or something it's disgusting. 

Get away from him and when he inevitably calls you in a few days/weeks/months just ignore him don't pick up and don't reply. Move on and find someone who isn't a sack of disrespectful crap."
500,"You guys sound fundamentally incompatible. She isn't ready to turn her back on her family and her beliefs, and you just don't factor into that world at all. 

You've been together two years and she still refuses to tell her family about you. She's living a lie. When will that end? At this point it looks like never.

Don't be somebody's dirty little secret. You deserve better than that. You deserve somebody who is proud to call you their partner."
501,"My husband and I both have family members who are drug addicts (and sadly, lost one earlier this year to overdose).   More than 90% of the time, taking addict into your home will end badly.  

An addict will lie, cheat, and steal to get their fix.  They will literally steal (and pawn or trade for drugs) ANYTHING they can get their hands on... jewelry, game systems, cash from your wallet, etc.  And if they want a fix badly enough they'll break into a locked cabinet or beat a family membrr to get money or something of value for their fix.  Even the nicest person will do whatever they need to do to get drugs.

Drug addicts are absolutely the world's best liars and manipulators.  They are almost always ""recovering"", if that's what they think you want to hear.  They will tell you a story so convincingly that you'll question your own sanity.

The problem is that the possible downsides (your BIL beating you to get money for a fix or getting in a physical fight with your husband that results in both going to jail, which jams up your husband's military career or just the drama and upheaval causing stress in your marriage) aren't worth the risk.

Instead, consider looking into sober living homes.  Because your BIL needs someplace that will understand and help him in the ways he truly needs help.  It's possible that he could move into one near you... or maybe you could find one a couple hours from his current home.

You and your husband could budget some money to contribute to BIL's expenses in some way.  It should go without saying, but never give an addict money or anything (such as gift cards, cell phone) that could easily be traded or sold for drugs or alcohol.  Pay their rent or utility bill directly, never give them cash.

What addicts need most is to hear that you love them and hope they can get, and stay, clean.  If your husband can try to stay in touch with his brother and tell him how much he's loved, that's a lot."
502,Women get pegged with the “nagging” thing all the time to the point where I get self-conscious that I may be coming off that way when talking to my own partner. I hate it
503,"Please don't do it.

You said it yourself - this is a last ditch effort. Meaning that there have been multiple efforts until now, all of which have failed.

This is probably also going to fail.

What will that failure look like? 

- Drugs in your home - how will that affect your husband's career if those drugs are found by the authorities to be in his home?
- Theft of your property - you can't bolt down everything.
- Assault - your husband won't be with you as a buffer 24/7. What's your plan if he gets violent when you're alone with him?

If you want to help him, then help him to get into his own place nearby. Either by himself, or in an assisted living complex (see if there's anything in your area to help addicts with reintegration).



Your husband will be able to visit/stay over as often as he likes.

But if he spirals, you won't be taken down with him."
504,"&gt;I have expressed to him multiple times that I cannot have secrets in a relationship

So here's the thing... you are in a relationship with multiple secrets. You have expressed your concern about this many times. Your boyfriend disagrees, doesn't care, and isn't going to change. You can't change him, so you really have two options. 

1. Accept that you are in a relationship with many secrets.
2. Leave him.

That's it. Those are the options. There really aren't any special words you can say that will suddenly make your BF change his mind. You get to choose between 1 and 2."
505,"This sounds like too much nonsense to be dealing with in a LDR. You obviously dont trust her and I dont blame you.  How well do you even know her?  If it were me, I'd move on and enjoy the trip myself if there was suspicion of cheating"
506,"I think the fact that you are asking how much pressure to put on him about this nothing issue is a clue as to why he might lie about such an innocuous thing. He is a grown man, he can watch whatever he wants. Leave him alone."
507,"&gt;Probably a bit of selfishness in here too since he's capable when its important to him 

A lot of selfishness. By being on time for things that are important to him, he's telling you that you are not important to him.  You are not overreacting in the least. Personally, that would be a deal breaker for me, because I wouldn't want to keep wasting time with someone who constantly shows me that he doesn't give a shit about me."
508,"Holy shit I wish I'd read this a year ago. This is exactly what happened with my ex down to asking for an open relationship. Eventually he did do something shitty enough to make me leave (vacation to another country with a stripper), and tried to play the victim to our friends. 

OP don't let it get to this stage. You deserve someone who loves you as you are, and wants to be with you. It'll hurt like hell but you'll feel free and so much happier. And then you'll find someone who finds all of you attractive, and you will realise that you're not broken. You never were. And you deserved better."
509,"You're right. When I would see him around campus, even saying ""hi"" in passing would inevitably lead to him texting me. The unblocking previously opened the door to him consistently messaging me despite little to no reciprocation. It's taken me a few months, but I think I'm starting to realize that I just have to be a little ""mean"" because clearly telling him what I want hasn't worked."

It's an incredibly BIG problem. It's like saying, ""The only problem with this soup is the there's a small lump of shit in it."""
512,"Your roommates are 100% right here.

Let me guess, your stomach is in knots over this. I'm going to guess that your boyfriend creates a lot of situations where your stomach is in knots.

Your boyfriend has been wrong about every part of this. He's trying to make you feel guilty because he dropped the ball. And the thing is, you're feeling guilty. You don't have to.


Your roommates hate your boyfriend because of his own actions. This is a situation your boyfriend created. It's not up to you to fix, it's not up to you to force your roommates to get along with your boyfriend. All your boyfriend had to do was be polite, and he blew it. He's not a nice guy. So stop mediating for your boyfriend. If your boyfriend gets upset about your roommates, tell your boyfriend that that is between him and them, and not to involve you.

Your boyfriend needs to figure out his housing situation like an adult. This is not your problem, it's not for you to fix, and even if your boyfriend ends up on the streets, that has nothing to do with you. Stop feeling guilty about a problem he is creating. If he wasn't so picky, he would have a home. Stop panicking about his choices. If he's thrown out on the streets without a roof over his head, and he's crying about how it's all your fault, you can literally roll your eyes and tell him whatever. You have literally no blame here. Stop falling for his manipulations, you're too old for it. 

He's making you feel like you're horrible and unsupportive because that way, you'll do what he wants. He is manipulating you. He's making you feel guilty and it's working. Let me guess, he has you convinced that if he can't live with you, then he'll be out on the streets, homeless, and you're the most horrible monster who ever lived because what kind of person would let their own boyfriend be homeless? Like it's your problem, and your fault, and if you don't fix it, you're the worst girlfriend ever. He expects you to fix his problem. Don't do it!


Treat him like an adult. Get used to saying things like ""I'm sure you'll figure out a solution."" ""I can't help you with that, but I know you'll work it out.""


That's if you even want to stay with such a guy, I know how these people can brainwash you though, so I'm trying to give you options instead of breaking up right away. You'll break up when you're ready, this is unsustainable."

515,"Honey I have been in relationships like this. You think everything is fine and then out of nowhere, they seem to collapse your whole world around you. And let me tell you this, the only thing you can do it's walk away. It is so hard. But the sooner you do it, the sooner you will get over it. And you will move on and you will be okay. It took me a very long time, but I was just thinking about how, if I had known that someone could live me the way my current boyfriend does, I would've saved myself a lot of hurt and tears. You will find someone to love and respect you who won't make you questions yourself or your relationship. You will never feel secure or safe in your current relationship ever again. The sooner you leave, the sooner you can start anew phase of your life: a phase where you are happy and loved and cherished. You deserve that."
516,"Honestly it sounds like the whole drug use either started back up or never went away. He has shitty attitudes towards boundaries and communication. Nudes don't equal earning respect. That's so manipulative. The driving drunk is a recipe for him to end up in jail and unemployed or hurt himself or other people. The fact he blew you off as his hall monitor is such a red flag.

Honestly, mail his stuff to his new address while he's out of state and block him."
517,"&gt; I don't gay if he's gay,

Just pointing out a brilliant typo.

Has he told your wife anything about why he feels like you dont care? Have you noticed yourself drifting out of his life? Like, have you stopped asking him about his day at school/work/whatever? Do you offer to do things with him (sounds like he likes sports, offer to watch games with him on tv, or take him to a game if you can afford it)? 

Maybe a little 'out there' but are you vocal about sensitive topics/do you like to debate? Watch channels that arnt LGBTQ+ positive?"
518,Why can't you move back or to a bigger city? You signed a contract? Get out of your comfort zone and make friends with people outside of your race. There are no foreign people in your city? Volunteer. Save money and plan to move away in 2 years.

523,"This is between your mother, your sister and your brother-in-law. Do not get involved in trying to repair something that you had no part in damaging, otherwise you'll be seen as agreeing with your mother's awful comments.

&gt;My mom claims she was just speaking her mind that the baby didn't look as cute as it would have with 2 hands, and that she didn't mean anything negative by it.

People like your mother really piss me off, because there is a time and a place for speaking one's mind, but they have no filter and offload the responsibility of their words onto the offended party, because people should just grow a thicker skin, right? Nope. She needs to understand that what she said was completely unacceptable and as an adult, has a responsibility to fix this herself. 

My advice is to support your sister, continue to see her and the baby, and play no part in trying to help your mother make amends."
524,"Oh damn well Ive been there before. **He's hiding you**.

Trust me, Ive been there. They gaslight you by saying fb isnt a big deal. Unless he doesnt use facebook at all and is one of those people kinda against the culture. not wanting a public relationship status after a year and a half is very telling. Not posting or taking photos is a big indiciation. Not allowing tags is a big indication.

The simplest answer is almost always the right one. Pretend youre an outsider. Would you know who his girlfriend was, or if he even had one, from his profile? Theres your answer.

My ex was obsessed with facebook and we were very interactive on it. But later on, it was the total opposite. Turns out she was slurping up dudes at work and on tinder everyday and threw out the idea of an open relationship when confronted. Nope, nope, nope.

525,"So you spent a vacation banging a girl 14 years younger than you while she had a boyfriend you knew you were a party to her cheating on him. Now she's ghosting you. Lol yes, it's time to move on. There was no future there anyway."

528,"I was going to yell at someone but I'm going to be supportive instead and go to you! It's difficult to see because...well, on one hand, he totally makes more than you. But on the other hand, you're totally subsidizing *his* lifestyle right now.

And I know some people are going but how, he makes more- but you're currently living in an area that you can't exactly afford on your own, yeah? And you say you wouldn't live there if it wasn't for him wanting to live there. And you're paying for half the rent (perfectly fair if you're roommates; I shudder to imagine it as a romantic partnership) and he's paying for the other half. I live near an expensive metro area too and I'm pretty sure compromises like you guys moving slightly further out and him taking the bus/train/etc in exist. But you aren't. So he gets the short commute and that extra $300 fun budget is money he'd be spending on rent if he lived by himself but you're subsidizing for him.

So yeah, I think it's hard to see because on one hand you're going but he makes so much more money, but on the other hand the question is if he can do everything he's currently doing if you don't live with him and I think the answer to that is a no. His retirement funds are *your* money. His video games are from *your* future.

If it makes you feel better, though, OP, I wasn't dating her or anything but I once had a ""friend"" who wanted me to be her roommate and I told her I'd be paying more money for rent and my commute would be significantly longer, why, and she said it would be great because I could nag at her to eat, nag at her to sleep, subsidize her life so she could get an apartment close to her work, drive her around, and she could cook for me. I said no, but you're not the only one who had roommate/living space troubles."
529,"How is what you're saying not more romantic than giving things? This has so much thought and love put into it, I'm sure he'll love it!"
530,"&gt; He uses my guilt as a tool to hurt me when he wants to win an argument. 

Leave your abusive husband.

Your son will be fine. Babies are resilient. These things happen to pretty much every parent. I know it happened to my mother - twice, because the second time, the baby found a new way to squirm free. She told me about it so I'd know, and I have had babies nearly get away from me despite that forewarning and only not fall because I don't ever not keep at least one hand on the squirrelly little critters if they're on a changing table or whatever.

Guilt is also normal, but seriously, he'll be fine.

Your husband, meanwhile, is terrible. That's emotional abuse and you should not put up with it. Get away while he's gone and you can."
531,"OP, I agree with this advice. Tell your mother that you don’t want the stuff &amp; that she should not try to drop it off for you. You don’t want her to show up to your work with boxes of stuff &amp; no idea that you’ve told reception not to let her in. That just makes the situation more difficult for everyone involved."
532,"&gt; He claims it’s because of how his ex-girlfriends have acted about him having female friends that makes him hide it 

""And **I** have a problem with you hiding it, **not** the female friends"". It's not ""absurd and controlling"" to want the very basics about your boyfriend's life - it's bee 18 months! It's **bizarre** that he's not including you in his life, which makes me think he's deliberately keeping you separate from it. At this point it's not that you're not privy to a few specifics about his life, it's that he's got his entire life, and you're this little tiny isolated part of it. Friends **matter** \- when my wife and I met each other it was important for both of us that we met each other's friends, because they're an important part of our lives. If he's keeping you away from his friends, that implies to me that you're just not that important a part of his life.

So in short, no it wouldn't be acceptable, and I'm amazed you've let it go on this long. It's not even that he might be hiding anything untoward, it's the fact that he's got this weird compartmentalisation going on. Not even inviting you when they're in town? Ridiculous. That's utterly incompatible with marriage, for a start. You need to start putting your foot down - either you're a part of his life, or you're not. If he's unwilling to include you, even superficially, in the rest of his life, why subject yourself to it? That's not the behaviour of someone in a committed relationship, that's someone with one foot out the door, or just keeping things separate because he's figuring you'll break up sooner or later and wants to keep things clean."
533,"My only concern with this plan is since this woman is willing to leave the baby at the front door, she could assume the OP just isn't answering and the baby could end up left alone."

He also knows about my buddies who all live 5000 miles away and opened a food truck, about J. who got pregnant and about C. who has opened a second café. 

Being that secretive **is** a huge red flag. I mean... Wtf?!"
536,"could be wrong i feel like theres a decent chance he already has some idea that you probably have stretch marks / loose skin since you told him how much weight you lost.  and since he presumably didnt react badly or ask about stretch marks / loose skin when you told him how much weight you lost, he might not care that much about it."
537,"Thank you for answering. I definitely need to choose between those two options, waiting is not one anymore. It's just a sad situation, that's all."

540,"This is what companies do sometimes. If a company loses/lays off workers, they hire someone from a position below and ""promotes"" them. The person gets a pay raise and they end up filling the roles of what sounds like in this scenario, two other people that left. The company saves money and they get all the labor/work done at the same time. The pay increase your boyfriend got is small compared to the one whole or even two salaries that they laid off/lost.

'I'm unsure' and 'This sucks but it's not your fault' are not the same as 'I can't do this a minute longer'. If you're at the point where you're already done with the relationship and just want out, then break up with him. If you're not at that point yet, tell him how you actually feel instead of telling him it's not his fault. Because this *isn't* a situation outside of his control. He *could* get a different job.

547,"&gt; I would rather lose all my stuff than go to her house to get it

This, more than any other part of your post, says it all to me. When a parent is so abusive that you'd rather lose childhood memories than have to talk to them again, it speaks (screams, really) volumes.

Your mother sounds abusive and possibly narcissistic. Have your boyfriend run interference to help you tie up this loose end, then block your mom and sever ties completely.

I was all over the place as I read this one, started at this is a classic “you should have asked, she divorced me for leaving my dishes by the sink” then was like, wait does he have adhd??? Because the level to which he fails to get things done and is paralysed bye failure had me perplexed.

But then the fact that she said he can do this shit at school?? I think this can also be the manifestation of the hyperfocus aspect of adhd but even if it is, he needs to do the therapy to actually try and help, or to get it if he’s actually just crap.

I feel like OP has definitely done more than enough already and wouldn’t necessarily blame her if she was done. Even if this seems salvageable, I don’t think the onus is on her to do that work"
552,"Her post history said she was going through a divorce 9 months ago.

You had her as a mother, imagine being conned into marrying her, what a trip that would be.

568,"Bad thoughts about your body don't just *go away*. You know how you have to exercise to build muscle? You also have to work to get rid of the bad thoughts about your body.

But treating your mind and your emotions well is just as important as treating your body well. 

Just like you can work with a personal trainer to come up with a good exercise plan for your body, you can also work with a counselor or therapist to learn how to change your thought patterns about your body. If you're not ready to jump into that, you can read up on cognitive behavioral therapy yourself, or find a podcast, etc. And just like it takes time to see results with exercise, it also takes time to see results with unlearning your body hatred.

You are still providing them with accommodation. 
You are still wasting your time giving rides to people who are USING YOU. 
You're still providing and covering costs for people who do not care about you.

If he had come out even a few years ago and said, ""You know what, I've decided this is not for me,"" I would say that's the kind of guy one could plan a future with.  You know what's up.

Next time, record every moment and let her know you are recording and that you are going to use it as evidence of abandonment/negligence the moment she walks away from her child. If that friend doesn’t give a fuck, neither should you. It isn’t your problem but it will continue to be if you’re this willing to be a doormat... so much so that I doubt this post is real, but whatever."
579,"Sounds like a red flag for a possessive, jealous boyfriend. I would advise to be careful. Run if you dont trust him."
580,"My wife and I got a courthouse wedding, then did the actual ceremony about 6 months later.

Don’t tell people you’re already married. Just wait for the ceremony and let them show up and go through the motions. At this point, the ceremony isn’t really for you, it’s for your collective extended family.

Just make sure your priest/officiant/whatever knows that the legal part is already taken care of."
581,I would tell your boyfriend and hers about it. Then she'd have to shut up about it. She would really want to betray her boyfriend's trust for some views on YouTube?
582,"&gt;  I’m running out of fight and feel like I don’t even advocate for myself anymore. Just writing this makes me very sad.

It's time to go, OP. 

You've set yourself on fire to keep him warm. Enough."
583,"&gt;It must have been the way I told the story that makes me look like the good guy here 

Did you consider that you actually didn't behave unreasonably here? Your wife threatened suicide (to someone who has lost loved ones to suicide) and then went MIA. It was entirely reasonable for you to panic and contact people."
584,"He doesn’t want to go to therapy because it would require he change, he has no interest in changing. I’m sure when he says, trust me, he means it, in the moment. But it won’t hold, it can’t, because this is his only strategy for coping with his emotions, he’s a thirty four year old man, and his reaction to any emotional challenge is extremely immature and destructive—first he shuts down, then he explodes. That’s all he’s got. That’s the whole menu. 

And he doesn’t care a whit about your distress, it’s white noise, he’s going to complete this same ritualized, developmentally delayed cycle, and you’ll kill yourself trying to find the key to break it."
585,"Addendum... I guess love letters popped into my head because *dudes just don't do that.* And how cool would it be for a teenager with all these confusing thoughts of how to navigate his life and make decisions, and maybe feeling like he doesn't have a model for what his future looks like, to experience his dad doing something he's never seen another adult man do? Kind of normalize the abnormal. Demonstrates the breadth of what masculinity can be (which often seems like a very tiny box)."
586,"&gt; I then called my boyfriend back and told him what he said and I asked him if he would be mad if he came over. I told him that we would sit on the balcony and I would not allow him to come inside. 

This is red flag, frankly. Why did you had to ask permission to talk to someone? And sit on balcony? 

&gt; My boyfriend is still mad and is telling me that I should no longer speak to the cop because there are clearly no boundaries. How should I handle this? Am I in the wrong?

You are not in the wrong. You should think hard about your current relationship, because the new boyfriend seems to be controlling too and you need his permission to talk to cops and friends."
587,"Have a biiiiit of self-respect and dump this guy. Like are you seriously going to write all of that and stay with him? There is really no reason to unless you have a fetish for being treated like a piece of meat. If that's what you want, feel free to stay with this utter loser."
588,"It's unfortunate that it's come to the point that you have to get a job to endure the security of your children.  That's going to be an even bigger hit on his pride than it apparently was before.

You have to do it though, start job hunting and let him know that you are doing it.  Talk about it as much as you have to but let him know that the endgame is that you will be working and he needs to focus on getting a job for himself rather than talking you out of what will be best for your family."
589,"Your boyfriend is a feeder. It's an abusive fetish where men get sexual arousal from fattening up women to the point where they're completely and totally dependent on them.

This is different from actually finding bigger women attractive to start with. They like the act of taking thin to average BMI-sized women and utterly destroying their bodies.

Once the women are incapacitated due to their weight, the feeders will leave them to repeat the process with a new thin woman.

It seems that he picked you for a reason, what with the fact that you're already financially and emotionally dependent on him due to your unemployment and agoraphobia. Now he wants you physically dependent on him as well."
590,"I actually wouldn’t though because that annoying ass person would just say, “Ohhhh go right through my stuff, I don’t care!”"
591,I suspect he also asked out a number of people before he even met you.
592,"The biggest problem I see here is that your husband doesn't care that Mary is rude to you. He... should care about this. And he should tell her to knock it off at the very least. 

I also agree that you should let their relationship fizzle out if that's where it's heading. Having female friends is different from having a female friend who is openly hostile to his wife. Why continue to feed this nonsense?"
593,"Have all my upvotes for getting to the heart of the matter here. 

This

&gt; In comparison to my measly $35 per week in spending money, he has about $300 per week to blow.

combined with this

&gt; he tells me how he lives paycheck to paycheck too, but I just don’t feel like he understands how different our situations are

means this guy is a selfish, unempathetic douche. He is not planning for a future AT ALL (except I guess his 401k??)...never mind a future with her. I would venture a guess that there are a lot of ways in which he is a less than ideal partner in terms of support.

OP -- end it. There were so many red flags but that detail is a nail in the coffin."
594,"So......you can say he’s your boyfriend as long as you perform in a way he likes i.e. don’t have any needs or demands of your own, support him completely and unconditionally  and don’t dare do anything to suggest he compromise his life in anyway for you. You continue to audition for his approval, hoping if you are small enough he will seal the deal with you. The question of whether you are his girlfriend and whether your relationship is exclusive remains unanswered. Then when he sleeps with someone else - of course you can’t be mad! You weren’t really dating, you were never exclusive! And why are you acting so crazy (having your own needs and personality) all of a sudden???

Like girl come on. This is a tale as old as time. If someone wants to be with you, they will make that clear and they will make that happen. If someone doesn’t want to be with you but wants all the benefits of a relationship with none of the sacrifices, they will do this. You deserve someone who enthusiastically wants to be with you, not someone who begrudgingly accepts a boyfriend title to stop you walking."
595,"I would talk to a doctor first before making any big decision. Genital herpes isn't a ""death sentence"" for sex IMO. With protection and being careful about having sex during outbreaks in general, you should be able to have a healthy sex life IMO."
596,"&gt; We have made plans to move in together 

After 4 months? Dreadful idea, *especially* to share expenses, rather than as a natural progression of a serious relationship, which I'm sorry to say after 4 months this is not. That said...

&gt; As someone who isn't my wife, I don't entirely believe it is mandatory to share our financials (yet). 

See, this is the problem. If you're moving in together, sharing bills, taking responsibility for each other...yeah, you kind of need to know where each other stand. The trouble is you're simultaneously saying ""this is only 4 months in so we're not serious enough to share that info....but we're somehow also serious enough to move in together, go on a lease together, whatever"".

So short version is don't move in together yet - it's way too soon, and you need to be on the same page beforehand, which you both clearly aren't. The longer version is if you **are** going to move in together, she has a point that you both need to be open with each other, because like it or not, moving in together ties the two of you together in a pretty serious way. If you're not comfortable sharing your financials, you shouldn't be moving in together yet. It's hard to say whether it's a red flag that she's so insistent on knowing this information, or it's a mutual red flag that you're moving in together at all."
597,He's hiding you from his wife
598,"&gt;You may want to test yourself with 23 and Me for your medical history for the sake of your son.

I'd recommend doing genetic testing with a doctor, not with a service like 23 And Me. Doctors are bound to HIPAA, so they keep all your results confidential, but 23 And Me is a private, for-profit service that is not a HIPAA-covered entity, and they have their users sign a pretty broad legal agreement giving them rights to their data. They sold their genetic database to Glaxo Smith Klein last year for five years, and it's really up in the air who may get it next once that contract expires. That could become a bigger deal if the preexisting conditions ban in the ACA is ever lifted, since insurance companies could theoretically buy this vast library of genetic predispositions of individuals and then use that information to deny insurance coverage.

Not trying to be an alarmist or conspiracy theorist, but I don't think most people are aware of the difference between getting medical genetic tests, along with the legal protections those entail, and doing a novelty service like 23 And Me that can do whatever they want with your data."
599,"Meeting her is a terrible idea. It tells her your husband doesn't respect you enough to shut that shit down, because obviously you talked to him first. It's stooping to the level she wants--no matter what you say to her, she is going to tell everyone you are bullying her because you're jealous.  
  
Honestly, if your husband won't stop emotionally cheating on you, your options are leave him, accept it, keep fighting him and getting nowhere, or go down in flames fighting the wrong person, the last being what it sounds like you've chosen to do. For your own sake, I'd recommend demanding marriage counseling and bail if even that doesn't get him to stop. Don't help these people drag you down."
600,I probably wouldn’t but I’d like to reply with  “who is this and what do you want”.
601,"I was a nanny for a family like that. I actually use to tidy their kitchen during naps but on the days dad was home, he made such a mess that I wouldn’t touch it. It was so nice when he deployed and back to chaos with two hours of him coming home, and he was already out the door to his hobby after briefly greeting the children and destroying the house. Mom always told me we’ll see how my husband is when he’s a dad. Still attentive. Still helpful.,,"
602,"OP, your boyfriend sounds quite unwell. He needs to be linked in with mental health treatment, including therapy, to get to the root of the problem and starting treating it. 

It is hard to have a partner with mental health issues, however these relationships only succeed if the person is willing to participate in mental health treatment and actively look after their health. If he refuses to go into treatment, this will be the end of your relationship. 

For example, my friend has severe depression and her marriage is solid because she's: very preventative (sees a psychologist for 'check-in' sessions, takes medication, has learnt the signs when her mental health is declining and immediately acts), has open communication with her husband - listens/believes him when he expresses concern she's not in a good place, and they have clear plans how they manage child-care/household when she spends time in hospital."
603,I'm getting more and more uncomfortable she has also taken pictures of me without my consent. She's eavesdropped while I'm on calls. Etc. Etc.
604,"I'm not seeing any indication that OP clearly told them that she is not looking for work. In fact, she herself did not expect to stay home when she initially moved back; she and her husband only ""recently"" sat down to talk about it.

I wouldn't write them off as dishonorable right away."
605,"""We were glad to help out, but this will no longer work for us.""

Rinse and repeat.  Have this conversation over the phone or in a public place.  Do not let her into your home to continue the discussion.  

""But *wwhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyy?*""

""Because it will not work for us.""

""But I have to go to work!  Who will watch the baby?!""

""I'm sorry you're in a difficult situation, but we can't help.  It will not work for us.""

""But-but, just a couple of weeks?  Until I can find some place?  You're the only people I can trust!""

""I have every faith in your ability to work something out.  However, this will not work for us.""

*And you end the conversation.*

Will it be tough for her?  Yep!  And will you end up providing unpaid childcare for the next few years if you do not stand up for yourself?  Yep.

Choose wisely."
606,"Don’t trust completely what a man says about his ex lol, especially if there’s a pattern where they’re crazy/dramatic"
607,"&gt;He said that the way I was dressing like a ""construction worker"" was a huge turn off for him, and that he wishes I'd change after work or something, if we'd be hanging out. And that he misses my long nails and well taken care of hands, the way I get grease under my nails and scrapes on my hands is a turn off because they feel mannish... 

I mean, you dress like someone who does hands on work because that's what you do! He's being very superficial, imo. It's fair to ask you to clean your hands real well and get the grease out from under your nails before socializing, but otherwise he isn't being reasonable. I would probably say that if my post-work appearance is unacceptable, that means he's only seeing me on weekends."
608,Thank you.. I just don't know why he would go through the trouble of moving here for all of this to come out. It seems like such a waste.
609,"I also think it sounds very Mean Girl. But there's one scenario where I think it could be okay, and that's if these friends were trying to warn OP, not just make her and the new bf embarrassed. In my old friend group, if a dude had tried to hook up with every girl in the group, we would have let the girl who decided to take his bait know. Not to be mean, just to say, ""Keep an eye out. He could be legit, or he could just be looking for a warm body and you deserve better than that."""
610,"&gt; Now I want you to imagine, REALLY imagine, what it would be like if you had a partner. Not a ""wonderful dad"" (that's about the kids) or a ""hard worker"" (that's about his boss), but a partner (that's about YOU).

This is really insightful."
611,"That’s a bingo. 

Pretty sure this is code for “I want to keep having sex with you and if that title is what it takes, then so be it. I’ve now made it clear to m not going to give her much time or emotional energy and she says she’s ok with that!  Sex and limited emotional needs is a perfect relationship for me”"
612,"Obviously we only get a small window into your relationship, but from what you’ve written this sounds incredibly one-sided. I don’t think your boyfriend is necessarily a “bad” communicator. It sounds like he chooses to stonewall and avoid difficult conversations to postpone them indefinitely. There’s no magic formula that he could use to share his feelings and keep you around, so instead it’s “I don’t know”, “I haven’t thought about it” etc. 

Do you actually want to spend your life with a man who chooses not to spend the time thinking about things that are important to you? Or who puts you off with excuses like that?

My guess is that you’re generally being taken for granted in this relationship."
613,"Yikes. Yeah, document all of this and go to HR anyway."
614,"Her expectations for you to financially support her after just two years, and without being married, are unreasonable and entitled.  

Most grad students work as Teaching Assistants or Research Assistants and/or take out loans.  

Your GF can move home with her folks and take out lians for school.  Case closed.  

If she wants you out of the apartment, contact the landlord about getting the lease changed to just GF's name.  The landlord would need to approve her as the sole tenant and your GF would need to sign a lease release.

Then, you contact the utilities companies and tell them to close your account as of (your last date in apartment).

And, based on your reduced income and her recent behavior,  you should immediately stop covering any extras for her.  She can buy her own groceries."
615,"make sure you send her a text too so theres proof that you're not home and will not take care of the baby. in case if she's stupid enough to leave the baby there and you aren't there, and something happens to the baby it won't be your fault."
616,"You made the right call. 

Growing up my whole family went to church every Sunday and Wednesday. At the same time my father, who was concidered a pillar of the church, was sexual abusing myself and my brother. I put him in prison for it later, but I don't know how many other people he hurt in our time there. 

I am glad there are people like you out there who feel like protecting their kids is more important than ""being polite""."
617,"Don't stay in a relationship with someone who doesn't prioritize you. After 3 years, this is who your boyfriend is. Do you really want to feel like you'll always have to fight for your partner's attention and affection? You deserve better than that. This guy doesn't seem into you at all."
618,"So stop fighting. Not going to them for holidays should be the default. Don't try to set anything up with them. Proactively plan holidays with your family or friends or just the two of you every time. If they ever extend an invitation to both of you, then you can consider perhaps maybe gracing them with your presence."
619,"Do not, DO NOT respond. He gave up the right to express himself to you when he blocked you from his life. Why do for him what he wasn't willing to do for you?

Closure is a bit of a lie sometimes. Maybe you won't ever know why he ghosted you, but you do know he is capable of of it. Sometimes that's all you really need to know."
620,"The only possible way I could see this meeting going well is if you *finally* manage to convince your husband that his behavior is inappropriate, and you and he meet her together as a united front.  Him calling her on her bullshit while you are present and listening could potentially shock her into shutting up - at least for a time.  But that sounds extremely unlikely right now. It’s probably best to cancel the meeting."
621,"F*ng hell, that's brutal, but so true"
622,"I have no idea what your jobs are, but if its that difficult to get a promotion to the position he is in, let him work that position for at least 1 year. Then he has experience to get another job for the same position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you see a future with this guy? If you do, then suck it up and deal with it. What is one year in the grand scheme of the rest of your lives together? 

&amp;#x200B;

He's worked this long, and now he has his opportunity to prove he's able to work in this position. By quitting so soon, his future jobs won't see it as the company treating him like shit. They'll see it as him failing to work to the standard of the new position."
623,"Weve seen this exact post but from the girlfriend's perspective before and people get all ""I would be jumping to show you my phone records and wanting to talk to anyone who can help."" This sub doesnt have a clear stance on this. If I were you I wouldn't kill myself trying to prove something that DIDN'T happen but I wouldnt ben so zen like ""Well if you dont trust me that's on you and you'll regret it some day."" Honestly try to figure out a middle ground. Tell her where you were that night, try to figure out who could be lying to her about this, and maybe show her some evidence if you have any. I wouldnt go too extreme either way on this. Try to work through it. If she seems irreconcilably doubtful of you well then I really am sorry but that's the end of your relationship. Someone achieved their nasty objective."
624,"If you miss the church social aspect maybe you'd like Unitarian churches. I've never been to one where children had to leave during services, and it's a welcoming and non- preachy service. My mother and I are both agnostic but went for the social circle and were welcomed without reservation."
625,"Good for you!  I'm sorry your dad didn't stand up for you before.  I hope he follows through this time.  Even if he doesn't, you seem like an intelligent and insightful person, and I hope you excel so that you won't even need his money."
626,"Firstly I'm sure this is a very difficult situation for you and I feel for you. 

The thing is, if you don't dump him now, you are teaching him that it is okay to disrespect you, and it will only get worse. 

The reason he has been fine for 2 years was because if he was like this at the start, you never would have stayed with him. He has waited until you're attached and you've taken a big step in your relationship, to unleash his real self, with the hope that you will find it too hard to leave. He obviously thinks you have no spine or self-respect. 

Please prove him wrong."
627,"I am very sure your mother has been FINALLY caught saying something so outrageous, her behavior will FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY reap her the consequences she most likely richly deserves.

In no uncertain terms, your Mother shouldn’t receive the love and support of her family until she fully apologizes and after a term, is proved to be truly repentant.

No you shouldn’t step in to make it easier for your Mother. No you shouldn’t be the bridge maker between your sister and your mother.

She should twist alone (short term) in the wind she caused."
628,"Girrrrllll... everything else is good? Peeped your post history and found that:

1. He made you the “other woman” at the beginning of your relationship.
2. You don’t communicate well together. 
3. He has lingering performance anxiety/problems. 
4. AND he is frequently late to everything? 

You should end it. This is not a healthy relationship! You can do better for sure."
629,"I’m sorry for your loss and the situation with the obituary is definitely frustrating. 

But I think it would be very foolish to confront your 85 year old grandparents at the funeral service for their son.

I don’t know what their relationship was like , but grief does not make people more sensible. This is a time where people are going to be behaving imperfectly, so instead focus on supporting those closest to you. If in a few months you want to say something to them about what happened, or how they’ve treated your family in the past, do it then, once things have settled a bit. But do not bring it up at the service. The service for your father."
630,"&gt; I know it's an expectation for women without kids to help out with other people's kids

IMO, at least, it's absolutely not. Just continue to refuse, and hopefully they'll stop eventually. If they don't, you might have to refuse a little stronger; something about not working for free, or that you stopped babysitting when you graduated high school, or even that your lack of having kids is you signaling that you don't want to take care of kids."
631,"First, I don’t disagree with you. You have every right to privacy / security and she has no expectation to receive access to your account  password.

HOWEVER.

I feel like the “I’m going to turn my phone away from you cause I think you’re liable to steal it and do something nefarious” maneuver with your phone was a little over the top.

From your GF’s perspective it probably seemed like you were genuinely suspicious of her intentions, not just that you want that information kept private in general. Which does, in the moment, make you seem like kind of a childish douche.

Make sure this is actually about overall security and not because she feels like you were unnecessarily treating her like she’s a thief."
632,"My situation pales in comparison to some of the other horror stories I've read here, and I can't ""prove"" anything.  

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really want to unfold the entire conversation at the time she came home because I hadn't really sorted through my emotions and we had both been drinking. I knew I was upset, but also knew I couldn't articulate all my thoughts. I'm not saying that I was just casually sitting around, but I held it in so I could have the space to figure out what to say."
633,Yea I'd fuming too if I weren't so effing exhausted.
634,"Don’t apologize, that’s why people come here.

In short, you need to discuss this with him. This is serious, including your feelings. Your fears matter, too. There’s currently a lot of “what if’s”. You don’t know the context behind that text. You don’t know if it’s his baby. You don’t know what would happen if it was his baby. You don’t know if you’re going to be able to handle it or not down the line, and you don’t know if you’re ready to make a decision.

This all relies on you talking with him and taking it a step at a time. Not taking giant leaps, creating unnecessary anxiety in an already stress filled situation."
635,"I hope not, otherwise it means he did, and he doesn’t care."
636,"He's purposefully trying to hurt you. You say he was squeezing your fisted hand so hard that you had already said it hurt ""ow"" is a universal response to pain so there was no way he couldn't understand.

The really telling thing is the use of the phrase ""snapped out of it"". He's seeing how much pain you'll let him inflict. He knows he's hurting you. 

Leave him."
637,"This. And she won’t be a good mother most likely. I have a friend who did this - she has two kids, the second she wanted to abort but her husband wanted to keep it. She does nothing with the kids - they have nannies that essentially raise the kids. In her case, she’s ambitious and creative, would rather focus on that than be a mom. Having kids didn’t suddenly turn her into a mother. She loves her kids, but admits she’d rather not have them. What kind of environment is that for children to grow up in?"
638,"You have two choices.

Either a divorce, or learn to communicate, because holy shit are you clearly incredibly bad at it.

&gt; After selling my motorcycle for $1000, I kept half the money to save for another motorcycle, and the other $500, I put in our bank account for bills. I saved more money for a couple of months and ended up having $1500 saved, completely seperate from our bank acount. I was looking into a new bike, when she freaked out and got angry that I wanted to spend $1500 on a bike. MONEY I SAVED

Okay, but... did you discuss that with her? Because good job saving money, but you're married and have children, so... if that's money that should have been going on family things, she's got every right to freak out at you for it. 

I mean, you're unhappy because she doesn't like you hanging out with your stoner friends, which makes sense, because you're married, and have children, and responsibilities, which means you don't necessarily get to act like you're single any more. She doesn't want you to spend $1500 on a motorcycle, which... may well be justified, because that's a lot of money, and yeah, ""you saved"" it, but what else could that be spent on? What could and possibly should you have spent that money on instead of saving it for a motorcycle?

You need to discuss these things. You need to actually learn to communicate about really a lot of things here."
639,"Warn her in writing, either via text or e-mail, that you will call CPS if she abandons her child on your doorstep again.  Do not open the door for her.  Don't have communication with her outside of text/e-mail.

You need to put your foot down.  Tell your wife the same thing, you both need to be on the same page here.  If you do not get this to stop now she will always see you as the free safety net."
640,"The thing about narcs is that they make up their own narrative that suits them and cling to that no matter what the reality.

Your dad is obviously on board with his wife's narrative that you and your brother are mean and cruel. It does not matter what the reality is. It does not matter what you do. Your father and his wife will continue to believe this as long as it suits them and their narrative.

That's it. Full stop. It's out of your hands.

Now you know there is nothing you can do about their attitude and behaviour, what are you going to do?"
641,"One perspective I want to add as a nonbinary person who has watched a lot of people come out or experiment with gender, some later in life: Sometimes the joy of realizing a new thing about yourself can be so intoxicating that you take it to an extreme for a while. This might not be the case with your spouse, but I've seen plenty of people load up on pride flags, throw out their new clothes to buy new ones, and adopt drastically different mannerisms early into their coming-out, just for it to level out later. This can be complicated by coming out later in life, as older people might feel the need to ""make up for the years lost"" or compensate in some way because nonbinary identities can be seen as some flashy trend for young people (which is very untrue!). I'm not necessarily saying that you should ""grin and bear it"", but just giving some context that big, temporary changes to personalities and behaviors shortly after coming out are not an uncommon thing in my experience.

I would personally feel really uncomfortable with someone wearing my clothes without permission and telling me that body hair is gross, and that is something that should definitely be discussed if you share those feelings. I think these are understandable as part of the ""trial and error"" of understanding how you relate to gender (and thus gender roles and expectations), but that doesn't make it okay. I've also seen people of all genders buy in to misogyny big time after coming out because they feel like that's what they're ""supposed to do"" and that it validates their identity.

Definitely look into support/meetup groups for both of you individually and as a couple, preferably in person (internet support is amazing, but it can only go so far). If you're currently your spouse's only outlet for their gender feelings, then that is going to get quite lonely for both of you very quickly.

Sorry this got kind of long. Feel free to pm me if you want to talk more!"

643,"I don’t know what country you’re in, but just to let you know a lot of senior women who work in male-dominated for companies tend to view younger women as competition. I don’t know if you can ever get her to like you. It would be in your better interest for your professional career to move to a firm that has more women."
644,"She does sound like a germaphobe, and creepy. But dude you touched your dick, wash your hands."
645,"If it means anything, you may have dodged a bullet. I once agreed to take my younger sister to church. The same situation occurred where I was old enough for the adult sermon but I wasn't allowed anywhere near my sister. She seemed to enjoy it so much my little brother wanted to come. Come to find out, not only were they conning my sister out of her school lunch money, but my brother's first and only day in a church he was ignored so bad he peed his pants, was ridiculed by children and staff for it, and I got in a screaming match with the woman on the bus all the way home and my mom joined in after she figured out what happened. Not all churches are that way obviously, but my sister and brother haven't been to one since because of the experience. Kids take things much harder as we all know."
646,"So he doesn't let you exercise or get a fitbit that will encourage you to leave the house, he orders you to eat junk food, he doesn't let you have a say in dinner, he doesn't let you go to bed until he says you've eaten enough... Honestly, this is terrifying. He's either got a fat fetish, or he loves having a housebound girlfriend that he's trying to establish all kinds of control over. You say he pays for everything, so presumably he controls rent, groceries, etc. Think back, has he ever ""encouraged"" your agoraphobia? This seems like an ideal situation for an abuser; someone who physically can't leave them, who is unable to leave the house for work, friends, or activities. I'd be very very carefully considering how to leave this relationship if I were you."
647,"This is abundantly clear. As hard as it is OP you need to do what's best for her health now which involves staying on the same page with your family about her condition. 

&gt; I am not sure if being transparent with my sister/parents is the right move

It is. Objectively the two ""sides"" to this dispute are a 90yo woman with dementia and your entire family. She needs help dearly, unless you can provide all of this help yourself...

&gt;...moving overseas next year

... then your family needs to know everything."
648,"Ya, sounds like classic miscommunication. OP needs to draw a line and clearly tell him that it’s either me or the job. Be relaxed but very firm and serious when you tell him, or he may think you’re bluffing. It’s east to lose sight of reality when you’re working slave labor like that, and it shifts your priorities and brainwashes you."
649,"Things seem really unbalance for you guys. He has more spending money, more ability to buy himself nice things, more free time while you cook for him, more say in where you live...

Where’s your power in this relationship?"
650,"Even if there was no cheating, are you happy being talked to like that?   Is she this disrespectful to you at other times?  Is this the type of thing you think you can move past?   Is it worth it to even try to reestablish trust?   It seems like you could find an easier, more fulfilling relationship."
651,Here's a tip: it's easier to see what doesn't get done and leave him to his chaos if you separate and live in separate households for a while.
652,"Please do not entertain him any longer, he sounds like he never got past a college frat stage and you deserve better communication, attention, better everything. This is manipulation and ""but he's not normaly like this"" is exactly what he wants you to think, to guilt trip you into changing/pleasing him to get him to be nice to you, he said it himself ( for him : sex= better treatment), kind of like ""training""  you. 

we ALL have things to work on and improve , all the time. But you don't treat someone poorly because of it."
653,"&gt; i know he does love me

I’m sorry, but how do you know this? You’re not even a part of his life."
654,"&gt;he knew for over a month he was being evicted

I'm curious if OP has outside verification of this or if her boyfriend told her it was happening."
655,"I wouldn't think its creepy. I think guys don't often get handed numbers by women who are interested. If you slid ehim your number it will take all the guess work out on his part as to whether youre interested in him. Also, if he is not interested he can pretend that he didn't get the hint, and you two can carry on without too much akwardness."
656,So is your friend paying for anything?  I'd call this whole thing off.  Your friend is taking advantage of you and you're being way too willing to accommodate her.
657,Wait why did you do it yourself? Did he make it clear that he hadn't arranged anything?
658,"I don’t even know why you’re on this subreddit asking for advice when the entire situation is black and white. This is someone you need to dump, effective immediately. He clearly doesn’t want you and sounds like he doesn’t even like you. He’s being an asshole and none of what he has expressed or is demanding of you is okay. If he truly is this bad now I highly doubt that this kind of behaviour wasn’t apparent from the start. Why and how have you put up with it for so long? Maybe the distance saved you from his true, abhorrent self? He sounds like a complete Neanderthal. There are ways to discuss and compromise anything in a relationship, including sex... the way he is doing it is nuts. In fact, he’s so abrasive and rude that I have to wonder if he is actually doing everything he can to try and get _you_ to break up with _him_. Like, there’s no way even he can take any of what he said seriously? Either way, it’s over and he’s pretty much telling you that it is. I hope you have enough respect and love for yourself to do right by you and dump his pathetic ass."
659,"Oh honey I’m sorry. My mom died a little over a year ago. Just yesterday my friend answered her phone “hi mama” while sitting next to me and I almost threw up. It’s so painful. Mother’s Day is especially painful. 

Part of our grief journey is dealing with people’s insensitivity. She didn’t say it to hurt you - your loss slipped her mind. Which seems impossible to us. How could anyone forget the biggest, most awful thing to happen?? But they do, and quickly. 

So yes, you could say something and I’m sure she’d be embarrassed and apologize. But this is the first of many innocent, insensitive, hurtful, stupid comments. We have to be strong and work past them (while also being really kind to ourselves). Lots of love to you."
660,"Wow. What a prize.

OP, come on. You know good and well he lied about not wanting to stay long. He's an adult, he can take care of himself, he can find another place to live while this all gets sorted out. Interesting that he blames you for his own assumptions and his own fuckup here, don't you think?"
661,"&gt;So now he’s mobile

Yeah but his knees are still bad and he's still ruining them. He just can't feel it right now.

Next time, tell him to go get his own pizza. Stop enabling him and let him sulk it out."
662,"First, you weren't TRYING to look at her face. You saw them getting it on and looked away, both times. Second, you're not friends with her, what reason would you possibly have to NOT tell your boyfriend about it? None. Explain that to him. He's being unreasonable."
663,Wow. So sad that she had to say that for him to wake up.
664,"Really important that ""you"" time is scheduled in there for you to pursue hobbies and alone or social time as well. He can't see you as a fixture in the house with your child.. he needs to see you as another independent adult who isn't just on standby to take on all responsibility and wait around for him.

The time he gets to pursue his hobby should be matched by time that you get out of the house, or bearing no responsibility in the house. That will help him develop some empathy, and help decrease resentment on your part."
665,"""Our plan right now is for husband to work, and for me to be the primary caregiver. Our job arrangements and our transportation are working great for us right now, and we're exactly where we want to be. Please stop sending me job opportunities, I'm not looking to work outside the home right now.""

That is the kindest way you can say it, and then you wait and escalate from there, including asking your husband to run interference."
666,"If you don't enjoy it, don't participate. Switch it something boring.

""Speaking of a haircut, should I schedule you one? I heard about this new barber shop downtown that I've been meaning to tell you about..."""
667,I’m so sorry. That hurts. I don’t know what else to say except they suck. People should never confirm and then not show.
668,WOAH WHAT?  You’re not being hypersensitive.  You’re not even being sensitive.  That’s fucking creepy and unacceptable.  I would be very upfront with him about how this is not okay and needs to stop immediately or you’ll file a sexual harassment charge against him.
669,"Read up about reactive abuse. Narcissists love it. They push you repeatedly and when you snap at breaking point they use it as 'proof' you are the problem not them because they were 'just asking and then OP started swearing'.

It's a classic toxic manipulation technique closely allied to the narc 'not knowing what you mean unless you say it in exactly the tone, words and way they choose to understand which also exempts them of any criticism.' It is the estranged parent who has no idea why their child doesn't speak to them and when outsiders ask 'they just wish they knew so they could fix it' but never try in reality.

You will never out manipulate a manipulator so the only way to play is not to play and to outshine them by being a decent person. Stop trying to get the approval of a shitty person and rise above them. Grey rock is the best answer if you can't cut all contact but you can't change them.

Being an asshole works for these people and they aren't going to give up being King of the Asshole Kingdom for a lowly subject like their ki I'm afraid."
670,"I’d just say “thank you! sorry, who’s is this?” It’s not noticeably passive aggressive and looks like you legitimately deleted his number."
671,"You're not an equal partner in this relationship, so you need to start reclaiming your time. What I mean is, this relationship is supposed to work for both of you but right now it only works for him. So you need to start carving time out of the family cycle to be yours &amp; yours alone, and finding ways to direct the family's energy towards your ends as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The first part of that, is you're seeing your own therapist. I agree strongly with that, it was going to be my first suggestion until I saw it was already happening. If he can't take the time for himself then you have to just let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, you should seriously consider finding a thing you can carve out as yours. He's doing this right now - carving out all kinds of ""him time"" - some personal, some professional (teaching) some para-professional (after-school coaching, other school activities). So find an activity, outside the house &amp; outside of work, that's yours. He has the kid that night, he's responsible for dinner, he's responsible for cleaning and bedtime. 

Find a hobby, an activity, a group, that's not his. I'd start with a team sport like roller derby or dodgeball, something that you can take as seriously as you care to; but where other people will be both supporting &amp; relying on you. Then your practices are your time and he has to deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I'd say that you never want to make an ultimatum in a relationship, because your only hostage is the relationship itself. However, **he's already taken the relationship hostage - your options right now are to either carry all the weight in it or leave it.** So it's probably best to put terms to your ultimatum: He has six months to shape up, or you move out."
672,"I really want her to let it all go to shit. But as a very neat person this would be a form of punishment, so I completely understand the inability to do so. I can't even work when my house is messy let alone get some rest."
673,"This person isn't your friend and you should stay away from him. He is getting the distance he needs to move past his feelings for you. Respect that desire for distance and tell your husband about what happened between you and Jeff. Trust me, you want him learning it from you than finding out some other way.

Let's reverse the situation and stay that you had a female best friend called ""Jeffina"" that turned out to have a crush on your husband. Would you want your husband keeping the fact that ""Jeffina"" confessed her feelings to him from you?"
674,"Dude, stop trying to fix your dad. It's not going to happen. If you don't like the person your dad is, you have no obligation to have a relationship with him. You have to accept that you cannot help people who are not interested in helping themselves. Your mom isn't interested in leaving your dad and you can't convince her to do so. Help your brother by helping him become independent of your parents. The only thing that you can truly control is yourself and your own actions and nothing you will do will get your family away from your dad if they don't want to get away from your dad."
675,Do not get married to this man until you get on the same page regarding finances. This sounds like a perfect opportunity to get premarital counseling to get on the same page before you tie the knot.
676,"This family are enablers. It'll never stop and she will always be their ""princess"". I would consider leaving this toxic situation, it can't be healthy for you to deal with this for life can it?"
677,This is what stopped me from saying anything. I believe her when she says I’m the only one who knows and I’m scared for her that if I back away she’ll never tell another person and things will get worse for her.
678,"""Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to be responsible for X, Y, and Z. You are responsible for A, B, C. If you don't take care of A, B, C, I am not going to do it. I will not rescue you. If you want help with something, ask me. But don't assume I'm going to take care of it"".

AND THEN DO THAT. Let him know what's going to happen, and then *let it happen*. Natural consequences are the only way some children learn."
679,"You're 18 and I suggest two things.

The 1st? It's great to have a first adult relationship. You need to have that experience. But now that you have and its not going so great, its not the end of the world to GTFO at the first sign of something in the relationship proceeding in a way you aren't happy with. Most likely she wants this guy around and isn't outright telling him she has a boyfriend because she likes the attention. It's a year but its actually not that long in the grand scheme of things. Maybe you are just being insecure, but they obviously have an inappropriate relationship going on here and you're too young to have to sit and struggle through this. 

2nd? You're long distance and that's really hard to maintain. Especially as an 18 year old guy with not much ability to go see her because you're in school. Long distance is ridiculously hard even when you have enough money to close that distance regularly. 

Go out there and enjoy being 18-22. Find a local relationship if you're not the type to go out and ""sow your oats"". Life is way too short and you're going to have to spend a ton of your time working and building your career in your late 20s to 30s and beyond for you to have to waste a minute of when you can be more carefree in a situation like this.

As someone twice your age I will tell you what my regret is when it came to relationships.

You might spend a bunch of money on someone, have belongings in common, or lose a bunch of money pursuing being with them. You can always earn that money back.

You might have invested a lot of emotions into that person. You learn to love them over a period of a year and all those emotions become the memory of a person you will probably never see or even speak to again. But you will find someone you care for just as much, if not more than that person and will always experience that love and those emotions again.

The one thing you can never get back is time. I spent my early to mid-twenties with someone who I found didn't really love me, but was just so fucked up in the head she was too afraid to be alone. I was absolutely in love with this girl and thought we were soulmates and would end up married at some point. She definitely did not treat me like someone she loved as much as she claimed. The one thing I regret is that I spent from 20-25 with her and those were the years I was supposed to be out there living life up and having fun before I became saddled with a ton of responsibility. Every minute you spend having to worry about this guy when she won't end their friendship is a minute you can never get back.

Go out there and enjoy the life of an 18 year old. Don't spend another second having to worry about this situation. Chances are this is going to be the guy she is going to date because you guys are long distance and only 18 anyways."
680,"That also teaches kids that it's mom's job to do the shitty, boring, daily bullshit of adulthood plus be the drill sergeant / disciplinarian, while dad gets to be the cool!fun!so awesome!dude!

&amp;#x200B;

That is a shit relationship dynamic."
681,"You can just tell her that. But honestly, this girl, or at least her family, are hardcore culty fundamentalist ""Handmaiden's Tale"" level of Christianity. If she's expected to take a chaperone on dates, you guys will probably be expected to get married before you can kiss. And you'll have to join her church to do that, of course. Is all that really something you want in your life?"
682,"I have a suggestion: usually people are advised to use ""I feel"" statements when talking about something someone else has done, like ""I feel bad when you do x"". 

Since your boyfriend is applying asshole logic to these situation, ""I feel"" statements are not going to work. 

Instead, try to make statements about what you find acceptable/not acceptable, not ok to do, etc. ""That was a rude thing to say"" ""I don't consider that ok behaviour in a relationship"". 

See how he responds."
683,“How do I fundamentally change my boyfriends personality to be what I want him to be?  He’s amazing other than his entire personality “
684,Some people are so avoidant of conflict they will start a million conflicts with their loved ones just to avoid that one conflict. This is what I'm seeing. Tell her your roommates feelings aren't the important ones and neither is their wallet. Talk to the roommate that you're getting annoyed with the grocery stealing.
685,"You would be perfectly justified in breaking up with him.

I don’t know if you want kids, but this kind of guy makes a shit father as well as a shit partner. Plus I bet he does nowhere near his share of housework since he “needs”  to spend all his free time playing."
686,"A lot of women fall into this role but it can become a really unfair place to be. That is you doing a lot of work to maintain relationships that should be his responsibility. Then again, if contact with them is something that you value and he doesn't, then maybe you're right to do the work yourself.

Does he not care about keeping in touch, or does he prefer a more distant relationship with his family? I tried to manage contact and connection with my husband's family for years, but he didn't appreciate it because he didn't want it. When I let go of it we were all better off, even though we have much less contact with his family."
687,"He NEEDS therapy. I don't know what else to say. At this point? I would make it an ultimatum. If he wants to keep this relationship with you, he needs to start working on this. It's not an option. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also just so you know? Him purposefully hurting you when he is hurt? Is abuse. And even though you feel like you can handle it? It's going to eat away at your since of self."
688,"You are an adult - and I sort of feel you should be responsible for your own stuff. She needs your stuff out - maybe this stuff is a way of getting into contact with you, but also it shouldn't be Mom's responsibility to decide if it should be kept or discarded. Text her, apologize for the non-response and you'll be over on XYZ day at ZYZ time to pick up your belongings and do not bring them to your work. While gathering your things if she dredges up the past just say ""mum, let's have a pleasant time here and save that for another day""  Picking up your belongings doesn't mean that your relationship is ""back on"" - it just means you're clearing your stuff out of her way.  I prefer to have closure if I was ending a relationship and after packing up my stuff I would want to say ""Mum, you are looking well. I'm going to keep my distance since we can't seem to get along so I wish you well in your new house. This is my plan to repay the money I borrowed from you, thank you for lending it me."" And then you leave. You'll feel better that you have your stuff, you'll feel better that you have a plan in place so you'll be free from the burden of your debt, and you didn't let the contact dissolve into fighting so if you see her in passing down the line at a wedding or baby shower there is no grudge or bad blood on either side. You move on with life with no contact other then a Venmo email address payment once a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

You also tell your boss that your Mom has gotten this idea in her head she should drop off belongings at work - you've asked her not to, but just in case she drops by to please text you."
689,"I don't see how he has a leg to stand on. What's he going to do? Go to your boss and say, ""u/throwaway_FML123 won't give me the time of day when I respond to her work-related emails with whines about my shitty personal life?"" How do you think dragging his business into the workplace would make *him* look?"
690,"You realize if your Great Aunt used Reddit that her post would read a lot like yours, right? ""How to Tell a Beloved Relative that Her ""Dark"" Performative Behavior is Annoying?"" And then she would write all about how her young relative is lovely, but so freaking emo and takes themself way too seriously. Sh'ed probably complain you can't take a joke. She'd mention how once you got so worked up over something that you literally got so hysterical that she even considered taking you to the ER.

&amp;#x200B;

You and her are just different. That's okay. I love my mom more than I could ever begin to articulate. I also find some parts of her sense of humor SO ANNOYING. Like...truly cringe. And you know what? She's allowed to be cringey. She's allowed to happily tell jokes that make me wanna roll my eyes. She's also allowed to BE HERSELF because we're allowed to just be different from each other. She's my FAMILY. I've known her my whole life. Do I think I'd become besties with a random stranger that shared her exact same sense of humor? Absolutely not. But she's not my friend. She's my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be a bully to your Great Aunt. She's not being pretending to be cute, she's just...having her own personality. And yes, her personality includes a sense of humor that features a lot of performative bits. So what?  It doesn't cost you anything to humor the poor lady. Either spend less time with her if these jokes grind your gears so much... or just get over yourself and accept that you two are just different people and that's okay."
691,"As someone married to a wonderful man who still struggles with similar issues to OP: it's easy to say that! But a lot of gendered norms don't come out until careers get extra demanding, or you start having kids. 

Marry the best guy you can find, but don't think you won't still be fighting this battle, either directly with him, or his family's expectations, or society's in general. It's a problem that goes deeper than we realize."
692,"Now that you’ve had a little bit of time, actually write out that list of what you do every day.  It’s a good thing to have going into that conversation.  Also have a list of all the things you need from the agents that you can’t work without.  Perhaps suggest streamlining the process so the agents to have actually fill out trackable request forms and you have a turn around time of X days.  That way there’s none of this hunting down the information.  No request form?  Not your problem.
I know this doesn’t fix all of the problems, but it’s a fix for the one issue where everything blew up."
693,"Run don't walk to get your daughter. CPS has already told you your daughter is being hurt and you don't want to believe it (it's possible that the abuse is happening by someone with access to your daughter, like a boyfriend). You can get support and therapy for your daughter. But at this point you need to get her to safe living environment. That is horrible to have to deal with. So sorry."
694,Then she pulled the “If you don’t come back and study what I want you to I will quit treatment and just die.” Sounds to me like she married on par with her own character. I can’t imagine being a mother and pulling that kind of shit on my kid. OP’s mom sucks.
695,A few appointments with a counselor sounds like a good idea. It's sometimes hard to have sit down one on one conversations with him. Thank you for your time!
