0,"This is definitely a self esteem issue. You can't say or do anything to fix it because she is telling herself she is fat. All you did was say something that she was able to use to justify her self hate. You can tell her until you are blue in the face that she is beautiful and desirable, but if she doesn't believe it, she won't hear you. It could actually be a little bit of post partum depression. Have a real sit down chat with her. Ask her to sit down with you and discuss her body issues with you and tell her it concerns you that she is so hard on herself. If she exercised a lot before, she may have always had this complex and being pregnant took that control away from her. Counseling may be in order here. "
1,"I’m a certified rehab counselor, and I work with people with disabilities daily. You see this sort of a thing a lot in people new to disability or mental health studies. They want to “diagnose” or “treat” every person they come across. Constantly. 

Your friends are being inappropriate. I would tell them exactly why you’ve been limiting your time with them so they know and have a chance to learn. I would also explain that if their behavior continues, they won’t be your friends much longer. 

What they’re doing is attempting to define your boyfriend; who he is and what he is capable of.That’s none of their business. He’s a person who happens to have a disability. It doesn’t define him. 

This simply isn’t any of their business, and it’s inappropriate, to boot. "
2,"Snitching to your boss is 100% the best way to handle this.

Keep a record of the shitty things they to do you and bring it to your boss. Sounds like you work with a bunch whiny brats."
3,"Wow that is terrifying. I WOULD tell your friends, because I think there's a very good chance that he will stalk or hack them to keep tabs on you. I would also make a police report."
4,"""I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us"" - Phyllis, The Office

That's legit what my first thought was upon reading this. You deserve someone who instills in you the faith that they would pick you over anyone else. "
5,"On the one hand, I understand that if you're part of a team that has to work together, it can be frustrating that not everyone is there at the same time. On the other, it's part of your company's culture and rules that you are allowed to make your own schedule, and they have the same option you do. It's time to talk to your boss and say that you aren't able to get work done with your team members because they've taken you off communication platforms and ignore you- you don't have to say WHY this is happening, just give them the facts: your coworkers are refusing to work with you, which is not good for the team or the company. He can help them get in line. "
6,"Your (ex) boyfriend is so in the wrong it’s breathtaking. Thanksgiving happens every year, family member funerals (thankfully, hopefully) are rare and meaningful moments. To be so petty as to break up with you about it just shows how immature and disrespectful he is.

Now, personally I’m a big travel person and I believe in the mentally and emotionally beneficial powers of travel. I won’t say enjoy your trip, given the main purpose of it, but I hope you see beautiful things. I hope you have loving moments with your family and with the memory of your aunt. I’m sorry for your loss, but I’m happy for you that you got to say goodbye. Safe travels, and your ex is a douche."
7,"&gt; Fiance9Years : ""*...He pretty much made no income for the past 6 years... I have a stable career and was able to support us. I paid for everything and tried to be supportive through our darkest times. This year, everything changed. He and his partners secured a major investor... He's already packed... he said he was in love with someone else. His friend's little sister. Who is 23...*""

It's a serious character flaw when someone who has been down-on-their-luck &amp; dependent on others suddenly gets a boost of confidence from a lucky break and starts acting like they're too good for the people who carried them. How many stories/books/movies have there been with that theme?

Don't you dare give another thought to the possibility of ever taking him back. He showed his true colors, and you deserve better. He &amp; his new lover are in for a rude awakening when the honeymoon phase is inevitably over and when his luck inevitably takes another turn for the worse.

You've been strong enough for 2 people for years, so I have every confidence that you are strong enough to get through this. I wish you the best of luck."
8,"&gt; my husband has cheated on me a couple of times before

...and you're still with him, *why*?

Yes, of *course* he's cheating on you again.  You have taught him by your actions in staying with him after his *previous* cheating that there will be no meaningful consequences for his infidelity.

This is who he is.  If you stay with him, this is your life from now on."
9,"There’s a much bigger issue here.  Talk about buried lede. 

You’re focusing way too much on the broken trust of pregnancy reveal.  

The bigger issue is his casual but suggestive chats with a coworker that he isn’t shutting down.  You need to speak to him about this. 

I get it. It’s easier to focus on the thing you already pre agreed on.  But come on, you’re EIGHT WEEKS pregnant and he’s complaining to some chick he works with about your pregnancy hormones.  He’s doing that to get the response of “well I’d never be like that!”  He seems to be trying to flirt. 



"
10,"Your husband may be confusing ""needing more"" with ""needing help"". I agree with your sentiments - if you can afford to put food on the table, you don't beg someone else to do it for you.

I'd be concerned because others may think your husband is intentionally misrepresenting your situation for financial gain - including your employers. Especially when they hear about your vacation."
11,"Screenshot the texts, tell Sara about your date (and your reservations about his mental well-being), and show her the screenshots. She is the owner, she has the right to refuse service if she feels someone is a threat to other customers. You also say they have a ""parental"" role to you; someone in that role would likely want to protect you.

Don't blame her for setting you up (it doesn't sound like you took much convincing, so his facade of normalcy must be pretty good), and don't demand she ban him from the store, but explain that you aren't comfortable around him and let her take the lead and see what she does.

As for Derek, block him. Don't try to be his friend after he has already harassed you."
12,"Your friends are annoying armchair academics, and it's becoming such an issue that your boyfriend (understandably) no longer wants to be around them. They must be pretty fucking obtuse to be deaf to all this.

I'd just tell them this the next time they bring it up:

""Hold on, let me stop you right there becuase I really need to address that comment once and for all. You need to stop harping on BfsName not having a leg and telling us what he ""needs."" The irony is that you are reducing him to a missing leg instead of an individual by making his leg all you focus on. His friends don't treat him differently because of it, but you do. Maybe you're not as open-minded as you think if all you see is the missing leg, and assume that something ""must be wrong"" if he's not moping and doing his best impression of a bitter Lieutenant Dan. I have told you time and time again, and this is the last time I'll say it: drop the subject and treat him like the person that he is, or we can't continue to be friends."""
13,"She has no legal recourse to get money back from you. Tell her to leave you alone, ghost them both and keep all communication for the purposes of a harassment complaint.if necessary. "
14,Just keep up the saving and your plan. Don't let anything he says or do change your plans at all. He's a drug addict and an overall shitty person. Anything said or done is just to keep the status quo. Even if he does manage to change maybe that will benefit his next relationship but yours is over because lack of respect for you and you not being able to trust him is a complete deal breaker 
15,"Girl, go find you some cheap hostels and Air BnBs and have a great time without him. He's either a catfish or an asshole, so don't waste another minute on him."
16,"All of this sounds super suspicious. I’d wager this ex-girlfriend 1) wasn’t in a car crash and 2) isn’t an ex. I’d reach out to him and tell him you’re really hurt he canceled after he knew you had booked travel, that his responses to you have raised some red flags, and that this “relationship” is no longer working for you.  

Since you paid for the flight and Ireland is awesome, I’d suggest going and making it a solo adventure. Traveling alone can be very rewarding. If you decide to go, I hope you have a great time. 

"
17,"Cheyenne and Josh obviously have feelings for each other. 

-She knows his locker combo, but he insists on meeting her there every morning to unlock it for her. He's basically looking for an excuse to see Cheyenne.


-She went to that mixer instead of just dropping him off. He knew that the mixer was mostly couples. Instead of thinking about how it was a great opportunity to spend some quality time with you, he took it as an opportunity to spend some quality time with her. 


-He doesn't have time for your dates, but has time to watch movies with her. Pretty self explanatory. You're not important enough to take time out of his schedule to see. Cheyenne is important enough to take time out of his schedule to see. 


-He leaves your dates to pick up Cheyenne, instead of letting Cheyenne know that she's going to have to drive herself. He would rather go out of his way to do Cheyenne a favor than spend time with you. 


I'm sorry, but even if they don't admit it, they want to be together. You are basically the other woman. Honestly, you deserve better than him. There's really no good way for you to deal with this because if you express your discomfort, they will paint you as the jealous girlfriend that just doesn't understand their friendship. 

Plus, you're a month in. You should be in the honeymoon period right now, but instead your boyfriend sounds like he's in the honeymoon period with his roommate. "
18,"Could she possibly mean that the act of marriage was only for kids? Like she doesn’t care about the piece of paper, and only did it because she felt like society wouldn’t approve if she had kids out of wedlock?"
19,"Just tell him he needs to tone it down. No girl probably had the guts too, so he keeps going on thinking he sounds like Romeo. If he gets offended meh, you really want to be with a guy who can't take criticism? I was the same way in elementary school til a girl told me I was trying too hard."
20,"Agree with everyone on how OP's wife might be depressed on how she looks and she might have a little post partum depression.  
However, I disagree with the comments that OP should talk about he is ""okay"" with how she looks now, because that's admitting she is fat, as she thinks she is..  
The most non-invasive way to help this out is OP should help to his wife to recover to the person she was, and let her have a little time to breathe. Suggestions below:

* Volunteer to take over some of the chores that Wife is currently doing, so she will have an hour free for herself.
* Offer to look after the kids and the house on OP's off day so that Wife can take some time-off to hang out with her friends.
* It might be a while since she pampered herself to a holiday, maybe take her on a short trip, or pay for a short trip she can go on her own.
* Get some one to help with the kids and take Wife out on a date night, buy gifts and flowers for her, and pretend that you are dating again

With lots of love and attention hopefully Wife will return to her normal self again :) Try not to mention about her weight again.  
"
21,"No, you’re not overreacting. Your husband is dreadful when it comes to sticking up for you. Try a marriage counsellor. You could also try saying this: “I don’t want to wait for Tom to disrespect me again for you to finally do something about it. I don’t want to be disrespected anymore, not by you or by him. I’ve had enough of that already. I want you to call him out so that he won’t feel like he can be cruel again.”"
22,"Yeah, ask her to reimburse for all you have spent on them and then you’ll return. She will go MIA probably "
23,There is no way I would stay with someone after saying all that shit to me. A funeral is NO excuse. 
24,Isn't it convenient that all your trash took itself out like this? Time to find better people.
25,"You can also go with the good old fashioned forwarding the last e-mail you sent and CCing their boss when they haven't responded.

""Hey Jim,

Still waiting on your response to this e-mail I sent last week.  See below please and respond by COB.  Thanks!"""
26,"Hey. I am so sorry. That must be so hard to hear. 

A few thoughts:

-If you were my friend, I would tell you to break up with him. This does feel like something that is hard to get over. Even with a lot of reconciliation, you will always have that worry in the back of your head.

-You DESERVE someone for whom you are their great love. You DON'T need to settle for someone who has a ""one that got away."" NOT everyone has that (and don't let him make you think that!) Most people have exes, but many people do the hard mental and emotional work to get past them, which he has clearly not done. He is instead putting that on you.

-Just because he is hung up on his ex, DOESN'T mean that he doesn't love you a lot, and that all those amazing feelings of love, and all those nice firsts, weren't real. I still think you should break up, but I don't think you should feel like you were lied to. As I said, he never did the hard work to get over his ex, so he is in a weird and confusing place. That doesn't mean your love was a lie.

From a practical sense, give yourself lots of TLC. Spend some time apart from him, even if you're not sure what to do next. Lean on friends, even if it's vulnerable to tell them you feel rejected. 

Sending you love and good vibes through the internet, I can only imagine how hurt you feel. You WILL feel better in the future, you WILL find someone who can love you without being hung up on an ex and you WILL find a way to be grateful for the ups and downs of this relationship in the future! It just doesn't feel like it now, but I truly believe that. "
27,"&gt;I feel guilty for having freedom and doing what I want. 

He was already warping your thought patterns. I'm so glad you got out."
28,Maybe show him this thread? Your husband is being ridiculous. He needs to put you and his child - his family - first. His brother has been awful and should be apologising to you directly. 
29,"""I was interested in pursuing something more, and you weren't. That's cool, that's your choice and I respect it. But I treat potential romantic interests different than friends, and I can't invest all my spare time in someone if it's not going to go anywhere. I still like spending time with you, and want to hang out, but I have other friends and other priorities too. This is what friendship looks like to me, and I hope that's enough for you, because I'd hate to lose you as a friend."""
30,You’re only 22. Someone certainly could. It’s just not this guy. 
31,Your mother would be very proud of you.
32,"This, a thousand times, this. I delivered baby number three a year ago and my husband is just like you, super devoted and wonderful and he loves my body at every size. I have been 135-200lbs and everything in between. I’m busting my ass at the gym to get back to a weight I am happy with. His delight in my body, while sweet, has very little impact on how I feel about my body. You need to have a conversation with her. Because she is punishing you for how SHE feels about her body and that’s not okay. I say this from a place of love. She needs to confront and make some changes. She’s what, pretending she hasn’t gained weight and knowing she really has? I did the same thing. After baby number two was born I lost 60 pounds because I was tired of feeling bad about my appearance. Your wife needs to recognize that she’s in a bad place mentally, and take steps to fix it. Maybe that’s a counselor, maybe she wants to get back to the gym. Don’t suggest these things just support her in what she needs to do, whatever that may be. You sound like an amazing husband (like mine) and in the end I made the change for him so that I could accept and receive his love with an open heart. "
33,"I’m going to piggy back off of this comment and say that they really need to understand how inappropriately they are behaving. Even if he was disabled, most people who have a disability or other sort of impairment do not want to be constantly pointed out as being disabled, they don’t want to think about it non stop. 

I’m recovering from surgery and have other mobility challenges due to incredibly hyper mobile joints. If someone sees me struggling with a door, I don’t mind someone holding the door for me. But I wouldn’t want to go to dinner and spend the entire evening being informed how tough my mobility challenges make things. 

OP’s friends only see the “disability,” they don’t see the person. I hope that they aren’t permitted to have any professional interactions with anyone with disabilities until they learn manners. "
34,"Honestly; Have a fight.

Cat vomit in every room? The garbage not touched for weeks? And you're about to have a small child?

Pick a damn fight already. You've tried calmly explaining the issue. He's not hearing you, so speak louder and use clear language: This is disgusting. He has failed you and your child and your pet in a massive way. That is what happened. Be clear to be kind. He will find it unkind, but it will be true.

Then tell him you will both be making time for counselling, so you can address your legitimate rage in as healthy a way as possible, and so that he can come to realize that he will be expected to change his behavior if he wanted this marriage to survive."
35,Welcome to the real reason he finds your patch un-sexy.  
36,"You didn't change your number. Your mother had the ability to pick up the phone and dial you at any time to make amends. She chose not to.

You don't feel sad because your brain knows that if your mother genuinely wanted to talk to you, she would have."
37,"You sound like a good son.  Maybe I'm too sensitive myself, but I wonder if your dad is homophobic and perceives your behavior as indicative of being gay.

The hard truth of the matter is that you're not going to be able to change your father.  My advice is to study hard so you can get scholarships and save all the money you can in an account your parents can't access so you can leave shortly after high school graduation.  Considering joining school activities so you're out of the house as much as possible.

Nursing is an excellent career and you should be able to get an affordable degree.  Start looking now into what programs are available at local community colleges and state schools.  

I'm sorry you're going through this."
38,"&gt;I should go back on the pill because he doesn't want to see the patch all the time.

You know what's pretty non-invasive and doesn't require him to see a patch? A vasectomy. 

If he's not willing to do anything about his sperm, then he doesn't get to whine about having to see a goddamn patch. Come on. "
39,you should go to the police anyway your ex might not stop.
40,"Practical advice: if anything like this every happens again, take the kid to a Dunkin Donuts or a library and hang with them until the ""final word"" comes through. Don't drive her around in circles, and encourage her to CALL family members, not text. Also, this could be harsh, but maybe he can just drop her at the first place. Sure, it's a little cold to leave someone on a front porch, but perhaps he can be like ""okay, aside from the family clusterfudge, where's a place close to your home I can drop you? A friend? Family member? Church? Rec center?"" 

He drops her there and she walks home later when the cluster gets sorted out (I assume she has a permanent home *somewhere*) and end of story. "
41,"&gt; if i won't stop being friends with her then I'm ruining the family. 

Nope, you can be friends with whoever you want. If he makes a big deal about it, *he's* the one causing drama. Your friendship with her doesn't have to impact his life in any way whatsoever.

&gt; I'm not just going to listen to him slag her off so we get into screaming arguments now 

That said, there's a middle ground between listening to him rant about her and having a screaming row. Change the subject, change seats, walk away. You don't have to listen to him, but you don't have to argue back either. Look up the grey rock technique. He doesn't have to like you being friends with her, but you don't have to fight about it either. Stay calm, stay reasonable, bluntly, let him strop off if he wants to, but make it all be on him. Then he's the one missing out on family events and you can keep living your life.

&gt; I've already had to cancel a bunch of times because she's not invited to anything anymore 

I don't quite get this though - OK, she's not invited to family events, which makes sense, why does that mean you have to cancel things? We've all got limited free time and have to allocate it sparingly between friends and family."
42,"If you are unwilling to disconnect from your father for the sake of tuition, you have found a price tag for your willingness to enable your father. That's your prerogative. People like your father are not the types to change, so you have to deal with this or cut him out. You have to work around him.

Dealing with this - 
1) don't ever accept a job offer or internship he applied for. You can contact them and rescind your applications without him knowing. You can turn down offers without him knowing. 

2) Monitor your credit closely. You may need to freeze it at some point if he opens a bank account or CC in your name. You might want to lock down every possible email address that your first/middle/last name combination could be used for as well, since he'll probably make fake email addresses that seem like yours. 

2.5) Put passwords on EVERYTHING in your life. Every administrative thing you have to do - your school department, counselor, your doctor's office, etc, you need to warn them that you have an intrusive parent and you need your privacy LOCKED DOWN. Use HIPPA and FERPA liberally. 

3) Send him a cease and desist letter to cover your butt. You don't need a lawyer to do so. Google templates for it and have it delivered by certified mail. It will help you legally as documentation that he did not have your permission to apply to things as you.

4) Learn how to grey-rock. Give him as little information about your life as possible. Be boring. 

5) Spend your last two years of college preparing to cut your dad out if you are serious about wanting to be free from his control. Save for your first lease, get your important documents in order (birth certificate, social security card, passport, stuff like that). 

6) Check out r/raisedbynarcissists or r/justnofamily"
43,"You asked what you have left. First of all, a good heart, loyalty and decency, unlike your ex. Then, you are still very young and not “middle-aged” at all (that starts at 45). A great career, it seems. And you have been saving up money to buy a home. I also predict that your ex will realize what he’s done and will try to take you back in a few months but I hope you will be wise enough to see that that would be a huge mistake. You will find someone better."
44,"I would remind you that *he* made it about your hair and makeup and not about his uncle's funeral.

And unless he's dapper Dan 24-7, he needs to check himself. A person can let their hair be natural and still be put together. I think I'd give it a day and then request an honest conversation with him. Like ""where was all that coming from?"" A person can have preferences. I prefer my SO clean shaven, but when he lets his beard grow out, I don't hound him about it. It's his face...I'm not going to be suddenly unattracted to him because of some facial hair."
45,"I think your choice of career is awesome and admirable. You might not make tons of money but you’ll make a difference in the kids’ lives. Unfortunately your family might never come around, but hopefully they do. But you have to do what’s best for you. You can’t live your life for other people. I hope my son has a teacher as passionate as you one day!"
46,"It's probably a fungal infection. Since the over the counter meds aren't working she needs to see a doctor,  preferably one with expertise in tropical medicine. 

She could end up with permanently disfigured feet and toenails. If she plans on wearing sandals ever again,  she really needs to get it checked out. 

There is also a chance that it's communicable and she should get it treated before you or someone else catches it.  Perhaps that's the angle to take? Does she care about your wellbeing?"
47,"Does he realize that if someone from his job sees your social media and sees that you're not exactly struggling that it would cause a shitstorm at his job? Or if he mentions whatever vacation you go on someone can put 2+2 together?

His coworkers will stop trusting him because they will understandably feel lied to. He'll be lucky if he isn't bombarded with ""I want my donation back!"" constantly when this blows up on him. And it will blow up on him. This kinda shit always does.

Maybe frame it as ""this can obliterate professional relationships"" type of problem since his privilege googles are on a bit tight.

edit: I just realized you work at the same place. Yeah you gotta nip this in the bud. Maybe talk to HR yourself and tell them it's ok? Because now both of your professional relationships are at stake and companies don't really appreciate being ""lied"" to

If he wants charity he can ask places that don't employ both of you."
48,[deleted]
49,"&gt;&gt;I've tried telling him flat out what my feelings are, he says i am taking family for granted and that a lot of people would love to have such a large family and for them to reach out.

""Yes, bf, but that is not me, and I'm not going to discuss this with you any longer.""

Your instincts are right on here, and I hope you don't let him talk you out of it. Also, you can remind your bf that you are separate people, and that, just because he holds a value, doesn't mean you have to play that value out to your own detriment."
50,"Sounds like you want someone a little older and more mature. There’s nothing wrong with that, but remember to let this guy down easy, because he sounds like the type who takes breakups really hard. "
51,"Honestly, I would see if your boyfriend is willing to do a sit down with his mom so he can tell her that he told you. Then, you can tell the mom what you've told us about how you feel loved and welcomed over there and that these accusations have caused you an incredible amount of distress. Get it all out in the open. "
52,"I mean, from the story you told, it’s a wonder you even made it out there. Justified in leaving? Fuck yeah you were. "
53,"So, how about you pay proportionate to your incomes?

When he was making 0, he paid 0, you paid 100

Now he's making 80, and you're making 20, he pays 80 and you pay 20.

If he says no, ask why he's not willing to support you when you supported him. 

And then if he insists on paying 50/50, keep your 50 for yourself and dump that freeloader before he takes more from you. 

2 and a half years of paying for his shit was about 2 years too long. 

"
54,"&gt; I told him again that nobody else knew about that place, and I wanted to keep it that way.

If this is really what you said, I don't think it's very clear that you meant, ""Do not tell your friends hundreds of miles away that this place exists."" It sounds more like, ""I don't want anyone else coming here."""
55,"Break up. Go to planned parenthood and terminate the pregnancy.

You are not overreacting. Cut that friend out too, she sounds like a dip.

If you are in the US, go to your local planned parenthood, tell them you want to terminate your pregnancy, and apply to any abortion funds they know about. Also google ""abortion fund [your state]"" and see what comes up. Do it on your phone with your browser on privacy mode so your phone won't store the history. You can do this. "
56,"When he tries to ""take back"" the breakup (and he will): Don't.

He is manipulative, selfish and abusive. You deserve better. "
57,Sexual incompatibility is more than just an awkward first time. You should talk to him to make sure he agrees with that and understands there will a learning curve for both of you. 
58,So you got married when you were 17 and he was 21? How long had you two dated before getting married?
59,It's only been a few months. He sounds like a train wreck. Just bounce.
60,"Addiction is terrible for the user, and the family. Props to you for continuing to believe in your brother + support him. I hope he continues to make the right choices."
61,"There are some significant red flags here.

Him fasley claiming you never told him is a red flag. That he is so strongly insisting that it puts you in the wrong, so much so that it justifies an immediate breakup, without considering he might have misunderstod or have his own responsibility to stay updated on an issue that is apperently so important to him shows it is more conserned with claiming to be in the right than to find solutions. Also, the gaslighting.

His statement that he’s ”not going to bother with Thanksgiving and just stay depressed at home” is extreme guilting. He is essentially threatening you with him sabotaging his own mental health. That would mean that unless you do what he wants he will hurt himself. (Threatening selfharm or suicide is considered a form of abuse.) He tries to claim that his happiness is your responisibility, when actually we are ultimatly the ones responsible for our own mental health.

He breaks up you via text after 3,5 years. Just like you wrote that’s disrespectful. Unless there are risks involved or a LDR, then you break up in person. It’s basic decency, respect and care.

When you are upset, he tries to make you out as the bad guy. His statement that he thought you would be better than that is extremly manipulative and condesending. It again shows how he prioritieses claiming to be in the right and demanding you cater to his feelings. It defenitly seems to be a pattern for him.

Those are a lot of red fmags packed into one breakup. How incredible bad he’s handeling you going through with something he prefered you didn’t is a valid reason to stay broken up.

Don’t stay in contact with your ex. Because he is so manipulative and devalues your feelings so much it wouldn’t be healty for you. Even if he tries to guilty you for not giving him what he needs in the breakup or claiming it makes you a bad person for cutting contact, stand up for what is best for you. He can’t give you closure so it won’t give you anything anyway. Also, you cutting contact would make you feel somewhat in control again, which after being unexpectedly dumped via text is something you might feel like you’re missing.

Do all the breakup things people like to do after a breakup to help then process and move on. Keep busy. Do fun activities. Reconnect with supportive people in your life. Focus on yourself. Be a little self indulgent.

If you get tempted to get back in contact with your ex, then remember how he dumped you for deciding to go to a family funeral and spend ten days with family. Who is so neglectful of their partners feelings that them wanting to be a part of their family is considered selfish? His reaction was so not normal. Also, he dumped you via text. Never forget the disrespect of that. Someone who wants a continued good relationship (as exes, friends, or trying again) don’t do something so damaging. So he destroyed your chances of being able to stay amicable, and you just have to remember that moving foreward."
62,"Your boss is on your side, and has tried to shut that kind of talk down at a company meeting. Everyone knows that. It's time to have a meeting with the two of you where you show them evidence that it is still going on. Obviously your workmates have already cast you aside, so try not to stress about their reaction. They have made the choice to do this and the boss will need to deal with it. Be prepared to be ostracized by the worst of your coworkers. It doesn't sound like a great loss though."
63,Adding to other comments I wonder if he took anything else that you’re not aware of? Check if you’re missing stuff
64,"I’m really surprised your BF hasn’t heard of this before. It happens all the time with people who come into money, in whatever form. If they wanted to reach out, they would have before, and not everyone is super close with everyone in their extended family. Just because other people would like to be doesn’t mean you have to be, and while I do think it would be fine to talk to some of them “just to talk” (only if you’re up for it), if only to know for sure what their motives are, I do think you would be naive to think that none of them are reaching out for money."

Show each other through acts of love rather than feelings of anxiety.  Share secrets, get comfortable with each other 😊 just an idea"
69,"Your best bet is to call Planned Parenthood. They can tell you about the legal situation, whether the girl need parental consent or not, and what the sliding scale/charity/low-income options might be.

How would he, let alone his girlfriend, explain why they are staying with you for several days if he only comes to visit you behind your parents’ back? "
70,"I understand the position you were in 4y ago and why you decided to forgive him. However, a big part of gaining someone's trust back is being truthful and honest. Your husband is neither. He technically is stealing money from your marital assets to support his child and is now putting you in the impossible position of choosing between your family and his other kid. What else is he hiding? What else will he hide in the future? You will be better off divorcing him and him paying child support to you. He can take care of his son by himself. "
71,"I went on a date with a guy like this once, and I HATED it!! Ugh, still gives me the willies. Last I knew, He was with a girl that LOvES that mush, and thinks it is SO romantic. There’s nothing wrong with either of you, you’re just not compatible "
72,"&gt; He says all I did was just put on clothes and call it good. 

What the fuck did he do to get ready? Rip out his leg hair? Spend 45 minutes in front of the mirror jabbing eyeliner into sclera? Spend hundreds of dollars and dozens of hours on hair and eyelash extensions and microblading? 

Dump the loser. What a piece of flaming garbage."
73,"1. Stop giving him BJ’s if if makes you feel bad, never participate in any sexual activity that makes you feel bad.
2. Give him 30 days to move out. Help him look on websites for people looking for roommates. Be supportive but don’t take this all on yourself. 
3. Tell him you won’t be paying to subsidize his life anymore. Tell him he’s your friend and you have love for him, but you simply cannot continue to pay for his entire life and he needs to get a job like any other adult. Or he can ask his momma. Not your concern. 

Good luck! Once he’s out the door go date women your age. "

77,"Leave him. He needs motivation to improve his life, but right now he has a girlfriend, he has parents who are giving him money. He has no reason to improve.

79,"Actually don’t block him, just set his ring tone to silent. You want to be able to monitor if he escalates and you also want to document his behavior in case you have to go to the cops. "
80,"Your response is backwards.  His behavior when things are at their worst is exactly what we are looking at when choosing a lifetime partner. He has shown you that in time of stress and hardship, his focus is petty and mean.   ~~Here~~ These moments are why we don’t get married or even cohabitation for a few years so we learn who people are.  You got a lesson today. 

Listen to what he is telling you, it will serve you well.  "
81,Of course your boyfriend is in the wrong. Everything he did was wrong. Especially the ticket thing.

84,"&gt; Do I really need to have friends? I don't feel lonely now that I have a wife and kids, they easily fill up all the human interaction that I need.

Here’s the problem with this - someday your kids will be grown. Someday you may outlive your wife. What happens then? 

This is a really common issue for men especially. They depend on their wives and kids for all of their emotional intimacy and neglect to nurture social lives outside their immediate families. And then if their spouse dies or their marriage falls apart and their kids inevitably grow up and leave, they’re left lonely and lost with no one to turn to for companionship. 

This may be what your wife fears. "
85,"You have a daughter who is going to see that this is how men should/do treat women...like doormats.

86,"The problem I see is that your relationship revolves around eating and food. She has a strong emotional connection to eating and so equates you not indulging with her as a rebuff to herself. Did you guys bond alot through eating? That may be the problem there.

87,"You don't make him stop.  You leave him.  Like, immediately."
88,"I would consider filing a police report so that everything is on record in case his behavior continues. The fact that he showed no remorse with his overall demeanor change, makes me concerned that he could be a very scary person in the future if cornered or truly grasps that you are gone. This was a multi-year act of deception, these are not the actions of an entirely sane or morally upright person. 

At the very least, please make sure some close people are aware of the extent of his deceptions. Keep your proof backed up online, on a USB stick, on paper. Cover yourself in all areas. 

I would also do a complete wipe of your laptop after saving necessary stuff. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has some keylogger program on your computer, which tracks every key you press. 

At the very least, I would go through all of your electronics with someone who is savvy to tech spying. I would also set up 2-factor Authentication wherever it’s available. 

I would consider talking with a therapist if you are starting to question or doubt yourself on how this could have happened. 

I wish you the best in this upcoming transition. Please protect yourself and be very safe. I think you handled this in the perfect way, and it sounds like you’ve got a great head on your shoulders. Be prepared for full repentance and begging to be incoming. Stay strong. 

You’ve got this!!!"
89,"IDK, I love my husband, but I don’t really see the point in marriage. We lived together, our lives were intertwined, our finances were intertwined, and I certainly didn’t care if we got married or not. 

But we both wanted kids, and being married comes with legal protections that we felt were important if we had dependents. So we got married.

I feel like people are interpreting this as, ‘I’m only *with you* for the children’. But that’s not what she said. She said she loves you, but we’re it not for kids, she wouldn’t care about the institution of marriage. I don’t really think that’s weird or unusual. "

92,"Divorce your husband. He doubled down on his infidelity with another series of extended lies and financial infidelity. 

Your son and your daughter absolutely *should* have strained relationships with their father at this point. He's a lying asshole you ruined your family not once but twice.

If you stay, you teach your children to let their future romantic partners lie and cheat and to just accept that as normal. If you want your kids to grow up properly, you need to be teaching them that lies and cheating aren't okay, and that they should have courage and self-love to walk away from those situations.

You need to model positive self-love in their lives. And that means finding a way to love yourself enough to cut this asshole out of your life.

You have *nothing* to be ashamed of. You have been more tolerant and forgiving than most. But this needs to end now."
93,"I would break up with her. This is a fundamental incompatibility that can't be overcome and will lead to resentment. Also, I would be pretty annoyed if I were you. You were lied to and led on for over a year with a promise your partner never had any intention of keeping."
94,You can ask Josh and Cheyenne what their intentions are but neither of them are ever going to answer you truthfully.  At the end of the day actions speak louder than words and his actions speak volumes about how he actually feels toward this girl.

98,"Your boyfriend is wrong here. If your family really wanted to get to know you and form friendships or relationships, they'd have done it long before you came into money, not right after. The timing is way too suspicious for their contact with you to be genuine. 

One way to be sure, though, is to tell every one of them that the money is gone, that you used it to help your immediate family, and that there's nothing left. If they stop trying to contact you, you'll know for sure they just wanted your money. "
99,"I don't blame you one bit for being uncomfortable with that arrangement.

It's not all that odd that she's co-sleeping with her 4 year old... Both of my children insisted on sleeping in my bed around that age, and it was easier to just let them do it. So, I can understand that.

What I can't understand, as a mother myself, is inviting a strange man (yes, strange, because 8 months really isn't that long) to share a bed with my child.

If I were you, I'd tell her in no uncertain terms that you are not comfortable sharing a bed with her and her daughter, and as long as that is the sleeping arrangement, you will be spending the night in your own bed. She'll either start the process of getting her daughter in to her own bed, or she won't. If she doesn't, maybe it's time for a new relationship. Although, maybe I'm just overly paranoid, but I'm not sure I'd want to be in a relationship with someone who puts their child in that position (sharing a bed with a man she barely knows) to begin with.

Also, just something to think about, in this day and age all it would take is for that child to tell someone that mommy's boyfriend sleeps with her at night (as innocent as it may be) and you'd have your world turned upside down. "
100,"Congrats. You found your incompatibility BEFORE you got married and had kids. He's told you who he is, and what he expects you to do, and that he knows it's selfish but puts it before your happiness.

Luckily, the whole point of dating is to weed out people who don't fit well with you. If he won't budge, then the absolute best thing you can do for yourself is break up with him. Your compatible partner is out there, unfortunately it's not this guy. You should not stay when your fundamental beliefs are compromised for another person's, because that's not actually a compromise. That's identity annihilation.

Good news! You've been given the experience and the opportunity to work out your own best path. So get out there and find your best match."

105,"So I snooped a bit and saw your comment on the other post where you describe your parenting routine. Combining what you said there and what you've said here, it seems your wife gets up early to do morning routine, has a full day's work then comes home to cook dinner. After dinner she cleans up whilst you play with the kids. She then does bedtime routine.

Yeah, she's knackered."
106,"I think you should talk to your son, since he is the one that asked you, and tell him that while you are proud of your service and being a veteran, it isn't an experience you want to share with everyone.

Then tell your husband that guilt tripping you isn't helping and you won't be bullied in to doing something you don't want to. That you are there for your child in many ways and your service isn't a fun story that you share like candy at Halloween. It is personal and the issue is no longer up for discussion.

It is totally okay to not go and you aren't harming your son by not doing everything he asks you."

109,"Just to caution you, this mindset is incredibly hard to get over. The first thing you need to assess is whether or not she actually wants to view sex differently. If she does, then there's room to grow, if it's just you trying to pull her into a sex positive mindset that won't work out in the long-run, eventually she'll regress back to that mindset and you could find yourself locked into a deadbedroom. Be careful. "
110,"You should block him in all ways and essentially act like you don't know him.

He sounds unstable. I encourage you to continue going to the gym but keep your wits about you, make sure there are people nearby, etc. "

112,"&gt; ""I don't care that she looks bad or has a weird face, I still love her a lot, and I don't like you saying that I should date other people"". But... he still basically said, multiple times, that I look bad.

I don't know if it's fair to assume this represents your boyfriend's feelings about your looks. To me this sounds like him parroting his friend's words back to him, like, ""I'm restating your exact position and shooting it down to make it clear how much I don't care about your opinion."""
113,"""I know you have problems saying the words 'I love you' and I don't want to pressure you. That being said, hearing those words is very, very important to me.

117,"Honestly I would take a Saturday and go get lunch then drive her over to urgent care and just say, ""We're doing this."" Maybe she's scared to go alone or is aftaid it may be more serious.

Obviously you can't literally force her and she can always refuse to go in but sometimes people make up their mind easier when the situation is unavoidable -- like we are at urgent care and we're walking in and having someone look at this -- that's what's happening. 

If she refuses then I'd tell her you can't see her again until she goes to a doctor. Now that her feet are peeling she could easily get a staff infection or worse -- and that shit spreads.

124,Why is your uncle telling you about his sex life?? Yikes! Does he like getting a rise out of people? How inappropriate. I'd run in the opposite direction if any aunt or uncle (particularly one 20+ years older) started talking to me about their sex life. Maybe suggest he get checked out by a doctor if this is a recent change in behavior. How strange and you have every reason to back off.
125,"Deep breath.  It's okay to take as long to process this as necessary.

My first thought is that you should protect yourself legally/financially:  If your place is in your name only, give him notice to vacate immediately.  If you have any joint accounts, withdraw the money and close the accounts.  If he's on your accounts (has a credit card on your account, has a phone on your account, etc...) call and cancel those immediately.  Stop payments on any bills you're paying in his name (credit cards, car debt, car insurance). Change all of your passwords to entirely different ones.  Cut off the flow of money entirely.

Understand that ""securing an investor"", being ""on the verge of success"" and actually having a business that is PROFITABLE aren't the same thing.  There's still a very good chance that this business will fail, or at least, not provide enough income to support himself.  But whether or not he becomes financially successful, he's still a louse.

So, once you've got him entirely off your payroll, you're going to have some time and money.  (I say ""time"" because you've probably been taking care of him in more ways than just by paying the bills.)  You could either crawl into a hole and mope or you could use that time and money to live a life worth living.  My guess is there's a list of things you've been waiting to do (travel, career, health, family?).  It's time for you to do them.

You need to go live an amazing life, without this mooching schmuck.  And if he comes sniffing back around (after the 23 year-old realizes he has no money and tosses him out), you need to tell him to get lost.  

Understand that while there's a chance that you may have missed out on the ""payoff"" of being with him (when his company goes IPO and he's a billionaire), there's a far higher likelihood that he'll end up getting his ass handed to him by karma.  You can't see it, right now, but you've dodged a bullet.  "
126,"If I were you I'd try to understand her stance. She's really just looking for the necklace and it seems very valuable to her. So when that happens, everyone's a suspect. I would try to not let it bother me too much. Just try to understand her, she's not saying you did take it, but she's so desperate to find it that anyone is suspect. Good luck"
127,&gt; I was never sure about being a father because I don't know if I will be good with a son.
128,Just be the father you always wish you had growing up. Fuck the macho shit. We don't need more aggressive assholes in this world. You'll make a great father.
129,"Not okay at all. She is being totally inappropriate with him, and not only does he fail to shut her down but he tells her extremely private information that you’re not telling your own family yet?

Yes, this will require you to confront him. Screenshot the texts first, explain how you went down that rabbit hole and ask him why she is talking about them having a relationship, (even hypothetically), why he didn’t dissuade her and why he told her that you were pregnant. "
130,"It’s not the entire topic of the book, but _The Gift of Fear_ covers a lot of material about how we react in social situations with an obligation to reciprocate if someone’s kind to us, and it can feel very natural then if they _ask_ for something in return, like a phone number. It almost feels impolite to say no. (The book covers a lot of other really good stuff, but I’ve found this section to be by far the most frequently applicable one in everyday life.)

I’m not suggesting that this man orchestrated this, or manipulated you, or anything nefarious like that. The reason the behavior pattern is addressed in the book, however, is because until it’s brought to our attention, we don’t notice that “stranger being unexpectedly kind &gt; stranger asks for something &gt; saying yes out of obligation and politeness” is a pattern that is the path of least resistance to somewhere you don’t always actually want or intend to go. This is how we end up in unexpected babysitting situations or unfortunate carpooling arrangements. It’s in the book because manipulative people _do_ make use of it, and it’s good to be able to notice the signs and have ideas for how to break the pattern before you end up saying ‘how did I get here?!’ just like you did in this instance!"
131,"&gt; but I had to recognize my choices were unusual.

Lol, that is something only a person who has never struggled financially would say. What a place of privilege he comes from.

This does seem like a potential huge incompatibility and the fact that he tries to control what you say to other people is hugely concerning.

I would suggest that when you're out you call him out for trying to derail the conversation away from your story. And in private, you let him know that you're not going to edit who you are. That you are real and authentic and aren't image-obsessed and if he can't handle that, he knows where the door is."

133,"Dating etiquette in the USA (I don’t know where you are) includes a few options of how to pay:
* Man pays for everything (old fashioned and less common)
* Whoever did the inviting pays
* Split the bill in the moment - either each paying for their own food, each paying half, or each paying proportional to incomes
* Alternate who pays - without keeping rigorous track of how much is “owed”

There is no etiquette option of “woman offers to split, man says no, man later makes her pay.” He’s being inconsistent and unreliable at best. Any other red flags, money or otherwise, going on? "

140," &gt;I told him afterwards to please try to include me in big decisions like this and he said he would, but I still feel hurt. Idk, am I just being a drama queen? It could just be that it didn't cross his mind to discuss it with me. He is very absent-minded and I usually have to remind him about everything - from his mom's birthday and when his bills are due, to appointments &amp; even bringing his clearance badge to work.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like any of this. You are about to be a married woman, time to stop acting like a timid little girl. Sorry to be blunt but I was like you back when I was engaged (I was 25) and let a bunch of things go for too long before I found the self-confidence and security to speak up. Your relationship can withstand you being genuine about what is okay with you and what is not. If it can't, then this is not the right relationship for you and it's better to figure that out now than 10 or 20 years down the line. 

Don't ask him to ""please try to include you in big decisions"", tell him that big decisions must be agreed on by both partners in the relationship and either party doing otherwise is unacceptable. Talk to him about what qualifies as a ""big decision"". Don't cast yourself in the role of his social secretary and remind him about his mom's birthday. I used to do that, until I realized that I was stressing myself to death thinking up a million different Christmas presents for his whole family AND mine. Guess who buys presents for his own family now, or has to deal with last-minute errands when he forgets? Has your fiance ever opened the calendar on his phone? It's amazing! Will even email him every day for a week leading up to an event and notify him an hour before his appointment with directions. If he forgets his security badge every day for a week, do you think maybe the next week he'll start to remember it? 

I don't mean to be overly harsh because some people really are just absent-minded and a good partner will help them out, but also some people are just really lazy and will gladly defer that mental energy to their partner. Please spend some time really thinking about what kind of slack you are willing to pick up for him, and remember that right now you are setting a precedent for how your life together will be."

149,"His story doesn't make sense. He took a credit card out of his wallet, put it in his pocket and then left his wallet in the car? And why would he say that he wouldn't have money for a few weeks? When I lost my wallet at least three of my credit cards offered to overnight me a new card for free. Even if he had to wait it shouldn't take more than three to five business days. I'm wondering if he lives way beyond his means and that's why he was hoping you would give him money."

164,"I worked in a big corporate office for a famously shitty bank and the culture was to always CC your and/or their boss whenever you are having troubles like this or if you are even just talking to someone outside of your team. You don't really care how ""genuine"" your response is, you just want to get your work done with minimal drama, and the best way to do that is to whip people by letting them see that their boss is looking.

So, /u/nahnahyeahyeahclean the best way for you to handle this is, tell your boss that your teammates are refusing to work with you and being petty and they said it's because they are jealous of your work schedule. And tell him that you're going to CC him in some of those work related communications with them to get them to actually respond in a timely manner. And then you actually do it.

Your concern shouldn't be ""will they think I'm a snitch,"" it's ""how can I continue to do my work in an effective way?"" They are the unprofessional ones here, not you"
165,"I mean you had to file for bankruptcy. I don't blame your husband for feeling things are dire. I grew up real-poor, like you, but I can certainly understand that people who weren't raised with that background would think things are desperate long before the power is being shut off and there's only half a bag of flour left in the pantry. 

&gt; How do I make him see that he has NO IDEA what poverty is, to recognize how fortunate we are, and to stop running his mouth about our personal lives to MY coworkers?

I don't think that's the way to go. This isn't about the facts of poverty, it's about feelings, and he's clearly feeling very badly about your financial status. If you can find someone to help you on a sliding scale, you should seek about marriage counseling. This is exactly the sort of issue counseling is great at addressing.

OTOH I think it's appropriate for you to ask him to stop talking about your financials at work. If he's feeling desperate, he can ask for help from various charitable organizations that you *don't* work for. You deserve privacy. "
166,"This is tough; there are a lot of valid reasons that someone struggles to say ""I love you"" ranging from completely innocent to terrible. You might get a lot of speculation here, but ultimately no one is going to be able to tell you why he struggles with it.

On the innocent end of the spectrum: Those words are among the most emotionally vulnerable words that a person can utter. He may believe that by saying them, he's opening himself up to being hurt in the future.

On the not-great end of the spectrum: He may have hangups with his past relationships where he isn't fully ready to admit that he loves someone else.

The fact that he is so loving and affectionate toward you is a very good sign though. Actions often tell you a lot more about people's feelings than their words."

Ducking doesn't seem to be sending the right message so I honestly recommend saying that you don't want to be texted any longer because he is making you feel uncomfortable, and if this behavior continues that you will block him and bring this ridiculously unprofessional behavior to light. He has a wife, he should not be buying expensive gifts for female co-workers. And that comment about how that bracelet would have looked on you was incredibly fetishizing you. Not okay.

We really just want to do a guy’s thing, and I hope you understand and are cool with that. Obviously, I’d love to share an experience like this with you sometime too, but this has been a big deal to us for a long time,” I might be more understanding. I would still probably be hurt, though, that he wanted to take an amazing adventure like that without me, especially if he planned and arranged everything without even talking to me first. "

IMO this is tedious and I have no patience for people like this, though I don't exactly have a ton of friends so maybe take my advice with a grain of salt. 

I do think her feelings are not your problem. If she's going to be depressed it's going to be because of her own bad behavior. Hitting on a married man is really deplorable and you're totally within your rights to tell her she shouldn't get drunk anymore if she can't keep from doing bullshit like that. Not just trying to get your brother to cheat, but lying about things you've said to manipulate the situation.

179,"Google ‘Walkaway Wife Syndrome’, as that’s basically what this is. 

To grossly oversimplify, it’s when you ignore the wants and needs of your partner despite their repeated attempts to talk to you about it, so instead of continuing to try to fix the relationship the partner checks out and starts planning their departure. 

And when the time comes to leave, all of a sudden the neglectful party is rushing like mad trying to fix things because now he realizes that he has something to lose, but it’s often too little too late. This experience usually makes them better second husbands, or in your case, better next boyfriends.

There is a chance your girlfriend hasn’t checked out completely yet, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. Your rushing around to fix things is likely just pissing her off more, because it shows that you *know* how to be a good boyfriend and *could* have been doing it this whole time, when it mattered to her, but chose to wait until you yourself had something to lose, i.e. you’re doing this for yourself, not her.

Good luck!"

Second, Pap smears do not screen for wart-causing strains of HPV. They screen for the (non-wart causing) strains that can cause cancer. They are different, so it might be a good idea to mention to your doctor that your sex-partner had genital warts. 

Third, depending on how long you’ve been together, you might want to think about where he really got the warts from. Incubation time is 2 weeks to 8 months, with the majority of outbreaks happening 2-3 months after infection."

You're in the prime of your life. How many years of your life are you going to waste on a woman like this? I understand that you love her, and you want the best for her, but aren't you smart enough to realize that you deserve better? There are amazing, loyal, and strong women in the world that will make life interesting and fun. There are women out there that will love you to bits and when you look at them, all you'll feel is warmth and safety and pride.  

Don't you want that?  

Why are you settling for someone like her? "
186,"Here is my take on all this, the campsite was in many ways your safe haven from your borderline (?) abusive childhood. Its is not just something you did, visited or built it is a very special place for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I think in your mind showing him this place was a huge amount of trust, opening up your safe haven to someone you love. But i also get the feeling that you don't really want to admit to him exactly how important it was, and WHY it was important to you, so you downplayed it to him. Expecting him to ""get it"" while not actually having to open up that can of pain inside you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now either he is an asshole who just dont care about you, or he did not get it at all. And its kinda hard to blame him, from your story he might think this was something you did just for the fun of it, not in order to escape from something. And when you paint it like that... ""Dont tell anyone about this place"" sounds a lot more like ""dont tell anyone who can come here exactly where this place is"", meaning in this case your family.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise it seems he was bragging to his friends about all this and being super impressed, again it seems you never actually told him WHY you did all this or WHY it was important for you it was being kept secret. As much as it would help things, we can not read other peoples hearts we can only listen to their words (and once in a blue moon we figure out something on our own).

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion is that you start the discussion over. Tell him about your childhood. Tell him about why you resorted to camping alone. Its okay to be ashamed of things, or embarrassed, if he cares about you it wont matter. Most people have things in their past they would rather not talk about, but the only way for your partner to know this and know how to behave in relation to this is by opening up about it."
187,"What the actual fuck?  He sounds super narcissistic. I’ve been with somebody who treats me exactly like this. It’s absolutely awful and the mind games are unbelievable. I would just keep it the way it was just to piss him off since he wants to act like a jerk. I had also put all of his friends and family on restricted too, since someone wants to blab their big mounds about you obviously. He is very obviously upset and degrading you which is not acceptable but you handled it well. Good job!"
188,"Please talk to your parents about how scared you are. You’re fifteen, it’s okay to be scared. Your folks are probably a bit scared too right now, and if you just avoid it without explanation they’ll assume you aren’t taking your health seriously. They’ll understand that you’re afraid and need more support right now."

You shouldn’t be shamed for showing your natural face, that’s who you are!

193,"&gt; How do i bring this up to him without starting a argument??? 

I'd worry less about the argument and more about the very real situation you're in. If he's reasonable you should present this exactly how you did here. You carried him for 2 years now he needs to step up and put in more during this (hopefully short) period of your money troubles. "
194,"I think the first thing you should do is:

One night, right in the middle of dinner, say “so I got a bad feeling and I read your flirty texts with the realtor. Can you explain?” Then just sit there. She will go through a lot of emotions before she starts speaking with remorse and honesty, but just sit and be patient. 

Then after this conversation (which needs to happen), you ask her to go to marriage counseling. "
195,"I always felt like it's not a parents job to make life harder on your child. You don't have to be buddy buddy with this guy, but being civil while he's in your daughter's life is really in everyone's best interest. You need to respect your daughter's choices and desires.

Your sister had experienced a big loss and some chaos because of that before you existed, it could be that this was her coping strategy and now is how she approaches everything.

OP, it doesn't sound like you're ready to eat food with your family. Especially for a holiday with so much food pressure. It would be better if you could move it to a moment with less stress. But if you can't: make sure you have meals of your own that are easily prepared and only eat a little during the dinner. Prepare for a binge, then you can control how many calories you'll end up consuming so you don't add to your stress if you go over. If they ask, you can say your system is upset cos of the jetlag. 

Don't present this issue with your sister as something for her kids. Present it as: this is what happened to me. 

Have you ever had a diagnosis for this eating problem? Maybe you should get some professional help first, before you confront your sister. "

Funny because someone had to teach them what they know now but ok. The thing about this is you never want to feel shameful about the career you chose. This is something you should be proud about. This is something you want to do and you should be living for yourself, not for your family. What they think and believe shouldn't matter. You would think they would support you but all this is doing is showing you what kind of people they are. "
202,"You tried to talk to them and that didn't work. As much as you don't want to talk to your boss about this, you need to (assuming your boss is also their boss).

203,"Be sure to keep any proof you have of him using, it may be helpful later on in custody matters. Start gathering all of your important documents, store them outside of your home with someone that you trust. If you can't get the originals, get copies or pictures. Take pictures of all of your valuable possessions, include serial numbers if appropriate. 

People react differently when you actually leave, he might be ok, but be prepared for him to react really poorly. Depending on your state, you may need to look into an emergency custody order if you don't feel that the children will be safe with him. Do you have any women's shelters in the area? They can be great for supportive resources in your situation. Good luck with everything, you are stronger than you realize and an amazing mom. "

I don’t think you’re a bad person for smoking, but I question her mothering if she is willing to move her kids into a (semi) smoking environment when she could move them to your mothers (which I am assuming is 100% smoke free). 

Edit: if she is on bed rest and can’t physically watch her kids or clean up all her mess you still need to come up with some kind of compromise to keep her accountable. Figure out the things she can safely do around the house and have her do those things in exchange for you doing the things she can’t do "

210,"His feelings of being worried or scared are valid. And so are your feelings of being humiliated at work. I agree with you - your work should absolutely NOT sponsor you for Christmas especially if you have the budget to travel. There are families out there that literally have ZERO dollars to have a meal or buy ANY gifts and it should be gifted to them or families who face having to choose gifts or paying a bill.  Sure - free gifts and a  meal are very nice things to have, but it's incredibly inappropriate to receive it before you go on vacation. Is it possible that you could work with a social worker or therapist to smooth out both of your feelings? I know it's not free - but - if he's projecting his fears hard enough for HR to notice he needs to have a safer and more constructive place to work through his complaints.  "

I don’t know... maybe I watch too many romantic comedies. But if you feel something is iffy, it probably is."
213,"I can't really figure out how the employers and HR are going ahead with sponsoring OP's family if they're not actually in financial trouble; I mean, they know how much OP and her husband both make.

That's not to say that there aren't circumstances that could make a reasonable income suddenly not enough (like medical emergencies), but I can't help but wonder if either OP's family really is pretty poorly off and her kids COULD benefit from some sponsoring of gifts at the holidays (it's one thing to agree your kids don't NEED presents. It's another to be 5 and have nothing to open when your friends are all talking about their presents).

Or, is there maybe something going on with the finances that OP isn't aware of? Like if her husband knows of an expense that's caused him a lot of anxiety that OP isn't aware of? Just trying to consider all the possibilities."
214,"Yeah, this isn't a fair distribution of resources. Can you two agree to a rule that, if he replaces a nice thing that you bought and he used, he he buys that exact thing? In this case, it doesn't really matter whether or not*he* cares about what he's consuming, but the fact that you do, and it's a courtesy of him to be aware of that, and also aware of the financial disparity? 

Or maybe you can work out a hoarding system. I don't see much wrong with that--my SO and I both have nice things we really like and want to have on hand, and have warned each other ""hands off that thing because I'm saving it for xyz.""

Or, maybe you can agree to split costs on nice consumables. You buy nice craft beer that he drinks? Instead of replacing it, he venmos you for 1/2 and you replace with something you like. Same with pizza, coffee, etc.

If you can't come to an agreement about this, your bf is comfortable taking advantage in this way."

\&gt; I asked who'd told him that, and he said that Will had told him I'd built some hut in the woods with downed trees, and I'd sleep there and play with fire and watch animals

Ok, we need some serious clarifications here. He told people you are a nature person. And come on, female Bear Gryllis? I'll put a ring on that in a heartbeat. (Although I definitely don't want to see her devour bugs during the honeymoon) That is an AMAZING compliment. 

That said, when you say ""don't tell anyone about the campsite"" that's a LOCATION, not this NATURE SIDE of you. So depending on what you told him, the story can totally change course. He probably never told anyone the exact location of your secret place.

Again, if you told him that this whole other identity is your biggest secret then he is an asshole for it. 

So, could it be that you are over-reacting?"

This says to me that he didn't really see his life with anyone, but her. So everyone else he dates is just holding her spot.

You need to let him know that you can't be in a relationship where you're the second choice. He needs to deal with the relationship with his ex without hurting you in the process. You need to be someone's first and only choice in a relationship. 

The big problem is he's not done with his ex, obviously he has feelings that he hasn't resolved. Unfortunately nothing you could've done would've changed how he feels. He needs to go work this out on his own, without hurting you in the process."

2. You might not think it's about the age gap, but it actually is. Please don't think I'm blaming you for any part of this, however, older women are less likely to put up with this bullshit he's putting you through. Mostly because as you date and as you grow and as you interact with various people romantically, you learn to recognize your own boundaries and how to stand up for yourself when your needs are not met. This man is aware that he can push your boundaries, the exact ones you've put up and explicitly stated to him, and face no consequences. This is why an age gap is always suspicious. There's an imbalance of experience and self-awareness. 



3. This drinking this is not good. 




4. Being entranced and being excited when you're vulnerable - another classic predatory behaviour. 







OP, even though the first couple months of this relationship may have been magical, that's clearly not the way it is now. There are plenty of people out there who can give you that blissful honeymoon-phase goodness forever and ever, it does exist, but you need to recognise that this man is not making you happy and will never make you happy again. "
231,"So maybe this guy is just immature and thinks he's being sweet and romantic, but honestly, guys who frame their romantic partners through this kind of elevated, worshipful lens creep me out a little, because it's like they don't see the women they're with as people, but rather as some kind of abstracted, idealistic muse. I've also seen guys like this flip out and lose their minds when their partners fall off this weird pedestal by being human, and it's very unsettling. There are a lot of flavors of men who don't see women as people, and the ""chivalrous romantic hero"" is just as bad as the rest.

That said, again, maybe this dude isn't that type, and is just trying to be charming and failing. But this would for sure be a red flag that would lead me to critically examine the rest of his behavior for other warning signs."
232,Exit line: you want me to be like Anna? Fine. I'm not going to date you.
233,""" Finally, he told me that because we were friends first, he's never really been able to view me sexually. This explains SO much. ""

Uhh, no it doesn't? My partner was my best friend for three years before we dated. A close friend two years before that. And the sex is the best I've had because we trust each other absolutely, and know how to communicate. I have absolutely no idea how being friends with someone first stops you finding them a sexual being - unless you don't find them attractive at all. In which case why did he ever date you? 

I mean, honestly, your husband has been a shitty friend to you, because he's lied by omission, lied through actions. Friends tell each other hard truths. Lies are for acquaintances and strangers. I mean - he's probably lying to himself: I'm not trying to say he's a terrible person. But friendship doesn't explain this. That's all."
234,"&gt;and to prevent myself looking like a psycho girlfriend I told him to go ahead

Uh oh, Cool Girl trap.

You would have been perfectly within your rights to say something like, ""I'd like to discuss this with you privately."" Or, ""I need a little while to think about this before I say anything.""

You can, and should, still talk to him and ask him to sit and listen while you say you're disappointed, you thought you and he would go together, you're confused as to why you weren't invited and you're hurt that this will be over Valentine's Day, which hold significance for you. "
235,"Does he really think he can get out of the parking ticket by just not taking it? They'll just send the parking ticket to his house (or the home of whoever owns the car) because they have that on record. Also, he doesn't seem to be the most moral person in the world. Is his lack of morals a dealbreaker for you? "
236,"Dude, you haven't even properly dated this woman and you're already thinking about marriage? You've made out a few times and now you're considering joining her cult-like religion? You are not thinking clearly at all."
237,"Straight to HR. 

&gt; but I feel like those lines get blurred whenever we’re all partying together.

There is never a circumstance where what he did would be OK or even in a grey area. Your boss texting you sexual things out of the blue is not OK no matter how much everyone's had to drink."
238,"Yeah. If she were 11 or something, obviously that would be more of a situation where it'd make sense to stay with her. But 16 year olds can certainly handle being left on a porch to wait for their parents."

240,"At least where I live, Sanitation workers have good salaries and benefits and absolutely kill it on overtime when it snows. They also have a great retirement package.

As long as they're cool you shouldn't create a problem that doesn't exist."

246,"He wanted to see how much you’d be willing to do to get him back. He probably thought you were the thirsty one chasing him. 


I’ve dealt with people like this before. 
Cut him the fuck out. He’s playing games. Remove him. "
247,"I'll let her know what happened. I feel guilty somehow, like it's my fault for letting this happen. I'm sure Sara thought we'd be a good pair. She wouldn't have known about the huge age difference and she never would have sent me on a date with a guy that she didn't think was a good person."
248,The food part in the beginning was bad enough. Move on. 
249,"So combined with your post from a few days ago, you have a wife who was raised in a conservative, ""drugs are bad"" home.  Yet you hid emerging drug usage from her, and when she confronted you about it, it sounds like you justified yourself. And then pretty much hounded her into using them, too. 

I would say she is most likely way the hell out of her comfort zone while doing the majority of the difficult parts of parenting, while you get to be ""Fun Dad.""  And she can't fully trust you either, considering she's still most likely dealing with the fallout of you hiding drug usage from her...but not too well, since she picked up on your reasons for going to the EDM concert that precipitated her waking you up in the middle of the night.

Your wife isn't just burned out on household duties.  She sounds like she's trying her hardest to accommodate you, because she may have come from a world where that is what a ""good"" wife does.  And yet, you're still here on /r/Relationships complaining that you don't have ""the best"" of her.  I think it's safe to say that she doesn't have the best of you, and she knows it.  And you need to concede that you are getting a lot more of her that is supportive and accommodating than she is getting from you. 

Your wife is not your manic pixie dream girl on the same spiritual journey with you.  She is a wife and mother trying to hold down a job and raise her kids while most likely struggling trying to maintain a marriage that she didn't sign up for.  Open your eyes, put down the Molly, and get into some couples' counseling to work this through.  If recreational drugs are that important to you, fine - I'm not judging.  But right now, if you think they are actually helping your wife's mind-set and approach to your marriage, you are not seeing things clearly. "
250,don't date someone who has to lie about themselves to get a date...
251,"Don't contact her family.

She gave you a clear signal not to contact her by blocking you. 

Her family is going through enough without having to deal with the ex-boyfriend that dumped her two weeks prior.

Sorry, dude. I know you feel bad but don't make it about you. That's not fair to her or her family."
252,"This. He is cheating again because he knows from past experience that if you do end up finding out you'll just forgive him anyway. He has no incentive to change. 

Please OP, don't let your daughter believe that this is normal. Imagine that your daughter was in your shoes and asking you for advice. What would you tell her if you saw her husband treating her this way? I know what I would tell my daughter...he's being secretive, he's cheated before and he is showing all the signs of cheating again. You deserve better.
"
253,Sucks. Sorry dude. You gotta do what you gotta do though. You're 30 and gotta pay the bills.
254,"It may be that there is a miscommunication here about what you both expect from a friendship.

Based purely on anecdote I think that many women are in more frequent contact with their female friends whereas men more often tend to follow the pattern you do. As a woman, I message my closest female friends most days or minimum several times a week. 

It may be that your friendship when you saw her as a romantic possibility fit her model of a friendship so obviously now you have dialled it back to your usual pattern of friendship she is upset. From her perspective maybe it feels like you were only spending time with her to get in her pants and now that option is off the table you have dropped her. 

Perhaps there is a way to meet her half way? I you care about her and would still like to be her friend then talk to her about this. 

A lot of the comments below this about you being an ""emotional tampon"" and the like may be from men who don't know very much about how women conduct close friendships. We lean on our friends heavily for emotional support whereas I think most men don't always have that. To many men, your partner is the person who you open up to emotionally so they get confused or angry when a woman they are romantically interested in but who has turned them down continues to treat them (in their eyes) like a romantic partner. She is not, she is treating you like she would one of her female friends. "
255,"The fact that he forgot your anniversary is less of a problem than the fact that he forgot, AND THEN WENT FOR A NAP WHILE YOU CRIED ALONE. If he had forgotten but was then genuinely remorseful and actively making plans to remedy the situation (setting alarms, putting it in his calendar, etc) it wouldn't be as bad. You should not have to be the one to do or suggest these things. Quite frankly, it seems like he does not give one single fuck about your feelings.

To talk to him about this, I suggest you say something along the lines of ""when you forget things like this, it makes me feel like you don't love me or care about me, because this is literally a day about celebrating our love for each other"" (Or however it makes you feel). Then see what he says. If he is full of sincere apologies, discuss together what can be done. If he is more like  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ then you need couples counselling or a divorce. "

258,"You're not legally married?

LEAVE."
259,"Tom is a dolt.

I'm going to venture to say there's a reason for it, though. Sounds like he's the golden child of his family. He's a 26 year old man that thinks rudeness is funny, that everyone should immediately jump on board with anything he does, that he doesn't need an ounce of tact or to play nice, that his opinions are always right and wanted, and that he should get what he wants when he wants it.

Your husband is blind to it because that's likely been his whole life growing up. Your husband likely has 26 years worth of ""Oh, that's just how baby brother is!!"" to fight against. It's going to take time and patience to turn away from that now.

(I could be wrong on all of that, it's making a pretty big leap, but the mom saying he's treated her poorly, too is kind of what makes me lean in that direction.)

It's infuriating, but it's not entirely your husband's fault. Like I said... I think Frank has many years of Tom acting like a dolt and it being swept under the rug by the whole family to go up against. I don't think this is an issue of Tom hating you, exactly. I think this is an issue of Tom... being Tom.

You're absolutely right to expect more from your husband, though. I would just throw a little more credit his way for finally confronting Tom at all. I bet that was a whole new experience for him. I may even let *some* things from the past slide - with the expectation that things in the future don't. Also with the expectation that Frank has Tom apologize directly to you - at least for the more glaringly horrendous stuff. (It's probably a little much to expect an apology for a name left off a card nearly 3 years ago, but an apology for general animosity and not trying to build a relationship even when you extended an olive branch... That's owed. To confront things in the moment as they come here on out, that's owed.)

Also, if you've been biting your tongue out of respect for your husband, but it's led you to the point you're considering leaving.... I suggest it's time to stop biting your tongue. 

That's a long way of saying you're right, but i do think you should give your husband a chance to get it right and be patient with him while he figures out what's right for probably the first time ever in his relationship with his brother. At least for now. (And that you should stand up for yourself, too.)"
260,"You can. That person is out there but he isn’t available to you because you’re in a relationship.  You’re going to have to be brave, take a chance and move on. While it is likely you can forgive the boyfriend for his feelings, you will never forget the way this moment makes you feel. That won’t fade or ever feel better, no matter what happens in the future.  

The good part, heartache fades and new people come into our lives. At some point in the near future, you will look back at this time as the moment life begins and you will be grateful to the boyfriend for having been honest.  "

262,"I agree with other's saying this sounds like PPD. I think the excessive phone usage could be a way she's trying to cope with the PPD. I've noticed that I'll get on my phone more when I'm feeling low, and I've also read about how it can give you little shots dopamine and be really addictive. Maybe if you approach your wife from a place of concern she'll be less defensive."
263,"Also, it can be hard for a wife to be the sole emotional connection you have. I say this, because this is my dad. My dad has never really had any friends, except for a couple who were long distance and who unfortunately have all died now. Now that he is retired, his only real relationship is with my mom and it can be exhausting for her (I live far away and am not close with him)."
264,"Fucked up and just immature on your brother in law’s part. As a mature and independent adult you’d just own up to it and apologize, and offer to take care of it. He’s definitely in the wrong. 

Buuuuuuut....

Your fiancé confided in you with the comfort of it staying between you. It’s totally understandable, especially if it’s such a small scratch, that she wouldn’t want to confront them. Now it puts her in a position where she feels like your family sees her as this petty lady making a big deal out of a faint scratch. It just put negative vibes in a situation that there didn’t need to be. If your fiancé doesn’t feel like she can trust you when she expresses this little discomfort about something, she’s definitely not going to feel confident telling you anything about your family that she doesn’t want getting out. 

Imo, go hand and feet and try to make it better with her. It’ll sort itself out with your brother in law, but she needs to feel confident that she can trust you to keep shit between you two if she so expresses. "

I would never consider purchasing property in such an area.  I don't care how long it's been since flooding occurred or what kind of mitigation measures may have been implemented.

Forget house B too, it really doesn't sound like anything but a safe alternative to A.   Keep looking for something that is actually attractive to both of you.

&gt;we then do run the risk of not finding anything as good in the timeframe we need.

What's the time pressure?"

Yeah....that doesn't sound good. "
272,"1. Sit down with hubby and work out a plan for dealing with her actions and behaviour that you can agree on.

2. Sit down all together and make the boundaries clear to her about what is acceptable behaviour. She is old enough to own her choices. She can choose to be part of your family and operate within its social fabric or not - that is her choice alone.

3. Therapy - this girl is definitely in survival mode and will have issues about how to get what she wants etc. She needs to learn how to be part of a loving family (if that is her choice). So be patient whilst she does this BUT if she does nothing to show an effort, have a joint plan with hubby about consequences and still to it.

Even natural parents who have raised their kids can  have the same challenges. The difference is they have had longer to form bonds and know the workings of that child. So be kind to yourselves during this time."
273,"I also am not a fan of ""and I can't invest all my spare time in someone if it's not going to go anywhere.""

276,"This all sounds very Victorian.

So, one, I think you should get your husband a mental health evaluation. These could be symptoms of emerging mental illness.  

But I also think your husband should find a new church for some spiritual guidance. I'm not religious at all, but your husband is, and it sounds like a lot of this is about his shifting relationship with religion, the afterlife, etc. A good pastor can help him work through his feelings about his first relationship and his relationship with God. "
277,"Have you asked him not to do those things? Because if his reaction is, ""Oops, I'm sorry, I didn't realise you didn't like it, I'll stop"", that's fine. If his reaction is ""what are you saying, I'm your boyfriend, that's my right"", then yeah, red flag."
278,Remind them that doctors and lawyers only exist because of teachers.
279,Red flag for sure in my opinion. I think it's weird that you'll be watching a movie and he'll be watching porn on his own and not doing stuff with you. I don't think watching porn is bad but he has weird timing with it. Talk to him about it and see what he says. You have valid reasons for bringing this up. 
280,Am I the only one who thinks this is a little silly? ... considering your parents are 40 and you’re 21? They would have conceived you at 18.
281,"Yikes. I can’t fathom why someone who claims they love you would talk to you and treat you the way she does. I think you deserve better. She sounds selfish, immature, and manipulative. If she’s causing this much pain in your life on a consistent basis what’s the point in staying with her? I know y’all have history and I’m sure you love her but I’m willing to bet if you moved on you’d thank yourself for it "
282,"I dated an objectively unattractive person once. I loved him so much he became attractive to me. I still see it when I look at him even though the relationship failed. But I still know he is unattractive on an awareness level, it just doesn't effect me personally as I see him differently. He's handsome and sexy and still got it. 

So objectively you know you aren't attractive, and that you have a weird face, and so does your bf, but he sees something else because he knows you. He sees a pretty girl he cares about. Doesn't mean he doesn't objectively know you may have a weird face. My ex has a fucked up face, straight tragic, but he was and is beautiful to me and lots of people who know him. It's like, proof that looks only matter so much for certain people and almost not at all for others.

I wouldn't say anything. I'd just try to rethink and reframe this. 

You know you're ugly. He knows you're ugly. But he thinks you're beautiful anyways. And that says a lot. And that's all that really matters. You didn't learn anything you didn't already know. You knew how you look to the outside world and he is the outside world but he doesn't care cuz that's not how he sees you anymore. Focus on that. Focus on how he sees you as a beautiful woman who he loves. Cause that's the truth. Don't poison yourself with thinking otherwise unless he treats you as anything but beautiful.

Stop with the texting. Stop with the ""good morning/good night"" texts. Use this break to decide what you really want. She should he doing the same. If you want to go back to a sexless relationship where she makes and breaks promises, okay. If she realizes she'll do anything to get you back, romcom-style, okay. If you meet someone else, okay.

290,"It’s not a religion you can fake by turning up for an hour on Sunday. They have meetings three times a week and preaching door to door on weekends. You’re not supposed to have “worldly” friends or really any interests outside the religion. 

Depending where you are in the food chain the judgement and interference can be insane. I’m talking two elders turning up on your doorstep to question why you haven’t been attending regularly or dressing you down for any perceived slight. 

My biggest beef with them though is that they are currently actively hiding evidence of child sex abuse and refuse to change their policy that two people must witness the abuse for them to act. 

I’d think real hard about this. It might not seem bad to begin with but what about ten years down the track when youre married with kids and still don’t believe and you break up over it. You’ll be shunned by everyone who’s still in, your kids will be told all sorts of things (my uncles kids were 4 and 5 and they were told dad had demons at his house so when they stayed they were hysterical.

She lied about this to you because she wanted you to herself. She denied you a father. That’s not what a loving parent does, regardless if they were cheated on and heartbroken. 

Google parent alienation when you have time and see if there are similarities with how your mother talks about your father. I think this will help you see that she most likely is the reason you don’t have a relationship with him.

The choice is yours, but he is not the enemy. That was proven with the court case. If she doesn’t respect your decision as an adult to have a relationship with your father than you need to realize the guilt, manipulation and control she has filled you with.

309,"My best friend was my maid of honor and she fucked my husband and had an emotional affair with him two months before our wedding. 

You are better off cutting both of them completely out of your life, because what she did was wrong. Even if you were broken up when it started, the right thing to do as your friend would have been to at least say, ""I'm so sorry, I know this is wrong, but I have feelings for DH."" And then you talk it out as friends. 

My true friends now have proven time and again what real love and friendship is. The fact that she stayed silent speaks volumes...she does not love you, she is not your friend. This is not friendship. Don't waste your time. 

I'm so so sorry you have to go through this...know how hard it is. "
310,"It sounds like your husband is legit scared about this financial situation you're in, and though you know it could be a lot worse, that doesn't mean his feelings of fear and sadness and pressure and stress and wanting and whatever he feels aren't valid feelings he's having. 


If you talk to him about his feelings and hear him out, maybe he will have more space to listen to you talk about your feelings of embarrassment, and surprise, and empathy for those in a worse spot. 


Then maybe you guys can be on the same team and work to meet those needs your feelings represent. Work together to come up with strategies to help each of you meet your needs. Like if he's worried about not providing the Christmas his kids want, you guys can strategize around making christmas awesome with activities and family traditions and homemade gifts. "
311,"I have screenshots of everything backed up to my Google drive.  He will not fight me on custody of the kids because he already knows I have proof and he doesn't want to get tested.  His job requires that he's drug free.  He uses that fake pee for that.  He knows I would request a hair sample and he still has pot in his system.  He isn't going to do anything that could bring out his drug use.

I plan to use this if I need to.  I'm trying to make this as simple for everyone as possible.  I can't afford a lawyer and he makes too much for me to get help.  When it comes time to leave, I'll tell him that if I have to get a lawyer, I will make sure he doesn't get visitation and will show the proof I have.

Thank you for your kind words.  He's trying to make me out to be a horrible mom for leaving him."
312,"He shouldn't be ""helping"" you. He fucking lives there. He should be doing chores. 

Show him this:

Husband, you're disgusting. Your wife would literally have an easier life *without you in it*. Who the fuck leaves cat vomit on the floor for more than 5 minutes? Disgusting, entitled, man-children, that's who. Fucking pull yourself together and *do your goddamn job of being an adult* and *clean your fucking house*. "

Get a dog instead.
"
315,"Hmm, well her stance years ago when we were getting to know each other was that she was afraid to get married because she didn't want to be controlled. She always wanted to be a SAHM. I'm not sure what her views on children out of wedlock are, but she's always stated that she would have had kids much earlier if it wasn't for not having the financial means for it. She wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, but never really enjoyed it. She wanted to get started making the family right away. 

"
316,"&gt;Later we are arguing in the car and he goes ""sorry but yes your natural hair DOES look lazy"" 

Your boyfriend is human garbage. "
317,"&gt;I told him again that nobody else knew about that place, and I wanted to keep it that way. (I didn't get into explaining why, but my main reason is that it had always been my private get away when I was going through difficult times, and needed peace. I wasn't embarrassed by it really, I just like the idea of having a refuge in nature.)

This is on you, not him. You showed him a location that's intimately tied to some traumatic shit you experienced in childhood, and you totally downplayed its significance to you. He then turned around and boasted to his friends that his girlfriend built an awesome campsite by herself as a kid, and they ribbed you good-naturedly about it.

From your title, I was expecting to read that he brought all his friends to the site and they trashed it or something. They don't even know where it is, just that it exists. So yes, I do think you're overreacting."
318,Lol. Your boyfriend is wrong about everything to do with this situation.
319,"I'm late to the party here but I'm a clinical microbiologist, and EFFING CHRIST this is not something to fuck around with! I get to see a lot of septic infections that started out as foot wounds, and although these are usually diabetic feet, your gf is at the same level of risk here. Take her to urgent care or the ER if you have to. Btw it definitely sounds like a fungal infection. I'm curious what the fungus turns out to be! I dont have much advice on getting her to go on her own. If it helps at all, tell her some microbiologist on reddit said that this will not go away on its own, and that leaving it to fester is highly dangerous. 
Edit: did some digging, Tricholosporum violaceum is specific to Costa Rica and causes basically the same symptoms as typical athletes foot. Needs prescription antifungal meds. She might remember seeing the mushrooms that caused it, they are beautiful bright purple mushrooms sometimes near oak trees. "
320,"OP do this! Or tell her you're going to dye your hair black and you absolutely *adore* henna hair colours. Because a combination of those makes it really really hard to change your hair colour back. You could even go a step further and photoshop your hair black (or any other colour you wouldn't want) and post it online. Or get a realistic wig/any black wig with bad lighting in the photo. Then after she does it, when she inevitably sees you, you could say ""That was for a costume/just an idea I had/I thought it looked so funny that I just had to post it, but I wouldn't actually do it!"". She can have fun trying to get that out of her hair and wrecking it in the process with bleach, especially if you decide to go blonde/pastel next."
321,"For the piano, ask them if you can get a keyboard with headphones. That way, you can still play without making any noise that might startle the baby. It's not ideal, but probably the closest to a compromise you can get right now.

This is a really, really tough situation, and I'm sorry. I can't tell you not to have feelings about the situation. I'm sure you *do* realize it's life or death for him, but that doesn't mean you aren't a person who has needs and feelings of your own that are also important.

I'm sure a large part of the reason nobody is allowed over is because your brother is immune compromised - any minor cold (and we are entering cold/flu season) could be fatal for him.  Sadly, it would be all too easy for you to pass something to your parents, and from them to the baby. Can you talk to your parents about options? Do you have other relatives or friends you could go stay with for a bit? Would that be less stressful for you to be in an environment where you could be a little more ""normal,"" and where they didn't have to worry that being with you would risk the baby's life? Again, not ideal, but maybe better for now.

When you can, try talking to your dad about this. I would suggest approaching it from the perspective of ""this is hard for everyone - can we make it easier?"" And if he can't hear you right now, then consider talking to your school counselor or another trusted adult."
322,"Also, mention that you've tried to address it with your coworkers, to no avail, and that coming to him is a last resort.

A private conversation with him is much more professional than letting it continue to build and having some kind of blow up (coming from you, or a coworker) happen publicly, in the office."
323,"Agreed. My ex-boyfriend stalked, abused and manipulated me for months, the only thing that stopped him was me going to the police. You should never trust someone who did that to you, better sooner than later, trust me."
324,"So, I had a boyfriend like this. I was the second person that he abused. There are 5 after me, and he told each one that the girls before him were the abusive ones, that he was bipolar but he just found out and would get treatment (he was ""diagnosed"" at least 3 times, and told whichever girlfriend he had at the time that it was the first time he had heard of it), He threw a microwave at his mother when he was 16, he's raped 5 of us, and he's smashed his current girlfriends head into a wall.

He's told every single one of us that he had changed. His current girlfriend has been warned, and at a custody hearing the judge even told her that he isn't allowed anywhere near her kids. Even after speaking to all 7 of us, and having her face smashed in, she won't leave. 

He's escalated his behavior since I was with him. We're all worried that he's going to kill the person he's with now.

You have been warned for a reason. LISTEN TO HER.She's doing this for your safety."
325,"Also, in real life most people dress nicely but don’t go all out with hair/makeup at a funeral. Even at a funeral for someone you weren’t close to you can end up crying and a load of mascara and black eyeliner running down your face isn’t great. It’s not the time to get crazy dolled up - this isn’t your show, ya know? I wouldn’t be surprised if she put on a lot of makeup and his family was offended that she didn’t seem to respect the atmosphere of mourning. 

It’s a really unattractive attitude to have that “you look lazy with natural hair” and “I don’t care if spending a bunch of time frying your hair damages it more. I wonder if he will still like her when she’s bald or when her hair is frizzy from the damage."
326,"&gt; OP needs to make it clear that even if 99% of people with a missing leg consider themselves disabled and want to go to therapy, David isn't one of them...and they need to respect him as a person.

Especially considering if he lost his leg when he was 10, I guarantee he already went through therapy and probably already has his own resources if he feels like he needs to go back."
327,"&gt;I'm sure Sara thought we'd be a good pair. 

He fooled both of you into thinking he was a normal guy. It's not your fault (nor Sara's) that he hid the weird, aggressive, and disrespectful side of himself."
328,"Maybe wait a few weeks, in that case.  She's clearly extremely upset and not acting ""rationally"" right now. That doesn't excuse her actions, but she's desperate and grasping at anything and everything. "
329,"This is very important, OP. Aside from what everybody has already writen, it sounds a lot like he's using the situation to charade a ""preventive break up"". Preventive break up is when you break up with someone with the intent of creating dependancy towards you so it will be easier to manipulate them in the future, asking them out again when they're at their lowest.

Listen, he will seem like he's sorry, he will seem very down, he will make a thousand promises about how he's going to be a better boyfriend. **DON'T LISTEN TO HIM**. I've seen it happen enough times to know it's all part (sometimes it's the first step) of the circle of abuse. 

Cut contact and feel lucky for the bullet you've dodged. I wish you the best, OP!!!!"
330,"Not until you said that... But he did take it pretty badly when I ended things despite everything he had given me...

That might not be it though, the texts used figures of speech I'd never heard from him. So I'm inclined to believe it actually was his wife"
331,"You handled it *perfectly*. Flawlessly! 10/10 adulting! 

She, on the other hand, clearly has some problems. I wouldn't pursue any further interactions with her if I were you."
332,"You aren't legally married. Just pack your shit and leave. ""Spiritual marriage"" doesn't mean crap in the eyes of the law"
333,"I would feel the same way, OP. That is NOT okay of him, in no way whatsoever. There is no way to twist that to be okay. Advice is one thing but photos? Absolutely too much. If he was having that much of a hard time with it he should have come to you. I would re analyze why you are in this relationship and see if you fee it truly needs to continue. You will likely never trust him and that will break you. "
334,It would make sense if he wasn't really into social media like that... But he definitely sounds like he's hiding your relationship... Sorry girl.  Cut your losses and good luck.
335,I would confront him.  It sounds like he is having an emotional affair and the other party would like to make it a physical one as well.

338,"OP, make sure you keep your savings in a place that HE CANNOT TOUCH. Always keep your cards on you. He's a drug addict. He will try to steal your savings, especially if it means keeping you where you are."
339,"&gt;He spent close to $1000 on a single concert ticket.

That's not ""trying"". Please really let this sink in - **THAT'S NOT TRYING.** ""Trying"" would be running it past you first. ""Trying"" would be at least not screwing over your other payments in the process. He doesn't give a shit. He really doesn't. You're exactly right - leave (or at least counselling, therapy for him, you being **mad as hell** and him losing all debit card rights, you locking down all finances, etc.) or else accept this is your life. Because again, he's not trying! This isn't an accident, it's not an oversight. Any functional adult with half a brain cell would KNOW this was a stupid idea and he just did it.

If you stay with him, a) you know you can't trust him, and b) you're going to have to treat him like a child. You'll have to control all finances and engineer your lives such that he's totally unable to spend anything north of about $20 without consulting you, **because you can't trust him.** As a wise green being once said: do or not do, there is no try.

346,"So first of all, no you aren't wrong to want to make sure the cats are well taken care of.  Your friend was doing a *deplorable* job of caring for these cats, they had fleas, they weren't fixed, they didn't have a good home environment and they weren't getting vet care.  

But second:

&gt; I offered to take her cats, and said I would like a 6 month ""trial period"" to make sure they would be well taken care of with my lifestyle, and would give them back if it didn't work out (and of course, I offered to keep them longer if she needed me to).

This sounds very clearly to me like your idea was that you wanted to adopt them but not fully commit to it until 6 months in.  It does NOT sound like you were offering to board her cats until she could take them back.

I would tell your friend that you went into this understanding that she was giving you the cats as long as you were okay with that 6 months in, and you are very very okay with that and intend to keep them.  And that you never intended to agree to take care of *her* cats for some arbitrarily long period of time.

If she sees it differently, fine.  I would tell her you consider the deal done.  "
347,"I would make a complaint to the gym itself. If you were at the gym first they should know he is making it a hostile environment for you and maybe others.

That said, I don't think there's much to be done here except to recognise that these are probably not people you want to be friends with, and get some counseling for the other stuff you've got going on."

If he insists that you go halfsies on EVERYTHING, then you need to insist that you do things that you can afford and you want to do.  He can't request specific activities and then have you pay more than your budget allows"

Definitely warping her thought patterns. "

359,"I completely agree. I can see how to someone who has experienced the power turned off, sleep for dinner kind of poverty, OP and her husband’s situation doesn’t seem to compare. 

However, as someone who has grown up probably more closely aligned with the husband’s experience, I can also see why he’s talking like this. If I had to file for bankruptcy, to me that would be an indication that my financial situation was in fact pretty dire. It would mean I’d racked up an amount of debt that I was unable to repay, and that’d be a sign that I had lost control over my finances. It would be very, very scary to me. I’d feel like I was on the edge of losing everything.

This isn’t the oppression Olympics, but OP should understand that her experience of poverty is not a benchmark. There are many types of poverty, including breadline and working poor. Splitting hairs over the definition of “poor” and how poor they may or may not be is not conducive to a healthy relationship, nor to getting back on their feet financially.

That said; I’d be mortified and furious if my partner was telling people at work about our finances. To add insult to injury, they work together, so she has to see these people who now think they’re on the bones of their ass not making ends meet.

Husband needs to shut his trap and kindly refuse the offer from HR. He needs to learn some grace and decorum. It’s absolutely fine to ask for help; but telling all and sundry at work that you’re poor and struggling is embarrassing and runs the risk of making them look like grifters - especially if they figure out that the situation is not as he has described it.

I recommend some financial counselling. It could be practical to help them get their finances under control; but more importantly, it can help OP and her husband to see eye-to-eye on the realities of their finances and stop disagreeing over what constitutes “poor”.

361,"Don't focus on him and what he's done, focus on your daughter and what she needs right now. If she has to think about mediating between her father and husband right now, she'll be even more stressed. Be polite, try to alleviate her stress and worry. You don't have to fluff his pillows or offer him the best cuts of meat, but don't instigate an argument or fight. Raising the tension won't help her or your relationship with her. This is her decision to make and she needs to know you don't plan to make it harder for her.

I can't believe he stayed with her after she drove off his first daughter. You should be really nice and grateful to your brother's fiancé. I get that having your family separate is hard but this woke mean that you don't get to see your dad or brother anymore and honestly your mom sounds like a really toxic influence right now.

But, I'm trying to build a trusting and honest relationship with your daughter and keeping this from her feels like a betrayal of the bond we share."" And see what mom says to that.

If this story is true as protrayed, if dad is getting caught getting a handjob in the back yard, something tells me that OP's GF might already know or have a good idea about this already.

369,"If anyone thinks that an expensive gift after some one makes a romantic advance is free with no strings attached, they are either naive and ignorant, or enjoying the attention.

I'm going to purposefully be charitable to your girlfriend because the only other option than naivety is to think that your girlfriend is malicious. And I like to rarely attribute to malice what's easily explained by ignorance/stupidity.  

In any case she hasn't handled the situation the right way, this understandable as it's an awkward position she's been put in but she still needs to do more:

1. She has to return the watch. Good on her for rejecting him, but she undermined her rejection by accepting it. ***In the context of his prior advances the watch comes with strings attached.*** It's a nonverbal message that he intends on continuing to pursue your girl, and by accepting it she unintentionally gave him the green light to continue that pursuit. if she's serious about her rejection, she can't keep the watch end of story. ***He's going to feel entitled to her attention because she kept the watch. Even though it's just a gift. She shouldn't sell it either, it has to be a full return. Benefiting from the watch in any way validates his entitlement.***

2. She needs to distance herself from him. I wouldn't go full end the friendship because he may still be capable of being respectful but I seriously doubt it. He's been disrespectful so far. I suspect that he's liked her for a long time and she may not have realized it.

TL;DR she has to return the watch, it's a non-verbal message that the other man's pursuit is still on and any refusal to return it is a sign that she's not serious about her rejection. Actions speak louder than words."

But I would caution you, that 3-4x/week is higher than average. Finding an adult who has a full time job and responsibilities who is also willing to have sex once a day like clockwork is difficult.

Maybe explain to your husband that these type of charity events are reserved for those who have it worse off than you. Also Listen to his perspective and try to make him feel heard.

""It's cold"" (""it"" being the atmosphere) vs. ""I am hungry""

or

""It's windy"" vs. ""I am sleepy""

Babies can't do that. Babies, if they could put things into words, wouldn't think, ""I am hungry."" They would think, ""It's hungry."" Hunger just IS. 

Adults who act the way you describe above seem to have the idea that, ""IT IS frustration."" Not, ""I'm frustrated,"" -- not really. Frustration just IS. It is being done to/at them, in their minds. It's a force being applied to them, blowing them around like wind in a storm -- in their minds. 

I would say the red flags are:

* People who think everything they don't like is ""unfair""

* People who feel a need to assign blame on a regular basis

* People who complain regularly about those they are close to/those they know

* People who have little good to say about others

* People who assume others are ""out to get them"" 

* People who are entitled. They have a lot to say about what they ""deserve"" as if merely being them means that constantly being pleased is OWED to them. 

* People who insist on ""compromise"" all the time, but what they really mean is that you never do anything they don't like. At first this can seem reasonable. For instance, let's say you like Italian food best but they aren't fond of it, they like Thai food best but you aren't fond of it, and both of you like Mexican pretty well. So you always get Mexican. Reasonable, right? Well, not really. Sometimes, each one of you should get your preferences prioritized. Sometimes, you'll find something acceptable at a Thai place so they can enjoy their favorite food. Sometimes, they'll find something tolerable at an Italian place since you love it so much. Relationships are about mutual giving -- not about just avoiding everything you don't both like equally. 

* People who are pushy or controlling. Note: this can manifest in seemingly ""positive"" ways. ""No, I won't let you stay out too late... you need your sleep."" ""You can't have a second drink. It's not healthy."" ""I'm just trying to help you become a better person."" ""Oh, but you have to let me buy you this exorbitant thing when we've only been dating two weeks. You don't get to say no, it's a present!"" ""You shouldn't watch shows like that."" ""You shouldn't eat those donuts... they're not healthy."" You get the point. 

Sometimes it's easier to see green flags that indicate somebody is *not* this sort of person though:

* praising those they are close to

* being happy when good things happen to others

* being easygoing when something does not go their way

* having the ability to shrug and say, ""Shit happens,"" and move on when something crappy but uncontrollable occurs

* the ability to own their mistakes without prompting

* they assume that their loved ones mean well and have good will towards them

**The reason it's easier to spot green flags than red flags is because shitty people can sometimes pretend not to have red flags for a little while, but they do not even know what green flags are and therefore cannot pretend to have them unless they are astonishingly brilliant observers of humans, and then have the capacity to put those observations into practice for manipulative reasons. Almost nobody on the planet is an astonishingly brilliant observer of how humans work while ALSO being able to 24/7 prodigiously mimic what they've learned while ALSO being shitty on the inside. When someone seems like an astonishingly brilliant observer of how humans work, and yet they're also clearly horrible, that is usually an illusion based on the fact that decent people project. You know what projection is in a negative sense, probably. It's typically spoken of in the sense of bad people assuming everyone else is bad. But good people also assume everyone else is good. Their own projection of goodness onto bad people is what allows terrible people to seem good, 99.9% of the time. The chances are vanishingly small that a terrible person can actually mimic goodness -- it's just that good people re-write the bad actions of others to show some sort of goodness even when goodness isn't there. It is PRECISELY the same mechanism as when bad people see malice in places malice doesn't exist.**

I have an ex like this. He would blame me for shit that I couldn't have controlled at all. Stuff NOBODY could have controlled. Things that were nobody's fault at all. If I said, ""Why are you angry at me about this? It's not my fault,"" he'd say, ""Well it's not MY fault!"" He genuinely felt somebody HAD TO be at fault about EVERYTHING that went wrong. The idea that some things are nobody's fault was impossible for him to understand. 

What was different about the people I've been with (and the person I am with) who don't do that? The people with green flags? I'll give some concrete examples.

* If things went wrong, they didn't think about blame. They thought about how we could work as a team going forward to deal with whatever thing went wrong. If nothing could be done, they felt sad or frustrated, but viewed me as a source of comfort rather than as someone to lash out at. There's a snowstorm and we can't drive where we wanted to go for a romantic getaway? That was because shit happens, so we'll be romantic at home. 

* They never felt bad AT me, or anyone, unless I had actually done a wrong thing to them. My partner woke up in a funk, or they're sad about something, or they're sad for no reason they can define... Well, in that case, they'll just tell me they feel bad, and ask for some extra help. That's it. No blame. 

* When I made little mistakes, they understood that as normal humanity, not as criminal. They didn't forgive me even, because they understood that forgiveness is only for when somebody has wronged you...  they understood there's nothing shameful or even bad about accidentally, say, knocking over a glass of water. Everyone has accidents like that sometimes. Decent people will say, ""Oh, shit -- want me to help clean up the glass?"" and then when it's all cleaned up, they'll point out that you should both wear socks for a little while since it's hard to clean up every tiny shard in one go.

* They assumed that I meant well and had good will towards them. If I said something that hurt them, they assumed I didn't mean to do that, and simply told me it hurt them and why. I could then learn from it, and they still liked and loved me the whole time. 

I think you can pretty much pick up on this sort of stuff pretty early if you pay attention. One pitfall is that these people will avoid directing that crappiness at their new partner for a while at the beginning. You can still notice this bad mindset in them though because they'll direct it at people who aren't you. At the beginning, they'll come to you, looking for sympathy about all the meanies and unfairness in the world. You'll feel like a great comfort to them.

When that happens, take a big step back. It is not possible that everyone and everything is out to get this person. If they claim that's the case, their misery is THEIR FAULT. And they will soon blame YOU.

Which brings me to my last point: the most important thing here is to break up with someone as soon as you determine they are one of these people. Do not go to therapy with them. Do not try to make it work. Do not try to show them the error of their ways. Do not tell yourself that maybe they're just in a funk. Don't wait. None of that. Just break up. Tell them why, don't tell them why... it doesn't matter. But break up.

Being willing to break up with anyone and everyone who has a trait you find unacceptable and intolerable, as soon as you realize they have that trait, is one of the very most important ways to find someone who *is* right for you. Remember: ""unacceptable"" doesn't mean that you hate a trait someone has -- ""unacceptable"" means you do not accept it. Not accepting it = leaving. If you stay, you are accepting and tolerating this bad trait. Grudingly, resentfully... but you're tolerating and accepting it. ""This is unacceptable,"" has no meaning when you accept it by staying. 

I might say otherwise if this behavior pops up in a longterm relationship even though it's NEVER been there before, and the person recognizes it when you point it out, and the person has always been decent before. Therapy might be a good choice if it comes out of nowhere after a long period of good will. But when you haven't seriously committed to someone yet, there's no reason to stick around. All that, ""Relationships are hard work, you made a commitment,"" stuff only applies after somebody has earned it. It doesn't apply at the beginning. "
386,"...his first priority should be your kids. I understand having your mother there while he’s working, but after work? Weekends? Does he ever take care of your kids? Because this sounds odd to me. Please tell me I’m not the only one. "
387,"&gt;I know something is amiss, and I'm so hurt that I'm considering taking our daughter to stay in a hotel and clear my head for a few days. 

Make *him* stay in a hotel for a few days."
388,"I bet you anything that he's been hooking up with his other child's mother when he's there on the weekends, too."
389,"There's a few things here:

1) Flex works means flex work -you're in the right in terms of the hours you work

2) Just because you're available to answer questions after you leave doesn't mean that coworkers want to contact you- it sets the precedent that contacting people ""after hours"" is OK.

3) If you're getting in early and getting extra info from the boss- of course that's unfair.
It sounds like you might be the boss's ""golden child"". It could be well deserved for sure but won't do a damn thing to stop coworkers being petty.
I'm not saying to hold yourself back, it's just a thing.
People have kids and other commitments that make it hard for them to be in at 7/6:30 so your comment about them coming in earlier is arrogant and inconsiderate. 
It's easy for a 22M guy with no major commitment to come in at 6:30.

4) It sucks for you that people are responding after you leave but given that their working around are 9-5 or whatever, it's perfectly reasonable. You leaving has no bearing on their response rate especially if you want to argue that your hours shouldn't have any bearing on theirs. 

5) Doesn't seem like you make an effort to socialize with anyone outside of your boss- that can be see as ass kissing. 
So social events and stuff are a 2 way street. If you don't organize anything, eat at your desk, leave early and tell everyone they should come in at 6:30- it's not exactly ""How to make friends and influence people"".

In a company there are overt and covert norms.
The overt norm is- work whatever hours you want.
The covert norm is- everyone usually works from at least 8-4.

Sometimes covert norms have more power than overt norms. Especially if despite everything the startup ""culture"" officially states, there's still a culture of ""presenteeism"", especially environments were everyone is co-located. 

It sucks being ""being right"" doesn't always mean that you're going to develop the best relationship with your coworkers. 

Can you compromise from 7:30-3:30?

Also some of it could be gentle ribbing. I have a coworker who leaves at 3 as well and everyone gives her shit but it's not malicious. She just makes jokes about how we all ""sleep in"". No one actually resents her that much. I wonder if some of it you taking their ribbing seriously (i.e. providing swipe card data) and it's just put people off.

Conversely I have someone who starts at 10am but stays till 7 because they are a single parent and want to do at least school drop off. Also gets ribbing about ""how was brunch"" but no one doubts he works hard. 

Also I would talk to you boss but I wouldn't start cc'ing them on everything like people have suggested.

It will turn you into annoyance rather than your coworkers no matter how much he likes you now.

You sound technical smart but perhaps you don't have much emotional intelligence. 
If you current boss was to sell the company off or move on, are you going to have networks? If the answer is no, then you're not getting as much you need to out of your job. "
390,"&gt;My husband **(who had been unfaithful a couple of times before)**

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Why are you still with this guy?"
391,"So you're about to be married, but neither one of you has the courage to openly discuss whether or not to start trying for a baby? 

Have you discussed all the other big topics that you need to discuss before marriage - finances, where to live, having kids or not and who will take care of them, how to divide chores, etc?"
392,That's called barely graduating high school my friend. 
393,"I don't think you're overreacting, and frankly I would have been less forgiving of this shitty BIL a lot earlier on. You have done more than your part. I think it's possible that you continuing your relationship under the circumstances may have contributed a little to your husband not seeing the problems as serious, but that speaks more to your patience than anything. You've done nothing wrong. Your husband continuing to side with a shitty brother, and being blind to his shittiness, even when it's against his own family, is supremely naive, and his failure to stand up to it is completely fucked up. I think the best thing for you to do is draw a hard and clear line so that your husband can't continue to bumble his way through this. Point out every thing BIL has done (like you did for us) and explain the personal fall out for you and how it's made you feel and then say that his NewWife expectations were the final straw and you are reconsidering the entire relationship because of how long your husband has been overlooking this. If even under such clear terms and explanation your husband can't get his act together then I think you're in the right to cut and bail. This behaviour will only continue/ get worse and you don't owe it to your husband to stay (with a CHILD) in this situation."
394,"Honestly, hes wrong and right. He isn't being visited by a ghost, he isn't being punished by god...

397,Block the guys number. Don't ever talk to him again. Don't tell your boyfriend. Never do what you did again because it was shitty and you knew what you were doing. 
398,"Unless something goes really wrong, my husband is never going to meet my mom. She's really horrible. I don't think you understand what you're asking for here. Maybe you'd really be fine with them treating you badly, but what about her? How painful would it be for her to watch them treat you like sub-human scum?

You don't need to meet them in order to know where she came from. And, frankly, considering how baffled you are, I don't think you understand how very bad it can get. There are some times in life when you think you really want to know something, but then once you DO know, you think, ""I can't believe I thought I needed to know/experience this. I wish I could scrub out my brain. Nobody gained anything from that shitshow, and I'm sorry I ever asked in the first place."" 

I do think you may benefit from talking to her more about what it was like to grow up with them. 

As to why she's low contact with them rather than no contact: it's just really hard to cut out one's parents. It doesn't feel natural to do it even when you probably should. I didn't cut my mom out of my life until I was almost 26, because it just took a long time for me to arrive at a mental place where I could do it. "
399,"Of course he wants children. Because that ties him to her financially forever.

I think you'll end up regretting it if you don't say something and I don't think it has to tank your friendship.

I'd start with something like: ""I'm just going to say this once and then I will shut up about it forever and we can pretend like it never happened, okay?""

Then start the compliment sandwich. Tell her how much you love her, and how meaningful her friendship is to you. And how you never want to see her hurt.

Then tell her that you have concerns about the way she is treated in her marriage and that you're worried for her. And you're concerned that bringing kids into that situation could make things worse.

Let her speak then. If she gets super defensive, just back off and tell her that you're so sorry, you just want to make sure that she's happy and that she's sure. And that you love her and you'll never bring it up again.

But she might not get defensive. She might see a window to talk about this. In which case, let her talk and just listen. Don't try to offer solutions, just listen.

At the end of the day, people in our lives have to make their own path. All we can do is tell them we love them and make sure they are certain about the choices they are making."

404,"To be honest, the bigger issue to me is that she's writing him at all. He's in prison for life and he's committing crimes against women while in prison, she's remarried and she's still writing this waste of space?! 

Why?! There's no possible upside to this and anyone who's ever watched prison movies or CSI/SVU can attest there are some *serious* downsides. Yes, *he's* in prison. But maybe his buddies aren't. Or his long time other GF on the outside who decides to get ""revenge"" on you or whatever horrible things you could dream up. She's playing with fire. 

It sounds to me on my gut feeling alone that she maybe tepidly went along with his fantasies or didn't refute them and he's trying to rile up suspicion and trouble because he's an awful person. 

If the wife needs an outlet, erotic literature and other such websites or chat rooms exist. She doesn't need to bring danger and craziness into your lives.

like, for me, personally, even if i was dating someone and we hadn't had the ""exclusivity"" talk, if a dude is still sleeping around with other women after 4 months i'd be done the moment i found out, because clearly our ideas of relationships and how we feel about each other just aren't compatible. you're not in some kind of contract; nothing obligates you to stay in a relationship when you think the other party's behavior just isn't cool."

I would ignore whatever he has to say because he is clearly a scummy bum with a bruised ego. But it wouldn’t hurt to threaten to release all of the dirt you have on him if he doesn’t stop and leave you alone. "
409,"My heart breaks for you both, OP.  Such a brutal diagnosis for someone so young.

I was the one who got severely ill before age 30. Very different and not as bad as your husband as my docs were able to halt (after five years of pure hell) me from dying, and I can walk slowly and generally take care  of myself. It was my poor husband who had to adjust from his once-active and professionally successful wife turn into a bedbound, drooling fool on painkillers, suicidal from from the pain (one serious attempt) who bore the burden of our worlds crashing down.

The horror is you don't have this bright light at the end of the tunnel. People who have not experienced that can never, ever understand the hell you are going through.  All of your emotions are valid.  My husband often lashed out at me despite me rarely complaining and forcing smiles, as the reality was I was in so much spine pain that I was useless as a person and partner.  We were both under 30 when I got sick.

Please, continue with your therapy and if you want to try anti-depressants, give it a shot.  They won't resolve the underlying problems, but maybe meds will help you cope.  Also, try to find a support group so you feel less isolated. You will meet people that truly get your situation.  If any friends or family can help, take that fucking help. You need it and don't let pride get in the way.

Right now you both are living hour by hour, not even day by day, I imagine.  Try to get out each day and exercise, and take time for yourself. I would beg my husband to do the same, but he'd feel so guilty hanging out with friends or working out when he knew I was bedridden and doped up, weeping from severe pain or puking my guts out and he just couldn't do it.

I obviously lived, but the marriage did not.  A major disease is hell for anyone.  You'll have to find some sort of balance or you *will* crack.  This is your new normal.  You don't have to like it, you don't have to make any major decisions right now.  All you have to do for now is find a daily release from some of that agony, even if its just for 15 minutes of distraction.

I'm so very sorry, OP.  For both of you."
410,"This, so much!

411,"Just distance yourself? She didn't just ""act inappropriate"" with your brother. She also told lies about you, telling people you said things that you didn't. That could've damaged your relationships with other people. 

If this was completely out of character for her and you don't want to fade away from her, perhaps just tell her you're not going to be around her any time alcohol is involved, because she did X, Y, and Z, and you're not going to risk exposing yourself to that again. Then stick with it. If you're with her and she even has one drink, just leave. If she makes suicidal statements, call emergency services."
412,"He also invaded their privacy when he read what they thought were conversations with only you, OP. "
413,"&gt; But he came back for his lunch break and woke me up to have his way with me. It hurt and I cried and begged him to stop, but he didn't. He's bigger and stronger than me so when I try to push him away he just pins me down anyway, so I just kind of have to let it happen. 

This is rape. He raped you. 

And yes, the age difference is relevant. He’s counting on you being too young and inexperienced to see what a piece of shit he is. He knows you aren’t as likely to wonder why his marriage ended and if it might have had something to do with his character. He knows you’re more eager to prove yourself and that you’ll put up with more bullshit in order to do so. 

You say you’d be lonely without him. But loneliness permeates your whole post. You feel alone *with* him, and no wonder. He has negative amounts of respect for you. He admits that he prefers you sad and broken. He’s sexually excited by your vulnerability. That’s not just toxic, it’s *dangerous*. This man will seriously injure you someday, intentionally or accidentally, purely because he’ll need higher and higher doses of that powerful feeling he gets from forcing himself on you. Eventually what he’s doing now won’t be enough to satisfy him. 

You’re worth more than this. Listen to your coworker and get out. "
414,Yes she also needs to realize he could easily do this again AFTER they get a house and have a kid. Then what? You’re stuck with a mortgage and being a single mom with way less of a chance of finding a new relationship as easily. Take this as a new beginning albeit how hard that may be. 
415,I'd cut her out so fast Edward Scissorhands would be jealous.
416,"&gt; I know it’s not my place to want to know 

HOW is it not your place? considering you're dating and have a child together? If this was such a ""secret"", he did not have to bring it up in the first place. It sounds like he's using whatever this ""secret"" is to torture you, to try to gauge how you'd respond, or both. A lot of people who have done heinous crimes kind of get off on hinting at it, revisiting the scenario, etc.  


Think of your child. What if your boyfriend's secret is that he's a pedophile and he molested a family member. What if he's done something violent or sick. Your child could potentially be in danger. Or what if this secret is entirely made up, and he's just trying to torture you? Either way, it's pretty fucked up. The only way this behavior would be redeemable, is that the ""secret"" is that he's about to buy you a car. But it really doesn't sound like that's the case.

432,"Allow me to tl;dr this post even more for you, OP:

""My wife is exhausted because she does the majority of the childcare in our relationship and is then even more exhausted when I act all sad and pouty because she is not paying attention to Me, The Centre of The Known Universe"". 

Help. Your wife. With the kids."
433,Get therapy for yourself OP. What happened wasn't your fault and you did the right think when you found out about the abuse.
434,"Dude you are so much in the wrong I don't even know where to begin.

You're insecure to an effing bird for starters.

And she's not ignoring you for the bird, she's ignoring you because you're behaving like a massive jerk. 

&gt;&gt; ""Do you want to go to hell?""

Honestly... even if you believe this, totally inappropriate way to discuss it with her. She's probably upset with you over this. You cannot force people to believe or disblieve any aspects of faith. At the end of the day, you can just witness and let them make their own decisions.

&gt;&gt; ""Have fun with your new boyfriend.""

Wow petty, manipulative, and pathetic.... Yeah, she's probably mad that you were really rude to her and then doubled down with this line. Honestly, just apologize for being so childish &amp; she'll probably forgive you and start talking again."
435,"Your wife is being super creepy (imagine if the roles were reversed). Yeah she is a customer so he isn't going to tell her to fuck off. He sounds 100% professional and never responded to her coffee invite and tried to disengage her flirty texts. This doesn't sound at all like the start of an affair (but the opposite : harassment).

&amp;#x200B;

You definitely need to speak with your wife and lay it all out there (apparently she didn't cheat... yet). Her need for external male attention is most likely a symptom of an underlining issue in your current relationship."
436,I think it’s really telling that the one time Frank seems to speak up in this story (re: Tom’s sudden new wife) is when it seems to have the least amount of consequences for him.
437,"Yeah, this counselor should lose whatever license they have. That's super fucked up. How is that even a compromise? "
438,"They’re overreacting by most people’s standards,  you’ve been an adult for three years, but you are also obligated to follow their rules because you are living under their roof. I would work on moving out (maybe with a roommate to split costs) ASAP so they cannot keep tabs on you or control you. "
439,"It’s a shitty situation with a shitty answer but I think you already know: you shouldn’t have to convince him to be there for you. If your relationship is healthy and stable (and had potential to move forward and grow), he’d be there for you in a heartbeat (or, at the very least, communicating with you instead of going out and getting drunk). 

I had an abortion at 6 weeks and it’s difficult, even when you’re absolutely sure of your decision and even if you have an amazing support system. I know it’s tempting to fight this out with him and drag him there with you, but please prioritize yourself and getting through this. Let your best friend take you. Let your support system take care of you. Take care of yourself, both your mental and physical health. (And be warned that suddenly not being pregnant can cause crazy hormone surges and unpredictable emotions.) 

Prioritize getting through this experience first. For me, his response to this situation would be a dealbreaker—but that’s not something you have to decide right now if you’re not ready. Focus on doing what you need to do, and you can deal with him later if you need to. His response right now is his own problem—it’s 100% not on you to manage his emotions when you need to focus on your own.

Finally, abortion can be scary! Please feel free to message me if you have questions or fears or want to talk about the experience. "
440,"&gt;What can I do about getting back in our apartment to get my stuff? I already know I have to break my lease and pay my landlord the remaining months rent and start the process of moving back into my parents...

You're on the lease and you're allowed to go back and get your stuff. 

If you don't feel safe going back to the apartment and running into your boyfriend, you can either ask a friend to come with you OR call police non-emergency and ask for an escort. 

You're a smart, strong human being and you eventually saw through his bullshit. Let this shitty relationship be a learning experience."
441,"Yeah, um, this isn't about the pigeon. She's not ignoring you because she loves the pigeon better - though she might, at this point.

She's ignoring you because you're an insufferable, controlling and entitled jerk who reacted to her feeling uncomfortable and like her boundaries had been crossed by basically telling her she's going to go to Hell if she doesn't love your church and its weird ways (yes, people coming up to you and ""laying hands on you"" and such when you don't know them is *weird). You freak out if she goes ten minutes without talking to you. You're insecure about her caring for a bird.

You're the one in the wrong here. And I sincerely hope she dumps you hard and has a fun and fulfilling life with her bunny and pigeon pals."

444,"&gt;Ugh, I feel bad for this guy. Your wife is being super inappropriate with him


Ditto.

Beyond being unfaithful the wife is creeping on a dude trying to pay his own bills.


"
445,"So why doesn't your bf trust you enough to deal with guys who hit on you yourself? Why is he going behind your back to deal with this rather than being up front with his concerns directly with you? IMO, this is a yellow flag for sure because your bf seems to want to treat you like a child and I would feel very disrespected in your shoes."
446,"My ex was a lot like this. Petty comments about my looks or how I ate (on the day that I ran a marathon, he commented that I ate too much at lunch--he ate more than me at that lunch and did NOT run a marathon that day, or any day). Taking his stress out on me in a mean way. And it only got worse over time. If this is a regular thing, please consider leaving this relationship. The emotional toll that it can take on you is a lot more than you realize and it can really take a long time to recover. Those cutting remarks, in combination with one another, really take a toll on your self esteem and you deserve better."
447,"The brothers reaction was that of a guilty person. My mind also went there, but i'm truly hoping that's not the case. The brother overall does not sound great, so hoping he has an anger problem rather than that."
448,"""He keeps calling me selfish and lazy because I don’t want to do this."" This is BS and I am so sorry. Your husband is being extremely disrespectful saying these things. What a stupid thing for him to get a bug up his ass about.

Tell him ""it's TheoDORa not TheodorA!"" "
450,"&gt; Like, whipping her 

Literally or a figure of speech? Because one of those is horrific abuse.

Honestly, she needs therapy asap and sex needs to be put on the back burner. Right now, she needs to find a sex positive therapist who works with this issue. It is incredibly common for those from religious households. The whipping part is not common, and she deserves professional help to get through her abuse as well. "
451,Pregnancy crisis centers are frequently religious organizations who will give you resources for keeping the baby and have no options for terminating the pregnancy.

&amp;#x200B;"
453,"You can't make people understand things they don't want to.  I'm a mom.  There is no way he abused you without your parents noticing and writing it off. 

Your refusal to play happy family is destroying her illusion of being a good parent.  She failed both of her kids.  Your brother would have gotten therapy and interventions early and you would have gotten support and safety.  If she acknowledges she screwed up than she has to take on responsibility for how messed up everything is.

She keeps pushing because she wants to believe in her happy family fantasy.  Call her on it.  This isn't about you.  

Go live a happy life away from this trainwreck.  You deserve it."
454,"You don't change his thoughts, you get the hell out of there.  He doesn't love you or even like you.  You are just a proxy stand in for his forbidden fruit. 

You are worth so much more than that.  You deserve to be respected and loved for who you are, not this bullshit.  You ARE more than a damned sex object, now show him that by walking away.  Scratch that, running away from him."
455,"I'm sorry but this is not just about him.  As someone with a traditional opposite sex name I can tell you it's no picnic for a child.  It's impossible to recount all the times I got the wrong token at parties and events or the wrong colored tags &amp; T-shirts.  It may be fun for politically correct adults but it sucks for the child.  If he wants to make a statement, let him do it with himself.

Your husband needs to be thinking more about his daughter and less about himself.   

FWIW, I know a Theodora who has a nickname of Teddy."
456,"Honestly, she could have meant a lot of things ranging from ""the only value I see in you is your ability to impregnate me"" to ""one of the things I love about you is that we both share the same values about having children.""  Whatever she meant she said something that was hurtful to you.  Have you let her know that you were hurt? I think that this has to be a conversation with your wife about emotions and its not something that can be handled strictly ""rationally""."
457,"I agree that OP should've mentioned the planning ahead of time.

But I think there are larger issues here that ultimately led to OP making this decision. Her husband could've initiated a plan for her birthday. It sounds like he rarely does this, and he doesn't plan anything else either. And if he's always relying on her to make and organize plans, of course she's going to like it when another person (her friend) does that for her. OP mentions in another post that he's forgotten or dropped the ball on birthday plans for years. Birthdays are for the people who celebrate them. If you're in a relationship, you should know if your partner wants to celebrate or not, and do *something* for them."
458,"So, your parents gave your sister $192,000 ($1000x12x6 for living expenses plus $120,000 profit from the condo) and want her to give you $15,000?  It does seem like a bit of a slap in the face, doesn't it?

I think you'd be well-reasoned to not only reject the monetary gift, but to also decide that your sister can be the one responsible to help your parents in their elder years.

461,I'm going to be blunt here. You describe him as somewhat pathetic. He sounds like a jealous and controlling insecure person. Yet you keep defending him. So what do you want here? You need to end this. That's the truth.
462,Be kind to Sensitive Elliot
463,"Your reaction only means that you have taken her power away, and she can't manipulate you emotionally anymore. I am the same way with my mom. She can sob right in front of me and I can just stare at her, because it was YEARS of the same bullshit.

There's nothing wrong with you. They pushed you and pushed you and pushed you, and this is the result. I don't know if it's a subconscious need for self-preservation, but you're not a robot or lacking empathy in a general way. You perhaps don't have any for this woman and your family, but in context that makes perfect sense.

I'm sorry you went through what you did, but you seem like an emotionally healthy person, all things considered. "
464,Frankly your brother’s reaction is pretty troubling. Is that kind of reaction normal for him? Is he known to have outbursts? 
465,"Well, that's creepy and unprofessional. They sound like teenagers. Who talks like that at work with and about their coworkers? Fuckin gross.

You could ask her why she does that, I guess, and tell her it makes you uncomfortable. I'm guessing someone who does something creepy like that at work lacks boundaries to begin with so I don't get the sense she's going to care much... good luck with this one? "
466,[removed]
467,"&gt; I can't really figure out how the employers and HR are going ahead with sponsoring OP's family if they're not actually in financial trouble; I mean, they know how much OP and her husband both make.

They know how much they make, but presumably not the details of their expenditures. I'm sure everyone at OP's work is aware that her child was just in the hospital for several months, and they're more than willing to take her husband's word that the family is deep underwater, financially speaking. I'm sure OP knows what she's talking about when she says that HR would be very surprised to learn the family is doing OK and is going on a vacation soon."
468,"You did the right thing, OP. "

470,"My husband is like this. I guess if I could pinpoint anything about our early relationship that was a red flag it would be the word “fault”. He was always very concerned about who’s fault something was, even things that had no impact on him or was none of our business. He’s since turned into the kind of person who will blame everything on someone else, anyone else, usually me. "
471,"That's a good explanation I never thought of. I will definitely have to have her clear that up when I talk to her again. She was very insistent on getting married before kids, and with good reason, as it does come with a lot of benefits. Thank you for this comment!

"
472,"Everyone here needs therapy. Your stepdaughter needs therapy the most. Foster care doesn’t teach you how to exist in a family. It just teaches you how to survive.

You need therapy bc your world got upended by finding out you have a stepdaughter a decade younger than you. 

Your husband’s life got upended by finding out he was a unintentionally a deadbeat dad for almost 20 years. 

And in the meantime, set up a bank account where an allowance is deposited at a regular interval so she feels like she has some control. "
473,"I kind of wonder if he feels uncomfortable talking to OP about his concerns because he knows she will poo-poo his worries, and make him feel bad for being worried in the first place. Perhaps that's why he's been confiding in coworkers.

Going thru bankruptcy seems like enough to justify anyone being on edge about their finances. He is probably still feeling pretty raw and vulnerable financially.

When he talks about how ""dire"" the circumstances are, sure it may be a bit dramatic, but it may be legitimately how he feels, and OP telling him it could be worse is kind of just sweeping his feelings under the rug.

Do I agree with him taking the charity? Probably not. But I agree that this is something that they need to be on the same page about. Each of them need to acknowledge each other's feelings and treat them as legitimate.
"
474,"Post this to /r/legaladvice 

Go to the police. File a report for theft. Take screenshots and use them as evidence. 

"
475,"I know you say this is so out of character for him but you have to listen to what he is saying, right now, and take that into consideration. To me it sounds like he wants to be with this other person. Don't try to talk him out of it. Let him. 

I would stop any and all conversations and just start the divorce paperwork. There's a saying about careful what you wish, you might just get it. I think that applies here. While everything looks awesome with this new girl right now its not going to be. He barely knows her. You can't save him from this mistake. He has to make it. Simultaneously you can't keep letting him treat you like less than dog shit by telling you he doesn't want to be with you anymore and you just stick around hoping he'll change his mind. You have to walk out of their head high. 

No one in your life, no matter how many years or how strongly you feel for them, is worth you disregarding your own self respect to stay with. That person at all points in time should want you to be confident, secure, happy, and their top priority. When they aren't, and flat out refuse to make you their priority you don't stick around begging them to. If they won't go to counseling or talk about it you have all the answer you need.

I'm sorry you have to go through this. You're 26 and you still have plenty of time to find someone who would never do this to you and have kids with them. But you can't waste a minute more with your husband. Contact a divorce lawyer first thing tomorrow and start the proceedings."
476,"&gt;I have no idea what to do about this or if it’s fair to expect my boyfriend to stop being friends with them or if I should just forgive them or what.

Those friends would be banned from my house, not only for their terrible gun safety practices but for the rudeness and disrespect after the fact. You might also ask your boyfriend to reflect on what he gets out of a relationship with people who make fun of him, peer pressure him, and disrespect her girlfriend in her own home."
477,She is doing it on purpose for sure at this point. Feel free to use whatever tactics you see fit...playing the most obnoxious music you can find during these sessions is a start. Something so bad it will spoil the mood.
478,Thanks for your insight. Yea I'm having doubts now. It's chipping away at my love for him. In general he IS Petty and mean when he's stressed. It's so awful and I'm tired if dealing with it. I never lash out at him like this when I'm stressed.
479,"&gt;  I’ve had our baby for 90% of the day. He got up 40 minutes ago with his famous line of ‘back in a second’, and he is now upstairs playing pool with his dad.

482,"&gt;  She wants to visit Australia soon too and I am not sure I want to spend much time with her and her boyfriend, 

Absolutely do NOT host the boyfriend. He treated you abominably. She might say he’ll act better. He won’t. He’ll stomp all over you and your friend will allow it. 

And I suspect if you told your friend you’d be willing to host her but not him, that would be the end of it because her sole priority seems to be him (and his body parts).

I think you should tell your friend how hurt you were by how she allowed you to be treated and how little effort she put in to your visit. IF she responded with a sincere, heartfelt apology and a true effort to make amends, I’d consider forgiving her. I think it is much more likely that she’ll make a lot of excuses and possibly try to put the blame on you for how things went, and in that case I’d say goodbye to the friendship. 

By the way, this: 

&gt; I even cancelled going on a trip with my family to a place I had been waiting to go to for a long time so I could be with her the entire month

486,"Yes this. I’m a private/outdoorsy person myself and I really didn’t think it was clear that you didn’t want anyone else knowing *about* it. I thought you just wanted the location to yourself. 

Edit to add: honestly it just sounds like he was really impressed by you and couldn’t help but brag."
487,I’d be done. She was willing to sacrifice a 3 year friendship for a married guy she spent a day with. That’s not okay. She had no qualms about making you look like shit and straight up lying about you. That’s a shitty friend.

I think his reaction was definitely strong but could it have been an emotional/irrational reaction to having this sprung on him?

She acknowledged that that was fucked up, but seemed to be okay with it after **he reassured her that our relationship was failing** and he was about to back out of it after he got the strength. This has apparently been going on for around a year, maybe more if he deleted older correspondence.

At least he said something that wasn't a complete lie (see bolded text above). But....ugh. What a piece of shit your husband is. I am so sorry.

Look, the trust is gone: he has broken this relationship irreparably. It's already over, so don't feel guilty about ending it.

Don't say *anything* to him, just screenshot all texts/proof and consult w/a divorce attorney ASAP. It'll be hard but don't say anything until then.

"
495,"First of all this man is dangerous. Stay away from him and don't talk to him. I don't agree with people saying to block him. He sounds like a prime candidate for escalation as he needs power, control and attention and you aren't giving in to him. Set your phone up to where it saves his texts and calls but you aren't notified of them. 

I'm not trying to frighten you but as a fellow woman your age whose gone through some shit, you may need this evidence to file a police report and to get a lawyer to send a cease and desist letter.

Second, do not pass go, do not collect $200, go straight to gym management and inform them of what is going on. That this trainer is a neighbor of yours, you had a falling out, and after that he started showing up at your gym to harass and intimidate you. Tell them the specific instances you laid out for us here. Then, and these are the key words here, say ""This person makes me feel harassed, intimidated and *unsafe*. I am considering switching gyms to avoid him because he is starting to frighten me."" Don't say it in an angry, hostile tone. Say it calmly with a worried look on the face.

Trust me, they'll want to keep you over him. Clients are lifeblood to gyms, trainers are a dime a dozen.

If the man ever contacts you again electronically, tell him *once* ""At this point you are harassing me with unwanted contact. Never contact me again."" Boom. That's it. Done. You are done responding.

The thing is if you need an RO or an OP, they won't grant it unless you have proof you've made it clear to the person you want no more contact with them and they continue to contact you, and you need to cover your bases.

Sorry you're going through this. Narcissistic insecure men on power trips are one of the banes of womankind. Make sure you have some buddies who you are in frequent contact with and never go anywhere unless some other person knows where it is and how long you'll be out. "

There is nothing wrong with being affected by tragedy—the way your boyfriend has gone about it, however, is self centered and bizarre. As a gentile, there's no religious reason he should be upset, and especially if he didn't know anyone that died and doesn't live there anymore.

I think this speaks to an incredibly narcissistic person that likely extends beyond this one instance. Think carefully if this is the kind of person you want to be with."

 He's surprised you're considering divorce? No he's not. He's manipulating you by purposefully downplaying his reaction and playing dumb to convince you this was just a little oopsie. 

He was on multiple websites looking for escorts. He didn't get a fucking no sex massage I can tell you that right now. He actively sought these women out and had sex with them on multiple occasions. He's playing dumb on purpose because look at your reaction -- even with it this fresh it sounds like you're already starting to second guess yourself.

Talk to a lawyer and file for divorce. There is no other option."
511,"Seriously, this.

Also, pregnant women aren't supposed to be cleaning litterboxes, so if he can't handle doing that it's going to be a huge problem. Not to mention the other issue, that your cat(s) are being neglected - are you sure he's even feeding them?! And if they're throwing up all the time, something is seriously wrong.. your cat(s) need a vet visit. And he should have noticed that.

OP, I'm sorry you're having to deal with all of this on top of your other responsibilities. But your husband is a slob, is neglecting your animals... tbh I don't see how you could bring a child into all of that, your husband will probably neglect them too. Your husband needs to step up or get out."

521,"I'm concerned about the lying and that you felt you should have acted differently around him after you found out he was a prof. However, I'm not concerned about postdocs dating professors, as this happens often and is not the same kind of power dynamic as if you were a student, imo. (Edit: of course, unless this person is your supervisor!)

First of all, starting the relationship off on two lies about age is a serious problem. If you're not comfortable with this, that's totally understandable.

Secondly, you aren't being tested and you don't need to present yourself a certain way to your date whether he is a prof, postdoc, grad student, or not in academia at all. The fact that you  felt stupid about the honest things you said concerns me for how stable you feel in this area and for how you would approach this relationship moving forward. It's great if he suggested some things to read, but you don't want this to become a teacher-student kind of dynamic, right?"
522,Get rid of him. Not even gonna change his child’s diaper? Pathetic. Your step father IS your father and your idiot boyfriend doesn’t get to make ANY comments about YOUR relationship with your parents considering he’s not you or your step dad and obviously doesn’t have a blended family like you so. The dude sucks. Men should make the decisions? Lmao ok. This relationship isn’t going to work unless you totally agree with him. 
523,"Maybe wake up really early and take a long ""shower"" (I mean, obviously shower too) and get the business done in the bathroom with the water running. 

The good news is that at that early hour, it's unlikely that anyone else will be awake. If anyone does hear it, they won't comment probably but if they DO, you can always laugh it off as travel related or Thanksgiving overeating. 

I mean, farting is funny but it's not rude per se, especially if you're not doing it on purpose! 

One thing I did learn in (of all places) the ""Urban Survival Guide"" is certain yoga poses help gas escape more quickly---can you go outside for a ""coffee run"" or ""workout"" and do those poses and get most/all of the gas out more quickly than it usually would and then come back in ""refreshed"" with Starbucks for the fam? 

Apologies if you already know about those poses! (I believe it's basically child's pose, held pretty tightly). "

529,"&gt;Yeah I think it's cause she knows our dad would expect her to contribute to bills whenever she stays with our parents it all explodes pretty quickly cause he doesn't tolerate her shit.

Your sister is using you. She gets free housing, utilities, childcare, and maid service from you, because you don't draw the boundaries your dad is willing to draw. If you're ok with this, then... ok, you do you. But don't expect to change anything about your sister - if your dad couldn't teach her how to be a self-reliant adult, there's no way in hell *you're* going to be able to.

You are not actually your sister's only hope - she *could* stay with your parents (but she chooses not to because you have no backbone). She could look into what assistance is available to homeless mothers.

I think you should assume that your sister is going to continue to dump childcare on you, contribute no money, trash your house, and make *zero* progress towards moving out even after her medical issues are resolved.

How long are you willing to live like this? Make a plan, communicate clearly to your sister exactly how long she is welcome to stay, and be prepared to have to go through a formal eviction process to get her out in the end. (*Probably* your sister is too lazy to bother going the legal route, but... better to be prepared.)"

It was something growing up that I always felt different and kids in my class would make fun of me cuz I wore hearing aids. I have always felt ashamed of my hearing problem and always hid it from people and only open up about it if you are really close to me like a best friend or boyfriend.

(I still have my hearing aids but only wear them if I am going to be in a situation where I need to hear everything which is rare). 

Anyways- my husband knowing this, if I ever make a negative comment about it saying I have a disability, he always corrects me and says “no, you hear fine, just differently than I do.” Or in some form that way- which always makes me feel better.

If someone were to constantly point out that I have a disability over and over again. It would probably make me feel even more ashamed and depressed about it. It’s already a touchy subject just because of how much I was made fun of. I certainly don’t need people trying to “diagnose” me.

You say you stay because of your daughter- by staying you are teaching her that this is how she will deserve to be treated by men when she grows up. Is that what you really want for her?

544,"Hey there - his comments alone are a deal breaker, no matter what your experience with mental illness would have been, but there’s an extra reason for you to bounce, OP. 

You had an ED and that just doesn’t work like a cold - you don’t get over that shit, you manage that shit. You manage it by being in an environment that is safe and non judgmental, with a partner who boosts your self esteem as you keep working on it. 

You *don’t* manage it by being in a relationship with someone who has borderline dysmorphia and who uses your illness as a way to “take you down a notch*. 

You have worked so hard to get better and you’re at risk of letting this guy, if you’re with him much longer, tear away all of your progress. 

Surmounting an ED is no joke! It takes some serious mental fortitude and will power - don’t let this guy make you lose sight of that. Find someone who has a healthier outlook on their body - and mental health. "
545,"&gt;  I know he wants to change

No he doesn't. If he wanted to change, he'd change. He's not failing to change because of some weakness or because he just needs help. He's failing to change because changing is uncomfortable hard work that requires a lot of introspection and attitude adjustment.

546,"I think you should've talked to him first, as soon as your friend told you about it, and with a soft approach of ""oh hey, Friend wants to do this thing for me, and she has the plans, and I wanted to let you know she wants to take me in this girls' trip.""

Then you could've offered to arrange for all the childcare, etc, so he could also have a break, once he informed about the trip.

551,"u/augustavalon - this is the best comment IMO. 


Your brother “ruined the family”, but he’s trying to put the blame on you because you aren’t rolling over and doing what he wants (and your parents are). I agree, he needs to lay in the bed he made.

Personally, if this were the kind of brother I had, I wouldn’t be close to him. Being your brother doesn’t mean that he gets a free pass to be a douche. If his now-ex provides a more valuable relationship to you than he does, then fuck it. Stay friends with her. As long as you’re aware that he/your parents will probably throw a fit about it, then have at it. 

(IMO, if your blood family is behaving irrationally and making your life worse because of having a lower standard for morals than you do... i wouldn’t blame you for seeking a family elsewhere.)

That said, if there are no kids involved and your brother/his wife are divorcing, she shouldn’t be given invites to any family events. Treat it as if they were only boyfriend/girlfriend and broke up. You have every right to be friends with ex-gf, but ex-gf doesn’t still get an invite to family events.

If you don’t want to attend family brunches etc. because of how your brother is acting, you could either not attend or walk away/separate yourself every time he brings her up. (If he’s gonna act like a dog, might as well train him like one, lol...)"

554,Sounds like a HR letter and the girl would have to sign it lol 
555,"I think if their hi-jinx impact your work you should definitely bring it to your boss.  Either directly, or (if your company culture permits) create a paper trail with email and CC him on your requests for information.  If they don't respond, follow up with another email CCing your boss to ask whether they've 'had time' to get the information.  Obviously don't do this if you think your boss is going to be annoyed by getting a lot of trivial emails.

If you go the direct route, I wouldn't frame it as 'snitching' but take more of a 'what can we do to resolve this situation in the best way?' approach.  

I don't think there is a lot you can do about the social aspect.  If you're always eating meals at your desk then part of the problem might be that you're giving of an unfriendly and unapproachable vibe that's contributing to the situation.

Another thing to consider is whether your work hours are impacting *their* ability to work.  I have a colleague who works similar hours to you.  There have been a few occasions where urgent work has come down the pipeline after she's left the office for the day, and I've needed to ask her questions or have her fill out papers that then have to wait for the following day, which leaves me to deal with the fallout from unhappy customers.  I wouldn't react to her with hostility as your colleagues are doing, but it does make me feel a bit less inclined to prioritise her requests for help from me, if you know what I mean?  Just speculating here so if this doesn't apply then feel free to ignore."
556,"Hijacking this comment, because honestly this is the best advice on this thread, that maybe she needs to work out again. If she enjoyed exercising before having babies, she may miss it a lot. I know when I don’t work out, my brain doesn’t function properly and my self esteem plummets. In fact, I used to sound a lot like the wife there. But working out even semi regularly helped me so so much. 
 
So maybe one of the date nights could be a fitness class together? Or when partner watches the littles, wife can go for a walk or to a yoga class?"

In a perfect world you'd show up to the party with cops and embarrass the fuck outta him.  But that's maybe a little too dramatic, but blowing up his phone and demanding it back (and breaking up with him obvi) or he should expect an invoice for $1100 (extra as an asshole tax) "

563,"This might sound silly, but when we were much younger, my partner and I had pretty much the same conversation. The solution we came up with was that we promised if either of us ever started to feel like wanting to leave, we'd give each other plenty of forewarning. Somehow that agreement made us both feel better and allowed us to relax about it. :-) In more 25 years, we've never needed to warn each other. :-)

We still sometimes tell each other ""I don't know why you're with me, you're so amazing"" but it's more a way to give each other a compliment nowadays. "
564,I know! It’s like he’s trying to rub it in that he’s having sex with her. He didn’t need to tell me. He said he did because he didn’t want me finding out some other way. I haven’t spoken to this girl in 7 years.
565,"Actually she cleans up and takes care of the baby while he only plays with the older kid.

570,"Yeah I guess you're right, they treat me fine and haven't really said anything in regards to my job. They seem to just be happy that my girlfriend is happy so I guess I'm probably just overthinking this."
571,"You've got to grow a spine and shut down her guilt trips. As long as you eventually give up your stance of independence, you're teaching her that she can still control and manipulate you through guilt. It's like dealing with a toddler, if you give in to their tantrum after an hour, you've taught them they get what they want if they tantrum for an hour.


Don't give her an address for where you are going. Don't tell her when you are leaving. Every time she tries to guilt trip you, stand up for yourself. Every time she pulls the ""it's what mothers do"" just say ""no, mothers prepare their children to be independent and happy adults"". She probably doesn't treat your sister the same way because she can't get away with it like she does with you. She may be helicoptering you, but you are enabling it. She needs an information diet, stat. 


It seems like you wrote this hoping there was another answer besides the long overdue formation of your backbone and I'm sorry to tell you there isn't. If you want her to stop and are financially independent then you've simply got to stand up for yourself. Just tell her you need a mother, not a smother."
572,"&gt;I opened the conversation and saw that my husband has been texting back and forth with this woman for weeks

So your husband has been cultivating a separate relationship with this woman for weeks.  He's already lost track of boundaries and has now  begun to divulge confidential information to her.   That's a much bigger issue than you seem to appreciate.   

&gt;Most of it was innocent, 

*None* of it is innocent.  Flirting is an invitation for further engagement and your husband, an expectant father no less, is happy to encourage her.   Over half of all extra-marital affairs occur between co-workers who cross one boundary after another until they lose sight of their own moral compass.

This work ""friendship"" is on a bad path and he has to shut it down now.   No more texting, or socializing at work -- as of now, his interaction with her should be strictly professional, as-needed basis

*Not Just Friends* by Shirley Glass - get it, read it, discuss it with your husband.

573,"Can I just jump on the coattails of this comment: he hasn't even been with this girl. It's so one-sided.

**Edit:** also...*why* does he want the child to come live with you guys, and why is this happening now? Is it at all possible that he's giving you this ultimatum because he ***wants*** a divorce, and he wants it to be ""your fault""? Let's think about this. his relationship with your children is getting worse as they get older and more able to see through his bullshit...maybe he wants to go live with his jump-off and their easy toddler, neither of whom make demands on him. 

**Edit again:** Are you 100% sure this child exists? Has your husband offered any proof? Has he had a paternity test? Have you met his affair partner? These are all important questions, this is going to affect your child support and any alimony you're awarded in a divorce. I think your first step should be to call a divorce lawyer and start getting advice on how to move forward.

**third edit, jesus:** Honestly, how did he portray this - did he say he wanted you to look after this child? These questions go along with my first edit, but if the child's mother is still alive and has been the primary caregiver, it seems highly unlikely that he's going to be able to get sole legal custody unless she basically *gives* him the kid, or she's taking such egregiously bad care of him that CPS is already involved? Which is why it seems more likely that he's just posing this unbelievable ultimatum as a way to exit the marriage. "

I assure you, I have known him for a long time and know that he is not gay. He is also a beast in bed. For many women, this is an totally excellent combination in a man.

Your father-in-law is deeply ignorant and very sad. Can you be confident in who you are and ignore this terribly limited person? Subtly push back when he says these ridiculous things to you?

595,"Seems to me that she wants your continued attention and emotional support without having to feel ""obligated"" (because, yes, that is how she views it) to have sex with you.  In fact, she was so tired of performing this obligation that she unilaterally called for this ""break"" in order to get physical separation from you so that she doesn't have to worry about you trying to initiate sex with her any more.  And it's not like you're asking for the world here; no sex in half-a-year is ridiculous.

Seems to me that you two aren't going to be sexually compatible.  And, as you should now by your age, the frequency of sex rarely increases in a relationship.  Odds are that the amount you two are having it now is the most you will ever be having it if your relationship continues (and, as you should also know, there is a high likelihood it will decrease even further as the years go by).  If you are ok with that, then that's your choice.  For me, I would recognize that my partner and I simply aren't sexually compatible, wish her well, and move on to find someone whose sex drive is more in line with my own.  Because if you don't, your relationship will keep going forward (and likely she will want it to be more ""serious"" with a marriage proposal or something at some point down the road), and eventually you will find yourself in a dissatisfying LTR like a lot of folks on the deadbedroom subreddit."

Something is incredibly messed up in her that she even wants to engage in this.  Would she be with her ex if he were out?!

Confront her and insist on counseling immediately.  She is cheating and she is violating your sexual consent with those fantasies."

598,"&gt; On this trip we even discussed that our relationship is platonic and that we're friends, and that we love that we can be like this together.

Platonic means not sexual. **Your relationship isn't platonic at all.**

You have an emotional bond (best friends). You kiss. You have sex. You're intimate. You go out together in the city (these are basically dates). You go on vacations together. He stayed in your house for weeks. From any outsiders perspective, you sound like a couple.

There's no way that *at least* one of you doesn't have feelings. "
599,"&gt; I'll let her know what happened. I feel guilty somehow, like it's my fault for letting this happen

That is the conditioning society has forced on you, that any time something dealing with relationships goes wrong, it's THE WOMEN'S FAULT. 

Stop that. Deep breaths. 

*You are not responsible for his emotions or behavior, only for your own*.

"
600,"He knows you take self defense. You learned how to get out of chokeholds. And his first thought is you cheating because of two faint bruises? He has no trust in you.

Find someone less paranoid to date.  Also way to go on self defense classes. Those sound awesome. "
601,Sex should not be a ‘favor’ and you shouldn’t feel guilty for asking or wanting it. Sex should be a normal thing in a marriage that is beneficial to both spouses. It connects you emotionally as well as physically.  Sex is a big deal. 
602,Do you want to spend the rest of your life with this dynamic?  Bored and unfulfilled?  No?  Then you know what you need to do.
603,"I don't blame your family for being wary of this. Your girlfriend is not just ""a bit"" older than you. She is way too old for you. A well-adjusted woman her age would not seriously date someone your age. You definitely should not move in with her. "
604,"It doesn't sound like anything inappropriate has happened besides some levity in a work environment. All the rest seems to be your insecurities.

Perhaps your husband could be better about not triggering your insecurities. But really it sounds like you're always looking for things about this coworker to get upset about.

I'd suggest looking inwards instead of blaming her/him"
605,I sincerely believe he's 1) gotten used to you cleaning up after him when he makes a crazy purchase like this and 2) he believes at this point so long as he apologizes half heartedly you'll forgive him. No matter what he does.
606,"Does anyone else spend time talking with and hanging out with her like you do? It's possible she feels appreciative for you and simply likes to ""pay you back"" for the time by doing favors

It's also possible she like *likes* you"
607,"OK, this is all going to sound very severe, but that's because this kid sounds like a school shooter in progress. 

Get him out of the house in a safe, supervised way, then search his room. Go through *everything*. Empty all drawers and examine each item.  Also, check areas of the house where he could have hidden stuff outside of his room.

You are looking for anything that looks like a weapon or could be one, including sports items like baseball bats. If you find guns, you need to call the police.  I'm sorry, but that is very serious.  Call a lawyer and call the police.

You are looking for any electronics, including USB drives, SD or microSD cards, portable hard drives, etc. Take them all. You should find a trustworthy IT person to go through them with you, get off any logins or files he needs for school, and identify anything you need to know such as threats he's sent, who he's contacting, sites he's on, etc.  You should also make sure to take his phone if he has one. He's forfeited all trust and privileges with his behavior.  He gets to do his schoolwork under supervision on a shared computer from now on.

You are looking for any powders, pills, plant material, aka drugs. Again, consult a lawyer and then report to the police after you have made sure you know how to navigate the situation and court system. 

Take everything not-illegal you found and store them outside of your home, in a place he has never been too and can not get into such as a secured storage unit.  If you found obviously illegal stuff than the police should be called to the house.

If he runs away, report him to the police. 

In the meantime, get him into therapy ASAP. Look for a counselor who has experience dealing with this kind of thing, or if you can't find that specifically than someone who has some experience with deprogramming/cults might be good? 

Talk to his teachers and the school, see if they can provide suggestions for counselors or for support groups and services in your area. "
608,"You can't get her to tell you the truth. Reach out to your dad, and figure out how to have a relationship. Put your mom in timeout so she can't meddle while you sort through all of this."
609,"&gt; I’ve asked him to get a job for years now. 

That's a sentence that no one should have to say. Especially about another adult. *Especially* especially about someone who is supposed to be your partner. He's been leaching off you for YEARS, girl. He's not your partner, and he's not even your friend. He's a parasite. I'm sorry to be harsh, but that's the truth.

You need to leave."
610,"“Boyfriend, I’ve told you the truth. What you do with it is up to you. But I can tell you that if you *continue* to question my character and integrity when I have *never* given you reason to think such terrible things about me, you will be creating a *very big problem* where none currently exists.” "
611,"Just a heads up that mental health issues are extremely prevalent in Ph.D programs, this is especially the case with depression. 

The last thing I would recommend for someone with addictions and other mental health issues is pursuing a Ph.D. It is an extremely competitive and high stress program in almost any field and academic jobs can be very difficult to come by unless you have something extremely special to offer (or fit into a category for a ""diversity"" hiring). 

I would suggest if your brother is into academics, get him into a Masters and try to structure it so it offers industry applicable skills and education. The odds of achieving an academic job as a Ph.D are low and it can be very hard even for people in a good place mentally to take. The extra bonus of going for a masters is that it will give him time to get his academics more in line and to build a better position for applying to a Ph.D program if he really wants to go to one. "
612,"Yeah, at this point, I'd be like ""if you've done something you think I would leave you over, then clearly I need to leave you now.  Or, you could tell me what it is and let me make my mind up myself about it.""

I hate patronizing people.  If you have information I need, just give it to me.  I'm an adult, I should be making my own decisions.  And if someone is purposefully hiding information that is relevant to my decisions, I'd be pissed.  That's not a good partner."
613,"Imagine your parents being so spineless, that they decide to sell their house and move instead of kicking their brat daughter and her loser boyfriend out of the house?"
614,"&gt;I don't want to split up my family

So you want them to live with an abusive father?

You want them to learn from the example he is setting?

You want to teach them that abuse is okay?

"
615,"You may need to just keep your head down until you turn 18 and can move out or go to college. It sucks, my dad yelled at me too much when I was a kid too, just for different reasons, but it gets better when you don’t have to be in the same house anymore. "
616,"People normalising practical jokes in cars? I'm with you OP, that shit's immature and the last thing you should expect from adults."
617,"There's no way you can bring this up without starting an argument, because he's a mooch.

You got engaged to a man who couldn't even afford to feed himself, six months into the relationship. Da fuck were you thinking?"
618,"I'd be upset, especially since there was no attempt to remedy it at all... like falling asleep while your wife eats dinner by herself on your anniversary that you forgot... he has a lot of work to do. I'd make sure first that he's okay though in terms of his stressors cause that could explain (not excuse per se) certain behavior

I know the feeling, it hurts to not feel valued, to feel like you're being taken for granted, but it's not your fault you're being treated that way "
619,3 months in and he has already been consistently lying to you? Not the greatest start to any relationship worth holding on to.. 
620,"&gt;I got a small bonus (just north of $50,000)

&amp;#x200B;

My dude. Your bonus is nearly the median salary in the U.S. I'd be real, real careful to keep that in perspective during this whole time. Holy heck. If I'd just been laid off and my SO referred to $50k as ""small"" and/or ""a bonus,"" it would take every ounce of restraint I had not to scream. Tread lightly."
621,"Thank you for your kind words! Yeah ultimately I'm goi mg to continue with what I want...but it still hurts that my family is reacting to what I want to do like this. It feels like they're almost calling me worthless, because they don't see any worth in my career. "
622,"Our friend group had a friend like this, oddly enough her name actually was Sara.  I was never the victim of her copying, but a few of my closest friends were at varying times.  

Things we started to do: 

Called her out when she said something contradictory.  When she spout her batshit insane backstory we just gave her the JLaw Okay gif face.  

We started lying about what the person she was mimicking was doing to see if she’d do it.  She did, of course, and then she looked really chagrined when we were like “oh man you thought Andy* was going to do that? No way! It’s so cool that you did it though” 

Eventually she got tired of mimicking one person and moved on slowly as her behaviour was ignored.  

She’s now in her 30’s and she still hasn’t grown ... I would call it self awareness, but it’s more outward awareness that everyone could see what she was doing?   She’s married with kids now, and 99% of her conversations are about herself or the friend she latched onto the most in high school.  

She then says she’s lonely.  It’s like she genuinely doesn’t realise what she’s doing/has done.  

So basically keep things you actually want to keep to yourself on the DL, but things like hair colour? Have fun with it.  Mention your hair colour in advanced but lie about it, so if she does it first you can safely change your mind.  If you’re already dying it every couple of months, there’s no way her hair could survive dying it twice as much to correct your mistakes. 

Give her tentative locations about where you might go, until you’ve actually got there or come back. Then it will be more noticeable to other people. 

Also, if you really want to have fun, last seasons wardrobe or thrift stores.  Make it impossible for her to find that outfit. "
623,"Also, don’t tell any new friends that E is trans. It should be up to her who gets to know and who doesn’t, for personal reasons as well as for her own safety."
624,"Yeah, I’ve been here before. It’s like you get so panicky &amp; desperate to get it back, that your normal/rational feelings go away. You accuse and suspect people close to you just because you feel like there’s nothing else you can do. At least if it’s someone you know then there’s hope of getting it back - if it’s a stranger then it’s hopeless. 

TBH OP I feel like your bf should not have told you because it’s not going to do anything but make you feel like crap. This accusation likely has nothing to do with how his family feels about you, it’s more something done out of desperation. It’s like when you are mad and you say things that you regret. His Mom will probably be mortified when he tells her he told you. "
625,"Get a box that you can lock with a padlock for your snacks under the bed.  Talk to the RA about a stronger response to being drunk in the no-substance dorms, because 18 is below the legal drinking age and you CAN call the cops if the RA isn't doing anything about it.

Scout the library or other quiet places where you could study instead of the dorm.  See if you can get some ear plugs and a sleep blindfold to deal with the 3 am noise.

Otherwise, I've had noise issues with the guys on my floor; my dorms were single occupancy but the walls were thin.  Neighbor liked to play rock loudly, during the day to relax and at night to cover up sounds of sex with his flings, and I was also across the corridor from the floor conference room where they liked to play DnD loudly till 5 AM every Wednesday.

And I can tell you that I tried direct confrontation and politely and nastily asking them to quiet down, as well as passive aggressive things like playing tennis against the wall early in the morning, and leaving my stereo set on max volume and auto-repeat and leaving for class.  Nothing actually worked; the only thing I did was establish that I was as much an asshole as they were, and then everyone continued to not care that others may be inconvenienced."
626,So fucking childish. It's almost difficult to believe that OP is the youngest one in this story - their co-workers sound like they just graduated from high school!

628,"I know! ""All you did is put clothes on"". I bet he did just that and then had the nerve to complain she did the same.

EDIT: a word. oops."
629,"&gt;Or if I should just ghost them both, and wash my hands of it all, unless I actually do hear from a lawyer? (Which I think is unlikely tbh)

Ding ding ding.

You'll never hear from a lawyer because this is as absurd as it is petty, so please don't lose any sleep over that.

This woman is crazy, and crazy is best kept at a safe and quiet distance. Block her on anything she contacts you on, save and screenshot messages from her in case you ever need a restraining order or to prove harassment, but other than that don't respond or do anything."

631,"You're a prop to her.  

When you were shy, insecure and depressed, she kept you around so she could look better by comparison.  

Now, she's trying to drag you down again and is threatening your job.  

She may have ""saved"" your life once, but now she's threatening it.  I think you need to come to terms with the idea that the J you once knew isn't in existence any more.  "
632,"Dude......you should just head on over to Deadbedrooms right now to see what’s in store for you, oh my god, every comment you make reveals another glaring red flag. I hope for the best for you, but honestly......none of this is good. "
633,"And he's not down for Theodora, which is the female equivalent?"
634,"PP also has hotlines, as well as a text/chat system. Talk with one of their people, both for information and also so you can have support from someone who has experience with this. 

For the people who are focused on making them pay for it out of principle, I am assuming that these teens have learned their lesson, are scared, and that there are bigger fish to fry. "
635,&gt; I just want to leave and go back home.
636,Then leave and go back home. This guy is out of touch with reality. Making you exercise in order to eat? Oh hellll no.
637,"I can't imagine asking this of someone I've only been dating for 2 months! And a student with limited financial resources at that. :/


Agree with others that his story doesn't make sense.

To me this reeks of manipulation.  Tread carefully, OP. "
638,"Addtionally:

640,"I'll be honest, his ex-gf being in a car crash a week before you come over shouldn't effect his ability to make time for you even if he was to go out and see her.

From what I've seen of people in online relationships, there is often one party that bails approaching a meet up date as things are suddenly to become real. This is a big possibility but I'm not saying it's definitely the case. 

I definitely wouldn't cancel unless you can get a refund. You could use the time to explore the country by yourself and turn it into a good, empowering experience.

"
641,"Yes, hire help or get free help around the house.  Call family.  If he doesn't like it... too bad.
My father took care of my mother for 5 years while she slowly died from ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease).  He called me many times, sobbing and breaking down. ""She's just going to die.  She'll never get better.... only worse.  Why am I doing this?  I can't win this battle.""


My response to my father was, ""You're doing this because shes your wife and you love her.  You're doing this because you said vows.. ""In sickness and in health""  You're doing this because its the right thing to do, and you're a good man.""

I wish I could help you.  Find that inner strength that you didn't know you had.  Find it and help him as best you can.  If you dont..... you're going to feel guilty about it for the rest of your life.

Prayers for you.  God bless and good luck. "
642,He’s trying to sabotage you. 
643,"I'm so sorry you have to go through this. He's crazy. He's gaslighting you for shit he knows is fucked up and crossing to many lines. You did great though. Tell your friends and go to the police. He's got serious problems. He read all your conversations with your friends, I think it's a good thing to let them know about that. "
644,"...also... the ticket number will be linked to the plate which is registered to him. He will now also have hit and run to deal with. 

"
645,"Imagine swapping out his behaviour for another form of abuse and trying to make this sentence work:

&gt; The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can’t bring himself to stop hitting me.

&gt; The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can’t bring himself to stop cheating on me.

&gt; The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can’t bring himself to stop murdering people and making furniture out of them.

&gt; The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can’t bring himself to stop calling me names.

It doesn't make us feel bad for him at all."
646,"I think it's gross he courted a 16 year old girl in his 20s and married her before she was even old enough to vote. I hope you realize healthy people don't do this. 

I think your husband needs a lot of therapy. The tragedy of his first wife and his overly religious upbringing has put him in a place where he doesn't have any tools to understand what's going on with his feelings."
647,Your friend sounds like an awful person.  Having history is not a good enough reason to maintain a friendship when everything else has changed. 
648,"What you need to do is tell her that the only way that you will continue going to a counselor is if it’s someone neither of you know personally. 

I agree, very unfair. "
649,"seems kinda silly of your HR/company to offer charity whilst *employing* *both* of you. i would go talk to HR and have a blunt conversation, saying that you appreciate their gesture but your situation isn't as bad as your husband made it sound, and you'd rather they donate that stuff to a local shelter. and then kick your husband in the shins for sharing private financial issues with coworkers!"
650,"My brother cheated on his ex girlfriend. Multiple times, with a few women. Also had bad excuses, not that any excuse was good. She finally broke up with him and he slandered her name all over, stalked her, stalked the guys she dated &amp; tried to get them all fired from their jobs. Whilst he was doing this, my parents decided the best course of action was to abandon my brothers ex girlfriend to raise their daughter mostly alone with no support  (except she has an awesome family) from them. They said my brother needed love and support and a free room and free childcare so he could go out and date girls on the few nights he had my neice. 

This has gone on for years. My parents basically act like my brothers ex girlfriend did something distasteful, and no one talks about it. No one had anything to say while he was trying to ruin his ex's life, except to reiterate that he was just going through such a tough time. 

I dont see those people anymore. I dont speak to my parents, who are enablers and who have proven that they will abandon the mother of their grandchild because they are too scared of my brother to do anything else. I obviously dont see or speak to my brother. It's been almost a year. 

I do see my brother ex girlfriend, and my neice. We had a sleepover this weekend. We dont speak of my family. I enjoy having decent people in my life, and will fight to keep it that way. "
651,\*Why\* does he want to name her Theodore?
652,"&gt;Our relationship has essentially turned into a shit show ever sinceI told

It was one already, you just didn't realize it.   Your 20 and supporting a 25-year old a$$hole so you get a one-time pass for being so young. Get rid of him and look for resources in your area, starting with Planned Parenthood.   Stay away from Pregnancy Advisors -- they will be worse than your  STBX boyfriend"
653,"Are you absolutely sure you guys are officially a couple?

Some people are not that into social media. I find it extremely irritating when people start randomly tagging me to stuff, so maybe it was one of those things. 

But seriously dude, you talked to her and she said you were clingy. You need to give her some space. If she wants this, she will come around. "
654,"I agree.  I have spent large amounts of money on once-in-a-lifetime things before - but the money for that comes from a savings account where I *save* in order to be able to buy those experiences.   

$1000 out of nowhere is “actual life or death emergency” sort of money.   It would be different if he was paying for a last minute plane ticket to get to his dying relative.   It would be different if he’d needed to sign off on $1000 worth of rattlesnake antivenin.   It even would be different (although frustrating) if he’d spent the money to repair his car so he could keep going to work.  Spending that kind of money on frivolity, especially without consulting the other person with a stake in it, is disrespectful and just plain bad money management.  "
655,"&gt;Boyfriend expects dessert when I pay but never returns the favour. Halp 

Stop buying him desert. You can't control what he does, only what you do. 


ETA:

&gt;J has always been very tight with money which I don't mind at all, I'm not the kind of girlfriend to demand. 

Honestly, being with a stingy partner is a problem. Especially when they're happy to take from you but not reciprocate. There are no cool girl points, you don't win a prize for accepting bad treatment from your partner. "
656,I think telling people to stop doing the right thing because it may look bad to outsiders is a step in the wrong direction for society.

662,"Based on what you've written here it sounds like if you were able to have PIV sex with her today you'd still hold all this bitter resentment and anger towards her. That's not healthy. You should get therapy too.

Having fights about it and expressing your feelings with her in unhealthy ways can set her progress back because it adds to the pressure she no doubt already feels. 

PS: Neither of you are virgins. There's more to sex than PIV and plenty of people have satisfying sex lives without PIV. "
663,"I mean not to be rude but your freinds shouldnt decide what you two do with your lives. What you have going on sounds very nice and if you wanna date then by all means, you should."
664,"Stop doing this. I am a parent of children your age and my advice to kids is to take your adulthood because we aren't going to give it to you. My kids would not tolerate this bullshit from me for one second. 

Explain to your mom as kindly as possible that she overstepped her boundaries and that she can't treat you like that. Stop telling her where you are, who you are with and what you are doing. You don't owe her any explanations and shouldn't be giving them to her. 

Tell her you aren't sure that living together is going to work out. Be as kind and firm as possible. "
665,"I’m extremely surprised that you correctly assumed the family dynamic. I didn’t know how to include it in the post without seeming bitter myself but you hit the nail on the head. 

Tom is the golden child and Frank has lived in his shadow since day one. Frank’s older, yes, but has always been enamored by Tom his entire life. 

I guess it’s hard for me to say, “from here on out you have to defend me,” because I’ve been asking for a defense from the start. I feel like saying “ok but starting now,” would be running in circles. It’s also hard for me to want to defend myself when I know I won’t have any backup. Frank has told me several times (like in the instance of being attacked by the ExWife) to “be the better person.” 

His reaction to Tom’s NewWife news was exceptional, but encouraged by me. We had found out through his mom that Tom was married and that Tom wanted to tell Frank himself. We had several conversations about it before the call, and Frank initially didn’t want to rock the boat. I encouraged it. "
666,"Honestly, the fact that she's a lesbian is just icing on the cake. Anyone would be miserable in this situation. He's a mooch.

668,"I'm a fully grown east asian woman and I've learned (the hard way) that one of the biggest red flags in dating is when a non-Asian guy has an addiction/fetish to Asian porn. Like ONLY watches hentai or Japanese AV every time its time to do the deed. It's naive or just plain in denial to think that consuming that type of media constantly for x number of years wont have any affect on your perception towards women/Asian women whether its on a conscious or subconscious level. I find it deeply disturbing and potentially dangerous unless the person is VERY aware of their addiction, the potential harms, and is actively trying to get better before its too late (one of my exes was successfully able to stop watching teen porn after YEARS of near daily addiction with the help of a therapist and my support at the time).

Everyone here will say the boner is a red flag. In my opinion an addiction to lolli-hentai is also a major sign. "
669,"OK, then I think your husband was doing the right thing here. It would have been far worse for him to have left her there by ~~himself~~ herself. "
670,"Just wanted to add that Tom is Jealous of Frank.


While Tom may have been treated as the golden boy of his family, he is clearly jealous of you and Frank's relationship and child. and does seem to be doung everything possuble to ""one up"" Frank. Such as his failed probably rushed marriage to ex wife and his clearly rushed marriage to current wife not to mention attempting to take mothers business from you.


I think Frank is reluctant to act because he knows that what he has with you is special and he knows on some level tom is jealous of it, but he doesnt want his brother to hate him over it"
671,"I am the woman in this scenario. I was good friends with his sister, she completely cut me out because its “her brother”, and that was up there with the pain he had caused. Their mother isn’t that much better, They are trying to befriend me (3 years later, child involved) and it’s too little, to late. They all broke my heart because of his actions. If you could stick some form of relationship with her, I can say from a place of knowing, that it will mean a great deal to her. "
672,"You're displaying a lot of maturity and clarity by refusing to let your father's attitude define you. It's really difficult for a lot of people to think for themselves and then stand by the opinions they form, so it's pretty impressive that you can say this so emphatically at 16. (I hope that doesn't sound condescending--I just sympathize a lot with this situation) Unfortunately there's not much you can do to change your dad's mindset, because it's not based on logic or reason. What you can do is shut down any interaction where he starts carrying on about his weird idea of masculinity by grey rocking, a tactic where you just become as boring and neutral as possible until you can end the interaction. I can't link in this sub, but google it as it's a really helpful technique. Sorry your dad has such outdated views, please don't internalize his bullshit or let him discourage your openness and creativity, even if you can't share that side of yourself with him."
673,"Seriously. Not even surprised when OP said this:

&gt; the comments [were] unanimous in saying that he was abusive

"
674,"TBH this sounds like one of those ""tests"" that insecure people do... you're only 4 months in, so he probably thinks this is the perfect time to see if you'll be loyal or helpful or whatever he thinks your reaction to this weird story will prove. I'm guessing (based on similar stories from this sub) that he will follow up eventually with some kind of speech about how yes this was a fake scenario but he's disappointed with how you didn't immediately jump to help him by offering to pay all his bills, and that he would do the same for you, etc. If it turns out to be this, please run far away immediately, people like this are manipulators and bad news. If it isn't this... well, honestly I might still run. This all sounds like a lie or a way to get money from you, I wouldn't be comfortable with any of it either. "
675,"It reminds me of the kids in high school who would be PC to the point of erasing the voices of actual marginalized people who had dissenting opinions. In high school one of my best friends was a trans boy, and people were always trying to crusade for him in an offensive, patronizing way and actually made him an accidental pariah by being so aggressively defensive. If someone misgendered him he would reply, “hey uh it’s actually He” and I grew up in liberal urban Canada so 99% of folks would say “oh okay, sorry about that, man!” But some of these crusaders would attack people to the point they’d be nervous to talk to my friend. When girls didn’t want to date him, the crusaders would call them transphobes. And when he finally got a girlfriend, they accused her of only dating him to fetishize him. He truly couldn’t win. Literally moved to the middle of nowhere where no one knew he was trans partly to escape the patronizing nonsense. "
676,"&gt;For context, I'm the breadwinner and pay as many of the bills as I can without asking for money from him. 

Another buried lede...as in my boyfriend is a leech and I didn't want him to take advantage of a waitress too so I tried to cover for him.

&gt; I thought everything was going really well. 

Things rarely go ""really well"" when one partner is living off the other as you describe your situation.

678,"There's no justifiable excuse for a 27 year old man to be ""friends"" with a 15 year old girl. End of story. Spending time alone with her is absurdly inappropriate and stupid on his part. This would be a relationship jeopardizing issue for me that he even started doing it. There's a very good chance she's attracted to the older and ""mature"" attention from him. He needs to stop feeding into it."
679,"I loathe saying things like this, because they seem dramatic. But Jesus, another day--another post on this sub about a grown ass man who won't wash himself. 

No more laughing. No gentleness. ""You're a grown ass man. Wash yourself. This is disgusting, not funny. Bathing is mandatory, not optional. I should not have to tell you this. I should not have to beg you not to be disgusting. You're an adult. Act like one.""

And if he refuses to get his shit together? Dump him. You're not a rehabilitation center for crappy adults. You're a grown ass woman looking for a grown ass partner. If he refuses to be one? Throw him back. He's defective."
680,"Block her on Instagram, facebook and snapchat. You won't be able to move on if you keep checking her up/getting notifications from her."
681,"Bankruptcy is a ""dire"" type situation. Presumably it means you have no financial assets or access to credit. That's an extremely bad financial situation. Consider that to get approved for bankruptcy you had to petition for it and someone had to look at your finances and go ""yep, these people are fucked"".

It's not poverty so you're almost certainly right about this aid and the risks that would come with accepting it. However you would fit plenty of peoples definition of poor. That you've been poorer doesn't matter.

You should have a meeting with a meeting with HR to clear things up. It will be weird if you go in there and say ""husband is full of shit"". Explain that you don't have cash flow or living day to day issues, but rather had medical and legal debt you needed to bankruptcy out of. Presumably something that would rack up both of those would be known to HR as it would have involved time off? Should make it easy for them to get the idea. Hell, specifically use your upcoming vacation as an example of why you shouldn't receive that aid. Then even if they don't rescind it for whatever bureaucratic reason you're still in the clear.

You're not going to be able to reason with husband if you can't admit you're poor though. Think of authority figures losing trust in kids on the topic of hard drugs when they talk about pot like it kills. Dudes stressed and venting to coworkers. Your financial situation is getting to him and its not unreasonable that it is. Acknowledge it, give him the P word, and then explain the aid is for people that can't afford vacations at all. "
682,I CALLED THE FUCKING COPS GUYS HOLE SHIT I'M SHAKING but it feels damn good
683,"1) stop texting him, because he burnt bridge anyway with you. And while at it, block him on social media
2) Change your locks because he burnt bridge &amp; is untrustworthy anyway.
3) Do tell his sister  anyway because you'll find out if she knew or not, and if she know about it - you can cut her out of your life too.
4) if possible, go away for the weekend or day trip to take your mind off of it and him for a while. If not, enjoy staying home to wallow a bit and/or throwing stuff out especially of his. 
5) Remind yourself, you don't need him like he needed &amp; used you; so the moment he he fails and runs back to you, do not take him back and waste any more of your time with him  (such as being permanently engagement/never will eloping nor marrying you). 
6) You will eventually have to tell others such as your parents about this but 1st you need to take a break for yourself before bracing yourself to them.

You will get through this and move on. So tonight, if possible, go out to movies /window shop/dine out to take your mind off pain for a bit. "
684,"If they do find out that you were pregnant, tell them you miscarried. If he decides to be spiteful and tells them about it, tell them that he is lying to get back at you for leaving his cheating arse. "
685,I feel guilty confronting him honestly. I can't tell if he's flirting or just naive. I don't know how to bring it up without being accusatory.
686,Im so shocked that their friends study disability and are still trying to 'treat' someone. I study disability and on my course its all about how people with impairments are not disabled untill society disables them and how it's society that needs treating not the person with an impairment. 
687,"TBH, it could be as simple as religious indoctrination... Or the fact that they're expecting their fourth child in less than 5 years! Sex drives can tank during breastfeeding and pregnancy.

She never had a real chance to learn to enjoy sex if she's only been taugt sex negative messages all her life."
688,It's honestly one of the funniest excuses I've heard yet. You made the right decision in leaving. 
689,"😂 guilt probably. Our kids were best friends growing up, he knew I was single for alot of years and my family was doing alright financially so throwing a ring on someone who had it all except a ring was probably exactly what he was looking for. This post sure opened my eyes. Now I'm planning my leaving this relationship. "
690,"&gt;He says I'm being petty, pathetic, sneaky &amp; devious. Am I?

No you are not and what he thinks doesn't matter anyway.  Why are you giving him the power to upset you and make you question yourself?  

You do not have to report to him about anything and put his parents on an strict information diet too.  He is not entitled to know anything but the arrangements you make for his visitation.   

Do not do as another poster suggested on your other  post and  feed his unreasonable expectation by letting him know what you plan.  The more you tell him, the more entitled he will feel to know more.   And just refrain from getting pulled into these types of discussions."
691,"Find house C. 

You’re both right in some ways. If you bought A, you’d need to understand it isn’t an investment but could be a fun place to live. If you bought B, you’d need to know it could be years before school district matters. 

Ultimately, are your dreams based on the house or the family life in it? It sounds like it’s the family. Keep looking. "
692,"Not to say she has an ED, but, personally speaking, mine was/is all about control. [ETA that therapy sounds like a great idea. Congrats on looking for help.]"
693,"Block him, but take screenshots because you may need to go to the police if this escalates. He may be a stalker and you may need to get a restraining order from this guy if he’s already acting like this. You guys aren’t even dating, and he’s sending you that many messages and being this controlling? Please contact a friend and tell them about the situation to ensure your safety. Losing your favorite coffee shop is the least of your problems. "
694,"He doesn't want to marry you.  If he wanted to, he would have.  At this point, even if you could push a ""marry now or I walk"" ultimatum, he'd agree to the engagement and delay the wedding as much as he could.  Then, when you had finally frogmarched him down the aisle, he'd resent you for forcing him into it.

If you're ok with never marrying him, stay.  Some people have great unmarried relationships.  If you want marriage, though, you need to cut your losses - he's made infinitely clear that he doesn't want to.  The whole ""I want to afford a ring"" thing is crap.  You don't even want to wear it!  Couldn't he have at least said he wanted to save for a house payment or something?  "
695,"Simple rule of thumb....if it's not 2 x yes it's a no. It would be interesting to find out why DH wants a third. 
"
696,"OK who does this?

What's up with him?

Why would he expect family he doesn't have a good relationship to comfort him? I can understand being upset about this event seeing as it happened where he lives - it makes people feel unsafe and threatened. But is this how he operates on the daily because he sounds exhausting?"
697,"Intentions don't really matter nearly as much as the actions themselves.  So what if he is just naive?  That doesn't mean he shouldn't be asked to stop.  He needs to learn to be more aware of how his behavior affects you and others around him.  He should not be complaining to a coworker about his pregnant wife, ever.

You bring it up without being accusatory by avoiding saying something like ""you're an asshole and cheating on me"".  Instead, you say things like ""I expect you to shut her down when she says a relationship with her would be fun/exciting/better"" or ""I feel hurt that you are complaining to a coworker about our relationship problems"" or ""I feel you are painting me in a bad light during a difficult time in my pregnancy""."
698,Your friend is concerned about the man who assaulted you wasting money on a lawyer? What the fuck?
699,"""He said that he's not going to bother with Thanksgiving and just stay depressed at home.""

Oh cry me a river. Does he tantrum like this every time he doesn't get his way? Stay broken up."
700,"The point is, he shouldn’t be *volunteering*, he should be going ahead and doing it without a second thought. “Offering” to cut contact does two things:
1) Makes you the mean mommy and the bad guy. Which is a bad idea if he’s looking for reasons and justifications to disrespect your marriage. 
2) “Offering” let’s him look like a good guy when the truth is, it’s really just hedging his bets. There’s a 50% chance you’ll say *“No, it’s okay. I trust you to be appropriate from now on.”* (Read: I really do want to ask you to stop but then I look like the hormonal, over-reacting bitch and it makes me the bad guy). "
701,"My parents said ""I love you"" to me multiple times a day while I was growing up, and they expected it back.

Because of other things they did, I've come to understand that the phrase can mean ""I control your life utterly in every way down to the last detail of how you spend each second of each day, and I expect no less than absolute fealty at all times, no matter what.""

I'm saying it a lot less to my current boo.  It's workin out fine for us."
702,"I don't think you need to talk to her if you don't feel like it.  She's decided that having a relationship with your ex is worth the potential destruction of your friendship.  Anyway, what could she possibly say that would be helpful? She can't undo her choices, and it doesn't seem like she has any intention of splitting up with him.  I'll just save time and tell you what she'd say:  ""We never wanted to hurt you"" and ""It just happened.""  Which of course is BS, since they made a series of deliberate choices, first to get together and then to conceal it, with the full understanding that it would be hurtful to you--they just decided they cared less about that than each other.  It's their prerogative to do that, of course, but she doesn't get to also pretend that it shouldn't hurt your friendship.

When you run into her, I'd treat her like a casual acquaintance--polite, but no depth.  Throwing a scene will just make her feel superior, and staying friends seems like an impossiblity."
703,"&gt; and I didn't know if me showing up would help or hurt that. I also have no idea if she was just saying that stuff to see if I'd show up regardless or if she genuinely didn't want me to come.

I understand that you’re going through a period of uncertainty right now, but it strikes me here how unclear your communication is as a couple. In a solid relationship, you would be able to ask once, “Do you want me to drive to the vet right now?” &amp; your partner would be able to clearly communicate back, “Yes, I could really use the support” or “No, I’ve got this, but I’ll keep you updated if you’re still awake.” The times ive had to go back &amp; forth as much as you two have here were times that I was not in a good, solid relationship. "
704,"I agree I don't think what you are doing is sustainable. Could you move somewhere closer to family for support or help with the kids. I think you need to let him know you are at a tipping point here and if you can't work out a compromise together where he could continue his career as is, then he needs to find something else. His profession shouldn't be more of his identity than you and own children. "
705,"I appreciate it. I’ve been cheated on before by an ex and hung around hoping things will get better and they don’t. I wasn’t going to the that same girl again. Did I want to leave? No. I was so excited about this job but I wasn’t going to be heart broken, in a city I don’t know, living with someone who has no respect for me as a person. "
706,"So... I come from a culture where families bathe together, which stops when the kids get to an age where they start to feel more conscious about their bodies. While nudity isn't a taboo, there are much stricter boundaries around touch. What I'm getting at is that even with this background, I feel like something's not quite right about a kid as old as 9 clinging to someone older (much older at that stage of development) while naked, and that's not even taking into account what sort of nudity is normal and appropriate in your culture at that age. Personally I never knew a 9-year-old who would do that, or a 12-year-old who would let it happen. Alone it could be nothing, but combined with your brother's reaction, this makes me sort of uneasy."
707,You know why he has bad luck with women? Because he's an asshole. Leave him and find someone who likes you for you.
708,"Oh my god, I can't wait to hear what happens when the cops show up at this party and say to the birthday girl, ""Ma'm, that necklace around your neck of stolen property,"" and EVERYONE looks at your boyfriend and he just stands there praying for meteor to strike him then and there."
709,"Imo could either be that dudes super frugal, not interested in a specialty coffee lifestyle, and is communicating that like an asshole.

Or, dude lacks respect for you and is intentionally having his lifestyle subsidised because he can and he's an asshole.

""When I buy a particular quality of product, it's because having a nice version of that product is important to me. When you replace it after helping me consume it, and pick a cheap worse version, I can't help but take it as disrespectful. We've talked about this before so you're aware I'm not just buying things at random, you're aware of that when your hand is picking the item off the shelf or while you're dialing Little Ceasars. What gives? Are you aware of how unfair it is to eat nice things and replace them with cheap things? Are you uncomfortable sacrificing savings for slightly higher quality consumables and this is how you're choosing to communicate that?""

Should reveal something one way or the other.

That's just the consumeables though. Gaming system vs cactus cutting is something else all together. From your phrasing, you got him the gaming system and then later on he got you a cactus clipping? There was no big discussion on finances or an attempt to return the system to you beforehand where he expressed discomfort at exchanging gifts at that value? I can't see that as anything other than disrespectful using of you.

"
710,"I didn’t even read the post bc you need to LEAVE HIM
If he doesn’t respect your wishes or opinion
HES NOT THE ONE BOO
You’re young you will meet someone new
But if you have that baby you will resent him, resent the child, and be miserable FOR EVER
This is a life changing event and should not be taken lightly 

TLDR; leave him

EDIT: Okay after reading this
Just makes me wanna say leave him even louder
Give his ass an ultimatum 
Say for you to continue through the pregnancy he has to be THE PROVIDER like his bullshit bible says
He won’t 
He will never change or get a job
He is a lazy piece of shit and you deserve better
God this infuriated me"
711,"I'd be honest w/ your bf and show him the messages. He might know of an enemy who's jealous or out to get him. 

Also, you're right to not believe him without proof. For example, I have a female friend who I go on walks with and occasionally go to the gym with, and although people may assume things, it's completely innocent."
712,Listen to your mother. Because she's right. 
713,"No, him being an asshole is about him being an asshole, and I really really REALLLLLLLY doubt this is the only time he's done this sort of thing. He probably hasn't been this blatant before, but I'd bet there have been a few little jabs here and there..."
714,"&gt; how do you whip figuratively? Serious question.

Verbal lashing. Scolding. I was really hoping that is what you meant. 

Yep, she needs extreme amounts of therapy to work through all of this. She needs to make sure the therapist she sees is sex positive. She can look for therapists over at PsychologyToday that check the boxes she needs (domestic abuse, sex therapy, trauma + anything else she feels she needs help with). 

Until she has her own control over her sexual body again, it is really recommended you two put sex on a hold. "
715,"It’s OK to break up. In fact, it’s a good idea. You are romantically compatible but have different sexual orientations. It’s more than just a libido mismatch.
I was in your shoes. Ultimately, breaking up was the best choice.

Some commenters are giving your GF shit for “lying” but hell...she’s young and asexuality is still gaining acceptance"
716,"I wouldn't even bother. I was in a similar relationship for a year and a half. Paid for everything, his parents paid for his lifestyle. He never bothered to work. Much happier being with someone who can support themself."
717,"Well it sound like you already have your answer. You realized that you were caught off guard and overwhelmed by the fact he complemented you which is something that doesn’t  happen to you. Just explain that to him and tell him you’re in a committed relationship. And cut off contact with this dude.

Be sure to tell your boyfriend too if it’s something that keeps bothering you and it’s something you think he should know."
718,"Talk specifically to the manager who he had that run-in with before.  He may have promised he's ""better now"" and be there on that promise, but it's clear he's using the gym to stalk you.  I bet she'll toss him right out on his ass."
719,"I know what you mean when you say this, and totally agree, I just wanted to tag on to say don't ""help"" your wife. Just handle your shit.

That is a bit of the problem, is that, generally, men are taught to ""help"" their wives. So then they ask what needs to be done, or wait to be asked for help, etc. When realistically, it would be leaps and bounds better if they just went ""Oh, this is my house too. These are my dishes/my laundry/my floors too. And I notice the floor/laundry/dishes need to be cleaned. So I'm going to do it, because it's my house too.""

Saying ""Help your wife"" with responsibilities still makes them her responsibilities. So if they don't get done, it's because she didn't get them done or delegate them. OP needs to just needs to get shit done, because they are his responsibilities too."
720,"I think it's pretty absurd to suggest that she had to consult you before purchasing medication - which may not be what you're doing but it sort of sounds like maybe it is?  

It's frustrating that she spent money she didn't have to if she had stopped to think (assuming she knew she was about to be covered, and it would handle that sort of thing, etc). On the other hand, for nine months of medication that comes out to, what, a buck and a quarter a day?  That's probably not worth being super upset over. 

So if you talk to her, make sure you communicate, ""In the future, I might be able to help us find other strategies to save some money here,"" (i.e., we're a team! when we work together, good things can happen!) rather than, ""You have to talk to me before you take medication prescribed by your doctor."" (i.e., you can't take of yourself without my permission!)

The former is reasonable, the second sounds super-controlling and borderline abusive. It's the difference between pointing out that there are advantages to consulting you and that she has an obligation to do so. "
721,This is a very empathetic and heartfelt comment. 
722,"""and I can't invest all my spare time in someone if it's not going to go anywhere.""

Unnecessary and kind of a dick thing to say. The rest of the paragraph is perfect with that removed "
723,You should not teach them forgiveness at their own expense. That is how you get a future abuser or abuse victim.  You cannot have a happy family with an abuser.  I’m sorry but your husband has ruined that.  You need to adapt to reality.
724,"HR. This is sexual harrassment. 

And at some point he is going to creep harder or with more pressure on someone less strong than you."
725,"&gt; I do regularly offer to do more around the house.

Stop offering and just do more stuff around the house when you see that it needs to be done.  If you are asking her to assign you tasks then you are putting all of the emotional labor of running the house on her and that's exhausting.   "
726,"Sorry but you need to say ""as long as she needs is not acceptable to me, and this is also my home"". Then tell him the length of time that would be ok with you- if there is one. "
727,"My first thought was SCAM as well, although I assumed his “wife” was in on it somehow. 
Have you done your due diligent internet stalking? Find Clarence (maybe Clarence parent’s with a real nice marriage.) and his “wife” on FB and whatever else if you’re curious enough? 
Also, ghosting sounds amazing. "
728,Nope. If my fiance opened our home without asking me I would be furious. Have you expressed to him why this isn't ok and told him your hesitations? Maybe you two can come up with a time constraint for his sister so that it seems more manageable- but you should absolutely talk to him about this so he knows not to do it in the future. It would make me feel like he doesn't see the home as ours- just his 
729,"I had the same initial thought that it was strange OP seemed to assume her husband couldn't take care of the kids, but now that she's clarified (""He and I work opposites because our kids don't go to daycare""), it sounds like the husband takes care of the kids every day while OP works. OP's reasoning makes sense now. Sounds like both the kids and grandma would love to spend the week together."
730,"On a side note I think its great that you want to pay for everything on the front end, but as a personal finance thing I just want to throw out a suggestion.  Having a loan at a low interest rate isn't a bad thing.  

Let's take the house example so lets say you buy a 100k house with 100k you had stashed away so we don't have to deal with tax issues of selling stock or something.  So on a 15 year fixed mortgage @ 4.46% interest you end up paying 762.95/month and 137,331 overall.  Ok so if you paid up front you just saved 37k.  But what if you took the mortgage and instead invested the 100k and made the 762.95 payments.  If you invested that sum and averaging about 7% interest you would end up with 205k.  So a 67k gain.

Hell even if you took the payments out of the investment you would be left with 80k and your house paid in full, of course with some more tax debt."
731,"THIS. It is not going to be amazing the first time (especially for you), but you guys will grow sexually and realize what you like together."
732,"She scammed you.  Sending money electronically (Paypal, Venmo), asking for money back as a separate transaction, and then reversing the first send is a common scam.

Cut her off from all money and the friendship."
733,"Consider:

This question would not sound juvenile if you asked *how* to have the conversation with your family. But you’re more asking if you should mention it before; essentially you’re asking if you tell or ask your mom first. And I understand that it’s semantics. But you should realize that this is a sign that you may not be in a position to maturely advocate for yourself. And that means being in a relationship with someone 10 years older is a risk. 

The age gap is worrisome. Your management of the situation makes me worry for you. And I think you should seriously consider making your own boundaries, ie what do you want to have established in your life before you move with a partner? And I strongly urge you to consider getting a new place together if you still decide to move in. Don’t move in with her. You’re already looking at a massive power imbalance. Do not leave your mother’s home to go straight to the home of your 30 year old gf. 

Foresight is hard and harder at 19. Understand that your situation is not unique. You have chosen a relationship of increased risks. "
734,"&gt;He had made vague threats of telling my parents who are super catholic and would probably disown me and never speak to me again if they knew I was considering this.

That's extortion. He is trying to extort you into having a baby. He is an abusive asshole and you should end the relationship immediately.

&gt;Where I do or who do I contact about ending the pregnancy?

Go to the Planned Parenthood website and find the one nearest you. Give them a call and they can help you out.

&gt;Am I really overreacting to this? I

If anything you are underreacting because you haven't dumped this guy on his ass yet. What you do with this baby is *your choice* and your choice alone. This is your body and your life that we are talking about."
735,"So you're best friends plus have good sexual chemistry... Sounds like you're 90% in a relationship. Things are obviously not ""platonic"" on his side. Why not just go for it? What's holding you back, aside from outside pressure from friends? "
736,"Well, no, your wife is not ""about to have an affair with your realtor."" So, that's the good news. He's not even involved in this. 

The bad news is that your wife is HITTING ON your realtor without being encouraged and shows no sign of stopping. This is some odd-ass behavior. Has she been a creepy wackadoo before? Is she under some extra stress? Suffered a loss recently? People have affairs all the time, and I'm not excusing her behavior, but this is NOT an affair. She is acting gross with a professional and *not noticing* that he's not reciprocating?? Having an affair is clearly inappropriate, but she's ratcheting it up to like 11 with her unwanted advances. 

Weird, creepy, early-midlife crisis, fawning behavior aside, bottom line is: your seemingly happy wife is thirsty AF for another man. The next guy will probably say yes. You must confront her with the texts. "
737,"&gt;He took a credit card out of his wallet, put it in his pocket and then left his wallet in the car?

I agree that everything after this is weird, but I need to tell you and anyone reading this that as a former retail cashier for many many years, people do this ALL the time. Constantly. Daily, everywhere. Men leave their wallets in their cars and women leave their whole purses. 

It makes no sense to me either."
738,"My mom kind of makes it a “him or me” situation. I feel like I’d be secretly meeting with the enemy... 

But, yeah, I see your point. I’m just having a hard time trusting any of the information I’m being given, and my brother is firmly in my mom’s pocket, so that doesn’t help. "
739,"&gt; We both have work and can't take time off right now.  
  
With all due respect, you need to consider doing so.  And I think it's ridiculous that you want to pay a neighbor to subject themselves to your hateful son.  
  
I would consider removing him to a different school.  
  
&gt; When we took his devices away before, he ran away for a weekend.   
  
So now he knows all he has to do was runaway for the weekend and his parents will no longer take his devices.  Take them all.  Let him runaway.  &amp;call the police to report him.  You're enabling him.  Have you spoken w/ the counselors at his school?  Teachers?  Parents of his friends?  His old friends?  "
740,"You know they're supposed to refuse blood transfusions for religious beliefs right. Also no holidays, no birthday celebrations. It's a big one to fake."
741,"Sounds like she fears an actual diagnosis.  She may fear a diagnosis would reveal something crazy, like leprosy or whatever (phobias are not rational).

You've already tried rational arguments, so because it's getting to you, it's time for irrational arguments.  Drag her to the doctor or threaten to break up the relationship, basically."
742,"&gt; He's told me if i won't stop being friends with her then I'm ruining the family.

...says the guy who RUINED HIS FAMILY by fucking around.

"
743,"They *literally* teach you that in a concealed carry class. It's goddamn fundamental. Your boyfriend needs to grow a pair, educate himself about guns, and find some less dangerously stupid friends. "
744,"You can't ignore the loans when figuring out if you're spending more than you can afford. You two need to sit down and layout a real no BS budget with allllll your expenses down to that $1 deli coffee and transportation and loan interest, and then compare that to your income. Make a plan to cut expenses or increase income. Consider taking over the responsibility of paying bills so that you know what she's signing you up for. 


Finances are the #1 thing that break up marriages. Love is not enough. You have to work together to solve this financial difficulty you're in. "
745,"No he wasnt.

And the kind of reaction your brother had looked like a very guilty one. "
746,"Two days a week is perfectly reasonsable, especially if you're spending the remainder of your time with her. Hold your ground. You are allowed to have hobbies and a social life and if she continues to try to isolate you from your friends, you may need to realize that you're in an abusive relationship."
747,I'm just worried that he knows where you stay now.. does your building have security?
748,Another reason we need feminism! It's not cool either way.
749,"&gt;This is the first time I’ve seriously thought about leaving him

Why? Not why are you thinking about leaving him, but why is it the first time you've seriously thought about this?

I mean, he didn't even get two tickets. So not only is he fine screwing you financially, he doesn't even consider you when it comes to doing the ""fun"" part."
750,"Gonna be a little blunt here, sorry. I can't tell if you're asking for advice with handling this situation, or trying to get us to tell you it was OK because you liked the attention. If it's the former, I'm sorry for sounding judgemental, but if it's the latter, then you already know it was pretty wrong. "
751,"Having something stolen from your home breaks your sense of comfort and security. Paranoia is super common for people who are victim to theft like this. You obsess over who could have done it and who could have had access to it. She's in a panic right now and will give a closer look to anything, not only does she want to know who did it but she's MUCH more desperate to get the necklace back. She has a list in her head of potential suspects, you are on the list because you had access to it whether you knew of its existence or not, regardless of your love for her and respect for her property. Her asking her son to take a look is an act of desperation to get her necklace back first and find out who did it second because in the end the necklace is her only priority here. She was hoping to keep it hush hush because she is not only giving you the benefit of the doubt, but she likes you, which is why she didn't want you to know that you are on her list of suspects. Your boyfriend telling you about this didn't really do anybody any good, regardless of his intentions. So don't take this personally, she's just short on people to trust right now. It absolutely sucks having shit stolen from your home."
752,If you are a kid in a world where adults make all the decisions for you without the benefit of a parent to protect you I think you learn manipulation to divide and conquer to reduce the threat along with never being honest / vulnerable in case people use it against you. I genuinely think it was her survival strategy but she now needs to learn new skills for how to live in a loving family (which you obviously are). If she makes no effort to change then you have to be prepared to see it was her choice and let her go.

The ""do you want to go to Hell"" thing tells me this isn't really about a pigeon- is she religious? Did she want to go to church? Are you okay with her not being religious? Using Hell as a threat to try to win an argument works exactly 0% of the time, and it's why so many people hate Christians."

What's to stop you drafting a financial plan for having a child and then showing it to him. Draw up some figures for how you think it will work moneywise. Are you planning to be a SAHM for a couple of years? Work part-time? How much is childcare where you are? What are your outgoings on rent/mortgage etc?

Remind him that at 30 you're running out of time somewhat and that you need to start trying for a child NOW. You should say to him that you're beginning believe he isn't committed to the idea of parenthood and that if he doesn't want kids he should just be honest and tell you. "
758,"A small compliment at that! I think it's important to acknowledge that while it read to her as negative, what he said was NOT insulting and he shouldn't be beating himself up for trying to make her feel beautiful. Nothing he says is going to work if her self-esteem is that far in the gutter, he is in a no-win situation until her own self-image improves."

And while I was waiting for the Badass of New York to land, some random people were asking about my ""Welcome Home, BAMF!"" sign, and I got them to cheer for you, too. By the time you made it down to get your bags, there was a small group of musicians playing, a huge crowd of people hooting and hollering, someone was selling ""NY BAMF"" t-shirts, someone else started selling hot dogs. The local news even showed up. 

Unbelievable that you turned right around. Literally unbelievable is his condom story. FFS, that is stupid.

I was a breach man in a spearhead unit, do you really think kids should be hearing my stories?"
763,"&gt; He says men don't respect an effeminate man's relationship with a girl, so they will still hit on me.

This likely is just indicative that he himself doesn't respect effeminate men. His idea of respecting men is built around masculinity.

This is also why he's not threatened by you relationship with your gay friend. If your friend was to appear more masculine, your boyfriend would begin to feel threatened by him and would ask you to dial back on that relationship.

Here is your sign. If you don't even want to spend a holiday with your SO, what makes you think that spending *every* day and holiday together as husband and wife would be a good time?

All of his positive qualities make no difference. He could be romance novel perfect, and still not be person you want to spend the rest of your life with. That's okay."
766,"Bluntly, 8 months isn't long enough to give a full understanding of someone's character. And plenty of abusers ramp up their abuse slowly over time, as their partners get more and more entrenched in the relationship. Some even (rarely) are all sweetness and light until they move in together, or get married, or even have kids. Obviously none of us can live our lives in fear of a switch flipping, but we can at least keep an eye out for red flags, or potential red flags, and this is a massive one.

Why do you believe he has changed? I'd say don't just confront him, you need to have a serious, in depth, *long* conversation about this. Exactly how he treated women in his past, why, what's changed, why you should believe he's changed, etc. I can't help but think he'll either try and gloss over it, or get mad you're bringing it up, or similar. Anything short of a detailed, 100% honest outpouring of his history should send you running for the hills.

But honestly, if you do believe these stories I'd reconsider things regardless. Because sure, people change over time, they might have a temper and tone it down, become more/less social, etc., but people who are violently physically abusive don't just decide one day ""I'll do better"" and stick to it. Because that aspect of themselves hasn't gone anywhere, the attitude and mindset that made them think it was OK is still there, they've just got better at hiding it."

768,"I think you need to pump the brakes here. 

She is a roommate, someone that was forced through circumstances beyond her control to be living there. 

She didnt pick you, you were randomly assigned.

You got super lucky if this is your only complaint, some people can make your life hell. 

She isnt being rude and inconsiderate. This is a business arrangement that you have. Its not personal.

I think you need to get over it and respect the fact that she isn't trying to be your bestie. Its difficult enough being in a strange place. You need to find your friendships elsewhere.   I have never liked being that close to roommates because it seems they never give you any privacy. I cant have someone over, eat waffles for breakfast, or just lay in bed and play xbox without having to discuss it or feel pressured to entertain them. 

You need a hobby and *other* friends. If you are in a city, download that pokemon game and get out there and meet some new people. There are tons of apps you can use to find others with similar interests. If language is a barrier, they have lots of apps for that now. It will help you learn the language which isnt hard when you are immersed in it. If you are in a foreign place with time on your hand then get out and explore. Even my little backwoods town has cool restaurants and museums. Maybe there is a super cool event a short distance away and you are missing out because you are moping that R doesn't want to be your bestest buddy. You dont need her and her alone and she doesnt owe you anything beyond picking up after herself. 

 I dont want to be too harsh, but you sound like you are in a city with thousands of people and you are crying because one person doesn't want to hang out. There are more people. Go find them. "

I say future relationships because you should dump this scumbag.  He's cheap garbage person.  If he has a problem with tipping, he shouldn't eat a restaurants where servers rely on them for their wages.  And that he's haranguing you about $4 shows the kind of person that he is.

He's not going to get better.  I'd be willing to bet there's other red flags in this relationship that you haven't mentioned that would further exemplify his garbagehood.  He's going to continue to be garbage going forward.  The best course of action for you is to move on from this guy and find someone else."
776,"&gt; This does seem like a potential huge incompatibility

This! Putting aside whether it's right or wrong to care about what others think, showing off material wealth, it definitely sounds like you guys have drastically different views on how money should be spent. I think this problem only gets bigger with time.

Yes! Controlling behavior is unacceptable to me."
777,"Let me bluntly explain this story to you from an outside perspective:

He brings you to a party with all of his closest friends who he doesn't get to see in that group setting very often and is really excited to see. Then *you* proceed to drink so much to the point of getting incredibly sick, forcing him to leave the party and tend to you. Once he gets you home safe, he asks the completely reasonable question of if it's ok for him to go back to enjoy more time with his friends, and you get mad at him. He does end up staying, but you are still mad at him.

You are 100% in the wrong. You ruined this for him. You have no right to be mad at him, he was trying to see his friends and your behavior blew it.

You can make all the excuses you want about other people putting more alcohol in your drink, but you are an adult. You need to be able to control your drinking and be aware of your drinks and limits.

Honestly he has every right to be mad at you and you have none.

I'm guessing he is going to think twice about bringing you to another party with this group. And honestly, he would be justified."
778,you spend the entire first part of your post obsessing about this woman. how she’s so beautiful and has the best personality and that you think she’s always wanted more from you. not surprising your wife is not comfortable and would not be comfortable with the idea of the business. is jane even a savvy business person? if this is a legit business venture you should talk to your wife. if jane is starting a business soley bc she has come into money and is bringing you in just to be closer to you i would turn it down. 
779,"In addition to this, your brother should not be afraid to be honest in grad school interviews about his struggles in college and with addiction, because they will likely ask him about it if he gets offered an interview.  In undergrad, I also struggled to remain focused academically due to some family financial issues, resulting in a spotty transcript and less than stellar GPA.  I also wasn't even thinking that I would ever pursue a graduate degree.  I ended up working in the field for 4 years after graduation before deciding I wanted to pursue my Masters.  I was honest about all of it in the graduate school interview and the interviewing faculty respected my ""real world"" experience and willingness to be upfront about my lack of focus and maturity. "

786,"&gt;They constantly belittle my choice, calling teaching a useless career.

Amazingly stupid. Who do they think helped them to become lawyers and doctors and surgeons? Pretty sure they didn't self-teach themselves those vocations.

Your family sounds like they have some real hang-ups surrounding class and needing to be seen as wealthy/influential/important. By becoming ""just"" a teacher you're threatening their image of themselves as an elite.

I would work on setting boundaries by ending conversations when they belittle you: hanging up the phone, physically getting up and leaving, and reducing contact with them until they learn that you won't tolerate their ridicule. Be very clear about why you're doing it: ""I'm not interested in talking to you until you can have a conversation without belittling my career choices. You let me know when you're ready to do that.""

Don't let them get you down, OP. You're doing important work that makes you happy and that matters way more than your family's insecurities."
787,"Postpartum is a hard enough stage as it is for a new mother to go through, let alone a mom with TWO young kids, particularly one who (it sounds like, based on your description) gets no break from being mommy and wife to just be herself for an hour without anyone touching her or depending on her or needing affection from her.

Her body has changed a TON in hundreds of little tiny ways within less than 5 years, ways that she’s likely been aware of with a laser focus. This world is hell for women when it comes to our bodies, and a woman who’s just average sized - but still *skinny* - and not even plus-sized will sometimes be treated as “fat”, just for not being a waif.

It sounds like she places a lot of value on her body being tiny and thin, and like she worked a lot to keep it that way - until kids came along, and what energy and time she had for exercising/dieting had to be given up for mom duties. 

Sit down with her and tell her you’re so sorry for hurting her with your carelessness.... but you’re worried by her reaction and the way she talks about herself and her body. Tell her you love her, that you’re there for her in any and every way. 

Ask her not what to do to fix this, but *how* she’s feeling, what’s she feeling, and then genuinely *listen*. Don’t try to interrupt her and tell her how beautiful and sexy she is if she says that she thinks she’s ugly and fat, and don’t try to give her solutions for any of these issues. Sit, listen, and ask about how she feels when you want a makeout session the second you get home, or what the best parts of her day were along with the worst. 

To be able to help her, you need to be able to understand everything that’s affecting her, inside and out; and to do that, you need to be able to listen and take in all that she says without thinking about how her struggle with herself and her body affects you."
788,"This is all really, really shitty of him. But the milk has been spilled, and all that's left to do is pick yourself up and move on. As part of that, you're obviously needing to do some absorption of the shock of this situation and also some processing. So let's do that.

&gt; I’m too humiliated to talk to anyone I know    
&gt;  
&gt;I can’t even think about breaking this to my parents.   
&gt;  
&gt;his sister is my best friend. I want to tell her but I’m so afraid to 

*You* have nothing to be ashamed of - you've done nothing wrong. He, on the other hand, *does*. He has cheated on you, defiled your trust and decade-long relationship, and used you for your cash and love until he struck some fortune and could move on to someone else. This is quintessential ""user"" behavior, and that's indicative of a serious problem with him, not you. Likewise, the people in your life - your parents, friends, coworkers, and friend/his sister - are all going to see this situation for what it is too. Right now, you are at a low point and need support, and these people are going to empathize with you and support you. So get on the phone RIGHT NOW and call your parents and his sister. I'm dead serious.  You need and deserve them now.

&gt; he said he was in love with...His friend’s little sister. Who is 23.   
&gt;  
&gt;They haven’t slept together but he’s in love with her? 

I have to call bullshit when I see it, and he's totally lying about not having had sex with her. Of course he has. It's probably been going on for a while now.

&gt; Now I’m middle-aged. With nothing. How am I supposed to start over? 

This is the trauma talking, not the truth. You have a career, you have family and friends, you have some money saved, and you seemingly have your health. Yes, this sucks, but your life isn't over. There are people who have been in similar situations, and though it was difficult, they picked up and moved on with their lives. And you can do that too.

So, how are you going to do that? To start, you need to gather your support network right now. Call your parents and friends, even if one of those friends is his sister. I'd wish you luck, but you don't need it. You can do this, and he's a fucking asshole not worth crying over."
789,"This right here.   Keep the evidence, frankly mail it to yourself so he doesn’t delete it.   Then confront him.

Edit:  saw your edits.   I’m sorry you are going through this.   Since you are asking for advice, may I make a suggestion?   He needs to really work to earn your trust and your mind is going to wander now especially if he’s in that work environment.   Is it possible for him to leave that job?   Serious trust breaches demand serious work.   Obviously you need to do what is best for you and your baby, whatever your choice is.   You are handling this beautifully btw.  "
790,"So he was 21 and you were 16 when y’all started dating? And you got married after knowing each other for less than a year? I’m just trying to figure out this timeline of events. 

If you both want your marriage to work, you need counseling ASAP. His dreams are just his massive guilt. I am Christian also, and there’s no reason he couldn’t remarry almost 5 years after his first marriage. Also, the ex wife in his dreams will always be who she was at 17. He dreams of her pushing you into traffic because that’s something a jealous 17 year old would imagine doing. He has maaaajor issues to work on, and honestly, you probably do as well if you were fine with getting married at 17 years old to someone you’d only dated a year or less. 

How long has he had these dreams? What does he want from you? "
791,"I recommend Bob the builder, teletubbies theme tune or daddy shark mummy shark song "
792,"&gt;Is it better to cut my losses rather than expect him to make the giant change that I would need?

Have you asked him? Your situation is killing you, and you need him to be with you, contributing more. If he knows that and isn't changing anything, he is making it clear the he doesn't care about your marriage or your wellbeing to quit. If he *doesn't* know that, you can't blame him for those things until you tell him.

Doesn't your husband *know* how you feel, and how much you want him to come back? Did you tell him honestly that you are at breaking point, that you need him to change job, and that his course choices made you hurt and angry? "
793,"Please take this to heart op... I grew up watching my dad be angry and gaslight my mom. And most importantly, I watched her do nothing back. I learned that standing up for yourself is worse than being abused.

Guess what, I stayed with someone abusive for two years because I didn’t feel like standing up for myself in a relationship was okay to do. I was susceptible to gaslighting and always blamed myself for everything he did to me. I felt *guilty* when I’d get angry when he would cuss me out or hurt me.

You can seriously destroy your daughter’s perception of what she deserves and how people are allowed to treat her. Also Op eventually he will treat your daughter like garbage as well, and gaslight her. Maybe he will even turn her against you by saying you are paranoid and mean to him. :/

It’s so bad for daughters and sons to stay under the house of abusive parents. They are sponges. You can create someone who knows to break up when they’re being treated wrongly. Or you can create someone who is taught to ignore their own feelings and endure abuse no matter how bad it is. Or you can teach them to be abusive, lie, and gaslight others... it’s not okay to teach a child to do these things."
794,"Thank you.  Yes, I have my savings in a personal account that he has no access to.  I also cancelled the card so he can't get a hold of it.  I can still access the money by transferring it to another account.  Which is helpful because he ask if I had any cash and I just took a screenshot of the empty account.  Which is helpful because he thinks I'm stuck and isn't going super crazy.

795,Ideal situation vs actual situation. Kids often are put in shitty situations and have to deal with a load of bs from their parents. Ideally the kid should have a key. But if they don’t even know where they’re spending the night it makes it 10x harder
796,"It is a real thing. Poking holes in condoms, messing with pills. Whether he did or not, it's your choice, and the fact that he's ecstatic about something making you miserable, and is making you miserable about it, is more than grounds enough to break up. 

Whatever you do about the pregnancy, sounds like you should break up with this guy. He's not paying his share of your expenses, he's clearly not going to do his fair share of raising a kid, he's harassing you, calling you a cheater, making you feel horrible, and doing nothing to help you. He's not your boyfriend, he's an asshole you live with.

And, if you decide to abort, maybe lie about having a miscarriage - not because there's anything wrong with having an abortion, but to avoid backlash from your family when your ex outs you."
797,"Yeah, there comes a point at which you are not doing yourself, your partner, or your marriage any favors by pretending you are not livid with them.

Days-old, obvious cat vomit would be one of those points at which anger needs to be expressed. I'm not advising OP to scream or throw things, but a clear, direct ""I'm furious with you and disgusted with your choices."" would be perfectly fair and honest communication."

No, you're just recognizing that he's not for you. It's okay that someone is just not for you - especially since you've already told him to chill and he hasn't like cooled his jets."
803,"Yes. This.

Also, OP said he paraphrased, I wonder did he really say ""looks bad"", like... If he said ""she looks weird"" that doesn't mean ugly - it means ""not conventionally attractive"", I'm wondering if OP meant it in a way that was like ""I know she's a weirdo, but she's *my* weirdo""."
804,"Hi.  US lawyer here.  Here are some suggestions:

* Do **not** sign the birth certificate unless/until the child has been DNA test and the DNA matches yours.  In most US states, the law automatically presumes you to be the father if you are married to a woman who gives birth.  This is true regardless of whether or not the child is biologically yours.  This means that the law will impose upon you all the rights and responsibilities of a father (things like child support, etc...). The only way to beat this is with a court order after you demonstrate that the child is not your biological child.  If the DNA test shows the child isn't yours, **immediately** hire a lawyer to challenge paternity.  In many US states, you have a limited time to challenge paternity.  If you don't challenge paternity in that window, you forever lose the right to do so.  If you miss that window, it doesn't matter if Jesus Christ himself signs an affidavit swearing you aren't the father; the law will, for all purposes, treat you as the child's father.  Therefore, it is essential that you act quickly.

*  Don't feel obligated to stay with your wife, even if the child is yours.  Your trust in her is shattered.  A baby doesn't fix that.  It is better for the child to have two loving adults who are separated from each other than two adults who live together but have a broken marriage.

* I would suggest tomorrow that you open the phone book and call a couple lawyers in your town that specialize in family law matters.  Explain your situation and ask for a consultation (which is typically free or cheap).  You need to have a good understanding of what your options are regarding legal separation, divorce, child support, paternity testing, etc....  Don't think that you can/should do this alone.  Lawyers are trained professionals who will look out for your best interests, which is something that your wife hasn't done.  At the very least, meet with a lawyer so that you have a good understanding of your options going forward.

* In terms of whether or not to leave your wife, you don't have to decide that right now.  You can let your head clear a bit and make that decision at some point down the road.  I'd suggest first meeting with a lawyer, learning your options and the pros/cons of such options, and then taking some time to decide."
805,"Do you want your daughter to grow up seeing her mother treated so incredible disrespectfully by her father? 

It's clear that he is going to keep cheating on you. Can you live your life married to him, knowing that he will never stop and will also be spending significant portions of money on other women?

Couples can certainly move on from infidelity. But not if the cheater feels no sense of remorse, is manipulative, and clearly values their own wants over the marriage.

I'm not sure what country you are in, but do you have legal protection where you live, if you were to divorce him? Ie. would he have to support his daughter financially? 

And do you have a job? And a support network in the area? Ie. friends or family you could stay with for a time, to help out with childcare. etc.

Edit: He became ""physical"" with you after confronting him with his cheating. So he is both emotionally and physically abusive. He has given himself full permission to do anything he wants and to do anything to you if you try to stop him. You deserve better and your daughter deserves better. "
806,Just stay firm. You're an adult and allowed to change your name if you don't like your given name. A lot of people do this for a number of reasons.

808,"Your unhappy in your marraige, and you are interested in another woman. So these are 2 separate issues, but your trying to use one to justify the other.

My advice is this. Ignore this other woman for a moment, and think about your marraige, and if you want to continue on with it. If this co-worker of yours was not in the picture, would you still want to work on fixing things with your wife?

If you decide to end your marraige, it has to be for you. Not this other woman, or any chance you may have with her. You have to accept you may end up alone after a divorce. 

Do not cheat on your wife, it's wrong, and never worth it. Just decide if you want to stay married or not, and go from there. Also, if the answer is that you DO want to work on your marraige, you need to break your friendship off with your co-worker. This is very low grade emotional cheating at best, what's going on between the two of you "
809,"I would be exhausted too!

Sounds like you are hanging out with a bunch of assholes who think that their farts don't stink.  I think their behavior more than warrants a conversation with your GF.  Not to get her to change their behavior, but to get her to see your side of things and support you when the jerks are being jerks to you.

Most importantly, remember that these people are not as ""good"" as they would like you to believe.  They talk big about easing human suffering and then inflict it on someone personally.  They are just bullies who are taking a new angle on it."

811,"This seems like an appropriate time to use your company's Emergency Assistance Plan or take FMLA and get your family in to counselling. You can also consult with the police about how to manage his threats. You need professional help with this. I imagine at 17 he has an adult man's body and could inflict serious damage on you, your spouse, or your home. Any threats of violence should be met with a call to the police. You need to be treating this like an emergency. Absolutely cut the internet connection to your home. Sit in his room with him and read to him if you have to. "
812,Your girlfriend sounds like a spoiled child who needs a reality check. You really need to stand up for yourself and stop letting her walk all over you. 
813,"I also watch too many romantic comedies, but this sounds exactly like one. I'd bet anything that after the boyfriend drunkenly made out with his roommate the first night, they had a conversation about how it's a bad idea for roommates to date. So now they're in a situation where they clearly have feelings for each other, but have agreed not to cross the line. But... they also know they won't be living together forever. OP is the girlfriend in the romantic comedy that the main guy dates to take his mind off the main girl, which clearly isn't working. She'll eventually cause both of them to realize they really care about each other. I wouldn't be surprised if the boyfriend and the roommate start dating when their lease is up."
814,"Whatever you do, check your phone records. Find out if he is reaching out to her for comfort while you are in that hotel with your daughter and unborn child. That will tell you what you need to know about whether your husband really wants a future with you or not. That will tell you whether you can trust him or not. "
815,"People that make these posts are often constantly told they are overreacting and dramatic etc. 

Their common sense is failing them because they've been low-key gas-lit into believing it isn't as much of a problem as they think.

It's good that these things are straight forward and common sense to you, that puts you in the right position to help these people out."
816,"I’m concerned not just about this particular issue (which is definitely a red flag), but about the entire last paragraphs of your post. You may want to google “emotional labor in relationships” because it sounds like you’re about to sign up to do all of it for the rest of your married life. Why can’t your boyfriend remember to do simple adult tasks on his own? Unless he has some kind of diagnosis/is working very hard to manage his “absent mindedness”, I’d be very wary of signing up for a lifetime of being the only grownup in the house. "
817,"He could have a real Madonna/Whore complex going on when it comes to women. Your having been a virgin when started dating only reinforces that. It's not a particularly healthy view to have, but it isn't uncommon, particularly with people raised in religious households. I'd suggest couples therapy to try and explore it further."
818,"I don’t think the comment you made is terrible, but seeing how you described her as petite/skinny before her pregnancies could have a toll on her. Her body is changing in ways she may not like. Instead of saying “no you’re not fat” I would just apologize for the comment you made and tell her you understand how that could have hurt her feelings. I would sit down with her and if she’s comfortable, ask her to share her insecurities with you if she hasn’t already and what you can do as a partner to help her. If she is deeply insecure, she is ultimately the only person who can fix those issues but as partner you can be supportive in ways like avoiding making comments about her curves or like encouraging and exhibiting healthy habits like exercise and a balanced diet. Many women’s body change during pregnancies and there’s nothing to be ashamed about, but she may just have a hard time dealing with it since she is used to seeing herself as petite. "
819,Screenshot the Instagram post first! And the DMs!
820,"Yeah - if OPs daughter is trying to make it work, parents should put a brave face on and at least be cordial. I think they could say “I’m very disappointed in husband, but if you’re trying to forgive and reconcile, we support you.” 

When he cheats again, daughter will still feel safe coming to parents for help. "

824,"""The relationship is not working for me, so we need to stop seeing each other.""

You don't owe anyone any more than that.  

The more you say beyond that, the more angles you will give him to try to change your mind.  If you mention the drugs and alcohol, he'll have the opportunity to say ""if I quit, will you stay?"" and if you say no, he can accuse you of being heartless, and if you say *yes*, he can just put on a show of ""trying"" so you'll stay, and then when he backslides, he can accuse you of being heartless because he ""really tried hard"" and you left him anyway.

So don't let him rope you into that game.  You don't *owe* him a relationship.

It's not working for you, it's over, and that's all he needs to know.

Then break off contact with him."
825,"We keep a lot of our things separate, but on the occasion where we split or otherwise share something, the events tend to unfold where I prioritize getting something we both like and he prioritizes getting the most economical version that he can tolerate.

There's been several conversations along the lines of ""Hey, when I offered to get pizza, I took you to that Chicago Style pizza joint you were dying to try. When you offered pizza to me, we got Hot n' Ready Little Caesar's that you know I don't like when I'm sober. Why?"" *And yes, I realize not every time is going to be a special time, but we're the type of people who go out to eat or order food* ***maybe*** ***5-6 times a year****, so I do notices when half the time we eat out are versions of things I do not like.*

He seems to be uncomfortable when I mention it, which produces various responses (not using the item, replacing it equally 1-2 times then going back to the most economical option, no change, ect ect)."

827,"“I am not interested in joining your business venture, &amp; I do not want to discuss it further. I am extremely disappointed that someone I considered to be a good friend would choose to harass me - as well as to contact other people I know to try to reach me - to try to change my mind. Even if I had been interested initially, I would never choose to go into business with someone that uses those sort of tactics. If you contact me (or anyone I know asking them to contact me for you) again, I will block you &amp; pursue legal avenues.”

Don’t go to dinner with the guy. That just reinforces that if he harassed you enough, he gets your attention. "
828,"She did and as I understand it she kept getting contradictory answers from her family as to where she was supposed to be and who would actually be home. To my husband, it was either be the one to give her a ride or leave her in the middle of nowhere as she tried to figure out who would pick her up. "
829,And she graduated high school 12 years ago. That's a decade worth of life experience between the two of you.
830,"I've been shooting for ten years now. Your points are completely reasonable and correct. They are absolutely, 100% in the wrong for doing what they did. It's beyond stupid that they went on to try to make you out to be the bad guy. Their behavior would be grounds for being thrown out of every gun range I've ever been to:

* **Never** handle firearms under the influence. Drinking is fine. Shooting is fine. Handling guns while drunk is not fine.

* **Never** aim your gun at something you don't intend to destroy.

* **Never** pull the trigger on a firearm you haven't 100% verified is empty.

That last point is something that sounds like they're arguing with you about and I still think they're in the wrong. I've dry fired (aka pulled the trigger on an unloaded gun) before, primarily to check the action after cleaning. What I **never** do though is dry fire on a gun I haven't verified to be completely empty. 

I always unload the mag then look down the ejection port to make sure it's unloaded. I have to see daylight through the empty magwell. I then stick my finger all over the chamber, including the barrel breech, to verify that it's unloaded though touch as well as sight. Out of habit I also rack the slide several times as a third precautionary measure before actually dry firing. 

Possibly overkill, but preferable to a negligent discharge. Dry firing a firearm someone handed you that you haven't verified is empty is simply stupid, full stop. 

Your boyfriend is stupid, your boyfriend's friends are stupid, and none of them have any business being around guns. Mishandling firearms is not something you go ""Sorry, I fucked up"" over. ""I'm sorry"" doesn't mean shit when someone has a bullet in them. Mishandling firearms is something you never do. I'm perfectly comfortable around firearms and I absolutely will never date someone who is willing to keep company like that around, has that level of negligence with firearms, and refuses to listen when I tell them that they're being stupid. My personal opinion is if they're pissed off you ""ruined their hang"", they're more than free to hang out this way so long as they're farther than the maximum range of whatever they're going to inevitably shoot each other with.

Finally, there's nothing wrong with you not feeling comfortable with guns. Them feeling (wrongly) comfortable around them does not mean you or anyone else is obligated to feel the same way. You never bring guns into someone else's home without asking their permission first and you certainly never force them onto someone who doesn't want them. This is beyond gun etiquette - this is just being an asshole. They are not entitled to dictate your comfort levels around guns regardless of whether it's in your own home or anywhere else."

832,"A good doctor will never tell you any diagnosis for sure until they run some tests. This is normal. 

Just because she said she isn't sure, doesn't mean it's not migraines.

833,"Yeah, the first part of the story made him sound like a cowardly mama's boy, but the last bit just made him sound like a shit. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life like this? A good relationship doesn't make you feel bad. You bring up your concerns to your husband and rather than addressing them with you, he throws a tantrum and threatens to get deployed. An adult human being who loves you wouldn't do that. "
834,"I definitely second that assessment. But if you ever feel like you are stuck in a rut, maybe pick up a creative hobby? Or a language skill? Something that adds to your character?"

There's still a very good chance that this business will fail, or at least, not provide enough income to support himself. But whether or not he becomes financially successful, he's still a louse.

Yep. I work with a bank and we have a lot of business account holders. Most startups don't make it. And if the ones that do make it can take years to really make a profit.  "

841,"Ahh he went the nuclear route. Interesting for someone who seems to intent on bringing peace to the family. 

Therapy and talk to who ever about it, but not your sister. She needs your love and support. If you really need to process this just go to a therapist. Do not contact him. This is not your fight and it would be massively inappropriate. He clearly doesn't want communication with you.

I've been in your shoes. Try not to take it personally. He just wants his old life gone and to move on and to do that sometimes people to a little overboard and burn bridges with innocent bystanders. You just have to realize they are struggling and give them the space to find themselves again."
842,"&gt;I am genuinely baffled as to WHY she keeps doing this. She is not lacking in finances, she seems like a completely normal person in every other way, it's just this one issue that has me stumped.

My guess is compulsive eating or disordered eating. Some people literally cannot control themselves.

As for how to fight it, I would get a fabric lunchbox and use a 3 digit luggage lock ~~some~~ ~~zip ties to seal it: it means you'll have to cut zip ties off your lunch every day~~ , but it might also dissuade her from trying to eat it.

EDIT: /u/mistermetal had a better idea! \\m/, &gt;.&lt; ,\\m/"
843,"When I was 22, I also dated a 29 year old who pursued me, told me he loved me pretty quickly, and he was the first love of my life.

And, he admitted to me several months in that he was still in love with his ex-wife who had left him for someone else, but he still cared for me, too.

I was young, super in love, and thought maybe I just needed to give him time to work through it.  I told him so, including that I really wasn't happy to hear it and expected him to work on it, since he was in therapy. He did precisely squat to get over it, and we broke up several months later.

So take it from someone who is over a lifetime away from that love - this relationship is over.  It hurts, it's not fair to you, but this relationship is done.  You can just add yourself to his list of great women who got away, because once you move on and stop giving him love and support and comfort, he may get angry at first, but then, he's gonna try and win you back.

However, the trust between you is pretty ~~will~~ well broken now, and there is no bringing it back.  Your BF needs to work through his shit, and stop looking for manic pixie dream girls."

849,"I mean, I very simply wouldn't date him for doing these things, just because **I don't want to.** You don't need to submit some kind of proof to a jury on why it's right or wrong. I just don't WANT this in my relationship. Just like I don't want to be with someone that smokes cigars or has no sense of humor. I don't have to prove there's anything WRONG with those things, I just simply don't want to be in a relationship where they are there.

And, I would not want to be in a relationship with a guy who has this kind of relationship going on. I would find it annoying, awkward, and just repellent and a waste of my time. I just wouldn't WANT it. Don't want it in my life, don't want to put up with it. So I would move on and find someone else. How many billions of men are there on the Earth again?"

Remember, you didn’t cause it, you can’t cure it, and you can’t control it. 

If he ends up late for work, that’s HIS problem to deal with. Let him suffer the consequences. If he tries to drive drunk, call the police and get him taken off the road, but otherwise let him dig his own hole, and hopefully when he gets in too deep he will stop digging and get help.

859,"Your vagina is YOUR vagina. Masturbation is personal self gratification and he has no place to tell you how, when, or what to pleasure yourself with. He needs to understand that masturbation is between you yourself and your own body, and that he has nothing to do with this. It has nothing to do with your desire for him, it has to do with your desire for yourself. He gets no say in this, and you should confirm ""Yes, we are just going by what I decide. It's my body, and it's my choice, and I won't let you shame me any longer with your projection, insecurity, and dildo envy.""

He sounds extremely controlling. I would even guess that he's so insecure, given his history of questioning you and making you feel bad for your sexual history, that he is trying to track down old sexual timelines of yours to control you. Frankly, your sexual history is none of his business and doesnt define you, and if it defines you in his eyes, he really doesnt care about you, he cares about an idealized perception of you that hes holding on a pedestal. You're a human being who had sexual needs and urges before he came along, and hes just going to have to deal with that. If he refuses to drop it, tell him its damaging your relationship, and consider dropping him.

You need to make a promise to yourself. And make this promise in front of him. That you will pleasure yourself however you damn please with whatever toys you want, and that if hes not comfortable with your sexuality, that's his problem. 
Why did he ask about the dildo usage 3 times? Why? You have to admit, this can't sit right in your head. You said twice you only used it once... so how did he know to keep going? He may have a camera set up in your shared living space, a huge violation of your privacy, or knows how to access your laptops webcam.

871,"Personally, I would start being mean about it, but give her fair warning first. When I passed along an original idea or discussed a new plan with her, I'd follow it up with ""Hey, try not to steal it, ok?"" every single time. Basically, keep it sort of jokey, but definitely call out the behavior.

If she kept her antics up, I'd then start feeding her bullshit ideas and then immediately writing them down, word for word, and dating it.

1) She hid all this behavior from you

2) Even when confronted with it, she cycled through fleeing, anger and hysterics before (regretfully) cancelling

3) She prepped for it.  Nails, hair, lashes.  Plenty of premeditation.

4) She tried a weak-ass lie about not knowing it was a hotel.  

5) She lied about the paramour being an ex of hers FFS.

I know this is hard, and you are going through some tough emotions - being severely disrespected is humiliating - but you need to understand something; you now have insight into your GF's core values and level of integrity.

You \*know\* this now.  You cannot unknow this.  From (painful) experience, I can tell you that the chance of her repeating this (but more carefully) in the future is very, very high.  Not 100%, people can learn and change, but her reactions upon being caught put the odds damn close to 100%.

You have to decide if this girl is worth swallowing your pride and self-respect, and then living with that nagging sense of betrayal every time she gets a text for the rest of time."
874,"I think more than an eating disorder, she has a control issue. She got really into figure competitions and stuff after that and food/working out was a way for her to control things after she went through something traumatic in her 20s. She was 6 months old when her dad died and it still affects her, so you might be right about it being a coping method beyond just her 20s. I never thought about that, thank you.

Luckily I've gotten over the nightly binges and generally don't worry about calories because I know the harm that brings me. I appreciate the advice and will try some of it out while I'm there!

879,He won't get a vasectomy because he's holding out hope that we'll have another kid.
880,"&gt;But to be a good friend he needs more awareness of the power dynamics at play

Exactly. A 35 year old can be friends with a 16 year old, but the friendship absolutely needs to be more mentor/student type friendship, rather than buddy-buddy. It is super easy to influence a teenager, especially if they trust you as a friend. And honestly, having been a 16 year old girl once upon a time.....it would be very easy for her to develop inappropriate feelings. A handsome older guy who not only has mutual hobbies, but shows friendly interest on a personal level? That can take it from ""friend"" territory to ""crush"" territory super quickly. Teenagers aren't exactly known for their good judgement, and fall in ""love"" pretty quickly (at least in the case of me, my friends, and most other teenagers I knew) with people who show you a lot of positive attention. If she starts talking about the guy she has a crush on, and her family finds out it's OP's husband......it isn't going to be a big stretch for them to imagine he's grooming her. Even though he isn't, it isn't the norm for well established adults to hang out and be friends with teenagers. 

I don't think OP's husband behaved inappropriately at all, but unfortunately a LOT of people would look at a 35 year old man spending time alone with a 16 year old girl and think he was being creepy. Especially if they knew he was helping her out after a breakup, while her feelings are a mess.

All the boundaries you listed are extremely good ones for keeping everything on the up and up.

881,"And when you call him out on this, what happens? He puts the pillow over his head, you remove it and say ""nope, your turn"". When he says he's going to change, you say ""Great, take the baby with you"" **and make him take the baby with him.** Or you call up / go up to him after 5 minutes and give him the baby then.

What confuses me is, why are you putting up with this? If I was this guy my wife would be reading me the riot act and rightly so. Flat out say to him ""your sense of time is bad, when you say you'll be 2 minutes and take an hour, a) that's unacceptable, I refuse to do 90% of the parenting, and b) what the hell are you doing all that time?"" Demand an answer! And I second just handing over the baby and going out to catch a movie - he's 50% responsible for parenting when he's not working, that's the deal. "

&gt; 
&gt; 

Yeah, I was coming here to say ""This is solid 'pitch a fit' territory."" OP clearly feels she has to treat her husband very delicately, but that's also clearly not working. She's pregnant and spent a massively stressful month taking care of others and came home to cat puke everywhere? It's time to get mad. Being delicate and treating her husband with kid gloves isn't going to make him understand that she means what she said or do anything about it, because he knows he can get away with not doing it and still be treated delicately."
883,"He's not sorry. He's sorry he was caught. He admitted he would never confess. He's using joint money, risking STDs and even if he said it was no sex, and let's assume he's serious  here.

887,The world needs more men like you and less men like your father. Please don't ever let him make you feel ashamed of who you are. 
888,"I appreciate the comment. I was afraid someone would say this but I also needed to hear it! Out of curiosity, what aspects of their relationship make you think its more than platonic? Is it mainly the amount of time they spend together that makes things weird?"
889,Your post history is disgusting
890,"Following up on this--your passwords need to be something your dad can't guess. First name of your paternal grandfather? Alligator. Mother's maiden name? Dog food. Birthday of your oldest sister? 67923. Stuff like this.

Seconding freezing your credit! You don't really need a credit card at your age unless you use it regularly. Also sign up for a free credit monitoring service--your bank can hope you with that (or check r/personalfinance)."
891,"**I** didn't know we were planning this. My friend took it upon herself, scheduled it around my birthday and basically called and hit me with the dates and all the info. Her exact words ""We have talked about this forever. Its go time, bitch""


I guess I should have told him before I started securing all the other stuff, but I was trying to basically make it like ""Hey, I'm going to do this, but while I'm gone I've taken care of everything for you so you don't have to do ANYTHING!"""
892,"Watch your mail just on the very tiny chance she tries to take you to small claims court.

If she does, show up to court. She will lose. But if she sues you and you don't show up, she might get a default judgment and then you would owe her the money. Don't spend a lot of time worrying about it though; the chance she would go through with this is tiny. "
893,"No offense OP but it does not sound like you are “happily” married at all.

Your husband is useless. Extremely useless. You are pretty much a single mom who is married - if that makes any sense.

I have no advice. Doesn’t seem like he is interested in changing his ways so... good luck."
894,"She needs to disclose to her doctor that she traveled to areas in costa Rica that may have had hookworms. This may not be a beauty issue, but a parasitic foot infection. Perhaps a sincere but direct conversation about parasites and a Google image search might help convince her."
895,"The answer is yes...she can carry her stuff around all day seeing as all the other undergrads do too. 

But seriously, he is dating her. I am so sorry, but it’s only a month in and I would cut your losses. "
896,"This is on you for not being honest with your bf and expecting him to read your mind. You could've told him ""no, I'm not comfortable with you going for X, Y and Z reasons"" and you didn't. Learn from this for the future to better learn to voice what you want in the relationship. "
897,"I am. and Franks family has made odd comments. Our child received a dark skinned baby doll for a birthday and MIL asked, ""Where'd you get that colored doll from?"" I wasn't around, Frank had told me about it as if it were funny, and I had to calm myself down before telling him, ""this ends with you."" "
898,"I had a co-worker who was on a schedule like this (6am-2pm) where everyone else in the company arrived around 9:30a/10 and worked until 6:30p/7. It did get a bit frustrating at times because when he would leave he wouldn't respond to any calls or e-mails (understandably) but often we needed to get things done in his department (he was the only one) and he just was nowhere to be found so we ended up having to figure it out on our own and essentially do his job for him. We eventually just took the entire position over for him. Doesn't sound like that's OPs attitude at all but I totally see how it can be frustrating for the other part of the team. They're not reacting in a mature way though, which really sucks."
899,He's acting like a man-child. He spent $1000 on a CONCERT ticket? Without consulting you first? And now you'll have to fix it and he really isn't all that concerned?  He doesn't get a B- -- that's a fail. I'd leave.
900,"This is why rushed military marriages crumble like a cookie. One or both is NOT ready to get married and extremely immature. He uses your dog as a prop to give the appearance of a 2.5 kids white picket fence etc happy household... and then you spend a paragraph detailing every way he sabotages the happiness.

Good thing about this is you can divorce and only be 21 and single!"
901,"You are in the right. Stand your ground.

You have a spare room! There's no reason for this fight to even happen! 

Tell them you're not discussing it again. Say that every time. EVERY time. "
902,"Yikes. Mental health is not a competition.

I'd honestly ditch him. A partner who feels superior to you is a red flag in my opinion."
903,"Yeah I've heard of it, but we still manage to be somewhat intimate when she has time. Every time she's pregnant her drive drops and I don't push it because I know pregnancy dramatically affects women in weird ways.

And some of it is my fault as well. My career (Doctor) requires a lot of my time and when I come home I just want to be with her and help with parenting the kids. I've been gone all day and it just seems wrong to walk in and ask for sex, or get her to have sex when she's been dealing with them all day. I appreciate what I can get right now with all the babies! She's enjoyed it more as time goes on, but she doesn't go crazy for it lol. There's barely any time honestly. 

"
904,"If OP starts at 7 and leaves at 3, amd his coworkers start at 9 amd leave at 5, then there is still a six hour window they are all at the office together. There is absolutely no reason to plan meetings outside those hours.

If their productivity is dependent on OP's presence, they have a personal problem.

OP, bring this to your boss and ask what ""we, as a company"" are going to do about it."
905,Ummmm..... Does he have cameras set up in his place? He seemed to already know the answer regarding this morning 
906,"&gt; He's either a catfish or an asshole

Or a human trafficker. 

I get queasy every time I see a post like OPs. ""Traveling a few thousand miles to stay with a stranger I met online!"" "
907,Well it doesn’t sound like he’s interested.  But I’m embarrassed for her and yes it’s concerning.
908,"He's a basket case. Dump him immediately. Oh, well not immediately. Have him retrieve the necklace first. 

Does he know it's value? Maybe he thought it was cheaper and pretty and you'd not miss it. But...at the same time, to not ask? That's absurd. "
909,Thinking the exact same thing. And if she's THAT worried that he won't be reasonable and listen to logic - why marry him?
910,This betrayal and break up is really fresh. You just have to give it time and be patient with yourself. Right now get active with friends and family for support and don't isolate yourself. 
911,"Alternatively, if it's financially viable, she and her daughter could stay at a really nice hotel with a spa and maybe try to turn  it into a nice  little staycation while she clears her head. Added bonus: he gets stuck with the chores and his shame. "

913,"&gt;Curiosity got the better of me and it is basically a two page hand written diatribe about all the ways he wants to have sex with her. It also describes in detail sexual activity and humiliation that he fantasizes about doing to me. This is bad enough but there are several places where in his letter he says things like ""you said in your last letter you want to see me walk your husband around on a dog leash with a bleeding a$$hole after I had my way with him. I'd love to see that b!tch cry as well."" There are several other instances where he starts things like ""in your last letter you said...""

Welp. I guess a violent criminal is now fantasizing about sexually assaulting you, thanks to your wife.

&gt;So having said that what can I do about this? Is this bad enough that it's separation category? I talked to my best friend (also a good friend of my wife's who is a female) and she said that to her it just sounded like ""masturbatory fantasy"" that I shouldn't get in the way of. To her its similar to me watching porn (which I don't really do) and just an escapism. 

Uh **NO**. This is not just ""porn"", porn is one person interacting with sexual media; this is ""cheating"", as it's TWO people interacting sexually *with each other*. And can I point out that some of it is ABOUT YOU!!! Yes, for me this would be separation-worthy, absolutely."
914,"You could just start refusing her requests. 

""OP, go get my stuff from the printer.""
""Sorry Becky, I can't, I'm busy right now.""

And if she gets mad or pushes back, you can explain that doing errands for her is not part of your job, and that your job duties take priority over her tasks. If you always refuse then she will stop asking. "
915,"man, i am so curious, i want to encourage you to be direct; ""you know that doesn't make any sense, what is really going on?"" but i think it's just way too out there a situation to yield honest, non-reactionary response to that kind of challenge. 

but also, ""oh, i don't lend money to friends, it always goes poorly"" is a good philosophy to have (or pretend to have) in general.

my guess is gambling or drugs. but regardless; protect yourself and your assets before you do ANYTHING about this/him again. change your passwords, don't bring cash/more than one card to your next get-together, don't assume he hasn't swiped through your phone/computer already."

917,"I would go to your boss but I wouldn't necessarily make it about their behavior towards you (which would be 100% ok to do) but I would frame it in a way that expresses concern for your productivity. Like, ""Hey Boss, some of the team members really seem to have a hard time with the early hours I put in. Normally I wouldn't want to get you involved but they have started doing things that affect my productivity and I want to make sure my performance is not impacted since I really enjoy working here."" Then tell him the specific examples such unadding you, not responding to your messages, and removing you from the work activity calendar.

Your coworkers sound jealous of your work ethic and the relationship with your boss. They have just as much of an opportunity to go in early so they can leave early but they choose not to. 

&gt;""yeah but it’s so hard for us to work when we see you leave because we want to leave""

What a bunch of jealous immature babies! I actually rolled my eyes when I read that."
918,I think he was just looking for reasons to pick on you.
919,"Okay, so first. You're allowed to feel whatever you want to feel. I personally don't care about strip clubs and don't mind if my partner gets lap dances, but that's just me. You're allowed to not care. You're also allowed to care a whole lot and feel cheated on. 

That being said, that's not the issue here.

The issue is that your fiance went to a strip club, considered that the possibility of you feeling cheated on was there, and still went through with it. He could have texted you. He could have called and left a message. He could have said, ""nah, let's not. I'd rather check in with my fiance first"". Instead he thought ""fuck it, who cares what fiance thinks"". 

I really dont think your fiance can write this off as believing that you wouldn't care, because of how guilty he acted. At the very least, I think you two are down for a serious conversation after you figure out how you feel. Messing up is fine. What's not fine is ignoring the fact that you have a fiance/wife and not bothering to check in if you believe you're doing something that could hurt them. 

Also, definitely tell your sister that her husband went to a strip club. Just as much as you're allowed to not care, your sister is allowed to care and feel hurt. Your brother in law gave up any right to privacy when he dragged your fiance to the strip club with him. "
920,"Make sure your savings are in another bank from any accounts he has access to. There have been many incidents where a family member gets access to someone’s account with the assistance of the bank if they know you’re married or parent/adult child. 

Best of luck. Stick to your plan. "
921,"Absolutely, depending on how old your son is, this could be a good opportunity to explain why your experience is personal to you, and your desire to not participate is absolutely not a reflection on him. 

On the other hand, if your husband really said that, he is being a complete jerk about your changes in jobs. Yikes. Sounds like a bigger problem is him not respecting you and your current lifestyle (which you did not choose)."
922,"Yep he’s got some serious issues that he needs to resolve with the help of a therapist. Not to mention how he knowingly put down OP like that. 

@OP he sounds very self absorbed and has deep running self esteem issues. Honestly, given this is only a 5 month old relationship I’d take the above advice and bounce. Btw you are in a much better place mentally than him. It takes a lot of strength admitting you have issues and then working to resolve them. He’s no where near that stage. Don’t let him drag you down with him. Go find someone that doesn’t need constant reassurance just to function. He sounds exhausting to be around."
