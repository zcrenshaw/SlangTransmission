0,"We bought a house that I knew as well.  I was friends with the previous owners and was in the house a lot.  Mind you it wasn't a traumatic experience but I strongly associated the house with the previous owners and felt like a permanent guest in someone's home at the beginning.  But then we renovated, painted everything, and moved in our own furniture.  And instantly it was my house.  I don't even think of the previous owners anymore.  The transformation was surprising and within a few weeks.  I think your wife is right.  You can make the house your own."
1,"If it works for you and you're happy, then who cares what other people think?"
2,"I think telling her would remove a large burden from her.

I would imagine she is torn between doing what she thinks is right, and what is best for you.  

So remove the burden from her so she won't have that weight once you are gone.  Let her break down about this while you are still alive to reassure her, instead of afterwards when it could potentially never ease her burden.

It sounds like a kindness to tell her at this point.

Hell, tell her what you said here and I bet it would help her a ton."
3,"Good for you!

Now, as a piece of advice, as someone who pulled something a little milder than what you did...

It is *imperative* that you do well in school at this point for approximately a million reasons.  If you do well, your parents (who clearly still care about your wellbeing, even if they're angry right now) will start to see that your relationship isn't interfering with your studies.  If you don't, you'll confirm everything they thought about you dating and may pull financial support regardless."
4,"In addition to her grief, she may find herself with debilitating guilt after your death. I think it would be very kind of you to tell her that you know, that you understand how bad your marriage was at the time, and that you forgave her a long time ago so she shouldn't carry that guilt with her anymore."
5,"You are so cool to just up and go camping to clear your head and just get away from the bullshit. Sounds like you're a very mature person. And yes I do wish you luck.

Hardly a surprise that he makes up the lamest excuses for his unbelievably shocking actions. Obviously he needs help but sadly people like this usually never look inwards enough to get it. Best thing fir you is to cut yourself loose from the toxicity. When the time's right you'll find someone.

"
6,I suspect she enjoys the attention she gets from you and she enjoys the opportunity to flirt with someone who feels safe.  I don't think you should read much more into than that.  Do what you need to do to get over the crush you have on her and focus on dating other women who are available.
7,"I have no actual advice for your issue, but for your anniversary weekend there's never been a better time for you to get some old western lingerie, cowboy hat, a cheesy line about why play red dead, when we can PLAY.


PS. If I guess the wrong game message me, I've got some ideas how we could work the Castlevania remake into your anniversary. "
8,"You are too young for this. Don't waste your life on this type of nasty manipulation. And don't ever try to survive on 300 calories a day. You can really hurt yourself in the long term if you eat like that. 

"
9,"Apart from the good advice you've already received, you really need to sit down with the 'friends' who thought it was appropriate to go giving out your personal information to random people on the internet and tell them how shitty that was."
10,this post makes my heart hurt. 
11,"Based off the fact that he refuses to get a STD test done (red flag #1), I'd say it's a fairly safe bet that he did in fact fuck a prostitute. If he was serious about your marriage, he'd get the test done. 

Now we add in the the fact that he's attempting to turn this around and blame it on you (red flag #2). He sounds like a real Prince Charming. 

No, you did not ruin the weekend. Your horrible husband did.

Edit: grammar
"
12,"It sounds like she prob enjoys the attn and might even be attracted, but knows this is a safe space where she can have some flirty energy but not threaten her marriage.

Thing is: at some point, it’s not very nice to you. If you are single and gay, and therefore flirty energy stirs things up for you that you WOULD want to act on...you’re sort of left holding the bag while she can go home to a partner.

I’m not meaning to paint her as cruel (the picture thing tho raises an eyebrow for me) and she might not even be aware of it. But this can just really put the single person in an increasingly painful situation. 

I would see if you can diffuse the tension by changing how you react/talk if you’re not willing to be direct. Do you avoid talking the dates you’re having with her? I would maybe bring that up in whatever way feels natural/comfortable, however you would do that with any other friend. I suspect this might make things momentarily awkward for her but might help her snap out of whatever she is doing."
13,He played this like it was a cute fucking joke that he was about to ruin your marriage. Giggling and hiding under the blanket?? I'm cringing just thinking about this. Do you want the kind of guy that thinks he's being cute by tanking your marriage?
14,"I'm a light sleeper and would find this infuriating. Absolutely talk to her. Ask that she sets one alarm closer to 10.

Alternatively, if she insists one having alarms go off for that long, there are alarms for deaf and hard-of-hearing people that are basically vibrating wristbands. You can find them on Amazon, they work with smartphones. A potential compromise. "
15,"Yea, you should definitely confront them if it made you uncomfortable. "
16,"Your post is a giant list of all the reasons you can’t help her/change her relationship.   So now it’s time to start laying down boundaries to stop it from impacting your life so much.   

Stop tiptoeing around and treating your Flatmate like glass.  She’s an adult, she needs to deal with this like an adult.   I suspect that she is in part feeding off of the drama of having an audience.  

Tell her to shut up when she’s screaming at 2am.   Seriously.   It doesn’t matter what state she’s in, unless she’s literally bleeding on the floor she should not be screaming at 2am in a shared house.  

When she starts to complain about him, shut her down.  “Flatmate, I’ve heard this before and I’m tired of it.”

“I don’t want to hear more boyfriend drama.”

“Look, at this point, if you’re not going to dump him you’re going to have to learn to live with him.   Stop whining about it.”

“You know what I’m going to say, why are you asking me again?”

“Stop talking about your boyfriend.”"
17,"Glad things worked out for you. You mentioned he's your crush but now you're in a FWB arrangement while he's on rebound, just be sure you stay clear-headed about the FWB fact and keep your crushy feelings in check if he ultimately doesn't plan pursuing an emotionally invested relationship with you."
18,Uh... it's very possible that the brown stains aren't poop but are from her past periods and she wants to keep her stained panties separate from the rest of her panties so she can wear them when she's perioding. Just leave it alone OP. 
19,U dorky af. I love it. :) have fun!
20,"OP, get a notebook and write down the date, time, and nature of every single thing that he's done so far.  Memory is unreliable on its own, and you need to document this in case he escalates.  He's already proven himself to be a seriously dangerous individual, please protect yourself as best you can.  Don't be afraid to ask for help, the police will take a statement from you at anytime (in my experience) and talk you through what your options are.  "
21,It sounds like your boyfriend is a sugarbaby. 
22,"No, you didn’t do anything wrong; you were just trying to ensure that if you loaned money you would get it back. 

Friends and family members sometimes don’t like the fact that when money is loaned, they have to pay it back and expect it to be swept under the rug. Your mum is just annoyed she couldn’t get away with doing that with you. 

She should have been proud to know her kid was financially responsible to not only have savings/cash available, but also demonstrating that they will ensure that any money they do loan gets repaid!"
23,I think you should go on a double date with tinder dude and watch his bullshit unfold once Navy shit gets brought up.  That is if tinder dude is ok with it. 
24,[deleted]
25,"Haha, yeah....test.

He wanted the money, when he realized you wouldn't give it, it turned into a ""test.""

Yeah, dump him, he isn't worth a quarter for the payphone."
26,"Blunt truth is that your friendship is over.

 Once he decided to tell you, there is no way anyone is going to be able to forget it, and it would not be fair to him or to your future husband to have any contact with your former friend. 

Just focus on your husband and marriage, and try to live your life the best you can. Your former friend should in no way be a part of it. 

"
27,He's been withholding sex from you for almost a year to punish you because HE almost cheated? Conceiving a child with this man would be a horrible decision. Your marriage won't last another six months at this rate let alone 18 years. 
28,"You have every right to feel used and angry. 

You were Catfished by her friend and there’s no excuse for that. 

You did NOT cheat on your girlfriend. At all, not even a little bit. 

You were using a pre-established method of communication. It’s not like you got a random add or text message from a new number. 

I know it hurts and I don’t discount that but if your girlfriend can’t see that you did nothing wrong, you’re a victim of a sick and cruel individual and cuts her so called friend out of her life then it is best you break up. 

This is not something she should hold over you, you didn’t cheat! You did nothing wrong. 

Your girlfriend should be supporting you right now. Not manipulating you to feel like you cheated. 

It all round sucks and I’m sorry you are going through this. "
29,"""Kindly refrain from fucking in the common spaces, whether or not I am present. Thanks!"""
30,"I don't think it's necessarily a stupid reason, I've heard much worse.

However, realistically when do you think you could expect to have another chance at one of your 'dream homes' again? If it's one every few months, I'd just skip this one.

If not taking this one realistically means having to wait a few years to have a chance at something comparable, then I'd give the 'see if I can make it my own' a chance. "
31,"""normal"" isn't a great goal in relationships. ""meeting both people's needs through respectful communication and compromise"" is more like it, and that will look different for every relationship depending on interests, needs, resources, opportunities, goals, values, etc etc etc. "
32,"text:
hi lexi! mom and dad come home tomorrow, just wanted to make sure it is nice and clean for their return. thanks so much for housesitting! let me know when you are done tidying up and ill come over. i got you a thank you gift."" 
BINGO"
33,"She has a FREE car from YOUR family and YOU pay most of the car expenses and she is complaining?!?!?!

Dude, that is a disgustingly entitled attitude and i would walk away from someone like that."
34,"&gt; and then i explained to him how pathetic it is to be 26 and asking your girlfriend who’s 5 years younger for money for basic necessities and how unattractive being a man baby is.

Sounds like you already got this . . ."
35,"Something like this happened to me. My husband comes from a normal, lovely upbringing and he still felt bad a week later.

I would be gentle with him and tell him, ""Babe, it seems like you're being very hard on yourself for something that was a total accident. I am not at all upset, but I am worried about how much undue blame you're placing on yourself. I won't push you, but whenever you're ready, I'd love to cuddle up with you on the couch and talk. If you're not ready to talk, I'd still love to cuddle up on the couch and maybe watch a movie with you. Is that okay?"""
36,He just literally told you to go prostitute yourself for money and you’re honestly considering whether or not the relationship is salvageable? Hint: it isn’t. This guy is a jerk. 
37,"Go see your mother, and for the amount of time you want, need, and can afford to do.  You'll regret it the rest of your life if you do not.  He can go see his dad, too, and it sounds like a choice for him vs. a priority.

This is not a healthy relationship.  Your husband is selfish and controlling.  There is no give and take here or support.  You all can pursue couseling later.

He's not going to like this and there will be consequences for your relationship, but to my mind those are worth bearing.  Think how he's going to be in 20 years if this continues.  Best to rip the band aid off, and for such an important issue, too.

My best wishes to you and your mother at this time."
38,"He says in his letters that he wants to marry you or for you to have a child with him because those are new and exciting ways he could control you, NOT because he cares about you in the slightest.  Remember that.

&amp;#x200B;

You have been SO BRAVE getting out and getting help.  I know it is exhausting and awful, but you CAN do this.  "
39,"Wow,  i only got to the part where he said you were 'poor trash'. Why are you with this jerk?"
40,"Also, be sure to include that you forgive her because that’s just what she wants to know. It’s clear that this still is on the forefront of her mind so it’d be good to reassure her and let her know you love her and appreciate all she’s done for you in this hard time of yours.

I’m sorry to hear about your cancer, especially at such a young age. I’m sure you’ve lived a life full of love and compassion. Fight strong, rest easy."
41,Am I the only one who doesn’t see this as a happy ending??
42,Ok.. I'm an idiot. Officially 
43,"Do you really want a partner who ends every argument with you with ""Well, at least I wasn't an exotic dancer!""?

He didn't seem like a nice person and you *can* do better than that piece of trash. "
44,"Unfortunately, if you’ve talked to your flat mate and she’s made up her mind that this is what she wants, you have to accept that. Hopefully one day she’ll come to her senses. 

However, in the here and now, she’s being a terrible flat mate. Are you in good contact with your landlord? Speak to them, vaguely if it’s more comfortable, about how you have a roommate you’re having trouble with, a situation you can’t solve yourselves, and what the steps are. 

Then, you haven’t already, tell her straight out she’s keeping you up at night with her shouting and it’s unacceptable, and if it doesn’t stop you’re going to have to ask her to move out. It’s ridiculous for you to pay money for a place you can’t comfortably live. "
45,Stay strong. My ex dragged it out for nearly three months by contacting me in every way possible and the only thing that worked to get him to stop was to stop responding. At all. If you respond “leave me alone” that’s still a response that keeps him hovering. Don’t answer AT ALL. Do not engage at all. You did right to involve the police on this. 
46,"I'm a lesbian and I have met lots of unhappily married straight women who want to use me as a surrogate 'wife' and enjoy the (to them) low stakes fantasy of having a woman in love with them/having a woman pay attention to them/emotionally support them in a romantic way.

It sucks, and it always feels like there's 'something' there, but usually the 'something' is just a needy straight woman."
47,"&gt; Hey, what's going on? You seem distant this week."
48,"If you want to stay together, you desperately need marital counseling. It sounds like there are a lot of issues bubbling up that have been there for a long time and with your wife suffering PPD on top of it, there's no way this isn't going to get worse if you don't have a mediator to help you communicate productively.

In terms of ""subjecting your son"" to separation, plenty of people here (myself included) will tell you that we wished our parents had divorced instead of modeling an unhappy relationship all our lives. I promise you that as your son grows, he will pick up on whatever dynamic you and your wife demonstrate and it will become the measuring stick for his own relationships.

The last thing I'll say:

&gt; About 5 years ago, he was convicted of trying to grope a young boy in a public space which caused some delving into his past and he confessed to other similar incidents.

I'm sorry if I read this wrong but does this man have access to your child??? If so, that is so wildly irresponsible I don't have words for it. He needs to be kept away from your young boy indefinitely."
49,Nope. Follow your instinct. 
50,"Don't keep a relationship with this horrible woman who can't respect you and your marriage. Follow your wife's lead. If her family wants to choose this toxic person over your family, then honestly, let them."
51,"You told him you are still a virgin and his first thought was to organise a threesome...

Wtf...

Clarify the ""no"" and get some serious distance and or break ties. He sounds all sorts of skeevy and ergh. "
52,"In ""The Gift of Fear"" , de Becker says that if someone sends you 800 messages, and you finally snap and tell them to leave you the hell alone - all you've done is taught them that it takes 800 messages to get a response out of you."
53,Him using the lotion as lube isn't the issue here. The issue is how disrespectful he was when you brought up how this bothered you to him and his general lack of respect for you. His disrespectful reaction is a huge red flag. Do you guys have a history of disrespecting each other? Do you normally feel disrespected in your marriage with him? Or is this something new between you two?
54,"Your husband is an asshole and the way in which he a) told you, with giggling and talk of “secrets” and then eventually saying he loves you and your sister? And b) has treated you since, it’s all unacceptable. 

You’re both far too young to be married and I don’t see this ending well, sorry. You haven’t said how old he is but if I could take a guess based on behaviour, I’d say mid-teens. Everyone, EVERYONE knows you don’t tell your wife you have a crush on her sister?? He’s a total fuckwit. 

I think you probably need space. Don’t be a doormat for a man who’s just told you he loves (????) your sister and won’t be honest about what he’s feeling about you because he’s too “tired” or wants to talk later. He doesn’t get to do that. Is there someone you could stay with for a week or so to get your head clear? 

Also I get you, I know what it’s like to want your body to be something it isn’t right now. But not eating isn’t going to make any difference except end with you binging and hating yourself even more afterward. See a doctor, get a plan, talk about your mental health, lose weight in a way that will last. You won’t drop 20kg in a month but you will end up making long term changes.

Good luck. You’re in an awful situation but honestly.. you’re 21. In my opinion, no one is truly ready for marriage at that age. But it’s especially clear your husband isn’t, as I’m not sure he even understand what the difference between a crush and love is. "
55,Some people have different modesty values. Dad isn’t attracted to his daughters  so he doesn’t care—they’re his little girls. Unless you’ve seen some other red flags. If they aren’t being sexualized then I don’t see any issue at all. 
56,"&gt;a 56M paid him to have sex with him

Sounds like he's involved with party drugs? Not to mention, he's got to be on something to think he should divulge that info to you."

58,Red flag #3: Oral on me (which he never does)
59,Your fiance sounds great! Congratulations for your upcoming wedding :) 
60,Divorce and go home. You married a crazy person. 
61,"If you want to tell her that you know and you forgive her, that might ease some of her suffering and guilt. You're tremendously mature for having been able to work through this with your wife and still be able to continue happy for has long as you have. This is a perfect example of how infidelity isn't always an automatic deal breaker and that people can move past it if both are willing to put the relationship ahead of each other.

I wish you peace and comfort with whatever decision you arrive at."
62,"""Not attractive at all"" is rather harsh. And I don't really understand how someone can have a great sex life with someone they are not attracted to ""at all"". Why is she dating you then, why couldn't you just have stayed as friends, or even friends with benefits? Please don't tell us you pay for all the bills and what not.

And if you must lose weight, do it for yourself and your health and not only to please others and hope they are attracted to you. "
63,"&gt; ""Why can't you work more if you need money ? If your night job isn't enough just be a fucking prostitute since you need it so much !""

65,I'm so excited to hear about someone that has so much self-respect and logic. You will totally be okay. :)

67,"Similarly, I have a story about the house I grew up in. 

We lived there 8 years, and then I moved out went to college. My freshman year, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer, and eventually put on hospice at home. For the next year, every memory of the house was of my mom in her hospital bed there. 

About a year after she passed, my dad renovated the house by ripping up all ugly shag carpet and revealing the hardwood underneath. He used part of the life insurance to get new furniture, and repainted all the walls. 

These minor renovations made the house unrecognizable when I visited. I would literally sit right where my mother passed away and not identify it as the same place. Obviously, I still recognized the house, but it made it completely foreign at the same time. 

I'd say to OP to give it a chance, but at the end of the day both need to agree on a house. I'm a cop and there are some houses I've looked at that I've responded to before. Even on my most chronic serious cases, I still wouldn't be hard against one if it was the right house. "
68,"Quick tip - as much as you may want to, stop talking about what your intention was and that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings. The fact is, her feelings *were* hurt, and by you, so your intention *not* to hurt them doesn't matter anymore. This is a lesson I learned slowly and hard. Just focus on her feelings and that you know you hurt them, you understand how you did it, and you (edit:) will do your best to not act that way in the future."
69,"&gt; She has no problems with alcohol except this

WHAT??? It’s blowing my mind right now that you’re trying to downplay this. Your girlfriend has a huge problem with alcohol. Not all alcoholics are the stereotype of that guy that queues outside the liquor store before it opens every morning, swaying in the breeze in last night’s clothes. Someone that has literally ruined relationships due to getting blackout drunk &amp; announcing private information HAS A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL. Someone that can’t have a few drinks without getting blackout drunk has a problem with alcohol. Someone that is mortified by the behavior explained back to them but then continues to repeat that behavior has a problem with alcohol. You should be taking this very seriously, &amp; you should be evaluating whether you want to stay with someone that has a problem with alcohol. Because this is your future until whenever she finally hits her rock bottom, decides to sober &amp; succeeds at doing it. "
70,"&gt;I don't understand his urgency (in fact I never do, and he's not able to communicate why there is any urgency).

That is because there is no reason for it except for putting pressure on you, setting you up for a verbal beating by him. 

He's finding ways to find fault with you. He's berating you for no reason. He's picks fights for no reason and he's being mean.

Whether he likes you or doesn't like you has nothing to do with it, because, as hard as it is to accept, it has nothing to do with you, how you act, what you say. There's nothing you can do to prevent it, either, even when he likes you to go out of your way to try - because he gets everything exactly as he wants it, a compliant wife, and *to berate you in the end anyway*. That's perfect for him.

He's verbally abusive.  This gives him power and it makes him feel good. It's nothing you can fix, really. He needs to want to fix it himself. 

Patricia Evans The Verbally Abusive Relationship is a good source for you, if you want some clarity. 

And take care. This is hard and I'm so sorry. 



"
71,"&gt;Second, I really wasn't ready to have this conversation. We've only been dating for 7 months and we're still in the negotiation phase of our relationship where we're beginning to understand each other on a deeper level and familiarize ourselves with the other's quirks.

Honestly, he did you a favor. Whether or not you want kids is a discussion to have as early as possible - it's not something you want to put off until you get even more attached. What's the point of kicking that can down the road? You end up getting invested in someone with whom you're really not compatible."

74,"So, tell your bf you don’t want him to go for the reasons specified. ( the landlord was mad because you got in an accident and couldn’t work? How is that your fault?)

78,"You had a patient die just a few months ago--that's traumatic. Do you get any emotional support for things like that? Therapy through work? What do you do to take care of your mental health? Because I'm more concerned about that.

Your wife is right, a house can be remade in its owners' image. Your brain can also be remade for the benefit of the person it's driving. If the thought of even seeing the house is this painful for you then you might want to talk it through with a professional, not with her."

Sorry you are going through this by the way, but as others pointed out, direct communication is absolutely the way to go with this one.

83,"Very interesting that she started a post about what I would consider my husband being an asshole about her weight. It’s very telling about her mental and emotion state and how he has affected her.

84,"Look, I'm going to give advice here that is very different from what you usually hear. Your friends aren't bad people nor are they shallow. You've changed and now that you're conventionally attractive *you are now part of the dynamic that has been there all along.*

You just never realized it before, because you were the ""ugly friend"". Real talk, you were not sexualized or considered for hook ups because none of the girls were attracted to you. That's why you were treated like a brother by everyone. You were perpetually in the friend zone, so you weren't a part of the hook ups and dating culture of your mixed gender social group.

&gt;I've literally noticed a certain sense of competition and hostility from the guys now that wasn't there before, and it bugs me out.

Of course, you are now ""on their level"" so your status has changed. You *are* competition for girls. Shocking as it may feel to you, it's entirely predictable for your age group.

&gt;I slept with two of the girls in my friend group. So I suppose I can see why all of the other girls now think I am 'up for grabs' or whatever.

If hookup culture and meaningless flings isn't for you, that's fine. It isn't for a lot of people, myself included. Your friend group is somewhat promiscuous so as long as you're unattached/single the other women in the group will pursue you as available.

* **Start talking about looking for a girlfriend.** You want monogamy as you've found casual hook ups aren't your thing. Keep mentioning this and eventually your female friends will get that you mean it. You're not a hook up option for them.

* When you're out with your guy friends and they joke about you being competition for the ladies *respond* you aren't in the running. You're in ""monk mode"" until you find someone worth your time and **you'll be happy to be their wingman!** Stepping aside and helping your bros hook up will diffuse any notion that you're a ""threat"".

* **Limit your time with flirty female friends.** No more sleepovers or anything that blurs the lines. When they say things that make you uncomfortable, change the subject and bid them good night. Keep your distance until they get the hint you're only interested in platonic friendship."
85,"Rock that fuckin’ boat. 

Tip it all the way over. "
86,"&gt;he accused me of accusing him of being a negligent partner and addicted to video games.

If he can't handle going on a vacation without taking his console then I think both of these descriptions are accurate.

&gt;Is that kicking a dead horse? I know if I bring it up again it will just ruin the whole day for him (and therefore ruin my day too).

Did he agree not to bring the console?  If so then I think you let this go."

This is who he is now, and you have to accept that and get rid of him before he wastes any more of your valuable time."
91,"I agree.

OP you said:

&gt;I just needed to know that I was the most important person to him, or that he wouldn't leave me, or just something to hold on to. **I asked something like ""I just need to know that I'm still enough for you"" and he couldn't respond to that**, which absolutely shattered my heart again. ""Don't make me try to say specific things right now

/u/Kynm you already have your answer.

You are 21 years old and got married at 18. You're too young to waste your time and endanger your life trying to hold on man who doesn't love the way you love him.

His attention is elsewhere and he crossed a major boundary by coveting your sister. This is so wrong. Where does he think this will lead? Becoming sister-wives? Hell nah! 

If you told him you have a crush on your brother he wouldn't be cool with you sexualizing his family members!"
92,I think you’re right on the money with your comment. Definitely focusing my efforts elsewhere. Thanks for your perspective.

97,"Ruined *weekend*?  He should be worried about the ruined *marriage*!  


The fact that he tried to bang a prostitute is what ruined the weekend, not you.  And the fact that he hasn't taken the test is a giant red flag.  Please stop blaming yourself and look at the glaring red flag waving in your face.   And stop trying to ""get over it"".  This is not something to get over.  He has zero respect for you as evidenced by the prostitute and the fact that he's blaming you.  Do not have kids with him.  Do not get over this.  "
98,"You need to dump him, he's a fucking jerk. This is six months in, the honeymoon period. This is supposed to be when the relationship is 100% *fun* and romantic. 

He wants you to be ashamed of this - meanwhile I'm 100% sure he watches porn and has been to a strip club in his life. Date men who aren't hypocrites.

edit: also - NEVER skip work for him. This is a thing that seventeen year old girls do, not grown women. Make your money."
99,"I'm surprised that the comments so far are not stronger. Cody is jealous and threatened, not just by Ben but by your lab partner, and now he's crossed over into violence. This is not acceptable. Also, in the aftermath he didn't show remorse. Quite the opposite, he got angrier. 

Honestly, I think this is not acceptable in a bf and you need to bail. You're young; don't start settling for a partner who is violent without reason. Even if Ben said something provocative to Cody, that would not justify this. 

You would actually be doing Cody a favor by breaking up with him over this, rather than accepting it. If you accept it, then you encourage this path he's going down of possessiveness, jealousy, and violence. If instead you break up with him, he will learn there are large consequences."
100,"Leave the pregnancy thing out of his for a second. You told your friends that you were taking medication and didn’t want to drink alcohol, and they gave you drinks with alcohol nonetheless?? That’s a horrible thing to do to someone. You could have been on medication that, by drinking with it, made you violently ill, required you to be hospitalized, or negated the effects of the medication. If you were on a certain combination of drugs, you could have died by adding alcohol to that mix. This is egregious and extremely serious, to the point where they could be criminally prosecuted for doing this. It’s your decision whether to forgive them or not, but either way they did something that is horrible, beyond the pale. They had no idea what medications you were on, and it didn’t occur to them that this could have seriously harmed you. At he very least, they have no regard for your well being. They don’t sound like friends to me. "
101,"You are definitely not over reacting and you have done the right thing so far. They are clearly using you and your hospitality and not being respectful. 

Q: If they have a kitchen in the basement why arent they using it?

Dont do anything for now but do ask for your xbox back and next time this happens take pictures of before and after with time stamps to show to your husband, not that he doesnt believe you, its more so he can show them. Also, use voice recorder on your phone. If this continues you will have to kick them out "
102,"why dont you go for a viewing without your wife and see how you feel? im guessing you dont want her to view it in case she falls even deeper in love with it and then thats it lol

it may feel different to you now it is empty but i think it may be worth a try "
103,"Not weird at all, and your friends are trying to apply a ""one size fits all"" rule to your relationship. My wife and I both enjoy our alone time - at the moment we're both home so do various things together during the day, but of an evening I'll generally be on the computer while she watches TV / reads / studies in a different room. We're both equally happy being together too! Friends of mine said they learned soon after living together that one of them needs an hour post-work to recharge alone, then they spend the evening together. Other people enjoy spending all their time together (although the cynic in me can't help but think that's one person demanding it, and one person going along with it - that's a recipe for resentment!).

Each to their own! Far better to work with your partner to ensure both of your needs are met, rather than worry about what you ""should"" do or what's ""normal"". History is littered with broken up couples because one/both of them tried to fit square pegs into round holes. You're happy? She's happy? Then be happy, stop worrying, and tell your friends that you're just fine thanks. If in the future it becomes a problem, deal with it then."

108,"Hi OP. I wanted to give you a perspective from the ""other"" side. 

When my fiance and I started dating years ago, I was not physically attracted to him. He just wasn't anything I thought I'd seen myself with. I struggled with that for a while actually, because he was amazing in all these other fantastic ways. 

I'm a strong proponent of one's perception of physical attractiveness morphing and adapting over time. He hasn't changed, but now I think he's pretty damn sexy! AND he has all these other amazing qualities (that were there before) to boot. 

It's also important to remember that we will not look like this forever. Age brings many physical changes, not all of them are necessarily ""attractive"". Looks don't last, but the chemistry can!

I'm not saying this will happen for everyone, but it is possible."
109,"Get the prescription, start taking your medication, she'll get over it."
110,"Therapist here. I’m going to throw out a possible theory for all of this as a counter to your theory. Always good to have an alternate perspective, right? So here’s my theory: 

You go to this psychologist to deal with grief and depression at the insistence of your parents and girlfriend. You may have been having some radical thoughts that you expressed to them, which were also concerning them. You are getting treated, fairly successfully, by the psychologist for the grief and depression. In the meantime, you begin to have some more erratic behaviors and express ideas that are outside of your usual, which concern them enough to mention possibly hospitalization. This spurs you to think that due to this, they are trying to replace you with the psychologist. 

Let me point a few things out: 

- the average age of onset for schizophrenia is between 18-28, and is far more prevalent in men then in women. It may be possible that you began expressing comments or thoughts that are delusional in nature, leading them to express concern and pose the possibility of hospitalization out of concern for your wellbeing and safety. Not because the are trying to replace you. 

- to piggyback off of the previous point, after they posed the hospitalization to you, you definitely started to experience intense paranoia and delusions about being replaced, when rationally, your parents can’t actually replace you, and the psychologist has never met your girlfriend, so she couldn’t possibly know him well enough to simply usurp you and replace you with him. 

- let’s look at this realistically: these people are your loved ones. Even if you are going thru a difficult time, parents don’t stop loving you, and your girlfriend won’t just agree to date someone she doesn’t know. Additionally, is your psychologist married or in a relationship? I would venture to guess this is likely a yes. I somehow doubt his partner will be cool with him just leaving his life, and I doubt he would want to. Lastly, there is a plethora of HIPAA laws that not only prevent this, but that fly in the face of your suspicions. He would lose his career, job, and income if any of this happened to you, and I doubt he will throw away 8+ years of schooling for a new (and likely unwanted) set of parents and a girlfriend who is staggeringly younger. 

My point is, your next step is to step back, and have a realistic conversation with yourself. Do you really think that a 30s male doesn’t have parents (who he may have an amazing relationship with), a partner (which even if he doesn’t have one, he would be nearly 7-10 years older than yours, and I doubt as a mental health professional would see any benefit to dating someone in a different stage of life), and willing to throw away 8-10 years of hard work, schooling, and a very well paying career, to leave his life to have your parents and girlfriend? I think not. 

You need to report these feelings and thoughts to him. Do some research on schizophrenia. You may be having your first episode, and if you are, you need to begin medication to manage this, which you will be on for the rest of your life. I hope my input has helped. "
111,Yeah the giggling and the hiding under the sheets made me gag. That’s not how a grown man talks about things. That’s how a child deals with things. 
112,"&gt; She takes issue with things I do that don't concern her; my art and music is a problem because it's time away from her, my other responsibilities are a problem because they're time away from her, my family life and social circle are a problem because they're time away from her, walking my dog is a problem because it's time away from her

This is a major red flag, OP. This goes beyond clingy and into the realm of abusively controlling - one of the hallmarks of abuse is that they try to isolate you from your friends and family so that you have no-one but them to fall back on. Between that and the fact that she basically doesn’t let you sleep (she knows what time you need to get up for work, the fact that she’s still hanging around past midnight on a work night after you’ve specifically talked to her about this shows that she *doesn’t care*), I would break up with this girl yesterday if I were you. "
113,For all I know this was a standard deviation from the norm!!!
114,"Everything is great FOR YOU. The only issue FOR YOU is decrease in intimacy. There is a whole list of issues FOR HER that basically all stem from your lack of motivation compared to hers. That is a huge incompatibility. While you’ve been basically content with your life for the past five years, she has been unhappily waiting for you to be ready to move in, to be ready to propose, to be ready to move out, to be ready to have a career. She doesn’t want to be with someone that she has to wait around for, to poke &amp; prod &amp; nag until they’re ready to take the step she’s ready to take. She wants to be with someone that shares her life goals. Trying to convince her to say because the relationship is still working FOR YOU is incredibly selfish, when you’re clearly aware of all the reasons it isn’t working FOR HER. "
115,"I got nothing. You're doing all you can and then some -- depression can be tough to deal with but at a certain point he needs to take responsibility for himself and his children. Health-wise, it's pretty alarming that he's already developing some substantial health problems from his weight gain, considering he's in his 20s where people tend to put on weight with fewer health consequences. As described, you've essentially got three children you're taking care of and that's plainly not fair to you -- as his health declines further (and it will) it's only going to get worse. 

You are not his mom. You are his partner. I'd consider laying it on the line: ""Your children need a healthy father who will see them grow to adulthood. I need a partner. I know you are struggling and I will be your ally every step of the way but 1) you need to be open and honest with me about where you're struggling and 2) you need to take this seriously. Otherwise, we are *gone.*"" If he doesn't take it seriously, consider taking the kids to a family member or friend's house. Maybe not having his ""mom"" around to take care of him will be the wake up call he needs.

Best of luck to you, truly. "
116,"Call local family law lawyers for an intake. See what they can offer you and what it means for custody and financials.

In the mean time, start looking for ways to reorganize your life. If you are a single mom, what avenues could you rely on? Who could keep your kids, how much could you work... basically just get your research done, so you're informed of all options. Sometimes they have programs for single moms for instance, to return to the workforce. You don't have to sign up yet, just become aware of all that exists out there. Then it will be a lot easier to leave."
117,"In high school my brother and I shared a wall between our rooms. He could never wake up to his alarms, so my mom got him a hearing impaired one with a vibrating flat ball thing to put under his pillow. 

He would set his alarm for 5:30 am for weight training, and I wouldn’t have to get up until 7 or so. 

This new alarm goes off, he STILL won’t wake up, and the vibrating thing would slide to the edge of his bed, against the shared wall, and was sooooo freaking loud and vibrates my whole room and made a shit ton of noise. I laughed about it the first few times, but eventually I got fed up and pulled the whole run into his room and yell at him to get up because his alarm was so freaking annoying and this shit needs to stop.

It worked on my bro, he became more considerate. Maybe act like an immature little sister and try that. It might work..."
118,"You can't stop her from moving to your city. You can stop her from damaging your sanity and your relationship by **telling** her, as early as possible, that she will not be getting a key. And that there will be no ""drop in"" visits, ever. And that you'll see her (or call her, or whatever) exactly as often as your availability dictates-- and no more.

This will probably upset her considerably. There's no magic way to approach this that will make her take it well. You still need to do it. Of course, these are all things you could have done in your current city, but given that she's contemplating following you hundreds of miles and spending money she doesn't have in pursuit of an outcome that isn't going to happen, it's that much more important you tell her now."

Fill them in on EVERYTHING, including the original post and the fact that your “friends” revealed your real name (I’d put out an APB on your social media to NEVER DO THAT). Make it clear that this guy is not bringing in cash, and that his intent seems to be to frighten you. 

If your boss is even halfway reasonable, this guy is getting banned after a sharp talking-to. And you’ll be getting an escort to your bike at the end of your shift for the foreseeable future. Hopefully that’s enough to get the message across, but document everything just in case he escalates and you need to get the law involved.

You should also be in therapy for yourself and your self esteem. You communicated that things were moving too fast but then said yes to a proposal to man you've known for 5 months. You are allowed to say 'no' or even 'not yet'. Unfortunately you don't know someone well after 5 months and you're dealing with this now. Don't beat yourself up too much.

No. He got food poisoning and is home sick. You're not asking him to stay home, you're telling him he is. He doesn't get to be there and he doesn't get to be in ANY family photos. Lawyer up first thing Monday morning.  

Is there ANYONE you can confide in right now? Obviously not your sister, lol. 

Also, see if you can find a way to make him leave the home willingly. ""If there's any chance of this working out, you will be gone from the home when I get back from the reception.""  Use his hope of you rolling over to his advantage. It might buy you a few days to gather your thoughts. 

One text. ""You have food poisoning and are unable to make it to the wedding. I will send your regrets. If there is any chance whatsoever of this working out, you need to be gone when I get home from the reception. Do not text me and do not call me. I need time to process.

You got a good head on your shoulders, don't question yourself here.  This guy sounds like a user.  He makes fun of you for not having a hookup phase?  He either tests you or believes you need to give him hundreds of dollars on demand? Sounds like he doesn't respect you and no one needs that."

She was already dealing with pain she didn't want to deal with emotional guilt on top of that if you came back etc.  Would you want her to carry that guilt??? No.  So let it go. I understand you wanted to know, to show her she can count on you, etc etc... But she has feelings too.   Y'all just discuss what each of y'all would want next time and move on. "
130,"Your son is not mentally or emotionally mature enough for college. Barely passing high school should have been a sign that higher education is not his current priority.

131,"It sounds like he's doing his best to express his opinions without hurting you, but might not be doing the best job of it. I think he wants you to be happy and healthy, but is scared of how far you'll go with weight loss. To be fair, he seems to have no desire to control what you're doing and knows it's his issue that he is less attracted to you when you're smaller. He can't control that either...we are attracted to what we are attracted to, and it's an important part of any relationship to have sexual chemistry. I think you should do what makes you happy and just continue to talk about this. Acknowledge that if you ask his opinion, though, he's allowed to give you an honest answer. As long as he's not trying to make you do anything, he's allowed to feel what he feels."
132,"Does she want you to try breathing underwater too?

I'd bet my bottom dollar this weird pushyness is coming from her bigoted boyfriend. You need to seriously consider that this woman is not the ""best friend"" you see her as: no sane or decent human, much less someone claiming to be a friend of yours, would ever try and push you into a heterosexual relationship knowing that you are gay. That is profoundly disrespectful to you.

this is also really shitty because it suggests that she believes you can ""choose"" who to be attracted to or date, **or** she knows this is crazy but cares more about her boyfriend's desire for you to be straight than your own needs as a person. Or both. But whether her own views have shifted to be shitty and stupid, or whether she's simply parroting her boyfriends stupid and shitty views, the bottom line is that she is way over the line here and it has to stop.

The next time she says it, tell her this:

""FriendsName, I don't know how many times to say it: stop suggesting I date Adam. It's incredibly rude. It's incredibly disrespectful. And I am tired of having to tell you this when you know damn well I'm not interested in men. You have been my friend for many years, but the next time you bring up this topic will be the last time we talk.""

Conversations like this _never_ lead to a good end.

Jesus, what an asshole. It almost sounds like he trying to arrange a threesome with you and your sister ... 

&gt; his fantasy is him holding both of our hands at the same time. I didn't say anything for a long time. I said ""I love you"" and he....said... ""I love you. I just love you both.""

Oh wait, that's _exactly_ what he wants ... 

This is just so incredibly wrong and disrespectful to you. He's using your issues with weight and self-worth as a tool to try to hook up with your sister. That's just so _wrong_. 

But don't let him intertwine your own issues with his messed up fantasy. Wrong on so many levels. 


"
135,"I had a coach who was severely injured on her way home from practice once and was comatose for months and they did not think she would ever regain consciousness (she eventually did but is extremely low functioning). She was in an extremely serious long term relationship at the time (if I remember correctly they had picked out a ring). He was at the hospital every week for months and to my knowledge he still goes and spends time with her at her assisted living facility once a month. This was a person that she likely loved dearly. You have said yourself (and I would suspect part of the reason you love her) is because how how caring and empathetic she can be. I think in your head you may be framing this as a circumstance where, because it was her boyfriend, it makes it creepy or weird or that she may still be holding on to something. Instead think about it that this person was a huge part of her life and that person was ripped away. She clearly has moved on especially if you have talked future long term goals for the relationship. She goes and spends time with him because he was a huge part of her life and likely she doesn’t want to feel like she is abandoning him. It sounds like she goes and talks to him about what is new in her life and what is exciting to her. She would do the same thing with a close family member. She sounds like a wonderful person that is willing to make meaningful commitments to people and will stick with you through good times and bad (whether as a partner or a friend) and that is more than a lot of people on this sub and real life can say. You got a keeper. Meet him once because it’s important to her and if it makes you uncomfortable don’t go again. As you continue on with your life and grow as a couple she will naturally go less and less to visit him. But she will likely always visit him even if it’s sparingly. "
136,"This feels less like ""poor financial decisions"" and more like an over-arching ""I'm not responsible for my life, things 'just happen' and I'm the victim here.""

He was willing to throw away his job because he saw it as an opportunity for things to just ""not work out"" where he could rationalize himself as a victim of ""circumstances beyond his control"" yet again. Same with the tickets. He could have taken responsibility/control and just bought his own tickets and let his friend fend for himself. But he was happily content to have it be his ""friend's fault"" that circumstances were bad to him once again. But again, he doesn't want to say anything to his friend about it, because that would be putting effort towards fixing/improving his situation. And also because, he secretly knows it's no one's fault but his own.

His new job is already not happy with him. I predict more situations like this to come up (that you may not even hear about), and him to potentially get fired at some point when they've had enough, enabling him once again to be the victim of unfortunate circumstance."

139,"&gt; But then we renovated, painted everything, and moved in our own furniture. And instantly it was my house.

Exactly!  I have a very similar experience, but in the opposite direction.  I once had the opportunity to go back and walk through the house I grew up in (ages 0-10) after the new owners had lived in it for several years, and it did NOT feel like my house anymore.  Once I walked through the front door, it didn't even give me a nostalgic feeling.

OP, I think you should listen to your wife on this one.  Once you paint, move in your own furniture, and maybe even rearrange a few walls (you mentioned ""renovation""), you'll forget you ever worked in that house before."

148,"He sounds like a 14 year old girl at a sleepover, telling her best friend that she has a crush on the star quarterback.

And then I got to this part...

&gt;So, at least I had the ""I'm not going anywhere"" to hold on to. **But I started sobbing. and he fell asleep anyway**

That dude is fucking ice cold. SMDH


**Edit** I just re-read the post and I'm just so absolutely disgusted. OP, you're only 21, you have the rest of your life ahead of you. Please don't stay with a guy that is making you consider having an eating disorder. He may not be physically abusing you, but he damn sure is mentally abusing you. You deserve someone better than a guy that replies with ""same"", after you telling him that you wish he was crazy about you. He is a self-centered piece of shit that doesn't care about how his words and actions affect you."
149,"""I knew this was a touchy subject with my girlfriend""

Still you asked your friend, why?

How many talks like this you guys had before? "
150,"Like others have said... sounds like he's in love with you. I think he might have said he would plan the wedding and was ok with it all because of his respect and love for you and his brother, but as the wedding draws closer the reality is hitting him that you and his brother are actually really getting married and that's probably rustled a lot of feelings in him. 

This might be the advice of a random online but I think in the end its up to him to sort out those feelings and decide what to do and there isn't much you guys can do since its most likely an internal struggle he's dealing with. Maybe just treat him like you guys always have, get married, enjoy your wedding, and hope in the end J has the strength to get past his internal strife. Also once your married it might give him some closure knowing that there isn't really a chance for him anymore?"
151,"Uh what’s not a good look is Agnes frequently shifting the convo to sex. Combined with a lot of nighttime interactions, it’s really odd you’ve let it continue to the point where OTHERS had to point it out.

Do your male friends often text you at 3am saying that they’re thinking of you, because they saw something cute? Come on dude. "

154,"I spend my days working underground in a ""clean environment."" It drains on you and is a huge contributor to depression... I don't see sunlight until I leave work and during the winter, that means I experience less than an hour of sunlight a day. Lucky for me, I love my job. Your boyfriend doesn't. No wonder he is depressed.

Your SO's desire for a job he enjoys and for happiness is just as valid as your desire for stability and kids.

There are ways to make this work for both of you. Neither of you have children, so there's no reason you can't both work as many jobs as needed to avoid more debt until he completes the engineering program. If that doesn't work for you and he is firm on his want to follow his dream, then maybe it's time to go your separate ways.

155,"Am I the only one who thinks it's crazy that you needed to get his permission to accept a job you clearly want? It's not nuclear physics that would expose you to radiation or something, it's a flower shop.

I think you should take the job and maybe consider moving out of this guy's house. I feel like the gist of this is that he prefers to have the upper hand over you. This doesn't seem healthy and there's a real weird vibe to your whole story. What's he gonna do, use random excuses like this to veto stuff he doesn't like forever? That's not a relationship, it's parole."

157,"&gt;(he owes me about $4,000, which I am totally cool with and don't pressure him to pay me back faster at all).

and he owes OP 4,000 after dating for 18 months total... OP is getting worked and she's watching it happen. Why would you willingly date a financially distressed 40 year old with a childish disposition who can't stand on his own two feet after how many years on his own, when you're a 26 year old nurse with (likely) your whole quality life in front of you?"
158,This is so goddamn funny 
159,"It's weird that she didn't even tell you right away and waited later to tell you. Like you said it definitely looks like she avoided it.

If I were you I'd tell her you're not interested in moving in that place with her and suggest her to find a roommate.

Don't let her make those kind of decisions without you and then expect you to be ok with it and to just go along. It's absolutely unacceptable."

I don't know, I feel like him dating someone else is a good reason to dump him.  "
161,"Being extremely awkward and shy is a much bigger handicap than your physical appearance. Fortunately, it's something you can actually change. Work on yourself. Go to therapy, go to the gym, get good sleep, focus on your career/hobbies, etc. Get outside of your comfort zone by making an effort to put yourself out there and be more social. This will mean lots of awkwardness and embarrassment, but that's how you learn to be more comfortable and confident in yourself.

Don't let your fears run your life. There's always things you can fix right now, but not if you let yourself be overcome by your internal anxiety and negative thoughts. That recurring thought that you'll always be alone is not reality, it's your enemy. Don't listen to it."
162,This is abusive and you should absolutely leave him. Do not under any corcimstances go to therapy with him. 
163,"**Stand your ground**. Do not be guilted or manipulated into agreeing to this. Just because they are related to you does not mean you are obligated to not only house them, but also pay for all their shit, and they are certainly not entitled to that.

Also, not that it matters, but her comment about how nobody would want you as their daughter in law is just laughable. "
164,"There's no such thing as ""trying to break up with someone."" She *did* break up with you, very definitively. If someone says ""you know where I stand, I want my stuff back,"" then you are broken up, no ifs ands or buts about it. "

167,"Great advice. People often find something to feel guilty about after a loved one's death even if they don't have a specific reason to. 

I'm honestly moved by the generosity and unselfish love you're showing in this post, and think forgiving your wife explicitly will be one of the greatest gifts you could give her. "
168,"Oh lordy... 

So this one time my youngest, then 3, flung himself onto his sleeping father and smashed him directly in the nuts. 

At which point there was like a convulsion thing... totally natural considering... which rocketed youngest about four feet straight up and back right into the wall. He then slid down the wall and between the wall and bed. 

I look over like OMG and my ex's eyes are the size of dinnerplates and we're both like holy fuck you've killed the boy...

And this wee hand appears from behind the bed and he chirps, ""I'm okay!""

...


Another one, because this one is even funnier. I had this dog. A big dog. Not super fond of strangers. Driving along with dog in backseat and bf in passenger seat... and I get pulled over. I'm getting my licence n stuff together when I hear the cop approaching the car say, ""What a beautiful dog!"" and see him reach towards him (dog had stuck his head near my shoulder because open window/stranger coming).

It all happened at once. I looked up to say, ""Actually sir, he's not good with strangers!"" just as the dog decided to lunge at the cops' hand with a terrific RRROWWWFFF! and my bf in a panic decided to just grab and restrain the dog. 

So all he did was wildly swing his arm to where the dog is, with no regard to the fact that between him and dog is ME. He just smashed his whole hand/wrist area directly into my face. He broke my fucking nose. 

Cop goes, ""OMG! OMG! MA'AM!?""

Bf goes, ""OH NOOOOO!!"" Probably thinking in his zeal to not get a your dog ate three of my fingers ticket he was likely about to get a you beat your woman one.

Dog is barking merrily away.

Ever been punched in the face? Even by accident it still triggers that profound sense of rage/violation. 

So I hollered at EVERYONE. The dog to shut the fuck up. At my bf to not touch or look at me. At the cop to go back to his squad car. Not sure what I was thinking there but I was bleeding a lot and had just been hit in the face and I was pretty fucking overwhelmed. And the best part?

The cop DID. He just noped out of the whole fucking thing. Drove away. 

2/10 would not recommend bf accidentally breaking your nose to get out of mystery traffic stop. 

But there you go. You've a proud lifetime of closing doors and drawers on each other and pets and children. Can't be helped. Gotta just roll with the punches and hope maybe they get you out of a ticket."
169,"He sure doesn't respect your time. Talk is a lot cheaper than 12 bucks an hour for a babysitter.

Next time he is looking to go out, have three sitters numbers on hand, and ask where the two of you are going out. 

If he whines when you don't take his responsibility off his hands for him, yeah, walk away now. That's not going to change.

Don't have a wishbone where your backbone should be. "
170,"&gt; You're tremendously mature for having been able to work through this with your wife and still be able to continue happy for has long as you have.

It really did help the fact that she met me half-way. We put in a lot of work and just seeing her dedication to fixing our marriage is what made me forget about her affair in the first place. I've never had any worries that she will stray away. She remained dedicated to me and our family for another 20 years. I am sure of that. 

I will probably tell her but I don't know if I should just write her a long letter detailing everything or talking to her face to face. In your opinion, what would be best, if you were me?"
171,"He _is_ a pushover. He’s the very definition of pushover, nor does he have your back. He seems to put you last, after some neighbors who treat you like crap. "
172,"He wants you at home and isolated. Most normal humans would be pleased for their partner to have a friend, and want to meet them. 

Your husband is so disinterested in things you are passionate about that he claims that someone you have told him about on several occasions, dating back months, is someone he’s “never heard about”. I would be raging with anger at that comment alone. Why doesn’t he listen to you? Why doesn’t he care about what you say? How dare he act like a tantruming child because you dared to exist as your own person. 

What does your husband bring to your life? "
173,"i feel like i need a copy/paste response for every 'early 20s girlfriend tries to navigate the emotional whims of late 30s boyfriend' r/relationships post.

you've done nothing wrong. this is his own insecurity that he's projecting on to you. you were trying to be helpful and are behaving completely reasonably. don't let him use his own self-hatred as an excuse to treat you badly."
174,"Definitely don’t pay for him. It sounds like he still keeps you around for the convenience and the free food. 

He sounds like a complete ass!"
175,"I’m always confused when I read posts like these. No offense intended but... do you not respect yourself or the future of your future child? Because this man **definitely** does not. You’re being overly reasonable and he refuses to abide by even that, and tried to blame you. You know you’re worthy of people actually liking you, right?"
176,Actions are louder than words my friend.
177,"My boyfriend and I have been together over a decade.  I am in sales. I am also an introvert.  Some days I am just exhausted from dealing with people all day.  I hide in my room and fall asleep while binge watching some show or another. 

He reminds me if I have been too distant too much,  though, and invites me to watch anime or a movie with him.

I appreciate his patience and that he ask for quality time without being a jerk about it.

It works pretty well. "

179,"Wait.. so she didn’t have a car.. you got her the Buick, and she doesn’t want to “downgrade”? From what? She didn’t have a working car. How do you downgrade from zero. Sounds like the most entitled brat ever. Yes, this is baffling "
180,"Send his wife a private message on FB. Send her screenshots of your convos/emails. She deserves to know.

Do not out him on the public Facebook post. Satisfying as that would be, it could actually backfire by being seen as a drama-seeking move, and thus make it easier for him to explain away. This will be hard enough for her to deal with while pregnant, and perhaps most importantly they are still married, and his public humiliation would be humiliating for her too. She doesn't deserve that insult to the injury he's already done. Give her the truth and let her decide what to do with it.

"
181,"Thanks, I really needed to hear that. It’s been hard staying strong as some of those letters declaring his undying love yadda yadda yadda were quite persuasive especially as I’m 33 and worried I won’t meet anyone else. He knows I want to settle down so perhaps that’s also why he’s pulling out the marriage and babies card.

These replies on here are really helping me to see through his BS and to keep going no contact.

"
182,"Okay, everyone else has got the exotic dancing part of this handled. So I’m asking a different question. Why on earth does he think you need to skip work to watch his football team with him? I cannot imagine asking my partner to skip work for something that is (1) my interest &amp; not theirs &amp; (b) not a once-in-a-lifetime, literally-can’t-miss-it event. I also can’t imagine thinking an argument that’s not literally a life-&amp;-death issue is worth making my partner late for work. I’m not sure if he doesn’t respect your work because it’s self-employed instead of scheduled by a manager, but seriously, you don’t need that. “My partner made me miss work” is something I would expect from someone a full decade younger than you. "
183,"Sometimes people say in another life in a sort of nostalgic, romantic way- like, if the situation had been different we would be together- which I can understand being a little bothered by as your gf since it's like saying you have feelings for someone but the logistics didn't work out. However, your gf seems very, very insecure and also probably doesn't understand what being autistic means, so you might want to break up "
184,"After all the other relationship issues you brought up, including The fact that you are not making progress in therapy, why does his reaction surprise you? You mentioned abusive behavior, but only brought up the OCD aspect of the clean house.

Abuse is a dealbreaker. End of story."
185,"My mom has lived her whole life walking on my dad’s eggshells. My mom definitely isn’t perfect, but doesn’t deserve to be treated like dirt. No one does. My dad would refuse to do counseling. Don’t live like her and end up not alone, but may as well be.

I’m afraid if he doesn’t see a problem or want to try and fix it, then you know what to do. "
186,"&gt; Is she trying to get him behind my back?

No, sounds like she's trying to do it in your face. 

He needs to block her texts immediately and you need to think about not having her in your home as much. After you explain to her quite clearly that you don't appreciate her showing her breasts to your husband, of course."
187,"You don't have enough to say he cheated on you. If you don't trust him, couples counseling might be a good next step. "
188,"Exactly. The first time, I would've gotten out of bed and said STFU! We are trying to sleep! I mean what in the world is this girl thinking that she can scream and cry at that hour, waking everyone up?"
189,"Bad timing and even worse judgement. 

He should have keep that to himself. Telling you a week out from the wedding was inconsiderate..you've got enough to deal with without the burden of his feelings.


And he has really deep, REALLY strong, longstanding feelings for you.


A friendship isn't tenable until he's only platonically interested. He's clearly in for more than that.


Sorry to say, but this friendship has ended. And now, he gets to spend the rest of his life wondering ""What if I had said yes!?"" This situation sucks all around.

You live, you learn.

Sorry :("
190,Seriously. What kind of world do they live in?
191,"Your bf has a troubling view of the world- in that situation, your bf didn't 'just get screwed over', he didn't think ahead and ACT and caused the issue himself. He'd rather explain the situation as just something that happened to him, rather than something he could have controlled and done differently. That shows that he's immature, conflict-averse, and willing to play the victim rather than be criticized."
192,"Sorry dude, she's a controlling and possessive lunatic who has serious emotional and psychological issues. Get the hell out of this situation because there's no way it's going to improve and you definitely don't deserve to live your life in constant fear of her having another insane public meltdown!"
193,"It’s possible that from your husband’s perspective, your gift was nicer and hers simply cost more.  What’s weirder to me is the fact that she felt comfortable asking him for this.  "
194,"I would talk to the owner and see about getting him banned. He's being weird and obsessive, plus his behaviour is escalating with that yelp review. I would tell your friends (maybe make a public post) and say please don't give out he location of my work or my real name because of incidents like xyz. 

If it was him who posted the review he's angry that his fantasy didn't become reality - look after yourself and document his behaviour. Be careful about anyone following you home. It sucks that I even have to give you that advice, some men need to learn that women aren't just characters in their weird rom-com who'll love that he's been obsessed with you for ages. Oh, and that if you say no you're rude and ugly (or fat in this case)."
195,Why isn't this the top comment? OPs kid is literally prostituting themselves and most people are more concerned that the kid is failing his college courses.
196,"Just keep that cam up and if they trespass on your property again, call the cops again.

Do you still have the note? The scooter was on your property, right? You could turn that in to the cops as well."
197,"That guy sounds like he's obsessed with you. He got angry you were pregnant because he had a picture of you in his head that was of a chaste, virginal girl who was waiting for him to sweep her off her feet. But you weren't like that, and it was in a permanent way he couldn't deny. So his next best option (in his gross old mind) to get the real you match back up with the you in his head was if you somehow didn't *really* have a baby. 

You should try talking to the police. Does he know where you live, and does anyone who is in contact with him know where you live? Do you have any more family or trusted friends nearby that you can make aware of the situation, who can provide you with a safe place to stay if you need it?"
198,"Hey, as someone who grew up with really strict, conservative parents... I'm really proud of you. Standing up to parents isn't easy, especially when they steamroll you with demands and ultimatums and yelling. The fact that you got your protests in and did it with civility and class (seriously, when you told mom that you and your girlfriends' intimate affairs was none of her business I nearly cheered) is great and I'm glad that it worked out, more or less, in the end.

I hope your study abroad goes well, and I hope things with your girlfriend do too!"
199,This person doesn’t care about you or respect you. Get away from him and focus on your future and living your best life. 
200,"Wow, she sounds like a spoiled brat. ""But I dont want *this* one, I want *that* one!""

It's your car and you get to drive your car whenever you want. Theres nothing unfair about it. She needs to be grateful that your parents let her borrow the Buick at all instead of complaining that it isn't luxurious enough."
201,"So he won't let you go see your dying mother..... but he will happily begin to imaginary spend the inheritance from her passing..... when it's not even his money!!!!

What a shitty shitty husband you have. I cannot imagine my husband being so cold and cruel. And this is clearly not the first time he has bulldozed you and what you want. But it's absolutely a hill to die on."
202,"If it would make you feel better, there are semen swab tests you can buy online. No sending away to labs; instant chemical reaction. I only know this from watching Another Dirty Room. I'm not sure how accurate/sensitive they are, although on one episode the stain was very old and still came up positive.

Obviously this doesn't solve the trust and communication issues in your relationship, but it helps give you peace of mind in the short team. I agree with everyone recommending couples counselling though."
203,"Literally quote her the TL;DR. "" X, you become infatuated with guys too fast and your expectations are not realistic. This is why you are constantly being let down. When I called you last week X's hospitalization you didn't even ask how she was, instead you made it about you. Friendships don't work if only one person is ever willing to give support."""
204,"I think it's reasonable to expect a house-sitter, **even an unpaid one**, to keep the house moderately clean (ie, take rubbish out, throw out rotting food, etc), not turn it into a cesspool of filth. You could argue that *you* were doing Lexi a favour by giving her a big beautiful house to enjoy! 

It's up to you whether you try to clean up Lexi's mess or not. But it's safe to say that Lexi has delivered a MAJOR blow to your friendship."
205,"If he’s that much of a “caveman,” then he isn’t cut out for marriage. Or adult relationships in general. 

Sheesh, it’s weird how many guys think “I’m just a caveman/slave to my testosterone” excuses them from the responsibilities of adulthood without removing any of the perks. If anything it’s an argument in favor of their own incompetence. And also bullshit. "
206,It could just mean he supports the LGBT community.   I’d wait for him to take the next step.  
207,"So here's my theory: your husband has been telling his parents lies about you. You going on this trip would expose all of that. That's why FIL jumped to needing to take sides - whatever version of your marital trouble your husband has been telling his parents is a side-taking, we don't want you here, thing. "
208,"Lucky for you, you are 18 and not living under their roof. Just because they demanded something doesn't mean you have to do it. Dating  is normal at 18 and if you want to do it so be it. Live your life how you want, especially abroad at uni, you aint getting this time back."
209,"If you dread the idea of seeing them, it is absolutely ok to ignore them. If you feel your life is better without them in it, then I think you are right to be at peace with that decision. But if you're not sure, maybe you could open the door with firm boundaries and see how it goes.

If you agree to see them, I would be very clear about how you feel. Maybe you don't trust them but you are curious about what they have to say. It is fine to tell them that.

I think the first meeting, if there is one, should be at a place where you can easily leave if you want to. If they seem sincerely regretful about how they treated you and it makes you feel good to see them, then keep the door open. If they start telling you why it was all your fault or something like that, then leave and slam that door back shut.

There is no rush, take your time. I hope they are sincere and treat you well, if you decide you want to give them a chance. But you don't owe it to them, do what you think is best for you."
210,"Whether or not your friendship ends over this is up to him. It’s out of your hands at this point. 

Even if you’d had proof, I think he’s in too deep to accept it. That’s common in abusive relationships. She’s prepared for this - she clearly warned him that someone in your friend group would try to break them up for nefarious reasons, and “nobody understands our love, it’s us against the world, blah blah blah.” In his mind, you just proved her right. She probably “predicted” this exact scenario, knowing there was a chance she’d get busted for cheating. She’s an asshole, not an idiot. 

He may need to learn the hard way that this woman is ruining his life. If you want a chance at being there to help him pick up the pieces, here’s what you need to do: when he comes back, if he’s receptive, sit him down to talk. Backtrack carefully and tell him you’re sorry things got so heated, that if he insists you’re mistaken you don’t intend to argue with him (it’s a hard needle to thread, but do your best). Express your concern for him, but do NOT mention his girlfriend, not once - point out things that you’ve noticed about *him* and *his* behavior (never smiles, seems tired/anxious, etc.). Say that you just want to check in and ask if everything is okay, and you’re only worried that he’s not as happy as he used to be. All you want is for him to be happy, you’re not looking for a fight. 

Basically, subvert the expectations that his girlfriend planted in his head. Digging in your heels on her cheating will only make things worse. She’s counting on you being more invested in being correct than you are in maintaining ties with your friend. Don’t play into her hands. Tell him that you’ll back off of his relationship, that if she makes him happy you’re happy for him, and you’re here if he ever needs to talk. And then follow through on it. His girlfriend will have a much harder time convincing him that you’re the enemy if you do this, and it may get the gears turning in his head. He’s not going to leave her now, and maybe not for a while, but you want him to start asking *himself* if he’s truly happy...and if not, why isn’t he? That question eventually unraveled my last relationship, and it’ll likely do the same for his."
211,"I'd say he should at least go view it. It's likely that the realtor has staged the place and made it look more modern, meaning it'll look and feel very different. Maybe that would make it seem more possible for him to live there."
212,Bahahahahahaha. Thank you for this.
213,"Even if you confront them, which I think you should do, just know that that does not undo the fact that your room mates are irreparably trashy.

"
214,"Think of it as you dating a widow and she wants you to visit her husband's grave with her to find closure, and a path forward in her new life.

I know they weren't married, but the situation is very similar. I think she loves him and he was tragically ripped away from her. She's trying to do the right thing by moving on with her life, but she can't (and shouldn't) just pretend that this past part of her life doesn't exist. I think this is her way of trying to find closure and I think you should go with her. She's trying to ""introduce"" you to him, out of respect I sense."
215,Wtf. That's beyond inappropriate. I think it's time to limit your sister's interactions with the two of you.
216,"&gt; He was a nice guy and we had a lot in common and I thought things would get better.  

People generally have more reasons to get married than this. You don't even ever say that you love him? So it's not that surprising, no."
217,"I dated her, in the long ago.  Or someone very like her.

The thing is, when you're in a relationship like that, often part of you (sometimes a *big* part) knows that the relationship is not good for you and your partner is toxic.  But (for whatever reason) you want to stay with him/her, and so you make justifications for his/her behavior, you dig in your heels when others bring it up, and you deflect in *any* way you can, because to do otherwise is to have the house of cards you have built around you come crashing down.

If she truly is as you say she is, and she truly did what you say she did, *he will not see it* until he is *ready* to see it.  And the more you and your other friends push him before he is ready, the more he will dig in his heels and resist, reject, and deflect, in order to preserve the fragile illusion he has built to allow him to rationalize being with someone no one else can stand.

The more you push him to push her away, the more you'll be pushing *him* away.

In my case, I started dating her in college, and even then my friends tried to warn me about her.  It took me six *years* to eventually figure out what a toxic person she was to have in my life, and four more to extricate myself from her completely.

All you can do is be there for *him*, and to do that, you may have to apologize for what you said, not because what you said was untrue, but because he wasn't ready to hear it.

When he is *ready* to see her for what she is, he will.  But not before, and not because of anything you or anyone else says to him; he will have to see it for *himself*, unprompted.

218,"Tell her that her alarm fuckery is severely impacting your sleep schedule and you would like to work with her to find something that works for both of you. 

One solution could be a fitbit, which has an alarm function that vibrates on her arm instead of using loud alarms."
219,You were not sneaking around. This was an announced guest and your husband was home. It was purely a social visit and was done in plain view. There is not even the suggestion of impropriety here. You did nothing wrong. 
220,"Yup, this is very possible. Old blood stains are brown. Most girls keep their ugliest/stained underwear to wear during their periods "
221,"Aw, poor thing. I'm sorry he's feeling that way when he didn't do anything wrong. :(

Yeah I would say this probably triggered something for him and I'd just be gentle and tell him you're there for whatever he needs. Maybe suggest he call or e-mail his therapist in the interim just to talk about this?"
222,"This reeks of abusive, manipulative behavior. Please eat your meals, don’t end up in the hospital over this."
223,"Uhmmm...you did nothing wrong here. Your friend didn't even say anything disrespectful - just ribbed you about a phrase that your GF knows you hate...so if anything, she should be apologizing *to you* for snooping your phone with no cause and then for overreacting to fly shit...is this a thing that she does on the regular? Hope not bro or your life is going to be long and miserable with this one."
224,[deleted]
225,"&gt; in the grand scheme of things, this isn't a big deal

Actually, it is. This is a seriously disconcerting attitude that your husband is take here. This isn't about $40, it's abour your husband's blatant lack of respect and entitled indignation in response to you being reasonably upset that he used your stuff. To get himself off no less. OP, if I talked to my partner lile this, I would be ashamed of myself. And if I refused to apologize, told her to quit her b****ing and deal with it... I probably would not be married much longer if I remained steadfast in that sentiment. 

I think your husband needs to sit down and calmly  discuss with you precisely what in the living fuck his problem is. The lack of respect here is simply appalling and absurd. When tbis type of behavior is routine it is called abuse - I think you've got pretty reasonable grounds to be upset with him. If he can't offer a heartfelt apology - and replacing the oil would help that apology out a lot as well - I'd be demanding a couples counseling session if he thinks he can act like some punk and get away with it. You either demand your respect or you end up married with none of it."

&gt; Because my income is pretty limited, I can't comfortably afford to rent an office/secondary residence for myself in addition to our rent. I could afford to rent an apartment on my own in our area, but not while also paying our shared expenses.

is insane. It's insane that you, a grad student, would consider it a possibility to spend your own money to rent a separate office or ANOTHER HOME because your husband *demands* that he monopolize your shared home -- for which you pay 50% of the costs even though I expect your income is much, much lower -- all day every day. 

The picture I get from your post is that your husband does not respect you as an equal partner, does not respect your needs, thinks that he is entitled to whatever arrangement he wants regardless of your rights, and that you have internalized his completely lopsided mindset to the point that you think it's reasonable for you to make ludicrous sacrifices to accommodate his selfish preferences.

Again, you are *paying for half of this house he does not think you should be allowed to use*. Why are you okay with a marriage where you are treated with so little respect?"

239,"Just so you know, over at /r/antiMLM, there’s tons of pics of people getting “free” Lularoe because they won a raffle/prize/drawing/etc.

It’s called LulaJail? Basically wives keep buying the stupid leggings after their husbands have told them to stop and the vendor adds a little card saying “congrats! You won!” In there. So if the husband finds the package before the wife gets to it, she can just say she won them! Isn’t she suuuuuuuuuper lucky?! How the hell can she keep up the lie that she’s constantly winning leggings?

Your wife is lying about winning them. And I have no idea how you can track her spending especially if she’s opening cards behind her back. And if she’s so sheisty to be doing that AND lying about free leggings.... I dunno how to ever trust her."
240,"Your husband is childish and is being an asshole. He is going to get shredded by the replies to your post. I suggest you let him read them and ask him of he has any defense to what will be a very through critique of his behavior. 

He is insecure because the doctor told him he is fat. I mean he already knew he was fat but he got so fat the doctor told him to be less fat. That’s no fun. I’m fat my self so I feel his pain. 

He is probably busting his ass to walk as much as he has been. And that’s good. But you seem to walk as much a more just naturally and for fun. So he is more insecure. And nobody likes to feel insecure. 

But his response to his own insecurity is inexcusable. He can’t make you walk less. He can only walk more. And if you get more steps, so what. "

2. Your friend think that he's *not* a confident, competitive, macho man and that's why you are not attracted to him.

Either way, his issue is with you not being into him. Like who you like. Why give a fuck what your dumb friend thinks about it?"

Something like that.

You and your wife need to make whatever sacrifices or changes are necessary to get to marriage counseling. It may save the relationship, or not, but at the least it would make the divorce easier to navigate.

How insulting.  He's not your dad, he doesn't get to forbid you from doing things.  I saw you mentioned in another comment that your friends are married too.

He may have been drinking, but he knew exactly what he was doing, and he's probably done similar things before (because that's an extreme series of acts for a first-timer or for a ""regrettable mistake"").  

I assure you, he doesn't regret his actions. He only regrets that were consequences. Kudos to your company for handling the matter appropriately by firing him (the swiftness of justice here also makes me wonder if he had harassed previous employees).

You didn't do anything wrong. If you hadn't reported it, he wouldn't have wished he could ""take it all back."" He'd keep pushing and pushing to see what he could get away with. You saved yourself a lot more unpleasantness by reporting him when you did, and you probably saved other employees from that same fate, too, and whoever would've held the job after you."

That's the right answer (only answer really).   She hasn't seen this dog in two and a half *years* when the dog was essentially a puppy.   She doesn't want to see the dog, with which she has no real bond, she wants an excuse to see the guy her family members mention from time to time.

274,"Yes, it seems pretty extreme to end a relationship over one comment... but was it really just one comment? Do you talk about other women like that regularly, do you act differently or more sexually when you're with your male friends? Your girlfriend was standing in front of you and you didn't think asking a question about fucking other girls might raise her hackles a little bit? Yeah freaking out over your significant other being attracted to other people isn't cool, but if you're comfortable with making sexual comments about other girls, regardless of whether or not you were just ""trying to get a laugh"" out of your friends, doesn't strike me as very respectful either. 

She might just be looking at it as a respect thing. And her friend was with her. It would def embarrass me if I heard my boyfriend asking a crass question like that, it just really isn't a good look. "
275,"Parents who demand their adult children remain obedient tend to be *very well practiced* (and very skilled) in using guilt as manipulation. 

It’s normal to feel guilty. You’ve likely been taught (via negative reinforcement) that disobeying your parents comes with consequences. When you are under their roof, they can make you very unhappy if you disobey. Now, they no longer have that leverage, but you still associate displeasing them with a scary or bad outcome. 

If they do withdraw their financial support or place any more expectations on you (“switch to a Kenyan school or else” / “come home for Xmas or else” / etc), please remember you are an adult and get to make your own choices.

It’s possible you will not *have to* drop out university, and if they value their image above all else, they may prefer to keep you in school than to bring you back (implying you’re an academic failure or unable to function without them). In that case, you hold all the cards.

I think you should lay it out for him and also tell him how disappointing it is that he can't manage the household he lives in without assistance from his mommy."
281,"You mention your anxiety and nerves and self consciousness a lot. He could be reading that from you as a ""no go"" signal, rather than it being about your leg.

"
282,"My condolences for your loss.

Honestly though, I think you need to just acknowledge she may be there but otherwise let it go. She's his mother as much as she's your grandmother. To him, the mistress is a close relation even if she isn't that to you, and he may very much be turning to her in this difficult time. Please just go and focus on honoring your grandmother.

Additionally reach out to him ahead of time and say ""I am not reaching out to forgive you. I am (e-mailing/texting) because I want Grandma's funeral to be a celebration and honor of her life, not a place to discuss family arguments.

 Decide how often you feel like answering her messages and do not answer them any more often than that. Ditto phone calls. If she comes to your house unannounced, do not let her in.

OP doesn't go into how many times they've had this conversation or why he would disregard her boundaries in the first place... no matter how ""crazy"" or ""insecure"" they are.

There's a lot of ""crazy girlfriend"" vs ""cool girlfriend"" arguments here too.. with ""wow my girlfriend would never do that, she loves talking about how hot other women/men are""... and that's great!

Definitely confront them, it's totally fuckin weird. "
301,"&gt;You told him you are still a virgin and his first thought was to organise a threesome...

302,"This is the best way to handle it. Don't focus on her relationship. That's her issue to deal with. Focus on her actions as a roommate. Keeping you all up until 2 am is unacceptable, regardless the reason behind it.  

Sit her down and tell her if she wants to have calls with her BF she needs to keep it low, none of you want to hear her problems with her bF at 2 in the morning. If she keeps doing it, bang loudly on her door and tell her to keep it down. the fact that you all seem to treat her with baby gloves is probably not helping this relationship. "
303,This relationship sounds terrible. You admit that he is emotionally abusive. That right there is a deal breaker in itself. Full stop. You have been with this guy for less than three years and you are already having to go through couples counseling. The relationship clearly isn’t working. This is a time when you should be getting to know each other and forming a partnership. Just get away from him. Take the opportunity to move out and don’t look back.

309,"&gt; After having spent an entire day studying, when I get home I often leave my phone in my bag and spend some time to unwind with my family or attend to some other things that I need to get done.

It kind of strikes me here that speaking to your boyfriend isn’t a relaxing activity for you. You don’t choose to call him on your drive home, &amp; you spend time with your family to relax before you’re ready to reply to his texts. I’m not saying this to vilify you at all, just to say that I think your boyfriend is a stressor for you instead of a support / stress reliever. It’s totally understandable that you don’t want to interrupt your study time to reply to texts, but needing time to unwind from studying before you’re ready to deal with him is sort of a red flag. I’m guessing that dealing with his depression, when he’s leaning entirely on you &amp; refusing to seek other help, is just burning you out. Are you still getting enough out of this relationship, or do you just feel obligated to stay because he’s depressed &amp; needs you? "

Instead of avoiding, lean into your discomfort. You might surprise yourself!

312,"Can confirm - married a conspiracy nut. 

Later divorced said conspiracy nut.

Conspiracy mentality escalated over time.

As a result, I've had to make critical thinking skills an important exercise for our children. _EDIT: I expanded on this in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9q0gix/my_25m_girlfriend_20f_comes_from_a_very_religious/e86pelt) below._"
313,"It sounds like you two worked this out pretty well, actually. You communicated clearly, and he apologized for both of his outbursts.  

It doesn’t mean you’re wrong to still feel hurt over it.  He behaved badly.  And he isn’t wrong to feel sore from realizing that he was in the wrong.  That’s a real human emotion, and it is natural that he feels that.  He probably also feels some resentment toward you, though it sounds like he’s trying to handle that maturely, which is what people are supposed to do. 

I think you should give it time, and see how things play out.  Don’t hold him to a lower standard, but don’t re-argue things that have been handled.  "
314,"This is really good, thank you. I think I'll try it. "
315,This made me cry. Thank you for your wishes and you are right. I don't want to regret not going. There needs to be some serious changes. 
316,"Girlfriends, parents, and therapists don't suddenly turn on someone and try to sabotage them out of the blue. The odds of your perception being the real one is exceedingly low. The odds that your therapist is trying to steal your girlfriend and your place in the family is 0%. Absolutely not happening. That's not a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Stop worrying about proof or not, and seek immediate help. You literally cannot trust your own perception of events right now. See a new therapist if you need, so you can feel confident they are not interested in your girlfriend, your family, or anything other than helping you."
317,"Him saying wrongfully negative things about you to his friends, regardless of gender, would be a dealbreaker imo. His relationship with her is not a normal friendship. Without a doubt if you break up with him, he'll be crying to her the very next second and dating her the following day. "
318,"Could be off base on this, but it sounds like you set your sights on someone and then settle for less than what you want. You said in your last post your sister ended up entangled with guys you expressed interest in - and I know that feeling and it does suck - but from what little I know here it also seems like you don’t go just go after what you want. If this FWB situation is what you really want and I kinda doubt it, then way to go, could be very fun. But maybe just maybe take your overstepping siblings moves as a kick in the ass and go for what you really want. "
319,"Um, the comment from FIL about how his marriage lasted a long time and not taking sides against his son make me suspect that husband is actively planning for divorce and his parents know it. "
320,What a fucking bizarre and off putting thing to say. 
321,"Please choose your kid. Make no mistake, if you let this dynamic continue, your son is going to hate *you* way more than he hates your husband. "
322,"Go to your Mom. Help your brother. And never count your eggs before they're hatched when it comes to inheritances.

And consider why and how come its acceptable that your husband isnt by your side in this? Id been estranged from my bio father for 20 years when he passed. My SO of 13 years had never met him. But he dropped work in an instant drove me to my aunts house so we could deal with all the things that needed to be done. And he held my hand through it all. I can't imagine going through something like that and my SO not only not being there but calling it a vacation.

OP... you sound so very alone and lonely."
323,"I’m sorry you can’t attend, We will miss you guys at the wedding

That’s it. That’s all you have to say. 

For your parents. They don’t need your wedding to see their granddaughter. If they have enough money to buy his good graces for a chance to see their granddaughter (because that’s exactly what is going on. They’re bending over backwards until he decides to allow another visitation), they can go to him or they can do a power move and say that they won’t help him out financially UNLESS they get to see the granddaughter.

It sucks, and you’ll have blowback from your parents about not inviting the entire family, but it’s not really like you had much of a relationship with your brother anyways."
324,"I appreciate your honesty. He mentioned ""How would you feel if I started seeing someone else?"" and I replied with ""Feels like you already are."" It is very hypocritical, you are absolutely right. He had nothing to say there."
325,"This is one of my biggest all time pet peeves.  She's not a fucking doctor, and this is super controlling.  I *hate* when people interfere with their partner's medication."
326,"Put it this way: **why the hell would you maintain ties with her?!** If this was a friend or stranger acting this way presumably you'd cut yourself off from them with barely a thought - why does family get a pass, *especially* family who's clearly got a history of acting this way? Don't you think that keeping her a part of your life is likely to do **more** damage, not less?

You don't even have to have some grand statement of ""cutting her out"", just stay the fuck away from her as much as humanly possible, and if you have to interact with her keep it cold and polite and around multiple witnesses. She's made it abundantly clear that she's a toxic mess and will make shit up just to cause drama. **She's** caused harm to you and your family by spreading lies, and actions have consequences. ""Family"" doesn't deserve special treatment for behaviour this unpleasant."
327,"She has already acclimated to using the Buick as if it's not even you and your parents doing her a kindness, and is now expecting you to downgrade so she can drive YOUR car. She is being incredibly unreasonable, entitled, and selfish. I'd be very worried about how she's going to behave in the future if she is being this bad over your family doing her a huge favor.

&amp;#x200B;

You coming from a well off family doesn't mean you have to give her better things than you yourself get.

&amp;#x200B;

She's living with you too? Sounds like things have moved very quickly, and she expects to be treated like a trophy wife, rather than an equal partner and girlfriend."
328,"Just start going out/leaving a lot. He says he's going to go play video games, you say ""Cool. I'm going for walk (or to the store), be back later. You two have fun."" And just leave, no discussion about it. He says he's going out with friends, you say ""Cool. Glad you found a babysitter. I'm going out with the girls tonight. Have fun with the guys!"" Maybe even plan some weekends away without him on his parenting weekends, so he learns to parent for himself.

Edit: When I wrote this, I didn't notice the part about his comments on child support. That's gross. Leave him. He really thinks any money his ex spends means she's misappropriating child support? His payments probably don't even cover half the cost of the groceries his ex buys for the kid, or half the cost of living expenses, like the additional rent to cover the kid's bedroom, utilities, health care, clothes, and all that. Mom getting an occasional manicure doesn't mean she's not using child support for the kid. He's an ass."
329,"Is this what you want? Do you think of the billions of men out there this is the best you can do?

You know what to do - leave him. You are way too young for this!"
330,"Why does your mom have a key to your place? Do not give her a key to the new place. You better prepare yourself and your fiance for the possibility that she does move and start shining your spine. Also, visit /r/justnomil for a look at what your fiance is dealing with."
331,"&gt; He apologized, told me that he felt stupid for saying no to going out with me years ago (for about a month, I had a massive crush on him and asked him out, but he said no as he only saw me as a friend at the time). In truth he liked me back. He just didn’t feel that he was ready for a relationship, especially not with someone he cared about so much.

This is the kind of bullshit drama you won't have to deal with with your husband."
332,[deleted]
333,"Honestly, the job thing is an important life lesson for you. Like, you spend a lot of time convincing your friend to even interview your gf. Your friend doesn’t want to because she lacks experience, and you keep pushing them. Your friend finally gives in. Your girlfriend immediately does something a person who’s lacking experience would do.

Take this to heart. It’s risky fucking business recommending someone for a job/getting someone an interview, and sooner or later doing it will put you in a shitty situation. Everyone learns this eventually, and most of the time the cost is high. "
334,"People talk about the ""fight or flight"" reaction, but what is at least as common, if not more so, is the ""freeze"" reaction. What the roommates did was a violation. They exposed the OP to sexual activity without her consent. ""Freeze"" is a very common reaction to something like that - it can be scary - it's gross and violating."
335,"I think sitting her down and telling her something like ""I had been speaking with your father about a plan for this weekend. I was going to propose whilst we were in the mountains and he loved the idea. He knew the whole plan. He even told your mum. I know this is not the perfect time for a proposal, so would you like to see the ring, or shall we wait a little longer?"" would work best. Don't go from ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU PROPOSED YET!"" to ""BAM, HERE'S A RING!"". The most important part is that there was a plan and her dad knew about it. Leave it up to her wether she sees the ring and everything now, or wether you postpone to still have a big proposal. "
336,"I was expecting this to be a 7 or 8 year old kid playing army. A high school student though?? That's creepy as fuck. Get more cameras, preferably some with motion detectors and call the cops anytime this psycho is doing something weird on your property. "
337,"Block her. She is not one of your closest friends. She is literally an internet stranger who is most likely someone who is not who she says she is. Definitely a pedo, definitely someone you shouldn’t consider your closest friend. 

Any reaction your parents could have in this situation, **would not** be an over reaction. She is creepy and trying to prey on you.  "
338,"From what you described your reaction was on point.

Your boyfriend has lots of pain bottled up inside. He's not showing it often because men are taught that showing sadness is a weakness that will be exploited.

Him breaking down in front of you is showing tremendous trust on his part. You do not need to say anything. Just hug him and tell him you love him. That is the best support you can give."
339,"what made me laugh was

&gt;and he says “who said i had to pay you back?”

Like, does he not understand the definition of the word ""borrow""?

&amp;#x200B;"
340,"Take your fitbit off and enjoy your life again! How many steps did you walk? I don't know! Really, it sounds like you get exercise on a.regular basis and don't need a record of it to stay motivated. Hell, strap the fit bit on a puppy and see how your hubby keeps up with that. "
341,I usually dont say this about relationships but... is he really worth it? He sounds very narcissistic
342,"$500 is a lot of money to loan someone, even if that someone is your mother and she has never asked before. If she wanted $5 to buy milk then you'd be way out of line not to loan it without question.

But do keep at the back of your mind that maybe this means something is wrong between your parents. Maybe your father doesn't allow her much control over how money is spent... and maybe that is with good reason or maybe he's just controlling.  Maybe she's doing something dodgy or maybe your father tends to take against her doing even quite innocent things.You don't know, so you should try to see all but say little."
343,"Thank you. Yes, he agreed to not bring the console, so I won't bring it up again. "
344,"Sounds like you should be doing some investigating. Call that number and ask for details. 

OP, i agree, environment can sometimes be unreasonable about not liking a partner. But it sounds like they feel that he's taking advantage of you. Re-evaluate for yourself how okay you are with all you've done for him if it turns out this call is the truth. It might be that this is a prank, but are you okay with all parts of your relationship so far? Sometimes when everyone says 'no', we get blinded in proving them wrong. Maybe check if you missed red flags before and if there are some changes necessary, unrelated to your family's dislike. "
345,"&gt;When I said how unhappy I was he said ""well it's not like all of us get to take 6 day vacations, so maybe don't b---- so much about what those of us stuck at home have to do."" 

&gt;I told him he didn't have to use my lotion and the nice thing to do would be to replace it. He said ""if you didn't want me to use it like that, you should have kept it out of site.""

Sounds like you're married to an asshole. Is this kind of petulant, selfish behavior normal for him? His reaction is way over the line, and that he has the gall to blame you for it is the shit-cherry on the crap-cake."
346,Wow John and your bf suck and so do your friends. Nope do not hang out with him. Don’t torture yourself just to keep friends that half ass the friendship. Might have to start completely over and make some new friends . 
347,"I doubt he even used it as lube as I'm sure a manly man like him wouldn't want his junk to smell all purty. He likely dumped it down the sink.

I think he TOLD her he did, because that's how he tries to tear her down. With his dick. Just like any other insecure little misogynist. "
348,"No. You guys have different goals in life and thats okay. If she definitely does not want to move but you do, it seems logical to say that the relation will end. I think your career is important and if this move is important to you, then you’re making the right decision "
349,"Drugs have a way of bringing people closer together. You turned him down while you were rolling, but took him up days later. The feelings are all yours, not drugs :)"
350,"I'm not going to fault you for asking the question, because I've been around families raised with strict modesty values and I know that this can seem genuinely strange, but it really isn't.  None of the behavior you've described is abnormal.

My son is 14 and if he is sitting right next to me at home, I'll occasionally stroke his hair or scalp because I know if feels good when someone does it to me, and I find it relaxing as well.  Hell, my mom still does it to me if I'm sitting next to her and I'm in my 40s.

And I grew up with 2 sisters and a mother randomly walked around in bra and panties on a regular basis.  Perhaps not just ""hanging out"" that way, but if they needed clothes from the laundry room in the basement, they certainly didn't bother getting dressed to walk down there.  Hell, I was usually lucky when my sister would be wearing a bra instead of just wandering downstairs with an arm across her chest. (looking for her bra)  The only one who was ever uncomfortable about it was me, but that's pretty SOP for a teenage boy who is paranoid about the possibility of getting a random erection while around a ""sister"".

And even given her propensity for walking around nearly nude, my sister still yelled if I or anyone else walked in on her changing.  I assume because of the surprise factor."
351,"Yeah, no, this guy's a creep. You've only been together four months and he's trying to manipulate you into letting him sleep with other women? With such a tired and bullshit excuse? Nah. You're in the honeymoon phase. Him starting this up at four months should be deal breaker. 

This guy doesn't respect you and doesn't feel physical desire for you. That isn't love."
352,"So.. I have two best friends. One (Karen) is gay and was in love with the other (Betty) all throughout high school. Although Betty had a serious boyfriend through most of it, I heard similar agonizing from Karen - right down to Betty changing in front of her and cuddling, etc. Many years later, after a lot of silent heartbreak, Karen moved on. Betty was incredibly jealous and less than subtle about it. Karen was furious Betty couldn't act normal and be happy for her. She distanced herself and their friendship was never the same again.

Now, does it matter whether Karen is bi or not? No. That was the story of someone leading someone on for years with no intention of pursuit. Happens all the time. People like feeling wanted. In your case, does it matter if Diane is bi? No, because it's either a story of someone engaging in an emotional affair or someone looking for that sweet, sweet ego-boost. Which would really be better?"
353,And she's relying on that closeness to make sure you'll feel bad about standing up for your marriage.
354,"Nail on the head.  Our attractiveness changes as we fall in love.  My wife is pretty but she was not my type.  We went out and the more I got to know her the sexier she got.  It was like magic!  I won’t lie to you when I say, 17 years into our marriage, that she is the sexiest woman I know on the planet.  "
355,"Block her number. She wants attention, don't give it to her. "
356,"Nope. Stop talking to these assholes. They're moochers and they wouldn't do the same thing for you either, they'd just whine about you every damn time and make you feel as unwanted as possible, while telling everyone how gracious they are. You know, the same attitude you should be having, except Central European culture doesn't give as much of a shit about your family and the reputations. 

Tell your dad you'll talk to him in March, when he has things figured out with his family. You're not part of any arrangement.

BTW, do inform your neighbours/landlord that if someone comes to ask to be let in, you haven't given permission. The 'long lost family'-story can be endearing, especially if kids are involved. "
357,And he has the gall to accuse *her* of being a gold digger! DTMFA.
358,"Listen to your instinct...the answer is no. Keep in mind that it's usually when you just start talking to someone that your best foot is being put forward. So if this is his ""best foot,"" it only gets worse from here. It's just a guy from Bumble; you don't owe him anything. "
359,"You leave everytime she mentions such a remark. She's green alright, because she's not happy with her life as a mom and wife. It's up to her to change it. 

""Cindy, i like us to be friends, but you seem to be acting out some of your issues on me. It's affecting our friendship. You're not shining brighter by putting me down. We'll try this again another time, when you feel a little better."" Then you leave. Maybe then 2 weeks later you can see if you can invite her again. You repeat this for a while.

Do accept that this friendship might be dying with this. She's on a downward spiral and can't contribute. Plus she'll be mad as heck, cos she considers herself justified to say these things. You can't carry it on your own. If this is how it's going to be, then re evaluate how close you keep her. "
360,“Tee hee hee I have a dark secret I can’t tell you! OwO”
361,"God, it's like crate training a dog."
362,He should have invited you along.  He should WANT to introduce you to them if they are such good friends and if you are his priority.  All i see is a boyfriend without the spine to make it clear to these girls that he chose you and cares about you more.
363,"Communication is so often raised as a major point in a relationship for reasons like this. Currently the biggest issue between the two of you is communication and how it is being manipulated to fit his desires: the desire to avoid it. He is vague and somewhat inappropriate with his humour, using it to soften criticism or derail serious conversations. In turn you are now afraid to ask him the 'big questions' because you've become self conscious about them being 'jokes' and thus questioning whether you are just being a bad sport. And unfortunately the reality is that really only suits him, because that means he gets to continue teasing you while avoiding anything too deep. 

You have to call him out on it. If he is trying to be 'funny' then he is doing it specifically and repeatedly at your expense and that is tiring. Whether he appreciates it or not he is using that tone to control you, I don't doubt he will try and accuse you of being sensitive or not getting it, but just make it clear: you don't really want to be in a relationship where the only communication that occurs is through being cut down all the time, especially where you really do not get a balance of positive feedback. 

Making jokes is fine. But if the only way he can function as a person is by teasing you and avoiding serious discussion is by being facetious then you have to ask whether he is really ready for a relationship at all. "
364,"Exactly. OP treated her the way a bank would, nicer than a loan shark would.

My guess is that her parental ego was bruised, that she was in a position to ask something of her child who then asked her questions that made her explain herself. This is not a typical parent-child dynamic and I suspect she was really uncomfortable and embarrassed by it.

Unless this is a regular occurrence, in which case, smart to not lend money now or ever."
365,"Speaking from experience as another trans girl: 

Based on his initial aversion, him being a bit of a bro, his emphasis of your feminine physical traits, and the fact that you appear to pass flawlessly (and I assume are post-op?), the most likely scenario is that he chose to ignore you being trans rather than process you being trans. 

Alana = girl is not the same as Alana = trans girl = girl. The first one is an easier hurdle for many people. 

Bringing up being an LBGT couple emphasizes column B, and contradicts column A (since, if you were actually a “real” girl, there would be no need for a special label).

It’s silly, but I’ve run into this pretty commonly. You’ll have to sound him out and see how big a deal this is. 

"
366,"I'm VERY concerned about your husband's lack of empathy. His response to you specifically saying you wanted to get a gun and shoot yourself was ""don't do that"". You told him you were literally about to die and he made a sad face and a half hearted attempt to maybe take a day off at some point. You told him specifically that you needed someone to watch the baby even just for a few hours so you could try to get your mental health treated and he did nothing, not even offer to find someone to pay to babysit. Raising a baby is an enormous job and you had one under the impression that it would have 2 parents, and it didn't until he was already 15 months old. The fact that your husband can't understand why you're upset or even take responsibility for his actions makes me think he is not a good guy. Please go to therapy with or without him. "
367,"Call your relatives yourself and let them know your parents don’t work anymore and rent and utilities come out of your pocket, and if they plan on staying for more than a weekend you’ll be needing them to help because it’s simply impossible to support 4 adults and yourself. They will likely stay away hahah "
368,"You've been dating for 6 months, she's not on the lease, and as other people have said it's not her fault you can't really afford your rent. It's not a good idea to move in with a partner for financial reasons alone, and asking her to pay rent is essentially asking her to move in. 

You can talk to her about it if you want to. She might be willing to help you out. But it's probably not a good idea."
369,"I mean, is this friend aware that some women DON'T LIKE MEN AT ALL! And omg! They like other women! Some women don't like any type of person and are asexual. 

""Friend"" needs to grow up."
370,"He could have just said ""I am going through some things and I won't be able to attend your wedding. Unfortunately these things are highly personal and I can't share them with you but I wish you the best and I'll make sure to send you an awesome gift."" He didn't have to selfishly spill his feelings all over you. He's an adult and should have behaved like one. I'd just keep some distance for a while. Let stuff cool down. "
371,"Something to keep in mind is you are probably a safe target to flirt with because, frankly, her Husband is likely not to get upset about it. Quite a few guys have girl/girl fantasies and he may have joked about you two at one point.

You need to focus elsewhere because this is clearly her wanting someone to flirt with that she knows her husband won't lose his shit over."
372,Skip the whole std test step and just divorce him
373,"Your post reads a bit self-centered, sorry to say. Your life goals, your needs, your studies, your plan. He's telling you he's not happy and all I read in this is you trivializing that. You can't just decide his life is awesome and he shouldn't be unhappy. You sound like you have very little empathy for your boyfriend because you're so upset at him for infringing on your life - to the point you find him hurting and in need as ""repulsive"". I'm sure you could rush to your own defense with things you've done for him, or ways you're trying to be understanding, but this is very much how you come across here.

So for actionable things, I think it's 100% reasonable for you to not want to be his sole emotional support. I would sit down with him and figure out what his needs are, agree to something like date nights/quality time a few times a week or always getting some in before bed (or at some routine time he can depend on from you). Make it clear you need to spend the rest of your time between classes prioritizing your homework, and you'll reach out to him if you finish early. Find other compromises, like maybe he can watch tv on his laptop in your room with you while you study. Try to have some patience for him - just because his issues seem minor to you doesn't mean they are to him."
374,"She didn't just want a hug - she wanted validation for treating you like shit when you were younger.  You are oversimplifying her motives and trying to ascribe innocent-ish motives to someone who just didn't have them.  Hell, given her track record, it's not impossible that she was having issues with her husband and wanted to use you to get back at him.  

You didn't approach her and you gave your ex ample opportunity to leave the situation.  She cornered you and you reacted accordingly.  "
375,"Damn, this is some junior-high level bullshit, OP. I think you’re being reasonable by not wanting your boyfriend to go to a party with a bunch of people who treat you like crap, but the decision is really up to him. Hopefully he will support you and stay home. 

Honestly though the best answer is for you to find a new place and move so you can start over with new landlords and neighbors who don’t shun  you for daring to get hurt on the job. I hope you got worker’s comp for that, by the way. "
376,"More like a fin dom (usually ""fin domme""and usually women), I think."
377,"No. 

You have 2 children under 3. You live paycheck to paycheck. 

“I need you to really hear me. I respect and love you and your sister. We simply cannot afford to bring them into our home. It is not an option. We can’t afford it financially; there are too many risks. What I do want to ensure is that we help in some other way; whether we help raise money, or help her find another friend or family to stay with. But this isn’t an option. I know your heart is so big and you want to help. I do too. But we have to put our children first. This isn’t going to be good for them. She has to find another option. I am making it clear to you now: I cannot agree to this. So let’s compromise.” "
378,"If you're so close to Agnes that people have started thinking that you're her partner and not your wife's, then that's a sign that you need to pull back from your friendship with Agnes and reprioritize your wife. Agnes doesn't sound like a really respectful friend for your marriage and honestly, I'd stop any sort of friendship with her and only interact with her if you need to for work. "
379,"I can see the two sides here. On one hand, she was able to handle the situation, and it worked out reasonably well, given the circumstances. And I can understand that she didn't feel it was worth ruining your trip over. 

I can also see your side; of course, I'd want to know if something serious happened to my partner. And now, it's been acknowledged that you'd want to know when something went down. 

To keep holding onto it, or being upset at her being ""glib"" about it though... Come on. She's a big girl. She dealt with it. She very clearly has a sense of humour, and even moreso, is independent. That's not a bad thing. Based purely on the info provided, I do feel like you're experiencing the adrenaline and anxiety of the event late, having found out about it late. She's already on the other side of the trauma, so her glib response is one of a person who has decided to move forward, apparently minus a finger. Give yourself a minute to freak out, but ultimately... Let it go. Shit happens. This isn't the end of the world, it just kinda sucks for a bit. "
380,"I think your wife is right and your previous memories would fade, however they wouldn’t fade completely. You’d still remember what happened there.

It might help her understand your perspective if you go to the viewing with her and she listens to you describe the things that happened with the patient, assuming you can do so without violating privacy laws. It’s one thing to say, “I don’t want to live in this house, I had a patient.” It’s quite another to say, “This is where I they were that first time I had to rush over at night. They were curled up in a cot in the corner, wheezing...” It will be unpleasant, but it will get the point across."
381,"This is one of the weirdest things I've read here, which says a lot. His finances are the least issue right now as long as you don't marry him, but the whole story with bitcoin dude and your BFs overall secrecy is way too dodgy, it does feel abit like a potentially unsafe situation for you. Why is bitcoin dude moving close to your BF? Is bitcoin dude moving in with you? How much of a hold does bitcoin dude have over your BF? What does your BF do during the day if he's not working?

He can have as many secrets as he want, but you don't need to accept it or this insane situation."
382,Not just that you forgive her; that you forgave her decades ago.

386,"You don't need to explain to them why your time is too valuable to waste on someone who isn't worth it. Set a standard,  she has to learn 50 signs on her own before you can consider taking your time to help someone you don't believe is trying to help themselves "
387,"For money??

That's not a friend.

A friend would have asked you first.  "
388,"Youd be amazed at how little most people think about their own and others online secuity. 

Needs to be a high school course now or something. "
389,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if this is their behavior after two weeks they are going to get much much worse. Vs doing the telephone game I would just hold a meeting with everyone there, calmly discuss your concerns and try to find solutions together. This is also a good time to see how they react if they get hostile or don't make suitable changes over the next week I would revisit it again. And if nothing changes give them written notice to leave before they have been there a month.

Also if you didn't have them sign a rental agreement the first meeting would be a good time for that."
390,"Again that’s an excuse. It doesn’t matter if it’s your first relationship or your 100th, your girlfriend has goals and wants and you’re only worried about yourself. "
391,"Seriously. That whole scene sounded like freshman girls giggling about how ~dreamy~ the captain of the football team is. Not like a married man discussing a serious issue in his marriage. I know they're young, but for fucks sake. His behavior is repulsive. "
392,"I heard a great story about a bunch of college guys who dressed up as grannies and brought a door with them. They'd knock on a door, the people would open the door and be confronted... with another door. There was a sign on it saying 'please knock'. They knocked and the 'grannies' would open the door,  compliment their costumes and give THEM candy.

Maybe you and your bf can do something like this together?"
393,"Just don’t engage with them sexually. Ignore it. If they take it too far or in the case of the one who’s like an older sister you can have a convo about how you don’t want to upset them, but you view them as a friend and don’t want anything sexual. It may be a little awkward but eventually I’m sure they’ll get the hint and back off. "
394,"&gt;is my boyfriend clumsy and lazy or is there more to the story?

We'll never know.  Life isn't a fiction that comes with an author to answer all the questions.  We don't get to find out the 'why' - we just have to deal with the 'what.'

&gt;Maybe its time to accept he will not change I guess.

That's definitely for certain.  Or if he can change, it won't be due to you alternately picking up his mess and then nagging at him for it.  He's the only one that can change himself, and he doesn't want to do that (gets stubborn when you ask) so that's that.  You just gotta decide whether you like his other qualities enough to always pick up the bill, or if you don't want to be in a relationship like this.  "
395,"If you check out r/deadbedrooms you will see many people divorcing over it despite having decent relationships otherwise. 

I would definitively have a talk with him about it. Keep your cool and see what the problems are and try to start working on them if he is willing. "
396,Why are those your only 2 options? Why do you want to be with someone so impatient and unable to adapt? 
397,I mean he already admitted he was wrong and apologized. What do you want out of another conversation about it? What feels unresolved to you? 
398,"Your boyfriend may be being needy due to anxiety and depression - that can be really wearing and he sounds like he does need to become open to seeing therapist.

However, what I read here is that you are studying whilst he’s supporting you through school by working a job he hates. What does supporting mean - is he paying all your bills and expenses? Has he contributed to the fact you have very little school debt? Would you be happy for him to work a job he enjoys with far less of an income, or do you ‘need’ him to earn all the money for your goals? Your end goal is to have a family - what does that look like for you? Do you want to be a SAHM or will you work and financially support the family you want?

You’ve had your opportunity to get your ideal education whilst being supported by your partner, are you not willing to give him the same opportunity? The way you say ‘he could work his way into engineering or he could study and get us loads of debt’ suggests you are only happy with him seeking a job he enjoys whilst he’s still bringing home all the money. Which is understandable in one sense but also seems unfair if he has to be the one bringing home the money just so you get what you want (to study/be a mum). I might be completely incorrect with this comment, it’s just what I picked up from your post."
399,"Wait... so, he demanded an excessive amount of money for things which he wouldn't explain then called YOU a gold digger for not giving it to him?  Does he even understand that phrase?


Ideally at 26 he would have his life semi-together at least (not everyone does, I certainly didn't but I act like an adult) instead he sounds like a 13 year old in an adult's body.  Whining, begging for money, and testing you because instagram told him too.  You sound vastly more mature than he is despite the age difference.  Go out and find someone better."
400,"Lol @ ""trying to break up with me. ""

Nah man, she's not trying. She DID break up with you. She doesn't need your permission for that hahah"
401,I think the biggest issue is that you aren’t really committed to anything. All I’m seeing is how you keep dragging your feet on literally every big milestone  in a relationship. 
402,"This is one of the things you will have to deal with when it comes to transition - peoples opinions. It’s probably good you’re getting a taste of it now, so it’s not such a shock when you’re transitioning. 

You have every right to be whoever you are, and that isn’t anyone else’s decision to make. 

I do think, people coming from a good place could just be making sure that you’ve done all research and have understood all that’s involved, because they care about you. 

The fact that a message from a past teacher has made you this upset suggests to me that you should attend support groups and go to more therapy sessions to be better prepared for the judgement. You will have to find a bit of peace and make sure you are as best equipped as you can be, or this will be quite difficult. 

This is not to discourage you in any way, being who you really are is a very brave thing to do, you just have to be prepared for peoples commentary, and know how to disregard it :) "
403,"What? He should be thanking his lucky stars you didn't leave him right away. All you want is an STD test and that's too much for him? You even asked him nicely?! Lol omg! 

It's laughable that he is trying to turn this on you. Is he a narcissist or something? Seriously huge raging red flag. 

You didn't ruin the weekend, he ruined your marriage when he cheated on you. It's very very likely he went through with it or will go through with it in the future. "
404,"One- info diet. Why are your mom's friends blabbing about you? Especially to a guy who obviously has a screw loose where you're concerned? Have a serious talk with your mom about not sharing anything about you and your family with ANYONE. 

Two- Cameras. All the cameras. Perimeter cameras, door cam, dash cams for you and your husband.

Three- Talk to either the police or an attorney to see what your options are. Police likely won't be able to do anything without a direct threat or a pattern of stalking, but they may have some ideas in how to keep your family safe.

Four- Keep a picture of this guy on hand to show your neighbors. Have them notify you immediately if they see him around.

This is scary stuff. I had an obsessed former acquaintance talk about torturing and killing me and my baby some years back. Thankfully nothing came of it. But the important thing is to not panic. If you panic you can't think. Hopefully his fixation cooled since you became a mom and are no longer that virginal, sweet young thang he probably saw you as. Just be aware of your surroundings, take reasonable precautions, and don't let this creep take up too much of your headspace."
405,"Your boyfriend, who you love dearly, is verbally abusive. He's not joking and he's not forgetting. He's calling you that repeatedly *because* he knows that it hurts and humiliates you. "
406,"Absolutely agreed. He knew the lotion was a splurge and special to her and somehow in six days he used the entire bottle of it? 

&amp;#x200B;

It was absolutely intentional."
407,"Yep. I had my best friend write me a letter, asking me to give him a chance, when I first started dating my now husband. I attempted to stay friends with him but it was too awkward for everyone involved. It kinda sucks because he was really my best friend, I miss our conversations. "
408,People do a lot of maturing between the ages of 18-25y old which is why most people don't recommend getting married that young. Your husband is not mature enough to be a husband. Have you considered couple's therapy? It will help with your communication and it might help him determine if he wants to stay or not. 
409,And that is another sign he doesn't respect you and you need to end it. Don't stay in a relationship with a partner who doesn't respect you. 
410,"
I’m sorry you’re struggling. This must be incredibly shocking and upsetting for you. But he’s an offending pedophile, and you have a child. You cannot help him. He needs intensive therapy, not an unqualified friend. He’s not the victim here. If he’s going through hell, it’s because *he put himself there.*"
411,"THANK YOU. Look. If your SO has gained weight, there are healthy and appropriate ways to address it with them. He is not wrong to bring up her weight up and ask her to work on it. 

BUT

That’s not what this guy did. Holy shit. He fanboyed over her sister in front of her. He told her he had feelings for her sister and GIGGLED as he said it. He rolled over and went to sleep while she cried herself to sleep over the state of their marriage. He told her he has not been attracted to her for the entire duration of their marriage. HE SAID HE LOVES HER SISTER. 

This guy is a creep and a jerk. OP, this man does not love or respect you. 

YOUR HUSBAND DOES NOT GET TO RUB HIS SEXUAL FANTASIES ABOUT YOUR SISTER IN YOUR FACE JUST BECAUSE YOU GAINED WEIGHT. 

"
412,"&gt; This is coming from a girl with whom I contribute most (~70%) of our food that we share whenever we go out, had lent her money and recharged her monthly phone plan (not that significant amounts tbh) without asking for anything.

Yeah she is mad because she doesn't get her trip compensated as well.  I don't think it's unreasonable to split the trip costs as you have time to save up for next summer.  Your girlfriend needs to realize the level of generosity you have exhibited and that you aren't going to pay for everything.  Especially for big cash items like this.  "
413,"Your friend should be able to confirm the house was left in the same condition as she found it, which it’s clearly not. That’s the most minimum expectation when house sitting. She clearly hasn’t even been able to do that unfortunately."
414,"If he is such an extrovert, why isn’t he calling his friends and family to talk to them? Giving a speech somewhere or something else? It sounds like he needs attention and an audience and he’s relying only on you to give it to him. Remind him there are other people on the planet for him to interact with, and that you do not have to be the only person he talks to about EVERYTHING. 

Also when he is talking to you all day and throws a tantrum because you finally asked him for peace— that is childish. He needs to understand that his conversation should not be weaponized in any way. That means he shouldn’t be trying to control you with nonstop speeches and OR the silent treatment. Both are ridiculous."
415,"&gt;he defended himself by saying I should be better soon so he shouldn't have to do laundry or dishes as long as we don't run out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry, what?  So he's essentially he should NEVER do a load of laundry or wash the dishes or take out trash??

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It just shattered my image of him to watch him sit on the couch and watch tv and let his mother clean our house for him while our kids entertained themselves elsewhere.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would literally start with this sentence.  You expect him to be an equal partner to you, and he was neither of those things.  He doesn't do his equal share of work normally, and had to call his mom when you were sick.  Ask him why he thinks he shouldn't have to contribute to the household chores?  Ask him why he couldn't wash some dishes and do some laundry while your sick?  Ask him if he thinks that's setting a good example for your kids?"
416,"
&gt;Alternatively, if she insists one having alarms go off for that long, there are alarms for deaf and hard-of-hearing people that are basically vibrating wristbands. You can find them on Amazon, they work with smartphones. A potential compromise. 

This was going to be one of my suggestions... 

The other suggestion was going to be stop beating around the bush and be direct. Sit down with her when you are both in a good mood and tell her, ""Hey, Roomie. I know you told me before that you prefer to wake up over a long period of time with lots of alarms, so I tried my best to accommodate that over the last weeks.  Unfortunately, I've found that I can't get back to sleep after the first alarm at XX time; since I don't need to be up for class/work until XX time, I'm losing X hours of sleep every night and it's starting to affect my studies/coursework/job/grades/whatever. Do you think we can try something different (or a few different things) until we find a compromise that will work for the both of us? Do you have any ideas?""

Most *reasonable* people would be happy to help find a work around compromise that both roommates can live with.

Fair warning, not all people are reasonable.

Story time:

Back in college I had two different terrible dorm room mates.

The first one showed up and set up/decorated the room to her preference... Also ending up taking up 75% of the entire room for herself with how she rearranged the furniture before I ever arrived. Within the first week, she had told me that she was having people over to watch a TV show. As I thought that particular show was utter white girl trash, I vacated our room for the viewing and told her I'd be back in a bit.

When I arrived back at our room (well after the show has finished), she had 15 people crammed into our room, watching another show. There were 4 people on my bed and one of them was using my pillow as a foot rest. As I walked in, there were also several people browsing through my drawers and my desk; they weren't even bashful or embarrassed when I walked in and cheerfully addressed the crowd, ""Hi, guys! I'm wonderwife, Marissa's (not bothering to change her name) roommate. Sorry to barge in; I thought [*trashy, rich white girl show*] was over by now. My bad. Was there something I can help you find in my personal drawers?"".

My roommate piped up and told me that everyone was just interested in seeing how I had set up my space so they can get ideas for their own rooms. I let her stupid statement hang in the air for a moment before continuing on in my cheerful manner, with a bit of a giggle and a quizzically raised eyebrow, ""Well... I put my things in drawers... Usually grouping the same types of things into one drawer... Then I close the drawer... I didn't realize this might be unusual! If any of you would like me to help show you how, I'd be more than happy to come to your rooms and show you how I make it work for me!""

I just stood there with a chipper smile on my face, directly next to ***MY*** tv that they were watching (hard to ignore) until they all became uncomfortable and skulked out of the room. Marissa was seething, but I absolutely maintained my chipper attitude as if I were utterly clueless. I put a fresh pillowcase on my pillow, grabbed my book, and settled in on my bed to read while she huffed around the room in a snit.

She requested a roommate change the next day.

This is already too long, so I won't get in to roommate #2, but she was worse... So. Much. Worse."
417,"Break up with her, the fact that she actually sexted him shows that’s she’s willing to cheat. Get a move on before it hurts you too much. 



"
418,"She’s prioritizing her feelings and convictions over your health and well being (and wishes)

So: do the medicine. No doubt. But don’t let her give you the cold shoulder - you shouldn’t have to be shunned for taking care of yourself for any longer period of time. 

And if you have kids: vaccinate. Sad to say but your wife sounds like she could easily pivot into being anti-vaccination"
419,"No no no, do not put your kids through this. Your kids home will suddenly go from being calm and predictable to bring chaotic and unstable. How do you imagine bedtime going? I have a 20 week old son and I know (and Im sure you feel this way too) that bedtime is sacred and you don't screw around  with that. She has 4 kids who are going to be hyper, running around, making noise, etc. Plus what if she takes her abusive ex back? You cannot put your family in danger like that just because his sister can't get her damn shit together"
420,"He needs a private, enclosed office room. I was in the situation of your husband. I had a room that was my office. I would stay in this room and my wife would try to not be noisy and run the blender or anything if she happened to be home. It worked well. His office could be in the bedroom and HE could be hiding. His excuses are ridiculous.

If he runs a cable to any room, he will have internet access. If he gets a wifi extender, he will have internet access. If he gets the cable company to install a new router location (I have done this, it usually comes free with an install, if you are renters it's trivial to get permission) by putting a cable jack into the external wall of your choice - he will have internet access. This is not a roadblock to what he wants.

He is being a bully.

All this being said, it WOULD irritate me when my wife was loud and impacted my Skype calls. I made an effort to move to mitigate this, but general kitchen sounds would disrupt my concentration. We had a degree of compromise."
421,The real questions are... Why don't the in-laws want you around? Why would your husband side with them?
422,"It’s only been six months and it’s clear this guy is a selfish, abusive ass. He doesn’t listen because he doesn’t feel like it and does not care how you feel about it. Jump that ship and RUN."
423,"&gt;He said he couldn't handle staying just friends with me and that if I started seeing someone else it would crush him

lol you mean like a guy straddling you/kissing your cheek/putting his hands all over you??
this guy is a piece of shit. he's a hypocrite and still doesn't respect you at all. tell him to get fucked."
424,"this to me sounds like the opposite of savoring life.


If someone is letting food get cold when they're hungry to go re-arrange their house I'm thinking neuroticism and control issues. Not Happy-go-lucky. If they're eating alone because they'd rather do their own ritual I'm thinking ego-centrism and compulsiveness, not loving and giving and living life to the fullest.. 


&gt;He has had coworkers be pretty rude about it and make it a character attack on him, and he takes any time-related criticisms extremely personally as a result


Duh, if he's not finishing stuff in time that *is* a character fault. Unless they can blame it on anything else how are they supposed to call him on it in any way that is not personal?



All I hear is you being depricating about your own, completely normal, sense of time (not a sense of urgency by the way, you're just a normal functioning adult) and both of you trying to say that what he's doing is normal. He takes time related criticisms personally? Then he should stop being late to things and start watching the time!



He can't both be loving and acts-of-service goodness and then make people wait around for his selfish needs. 



What he's doing is annoying as heck. And if you ever want kids that's not going to happen with someone with this personality.



This will also only annoy you more and more. And unless he fixes it it's going to cost him his job too.


&gt;Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?


This all comes down to his priorities in life and he just places a higher priority on himself than on the time of others. 


Unless he wants to change there's no trick to make him change. And stop with the ""His culture just values life over time bit"", that's a borderline racist 'savage comes to the west' attitude. Dude's 30, he either has to want to change now or it's just not going to happen. 


Mind you, I'm not saying he's *wrong*. If this is incredibly important to him then so be it. There are people who live their life this way. But I would go mad. His coworkers are getting mad. And it sounds like you don't like it either.


There's a reason you often see people who live like that in solitary fields of work with very similar partners. Time isn't something we culturally made up, it's not a vague concept. When people are late they actively ruin plans and take away time others could use to enjoy life themselves.. "
425,"&gt;he was unwilling to break off his friendship with her for our relationship

Sorry if this comes off harsh, but it sounds like you're a post-divorce rebound relationship for him. He won't exclude the ex from his life until he *truly* gets over her, which he's not, because having a rebound relationship is part of his *getting over* process.

By the way, you do NOT sound stupid. I would feel exactly as you do. However, the only way I see this relationship playing out without you getting hurt if by keeping things casual and completely detached. Can't put a square peg in a round hole, ya know?

"
426,"It's so good you opened up communication with your mom and your brother. It's good you both were able to spend time with each other. I'm really happy you chose to communicate; that's so important. 

Best of luck in the future. "
427,He thinks talking a romantic trip with just the two of you right after getting married is a silly tradition?
428,"It sounds like she's socially isolating you. Especially becuse of this:

&gt;Me meeting with a friend of mine of 15 years, even if it includes her boyfriend that I am also friends with. This is the major cause of problems - made worse by the fact that my friend and my gf don't like each other. We used to meet 1-2 a month, recently it has been once 2-3 months.

She's started to not let you see even married couples, even as a double date. I think you've been way too generous in accomodating her and have gone way past half way."
429,"You say that the patient's death didn't affect you, so what about the situation is making you hesitate about buying the house? It's not necessarily unreasonable for you to be reluctant, but your wife needs a clearer picture of why you don't want the house before she can be comfortable agreeing with your decision. If you can articulate what's bothering you, you'll have a much easier time either convincing your wife or working through the issue and accepting the house as a good purchase. As it is right now, your answers are too vague to give you any kind of direction."
430,"&gt; We caused a scene on the city street yelling at each other, and James tried to walk in the opposite direction multiple times before I dragged him towards me and told him to not leave me on a city street at night by myself.

I know you're not asking this, but this is not normal and probably needs to be the focus of your therapy together.

What you are also asking is nothing that you can do.  It's on him.  He's a 31 year old man.  He needs to grow up...but I don't know that you can make him.

I know you don't want to break up, but don't buy into the sunk cost fallacy.  However good you think the rest of the relationship is, screaming at each other in public is very very bad.  Life's too short to waste time with someone whos not changing for the better."
431,You are in exactly the same position as you were when you posted the first time.He wants you as a plan b until his true love comes round.You know you can’t live like this.He will never be happy with anyone else and she will destroy any relationship he tries to build.
432,"if you respond to someone after 80 tries all you have taught them is it takes 80 tries to get a response. just rise above. don't vaguebook about her, don't engage, don't stoop to her level, and if people ask directly, just say with kindness that you two are no longer in contact and that's that."
433,"\&gt;  he said she and my dad will continue paying for my tuition, 

You really knew how to play them. "
434,"Good show, but yes, very addicting.

Cherry took basically an entire month off at her job. I don't know how she did it. No one knows how she did it. We're not sure if she still has said job because someone heard from Adam that she's looking for a new one that would give less hours. She told me at the wedding that she did and was excited to go back to work, but she's lied before.

I'll look more into if anyone's actually seen her in person since the wedding. We all live a good distance away from where she is, but surely someone must have tried visiting at some point. "
435,"My ex-husband did this to me after we got married- he started by cutting out my best friend, then the rest of my friend group (they ""made me too happy""), then my family, etc. It ended with him assaulting me and holding me hostage.  
Tell someone (you mentioned her dad), now."
436,"Tell anyone who asks that you're really worried about your mother's mental health, and she's been saying lots of weird things lately.

Then whisper that there's a history of dementia in the family, and ask them to pray for her.

If they'll believe one rumour, they'll believe another, and that's on them."
437,"This doesn’t really sound like a question. You said yourself multiple times that you’re miserable. You shouldn’t be with someone who makes you miserable.

You’re engaged. What made you get engaged to this woman? What has fundamentally changed that took you from excited to put upon? It sounds like in moving in together, you discovered things about her that weren’t apparent in separate spaces.

This involves a conversation between you two when neither of you are angry in a neutral space. If, after that conversation, you still feel there’s no saving this, then you need to make action to move on."
438,"&gt; Second, I really wasn't ready to have this conversation.  

I don't get this. If you absolutely want or not want children, it should be your first question almost. Don't waste 7 months. Don't grow emotionally invested. 

I don't want any and I'd not even start dating unless I knew he also wants to remain childfree."
439,"You are not his girlfriend. You are a space filler, a time passer until the one comes along. "
440,[deleted]
441,"&gt; Whether or not you want kids is a discussion to have as early as possible

I agree. My wife and I had that conversation about a month into dating, because we didn't want to waste the other's time if we didn't agree on that.

It's a fundamental aspect of a relationship. My wife and I are 100% in agreement that we want kids, and the fact that we knew that early in the relationship meant that we knew that we would be compatible in that respect.

If you aren't compatible on that question, one of the two of you *will* be resentful somewhere down the line, either you for missing out on having children while it was still biologically able, or him for being stuck with a massive responsibility that he never wanted."
442,"&gt;“But I’m your husband— you should always want to have sex with me! Is it the way I look? Are you upset with me? Aren’t I good enough to have sex with?”

So he's doing everything in his power to turn you off, basically. I mean who wants to have sex with a whiny, entitled, insecure, guilt tripping jerk? When he does that, ask him why anyone would want to have sex with someone doing that. He's being really gross and the intervention of a sex therapist might be necessary. "
443,"&gt;  Based purely on the info provided, I do feel like you're experiencing the adrenaline and anxiety of the event late, having found out about it late. She's already on the other side of the trauma, so her glib response is one of a person who has decided to move forward

Yeah, I think you're right. She's just cruising around like normal, making plans for fun stuff to do while she's out on disability. And I'm still stuck on 'HOLY SHIT YOU HAVE NINE FINGERS NOW.' 

Your comment made me feel better. Thank you!"
444,right? he hadn't even booked anything or purchased tickets - he just had it in his mind that he NEEDED to travel at this point and that his new job NEEDED to accommodate him. I have cancelled trips and eaten deposits based on getting new jobs. This is just ... silly. 
445,"Change a job ASAP, or if you can't do that just learn to ignore him. 

And in the future, stay away from any kind of romantic involvement at work. "
446,"&gt;A lot of you were also scarily accurate with regards to his behaviour after I left.

Abusers follow the same patterns so often that it's almost like they all went to the same abuser school - or they're all suffering from the same mental illness, more likely. If you haven't read *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft yet, you should."
447,"For the food specifically, I would just group text a house rule that any food not put away overnight will be thrown away the next morning. 

The other stuff is harder without wrangling a time for her to actually sit down and talk to everyone. Someone who thinks its ok not to wipe up drops of blood from the toilet isn't going to magically change their standards without a major intervention. "
448,"Jesus! Who brings a console to a vacation?

Like why? **Seriously, in big bold letters**

#WHY?

I enjoy playing video games as much as the next guy but the truth is that video games are meant to be at home instead. 

If you have a portable video game system or an emulator on your cell phone, you can play with it on your downtime. However, when you are vacationing with your girlfriend, your girlfriend is obviously way more important than your video game console.

I mean, context is appreciated but flipping out over a video game kinda makes (and assures) that your boyfriend is immature. I think you need to look retrospective and re-examine your boyfriend's maturity.

Seriously, video games are not that important.

It's not always **about the game.**"
449,You weren’t ready to have this conversation because you’re in the “negotiation” phase where you are still familiarizing yourself with all your “quirks”? Never wanting to have kids is not a “quirk” and is not something that should ever be “negotiated.” 
450,"Several things stuck out to me as extremely concerning. 

""I make sure to inform my husband what I'm doing any time I leave the house."" Seriously? You are an adult. You have children. Do you tell him when you're going for a walk? Going to the grocery store? Going to a doctor's appointment? This is so so so controlling.

""From the moment he knocked, Pete looked upset. I knew this would start a fight."" This isn't okay. If you can read on your partner that instantly that there's going to be a fight you've had too many fights. This sentence just reads so apprehensive and exhausted to me. Read your words. Realise how poorly your husband is treating you. 

""he sends me a text apologizing about making me feel that way"" Holy shit this makes me furious on your behalf. This is textbook narcissistic behaviour. He's apologizing for making you feel angry, not about HIS behaviour. He is shifting the blame when he's the one acting like an asshole and you are the one who has been wronged. 

""Pete also told me to stop texting him and I am destroying our marriage and will seek divorce if ""I keep it up"". Then said I look for issues weekly to fight with him about and brought up old unrelated issues we both apologized and put to rest forever ago. He came home and refused to speak to me. He went to bed and didn't even look at me. Again. I feel like a punished dog."" 

You have a right to be treated like a person. Someone who loves you, even if they are mad, will treat you like a person. I've been mad before and not wanted to talk to my partner until I calm down and I tell them that! What your husband is doing is trying to shut you down and make you apologise to HIM so he starts treating you better. Don't put up with that shit. 

As for the ""keep it up"" line, god that's just revolting. He's treating you like a child. He's threatening you with divorce for standing up for yourself. Do you want him to do this to your children? 

This is all abusive. He makes you feel like you can't believe yourself over and over. If you bring up an issue he just ignores it or shuts you down. If you have a real problem with his behaviour he turns it around to make you think it's your fault. He ignores your life and your problems. He tries to keep you from having a social life (whose idea was the move?). You are being isolated and trapped at home with kids. 

Please please please find someone to help you get out of this situation. Your husband needs to completely change, or you need to leave, or you are going to end up the wife who flinches when there's a tiny problem. You have to have seen abuse in media where the abuser says ""I'm so mad you're making me do this"". You are not in the wrong here."
451,"First off you are in an unhealthy relationship with a coworker. Your friendship is way too close. 

You gotta focus on you and your wife. 

That is the important relationship. Angus isn’t family your wife is. 

Your wife is honestly being a saint about your friend. Most wives would not have any of this.

Angus is using you as her emotional significant other. It seems like she’s working her way towards a physical relationship with you. This is bad. 

I don’t think your ideas go far enough. I would cut down on lunches at work with her/commuting together. Also I wouldn’t reply to texts very quickly and if you do keep it short. Only hang out with her with your wife there.

It helped when they got him this huge sort of clock/sand glass timer sort of thing, where he could visibly see time passing. Not sure that is helpful for your situation, but it could be an idea. "

*She* is the one who is ruining your friendship. You shouldn't have to ask her for this kind of common courtesy anyway, but blaming the end of the friendship (if it comes to that) on yourself for simply asking to be treated with respect is so wrong it hurts.

&gt;Other than this, she’s honestly a great friend

You made the right call. "
479,"Reassure her that getting it checked out doesn't mean you're forcing her down a path to chemo or other treatment she doesn't want to do. Actually you're just trying to rule out the worst case scenario. It could just be a benign lump or cyst requiring no further action as originally suspected on her previous visit. For the peace of mind of both of you it would be good to find out rather than live with this fear. 

If it does turn out to be malignant then she does also have the option of not hearing her prognosis. If she'd rather be in denial about her future and not seek any treatment options then she's within her rights to do so. Make sure she knows she's in control and that finding out isn't going to change reality. 

Of course having treatment or not would be her choice. But if it is something malignant then her available choices will dwindle over time. Maybe you can convince her to talk to a counsellor or someone about her fears regarding getting herself checked out. The sooner she goes, the better the outcome can be. "
480,"Nothing is worse than lies and deception and you'll need to decide if you can live with her betrayal but I wanted to offer you some info about LLR/ MLM's and why this happens to people who do not necessarily mean to get in as far as they do. 

Firstly, given the sums of money I would say that she was sucked into buying a retail package, my understanding is that they are between $5k and $7k. 

Why would she do that? 

1. The pressure to recruit is tremendous, she needs to eventually admit she was duped and she needs to stop but in the lead up to this purchase I promise that one or more people made her feel like she owed them this, that she had to do this for her family and she succumbed to their pressure because in order for their ""business"" to succeed that is what they have to do to friends/ family. 

2. They all lie. All the time. They lie to others about how much they make (fake ""payments"" and photos of commissions etc, in most MLM's fewer than 1% make good money), they lie to the people they love (they manipulate and try to get other to fall down the rabbit hole so that they can justify their spending further, but they also actively encourage lying to their husbands), they lie to each other about how exclusive the clothes are and even how good they look (they are not that great looking and fitted clothes look best on most bodies, particularly bigger ones, tents are no one's go to fashion statement). Corporate lies to its sellers about success and creates a cult like atmosphere quite deliberately, they have roots in very dogmatic organised religion, it is not a healthy situation to be in. Again she needs to take responsibility for this but coming out of the FOG will be tough, almost as bad as if she were literally addicted or in a cult. The lies are deep, part of the culture deliberately, and multifaceted.

3. They target mums, they use mum guilt and they bend it to hurt whoever their victim is. They are filling her head with promises of quitting her job to be home with your child full time, with being so successful that you can quit your job. With being a successful business woman, with being empowering to women (while exploiting them and paying them literally nothing for their time), with the gift of their friendship, until she quits of course then she will be dead to them. Do any of these things seem like a dream your wife has? Because I'd guess at one or two being her personal pressure points.

My suggestion is to ask someone to baby sit and put every single box you can find in a pile in the lounge so the scope of the problem is visually apparent. 

Ask her to tell you about what she has done, see if she can admit it I think she will struggle and will try to down play it, but she must start being honest somewhere. If you can, try to remain calm. Minds do not usually get changed through shouting and harsh words. Focus on how the environment she was in normalized lying to you and that you know that deep down she doesn't want to keep doing that (hopefully you know that to be true of your wife). Use the emotions they have been exploiting to help bring her back. Talk to her about the impact on her family, on how you and your child are being negatively impacted. It's a lot and might seem like a guilt trip but I genuinely believe you'll need to bring in the big guns to fight this, I think she is in deep and drowning/ lost. It is not your job to rescue her but if you want to you need to help her find a way back through love.

If you want to stay in this marriage talk to her about the honesty and integrity that she needs to gain back and discuss how she can do that. Talk to her about what she needs to do to find her way back. I would suggest counselling, perhaps someone who specializes in addiction. She needs to be responsible for her behaviour but you don't have to make her do it all on her own, you can offer her the level of support and encouragement you are comfortable with to make it happen. 

The chances of recovering the money she has spent is very unlikely but perhaps try to off load it to other people in her network for reduced prices to at least get some back. I would say that you or a trusted friend is best to do this rather than you wife as I personally believe that she will struggle to do so. 

Google Elle's Poonique story and reflect with her on how similar the story is, the pressure and the way they do this is very deliberate. It doesn't absolve her of responsibility but it does make it more understandable when people fall for it. Sometimes it's hard to admit when you are wrong, especially when it almost costs you your family. 

Millions around the world fall for these schemes every day and they honestly should be illegal, but the owners have lots of friends in the kind of circles that make incredibly unlikely. 

Best wishes. Feel free to PM, I talked a friend around about 12 months ago after she lost her house to an MLM."
481,"As a scuba diver, breathing underwater is actually much more realistic for me 😂😂

That being said, I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but you’re right - she’s not being respectful of me, it’s probably her boyfriend who she let’s walk all over her, and it might come down to ending our friendship. 

Right now, her reasoning is that she wants to go on double dates with her boyfriend, me, and the brother, but I’m sure that’s not the only reason. 

I’ll set more boundaries and see if that helps. Other than this, she’s honestly a great friend. I know that a cliché on this subreddit, but I think her boyfriend has just gotten into her head."
482,"No, do not let it go. The kid is at the perfect age to correct behavior like this. And frankly, it's more serious that he's doing this alone, because kids usually get into trouble when they are in that ""pack mentality"". That kid needs to know he will go to jail if he continues to behave in this manner. Definitely turn in the note to the police as well, and mention the behavior of the younger child, so they know what kind of people they are. You do *not* want to send a message to these people that you will just lay down and take it. "
483,Someone who locks themselves in their room is not ready for an adult relationship let alone marriage.

But when her previous boyfriend got with another girl who was pretty good looking, all of a sudden she was like ""why am I with someone who looks like a toad?""  I didn't think he was attractive either but it suddenly got harsh when she got jealous.  Mind we were like 19 or 20 at this point, it was super childish."

That is actually code that she is banking on you changing your mind about marrying her in the future. If you know right now that you dont want marriage with her in the near future, you need to leave her so she can move on. "
502,"I feel for the guy. He’s grinding hard at a job that he hates, all to support you in obtaining your dream career and focusing on a future still two years distant. He’s carrying the weight of the relationship at the moment. 

I understand why you are upset, at the same time. It sucks to have someone want to veer off the path and pull the rug out from under you. 

However, do you give him credit for all that he’s doing for you? From the tone of your post, it doesn’t sound like it to me. You are so focused on your own goals that you don’t see what this is costing him emotionally. You get snappy with him when he asks for your attention and resent him for being frustrated with a life you deem to be very good. 

Look at it from his perspective - he feels trapped and staring down the future, he can only see himself getting more boxed in. After you are done with school, then it’s taking on the responsibility of a house. After that, kids. Things that tie you down to your choices with big huge knots. It’s scary, particularly in your late twenties. 

What I’m saying is that I think you both need therapy. Him to confront what’s bothering him and for you to help you see his point of view and be more sympathetic. "

I don't say that to criticise you or belittle your relationship, but to me, that's not the way someone 100% committed and in love with their partner talks. Like, there is nothing that could keep me from being with my husband, and if something happened that forced us to be apart, it would be heartbreak and devastation rather than ""not thrilled"". Maybe that will change some day, how knows, but if it does I think that will be a clear sign to me that our relationship has run its course.

It's only been a few hours. Since this brings up bad memories and feelings for him, he's naturally going to be emotional about it.

Worry more if he's still like this in a day or two, but after you've made your feelings clear, stop poking him and don't force him to touch you if he doesn't want to.

510,"My question is, what does “being on the same team” mean in this situation? How is OP supposed to be on his “team” when she doesn’t know the rules of the game, or even what sport she’s supposed to be playing? 

Me ex also used to say vague shit like this in order to make me the bad guy and excuse his bad behavior. Whenever I asked for clarification, he’d respond with something like, “You’re smart, you should be able to figure it out.” My ex was also highly manipulative and emotionally abusive, and only with time and distance from that relationship did I realize that this was a tactic he used to silence me. 

I’m not saying that this is also true of OP’s boyfriend, or that this is what he’s doing, but getting into a screaming match with your SO in the middle of the street is not, in my view, indicative of a healthy and respectful relationship. "

Your parents on the other hand probably had a lot more to do with your brother’s suicide than you give them credit for. Where was all of this rage when your parents were being cruel to their son?

I lost my father to suicide and as much as it sucks, it was my father’s life and my father’s choice. I miss him so much, but if I found out someone helped him get a gun it would make no difference. My dad pulled the trigger because it was what he wanted to do. 

If Tim is normally a loving, considerate person and you believe that he knew your brothers pain and wanted what was best for him then let it be. Are you really going to try and ruin Tim’s life over your brother not wanting to live his?"

517,"I don't think that she is necessarily being manipulative. You've got to be a pretty good actor to be able to cry on demand, even pretty good actors struggle to do that. 

When I was younger, I found it really hard not to cry when I got into arguments with people. I don't know why and I didn't have much control over it. It certainly wasn't nice to experience as I felt horribly out of control and I was glad that it seemed to go away as I got older. 

My suggestion would be that when you do need to talk about something with her, just keep going but give her the chance to get over the crying. When I struggled with crying, I found if someone just gave me a few minutes to relax I could carry on the conversation no problem. It was when they were in my face that I couldn't get it together. I personally didn't like people being in my personal space when I was in that state, but it depends on the individual. 

If she struggles to talk things out, it might help if you ask her to write down why she feels the way she feels and why she took the decision not to go to the interview. 

I think you also need to have a think about your role in your relationship. I don't think it's your place to try and get your girlfriend a job. I think that by doing that it might be infantalising her and stopping her from getting on her own two feet and doing that herself.

I can totally understand your concern about constantly being reminded of work. cooking at night and suddenly remembering filling up syringe drivers on the counter. or watching tv on my sofa and looking over at the corner where the hospital bed sat. i wouldn't be able to feel like i could settle down that plus watching way to many horror movies would probably make it a no from me.

However I can also see the flip side that if it was a nice case and the patient passed comfortably and the family was kind it might also be nice to fill it up with love and life again. maybe painting the walls and changing the carpets will help and once you put your own stuff in the home you might feel differently you're also young and might spend a long time in this house, it may slowly start to feel more and more like home as you grow in your relationship and maybe start a family the memories of who owned it before will fade and you will have new memories to replace them with.

But I really do feel it boils down to how much of a hard limit this for you. If you can articulate to your wife why this isn't good for you mentally and can explain yourself then I feel like that's enough of an excuse to not want to live somewhere. There are plenty of reasons people say no to perfectly good houses and they are always valid. There will be other houses."
521,"I’ve known my husband for 20 years and he has never once said anything to me like the absolute poison your boyfriend has spewed at you. 

My husband isn’t a unicorn. He’s a normal dude - most dudes will respect you for being such a dedicated, hard worker, will support your dream for a better future for yourself, and will not even be capable of thinking up things like “maybe you should be a prostitute” or “you’re poor so you better learn to treat your future rich husband right.”

I mean, my god. The only way any of this makes sense is if you told us your name was Belle, his name was Gaston, and you lived in an 18th-century French village. And even Belle wised up and ditched Gaston."
522,"I use an app called Alarmy. I set the alarm with a picture of the inside of my bathroom, and the alarm won’t turn off until I get up and show the app that I’m in my bathroom.

And I do mean that it *won’t turn off.* There’s no snooze function. Can’t close the app, because it’ll re-open. The app seizes control of phone volume, so you can’t turn it down. Nothing works short of turning off the entire phone — if you want the alarm to turn off, you have to get up and meet the app’s requirements.

For me, it’s either this app or like 5 alarms, because Morningtime ElephantTeeth will turn all her alarms off and go back to sleep without even remembering doing it."
523,"I got a text saying my husband was a father of twins and to tell him to stop ignoring the lawyer letters.

It was an ex-fling who was stalking him and she had created a fake profile. As a probed her for more proof she blocked me and I never heard anything about it again. 

When I confronted my husband initially he didn't recognise the profile. We sat and worked it out and realised the dates didn't even work with the supposed ages of the kids. So we knew it was fake. He didn't walk out I guess because he realised it was important to clear his name for the sake of our relationship. "

525,"NO NO NO NO NO !   


GET OUT OF THERE!"
526,"Kind, normal boyfriends don't think that in any situation that they need to physically correct or reprimand you."
527,This is so wholesome and cute. In approx 10 years if the relationship works out he should propose in unicode. But for now they should just enjoy being dorky high - schoolers who are into each other. 
528,"He was 28 and got together with you when you were 17, he dumped you but still uses you as a girlfriend, and is controlling about your body.  Op....this is an incredibly unhealthy situation for you and you need to get away from him.  He will ruin you.  He is not a good person for you.

And yes...cut your hair.  It's your own damn hair."
529,"This is really concerning - there are so many actions here that are raising red flags. If I were you I would gather up a few friends or your boyfriend, hop in the car and make some calls on the way. Contact everyone you can think of - her family, her coworkers, her other friends - and check to see when the last time anyone heard from her was. If she has any social media you could try to find people to contact that way. 

I know it might feel weird and you probably don’t want to seem like you are overreacting, but I think it’s better to feel a little silly because your friend was really safe and just upset with you than to feel devastated because something happened to her. 

I’m so glad she has a friend like you who is so worried about her - I hope you can find her safe and sound. "
530,"First off, communicate. Tell him you are not okay with him going ahead and making plans when you didnt give a clear no. Then tell him no, you dont want to have sex with him or his fiancee. If he gets angry or combative drop the relationship. "
531,"You are in an exceptionally bad relationship with someone who does not treat you well. He is not good to you. You say you feel loved and protected... except during all these times when he is making you feel VERY not loved or protected.

Acknowledge the fact that this guy is not nice to you. Please. Don't build a life on this foundation of disrespect."
532,"Lol so he cried a little, sulked a little and *still refuses to place any boundaries on this friendship*. 

That’s all you need to know. It would be one thing if he said “look, I’ve known this person for years and I can’t cut contact but I will ensure I cool communication more, and i can ensure nothing like what happened the other night will ever be allowed to occur again” then you could move forward. He didn’t. He literally whined a bit, made you feel like he understood and *didnt move an inch*. Nah. I’d be out. He really loves the helpless act. 

“I’ve tried exactly nothing, and I’m out of ideas!”"
533,"Ignore her, obviously. She didn't cause a scene yet, she was just trying to get under your skin. Don't let her.

&gt;Though our relationship had also been brief at the time, I’ve gotten over the mistakes we had made at the time. 
Shortly after they had broken up...

So...you got with him (""briefly"") while they were still dating? No wonder she's still upset enough to want to bother you. She doesn't need to be hung up on him to still feel some anger, or to want to make you doubt your own relationship with a past cheater. Again, the thing to do is to carry on your own prerogatives and to not worry about her or the past. Presumably you've made your own peace with the cheating, so just hold onto that and have fun at the wedding."
534,"I think the best you can do stand up and take the good thing and leave the bass behind.

Write a letter to him, tell him your feelings about it, your feelings to him, your feelings you wanna forget and the feeling you will keep, then accept what he have done, accept your self for any blames and bad feelings about it. Give it a good goodye  write anything you think are a good way to letgo, seal it up, write his name, kiss it, burn it, whatever you feel is the right way to give it to him a leave it all behind.

I hope you are well and you find your way to heal."

536,"House sitting means keeping the house in order.


She's made things worse then they'd have been if noone was there.



Ofcourse you confront her, this is a pretty fucking heinous thing to do in someone else's home. 


She's 23, not 16. There's no misconception here. Especially as she apparently had her boyfriend over.. If she's old enough for that she's old enough to get that you need to do dishes and water plants. "
537,His friends don’t know and I imagine they might give him a hard time about it because they’re a bit of the “man-bro” type. His family don’t either although he says it’s unlikely they’d have a huge problem with it since he has  “a lesbian aunt everyone loves”. 
538,Wow. You can’t even take responsibility for your own mistake and somehow have to flip it back on her for telling you to follow your gut. This is why she is breaking up with you. 
539,"Okay, well I read all the comments and I noticed you keep brushing that aside as no big deal. You keep saying things like “we’re still intimate” and such but that is not the same thing. At all. 

You commented numerous times about this big move you two made for his job. You keep insisting you don’t resent that but your comments say otherwise. As a matter of fact, you use that move as an excuse for not having sex (I moved for him, gave up my home, job, family and now I have to work 2 jobs so I’m too tired for sex) when a simple, “I work 2 jobs so I’m tired” would’ve done. In your many comments about the move, you mention the sacrifice you made etc etc as though that gives you some kind of free pass or something. He shouldn’t want sex *or* a divorce because you moved for him.

You aren’t being honest about the move and how you really feel about it, that’s for sure.

As far as the sex, do you ever initiate or do you let him do that? Does he ever get to feel like you are sexually attracted to him? That you want him? How often do you turn him down when he does initiate? And by ‘turn him down’, I mean any initiating he does that doesn’t end in actual intercourse. It may not seem like it to you but 5 months without sex for anything other than a medical reason is a really long time. Especially if it seems like there is no end in sight.

I dunno about the email, but I think you need to do some soul-searching here and really be honest with yourself about just how much you’ve put your marriage and your husband’s needs on the back burner. Once you’ve come to terms with that, sit him down and tell him. See where it goes."
540,"For fucks sake OP divorce your wife. Staying together for the kid(s) never truly works out, it just leads to kids growing up with two depressed parents. You are still very young, you have a lot of dating options. "
541,"I don't know man, I'm glad you're happy but I'd be extremely wary here. It's convenient that she's telling you everything you want to hear after blatantly talking about how sexy another man is and explicitly saying she has a crush on him. Even if she ""didn't mean it that way,"" I'd still find that wildly disrespectful. That plus the fact that she's cheated before...just keep your eyes open and don't let your infatuation blind you. Good luck."
542,Agreed. And very childish... concerned that OP left his age off the title for a reason.. 
543,"&gt;Do I just move into my own home without him and break up?

Yup. This.

You know you can't move forward in this relationship due to your BF refusal to be an honest partner. Any financial entanglements with your BF are absolutely unsafe for you. 

So, you need to move into your own home. If you do allow him to rent from you, you'd be best to speak to a lawyer first to make sure you are taking necessary steps to protect yourself... But the wisest thing by far would be breaking up, because this isn't the kind of partnership you want. And that is 100% legitimate. "
544,"This x10. Communicate, communicate, communicate."
545,This guilt does not belong with you. They're out of their minds.
546,"No, it’s not crazy of you - it’s crazy of *him* to not only expect to continue his friendship with her, but for you to be friends with her too. That’s ridiculous. 

That’s great that he recognized he was developing a crush and got advice from a friend. But let’s remember the friend gave the good advice of cutting contact *and* working on your relationship. That’s cute how he somehow only heard half of the advice. 

Claiming to be over the crush is irrelevant. The point is that he did have a crush on her, and now expects to keep that “friendship”. 

He needs to bite the bullet and cut contact. His reaction when you suggest that is very telling. 

No reasonable adult would ever suggest you be friends with this woman. Tell him to decide what’s more important: your marriage or this friendship. He’s known her for what, a matter of months? That should be an easy decision. "
547,"It’s the kind of sad that sticks on you. Over time, I’ve grown a thick skin to all the posts about common relationship problems. This one is deeply disturbing in a way I’ve never encountered before.
OP... I won’t forget you. And I’m sorry."

549,"Pete Davidson!? Is that you?! 


On a more serious note give her time and space to grieve. There are complicated emotions surging through her right now so don't blame her for wanting a time out."
550,"&gt; you can still tell him that you are not ok with him spending that much money on his friend, you don't even need to bring up what he gave you.

You are married, if you guys have combined money then just bring up the price tag for friends gift DO NOT compare with your gift, it kind of makes you look ungrateful and bratty."
551,Therapy. Seriously. But don't shut up. 
552,"This is kind of fucking insane. I have a feeling this is not the first time he has been ridiculous about something and this 

&gt;I've been married to my husband for 25 years, so I've gotten used to his habits overtime

confirms it. "
553,"I'm guessing you actually have a lot more in common with his grandparents and parents than he does, since he seems to think that wealth is just a natural characteristic of his rather than the result of generations of hard work, none of it his own. What a disgusting attitude. Even not counting the fact that he clearly has no respect for you and by extension your hardworking mother, I dont know how you could ever respect him."
554,"I'm a little confused about why you asked your friend the question in the first place, in front of your girlfriend, if you knew it would make her uncomfortable? 

Of course, in a vacuum, it seems your girlfriend is unreasonable. But to purposely bring up something you already know makes her uncomfortable is concerning. "
555,"I would say the chance of him being your broker is over. Don't have a business relationship with someone who quickly jumped to asking you out regardless of what you talked about. You shouldn't have to worry about if he is holding these feelings for you when you're trying to figure out if your retirement account is looking good. And you financial well being shouldn't be tied to someone who might be influenced by their romantic feelings for you.

However if you want to date him then go for it. People meet through business relationship and that can be OK as long as that relationship in no way can affect a persons general well being if it goes south. "
556,Sometimes you have to accept it’s totaled and upgrade to a used but much more reliable model.
557,"A few things. The gf is psychotic, and they're definitely *not* happier than ever following a breach of trust like the one he did. She keeps checking up on you because she's jealous that you got attention from him. He's a cheating lying scum bag, and you and her both were played by him. Sounds like y'all had chemistry together but he has, you know, a girlfriend. Eventually they'll probably break up. But you should move on, no one needs all that crazy."
558,Seconded. This is a serious legal concern.
559,"I didn’t say anything that would make it awkward. We worked out. I told him about an incident that happened when he was six (he stuck his finger in the weight machine while I was working out and it busted his nail.) I told him how much that accident had haunted me throughout the years, how thankful I am that it leaves no permanent scar. Then I kissed him on the forehead and told him I love him. I think we are good. "
560,"&gt;I don't know what to do about this? 

Dump him. "
561,"“Hey, if you ever propose to me it’s not going to be with your ex’s ring, right?”"
562,"&gt; I immediately had second thoughts.

I'm wondering if you haven't been having second thoughts about the relationship for a while and he sensed it, hence the public proposal. I am NOT a fan of public proposals because of the removal of agency and the social pressure."
563,"This comment really touched me. You're right. She's amazing.

Thank you"
564,"&gt;I can’t blame him if I am not willing to get in shouting matches for what I want as I want peace in my home over and above everything. He can be petty and pouting

I'm sorry, what? You can blame him for ALL of that. You shouldn't have to ever get yelled at just for wanting something.

&amp;#x200B;

Your husband is almost certainly abusive. He uses intimidation to get his way."
565,"she's not ""trying to break up"" with you. She broke up with you. She's not your girlfriend. 

She obviously finds the way you view women (and by extension, her) problematic and doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who views women as objects. I get the feeling this was the straw that broke the camel's back for her.

"
566,"If your father is dead set on killing himself, there's not a whole lot you can do about it except babysit and be responsible for him.  That seems like a whole lot of ""no thanks""."

569,"&gt; Was it some exhibitionist fetish? 

Probably and it was disgusting of them to involve you in their fetish without your consent. 

As embarrassing as it might be, you need to sit them down and tell them it was disrespectful and quite disgusting for them to do that to you. Consent doesn't just apply when you are having sex with someone. It applies to fetishes too.  

They are 25 and 23 years old, not horny teenagers. They should know better than this. "
570,"Do your two kids eat or drink in the back of the truck? Do they ever get sick or spit up. Do things ever get spilled? 
As for the sun glasses obviously they are someone else's but does your husband ever have to drive people around etc?

Mean it could be that he cheated. But seriously more telling about your relationship that this is your immediate reaction about your husband. And even more so that you are put off that he is being loving after you accused him of cheating.

Would you prefer that he yelled or ignored you after the accusation?"
571,"You should take this as a sign, he cares more about himself and that is very clear. Don't wait until you marry him to see the sort of person he seems to be. He can't even get you an engagement ring and has high demands for gifts but told you to wait and you won't be getting the same gift treatment. He's a chump"
572,"Lol, his family is nuts.  He is 26 not 16. I would sit him down and outline all the reasons you are uncomfortable with his family including the talk on the boat. They are seriously enmeshed and there should be boundaries in a healthy adult relationship between their son and them. Good luck op."
573,"I'm not black, but I have seen a lot of documentaries about black hair and I know some people that have talked to me about it and the issues they've faced with their natural hair. The conversation about nappy hair is entering the mainstream so more people can understand how it works and how fucked up it is what people have been putting black people through over the way their hair just grows out of their head.

First of all, if your girlfriend wears a wig every day, it tells you she's got some feelings about her hair. Second, if you haven't seen it in three years, that tells you something else about how she feels about her hair.

I don't think you really want to see the actual hairs on her head as much as you want to know what's going on with that wall. So instead of asking to see the hairs on her head and asking her to take down the wall, just ask her why it's there. People build walls to stop people from shitting in their yard, so ask her what shit they were leaving in her yard. Then just try to understand how much it must have hurt. And tell her that you love her even if you don't see her hair and that those people were jerks and that you don't have any of those weird feelings about hair and she doesn't have to be on guard with you over her hair.

But if she needs to hide it from you for her sake, I think you should let it be. At least if she knows that she doesn't have to, maybe in time she'll get comfortable with that idea of not having to hide it from you

Also, I think a ""can I touch your hair"" moment would ***not*** make her happy. ""can I touch your hair"" is a bit of a meme where clueless white people make black people feel like aliens from another planet and if she's been ridiculed over her hair in the past and very strongly wants to wear a wig, she probably does not want to feel that way with you, her white partner. So if she ever does show you her hair, for the love of god, please do not make a big deal out of it."
574,"“Hi, as a reminder I’m out of town on approved leave Friday. Is there anything I can do in advance of my trip to help inventory go smoothly?”"
575,"Also: consider this a “strike” with your friendship. If she really has been a good friend for ten years, this could be a one off (three strikes and she’s out. Having to cancel lunch doesn’t count as a strike, but this shit does.)

I still recommend talking with her after everything is said and done."
576,"Your partner sounds super toxic and controlling. Do you really want your kids growing up learning it's ok to treat you like your partner does? Like, why do you trust this guy to provide for your family?"
577,"So when you discussed it with her, what happened?

How are other chores split?

What is the minimum that you would find acceptable?  For example, you cook she washes dishes.  You plan the meals, make the list, she does the actual shopping."
578,"Is this the first time he's shown you such disrespect? Honestly? 

It's hard to imagine that this dynamic -- in which he tells you one thing, but wants another; whines to get his way; calls you controlling for wanting boundaries; disrespects your time; neglects his daughter -- is a new one."
579,"&gt;Could it also be why he is so tired though? Because loving me is too hard?

No, please. Don't think that. That is poison he uses to justify his abuse. 

You are not to blame for his terrible behavior. The fact that you think that you are means you are in the cycle of abuse, and he has warped reality for both of you. This is very dangerous for you."
580,"When I was in college my roommate left for a weekend and left her alarm on. So on saturday morning, it started going off and she had locked her bedroom door so I couldn't get in to shut it off. I thought I was going to go crazy, and ended up having to leave for the weekend. 

To say this isn't that serious is actually an understatement. Fucking with your sleep is so inconsiderate. You need to talk to her, and at the very least she needs to turn them way down. Snoozing is not a life requirement, its something she enjoys (I think tis weird as fuck why would I want to wake up an hour early to have the rest of my sleep interrupted for that last hour?), and she shares a space with you and doesn't get to have that enjoyment right now, at least now when you are home."
581,"&gt; but I got cold feet as it is in the first floor with a little yard, and it didn't feel secure to me, so I turned down the offer.

&gt; there are broken stairway door windows every now and then, occasional blood on the stairs, loud parties every weekend, so the area is shit.

Your logic isn't exactly sound there. "
582,I have trouble believing that an adult could be this oblivious. You pressured him into doing something he didn't want to do *and* expect him to be happy about it? Ok.

584,"That doesn't sound like a test, that sounds like some dumb ass petty shit "
585,"This isn't about love, this is about the fact that he is verbally and emotionally abusive and manipulative.  Girl, go, this is just the tip of the iceberg."
586,"It sounds like even without this incident you guys would benefit from counseling. I think the fact that you jumped to cheating is more a symptom of the larger issues in your relationship. The fact that you say him being nice and loving ""isn't his normal self"" is a little bit heartbreaking."
587,"Fuck all of them, even the guys. That should do it...

jk, honestly you need to recognize that yeah, the dynamics will shift. But you shouldn't feel bad that you improved yourself. Just tell them plainly how you feel. If they're really your friends (and for a long time) they'll understand"
588,"The woman who takes her top off and hops in the hot tub with her brother in law is the paragon of virtue here? I'd studiously, studiously, ignore her.

edit: and btw, I bet a buncha lira that the only reason she said anything to anyone is because you told her you were uncomfortable and she started thinking about how all this would look, so she worked really quick to dump you overboard any way she could think of. Hence the bizarre grab bag. "
589,"I could see this go either way.  
   
It comes down to the fact that if one person doesn't want a house... you don't buy the house.   Even if you totally disagree with them.  
    
But your wife will now pick apart any houses you look at &amp; blame you when they come up short in comparison.  
   
So if you want to hold your ground here, be ready for it to affect the entire home buying process.   "
590,Had you not talked about getting engaged or married at all prior to? 
591,"I guarantee he was holding out hope that OP would recriprocate, cancel her wedding, and run away with him into the sunset. Especially since  *she* was the one who asked *him* out all those years before. 

This is definitely speculation, but I wonder if he's one of those people whose ego can't handle someone having feelings for him and then getting over it and moving on into a happy, healthy relationship with no regrets."
592,"He feels obligated to attend a party thrown by a bunch of people who blew you off on your birthday and then deliberately excluded you from the invitation they gave him?

Yeah, nah. He needs to cowboy up and tell them to fuck off, though maybe not in so many words."
593,"First of all, I wanted to say I'm sorry about your dad.

Honestly, I think he might actually have some serious feelings for you. From my experience as a guy, a purely platonic with a friend of the opposite sex without ever thinking 'what if' once is pretty hard, and from not being able to have a serious girlfriend to the whole in-love situation, I think *he's* getting cold feet for the wedding"
594,"&gt;at the party my wife introduced herself as my wife to an acquaintance of mine and the acquaintance replied 'oh, I thought he was with Agnes.' Not a good look.

Honestly, your coworker was probably trying to highlight how shady you look. Your ""friendship"" with Agnes is probably a point of gossip in the office and you don't even know it."
595,Imagine if your husband's brother was showing you his dick every once in awhile and your husband thought that was okay and still hung out with him and made you see him. 
596,"I don't think it really matters how she feels towards you because the answer is the same regardless, that you need to step back until you get over your own feelings. "
597,"Not all physical affection is sexual. Clearly in this context it was a gesture of affection -- and not an uncommon one at that. 

I don't understand how his mind went into the gutter on this one, I wouldn't think this is weird at all. He totally made it about himself and I would tell him to get the fuck over himself and quit pouting like a child. "

599,"There is nothing at all wrong with wanting a partner with a financially stable/supportive job.  That is just part of being an adult.

If he had lost his job and was trying to find another, and you weren't being supportive, I would possibly judge that.

But you sound primarily annoyed at the prospect of him wanting to jump to a field that is not stable or very contributing.

That is a choice that is up to BOTH of you in a LTR.  

If his plans derail your life choices you have every right to be annoyed.

But on the same note, if he feels this is just something he has to do, then that makes ot pretty rough.

But I am slightly in a similar situation.  I love to write, and am working on a novel.  I want to publish and continue with my writing.

Now, the average published writer makes $800 a year(some random fact from my 10 yo creative writing book).  But I also wanted a family, so it wasn't really that hard of a compromise.  

I'm a profession chemist to make money, and I write in my spare time with much support from my wife, and even kids now.

I would put my writing passion equal to his guitar.  I even make some money, it probably equates to something like pennies an hour, but it is what I love to do.

I am only saying that you can pursue a passion while still working, and in today's day and age, I can't even comprehend someone trying to make a living with a hobby like that and raising a family with any sort of stability."
600,did he say it meanly or as a concern that you have no support system other than him and your mom?
601,"Yeah it made me sad that she was trying to defend herself by saying it wasn't a  vacation and it was her dearest friends. Like there's nothing wrong with going on a 6 day vacation with friends! 

Both my partner and I have gone away without each other, like normal adults, and it's fine. Yeah you might get jealous that you have work when someone else is getting a holiday but what sort of petty idiot doesn't just accept it and move on?! What kind of person takes revenge?"
602,"We live in a small apartment and don't care much for privacy from each other. So of he is in the shower, I'll come into the bathroom to brush my teeth. I will always yell ""I'm here!"" so he isn't startled when someone is suddenly looking at him in the shower. Has nothing to do with privacy but with avoiding uncomfortable situations."
603,"As someone who always has to put husband's family first on holidays, speak up or you'll resent it later. Especially once kids are in the picture. 

Do a half day alone, half day with his family. If he won't even accept that...you might want to rethink getting married. "
604,"Break up with him. This relationship sounds incredibly abusive, and you need to get away from him. Whether or not you return to your home country or not I can't comment on, but the important thing is that wherever you go- he isn't there. You don't owe him anything. "
605,"Yeah, I don't understand why he can't just put up one of those folding screens behind him as a backdrop.  I too would find this intolerable. "
606,"Yes you should.  Don't leave her to grieve with the added guilt of having kept it a secret.

How to tell her?   Thank her for the good years you've had together.  Mention that when you found out about her affair with [name] you actually thought the two of your were done.   Let her know that you consider the turnaround in your marriage as your proudest achievement.

Do not get into the details of how much you know about the affair unless she asks.   Just let her know that you knew at the time.  Since your marriage was so dysfunctional at the time, it was just one more bad thing to deal with and that you have never regretted staying with her."
607,"I really don't care what they're into sexually. It's none of my business, but they made it my business by making me an unwilling participant. Yeah, they should know I'm not down with that at all. I'm not a prude, or anything, but I have my own sexual hangups that they are very aware of, which makes it worse."
608,"I was widowed at 37 (11.5 years married) and I tell people this too when they ask ""when do you get over it?"" You do not get over it. You learn to live with it. That's not what people want to hear but it is true. "
609,"I'd start with telling him you used to date his son. That is likely going to be a conversation in of itself. Once you've broached discussing that much, see if it changes how you feel about his attendance and bring up his attendance if it continues to bother you. "
610,"Yeah, she seems very dismissive of his concerns. ""He says he doesn't like his job, but *I* think he should like it, so...he's wrong."" He's telling you what he needs OP, but you're not taking him at his word. Instead, you're filtering through your own experience and deciding if he's ""allowed"" to feel the way he feels, and dismissing it if you decide he's not.

Part of being in a relationship is dealing with the curves life throws at people as a partner, which sometimes involves editing life plans because of an issue in your partner's life. I'm not sure why you can't have a child while you're working as an engineer and he's in school. Or why he can't agree to not go full time, but switch to a part time job and part time class.

The point I'm making here is that you have so many compromise options, but no compromise will work until you start from a place of just...believing him. If you start from your place of deciding which wants he's justified in having, it will show and compromise will be painful instead of collaborative."
611,I think you might be in denial...You deserve SO much better than this guy. 
612,It's actually this simple. Godspeed. 
613,"&gt; he drove an hour away from home to hang out with this guy who she doesn't even really know in a town she isn't familiar with and left alone for 3 hours. 

I mean your roommate sounds like an asshole. Even if you were not bothered by him ditching a stranger in your shared space. I would be pretty pissed this guy invited a girl over, had her drive for an hour to get there and then ditched her for 3 hours. "

615,"“Hey bf, I love you so much and i think it’s great that you want to help me out. However, my idea of going to the gym and yours are very different. I really need to manage my gym routine myself so that I keep enjoying it and move at my own pace. Thanks for the interest, but I don’t really need your advice anymore. You chase the fitness goals that make you happy, and I’ll do the same” 


If he’s not accepting of your personal autonomy, then you have a way bigger problem "
616,[removed]
617,Oh she doesn’t anymore. I had to pay to have the locks changed to be sure but she doesn’t have a key now. Which of course hasn’t stopped her from parking in the lot and waiting for me to come home and then calling me to say she’s ‘in the area’ and asking to stop by. She’s not slick. 
618,"The trust issue is a problem.  When I was pregnant, I asked him to keep it between us until the second trimester like many people do.  He told a bunch of people and lied to me about doing so.  There’s also been other things after that, but I feel if those incidents didn’t happen, it’d be easier to take his word on the glasses.  We also have been experiencing a dead bedroom unfortunately."
619,"The kitchen is small and just doesn't have an oven/stove. They have a hot plate and skillet which is why I want to say they can't use our kitchen at all if they continue to leave a mess. As of now, my husband wants me not to stress about this so he's going to just clean after them from now on but I don't think that's right either. "
620,"ah, that does make things tricky.


I guess if you rely on their financial support you either need to follow their rules or become financially independent.

As for the lying to them, this may work in the short term, but it is difficult to keep lies going forever. You may want to try to talk this out with them rather than lying."
621,Don't make rules about whether or not she's allowed to visit him. That's creepy and controlling af. She's grieving someone who mattered a lot to her. Try being sensitive instead of insecure.
622,"He's actively making your workplace uncomfortable and on purpose. He knows it bothers you. Any good manager or owner would prioritize your comfort to a customer's, so letting your direct superior(s) know is a good idea. They should have an idea of how to handle it, whether it means banning immediately or limiting visiting or something. Are you worried about safety too? You may want to make sure you've got escorts for the next few weeks, and even though he's leaving before closing, please make sure you're not being followed home. "
623,"He’s dating a kid because he’s too insecure and emotionally stunted to date a woman his own age.  Nobody in her 30’s is going to put up with whiny, insecure BS. "
624,Right?? Not sure I’d have had the guts at her age. Good job OP!
625,"And in a creepy childish way, like a kid plucking the wings off a fly, just to watch how it squirms. "
626,"I personally am not attracted to those types either! Most of my BF's have been shy, bookish nerdy guys. Your friend is either spending too much time on ""certain"" internet sites that have that point of view or something else is going on. 

Let me guess: Your ""friend"" is not the competitive macho type and is nerdy, or average. Has he expressed an interest in you and you're now ""just friends"". Bam, there you go. He's ""in the friend-zone"" and complaining. "
627,I think one of the bigger issues here is that you opened with stating that he is a compulsive liar. You can really only go so far being intimate with that kind of person who is unwilling to change.
628,"If she does find out after the fact and asks why she wasn't invited, you could say something like ""I didn't want you to feel obligated to attend, when I know you don't enjoy these things."" Then if she asks what you mean by that, you can explain that at most group events, she ends up screaming and crying, so you know she must feel overwhelmed by them, and since she knows that's how she usually ends up feeling at these things, she was probably only attending out of a sense of obligation to the inviter, and so you didn't want to burden her by making her feel she'd let you down by not coming, and you certainly didn't want to have her force herself to attend, and endure something she finds unpleasant."
629,"Oh my goodness, this was hard to read.

Go see your mother. "
630,"It sounds to me like she chickened out of moving in together because of how she feels about the future of the relationship.

This way, she's more 'protected', i.e. it's her apartment and when things go south, *you* leave."
631,"It's *possible* he is dumb enough to feel like, since he didn't actually have sex with someone else, the test is pointless and he's just being stubborn about it.

But if that is true, the fact that he can't muster the emotional intelligence and regard for OP's wellbeing in the aftermath of his betrayal is just as big of a red flag as having sex with a prostitute. 

Things are looking Very Bad in your marriage, OP. Might want to at least start considering what a separation might look like."
632,"Dude, this is abuse. Like, seriously, google it. She ignores what you want, makes you feel like shit for not reaching some unattaible high standard (hint: no date you ever plan will ever be good for her because *she doesn't want it to be* and then makes it *your fault*) and wants you to drop hobbies, family, friend and dog to be at her beck and call.

She doesn't even value you as a person and is actively ruining your work life *on purpouse.*

You are not selfish. You are being perfectibly reasonable and she just refuses to listen to you.

Because *she doesn't care*.

I would re-evaluate your entire relationship. She *hates your hobbys*, man, why is she with you?

(And if she claims that she's insecure or something, then she's clearly not ready to be in a relationship.)

&amp;#x200B;"
633,"&gt; he just expected me to take on the more traditional woman's role with kids.

Funny how those ""traditional values"" favor him entirely. Is he volunteering to take on the ""traditional"" male role, providing all the income?

Even if you wanted to provide all the childcare, this is a  terrible situation this is for you. He tells you over and over and she's HIS child, not yours, and that you have no authority as a parent. But you're expected to take on the parenting role because he's fucking lazy. So how does this play out as she gets older? Are you allowed to set rules and boundaries, give out consequences for misbehavior, etc? Or is all of that off the table because she's HIS child and you're just the girlfriend?"
634,"Congratulations on your physical and mental makeover. It’s great that you’re more confident and look better. That’s hard to do. Now, it’s time to lose the training wheels. Please, for your own sake, drop whatever confidence-building playbook you’re using that leads you to believe things like “literally every girl there loves me” and use childish concepts like “the friend zone” and “the role of the pursuer.”

It sounds like you’re using some kind of guidebook where you modify your behavior in order to impress women. Stop modifying your behavior in order to impress women. Do what makes sense to you, and you’ll end up with the right women (and people in general) in your life. If you’re viewing the world using artificial and oversimplistic frameworks like “the friend zone” and you’re basing your behavior on what you think women want, as opposed to the way you want to be, you might be coming off as more of a virgin than you think you are. "
635,Thing is they are paying for my education. And that is something they are using as leverage.
636,Get your brother to speak with your mother. She needs to be aware of what's going on so she can protect him. 
637,"My question is why are you paying attention. Do what you want! Get a well paying job, buy what you want with your money! He can have opinions but he can’t tell you what to do. Tell him you’re having a night out with friends and leave him with the kid. Text him and tell him to make sure he’s paying attention!  If the only thing bugging you is his opinion. Then just ignore them! Even better, complain about how hes not making enough and that his hobbies are stupid and he should be spending money on you/the kid. If he can complain and have rules, you can too! "
638,"Yep. At the very least, there's something suspicious going on, and his update should make OP *more* worried, not less.

- He first stops responding because of ""patent confidentiality reasons""
- Then he completely bails on their planned meetup, with no heads up (via *any* forms of communication)
- Now he claims his phone was ""destroyed""?? What are the chances of this happening within a day of his *previous* non-response period?

The worst part is, OP appears to believe all these excuses.

I can only hope this boyfriend screws up with this web of lies soon, so that OP has her eyes opened ASAP.

ETA: Also of note is the fact that the one text he finally responded to, was when OP said she was coming over to check on him. Wow, it's almost as if he has something to hide!"
639,"He's matched with you two separate times but, just like you, is hesitant to make a blatant move. You're both scared to make the first move. Just do it so you can get on with it."
640,"Because he’s got her convinced that she’s an asshole if she cares about frivolous things like financial security or emotional maturity. 

Happens all the time. Young women are particularly susceptible to it. "
641,"Well that isn’t good either, is it? You gave this guy a cheap place to stay so they could save money for a house but he isn’t even working, so right there, he is taking advantage. Now he disrespects you, disrespects your home, disrespects your stuff and you can’t discuss it with him because he is also an unreasonable drunk? "
642,"Smart, capable women stay with abusive partners because we tell ourselves we’re smart and capable enough to solve the problem versus admitting “defeat” and walking away. We tell ourselves that we can find the original man we knew, the funny, available, romantic partner we bragged up to our friends. When we envision admitting to ourselves that we’re in an abusive relationship and ending that relationship, we also envision the shame we'll feel for being duped into such a situation, and we cringe at the pity that others will feel for us. We worry that we can no longer be the friend others rely on because, obviously, our credibility will be shot.

Sound familiar?

Here’s the thing though - none of that is true. You’re a smart, dependable, thoughtful person. You’re not a fortune teller who could see what was coming, and you’re not this man’s therapist who can guide him from his own rage. Take care of yourself, and give yourself the advice you’d give a friend."
643,do you really want to be with a man in his 40s who is so crippling insecure that he cries over what his coworkers could MAYBE be thinking?
644,"Yes. Make it clear that she shouldn't apologize, because you've already forgiven her. 

You're a gem of a human, OP. You're making the best of what you have left. "
645,"Seriously, rent a PO Box and give her that if she want ""to send you stuff""."
646,"Wow yeah that is a huge violation of patient privacy by what looks like just pure incompetence. I'd call and tell them what's happened and maybe your country's health board that handles that sort of thing. 
You have every right to be angry and I doubt you're the only one."
647,"...I really don’t understand how anyone could feel sympathetic for you here. Making fun of someone’s mistakes when you know they’re a perfectionist with anxiety is one of the biggest douchey moves ever. 

While I hope things work out between you and your girlfriend, stop making this about your intentions, and own up to hurting her feelings. Stop using the flimsy shield of “But I was just kidding!” and say “That was rude of me to say and I now realize that it really hurt your feelings. I’m very sorry and won’t do it again- how can I make it up to you?” And back this up with your actions. DON’T do it again. DON’T tease your girlfriend when she’s stressed. 

You guys need to sit down and have a discussion about boundaries. If she wants space, give her space. Trying to force a conversation will push her away more. 

EDIT: I see I gendered incorrectly and OP is a woman according to the title. My point still stands. "
648,"This is not okay. My partner and I are in similar age groups (20 and 24) but my partner would never do this to me. I'm disabled too, also quickly losing mobility and body strength/functionality. He helps me get up, wash, dress, walk, etc. He'll carry me in his arms if he has to. He makes sure I eat and that I take my meds. He assists me in medical appointments. Through all of this, he is still an amazing partner and lover. He would *never* even think about hitting or hurting me! So please...for you too, try to find someone who can help you get out. This isn't the kind of relationship you want. "
649,[deleted]
650,"Your mom is coming off as an entitled brat and honestly, her behavior here would make me not get her any present at all."
651,I wouldn't want his member inside of me after it's been inside of my sister's kid. Disgusting. I would get a divorce and only speak to him through my attorney. 
652,"Absolutely this. You can't change her relationship's dynamic, but sure as hell you can protect your right to a quiet night of sleep. Focus on that. Maybe the neighbors can report her shouting to the cops, but I'm not 100% comfortable suggesting that you ask them to do that."
653,I think you should go back to Target and buy a T-shirt with a Rainbow flag on it for yourself. 
654,"Here’s the good news - he’s not the love of your life.  The love of your life wouldn’t intentionally betray you like that.  He’s just some loser you spent six months with, nothing more.

He did it because he wanted to.  He went over with the intention to fuck her.  He planned it.  He’s not some victim.  That was his goal.  

He’s not insecure, he’s just a selfish idiot who thinks with his little head.

You can, and will, find much better than him.  This pain will ease with time."
655,"Yeah.... There's something wrong with this guy. I got married at 18 and it was the best decision of my life. I'm getting a ""trying to manipulate her into giving him permission to approach her sister"" vibe. Fucking sick whether he's 15 or 50.

OP, I say this with love, you get your self to a therapist asap. Seriously, please gather up whatever love you have for yourself and do this one thing before you make any other decisions! I went through therapy at 40ish and my only regret is that it took me so long. It was so hard to make the call, and really scary to go, but it was so amazingly wonderful for me. 

The way your husband is treating you is not normal and it's not okay. It's weird and trashy and gross. It's okay to say ""I'm starting to feel like our sex life is slipping. One thing I'd like for us to do is work together to get into better shape. Do you have any concerns or suggestions?"" It is not okay to giggle and ""confess"" that your attraction to your spouse is fizzling but you want to what?... date?... bang?... openly fantasize about?... your spouse's sibling! I don't care if you gained 400lb and stopped bathing or washing your clothes, he has *no right* to speak to you like that! "
656,"“I love you and this changes nothing for us. It was an accident and we both know it. I’ll be on the couch with popcorn and Netflix when you’re ready to snuggle and relax, but if you just need some space I’ll give it to you.” "
657,"I don't understand the comments you're getting here. PPD is serious. Good for you for getting through that, and it's understandable you felt isolated and alone through it! That built-up resentment will just continue to fester if you try to brush it under the rug and ignore it. It sounds like you saw first-hand that your husband is not as emotionally supportive as you needed during a rough time in your life. That can definitely make you feel like you're falling out of love. Whether or not he was just clueless and overworked himself or not, your feelings and your experience is valid.
 Being isolated from your support system and brushed off by him didn't help.

Giving your husband the benefit of the doubt, I would try to see if he will go for a counselling or two sit with you, even if just to have the opportunity to feel heard and validated for what you went through. If you are feeling distant from him, being able to address your experience in a safe place can help bring you closer together and may change your view again on him. Stress that although the worst is over, you still feel like you need to address what went on. He should be willing to at least do that for you, and having that support would go a long way to help your mindset now, as well as teach you both how to communicate your needs to each other better. That he said he didn't realize how bad it was for you shows that there has been a breakdown in communication, either talking or listening. A marriage counsellor can help with that. I also suggest finding a mother's group or something you can socialize a little more with other young mothers so you have some more release for your tensions. Being a stay at home mom is hard work and other mother's understand that too. Isolation makes everything harder.

 And keep up with your individual counselling to be sure you stay on a healthy path. Sometimes we go into autopilot ""get it done"" mode and it's not until things get a little better until we finally realize how bad they were. Sometimes it is then that our psyche feels safe enough to address what it went through. Healing is not always linear! Good luck."
658,"Honestly, he wants your permission to do something he knows is hurting you. Don't give it to him.

This is emotionally draining and you need to let it light a fire under you, not inside of you.   If you lose weight, do it for YOU and YOUR health. 

Because I assure you, you could lose weight, fart sprinkles, vomit money and piss rainbows and he will still see you as a place holder until someone better glances his way. 

The deficit is in HIS character and has nothing to do with you. Honey, you make the commitment to yourself that he isn't making to you and THEN reevaluate your relationship. 

FFS. Your husband doesn't deserve you. Seriously. "
659,FFS I didn’t even process that it’s just regular old TV football. I thought BF was on a team so at least she’d watch _him_ play.
660,Don't have children with a man who would do *any* of this. Get the hell out and take some time to consider what's up with your self-esteem and judgement that you'd consider having a baby with a guy like this. 
661,"He knowingly used a bottle of your lotion - most likely not as lube, I bet he dumped it down the drain - because he knew you liked it and cared about it.

He is angry with you and is not openly communicating that.

He was rude to you when you asked him about it and told him how it made you feel.

This is fucking bizarre behavior and yes you should absolutely tell him that he NEEDS to replace it. This is not something a healthy couple does. I repeat, THIS IS NOT HEALTHY. Whatever his deal is, stop beating around the bush with him and make sure he talks to you and apologizes."
662,"You really need to take all of that evidence to the police for a restraining order.

&gt; turning up at my parents house and crying outside in his car

That's really sad and pathetic, yikes.

ETA: you really should get some security cameras as extra evidence for that restraining order, even just some little cheap ones you point out of your window. If your windows are all on the ground floor then get something that allows you to store the footage real-time online or somewhere secure in case he is stupid enough to break in.

If you haven’t already, take ALL communication he’s attempted to the police. All letters/texts/emails. Write down if he approaches you or one of you friends/family, keep a log. Get your parents/neighbours to make a statement to police about how often he’s just sitting there outside the house. This is already full-on “unhinged stalker”, you don’t want it turning into “rapist and/or murderer”."
663,"I've gotten that insane impromptu ""Let's run away and get married, today!"" offer.

It's laughable in kind of a horrific way when it comes from someone who's been so awful to you and the cause such ongoing pain and heartache. I'd be lying if I said I didn't entertain it for a split second, so I know that feeling (pure manipulation, not love, I had to remind myself)."
664,This is true. I have lost a lot of respect for them.
665,"As an objective rule, any guy that capriciously obstructs your profession or income has got to go, regardless."
666,"And he doesn't understand that people need money to survive. That will surely cause problems down the road if they end up getting married. The first time there's a storm, even as minor as losing a job, he won't be able to manage and hopefully his parents will be around to help him out. "
667," Children aren't compromises, they're commitments"
668,This is bizarre. Is your BF bi? To be honest I don’t understand anything about that kind of “relationship” and what kind of gratification Mr. Bitcoin would get out of it but it sure deserves some answers from your BF. If not I would not count on that relationship continuing and be sure to protect yourself and your finances
669,"Divorce him. I don't want to be mean, but your husband is just as trashy as his 'mom'. You are not going to want to be stuck in this situation years down the road. "
670,"From your update. Did he have any other means of communication? Typically people send something like and email, fb message ext to the people they talk to most if text it going to be down. Although if he barely uses his phone anyways then I could see him not doing it if it's only been 1 day."
671,I'm pretty sure your sister is a sugar baby. 
672,"Do you ever stand up for yourself ? You sound very supportive and sweet and that’s great but if you don’t set your boundary now she’ll run over it and never come back . Call her out when she mistreats you and if she continues seriously ask yourself can you imaging the rest of your life feeling that way or god forbid your kids having that feeling . 
I. Grew up in an extremely verbal and emotionally abusive household and sometimes I would say thing to my now husband that was totally out of line without even thinking and it didn’t get better until he called me out on my shit and basically told me if I couldn’t treat him right he can always find someone who can. Kind of harsh but god damn I’m so thankful he did . I was like your fiancé I grew my confidence but I had to realize I had behaviors just like my mom and I identified them and corrected them . It was hard but worth it , it improved my life . "
673,"He didn’t say it didn’t affect him. He said it wasn’t traumatic.

If you worked in a spice factory for 6 months handling cinnamon, you might not want cinnamon on your French toast. Doesn’t mean it’s traumatic. Its entirely possible to have a strong negative association with something that Isn’t trauma.

I don’t find it vague at all. He mentioned midnight emergency calls, the death itself, etc. It sounds like: a stressful job site. Think of a stressful job you didn’t like. Now picture that your new house looks exactly like that. Do you want to live there? Would you call it “trauma”, or just “that job as stressful and I don’t want constant reminders of a stressful period?”"
674,"OP, it's about her welfare. Get her some counseling, it's not easy to lose a parental figure. But i do worry a bit because your husband doesn't seem to recognize boundaries within your family much, or do you have a not so close bond with your sibling? While cheating is not illegal, it can really skew how one views bonds, especially when it involves her aunt. Adults like to think that kids know nothing, because that's easier than to acknowledge that their behaviour makes the kids feel uneasy about the stability in their basis. She's a teen, she probably knows some of what's been going on. You're playing the long game here, sometimes one can only recognize as an adult what's been damaging and what not. 

Good on you for getting that job, btw. Keep taking steps. Your husband probably will have to contribute some. Get very informed on how you can get there and take your time to prepare. 

"
675,"&gt; I don't know how to communicate with him. We have obviously been having other problems as well, he is bipolar and it has been a struggle in many ways.

Communication is your problem. The sex issues are secondary... or maybe further down the line from the lack of ability to communicate.

He is BiPolar... Is he seeing someone for his problem? Is he on medication, that might take a serious toll on his sex drive?

Are the two of you healthy otherwise?

I'm sure others will point this out, but it's very obvious here that if you want to save this relationship you're going to need to learn to communicate, and that's likely going to need to start with professional counseling."
676,"Your husband is acting like an asshole. Full stop. Him telling you ever that you need to lose weight for your marriage to work is complete bullshit meant to shift the blame for what is not working onto you. 

There are several things that make me want to kick you husband's ass:
1) Rather than say ""hey I notice that you seem to feel insecure about your weight. I love you no matter what and I want to support you however you need me too,"" he did THE EXACT OPPOSITE. No no no. Your body is not the thing ""wrong"" with the marriage, his mindset is. He cannot shame you into changing your body with your whole damn marriage as the carrot. No!

2) I cannot believe he told you that he has a crush on your sister. CANNOT BELIEVE. This is something you work through on your own, maybe confide in with your best buddy to get advice on how to get over it so that you can direct that energy into your marriage. He told you purely selfishly, to make himself feel better. There would never be any benefit to you ever ever knowing that.

3) He is not trying to comfort you at all. He is telling you some terrible things he shouldn't, and still making it all about him.

He is a callous man and completely unprepared to be a supportive partner. You deserve so so so much better than him. Your weight is not the problem: the problem is he has made the whole marriage about him rather than a partnership. If you lost weight, he would find something else. 

(Side note, but please do undertake any weight loss with a medical professional's super vision. The intense calorie counting and starvation you are describing wanting to put yourself through is an eating disorder - and yes, overweight people can have eating disorders, are less likely to be treated for an eating disorder, and can still die from an eating disorder. )

Counseling is probably in order to deal with what seems like may be the end of your marriage, and it would be good to find someone to talk with about how your relationship to your body has played into all of it, because it sounds traumatic.

You deserve so much better!!"
677,[removed]
678,"If he's not going to tell you what info to specifically keep to yourself, he can't get mad at you for having a casual conversation, that's bullshit.

That's a weird thing to get hung up on too, I mean my friends buy and sell bikes all the time, I wouldn't think one of them was poor for selling one, likely just a passing thought of one of them not liking the bike or wanting a different one."
679,Laughing with me? I'm laughing at myself now
680,"Umm I don't see why you shouldn't confide in your sister. She will give you so much support here. And also like... I feel like you have kind of a duty to her, your family member, to tell her that your husband has been obsessing over her for the past 3-4 years. "
681,fuck that noise dude. you'd never be able to fully trust her again if you got back with her and it would be miserable. no. a thousand times no
682,He doesn't sound like much of a boyfriend. I'd cut him loose. Who takes a vacation with no end date? Sounds like his vacation was more important to him than you. Not something I'd want to deal with. 
683,Never play the others have it worse game. Someone else suffering in a different way doesn’t mean your suffering is less than or meaningless or less worthy. 
684,He isn't really your friend. A friend wouldn't hear you were a virgin and IMMEDIATELY start planning a theeesome. And wouldn't start planning it when you didn't even show interest. That's weird as F.
685,"When I've spoken to him about it, he agrees that it's crazy and he just wants his family to be happy for him. For the most part, we always seem to be on the same page. 

He agreed that they will not have a key and that they cannot drop by whenever they want.  I am more than okay with seeing them sometimes, especially on holidays...I just don't think we all need to be attached at the hip. 

Twice, he's said that he just wants me to get along with his family. And that makes me afraid that he thinks I want to make him pick between them and me. And that's the last thing that I want. In small doses, I'm okay with the family. I help them clean, help cook dinner, help with the animals. Talk about their day at work...everything I can think of. 

I do my best to support him and make sure he's okay - but what if he isn't telling me everything? 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole thing stresses me out too. I've been on my own for a very long time and have grown accustomed to handling my own life - so bringing in another person is new to me too. 

Sometimes I wish I could discuss that with him, but there never seems to be any time or room. I don't mean for that to sound selfish"
686,"Don't try to rectify that.  A relationship is a two-person choice, and she's chosen leaving.   Leave her alone.  If she wants to come back, she'll let you know.

Basically, once you've gotten to the point that you decide to leave, suddenly you realize all the things you don't like about the other person that you've been putting up with.  It's an avalanche of information.   She's not going to forget that."
687,"Ask her if Adam will wear a bra and consent to being pegged. In front of her BF.

May lose you friend but I suspect they will back off after that comment 😬"
688,"I love the advice AND the fact that you called her ""angus"" throughout. "
689,"Oh OP. 

Your husband has you isolated and dependent, and not by accident. I think at minimum you need to make sure your birth control is locked down while you figure this out - make sure it’s something long-lasting and something he can’t tamper with. The last thing you need is another pregnancy. 

And whatever you do, do *not* give up your access to whatever support network you have in place, even if you feel like it’s flimsy. That is your tether to sanity, and you may well need to call on your friends for help if your husband escalates his behavior. Do not find yourself with nowhere to turn and no one to contact. Even being able to confide in people, and see friends enjoy healthy, respectful relationships will do wonders for your resilience. It’s easy to gaslight people who have no frame of reference - make sure you keep yours firmly in place. No matter what he tells you, you’re entitled to friendships. "
690,"so, his point is that you'll have two hours to hang out after you get off work, while waiting for him to come pick you up, and you'll be hanging out in your old drug-related places? i think that's a fair objection. how do you plan to spend that time so that it's safe for you? have you been back to those places while sober? do you still have a sponsor or anything like that who you could ask about this situation? 

but i don't think he actually gets a veto here. he gets to express his concerns, and you can explain to him how you're going to address that issue, but usually partners don't get to tell you where you can and can't work. 

"
691,Honestly I’d move to a different city or something. This is weird as fuck. 
692,"I think it sounds like your wife has spent her entire adult life being a mother, defining herself by her motherhood, and doesn't know who she is without children who need her.

Imagine you knew you were going to to have to give up a job you loved and defined youself by - and it was all gradually going to be taken away from you starting in a couple of years.

LOTS of parents struggle when their children leave - not because they don't love their spouse, but because their spouse doesn't _need_ them in the same way, so being a ""wife"" is nowhere near as much of a job/role/identity as being a mother - being a husband only would probably not be enough for you (if you didn't have a job, hobbies, other elements of your identity to bring you happiness).

I would talk to you wife, and maybe work with her to develop an identity outside of motherhood. I don't know if she works/has many hobbies, bit if your kids are old enough, maybe she should consider starting or investing more time and energy in this things."
693,"I knew a guy in college that trained all his flat mates to be pristine in their kitchen etiquette.

He warned them that if they ever went to bed without cleaning the dishes, the next day, when they got home, they would find a pile of dirty dishes on their pillow. I think he only followed through on this threat once.

---

You need to sit down with your husband and discuss what you feel is appropriate. Then the two of you need to discuss what sort of consequences are appropriate.

Then you need to communicate those to your lodgers. If the persist in not behaving, you just need to evict them.

Boundaries are important. Set them. They may be friends, but they don't get to take advantage of you.

---

It might be worth requiring that they get their own set of cooking and plateware."
694,"Tell your husband you are no longer interested in sharing your steps number with him and if he asks you anyway for your number, you will say each and every  time “darling I told you, I am no longer sharing my steps number with you”

Then tell him that he can compete online with other fit bitters. There are several apps that he can anonymously go head to head with people who are interested in having a step off.

From now on, you walk around your neighborhood alone. Women need to remember, your goals and desires are important.

Have courage, tell him no more fit bit between the two of you."

696,"When the people told you that he said 'oh it didn't die', what was THEIR response to the comment? Did they tell you as some sort of light conversation as to what a weirdo he is, or were they immediately concerned?"
697,"Same with my mom. I’ve mentioned this before on this sub but my mom ended up getting sick and passing away at 62, married but VERY alone. Life is too short to waste on human garbage like this dude. He can eat protein bars in his bachelor pad and get his own fucking tires put on. "
698,"&gt;My girlfriend gets piss-drunk every time we go out with friends no matter what the circumstances or intention for the night.

Your girlfriend is an alcoholic, and she needs to realise this herself before you can even dare to have any hope that this is going to get better. 

I would record her behaviour tonight and confront her with the evidence of her drinking problem tomorrow - see if that shocks her into seeking some professional help. I hope for the sake of both of you that it will."
699,"So here's my concern: if you knew it would upset her, we are left with two possibilities:

1. You didn't care it would upset her. Yikes. 

2. You partially wanted to upset her. Reasons for wanting to can range from you wanting to address it since you think it's unreasonable to you just wanting to ruin her day (and possibilities in between). 

So, I guess I'm asking - why did you choose to get laughs at the expense of your girlfriend's mood? Why did getting laughs from your friends take priority over your girlfriend not being upset?"
700,"Also, is it possible that OP's wife was abused by her dad?  This was instantly my first thought, and explains why she had such an extreme reaction to OP commenting on the abuse and also possibly why she feels so protective of the baby.  "
701,"&gt; She says that money shouldn't come in between good relationships

If she truly believed that then she wouldn't be letting money come between your relationship and she would be fine with paying her own way."
702,[deleted]
703,"and be prepared to lose the friendship. I had a friend like this - and after her umpteenth ""relationship"" with someone who barely knew she existed, I gently tried to tell her the truth - and I haven't heard from her since. I miss the friendship sometimes - it was completely one-sided, but she was smart and funny and I always hoped she'd get her act together some day and settle down. Didn't happen."
704,"Your comment has me in tears. Thank you. I legit thought I was going crazy and did something wrong to seriously jeopardize my marriage. 
I am raging. So hard. I looked, and from July til yesterday, Mark was mentioned 12 times. 
He has never shown any interest in my game in 2 years. It is the only thing that gets me adult interaction besides when he comes home from work. And now I feel like I have to let it go to save my marriage and I am so hurt. Its the only enjoyment I get outside of home."
705,"There are a few things that are relevant.

First, as another comment asked, are you doing well enough / they doing poorly enough to need something from you?  Does someone need a liver or kidney?  **Are they reaching out to you, or your resources?**

Second, are they approaching this from a position of contrition?  Did they recognize that you were right and want to make amends?  How did they word it?  I'd recommend writing a letter, but not necessarily sending it.  It will help you gather your thought into something cohesive to help you cover your grievances during the discussion.  if it is a list, that's fine; it is for your thoughts.  You could also send a letter, but that is really your choice.  Remember, tone does not translate to the written word well, though.

Third, what do you want out of it?  Have you built a new family?  Do you have a spouse and kids?  Is your mom someone you want in that family's life as a positive force?

Finally, this isn't a problem with only two answers; there is a complete spectrum between ""no-contact"" and ""back to how it was"".    There are calls every two weeks, there are personal visits if *you* feel comfortable, there are emails, and there are just a polite card on holidays.  It will take time to find out the right level, and I recommend easing into it (it's a lot easier to increase contact from zero to 4 than to go from zero to 10, then dial it back to a 4).

Overall, think about what you want, what you have to lose, and go from there.  You know your situation better than we do."
706,"I agree. 
Probably shouldn’t try to shag a prostitute if you want unprotected sex from your partner.
That aside, you also have to think of the child.

OP, say you have sex and get pregnant AND contact an STD.
Depending on the STD, your child can develop issues such as blindness or threatening blood infections if you have one while the child is in the process of developing. Also depending on the STD, your risk of a miscarriage rises. 

Don’t risk your life and the life of your potential child for a shady husband who won’t even get tested for the sake of his wife’s health.
To hell with that.

Edit: life to blood infections"
707,"Honestly it sounds like part of the problem is the part where your husband bends to his parents' will so that Jane will get off their backs.  Jane is doing a dandy job of cutting herself off by blocking you, and all your husband has to do is just not respond to her, even when his parents request it.  I would have a firm boundary on her watching the kids or being around if his parents watch--like, even if you're fine with that, she might post pics online which is creepy.  If you do want to share pics online you can do it in a closed group that only certain people can see (people who you trust not to share them, in other words.)  "
708,"I'm dying over here OP, oh my god.

Side note: I love how you weren't even upset, you just wanted her to be open with you. This is officially the goofiest and cutest post I've seen on here"
709,"Yes, this exactly. OP, even if you get everything done immediately, your husband is just going to say you're too perfect and deliberately trying to make him look terrible. This is a lose lose situation. "
710,"Oh honey these are not friend and a good night sleep is much more worth it- if you are not really close to the bride, and if it won’t cause huge issues - fake a headache and go home.  Enjoy a comfy bed and write these immature GIRLS off"

712,Some people also tell themselves they are naive/oblivious because they don't want to admit they like the attention.
713,"If he left you, you would have to figure out how to take care of yourself."

716,"Whyyyy is it ok in your marriage for her to spend the night with another guy? Weird. Did you ask if his wife was home that night? 

I don’t think you are being proactive enough here... I fear it’s a bit too late. I would sit her down and ask her what’s going on. If she denies everything, tell her that she has one chance to come clean before you recover the texts. "
717,"This. 

A non enterprise router is not something that gets drilled into the wall or a rack. Simply unplug it and hook it up in one of the back rooms or even run an ethernet cable. My partner and I are both hardcore gamers. We have our router in the living room to power our entertainment center and run 2 flat Ethernet cords along the wall (about 60 feet) to our office in one of the spare bedrooms in our house. 

I understand his need for privacy but not being able to go to the bathroom or grab a drink from the fridge is not a reasonable solution. "
718,"1) She’s not goods

5) A woman arguing with a man is not a failure as a woman, she’s a fucking human being with an opinion
6) If everybody really thought it, no one would have a problem saying it.

And most importantly 
7) when confronted with points 1-6, a person who then doubles down on their view is showing attitudes I wouldn’t want to associate with in any form, much less than being someone I want to share my whole life with."

4. Goodbye

I guess it was his guide to providing closure for us. I could tell he was going through steps when he apologized to me for yelling at me in front of my friends at my 9th birthday party which had been around 14 years prior. I didn’t even remember it, but he was very emotional in explaining to me how he had always felt bad about it. It was a meaningful moment, and I’m glad I have that memory.

I think you should talk about it, face-to-face. "
722,"I was thinking it was going to be littered with HIS red flags (and he does have some, for sure), but the vast majority of what I ended up reading was red flags in your self warning you that this is not a relationship that you're into or that you want.

1st Red Flag: he kissed you immediately, without solicitation, etc.  I've been on dates where I find this okay (especially with high sexual tension and knowing the person beforehand), but you clearly aren't okay with that happening or you weren't comfortable with it.  When he picked up on that, he should have stopped immediately.  More importantly, if there was nothing in your lead up to the date telling him this was okay, he shouldn't have done it period.

2nd Red Flag: You weren't excited or eager to see him.  The time in the relationship where you SHOULD be excited and eager is the beginning.  Did you guys ever have a honeymoon period?

3rd Red Flag: Screw the engagement ring/secrecy for a second.  It's a red flag you were engaged after five months of dating.  That's really quick.  Why did you say yes if it was so soon and this guy doesn't excite you?

4th Red Flag...

Oh, nevermind.  The tl;Dr: of this is that you should not marry him.  Yes, there are super big red flags in this.  You're not excited or eager to be with him and the sexual chemistry is lacking.  Do you really want to spend the rest of your life feeling like this relationship is someone's relationship but not YOUR relationship?  Don't you want sparks and bonfires and sexual chemistry and passion and excited butterflies when you see them (even years down the line?)

Right now, you're settling, big time.  But since there's two of you in this conundrum, you should know that you're also making it so he can't go out and find someone who is excited to be with HIM as well.  You both deserve that.

So end the relationship already and do so.  You can both be lovely, nice people, but that doesn't mean you're lovely for each other for life.  Go find your lovelies.

ETA: by the way, I made the same mistake as you by settling and marrying someone that did not excite me, sexually or otherwise.  I didn't even find him attractive.  It lasted ten years and I regret, deeply, wasting those years on him.  We divorced and now I'm with someone that IS my passion and my fire.  It's never too late.  Be as good to yourself as you would to your best friend.  You deserve that."
723,"My boyfriend is an introvert and I’m an ambivert. I’m almost always cool with being in the same room as him doing my own thing and him doing his. But sometimes he needs to go and be in his room by himself. We also have separate bedrooms. It’s great because we have different work schedules so we never have to worry about messing up the other’s sleep schedule, but then we can share the same bed when it will work. Today’s our 3rd anniversary and I’ve never loved anyone more than this man. He’s just wonderful. Who cares if we’re normal"
724,"I don't like that because it isn't your genuine feelings but a carefully worded message to appear friendly and professional. I feel like if you have been friends with someone for 10 years you shouldn't have to be fake with them. And this doesn't make clear to her how upset you are. If she then doesn't clean up much and you're furious and hugely disappointed, you really won't have made that clear to her.

Instead, I think you need to just tell her the truth without trying to ""handle"" her. Tell her that your parent's home is in an awful state and you are incredibly stressed about them coming home tomorrow. You set this up, told your parents she could be trusted, and you feel like this is going to damage how your parents see both of you. On a personal level you feel really hurt and disappointed that she would put you in this position. You are going to come over right after work to help her clean up because your parents don't deserve this and it needs to be fixed. However, you'd feel a lot better if you saw she'd been trying to fix this herself and made significant progress by the time you got there. Also, she should not expect you guys will be getting any sleep until the place is spotless and don't make any evening plans. This *needs* to get done. 

Then come over and do it with her. (Only way to make sure it is done to a decent standard or at all.) If she complains she wasn't paid explain to her that she got free rent and utilities for 6 weeks, which is in fact a very favorable deal. What made it a good deal for her parents was that the whole family thought she was someone they could trust with the place and know it would be the same when they got back. "
725,A guy who sees girls as numbers? Kill it before it lays eggs.
726,"&gt;For him nagging means: 

&gt;talking about future, 

&gt;making him clean after himself, 

&gt;asking him to come to eat when he is playing on his computer, 

&gt;having a problem and wanting to talk with him, 

&gt;me feeling sad and wanting comfort.

You want him to behave like a normal responsible adult, but he does not.  And when you ask him to do normal responsible adult things, he accuses you of *nagging* him.

In the past, his solution to conflict was to run off and not tell anyone where he was going, or why he was going.  That's not a good sign of maturity, and it looks like he is considering doing the same thing again.

&gt;Am I unreasonable? What should I do?

Yes, you're being unreasonable to expect he will suddenly turn into the man you want him to be.  That's not going to happen just because you want it to happen.

I think you should realize your boyfriend *doesn't want to be with you, but is too cowardly to break up with you.*

He wants *you* to end it.  He's really bad at taking responsibility for things. so rather than honestly tell you straight out that he wants out of the relationship, he's overtly criticizing and complaining about you in the hope *you* will tell him it is over.  That way, he can keep on believing that he is a good honest person, and you are the unreasonable nagging person.

He's been so explicit in telling you he is unhappy in the relationship.  He wishes you would never speak to him.  He thinks you nag him constantly.  He has no interest in discussing short-term plans and expectations.

Perhaps you don't want to see what is very obvious, but it would be best for you to acknowledge this man doesn't want a future with you.  

He doesn't want a *present* with you either.  He wants to be free of your expectations.

I'm sorry.  I don't think there's a good reason for you to continue trying to make this work.  He's not interested in making it work.

"
727,"Definitely not weird. I do that as well. Is the pretty introverted? Often times an introvert will expend their enegery while working all day and just not have the motivation to continue socializing when they get home. Super normal, super healthy for relationships honestly. "
728,Yup. That is the truth the vendors actually ask you if you want a congrats on the package just to throw off your husband. I was shocked when I was asked this.
729,"It sounds like she's always the one that has to initiate things or institute change. That is exhausting, and ultimately it's hard for her to see her SO as a partner or an equal if you are incapable of making life changes without her prodding you. It's hard to continue being attracted to a partner when you have to act like their parent, and I can definitely understand why she's feeling this way. You seem just like someone that coasts through life. Things are good enough, and you don't have motivation to change that. You might be better suited with someone with a similar outlook, but it feels like your current SO is waiting for you to grow up and you're just - not."

Also work to build positive things between you two. Go to a movie, meal, or activity together. Work on a project together."

738,"The dude lost his shot.

I literally came back home an hour ago from a super similar situation. This guy has this whole ""Are you ok? How are are you feeling?"" thing going every 15 minutes that makes me feel like he's super thoughtful and considerate, but he literally told me that I should have told him I wasn't having fun/was feeling uncomfortable because how was he supposed to know? I mean I came to you place to hang out, not to sleep in late and to sit next to you while you browse reddit.

Idk man, I'm really empathetic so I told him not to worry and we'll still hang out, but I highly doubt I can feel attracted to him again after this. Men who barely put effort and refuse to make a move are a big turn off for me too. Especially because I'm definitely out of his league, too.

My advice is to stay away. You deserve better."

I suggest you avoid talking to her about how she ""has a problem"" maybe discuss a specific drink limit before the outing. Once she goes over this limit and gets ""embarrassing"" record it and show it to her.

Also, at least some of this is you being selfish and controlling (even if it's for good) embrace that, and don't get defensive to that fact.

749,"Jeez, I can see why your close girl friend doesn’t like your girlfriend. She’s insanely controlling and aggressively insecure. Honestly, I feel like she’s acting like a insecure obsessive 18 year old. She needs to grow up, maybe get therapy to manage her insecurities. You should not be bending to the ridiculous demand that you have no females in your life but her, and I say this as a 25 year old woman. She needs individual therapy as well as couples counseling. 

At the end of the day, you may find you guys just don’t have compatible views on certain things, and need to part. Not a bad thing, but you can’t just be a doormat to her demands."
750,"Even if you aren't getting paid, there is a very basic assumption that you will clean up after yourself. That is what adults do. You would be totally justified in asking her to clean up her shit."
751,"Well, she made that easy. The moment that you ask her to step up and contribute as an adult, he runs back to mommy and daddy. She isn't ready to be an adult and you can not act as a substitute parent or caretaker. 

My advice is to ~~change your locks~~, pack her shit, and drop it off at her parents. Life is too short to wait around hoping someone will change. 

Edit: Only change your locks if you are the only one on the lease and **after** discussing this with a lawyer and your apartment manager. "
752,"&gt; I have brought up counseling before, but he doesn’t seem to think we need it since ‘everything is fine now’. It’s really not.

"
753,"&gt;I picked up the slack when he could not cover more than rent and it would be really nice if he could do this for me. Am I being selfish here?

I don't think you're being selfish. You were thinking like a team where the previous situation was temporary, you shouldered the burden, and now it could potentially swing in the other direction to help you out. Your SO is only thinking of himself."

758,"Hey OP I just wanted to pop in and offer a slightly different perspective

&gt;shouldn’t he be sharing with me how he’s doing and how he’s feeling?

When I'm upset, I hate talking about it. Maybe later, when I've calmed down, but while I'm actively grieving or feeling disappointed, I don't even really have anything to say. I can't articulate my feelings, I can't express what's bothering me. 

Part of the issue here is that you're expecting your partner to grieve the same way that you would grieve, which isn't a fair ask. You can't ask someone to grieve differently to accommodate you. Everyone handles things differently.

That being said, I do think it's a reasonable compromise to ask for a simple check-in text or small conversation each day. I think that's fair, and you can ask for that. And it does sound like your partner is generally unwilling to accommodate your needs and overall takes you for granted. 

Without the relevant background info, I would say to ask for a simple check-in message and work together moving forward. But with the relevant info, I think you should ask yourself if this relationship is worth the heartache and the trouble it causes you, and if this is the way you can imagine yourself living for the rest of your life."

Your current dream is just one symptom of a larger problem (aside from the controlling husband problem) - you're not the same person you were when you got married. And it's probably not even fair to say you've ""changed,"" because it's more like you've ""grown up."" You didn't even really know who you were when you got married, but now you're growing into your own skin, and realizing you can't live a live sentence of being under your husband's thumb. You've grown into a person who is incompatible with him. You have different values. You can try convincing him to ""let"" you get more education, or have a career, or even to just have a job. But even if he agrees, he's still not viewing you as his equal, as his partner. "
760,"In what world is it ok to tease someone about something you *know* has been stressful and upsetting for them, especially in front of an audience where they’ll probably be extra humiliated by the teasing?

You ought to know better at your age how much of a dick move that is. 

Own it, apologize, and give her some space. When she wants to talk to you, make it up to her in a way she would like. Flowers, a nice date, whatever. "
761,"&gt;The thing is... I can't get over the fact that a girl would defend the abuser over her friend.

Read up on abuse dynamics and her reaction will make a lot more sense. If her fiance is like most abusers, he's probably been working overtime to wear down her self-esteem so she feels like she can't leave him. He probably also has her convinced that their relationship is normal and everyone critical of it is the problem.

&gt;My family think I was in the wrong and she was right.

Your family is mistaken but I wouldn't even bother having that argument with them. What I would do instead is leave the lines of communication open for Ana in the event that she comes to her senses and needs some support. She's been a less than stellar friend to you, but she's also dealing with some extenuating circumstances. If and when she manages to free herself from them, she'll probably realize your criticism wasn't just unfounded jealousy."
762,"The patient was expected to die, they were a palliative care patient, meaning they were on hospice. Sounds like OP does that for a living, it's hard work but it's also something they do every day, patient deaths always affect you, and it's not something that should be considered traumatic. "

767,"You guys got married too soon.

This guy is insanely immature and has no idea how to be a spouse. Whether he intends it or not, he’s manipulating and abusing you.

Seriously, run away and focus on healing from this torture. "

769,"A lot of people have made good points in this thread in an effort to help you toward a resolution with your partner but all I can think is: if he honestly finds it that extraordinarily difficult to appreciate the effort you make for him and his daughter, then he doesn’t deserve you in his life at all.

779,"Maybe he doesn't see the value of gifts as a purely monetary thing. I mean if he's well-off, he honestly might not be as focused on the price-tag as the emotional significance behind the item.

&amp;#x200B;

Like sure the vacuum is expensive but he didn't have to put much thought into it. She asked for something specific and he was just like sure. Whereas for you he likely shopped around and put thought into choosing a present. So most importantly, how do you feel about the earrings APART from the cost? Do you feel like he did a good job picking something that was your style, etc.?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really see the point of bringing this up if you felt like the earrings were meaningfully chosen and a thoughtful gift. If you're truly bothered about the price tag, you could bring it up as in ""I feel uncomfortable with you buying gifts above $xxx for friends"" and don't bring up your own present as a comparison, because that's like saying all you cared about was the price and not the thought behind the gift.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I got my SO a vintage watch that was hard to find but not exactly pricey. I'd be beyond hurt if he threw it back in my face just because I bought a slightly more expensive gift for a friend. The price of the gift obviously wasn't the point, it was how I found something I thought fit HIM, not just a race to buy the most expensive thing I could find."
780,"I haven't driven over yet. I didn't want to force anything if she really is just angry at us.

I'm not close to her father, but will contact him if there are no other options.

He is definitely not my ideal husband, but I've already spoken to Cherry about my opinions and she dug her heels in hard. I didn't want to end the friendship over that, so I simply said my piece and told her I'll always be there if she needs it. Assuming Adam is behind all of this, I guess I'm going to have to fulfill that promise (I do so reluctantly because I didn't ever want this to happen to her)."
781,"i think the phrase ""on my team"" has lost all meaning after reading all this.

&gt;She proceeds to try to argue over text with me during the closing show,  and I just read them and don't reply, trying to enjoy myself. I wasn't  trying to fight with her over text.

**You made a choice** **to ignore her**, hang with your buddy, and enjoy the show. She made the choice to leave you bc you were insensitive to her feelings and seemingly violated some boundaries. Period. It's pretty simple.

If she and her emotional state in that moment mattered to you, you would not have prioritized bro time with your friend at the concert. Let her find someone who prioritizes her instead of prioritizing looking cool and funny to his friends at the expense of making her feel uncomfortable and disrespected. You seem like a nice enough guy who is willing to look at your behavior critically, but there's a lot of immaturity in this situation and it seems like she is beyond over it. I would be, too.

789,"&gt;I cancelled my plans so I could stay home

Um, why didn't you just ask her to leave? She could have hung out at a park or coffeeshop until the guy came back, if she was staying over the weekend. And if she whined about you not trusting her, just say ""you're right, I don't trust you, you're a stranger"".

You canceled your own plans because of a stranger instead of asking her to leave! No disrespect meant, but that sounds absurd to me."

I would at least have to get an apartment with 2 bedrooms and that’s above $1000.  My son is already in daycare.   I’m looking into moving closer to my job so I won’t have to commute and save money there.  I just don’t want to leave and not be able to maintain my finances.

793,"So many men act like this about child support and it’s so ridiculous. I think this is the mindset: by asking for child support she is saying she doesn’t have enough money. If she has enough money for manicures, she’s using his money. He should have to pay less.

Even if the primary caregiver makes more money than the other parent, the other parent is obligated to pay some child support. Because both of them are on the hook for the child they created. If she’s getting manicures but her child’s needs aren’t met, that’s one thing. But he isn’t expected to give up all his income for his child, just a portion goes to child support. If he was told that he can’t buy video games because all of that needs to go to his kid, he would be appalled."

Same with children. Giving in after trying for an hour is the worst thing you can do and I see parents do it all the time. They mean well but then say their kid is uncontrollable. You just taught them if they throw a tantrum for an hour they will get what they want eventually. You meant to teach them that throwing a tantrum won’t yield anything. Instead you’re training them to not give up on those tantrums."
802,"&gt;my husband would absolutely defend me

Except he didn't. And hasn't since his friends started walking all over you. He's made plenty of excuses, though.

Keeping these friends in your home is going to destroy the friendship and your marriage. You shouldn't have to be a doormat to ""keep the peace"" with these assholes. "
803,"So two frightened, damaged children comforted each other for a moment, and your husband is making it about himself.

807,"&gt; He flipped out, tackled me on the bed and forcibly bent my fingers back to get my phone. He deleted all the screenshots and evidence.

Yeah that is a clear indication that you need to leave.  Not just leave him, but also remove yourself from his presence altogether (whenever it's just you two) because there is not telling what other sort of violent actions he'll do.  That's very noble of you not wanting to ruin her day, but is there someone in your family that you can talk to who won't blurt it out to others?  I really think you should have someone aware should this physical abuse still continue.  I am really sorry that you're going through this, OP.  I wish you all the best. "
808,"Honestly you shouldn’t meet him, he sounds weird and creepy and potentially predatory, as if he expects immediate sexual interaction and is trying to justify it by claiming to look for a serious relationship and “that’s what a girlfriend should do”. Big avoid imo."

811,"&gt; I don’t know what to do.

Break up with her. She's deeply insecure and every conversation on this subject will somehow turn into you being the bad guy because you ""don't value her feelings"" or something like that.

812,"Yes, at this point PLEASE show her the ring, tell her you were planning to propose during this trip, and tell her about how you talked to her dad about this in August, etc. - *especially* that. Are her parents together, would her dad have told her mom about this? in case you need corroboration that you actually did talk to her dad.

And please try not to be too upset with her."
813,"Yep, it's not okay to string someone along like that. Regardless of whether she means to be flirtatious because she wants OP or not, this is not what friends do. I make flirty jokes with my girlfriends plenty of times, but they're all married with kids in long-term relationships and none of us have ever gotten a ""maybe she's serious"" vibe from it. If we had, we'd know that we're close enough friends to address it regardless of current relationship status, because honesty is expected and appreciated in strong relationships!"
814,"Holy narcissism, Batman. Stay the course and keep not responding. This is what /r/raisedbynarcissists calls an “extinction burst.” She will go through rage, guilting you, bashing you to mutual acquaintances (hopefully not stalking), then eventually give up and move on.

816,It sounds like he might be into you. Maybe just start by asking for his number so you can talk outside of school or invite him to do something together with friends to feel it out a little more before directly asking him out. I think his answer to your dance question might just be him being inexperienced or insecure and I wouldn't take that as a sign he isn't interested in you. 
817,"I’ve been no contact with my family for +10 years and my life is infinitely better for it. I also had the same experience of other family members who were on the periphery of the abuse denying the validity of my memories: “oh, they weren’t that bad.” “You were just always an angry child,” “It’s not her fault, it was a very stressful time and you were a handful.” 
It’s AWFUL and selfish of them: they want to deny your abuse because it’s inconvenient to accept it as true. If your sister admits you were abused, she has to reevaluate what she’s labeled as normal and acknowledge that her/your parents are the type of people who’d emotionally abuse their own child. It’s easier to pretend you’re just difficult/unreasonable, so that’s what she’s chosen to do.  

Your cutting her out is 100% the natural consequence of her choosing to belittle and invalidate your pain so that she doesn’t have to face uncomfortable realities.  You’re making the smart choice to protect yourself by disengaging. 

Also, be **very** wary if she comes back into your life later and seems like she’s pushing extremely hard for you to get back in contact with your parents—sometimes when the ‘scapegoat’ child removes him/herself from an abusive family, the parents will force a formerly favored child into the scapegoat role (because for the family dynamic to function, someone has to be the ‘bad’ kid). If she seems angry that you won’t fall in line, consider that she might be feeling a bit of your parents abuse and is desperate for you retake your place so she can go back to being ‘the good one’ while you soak up the abuse. 

I hope you get the best revenge on your abusive family: a wonderful life full of people who love and value you and who help lift you up to your true potential. 

And on a practical note: Google Voice! After you change your number, if you need to be in contact with anyone you’re worried might give the new # to your family, use a Google Voice number with them instead! It’s like having a second line and will keep your ‘real’ number private.  It’s really cheap &amp; easy.  Just wanted to put it on your radar 😊"

While I wouldn't object to my children being religious, I personally couldn't handle teaching them that Creationism is not only a viable theory about the origin of life (it isn't) but that it's the ONLY viable theory.

823,"If she was a smoker, would it bother you?  Would you want to come home to it every day?  Personally, smoking is a dealbreaker for me, and it sounds like furry is a dealbreaker for you.  And that's fine.  I wouldn't confront her and go ""it's either the furry stuff or me"", because either she doesn't change and you don't have her, or she attempts to change and resents you for it, which is just as bad in the long run.  If this is a dealbreaker then I guess that's it for this relationship."
824,"How do you prepare? I'll share. 

First of all, if he *lays a hand on you*, you go to the police. Assault is a real thing, and he can be held accountable for this actions. This is real. 

Second, you tell him if *he lays a hand on you*, you will call the police. This isn't a threat, it's a promise. 

Third, his anger is an emotion and resisting his anger is creating fear. Let him be angry. Let him holler, moan, yell, do whatever he wants. These are his emotions, not yours. 

My father was verbally abusive and would try to scare me by yelling. I thought he was going to hurt me. I ended up going to a therapist, and he practiced yelling the words of my favorite song ""Summer Nights"" from the Grease soundtrack in his angriest voice. At first I was terrified, then I had a realization that words are just words, anger is just anger. I learned to yell the lyrics as well. Something I had never done before. I found my voice. 

The next time he yelled at me, I didn't argue. I yelled back ""SUMMER LOVIN' HAPPENED SO FAST. SUMMER LOVIN' HAD ME A BLAST. YOUR ANGER IS WORDS. WORDS! GO AHEAD, YELL ALL YOU WANT. YELL, YELL, YELL. IF YOU TOUCH ME I WILL CALL THE POLICE. I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GO TO JAIL.""

I never forgot that night, because I let my father know I was no longer afraid of him, his voice or his words. And I put him on notice that I would not tolerate any threat of violence. It was the last time he ever pulled that shit on me. 

OP, I was only 12 years old. He ended up leaving about 6 months later. But it was the last time he yelled at me.

828,"Exactly. Don't say anything. Words after years of acting like an asshole will be meaningless. 

It's a lot easier to be nicer then you think. All it takes is to take a moment and think about something from her perspective. Don't make a big production about anything. Walking with her instead of running ahead, maybe prepare some of her favorite foods some days. And more importantly, start talking to her like a person with who you like. Ask her about her day, her life, her activities. Ask her opinion current events or interests. Actually listen to her responses, process what she says and don't simply wait until she stops talking to say your part. After you've shown a pattern of change over time (weeks, not days) at that point it would be fair to give her a frank apology. "
829,"Because its their job to be polite, they can't be rude and kick out men as easily since part of their job is to provide friendly service."
830,This is extremely good advice.  You may need all the contact info for a future court case if he's a bit too unhinged and does something drastic.  Your memory will be completely unreliable and documenting each thing as you come across it will be perfect if it's needed in the future.  I am retired law enforcement and the above poster is spot on with the comments.  You should probably contact the police for an EPO (Emergency Protective Order) to make sure you're physically safe. 
831,"As someone else said, stop focusing on what your intent was because it is truly irrelevant. Whether you meant to or not, you hurt her feelings. My husband and I had a very similar fight(at least the core issue was very similar) shortly after we got married. We were talking about a town close to where he grew up. This town in particular exists in more than one state and depending on what one you're talking about, the name is pronounced differently. I am not from his state and as a result, I pronounced it the other way. 

At first this was just a playful argument between the two of us. However, later that night he was on the phone with an old friend of his and decided that it would just be HILARIOUS to recount the story to her. Despite the fact that he clearly wasn't doing this maliciously, it felt like he was mocking me. Also, I hate pronouncing words wrong, it's incredibly embarrassing to me and to have him repeat the story to someone else made it even worse. 

I had a similar reaction to your girlfriend. I teared up and he could immediately tell I was upset. He did his best to get off the phone quickly and the first words out of his mouth were like ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that"". If he had led with ""I didn't mean to"" or ""I was just joking"", it definitely would have become a much bigger fight. It's time to focus on what you did do and not what you were trying to do."

834,You've been together for almost 4 years and only see each other 2 or 3 times a month? Also no plans to even move in together for another 2 years?

836,"&gt; She didn't accept that as an answer and kept pushing the issue

Us women are raised to be passive and to blame ourselves for everything wrong in our lives. That’s why so many of us end up on this subreddit asking things like “my husband has literally never done a single chore and has no personal hygiene to speak of, but maybe it’s *my* fault for having standards?”"
839,"&gt;I want to repair the situation and prevent these incidents from happening again.


Realistically, do you truly think this is possible? I know you don't want to jump right to breaking up, but think carefully. You've already expressed your point of view multiple times, and he isn't going to change.


He puts you, and himself, in danger. He doesn't see a problem with it, and doesn't want to change.


Logically, how could you repair the situation and prevent it from happening again? There is no way to control someone else. You can only control your own response.


Personally, I would probably just leave *immediately* when I saw things start to escalate. If he's driving, I'd be prepared to demand he pull over as soon as there was somewhere safe to exit the car and call a cab - or better yet, refuse to get in a car with him to begin with. If he's escalating, I wouldn't bother to ask him to stop even once - I'd just get out and call my own *separate* Uber and end the evening immediately.


But wow, what a shitty way to have to manage a relationship. I cannot imagine staying for any length of time if I felt I had to go to those lengths. "
840,"Hi, not sure if anyone else is saying this, but protect your bank account.  "
841,"&gt;But he says they've been friends for 5 or so years and he would never cheat on me.

Fidelity is not just about love and sex; it includes establishing and maintaining boundaries that protect a committed relationship.  Your boyfriend is prioritizing these old friends over you in multiple ways -- he is giving them time he can't find for you, he is comfortable spending lots of time with people who are disrespectful to you and the relationship, and he is more invested in reviving their closeness than re-defining his relationship with them and growing your relationship outside of routine.   In other words, he's treating them as insiders and keeping you outside.

So no, your hurt is not irrational.  You are totally justified.  So much so, I would probably tell him that it's a deal breaker and set him free."
842,"That's scary. Has Adam given your other friends reasons why Cherry won't/doesn't want to talk to them? ""Looking too good"" is a really stupid reason to be mad at someone, I have to believe that's fake. "
843,"I feel like you're making this about yourself when you should be focusing on the needs of the person that just cut off two of her fingers. She didn't need you, she didn't want to deal with the drama of making you decide to leave your trip early, and as long as she's not then turning around and trying to blame you for not knowing, I don't think there's a problem. 

edit: I feel like I was a little harsh, but honestly, she's the one that experienced the trauma. just try not to be too hard on her about the way she dealt with it. "
844,"Are you really good together? Your marriage was so bad your counselor recommended he move out. You were separated. What are you hanging onto other than the length of the relationship?

This man knew your niece since she was a teenager, and chose to have sex with her. Don't you think you deserve better than that?

Edit: I'm bad at math."
845,"So...my son's best friend had a step dad like your husband.  It turned this sweet nice kid into a super angry violent depressed, suicidal mess who failed classes, got a juvenile record and is under court ordered therapy for CPTSD.  

Your husband is emotionally abusing your kid.  You married a bully and brought him into your kid's home and abandoned him to being abused. And I guarantee you that worse shit has happened that you don't know about.  Because your son KNOWS his mom doesn't have his back.  This is destroying your son.

Demand family therapy.  Stand up for your kid.  Or leave.  Or start saving up money for the therapy, drug treatment, or funeral costs."
846,"As a woman who owns a business in a male dominated field and who has an IT degree I cringe saying this so freaking hard:

What if you were to wear a ring, and also as someone else stated put a picture up at your desk of you and one of your girlfriend's.

The feminist me does not like this at all, but the fighter side in me understands the struggle you are having with missing out on important networking events simply because of who you are."
847,"Yeah, that's true. I probably would have come back early, and she probably would have felt guilty about it. I wouldn't have resented her or felt like she ""ruined"" my vacation, but waiting to tell me was likely the least stressful option for her."
848,"You should just ask him. He might just like displaying that he's an ally, or doesn't care if anyone thinks he's gay because he likes the shirt. He could also just be gay. You don't make a huge deal out of it, just ask him, and add that you are just wondering, you love him no matter what. 

If he *is* gay then you should then ask him what you can do to support him and how he'd like you to react. If he's okay with himself and educating himself, then there's no need to worry about it.  I'm sure you could also go to one of the subreddits for the LGBT community/parents with LGBT kids and ask if you get stuck.
"
849,I'm very sorry for everything that is on your plate right now. Much respect for staying strong. You and OP are in my thoughts 
850,"Everything that u/baffled_soap commented is spot on. I was your girlfriend, OP. I spent five years waiting for my boyfriend to find a job/career in his field, be ready to move in with me, propose to me and get a start on our lives together. He claimed he shared my life goals but it seemed like our timelines and expectations didn't match and I kept feeling like I had to prod him to get things going. Five years went by and none of those things occurred, and he was happily content in the relationship whereas I felt it was stagnating and not moving forward, in spite of me trying to communicate this with him over the span of years and his reassurances. In the end, words mean nothing, its the persons actions that are the most telling.

And the outcome? I ended the relationship back in June of this year because I was tired of waiting for him to get his shit together. 

&gt; Please reddit, tell me how to convince her, tell me what to do that our relationship is still good.

There is nothing you can say that will change her mind. Your actions need to do the talking now, because lip service and reassurances mean nothing if they aren't proven and followed up with actions."
851,"You are right! In fact that is what came to mind when it was mentioned here. I thought wow her flashing him is like me being flashed by a friend or family member of my husband.
I will rectify this! That’s unacceptable!"
852,"&gt; I am the kind of person that don’t like holding things back. I’m very honest and up front. I am definitely a confrontational person. When there is a problem I prefer to talk about it, sort it out and move on. I don’t hold on to things, I rather move past it and be done with it – BUT I do not ignore them! 

So you're an asshole?

This is a maturity thing- from your end. Mature couples choose their battles, they don't bring up every insignificant little problem. By bringing every issue up, you end constantly criticizing her, because no one is perfect 100% of the time. She doesn't take out the trash one day? Better have a talk about chores! She's looking at her phone and not watching Netflix with you? Better bring up her communication! Her hair is a bit messy? Can't let that one slide, better say something!

Let's repeat that one. You can't even let her have a BAD HAIR DAY.

It's exhausting and obnoxious. I promise you're not a perfect peach yourself, but the difference is that your girlfriend isn't haranguing you all the time about stupid shit.

Someday your girlfriend will find a guy who will support her and build her up, rather than constantly bringing her down. You should examine why a man a decade older chose to go after a vulnerable teenager that has a hard time standing up for herself. "

856,"Not really relevant, but I was raised with slot of skinship between family members. Kisses in the lips, hug, going around the house naked to get clothes or the towel, are still occurring things, even with my father. Neither of those things affected me (22 M). Actually, I'm more comfortable with myself than most of my friends, both physiologically and especially with my sexuality (straight).

Not even once I thought it was wrong, I just knew it was different from most families.

Late Edit: This ""skinship"" actually helped me construct a solid relationship with my family, to the point that things that occurs against them deeply infuriate me. Its weird actually, me being chill all the moments but something against my family its a different story."
857,"&gt;I can only work during the hours our child is at school and can't make too much or I'll screw us over on taxes.

Just to be clear -- that's not how taxes work.  If you go into a higher tax bracket, that higher rate only applies to the income you make above the lower level.  You never lose money by making more money."
858,"I think this relationship is salvageable, but only if the two of you really work at it. 

It definitely seems to me that you two either sell the house or get a divorce. If you get a divorce you'll be selling the house anyway- hell, you should just sell the house. 

Your wife resents not being able to stay at home and that resentment will never go away so long as things continue the way they are. You two need some marital counseling for sure, but your wife really ought to see a therapist or counselor to work through her feelings and maybe figure out if she's suffering from postpartum depression. Even if you two sell the house and move to something smaller, there will always be stressors and she needs to find a way to cope through the tough times.

At this point it's obvious that you guys need to do something different. You can't raise your child in a toxic home, and you don't want to raise your child in separate homes- you worry about the school district if you guys move but won't that be a problem anyway if you two divorce and sell the house? It seems to me like it's an inevitability at this point. So either change the home or change the relationship. 

For the record my parents were never together during my life outside of utero. I can't even imagine the hell my life would have been if they'd forced themselves to stay together. Make a decision about your marriage and what you guys are going to do before it's too late. "
859,"Perhaps Ben said something inflammatory, but, and maybe it's just because I am a decade older than everyone in the story, breaking someone's nose over inflammatory words is not okay. It's just assault. I would not want to be around someone so unstable.

It is not abusive to *you* OP, but it is not a good look at all. It makes Cody seem very immature and while probably not dangerous to you, dangerous to others. And, as someone who had a partner with a nasty temper when I was 18, it is not worth dealing with the immaturity and the fallout."
860,"Can we talk about her keeping her apartment as a backup plan? She's covering her ass while taking advantage of you and she is just expecting you to give her everything?
Does she even pay for something, since she is living with you or she can not since she's already paying for her own place?
Seriously, the hell? How is that fair that you have to pay more now because you're coming from a wealthy backround and why should you ""make it fair"" to her??
Also: why can't she fix her damn car?
I don't say that a lot but please BREAK UP! "
861,"Jesus, don't date this guy "
862,"He likes to pick fights, so he can vent his stress by yelling abuse at you.  He was trying to pick one by stopping the emojis, but you didn't bite, so he went ""you're angry right,"" and when you said no, insisted you were angry, and when that didn't work, insisted you were wrong for denying you were angry (lovely little catch 22 isn't it?  Can't say no, can't say yes) and kept on on picking at it until he could get what he actually wanted, which was to blow up at you and call you the most rudest person he has ever met and that your mouth is full of shit.  Nothing you could have done could have stopped him from saying that, because that was his intention all along, and he was determined to find a way to blow up at you - no matter what you did.

It's not your fault you sent a screenshot.  He gaslights and lies and makes you feel like you're crazy (saying you're angry when you're clearly not), so you sent a screenshot to try and re-establish reality.  Then he blows up at you ""how dare you try and contradict my gaslighting by reminding me what reality is! If I say X is the situation, that's what it is!""  

He's fucking with your head and verbally abusing you - you were right to call him toxic."
863,"&gt;I know she is overreacting but I can’t make her understand without there being tears in her eyes. We don’t even yell or anything it just starts happening.

Okay then just continue pressing the issue. Don't just drop it because she got teary eyed.

Edit: that is to say talk through the tears. Pretend that she isn't crying and keep talking about it."
864,"I agree that your wife is right and that once you make the house your own, the association will fade in time. Do you really think this is a patient who will stay on your mind for years to come? 

If the answer is yes, do you think you could try to re-frame the experience in your mind?? Instead of 'this is where my patient had respiratory distress' and 'this is where my patient died', think 'this is where I was able to provide the best care I could to someone who really needed it' and 'I'm glad I could be the person this family looked to for support in the worst time of their life.'

This is an event that just happened and the house is somewhere you will stay for potentially 30+ years. The memories of this patient WILL fade and so will the emotions associated with them. I think if the house is as perfect as you say, you should make an effort for your wife's sake.
"
865,I ain't saying she's a gold digger...
866,"And if she decides to divorce him (which I think she should), she should see a nutritionist  and lose weight for herself in a healthy way. Starving yourself and developing an eating disorder has lifelong consequences and can shape how you see your body even when you're  thin for a long time. I hope she's  able to see a therapist and I hope she doesnt become bitter towards her sister"
867,"He’s ascribing to the “i am a simple
Man unable to manage the emotions of others” and it’s BS. He will have to give himself more credit. He isn’t some simple man incapable of emotional support. 

You told your husband you wanted to kill yourself. He doesn’t need to be a mental health professional to know that “don’t do that” and “we’ll talk later” isn’t adequate. 

He fell into the “OP is a woman doing woman things and if she needs another woman *she can figure it out*”. And again: you don’t have to be a doctor to know PPD is serious (he can google) and puts you in a fog. You can’t do anything for you. You can’t plan anything new. He needed to step in and instead pulled the very outdated dude thing and figured you’d help yourself. 

Counseling. This can’t ever happen again, and it’s going to cause resentment. It’s not about punishing him. It’s about needing him to validate an experience you had, while very alone, and make it clear that his lack of empathy and willingness to step in while you were alone is still hurting. "

870,"Hi!   I’m from the other side of this equation - my parents are always the ones casually footing the bill for this kind of thing.

The best way to thank them is to thank them in words, sincerely, and then accept the gift.   They will love to be thanked, to hear your gratitude, but just the once is enough - bringing it up again and again will make them uncomfortable.   If they have offered to pay for your ticket, you having the ticket is what they want.  The best way you can show your appreciation is to enjoy having the ticket, enjoy the trip, without prostrating yourself over the generosity.   A host gift would be a lovely gesture - a bottle of wine or flowers and a card.

Take your cue from your boyfriend over money while you’re with his folks.   The culture is a bit different when there is money to spare - stuff like splitting a dinner bill doesn’t matter nearly so much.   It can take a bit of getting used to, and can feel very peculiar when you’re used to paying your own share 100% of the time.   Remember that if you’re treated to anything - including this plane ticket - it is their pleasure to do so, not a begrudging kind of duty.   That is, they only do precisely what they want to with their money, and that includes paying for their son’s girlfriend to join them. "
871,"She's still young, but old enough to know how to use her words. So she 'just decided not to go' to the interview - well, she could and should have made a phone call. You spent social (and maybe professional) capital to get her a foot in the door, and she simply blew it and then started crying when you tried to talk to her.

Then same with the laundry. You didn't ask her, she offered. If she couldn't do it, she could have let you know. 

It seems like her life is pretty easy if she can cry her way out any difficult conversations. Next time this happens, if you still want to stick around, you *carry on*. You keep talking. Don't stop the conversation to comfort her. She's either manipulative and will learn that it doesn't work or can't self-regulate well and acting like everything is normal will take the focus off her tears and back onto the original issue. 

If you don't want to stick around for this, though? You don't have to, and it's within your rights to decide that this is not for you.

Good look, OP!"
872,"Firstly let’s just say your looks are not an issue. All the small insecurities you pointed out are not valid - I have seen your photos - you are more than attractive enough to land a nice looking guy. 

Where your appeal falls over is all the other non looks related stuff - last update I saw you have no job, no money, no car and no education. Any guy who is evaluating you as a potential partner won’t care that you aren’t a CEO driving a Ferrari but they will care that you are doing nothing and that they will have to pay for everything. 

As a male I’d like a partner who has a job and earns money so we can travel together and one day start a life together. These things are important and the fact you are behind in these aspects of your life is a red flag for guys who want more than just sex. 

Why do you need a boyfriend so desperately? Everyone wants companionship but you were recently in a long term relationship where the guy totally screwed you over. Take a break for god sake and get your own life chugging along for a while. "
873,This is exactly how I feel. Especially because it involves her family I figure she didn't want to say anything to them. Pretty sure she'll be living without me. Sad part is I took her in my old place and have helped her to her feet in ways I can't even describe. I am between finding a place as it is living off a friends extra room for crying out loud

&gt;why wouldn't you cover up while walking around your family?!? It just seemed strange to me.

What are they supposed to do in a pool or at the beach? 

I thought that this was going to be a situation where they were walking around nude, but it seems that they're walking around in relatively standard amounts of undress for people who are related and live together.

878,Absolutely. Amazing that this entitled child has already decided what he will do with her inheritance. 
879,So very alone and lonely. I'm trying not to sob at my desk. 
880,"I live in a city with a very popular missed connections page and really wish they would be shut down. I used to work as a domestic violence/ sexual assault advocate and so many abusers would use that page to try to track down and harass the people they abused. The number of strangers who give out information like ""HER REAL NAME IS KATIE AND SHE WORKS AT THE PINE STREET LOCATION"" without thinking twice about the implications it is astounding. So for anyone reading this, don't do that.  I've had neighbors of domestic violence survivors leaving high lethality situations openly disclose things like ""I think you're talking about X who lives next door to me. We're in the Y building on Z street. She usually takes her dog to the dog park around the corner."" 

I think at this point it is perfectly reasonable to have him banned, have him escorted out when you need the table, or treat him as you would any other problematic lurking customer. At the very least, let your supervisors know so that if he tries to get more information about you out of anyone they are aware. It also may make sense to ask if you can switch to the other location temporarily (just a week or so) and then switch your hours when you return (again temporarily) in the hopes of confusing him about when you work (especially if he has already learned your schedule).  You can also consider having someone ready to walk you to your bike and meet you when you arrive (just in case) and to take different routes home or even stop by friend's places for a few hours before going home (in case he tries to follow you home) for at least a little bit. And it may be good to brush up on what protection orders are and are not options where you live in case things escalate and you need to obtain one suddenly.  Also let any other managers or higher ups take this seriously if they are willing to do so, even if the measures they suggest seem like overkill. It lets him know other people in addition to you are aware of what he is doing and see it as a problem and makes it clear that if he keeps escalating you'll have support in dealing with it/ he will be the one in trouble. 

It may also make sense, if you feel like it, to contact whoever runs the missed connections section and suggest they put a header above the section.  In my city, they get letters all the time asking them to include a brief warning asking people not respond with personal details about a person unless you are that person.  It doesn't help/ they have never put up that warning, but maybe where you live will be different.

Lastly, if your workplace doesn't have a policy to support survivors of stalking, domestic violence, and sexual assault and you are in a management position, maybe this could spur a discussion about creating one (in case you ever need it to benefit others in similar situations).  If you google ""workplace domestic violence policy"" there is a lot out there for different types of workplaces with information about what is and isn't reasonable in regards to safety planning, protecting privacy, changing shifts or locations, days off to move or go to court, etc.  If you're well liked and have been at your workplace for a long time, you might be in a good position to push this forward and create a written policy for whatever employee handbook or new orientation you have so that someone who hasn't been there ten years, isn't in their 30s, or might otherwise be more vulnerable, knows what they can and cannot expect in terms of support while working there.

No pressure, of course.  You've already got a lot of stress to deal with in this.  However, at least that way, maybe something good will come out of this creeps actions?"
881,"Jerks like this get me so angry. And sad for OP. It's the presumption of good faith, while the husband is acting *entirely* in bad faith, that's so painful. Here you are, trying to make your partner happy, cooking for them, doing chores to the best of your ability, holding up your side of the partnership, and all they're doing is undermining your efforts with criticism, irrational behaviour and unreasonable demands. You, still in good faith, think they wouldn't be doing that if there wasn't something wrong, because *you would never act that way*. You're doubling your efforts, with the same result. You start thinking that the thing that's wrong is not you or what you're doing but it's the relationship (OP is onto something!). But they deny that, because they don't want that conversation - they want the conversation where it's *your problem* and not theirs. If only you'd do better! So far this was really working for them: you were doing everything you could on your side to fix this ""problem"" and do stuff entirely to their wishes and specifications, and they could still unload on you sometimes and you'd think it was you. Win-win.

And you are, with your good faith, still thinking you're both working on an harmonious relationship.

It's the moment you start to realize that both your objects and methods are completely different, nay, even oppositional, and that theirs are actively harmful to you, that clarity sinks in and the healing process can start.

If you want to walk fifty miles a day, you can do it. He is not your keeper. He’s just acting like a jackass because his doctor said he’s fat.

Edit:  I'll just be blunt.  A friendship is only a friendship if BOTH parties have purely platonic intentions.  Agnes CLEARLY does not have purely platonic intentions, so this is no longer a friendship.  This is you being friends with someone who wants to be more than friends with you.  Continuing to spend ANY time with her alone is disrespectful to your wife and leads Agnes on."

893,"To be honest, being autistic never really bothered me until my girlfriend started using it as an excuse for my behaviour.

I didn't think I was that bad...

I would encourage her to see a therapist. You’ve got to have a serious talk with her and put your foot down. If she doesn’t apply to x places by y date, or schedule a therapy session by y date, then she has to find another place to live, such as moving back with her parents.

Walking on eggshells is torture. If you leave, he may realise and get help, people do change, but don't try to change him while you're still living in the situation.

 Get out. Get help. Please message me if you would like to talk.
