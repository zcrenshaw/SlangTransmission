0,"I mean, if he's using you is he REALLY that nice if a guy? Yeah he can be nice in other aspects, but using you (and that does sound like what he's doing) isn't a nice thing. 

If you want to fix it, you need to have a long talk with him about these problems before it gets worse. Like moving in and quitting his job and making you take care of him full time. But honestly guys like this don't really change, and if he does, it would be more likely to change on his own without someone to baby him. 
"
1,Doesn't matter who stopped it in terms of him being happy. Saying he was the one who stopped it doesn't mean he suddenly became asexual. 
2,I pray for you and your grandparents.
3,"I will give it a whirl, if nothing else itll be a good laugh?"
4,"I like this idea, thank you. I think this is what I'm going to do, we've had arguments over the cult so many times and it never goes any where, at least this way I can avoid conflict.

&amp;#x200B;"
5,"OK, first of all you weren’t brainwashed by your mother to believe something that’s not true, *your father IS your enemy*, he is very abusive and doesn’t sound capable of having a healthy, loving relationship with anyone. Second, you clearly have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other emotional problems that are caused by growing up in the environment you did. It sounds like you may come from a culture where this kind of behavior is normal to some degree, and it might be normal there but it’s still extremely emotionally damaging, which you are living proof of.

Please, please seek professional help before you get into any kind of committed relationship, and especially before you have children. Women who come from environments like this typically re-create them later on, despite their best intentions not to, and with the degree of emotional trauma you’re describing here you’re extremely likely to not even be able to get into a happy, healthy relationship at all without professional help. This is not something that can be overcome through sheer force of will."
6,I agree she doesnt.  But she doesnt have to go perform sexual acts on a webcam if she isn't in the mood for me.  We have a monogamous relationship so its not like I can just go fuck someone else.  If it were open I would see your point. 
7,"Don’t have unprotected sex with people you are very casually and non-exclusively dating, period. "
8,"She started pulling away as a defence mechanism. As another post said, it really doesn't take 3 - 5 weeks to organise a surprise party and it's like these girls haven't heard of a group whatsapp chat where they could have written things and not had to resort to whispering in the corner really obviously in front of OP. Don't get me wrong I agree that OP has insecurities that she definitely needs to work on, and she didn't handle the situation correctly, but I can 100% see why their behaviour started making her paranoid"
9,"maybe ask if he is really missing his friends, maybe yous can schedule a little vacation or get away to visit them for a long weekend? so that way you can support him in his element, get a change of scenery and bonding experience over a trip, while showing you care about him by letting him have space with his friends who live far away. just a suggestion"

12,"Do you want an honest opinion?

Your boyfriend is fucking weird."
13,"&gt; So we broke up, but when we did she said that I could always try to get back with her, since she still likes me.

So she broke up with you to see if you will fight to get her back?  That's not how healthy relationships work.  I would ignore it OP.  She should have been just there to discuss the relationship instead of just ending it to prove some sort of point or test the partner.  It's immature and not worth your time."
14,Why does there have to be a ring? My husband and I got engaged then got a ring when we had the money.
15,"I get what you're saying. There is a lack of interest on my part. When we were younger hearing him talk about programming was just a constant battle of staying alert and attentive. When he made friends, he got a lot more satisfaction in talking to them because they could really contribute. I could ask a few questions and make a couple empathetic statements. But that's all I could do. I know what he likes to do, I know what makes him happy. We just can't have real conversation about it. I dunno if that makes sense"
16,No do not pay off her loans. Everyone’s advice is great and I want piggyback off them that until you are married keep your finances separate. When you’re married then it’s your debt too and probably a good idea to settle on all debts. 
17,"first you made a promise,

then you broke that promise,

then you lied about it,

and it was all because of your selfishness

---

pretty a**hole thing to do eh?

---

the solution would be to stop being a 30 year old lying selfish a**hole"
18,I agree. I definitely would have felt a bit weird and like something was off.
19,"This is great advice. Definitely apologize! And explain why you felt so worried. But this is golden: 

&gt;USE this to your advantage to grow and get closer to these friends! 

Yes! And use this to understand yourself better and to be more likely to blow this stuff off in the future. Grow as a person. Don't let this become, ""because of my past, this is just who I am."" Nope. You can be better. 

Thirding the cake idea. A little self-deprecation is funny. Hopefully, this turns into a funny memory for everyone once the sitcom confusion was over. "
20,"I addressed this in a different comment, but like you've been together for *eighteen years*.  You should have more than a surface level understanding of each other's hobbies just due to the amount of exposure.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I meet someone new, and they do something I have no clue about.  I don't just sit there and stare at them!  I ask *them about it.*  I'm curious and try to *learn* about them.  Even if it's something I don't have an interest in.....clearly that person cares about that topic.  That empathy is what drives me to be curious!  It's not just about me.  You need to gain that with your husband."
21,"That is so thoughtful of you, that's a very smart idea. I'm going to start setting aside a little for when she passes, thank you for the advice, best of luck to you!"
22,"Thank you, you too. "
23,Oh just block her already. You don't owe her any explanations at this point. Get her out of your life so you can finally start moving on.  Why would you even consider letting her back in after how much better you are doing without her?
24,"Ugh, I'm sorry, that really sucks. At least the oldest only has three more years before he's free."
25,"To be completely honest with you, she has been putting you through so much pain and stress. As you mentioned, she verbally abused you. Under the influence or not, it’s not acceptable to verbally abuse anybody, especially the one person who cares for you and goes out of their way to make sure you are happy, which obviously isn’t working. Her attachment to her ex is another sign that this relationship is not good. She says she doesn’t want to hurt you, but she keeps doing these things that hurt you. In a relationship both of you have to give 100%. If not that means one is trying harder than the other to fit to the other’s needs. She’s used to being in abusive relationships, abusive family members, etc. That’s probably all she knew before she was with you. Since she’s used to that she feels like she needs that, even if she doesn’t like it. She might not admit that because she doesn’t realize it, but that might be why she’s reconnecting to the ex. If I were you I would stop playing into her games. She’s caused you enough stress, and that’s something you don’t need in your life. No girl is worth that much pain if they’re the one continuously causing said pain. You don’t have to put up with it. Plus, you can’t make someone change. They are who they are. It’s who she’s always been. Change in a relationship should come naturally, not forced. If she truly wants to change, which I don’t think she does, then she will. But otherwise, I think you are wasting your time trying to make it work. You can only do so much on your end. Stopping the alcohol is a good step, but can both of you commit to that is the question that should be asked. Can she have the self control to stop drinking, verbally abusing you, and messing with the ex or any other guy? You’ve let it go this far, if you do decide to continue, just be careful because you don’t deserve to be hurt anymore. You deserve someone that will go out of their way to make sure your happiness and needs are met. Good luck and I hope this was helpful!"
26,Make it a date? I'm sure the scenery is nice.
27,"Ask him why he started to do *that* and then suggest that he might put them somewhere else (not throw them away, but like put them somewhere else, maybe an empty room)"
28,"Exactly, The roommate wouldn't be in the position of paying alone for the care had she not been so selfish in the first place and driven OP away. 

Hey OP why don't you turn the tables on her and ask her for to contribute to your moving expenses. After all, its her fault that you are moving. "
29,"Personally, I think that's him saying that he refuses to try to fix those issues. He's not open to trying to communicate better. He's not open to even trying to learn. He's clearly not open to listening to you or respecting you. Once you're in a position where you've got problems and your partner refuses to work with you on them, what's left?"
30,Variables and expectations apply to everything. 
31,Why would you marry someone like this?
32,What values and beliefs do you feel pressured to change in order to land a relationship? If it’s something like you don’t want to have sex before marriage than definitely don’t compromise your convictions. 
33,Lol. Who made you the authority on how other people define family?
34,"Are you sure you want to have a child with this person?  Maybe you should try some couples therapy before actively trying to have a baby.  If there are things that are uncompromising for either of you, the could potentially be a deal breaker in the long term. "
35,"Why did you marry someone if you knew he wasn't someone you wanted to be married to? Like, you knew he played video games, and you knew you didn't want a husband who played video games as a hobby, so what were you expecting to happen? "

37,"Your mates are in love with a business model.

Let them remove themselves from your life for you."
38,"You've been together so long - have confidence.  You know!  Does she ever reminisce about a super romantic date?  What did she like about it? Can you replicate any of that?

Exciting is overrated (again, to me).  I like heartfelt."
39,"If you're going all out with the surprise party, you're already busy, and you're planning it in your spare time, it easily could take that long. Especially if they got into it and enjoyed themselves while doing it. It was probably a fun thing for them to do.

Also, if they were caught texting each other in a group that OP was specifically left out of, the criticism would be the same. The problem isn't that they need to carefully hide everything they do that doesn't involve her, the problem is that OP doesn't need to feel involved in every single thing they do. Even if it wasn't a surprise party, sometimes you're just not part of something. It's not personal, and OP needs to learn to react accordingly."
40,"Close your bank account and open a new one, she’ll be mad, but your freedom will be worth it."
41,"Cam work (and sex work in general) is extremely different emotionally than engaging in sexual activity with your partner. It’s almost like you’re a different version of you when engaging professionally versus personally. I would bet that most people have a “work self” and a “home self” and you definitely are your work self when on cam. It’s no longer a comparable emotional or even physical exchange as much as it is a performance. It’s shallow, hollow and unsubstantiated which it makes it much easier to do in a vacuum. There is no history, no expectation and no strings attached really. While you are certainly giving a part of yourself to the audience it’s not the same as interacting with a partner. She is wholly right to feel like the two experiences (camming versus personal life) are different. It also becomes really different emotionally when you can just turn off the computer and walk away. In a relationship you can’t really do that. 

I was a nude model (fine art, bodypainting and erotica) and did light sex work for years (cam girl, dancer, fetish model, sugaring, financial dom) while dating my boyfriend. (We have been together for 6.5 years now.) In fact, when we met I was doing this kind of work full time. There were times where I’d be done working and just too drained to do anything with my boyfriend. Even hang out. You know why? Because I was tired from work. Getting touched out it a real thing, even in jobs that aren’t as personally taxing as sex work. She deserves the space and break if she wants it.  

I would suggest that you take sex and sexual activity fully off the table as a bartering tool. It confuses the meaning for you both and creates a pressure chamber because then your girlfriend feels “on the hook” for something and you feel ripped off. What you really need to do is explore ways of more natural/less transactional ways to initiate sex. Moreover, it kind of objectifies your girlfriend...nothing about this arrangement seems to actually be working out for you as a couple. 

It also sounds like you haven’t really asked much about what your girlfriend’s sexual needs, likes and desires are. Incorporating that into your sexual experiences would make it better for everyone involved as opposed to just seeking a nut for yourself. 

Also, how old are you and your girlfriend? This is coming off as someone who is immature, impatient and selfish. I suggest you become more familiar with masturbation and different tools/techniques or leave and find someone who is very sex oriented as well if your needs are so intense. It is 100% valid to feel as if you are in a relationship that is not fulfilling your needs. But you either have to find someone that does or chance your expectations. You can’t make someone else change. 

Even then I would urge you to look at sex as a way to connect with your partner rather than a thing to be attained or traded. I would also encourage you to not feel so entitled to sex just because you are with a partner—they are there to be WITH you, not FOR you. You seem to have an expectation that you are entitled to sexual favors and that’s going to turn most people off. Surprise, even your girlfriend is NOT obligated to have sex or engage in sexual activity with you on your whim. It doesn’t mean she cares about you less, it means she is taking care of HERSELF. And if you can’t respect that you should do yourself both a favor and leave. 

I would also encourage you to deeply consider your language regarding this matter and what that really says about your perspective. You keep saying that is would “only take 10 minutes” to satisfy you. One, it sounds like it’s not that serious if it’s “only” going to take ten minutes. Sounds like something you should take care of yourself. Two, is it worth making your girlfriend actively feel uncomfortable or have to engage in sex acts she doesn’t want to do for something that warrants an “only”? Also do you really want to be having sex with someone that isn’t really into it? That sounds like the opposite of sexy to me. 

Tl:dr: grow up, consider other people, respect boundaries, buy a fleshlight. "
42,"Because children have a right to resources, cats dont"
43,"You're absolutely right. Many people don't realize how much they use the phone, or better said how annoying it can be to others when they use it in their presence.

I dated a girl for a few weeks. I actually complimented her on the first date because she didn't take her phone out even once, unlike my last few dates. However, things completely changed right after. She was absolutely nonstop on her phone, writing to friends. And even worse, she was the kind of person to be terrible multitasking. She would just take her phone out in mid conversation and drift to another dimension right away. This was the one major reason I broke things up.

You're not supposed to have to deal with this and it's definitely disrespectful behavior. 

"
44,"I wanted to hear opinions on my situation, if I am being reasonably upset or not. I have never experienced anything like this and it makes me uncomfortable to have to confront someone I care so much for, about this, also because I avoid conflict usually. But I know I can’t take it anymore and before speaking up I wanted to hear an opinion from Reddit:) "
45,"Break with her before she does it and salvage a modicum of respect for yourself.

Then tell fred he's a dick head for making a move on your girl.

Then tell his current gf."
46,Thanks.. and i mean that sincerely. I'm just in a position right now where leaving wouldnt be ideal for.my kids.. it's more so what he puts me through then the children.. I'll escape when I know I'll be stable enough to give my kids a great life without needing him.. I'm guessing it will take me about a year or so.. give or take.
47,"&gt;We used to when we were younger, but eventually we made friends that actually liked the activities we each liked, and those interactions were just more satisfying.

So....both of you like your friends *more* than each other....and you don't see how messed up that is?"
48,Same here. I'm into it anime/video games as well but this just...is a new level I'm not comfortable with. Even the figures I'm alright with but not like a huge frame that I have to always see...
49,No. Be who you are. Constantly trying to be something you aren't is exhausting and not sustainable. Be yourself and the person that is right for you will love you the way you are.
50,"Ah, my SO is a software engineer, but he's able to ...dumb it down...when he talks to me.  Focus on the concepts and big picture, not the details.  So this is also on your husband's end to meet you half way.  I'd say just talk about this.  That you want to connect more, but you both have to be involved in that process."
51,"Except, as you’re starting to realize, two unhealthy people cannot become healthy together. This is a toxic relationship. You both need to be on your own, and in therapy for each of your issues."
52,Ty for your insight. It really helps the struggle that is moving on.
53,"&gt; I really like the idea of helping her out in small ways along the journey to getting debt free.

Offer to match her contributions.  Whatever she pays in each month, you'll match it.

Yes, it will eat in to your savings, but so will gifting your soon to be wife 30k (yes, gift, because you don't loan your wife 30k), but at least this way it feels like you are working on it together rather than you just swooping in and solving everything."
54,"Fantastic!  For us, ""romantic"" meant a proposal on a rainy hike while trying to avoid other hikers because he didn't want anyone to ruin our private moment :)"
55,"How are you going to pay for this child? Lady, YOU need a job. "
56,"Ah, good to know. Maybe you're already doing enough, then. If you did want to take a larger share, you could also consider moving the rent split to 60/40 or 70/30. But honestly, you're already giving her a really valuable financial break, from the sounds of it."
57,I never threatened to leave the relationship. I told her that It was an issue and that we should address it.  Small issues left unchecked will snowball into bigger issues. thats not an unreasonable thing to say.
58,"Jail is still 100% on the table, I’m just offering to remove the immediate threat if he seeks treatment, gets a job and starts paying. Even if he seeks therapy and doesn’t start doing what he’s supposed to we will be back in front of judge asking for jail. 

Basically offering to reset court for 6 months later if he agrees, otherwise court happens in 3 weeks. "
59,What do I do about the facebook though? /s
60,"I feel the same way. Its bogus having to go on websites and try to fit in to these dumb categories.. However, if you wanna get people, you either have to really do a lot of searching in a huge area, or you just gotta be super fucking lucky, or you have to change your ways...

Im not willing to change who I am, because I know I will never be that fake person Im pretending to be, and if I have to pretend to be someone to find someone or get someone to like me.. Fuck them"
61,"You keep trying to be more and more understanding, and to shrink yourself down smaller and smaller, so that you won't upset or provoke him, but he is going to keep finding things to blow up over because that's what he wants. He wants to take out his anger on you. He wants to make you feel bad to make himself feel better. You could be a perfect angel sent from heaven and he'd find some reason to yell at you. 

You're in a no-win situation. You can basically try to not say anything to intrude in any way, and he'll probably get mad at you for not being supportive enough or something. I don't think there's anything you can do to actually make this work, because that's not what your boyfriend wants. He's determined to take things out on you no matter what. "
62,"&gt; My girlfriend has hinted at the idea from time to time, although I have never been completely sure if she was serious or not.

Long-term girlfriends don't just 'hint' this 'from time to time' if they're not serious."
63,"&gt;he gets youtube on and his air pods out to watch shows instead of just being in the moment with us.

OP, that is super rude of him. Very disrespectful behaviour.

&gt;He said he didn't want to be bored but he did put his phone away. 

Not to put words in his mouth but... did he just imply that being there with you and your toddler is boring? If so, that is pretty serious.


&gt;Am I asking too much? I feel its so normal now but I would rather spend some quality time with him when I don't see him often and I feel kind of hurt that he would rather sit around on his phone when we do get the time together. I have tried to mention it to him but the last time I did he said ""Why cant I look at my phone?

I'm only one guy all things considered in this vast world we live in but me and my GF don't use our phones when we are on dates. We talk, we laugh, we enjoy each other's company and we do stuff together. I understand what your boyfriend means by ""being in each other's presence"" from time to time (you're watching TV and he's on his phone maybe) but ignoring you over his phone while in a restaurant or something like that? Jesus no! That is rude and there is no other way to look at it.


&gt;Is this wrong of me? I don't want to be controlling or unhealthy about this in any way, but I can't help that it does bother me.

You're not controlling OP. You are a woman with a valid complaint that you would like addressed. Something you should talk with your boyfriend is **what** makes him feel bored when he's in a restaurant with you and your toddler.  Why can't he talk to you, play with your toddler or hell, show you something on his phone to start a conversation? You need this information before taking action."
64,"I don't want to guess her motives but I want to say this; Telling your partner you're going to leave if you don't get enough sex may have been a mistake. 

If I was her I might see that as a sign that your love is very shallow and I shouldn't trust our relationship to last.  For some people that could be a trigger to take a step back from the relationship and sex.

Or maybe she's not satisfied when you do have sex... That would kill anyone's libido."
65,Not to mention that cats are territorial creatures and moving them around often causes them undue stress. 
66,"It can be hard, and he certainly needs support but you don't need to take the brunt of his lashing out in anger. It's definitely taking a toll on you, too. "
67,"My line of thinking, in my mind, was the 30k would be being paid back over time (if all went as planned). But if I took on rent by myself, and if it takes 2-3 years for her to wipe her debt alone while not paying her half of rent...I'd be paying $28,800 for 1 year. Which, in that case, i might as well just give her the 30k up front and not expect it back,yaknow? So thats what I was getting at, sorry if that wasn't clear."
68,Very romantic! I think it's a great idea. I also think some lights would be a cute detail to add.
69,"So as you are obviously aware, this is a huge red flag and if you want the relationship to continue and be healthy then something must change. I'd recommend talking to him or better yet writing out a letter so you won't be interrupted, you can lay out all your talking points and examples and let him know how you'refeeling. Let him know you are not his mother, this is behavior that he needs to be aware of and remedy when situations arise in the future, I know it may seem obvious to you but he is probably genuinely blissfully unaware of the impact this is having, if he is even aware that he is doing it. It's very easy for people on the internet to hear a story and say end the relationship. But relationships take work, compromise, and a lot of open communication. If you are willing to put in the work, talk with him, and help him better himself and the relationship, then do so. But be aware it's a two way street. If he doesn't want to compromise, pull his own weight and  be vocally thankful for what you contribute to the relationship; then you need to decide if this is the type of life you want to live and if this is the kind of person you want as your partner. "
70,"First thought: No, absolutely not. Her only bill outside of the debt is half the rent already. That's uh... more than generous. 

Deeper consideration: If you're joining your finances anyway, then all the interest she'll be paying towards this will affect you regardless. So I can see why it would be a net positive for you as a couple financially. 

What I think you need to consider is whether her debt is the result of bad luck or bad choices. From the information you provided, I can't tell. The IRS bill? I'm confused at how that happened without someone making really bad choices to avoid understanding how taxes work. A friend of mine got REALLY screwed when her employer did not take taxes out of her pay check for a full year. I felt bad for her, but as a late 20s adult, I can't really absolve her of guilt because how the fuck do you not notice something like that? How do you not look at your paystub and realize the deductions aren't there, or aren't enough to cover what your taxes should be?

Same with the credit card debt - if it's from a time when she had a shitty salary and couldn't make ends meet, or had extreme car/medical/pet emergencies then I'd be willing to say, hey shit happens - you got dealt a shitty hand and since we're partners I will help if I can. But if none of those factors are the case, I don't think she should get the bail out. 

If you do decide to do this, then 1) I would only pay the things that DO have extreme interest rates, like the credit cards 2) don't expect her to pay you back, or if you do get that shit in writing and notarized (or whatever the most professional/legal way to codify a personal loan is) in case your relationship ends 3) remember that you have 30k worth of debt too... Unless you have penalties for early payment, why aren't you caring about your own interest? 

&amp;#x200B;"
71,"Where can I chased in on this guarantee of yours? I can guarantee you I, and most people I know, wouldn't have felt anything close to what OP was feeling in the same situation."
72,She isn't promoting his bad behavior shame on you for turning this around on OP. No reasonable person would put up with this mans behavior. I guarantee he knows better and just doesn't care. 
73,"That is precisely my thought process. 

I don’t think he will agree either, but perhaps his spineless parents will borrow mine and throw hands up and go “oh well, you’ll have to go” 

Tiniest chance it might improve the situation and nothing really lost outside of time"
74,"This is too much work for someone who will apparently be too selfish to even consider treating you like anything but a bang maid. End it, you can do better. "
75,Totally. When it comes to responsibilities/chores he remembers OP but when its time to treat he thinks of his mom. Lol
76,"Can you give a concrete example? It might help to see how far in each direction each of you has to compromise, for healthy communication.


I may have advice, as this sounds exactly like my husband and my dynamic, only with roles reversed."
77,"Nope. Definitely not okay. And the way to deal with it, honestly, is to move out."
78,You can't break up with someone and not hurt them. It's like asking how do I stab someone without making them bleed.
79,Stop being soft on him and enabling his horrendous behaviour. Jail was made for people like him. He needs real consequences. Since when in all this over a decade of time has he ever responded positively to anything he wasn't forced into? Send his ass to jail. Your children need that money.
80,"I have a similar situation to you, my abuse was pretty traumatic and I've been in therapy since I was about 22, I'm 32 now. I cut my mom off with the support of my therapist, friends, and family. It is the best decision I have ever made for myself. It feels good to tell your abuser they have no control over you, your life, you choices, your beliefs, your clothing, anything. I'm not saying you should 100% cut her off but I am saying that being around her physically is putting yourself ina dangerous situation. "
81,Not an option for me. 
82,"Realizing that is a start!  Therapy is also great.

&amp;#x200B;

But what this comes down to is trying to actually connect with each other.  Sit him down and communicate that you are worried about this!  That you want to be closer emotionally.  If he just says ""nah it's fine"", then *challenge* him on why he won't open up.  "
83,"It is valid for him to have that as a boundary and to ask for it. I would consider that a huge point of incompatibility and end it at the casual dating stage they’re currently at. Some people, like myself — and it sounds like OP’s current romantic interest — do not feel the obligation/desire to sleep with every man and woman we spend one-on-one time with and I personally find it really creepy when someone thinks that I do. "
84,"He is lashing out inappropriately. I can speak from experience, having lost my mother, that it is a pressing time and it won't get any easier without help. He needs to learn how to cope without destroying the relationships he does have."
85,"&gt; She says it would be the worst mistake she ever made because she has put around 9000 in the house over the 5 years.

Is that the total amount she has paid? Because that's almost nothing. That's $150 a month. If she actually lived in the house for, say, two years, and paid $500 a month for those two years, that would have been $12k and in return she would have gotten housing. Walking away from a $9k ""investment"" in her housing for five years is nothing."
86,"&gt;They have wandered into emotional affair territory

No they have not.  An emotional affair is where the unfaithful person is relying on another for things they should be relying on their spouse for exclusively.  Talking about music or sharing a hobby is nothing something exclusive to a spouse.

There may be issued with the amount of time Kevin spends with Alice vs. the amount of time Kevin spends with OP, but that can be addressed separately without (wrongful) accusations of emotional infidelity.

Yours and so many other comments reek of bias from someone who has been cheated on in the past.  These people have been best friends for 10+ years and LIVE NEXT TO EACH OTHER.  You need to take a step back and look at things objectively before giving advice."
87,"This is terrible advice. I would never allow my mother to abuse my daughter mentally, emotionally, and physically the way she abused me and my siblings. I would have to be a shit parent to force my family to be in contact with a known abuser. My dad sexually abused my little sister, should I stay in contact with him? Hell, maybe I should let him babysit my daughter! That sounds like a smart idea."
88,"I know it’s the case in my state and every state I can think of, but of course I don’t have child custody cases in every state ;)

The case history at this point (while tedious and expensive for me) is building a clear history of his failures as a parent as well as an adult so if he ever does ask to increase his visitation the judge will not allow it.

He’s already at the lowest he can have unless he commits horrible acts (abuse, chronic drugs, etc) around kids or voluntarily gives up time. 

My issues stem from him thinking he is the better parent so I’m always looking over my shoulder for danger when it comes to his actions. 
I kept my youngest in daycare until he aged out this year out of fear of my ex complaining I was neglecting my kids by allowing them home alone after school at 14 and 11 (now 15 and 12) etc. stuff like that. "
89,"My friend suggested that we go to WY this summer so we drove 3 hours and ended up trespassing in an wildfire ravaged forest without realizing. 

They ask you to pay a small fee to enter their parks and on the registration you put the name, plate number, and address of the car owner. 

The penalty for trespassing in an area like this in WY amounts to a fine of about $5k. We did not realize this until I had flown back home.

I didn’t think twice about offering that $2.5k. I was a part of the decision that led to that fine and I don’t like the idea of putting someone in a bad position for no reason other than to benefit myself

Not saying you have to help this kid, but I guess it all depends on your morals
"
90,That's not how that works AT ALL. You seriously think it is not revenge porn just because the person posting it is in the video? Lets see if anything else I read or hear today can top how dumb that is. 
91,"I was in a position close to yours a few years back.

Honestly, I kept it cordial but didn't really talk to her outside of niceties.  Short, simple answers to whatever questions she asks, not responding to anything that doesn't *require* a response, including all digital communication.

If you're chilly enough with her, eventually she'll stop trying to reach out.  Unfortunately, my relationship with my friend suffered for a little while and I didn't get to see him as often.  But they broke up after a while and we got close again."
92,Then that's something that you need to talk to him about. If you both want it to work then it will. When you let things fizzle out it just takes time and practice to bring it back.
93,This might be the worst advice I've seen on this subreddit. 
94,I also thought this as well. He says her highest card is at 8k. Maybe knocking down that one or the other smaller ones would be a good first step. Psychologically knowing that an account is cleared can really help. 
95,"&gt;we've delved into our interests and have a hard time finding common ground with each other. 

And I'd argue that this is just laziness/indifference.

&amp;#x200B;

In grad school, one of my mentors made a point that has always stuck with me and applies to so much in life:  If you are unable to explain your work/ideas/etc to someone that is outside of your field then you *don't actually understand what it is you are explaining.* If you rely on the minutia and use of technical terms....you don't actually understand it.  

Me and my SO do very very different things career wise as well as hobbies, but can still talk about it!  I take an active interest in what he's into and ask questions.  As he does with me!  Are you unable to *learn* about each other???  You say he plays games....have you ever asked about said games?  I play, my SO doesn't.  I still can talk to him and he jokes about me and my horse obsession in RDR2.  He knows nothing about games, but can still remember that it's a cowboy game and spend most of my time finding new horses than actually robbing shit!  

I just....can't imagine never actually talking to my SO in a way that asks what's going on in his head.  I mean....don't you care what he thinks about?  "
96,"Honestly I can't really understand all those people who tell you to ditch him. Of course this is unacceptable behaviour, but damn, talk to him! In a relationship you're meant to learn from each other, too. If he has not learned it already at home it's bad of course but tell him what he is doing wrong so he can adapt and change. Else he never will. If he doesn't, okay, leave him, but I feel like I would want my partner to talk about issues with me instead of dwelling on them and just waiting till love expires."
97,He's already paying for everything but rent. 
98,"We're not religious, but it still feels like we're doing something wrong. "
99,"Love alone isn’t enough to keep people together. She really needs help and I agree she probably is already attached to you but you shouldn’t put up with this feeling just to make her happy. I spent 8 years doing that for my ex and it all bit me in the ass in the end when he turned abusive (not saying you are, I’m just showing you how much of a waste of time it is to try to fix someone who doesn’t want to get help.) "
100,"Because she’s taking an adults money without consent. If this were the child taking money from the parent, you wouldn’t find that acceptable. 

Theft isn’t acceptable regardless of whether it’s a parent or not. "
101,"If you want this relationship to last, have a conversation with him. Use your words. Point out everything that you did in this post. If doing that face-to-face is uncomfortable for you, send him an email first and then sit down to discuss.

Ignore everything that he says. Everything. But pay attention to his actions. If you don't see a 180 change in his actions, then end it immediately.

That's if you want this to work. You'll find out quickly whether he's someone interested in doing the necessary work to make this relationship work for YOU beyond 3 months.

All that said, the Valentine's Day behavior is enough to warrant hitting the eject button on this jerk. Yes, Valentine's Day is a commercial, made up holiday, but if you're dating someone it warrants a conversation.

""Hey, personally, I think Valentine's Day is a made up holiday, but I wanted to check with you on how you like to celebrate that day."" He didn't have that convo with you. He doesn't give a shit about you and your feelings and what you might have thought about that day. That's enough to hit the eject button and watch as he flies out of your life. "
102,"Didn't even think about these, great idea, thanks!"
103,"Only you can say if it’s worth it. But i personally say that if this is a dream of yours, then it’s a big part of who you are and who you want to become, and it’s sad to let anything get in the way of fulfilling something or someone you always wanted to be. His dreams sound pretty much done; are yours? Are you making yourself smaller to make him feel bigger? Who could you be if you let yourself try?"
104,"That's a very good script that u/shymartin should follow.  It's simple and doesn't leave much room for argument.  She's also worried about ""confronting"" him and your language is pretty tame, on a conversational level "
105,"Sorry your drug deal fell through.  Did you really think posting this was a smart idea?  Maybe you need more than half the shipment, actually.

107,"Time to sit down and have a talk with your husband. It definitely sounds like he is upset about your promotion and it kind of comes off like it could possible be jealousy, resentment, or something along those lines. How is his job situation?  I'd point out your observations of him at dinner and then him focusing on who came up with the idea first rather than how you have worked hard to get this promotion. Express how it hurt that he didn't seem happy for you or proud. Ask him why he fixated on who came up with the idea, and what he was trying to accomplish by doing so. Does he want some kind of credit? Does he think *that *would outweigh everything *you've* put into your job? It just doesn't make sense which is why i'm wondering if your promotion is making him feel insecure about his own job and/or accomplishments and he's taking that out on you. "
108,"I've considered both of us going to a fiduciary for advice. Definitely couldn't hurt. I do have interest on my school loans. I pay about $160/mo right now, but plan to start paying it off in 10k chunks (but had a goal to hit 100k first, which will happen by the end of this year at the rate I've been saving). That could be a whole other topic, but I steered her away from debt consolidation because we don't have a proper understanding of it. I fear that there is some hidden interest that will only make the situation worse. But some professional financial advice would clear that up, and questions I have about my own finances, so thats some great advice. Thanks for droppin' the knowledge."
109,"I'm sorry to hear about your mothers condition, it sounds like you handled it very well. Thank you for sharing your experience and offering advice. I think I will speak to her about doing something similar just to be safe. Thank you again, best of luck to you!"
110,Stand your ground. Dont let others push you around in your own home.  I'm sure your boyfriend will understand.  It's obviously a reoccurring problem.  Maybe his friend needs an intervention for his drinking problem.
111,"Eating the same thing for a whole week is different from NOT eating which is something many families deal with. This may not be his situation either, but something to consider."
112,"One of my most prized possessions is my grandmother's first engagement ring. It's a small blue gemstone (her birthstone I think) in a delicate gold band. They were 20 years old and broke. He did upgrade her ring to a big diamond band later in life when they were financially stable. You don't need a big rock when you are young and just starting out in life, there is plenty of time for that in a long marriage. I hate the idea that of waiting to get engaged or married due to money. Don't put your life on hold because of a piece of metal or a big party."
113,"Spouses don't have to be best friends or at least not exclusive friends.  Hopefully, there are things that bind your marriage that Kevin doesn't have with other people -- intimacy, understanding, communication, life goals, possibly children or plans for them.

Imagine instead of Alice, Kevin was going over to hang out with Jason all of the time.  You probably wouldn't feel the same level of jealousy; but you would have an expectation that Kevin balance his time with Jason and his time with you.  The same applies here.

It's unfair to assume both Kevin and Alice will break their vows just because they get on well as friends with shared interests.  Marriage is a lot more than just doing activities together.

My girlfriend has a lot more in common with her female best friend than she does with me.  But, when the chips are down, I'm the one she confides in and whose opinion or help she seeks out.  I'm the one she relies on and the one who will be there for her no matter what.  Hopefully, Kevin would say the same about you."
114,I'm really afraid of that. I just don't know what to do. 
115,"...yeah, obviously it is possible. You’re focusing on the wrong thing here, though. 

You confessed your feelings to her and she did not reciprocate them. If she wanted a romantic relationship with you she would have told you that she felt the same.

Stop trying to “get it out of her”. Stop trying to guess at her feelings. You two are friends. "
116,"Apartments/condos/townhomes anytime you share a wall with some random person it is absolutely going to suck. Renting is a waste of money, you are basically throwing away money to live in a loud shared shithole. Homes in subdivisions with HOA's are better  but still suck ass in their own way. I've lived in an apartment below a family of what sounded like 30 and lived in an HOA house that told me what color I could and couldn't paint my front door and couldn't park my pickup truck in my driveway. Humans weren't meant to live in such close quarters with random strangers. I now live in the outskirts of the city on 40 acres. I can never go back to anything else. I have no restrictions and cannot see another house. I have seen the light. "
117,"I mean, you can always try to make her jump back into a relationship with you, but it will most likely fail again, thus preventing you two from trying again in the future, when there’s an actual chance for your relationship to work. It’s not about what she wants, it’s about what is right for the two of you. She’s not doing it to make you feel miserable. Accepting is great, but understanding her decision would be even greater. The people we truly love, we want them to be happy, or at the very least a little less unhappy. "
118,"In my relationship, I (F) am the less emotionally available partner. It just doesnt occur to me to talk about ""deep"" things, and it makes me uncomfortable when others open up about heavy topics. Over time, it has become a problem because my husband doesn't feel heard or connected, so I'm working on it in therapy and with him. 

You might want to check out Adult Attachment Theory and see if any of it resonates. If your boyfriend is the ""avoidant"" type while you want deeper connection, it's probably going to become a problem over time. From experience as an avoidant myself, it's a tough thing to grow beyond. "
119,You already know the answer to this dilemma. GET YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT. You are an adult. She is an adult. She will keep taking from you unless you grow a pair and protect the money you earned. If you can’t muster up the courage to do that then frankly you deserve to get your money taken and then you can both be poor. 
120,"&gt;sometimes the bedroom can feel cliché

That's a good point--it can give the message that sex is expected, which might not be the message you want to send sometimes. "
121,"While it might seem like these things should be obvious to you, it sounds like you're trying to just psychically beam your needs out to him rather than actually communicating about what you want and expect out of a relationship.

&gt; He is in no way ever rude to me or anyone. 

Please recognize that a lot of the behaviors you are calling out here are, in fact, rude behavior. While it seems like it's very low stakes stuff, it's clearly adding up and wearing down on you for him to just take your things and act like he's entitled to your stuff. While he might be unobtrusive these don't sound like actions that are rooted in kindness and consideration for you, but instead in his own needs and wants. IDK, it seems like you're conflating quiet a little too much with nice when they're not the same thing at all.

If your'e invested in this relationship and want to see it continue, then you need to communicate about what you want and set your boundaries. Maybe he just needs to spend less time at your place for a while, just have that one date night out where you split 50/50, let him know that you want to see some consideration and effort from him.

TBH, he's 30 and this is pretty basic stuff. You can tell him that he needs to rise to the occasion (even if it's not about buying stuff) but what's your plan if he carries on like this?"
122,"It's hilarious to make this comment when your ego was too fragile to handle people telling you you were in the wrong, so you had to delete the whole thing. And you felt the need to blurt out ""I'M AN ENGINEER."""
123,Are you responsible? Yes. Directly.
124,Thank you. You understood my point.
125,We have had plenty of sex in the past haha
126,"I dated one of these. We ONCE went out for a nice meal and afterwards he was clearly so upset that he had had to spend that money and couldn’t even admit that to himself when I called him out on it. There were other issues too but when I broke it off he tried to buy me jewelry to win me back.... but here is the thing. It isn’t about the material item its about the desire to take care of the other person, to see them smile, to make them happy and safe. He is thinking of his wallet over your happiness and that is not something you can change. So if you do decide to talk to him I suggest saying that he thinks of his own comfort over yours, not that he doesn’t spend money on you. And I would probably say “hey if you want a serious relationship with me then I think lets take a few weeks off and you can think about if you seriously want to take care of me or if you just like that I take care of you”. 

You sound a real catch, don’t be with someone who wont throw their wallet in a river for you. "
127,"That's a pretty cute idea too, OP.

Your proposal idea is awesome. Good luck with the details"
128,"Yeah, pretty much. If you really feel you should try to keep in touch, you could try establishing contact after you talk it through at length with a therapist about how to set boundaries, how to let go of letting her crap hurt you, and even then meet only on your terms. But until you put in that prep work I would go no or very low contact.  She isn’t going to change; you can only change how you deal with her. "
129,Thanks!
130,That’s how I see it. I’m sure OP was extremely generous at first and WANTED to buy him food and make him happy. He might just not notice that it’s agitating you. You have to say something.
131,I hate when people use religion as an excuse to belittle and humiliate and just generally be assholes to others I was born and raised as a Catholic but I would never use my religion as a reason to be mean and spiteful to others I think you should move out when possible and cut contact with him he will never change 
132,"Makes me wonder how much money they’re spending on the cat??? 

My cat sees the vet annually, which for a check up is &lt;$100. I buy her nice food which is about $120 for 30lbs (two different kinds of food). So that’s about $220/year. Add in about $30/year for treats and small amounts for toys. I’d say I spend around $300/year on my cat. "
133,"&gt;I personally wouldn't recommend wiping out here debt like that or giving her a huge lump sum, I would just help more with the day-to-day things so that she is able to save more of her own money.

This advice right here. Take over paying a couple of the shared bills to help her free up some money to attack her debt. If things go south, you'll feel much less resentful about taking the lion's share of household expenses for things you're using too than if you gift her cash outright that you may never see again."

136,"I don't need to go on some big ""Queer eye for the straight guy"" thing to know that I don't like it. 

I. Don't. Like. That. Style.  

I don't understand why this concept is so hard for people like you and her to understand.  I've made it very clear that I don't want to dress in the clothes that she picks for me.  If I told her to change her apperance, and she said No, then I would respect that.  Why do I have to go on some fashion montage shopping spree to get my point across? "
137,"I don't think it's that.  OP sounds considerate and that she likes cooking, so it may have started out innocuous enough.  She offers leftovers once, or orders take out and is a good hostess and offers it to him.  Then the next time he just takes it.  

It was offered before, right?  So maybe it is always on offer?  And OP never says anything , and her silence can come across as acceptance or encouragement.  

I agree he's a mooch, and 3 months is far too soon to be ""in love"" with an issue like this.  But I don't (yet) think he's a **malicious** mooch.  For all we know he's saying to people that his gf is just so awesome and generous, always making sure he has food and providing for him.  

It's wrong of him, but until she lays down boundaries and sees how he reacts, she won't know for sure if she should keep him around.  "
138,"I was going to say what is he actually doing on his phone. If he just looks at it every few minutes he probably just has a phone addiction. like most of the population.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah putting a show on when you're out together with your toddler in public. thats weird af i dont know why someone would do that"
139,"It’s probably not a good idea to do it before marriage, too many stories like that end up badly. 


But besides that, you want to “loan” money to your future wife? How soon do you plan on getting married? How exactly do you see this playing out?! “Hey hon, your monthly loan payment is due, don’t be late this time or I’ll repossess the dog! Make sure to include interest.”


You do realize that as a family, you will be one financial unit, right? Sure, many couples keep finances separate, but you are still one unit. Say you want to buy a car, house, furniture, a nice trip, etc. are you going to tell your wife she can’t use it until she pays off the debt? Are you going to tell her she cannot keep the money she earns until it’s paid off? Gonna have her live in the garage until you’re squared up? What would stop her from simply saying “nope”?


You should ask yourself these questions before you make a decision. You sound like a good person who is genuinely looking for a loving, lasting marriage. If her debt is a deal breaker, then so be it. But for the love of all that’s good, don’t “loan” her $70k. That’s a one way ticket to divorce town down the road. "
140,"You need to talk this over with him. Stop paying for all of these if you must. Make a schedule for grocery shopping. (With a list so it doesnt get uneven again). 

This is not okay."
141,"Thanks for your opinion! I might tone it down a little since we are usually not the most romantic people. But yeah, the bedroom is not a good idea, as was discussed in other posts."
142,"Originally the fact that we were different attracted us to each other. Now that's changed a bit. We've delved into our interests and have a hard time finding common ground with each other. We do talk in bed on occasion, mostly about family and things though. "
143,But she doesn’t know that OP hates them. In fact OP literally states that they do the exact same thing to her. So by your logic aren’t they both bad partners?
144,"As a fellow rejection-fearer, it's easy to feel like people are putting way more mental energy into us than they are. It's easy to imagine resentment growing as years pass without any contact.

The reality is that she'll probably be glad to hear from you. The worst case is she'll be to busy to truly rekindle the friendship, or too consumed with the life she's built from herself, but she'll probably still be glad to hear from you."
145,"Have you told him this is unacceptable behavior? If not, that's your first step."
146,Fiancé and I BOTH got a ring. We both paid half (even though his was a bigger size and technically more expensive.)
147,"Here's a longshot...  Have you actually taken the time to tell them this bothers you?  What was their response?  You don't mention that you've communicated any of these situations or feeling to him.     
  
It is frustrating when things don't feel equal, however they never will be if you don't talk about it and come to some sort of understanding and work towards a middle ground.  Compromise and communication are largely what a relationship is all about.

"
148,"The way you describe how YOU want him to grow up... is pretty concerning. It sounds like when he doesn’t tell you that his goals are what you wanted them to be, you just accept it and think he’ll change his mind?? You cannot be doing that!! If growing up to him means dealing with his anxieties through painting first, then he is at liberty to do so. He was successful at what he was doing, and the pressure of what *you* wanted for him deteriorated that, and now you’re frustrated at him for not earning what he did before? That’s not really cool either. 

In all, It seems you have very fundamentally different ideas on what “success” and “growth” is, you seem to think it’s measured in a career, it doesn’t seem he thinks the same way. That will not be a good foundation to continue to build on unless BOTH of you communicate on how to go about addressing it. "
149,[removed]
150,"Yes. It is his first relationship, she needs to open hermouth and tell him what she dislikes. I dont even know how this topic didnt come up when she first went to buy food with him? A simple, ""we are splitting the food bill 50/50, are you okay with this?"" would have established a better dynamic and not enable him to continue letting her pay for it all. At the same time she would know in that situation by his reaction if he really is greedy or if he just didnt think far enough."
151,Christ almighty. It’s time for him to grow up. Stop being a doormat and letting him walk all over you!  Explain that the way things are going is no longer working for you. Stop making him dinner every night. Stop allowing him to do whatever he pleases with your food. He’s your boyfriend not your child.

155,Don’t be surprised if your husband ends up cheating. I wouldn’t blame him if he did.
156,"&gt;  Especially when I was the sole reason for the loss.

No, you weren't. You repeatedly expressed your discomfort and he repeatedly ignored it. You decided to take action that would respect your boundaries and that is well within your rights.

It sounds like it is the feeling of friendship that you miss and not that particular friend. You have romanticized your previous friendship way more than you really experienced it. You need to remember all aspects of the so called friendship so you can analyze it from an objective perspective. Stop reminiscing on the highlights and see it for what it was.

It is time for you to force yourself out of your comfort zone and look for new activities that will widen your social circle. If you return to this friendship without the issue being resolved, you will just set up a precedence of being a doormat where your boundaries are constantly crossed and you accept it.

You stood up for yourself, stand up to your decision to stand up for yourself. "
157,Why not? You'll never know unless you try. Good luck OP :)

160,"&gt;He is nice, genuine, calm, funny and very introverted

He may be calm and funny, but he's not nice or genuine to be treating you that way."
161,"So if the shoe were on the other foot and the cat was mine, it proceeded to bite and hiss at her while she removed it from the refrigerator and she kicked it out of the house it would have been an acceptable practice to punch her in the face, and would have been unacceptable for her to grab my hands and put them at my side?

Just clarifying your perception is all."
162,"Hey there. Don't let other people force you to avoid going no contact. Almost all of your good friends will understand: it's not like that would be uncommon behavior after a breakup. 

But if you want to actually maintain some friendship with her, communicate! Sit down with her, address her insecurities, tell her that she mattered immensely, that you still care about her, *but* then explain that everybody moves on from a breakup in a different way, that you have a right to date other people, and most importantly, tell her it's *not* ok to libel you with the ""cheater"" label. "
163,Return him to the womb from whence he came
164,"Super romantic! I saw someone else said this, but I agree - maybe don't have all of your props ready and lined up that you will lead her through - she will probably instantly know what's happening. Maybe do the petals and make it subtle leading up and then have the bedroom fully decked out so when she walks in, she sees it all at once and by the time she puts two and two together, you'll  be on one knee.

Honestly, the thought you're already putting into it is so sweet. This isn't boring at all! Good luck!"
165,"You're an adult with bodily autonomy. No is a complete sentence, shut down the conversation and make it clear that her opinion is unsolicited and unwanted. 

Grey rock her, then rock your gorgeous curls!"
166,"It is for you to decide if she is worth the trouble, it is a rational normal aspiration to want a good relationship with immediate relatives. that however assumes that they have a similar aspiration.

On that note, you should make contact contingent on ground rules. I think it would be best to put these ground rules in writing, and maybe explain your feelings / perspective which lead to that rule in the first place.

than make clear to her; that if she can't muster the civility and respect to follow these rules, 
(which you are embarrassed to have to spell out in the first place) she isn't worth the trouble, and she ought to go look for another doormat.

As i said, i recommend putting that in writing - first of all she won't be able interrupt you with self aggreavement / victim hood / hostility. 

second of all she won't have to respond immediately, which maybe allows her to cool down, and actually reflect on her behavior. 

Just let her know that you are only willing to put forward a good faith effort If you feel like she is willing to do the same. If she can't muster the respect and civility to follow the rules for her own daughter, regardless of whether or not she ""understands"" them, there might be a reason she's alone. 

"
167,"You've already said it would be over if it was a short kiss. It was more than a short kiss. 

Break up with her, so what if she didn't go wild in her teens? If she wants to make up for it, let her, just not when her ultimate responsibility is to you."
168,"&gt; you're speaking with the benefit of hindsight

Okay, but now you have the benefit of hindsight, too. You have all the information you need to realize that your friends care about you and that any weirdness on their part was an unfortunate side effect of them trying to do something special for you. 

If I was in your shoes, I would apologize for the misunderstanding, tell them about your history and why you were feeling insecure, and thank them for going to so much effort to honor your birthday. If you don't like surprise parties, you can let them know that. But unless they had reason to believe you wouldn't welcome a surprise party, it doesn't sound like they have anything to apologize for. 

If I was in their shoes, I would be hurt that you sent that text message and accused us of not being your friends, instead of having a conversation and giving us a chance to explain ourselves. But I would also be able and willing to move past it, especially if you apologized and helped me understand why you were feeling insecure."
169,"Only do it if you are willing to bet on your relationship, as such. If you break up you may never see that money again. Unless you draw it up as a legal contract - are you planning to do that? How would she feel about that?

I don’t think it’s a terrible idea, if you get it in writing that this is a loan and what rate she’s going to pay it back. Within your relationship you might be more flexible - but make sure you’re protected just in case. Otherwise it seems like a kind gesture - you’ve got the money now, she’s incurring interest right now, if you loan it to her it just saves her interest meaning she’ll have more to contribute to your lives."
170,I think you need to break up with your girlfriend as you are definitely not committed totally into the relationship and even though it isn't your girlfriends fault it is not fair to be with her if you are not totally committed into the relationship and are thinking of another girl. However you do also need to consider your friends relationship and if that is important to you and if you want to keep that relationship you should not pursue after the girl. But if the girl is very important to you and you feel like you want to pursue a relationship with her than go for it but understand that you will lose quite a lot in this situation

175,"OP, lock down your credit and get a credit check. Your mum has access to your personal info and may have opened accounts in your name. 

You may need to consider legal action to get your money back, but unless she's admitted it's a loan in writing it will be hard to prove. Consider it a loss, a price paid to learn a valuable less: Just because someone is ""family"" doesn't stop them from being an asshole."

177,"Let’s see how he responds. Sure if OP wants this work, talk. 

But, also, believe people the first time when they show you who they are.

My money is on - this guy makes a very, very half-hearted try at changing.

He’s showing his true nature right now, and it’s very ugly. 

There’s nothing stopping him right now from being thoughtful and considerate. But he’s not doing any of that.

Sure, talk to him but don’t hesitate to hit the eject button OP and seeing what life is like after this guy goes flying out of your life. "

I say this as someone who's been in your shoes:  *stop being so nice.* You should not be fretting over how to be polite like a good little girl.  Good little girls don't get respect, good little girls attract parasites because who else would put up with this crap? The goal is to be frank and honest, not rude or especially polite. 

You're making his life way too easy by not making a peep. Does he like you, or just the conveniences you provide? Find out. Many sad marriages are based on the premise of making one of the partner's life convenient without reciprocation or appreciation. If he cares for you, he will make sacrifices *for you.* "
183,"I think the point people are driving at is that while this guy is a mooch, you need to learn to speak up and assert yourself.  Even if you had a 50-50 guy, there's always bumps in the road in any relationship.

Preferably, before you get to the 'boiling over' point."

187,"&gt; However, her saying that she thinks I don’t love her really hurt the most 

I mean, even at 15, this is a very emotionally manipulative thing to say. 

I can guess how strongly you feel for her but HS relationships are supposed to be fun and mutually supportive, not emotional slogs. It really sounds like your GF is using you as an emotional crutch for her own insecurities.

If someone is taking up more time than you really have to give and does nothing for your future prospects, you really need to cut them loose and focus on what's important. You don't want to look back on your high school days thinking you lost out on friendships and experiences because you were focusing your time on a girl who says I love you to people who aren't her boyfriend."
188,"I read that laundry list of his failures to not only Adult but to Human, and I was worried you were going to ask if you should send him to jail or let him off the hook. (If that were the choice, JAIL.)

But your idea of the 6mos reprieve, no jail/fines and to do ""an intensive inpatient 30+ day treatment for depression and video game addiction"" plus get a job afterwards...is a GREAT IDEA. 
 
Why? It's a win-win for you. If he agrees, yes, maybe he changes, becomes healthier. The kids see him improve. And obviously rehab &gt; jail, plus the reprieve? Best deal for him for sure. 

If he doesn't agree (and WON'T), he goes to jail. Boom. He and his family can't deny you gave him a great alternative (I mean, they *will* deny it, but whatevs). The kids will know how much you tried to help their father (when IMO, you would be well within your rights to be waaay past magnanimity). And your ex is out of your hair for a while. And you can shrug and say, ""We gave him the choice."""
189,"Yes your parents are sexist. But there’s nothing you can say or do to change that. Nothing we say here is going to convince your folks to let your boyfriend come visit.

You're really glossing over this. And in your post, it's clear that you'd still like to have sex and take care of your sexual urges. Are you sure you're happy? I'm getting an undertone of ""it's fiiiine, it's fine! Really, it's *fine.*"" from this post."

Can we please stop acting like it is some mystical forbidden knowledge not to blatantly hog her food?

203,"He might just not realize the extent in which his actions hurt you, or understand the difference between a relationship and being a guest/friend. 

Honestly, if you don't want to talk to him about it, I recommend that you slowly break that habit. You could pretend you are going on a diet and have little food at home/eat before meeting him. Just to see what happens when he is hungry and wants food. When he eventually breaks and starts ordering in or buys food. You can try doing the same as he does to you, and see the reaction. Or just generally ask him sometimes if he can bring over some groceries on the way to meeting you. "

You have one option. 

Withdraw all money from the account and let it sit there empty. The bank will close it eventually. Go open an account somewhere else where she can’t touch it.

You're getting a lot of responses very quickly, and that can be totally overwhelming. So first, take a deep breath. And another. It's going to be okay."
207,"Then it may be on you to take the scary step of being honest and vulnerable. Lead with how you love the comfort and stability here, but be honest about how you feel. Maybe he feels the same way, maybe he doesn't. Any way you can move the marriage counselor stuff up, so you can more promptly address this in that setting?"
208,I used to lurk on that sub and it's just depressing honestly. I don't feel that way about him. He was worked up for T recently and it's not an issue. For him it's honestly stress. 
209,"I left a good teaching job in Korea for my current SO.  It's rough for sure at times, but what isn't? I am a high strung person and it can be hard for me to be ""happy"" but she has been worth it.  It won't always feel that way but when I sit down and imagine her out of my life, it gives me sadness.

212,"My thought too. It's hard to judge whether he's just being a clueless guy, or whether he's walking around thinking ""Oh, she can afford it."" The first is fixable, the latter is fighting words, IMHO.

You could try cutting him off and seeing how he reacts. Next time he tries to take leftovers, tell him that you want to save those for yourself. If he takes it in stride, that's promising. If he throws a temper tantrum, you know he's dating your fridge, not you. "
213,"Holy shit i've never seen such a pure example of narcissistic abuse. You should actually post this over in r/narcissisticabuse, i think a lot of people there would be able to help.

Honest advice, having been surrounded by narcs my whole life? Either cut the rope, get them out because their toxicity won't ever end, because the world and everything in it surrounds them.

Or (and i've had to do this too) : keep them at the edge of your life always. Never let them in. Never let their actions bother you because they know they have that control over you and it powers them. It literally feeds them. I've had to do this to very close family. Several members. I've stopped telling them about my life, my problems, my marriage, and kept my husband apart from them as they tried several times to interfere. 

As of right now their emotions and feelings have too much baring on you, which i totally get, they're your family, but you will need to learn to separate yourself emotionally from what they do and say if you want to keep them around. I learned this a very very difficult way and still struggle with it today. Like for example your mum messaging you in that manner, it's pure manipulation.

I wish I had some advice that would just fix this because the emotional strain is awful, but I wish you the best. Good luck."
214,"As long as both of you are happy with the situation, I don't see anything wrong with it. Hubby and I are similar: after 14 years, it's hard to hump like teenagers on a regular basis. But we enjoy each other's company, and make a good team. :-)"

217,"Then talk to him. Ask him if he would be open to trying it again. If there is anything he would want to try again. Some men lose interest and it has nothing to do with you, but it isn’t always a permanent thing. Don’t be disappointed if he says no, just accept it. He had the chance to be honest. It is hard to talk about and might be easier to bring up in therapy. I made an assumption that he just accepted your disinterest in sex, which is what happened in my marriage. Sorry."

220,It is about being polite and less assertive.
221,"Bro you need to leave her. I (20m) was in an abusive relationship for a year and a half with my ex (21f) the first 6 months were reasonably fine. But your story sounds very similar to mine, I had done a couple of things to piss her off over time but I genuinely put everything down for her and she was everything to me. She would treat me like shit a lot, get raging at me over something as little as saying aw we should move a bit so the family behind us can see (at a show we were at) and it would ruin the whole event (this happened whenever we'd go out). She would put down my friends make me feel as if they weren't looking out for me or that I couldn't trust them, I became completely isolated in the relationship nothing else was going on besides the stress in the relationship.

It got to the point where I was scared about us doing anything! Because she would get really horrible when she was angry like really out me down about myself and make me feel like a shirt boyfriend. It got the the pint where she was actually physically abusive, one time I actually had to run away from her in the middle of the street when she was attacking me. 
I think the main issue is that she would always apologise after stuff, I told her how the problems were affecting me that the arguing and all that was really fucking me up mentally and she'd promise she'd get better etc. But in reality it only got worse.
You really need to leave her man I don't want it to get as bad as it did for me and I see the exact same patterns in what's happening with you. It's fucking hard tho when you love someone, it's been almost 5 months and I still think of her sometimes but I'm so much better now. You can't live your life controlled by someone literally living in fear and worried to speak your mind about what's going on. No matter how she tries to manipulate the situation By bringing up your past mistakes she is the one with the issues! And the only way I can see for her to sort her issues is for you to leave her and hopefully in the future she can grow as a person and understand what she was doing and not be like that to someone else. 
Hope I was some help

222,"&gt; So having a British passport would change nothing for me

Yes it would. Easy travelling, easy access to 164 different countries."
223,"Thankfully, you don't have to settle with him!"
224,No. And the great thing about an ex is that they can feel however they want and you don't have to care
225,You deserve a partner who has the self awareness not to treat anyone like this. A normal person would have gotten this experience in their friendships. I married someone with no previous relationship experience who is also selfish and inconsiderate and continually blames his lack of experience. It honestly doesn’t get better.
226,"When something similar happened to me, it just turned out my parents were hardcore swingers. Now I can never un-hear it. Who knows what they’ve agreed to or maybe not. You can ask him, but I wouldn’t be accusatory, just state what you saw and you want to know if your family is safe?"
227,Such is life. He was my very first boyfriend and I don't know any better. Only thing that really sucked was I was then single at 25 with only one crap relationship under my belt 😂😂
228,It took me about 6 months and ~50 first dates to find someone I was happy with and who was happy with me.
229,I guess it's possible but she sounds like she's not right in the head.
230,"Wow so this is a crazy jumble of emotions. I guess the most important thing that I didn't see addressed here is; do you want a relationship with her? You say you're in love with her and stuff, but you don't ever mention if you want to try making a relationship work with her? 

If the answer to that is a yes, then there's a followup question. Have you told her how you feel about her? It seems like you've been friends for a while and have even hooked up, but have you told her how you honestly feel and that you'd like to be in a relationship?

All this being said, it's clear that you're a bit confused and could benefit by just taking a step back and doing a bit of self reflection. Figuring what's important to you. Whether that's getting a job and moving to the states or trying to build a relationship with this girl. You're a hot mess of emotions right now, and I say this in the kindest way possible, but you need to get your shit together and figure out what you want."
231,"She COULD be a bit freaked that you bought something more expensive than she was expecting and now she is wondering if you expect her to reciprocate and she can't afford it, or if you are now in a different level of relationship and she's not sure what that means, something like that. "
232,"It sounds to me like she won’t like the kitchen pressure period. Prep or head chef, cooking in a restaurant kitchen will always be fast-paced and physical. 

I wonder if she needs to look at alternatives like being a personal chef, or work for a catering company, or even have a specialization like pastry artistry. 

But this is what she chose and while she’s entitled to be overwhelmed and sad some days, she also has to realize that when you have made sacrifices, when you possess the job that pays for your lives with visas depending on that....there is a degree of insult here. Because this is paying her dues. She understood this. You are working hard too. So while she needs to express herself honestly, she doesn’t get to express these feelings with tactless abandon. She has to place some coping skills in place. Something to look forward to; no talk of work 30 min after coming home; whatever. "
233,"Take it for what it is- a friendly set of texts. Reading in to them will cause you hurt. If he wants you, he will let you know, then you can decide what to do."
234,Sorry my dad didn’t let me do me homework
235,"I've been off-and-on NC with my mom for the last 5 years or so.  Most recently, we're been NC for the last 4 months or so.

It started when she overstepped boundaries (her main problem) and made everything about herself and I couldn't stand it anymore.  I have let her back in a total of three times, and each time it started out okay.  Very light, nothing serious, just a baseline relationship with my mother.

Then she would get comfortable enough to stop controlling her emotions and actions, and I'd cut her off entirely.

Like I said, this happened three times and at this point, she's approaching 60 years old and I don't think she has it in her to change.  I'm not going to be letting her back in again.  

I'm not saying your mom won't change or realize her mistakes/faults, but that was my experience.  I wish I had just kept NC from the very first time I cut off contact.  It was an emotional burden and a waste of time every chance I gave her.  "
236,That is a great idea and then I can watch our dog and she won't need a puppy sitter!
237,"Get back together until you get your money back, then break up with her.  Ignore all those ""miss her"" feelings until they go away, live a better life without someone that steals. "
238,"&gt; ive realized after moving in with him that my boyfriend is emotionally/mentally abusive so not only do I avoid his family because of the mentioned issues but I no longer feel the need to maintain a relationship with them because I’ve been in the process of considering leaving him 

You dont need advice on avoiding his family for the rest of your life, you need to work up the strength and courage to leave your boyfriend and cut everyone out. Go to therapy if you need help doing this, they can be a great resource if you arent feeling strong enough to go through with it.

245,"Thanks for your kind words. Since I found out he has been talking to his ex again I have made somewhat of a plan. I want to move out and get away, but money is an issue since we’re basically both financially dependent upon each other and I’m also not sure when the right time would be. We have until May 1st before our lease is up. But I guess the sooner the better. I am also scared to tell him"
246,"Catching him with empty beer cans in the garage was a fairly common occurrence when he ""quit"" drinking. I haven't caught him doing this in awhile but who knows, maybe he's gotten better at hiding.  "
247,"Those are my biggest questions. Supposedly it shouldn't take that long to move out of being a Prep cook, everyone at her current restaurant got promoted after 2-4 months so even if the work is hard it's not like she's looking at a lifetime of being miserable you know? 

I think as a 27YO you should be able to endure a few months of hard work to pursue your dream, it's not really a big ask and most people I know had to go through a period of similar hardship (hell, I was an intern for almost 2 years working 12h/day to finally land my dream job). 

Obviously every person faces difficult situations differently but I don't feel like asking her to ""suck it up and go through with it without complaining every day"" (I would never say this to her BTW) for a few months is unreasonable.

Will look into the personal chef/catering option, thanks for the suggestion. Being an instagram Chef is definitely on top of her wish list but as you might expect these things take time to bring any income."

250,"Ok....so did he agree to not change the trip?  Or did you agree to change it?

He legitimately forgot and probably assumed you wouldn't want to go because you don't know the guy, which is not unreasonable.  If you want to be invited, just ask.

In short, yes, you're very much over-reacting to assume this means he doesn't care about you or respect you, or that this means he will be a terrible life partner.

Are you usually this anxious and think about catastrophic consequences of normal occurrences?"
251,"If you think of it logically, you will see thats its already over. Do you really want to be with someone who on a mere suspicion decides you are guilty and then also arbitrarily ""punishes you""? 

To me this seems like an indication of how she resolves any trust issues. These kind of actions usually escalate. If you take her back now, you have implicitly accepted that this is her way of expressing anger.

Do you realise how much more damage could be done if you ever have any dependants? If you had a pet would she have harmed it to punish you for any supposed cheating(or any other presumed offence) in future? Would she harm you if your ""crime""was grave enough?

Also every time such a she accuses you of something, would you have to totally break down and plead innocence before she believes you? Are you prepared to do that?

The way I see it the you should be way more scared of actually being with such a person.

Would it not be better to find someone who resolves issues with calm discussions and not criminal behaviour?

Forget the money, learn the lesson. You got off cheap. "

253,"For the most part I would say not a red flag. Personally I still find shit from my ex’s 5+ years ago that o just completely forgot I still had. Maybe just boxing up all that stuff was a way to help her move on. If she’s still clinging to it or actively going through it that’s one thing, but if it’s just in storage that another story. "

This is not a behavior that you can ask someone to change and they can easily change (""Honey, could you trim your toesnails in the bathroom not in the dining room?"" )

This is her perception of life - that honesty is not that important compared to convenience.  You can waste your time asking her to change this - and the most that will happen is that she will learn to not lie when you are around.  

Of course she's lying to you.  It's who she is.

265,He does understand. He just doesn't care.
266,"Well, it sounds VERY similar to what I went through 28 years ago with a boyfriend and his cousin. I mention tjr length of time because I found it so disturbing that even now, 28 years later, I remember specific episodes of the exact behavior you describe
 My ex and his female 1st cousin grew up close and as young adults,, moved in to their first apartment together. We lived in a fairly large east coast city where rents were high, so most 20-somethings would definitely need a roommate if they wanted to live in the city, not the 'burbs.

The cousin acted exactly like you describe and she was openly hostile to me. It got to the point where I wouldn't even go to his place if she was home because it was all so uncomfortable.  I ended up breaking up with him for several reasons, and I remember feeling relief I wouldn't have to deal with their weird dynamic anymore.

About 2 months after we broke up, I was on a first date with a guy and we were in line to see a movie.... I looked ahead in the line and there was my ex KISSING and holding hands with his cousin.

My advice is.. Go with your gut.. If something seems off it probably is. Talk to your boyfriend.. He needs to create boundaries. If he doesn't want to, well, then that is a different conversation "

You should definitely approach him about it. This is all stuff that he definitely has no idea are bothering you. Except the not being serious enough. Anyway, just have a casual conversation about how you’d really appreciate it if he did x, y, z. If he’s a mature guy he won’t take it as criticism, but as change and compromise to build a better relationship. "
279,"&gt;Something in me wants to give her another chance. 

It's naivete. 

All respect when I say this, but it sounds like you haven't had a lot of relationship experience.

These early relationships are key to learning about how you want to be treated and how poorly you're willing to be treated.

Right now you're willing to be walked all over instead of being independent, seeking out your own self-confidence and self-worth, and determining it for yourself, instead of letting someone else decide for you what your value is.

The more you date, the more people you meet, and the more goodbyes you have, the more you see people change over time, the more people disperse, the easier it gets. You realize that not everyone is there to be with you for the rest of your life. Some people are just there to help you figure out what's supposed to come next. What you deserve. And what you don't.

They say everyone comes for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. She does not sound like your lifetime girl. If she was, things wouldn't feel so bad and shitty. Re-block her, cut the ties, and start getting out there more. You deserve better, and you know it."
280,"Nothing you want is unreasonable. Sit down and have a chat with him - if the relationship is as healthy as you say it is, he should be open to hearing what you have to say and the two of you should be able to compromise on something like date night and possibly a mutual hobby."
281,"Some people end up being friends with people they met on a dating app, but if you are *only* looking for friends, you don't go on a dating app, you go to Meetup or whatever"
282,"I agree. OP's father was correct in teaching her generally to be respected by her male partner, however not every parent drills these concepts into their kids. Maybe her boyfriend's parents didn't emphasize chivalry, but being honest and positive instead. I would recommend having a sit down with him as well, and just letting him know exactly how she feels. These problems are pretty minor and if he's amazing and supportive then he will respect and compromise with her requests."
283,"Can I ask what ‘good conditions’ means - even if you have to vague in some manner. It’s hard to wrap my head around why you cant stay somewhere else but can/will once you can assure yourself of the conditions 

Example - Like rent a hotel room by yourself - that’s like 100 bucks and it’s climate controlled and you can lock the door and it’s all to yourself "
284,No one is saying that the bf only needs OP. The issue is that one of the bf's friends wants to kick OP out of her own house. This would be just as rude if OP was just a roommate or family member. Nice goal post shift though.

287,That's not normal. At best it's a childish tantrum from someone who refuses to even attempt to control themself but most likely it is a red flag and one day he'll be able to rationalize away hitting something besides the wall. 
288,"After talking with a few other people too, I think this is the route I'm going. "
289,"My good friend became a private chef, and I ended up being his reference for his first job. He was living in my basement while he figured stuff out, and he ended up cooking most of the time to help out. When the time came for a reference, I could talk about dozens of different kinds of meals he had made and how he was able to cook different meals for different people (he wasn't a professional chef when he started - cooking started off as a hobby and became a more and more engrossing one for him). He was basically my live-in chef for a year.  So the first reference to get a job doesn't need to be the most professional - it just needs to be someone who has really experienced the breadth of her cooking. "
290,"Not to sound harsh here but you need to decide what you want to do, living wise. If you want to have YOUR apartment where your gf lives with you, then you can continue to pay rent on your own. If, however, you want it to be living equally together you need to sit down with your SO and discuss splitting bills more evenly.

What she's asking for isn't unreasonable. She is assuming that you are equals in living together. Your friends can visit and stay and so can hers. She should have mentioned it to you first but in her head she's not done anything wrong. You're kind of sounding like you're having your cake and eating it a bit here otherwise. You either need to explain to your gf that because you pay rent and it is your name on the lease, you feel like it is your place, or you need to discuss alternative bill paying in the future.

Also, I don't feel like gf's friend is being unreasonable in paying half a month's rent. Unless you mean she's paying only half of her own 'share' of the bill. I currently split the rent 50/50 with my SO, so if someone was to temporarily move in with us for a month and a half, I'd only be expecting them to pay their share of a month and a half, which is a third. "
291,What do you really want from her? Are you okay with this back-and-forth situation to continue for a few years?
292,"That's straight out of Abuser 101. They want you dependent, isolated and reliant solely on them. Then they own you and can do whatever they like to you."
293,Very true. I talked to him again and made it clear that that's just the technical definition for it. I explained to him that it had nothing to do with sexual contact but rather her crossing boundaries. I made it clear also that I was not accusing him of being at fault for anyting and he has agreed to talk to her and tell her to step off. But thank you.
294,"I used to in my very early 20's. I had anger management issues and everything set me off. Shortly after moving in with my girlfriend I put my fist through a wall. My girlfriend told me in no uncertain terms my options were getting my shit together and finding a better outlet or not only would I be single, she'd call the cops if I damaged property again. It was a reality check for me, and not only did I stop for my own good, I stopped because I loved her too much to make her endure that. That was about 9 years ago.

If your husband values you and your comfort, he'd look for alternatives. It can be very hard to get out of the habit, and that instant ""release"" from smashing something can be cathartic, but it isn't sustainable and isn't fair to those around him. A punching bag is a great idea, or the old school hitting of a pillow, a stress ball, etc. That way he still gets the physical release, but there's no damage to property and it's handled in a mature way that doesn't intimidate you with his aggressiveness."
295,"Oh no I definitely didn't mean it offensively. The reason I put it that way was because that's how he worded it in our conversation. I asked him if he was looking at the situation clearly and could he possibly give me what I needed to be happy and he admitted that he might be thinking naively and wanting to ""have his cake and eat it too"""
296,Passion is the most important factor of a relationship. Communication is second.

Doesn't mean he doesn't feel that way or see the potential in that, but he may have learned to be more cautious. None of this is an insult to you.

I'm a gay guy in SF, so a lot of my friends are people I've slept with once and then just ended up really close, or folks I've gone on one date with but ended up clicking better as friends, or dudes I've never really been attracted to, never will be, and yet love deeply. I know it's not exactly the same, but... "
306,5 months isnt that long.....
307,"First, your confidence and self esteem are in the gutter for some reason. Sure, most people aren't some platonic ideal of a man, but you're selling yourself short if you think that aren't women who find you attractive. And to solve this, you have to learn how to love yourself, flaws and all, and that's something that needs to happen independent of this one hot girl who apparently finds you attractive (trying to meet up with her won't solve it either, even if you two end up together in some fashion).

Second, I'm sort of confused about the details of her visiting your country. Is she coming for a holiday or something? Are you now in contact with her? I would ask your friend for her number or ask your friend to give her yours, or create a damn insta and friend her there, and just start fresh. Maybe text/message ""Hey, not sure if you remember me, but I'm &lt;your name, &lt;your friend's&gt; friend from &lt;country&gt;. She mentioned that you're coming to &lt;country&gt; and I was wondering if you'd like to meet up for a drink or something. I know of this place with great watermelon drinks. ;) Let me know."""
308,Thank you so much. I really hope it will all work out. This was truly helpful in opening my eyes to some things. 
309,"Me and my ex broke up because of this. I found myself not being attracted to him anymore and as good as the relationship was outside of the bedroom, I just couldn't get sexually aroused anymore. I think it's more common than people think, but if you're not married or committed for life, I think it's best to just cut ties and move on. Or at least that's what we decided to do. I can say that that was one of the hardest conversations/breakups I've ever had to go through because he wasn't expecting it AT ALL, and I was holding it in for a couple months. I think sex is very important in a relationship (some people don't) so I put it above a lot of other qualities that others probably wouldn't. I'm too young to settle (32) for anything less that what I feel I need in a relationship, even if everything else is perfect.   

You could also try therapy to see if you can get that attraction back. I read some articles prior to breaking it off and I read that it can help. Maybe a sexual therapist? I asked my ex if we could do that prior to just ending it, but he decided to just go our separate ways and I was ok with that.   

Best wishes, OP. I've been there and it's not easy, but you gotta do what is best for you, and you're still so young! "

I think all you can really do now is see how your crush acts around just you, because more data is needed or move on. Take your pick."
313,"It sounds like you already know what the right decision for yourself is. It will be sad and hard. When a parent makes the relationship with their child one of conditional love, it always is. Therapy is a good idea to help move past this. I don't know how your mother will react, but it's safe to say you should prepare for the worst. I want to caution you that you probably won't get very far trying to convince her of anything. The most important thing is to take care of yourself. No functioning parent would ask you to do otherwise just to fulfill their goals and desires (not even getting into the validity of those goals and desires)."
314,"I'm speaking from personal experience- my husband is working on his anger issues. Hes acknowledged that they exist, but before he did, he did a lot of what your guy is doing. 

On the other end of things, my guy was much younger than yours is... that being said, this is entirely up to you.

If you don't feel safe, you should leave. He has some growing up to do, and it may go positive, but he could also escalate the violence.

Therapy may help. I was in your shoes, I waited it out, and things did improve. Then again, I don't like how he's locked you out and slammed the breaks on the highway. 

Again, if you feel even a little unsafe, it's time to go. You should feel secure with who you're dating, not worried about getting hurt."
315,"You are focusing on the wrong thing (the kind of guys you think she wants). What do you want here?  If you want to pursue a relationship whether short or long term go for it. Dont let your insecurities get the better of you. Lastly, whatever your experience is or isn't, people are generally attracted to confident and humble. "
316,"It sounds like he really likes you and wants to respect the boundaries you set. ""Taking it slow"" CAN apply just to the physical aspect of the relationship, and I think that's what he's wanting to do. I think you should see him again, I'm not really sure what about this makes him not attractive to you."
317,"And every time those words leave his mouth, your mother is probably looking down and flipping double middle fingers at him. "
318,"I know you didn't mean it this way and that you're trying to help, but this comment was very hurtful. I genuinely try to do my best in the relationship, and that's why I already do see a therapist. I just want you to know that we have a very happy and healthy relationship the vast majority of the time and love each other very much."
319,"Sounds like the landlord knows exactly who sarah is. Which is good as they will back you. Which I suspect you may need because she clearly wants to be with her sister and is the kind of person to make you so uncomfortable that you think about leaving. Don’t. Just stop communicating for now with her (you’re trying to please somebody you owe nothing to, I know it feels polite to try to accommodate her nonsense but she’s going to take advantage). And be prepared for her to be annoying or have friends or parties or whatever. You report this every time, I’m sure she’ll be violating her lease and sounds like landlord is willing to deal w her"
320,"I don't know the ins and outs of your (ex) relationship, but if I may ask, why was it a seemingly commit or leave circumstance for you? 

Why weren't you able to say something such as: ""I can't promise you forever, because I don't know what my or our future(s) hold, but I enjoy our relationship in the present so let's focus on that""?

Also, yes, at your age it's a HORRIBLE idea to get engaged or married. Horrible idea. But I am not understanding why you had to break up with her.

Did she give you an ultimatum? An example would be ""propose or we're over"" or ""if you can't tell me whether you'll marry me for certain I'm leaving you"".
Your ex saying something along the lines of these examples would make you leaving her make more sense to me but other than that I don't see why there wasn't or couldn't be a middle ground for you.

I'm sorry; breakups and/or heartbreak, whether you're the one broken up with or you're the one ending things, are so shitty. Things also don't have to always end for good. You two may just not be working out for now but the future might be different❤️"
321,You don't like her as a partner anymore so you break up with her and find someone more compatible. 
322,"Yes - take it from a guy with HIV lol. If you’re sexually active, just get tested every 3 months. It’s easy and doesn’t hurt anything. Also, if you’re gay get on prep. If I had gotten on it sooner I wouldn’t have to deal w what I deal with. It’s not as big a deal these days - I take a pill and whatever. Undetectable actually means I’m fine and can’t infect anyone ( of course I always disclose). Tht said, with prep out there is no reason I shouldn’t be a member of the last generation of proudly slutty gays to ever get infected. "
323,"Someone doesn’t need to be physically abusive in order to be abusive. My ex never hit me or beat me. He grabbed me by the throat once, pushed me, threw shit at me... but because he didn’t hit me, he had me fooled that he wasn’t abusive. When in reality he was in all aspects... physical, emotional, sexual. Look up the power and control wheel, it’s very eye opening. 


Surround yourself with people who care about you, you’ll be ok. 💕"
324,Marriage is complicated and your wife sounds like she is a bit complicated.  If can afford to do it... then I'd say go to her and make one last ditch effort. Don't grovel but let her know that she is your everything and your not ready to give up. 
325,"Because she doesn’t know what she wants, you being friendly and satisfying her emotional needs and sometimes sexual let’s her be in two relationships at once and allows her to be indecisive with no consequences. She obviously thinks it okay to flip flop between relationships. If shes not 100% satisfied with your relationship you will be waisting your time as she will always be doing this. She does find some good qualities in this other guy whether she tells you or not. Time to move on and leave her with that poor guy, cause the same thing will happen to him. "
326,"Well shit....your story sounds just like mine!

When I decided to cut my mother out of my life (after years of chances and warnings), it was the BEST thing! I too, felt so much lighter, like a planet I had been carrying was lifted from my shoulders. 

The one thing you're doing wrong though, is listening to her voice messages and reading her emails. Stop that shit! Block her on emails and just delete voice messages without listening. She's doing it to guilt trip you to letting her back in. It's a deliberate ploy.

Look, I've been there, really, I have, like you wouldn't believe. If your mother has no friends, then that's her issue, not yours. You are not responsible for this grown-arse woman. She gave you a horrible childhood that has continued to affect you way into adulthood....something that she will probably never acknowledge. I know. It affected my life too.

Please, for your own mental health and well-being, go COMPLETELY no contact for a good year and see how it feels. I think you'll like it and won't want to go back. You know she will never, ever change. Don't do it to yourself. She created this, not you. You gave her chances. She abused them. No reason to feel guilty, ok?

Last thing - go over to r/raisedbynarcissists and have a read of everyone's stories. It really helped me understand how my mother's massively abusive behavioir has affected me into adulthood, and how it even affected my relationship choices.  It took me a VERY long time to understand what happened and to make a change in myself, but when I did,it was SO much better! 
They're a good bunch over there, and I found them massively supportive. This is what you need right now, as well as an understanding of her behaviours. If you're aware of the behaviour that these sort of people pull, then it's easier to be immune to it, as you can see it coming,and see it for what it is - manipulation.

Good luck and strength in this. Seriously don't let her back in, at all. It's not worth it. I haven't regretted my decision a single day! I think you will be likewise.  :)"
327,Next time Sam gets drunk maybe someone should record him
328,"Keep a record of your group chat. If they don't pull their weight, speak to the instructor again and show her your attempts to get it organised. If she still says no, it's a group effort then you'll either have to live with it or make a complaint about the way the instructor is running this project. Having been the one in a group that does all the running around, I know how insanely unfair and frustrating this feels. Your instructor should be pushing you to work together, but at the point where it really isn't working, they need to accept that these individuals should take responsibility for their lack of motivation. "
329,"First thing, thank you for the kind words miss, and sorry if I misspell something, I am Brazilian. So, we already breaked up 4 times, sometimes because of her being rude to me because of the culmination of problems with her family's and some bad attitudes of myself (nothing serious), the most recent of our breakups taking this one, was for the same reason, but after 6 months she reached out to me, and we start to date again, I thought that this time it would be different... so at this time, and I talked to her i was having the same doubts about being engaged together, she said she didn't deserve to pass this type of thing again( and I agree with her, it is definitely being hard for me, imagine for her). And them I said I sadly couldn't change my mind, I would just postpone the problem. She said too that she was certain about what she wanted and deserved someone that was too. Again, I agreed with her, so she breakup. "

332,He sounds like he's full of shit
333,Very true; if the actions don't back them up the words don't mean much!
334,"How do I do that though, won’t I just look cold if I hit her with that after 2 years, it’s shit cause I seem to care more about her feelings than mine "
335,This whole post reeks of trashiness. Where do kids learn this sort of behavior?
336,"Don't feel bad, some gifts just fall flat sometimes. Offer to take her to return it maybe, not just tell her she can return it, but this will happen every now and then. There is a reason gift receipts exit. You made a great effort with the information you had, and perhaps the bracelet idea was exiting for  at the time, and that idea faded later. When I shop, often I will see many nice things, and then go back into my basket or cart and realize I don't really like or need some of it, even when I'm shopping with a gift card."
337,"So happy to have helped you!❤️ 

I'm sure you'll get some more wonderful perspectives on here that'll help too; I'm always glad to hear I positively impacted someone no matter how small!☺️"
338,Your boyfriend should get a job first or you might regret taking on the financial burden.
339,"I think you need to push a little. If you honestly just want him to say the words, it is such a small thing and a reasonable person would be happy to do it, even if they don't fully understand why it matters to you.

It's a good skill to have in general, to advocate for something you really want."
340,"You're welcome. Hopefully he can see that setting your relationship on fire to keep her warm displays an alarming lack of priorities. And if not, well, you're better off with someone who neither inserts themselves nor allows themselves to be caught up in other people's drama."
341,"I don’t think it’s weird to be disappointed, but it *may* be an early sign you're not compatible. If these gestures matter to you, this probably isn't the only one.  It's possible you also care about a thoughtful Valentine's Day gift/card, a nice anniversary celebration, or a really romantic proposal.  And maybe he doesn't see those gestures as meaningful or important and doesn't want to meet your needs/wants in that regard.  If he's not willing to do it now, is he willing to do it then?  Maybe he is, maybe he's still just not understanding the significance in this specific case, but will do it other times.  In which case it's just a matter of being super clear on why this matters. Or it's possible he just feels it's too soon, in which case a chat about what not too soon looks like could be useful. 

You can want things just because you want them, it doesn't have to be rational. If it's something that's meaningful to you, and he sees himself with you, it shouldn't be a big deal.  Don't try to change what you want or need for the sake of one person who can't be bothered.  It's not that hard to plan a nice date night to ask you to go steady. 

If you really can let it go and not feel crappy about it, then do that.  

If you can't, I'd try to be crystal clear with why it matters and if he really can't be bothered maybe it's worthwhile to find someone who can. "
342,"I'm sure you know this already, but if it helps to hear it from a stranger: stop having sex with him. Stop seeing him altogether. Stop any thoughts of getting back together in their tracks (easier said than done, but you have got to try.) Instead, find someone to talk to. Preferably a therapist, at least a supportive friend. No matter how long you were together and how good the relationship may have been in the past, you deserve much better than the way he's treating you now, even I can see that. You will get over him, once you give yourself permission, and support, to do so. Good luck to you. "
343,"He should be. He's taking advantage of young girls when he should be helping them solidify confidence in themselves.  I know you're too young to fully comprehend this, it would take another 10 -15 years for the seriousness of what he's doing to your friend to really sink in. This is not a good man.

356,"No, you aren’t not in the wrong!!! That is a totally crazy reaction that he had there. He sounds like a self sabotaging person with a lot of hate towards himself. Not your problem. I think that this might be an end point. Especially by having a daughter together, these kinds of things shouldn’t be going on. It’s like he’s got one foot out the door but is afraid to be the one to end it. How can you ruin his day by asking him this? If I asked my husband why did you take me off your Facebook, he’d be totally confused because he’d never have done that. If it happened he’d say that’s weird, and add me back. And it would be totally weird because that doesn’t just magically happen on its own. 
I do think he may want out but is too weak to be the one to do it. "
357,"The way I meant ""asked out"" would be for him to straight up ask me to be his girlfriend. It's too late now for that, considering he calls me his girlfriend already. I was just really hoping he would ask me "

360,"Since he's her employee, you would be doing her a favor by telling her how he's acting. His behavior is really unprofessional and definitely has the risk of driving other potential students away."
361,"You are 18. Start taking responsibility for yourself in more than one way

First, your immideate dilemma - the trips. If you are adamant you don’t want to go in any way shape or form you will need to sit your parents down and explain that you are not going. Reaffirm that you want to spend time with them and your family and you wish the best to your step brother but due to your anxiety from a past experience you are just not comfortable attending these trips. Be prepared for them to be upset but you will have to hold your ground if you are sure. Something like this ‘I am grateful that you have planned and paid for these 2 trips but I know myself and I am just not comfortable with the accommodations and sleeping situation. I have been dealing with this issue for a few years now and I know myself and I just can’t this time. I don’t want there to be hard feelings but I am not going to be attending either trip’

Now, the second issue. Again you are an adult. You need to find a more realistic and long term plan to cope with these feelings of anxiety. You can’t stay in your childhood home (or grandparents house) for the rest of your life. This will severely limit you in so many ways. Seek counselling, try exposure therapy, make inroads into healing in some way - you’ll never get over it otherwise

Finally, life is uncomfortable. You can’t always control your surroundings and have things the way you like. You will need to find a way to do this and sometimes that means being anxious and uncomfortable and maybe even unhappy for a short while. You can’t shelter yourself from all life’s pain. 

I wish you the best of luck"
362,"Hey, just for when you get back and settled someday, it is possible to maybe save this relationship if you want to.  (It’s also totally okay if it’s NOT salvageable or you want to be free!)  But I had really overbearing parents and a few years of independence, therapy, and boundary enforcing really gave me a new, different, and good relationship with my parents.  That said, you will have to put your boundaries up sometime and this is your time to do that.  Does your university offer counseling or therapy services?  I really, really needed a therapist to help me when I decided to do this and I can’t recommend it enough.  Good luck and don’t feel bad about this - you are doing the right thing for yourself AND your parents.  "

365,"I didn't mention divorce. You did. The question I did ask was because as described it doesn't sound like much of a relationship. This isn't a ""He's struggling with depression but otherwise we get along great"" post, this is a ""He doesn't respect my boundaries, has a porn addiction, and the counseling isn't making it better"" post. This is absolutely when the cost vs benefit analysis gets to be really important. It's fine if you want out, but don't project that feeling onto my question about what's good. You still haven't answered that by the way. "

367,"Sure doesn't. But my guess is that OP isn't telling us everything. They are passed the six month period. He just helped her move and the box may or may not explain the change in tempo Im guessing he is experiencing. I bet five internet bucks he updates in two weeks that they are taking a break. Less than a week after that it'll be ""well... my gf and I broke up."" All just guesses. No ill intent. He didn't come here just to tell us about a box. There's more to it.

Trust works both ways. If he leaves any questions for you, he's doing it wrong. He should be open and clear about what he's doing. If he has nothing to hide, he has nothing to hide. And in return you will indeed have to trust him. But if he's vague or evasive, he's not being fair towards you. "

372,"I appreciate the advice a lot, thank you."
373,Our parents and grandparents pretty well all sucked at relationships so we didn't really have the greatest examples.

Out of our 75 person guest list, 53 of them are family members. The other 22 either my fiancé or I have known since we were in single digits or we lived with in college and have remained friends with. If you think we shouldn’t be friends anymore because I don’t really want some random dude there who nobody has ever met...Then I guess we can’t be friends. 

Your response made me really glad for the friends that I do have because absolutely none of them reacted like you :) "
391,"Hi. I’m OP’s girlfriend. Found his post. He’s very embarrassed, but we’re all good now. Thanks y’all. Appreciate you helping him out. 👍🏻 "
392," A good loving relationship makes you feel safe. It lifts you up and makes you a stronger more confident and happier person. 

This man has destroyed your self esteem, he has made you dependent, isolated and anxious and crazy. 

He constantly accuses you of cheating.
He uses your dead mother against you.
He holds weapons to his throat and threatened suicide in minor disagreements.
He tells you nobody will love you and there is something wrong with you.
He doesn't care about your panick attacks.
He keeps you dependent on him and uses his financial control as a weapon against you.
He threatens to leave you and your daughter homeless.
He blames you for everything.

Tell me, does this sound like a loving relationship? Does a person like this sound like a good partner or caring father? 

You are in an emotionally abusive relationship love. He might not hit you. But he has done violent damage to your self esteem and mental health. He wants you to believe there is nothing better out there for you. But there is. You have a family who can help you and probably want to. You can get a job, go to school, raise your child and find someone who lifts you up and cares for you.

 He has whittled you down to the point where you don't think it is possible but I promise that it is. There is so so much better out there for you. 

If you do leave, he will switch tactics. The tears will start. The guilt, the promises of change. The 'we need to be a family for baby.' Do not fall for it. He has proven what he is, he will not change.If you stay strong then I imagine the anger, the threats of sucide, the abuse of the custody system.  Leaving is a dangerous time, even in relationships with no physical violence. Call family of a women's shelter and make a safe exit plan.

I know it seems like a big scary step, but run back into the arms of family and rebuilt yourself. You are worthy of real love and so is your child. "
393,"Do it now that you’ve thought about it more than once. Or... do it later when even more of your lives are intertwined and it’s more difficult because it’s been 4, 10, or even 30 years. "
394,"Very confused, if he already calls you his girlfriend, what does it mean to be ""asked out""?

Are you saying that you aren't exclusive yet?

I'm seeing a really great guy now who was really eager to move things forward because he was very into me. In the past, I've only ever seen hesitation to put ""labels"" on a relationship because one of us wasn't that into the other person, but didn't necessarily want to stop dating. Up to you if that matters or not. If it's really important (and that's totally fine if it is -- I couldn't handle my relationship being in limbo with someone I really liked), then you're justified in pushing it more and breaking up if he keeps avoiding it."
395,"If he has to worry that every time you get mad, you'll leave him, the relationship has no future.

Likewise, as long as you think that that is a mature, reasonable reaction when you're upset, this relationship has no future.

You can't make a whole when the both halves are damaged."
396,[removed]
397,"I know this sounds overly-complicated, but what I'm saying is that I currently live in the same house as my mother and am totally financially dependent on her. If she finds out I went against her wishes, I will have issues. 

So what I'm asking is, how do I navigate the relationship with my mother is regards to filing this report? It will break down trust if I report it behind her back or refuse to acknowledge her requests.

We are moving out in a couple weeks. Perhaps I strike a compromise with her that I will report it when we leave? "
398,"We all want more than we can afford. If you need out, look for a single room you can rent on your own for cheap while your boyfriend gets on govt assistance, since renting as a couple is extremely limiting. Otherwise, you're stuck here until you can afford something better. Keep browsing Craigslist for rooms you can afford that will accept couples; 99% of other roommate situations will not involve having dogshit laying around the house.

Also, why is this up to you? Your boyfriend is twenty six, he should have more experience with this, and he has more free time to look at places. Why isn't he taking the lead on this?"
399,"Please find a women's shelter right now. I'm so concerned for you, this isn't an ok environment for you or for your child to grow up in. "
400,"Honestly that's quite a bit of time.  I'd look for another place, and if you find one THEN ask the sister to pay you back the rent/deposit &amp; ask the landlord to assign your lease to her.  
    
This is something you can all agree to do.  No one is ""locked in"" if everyone is amenable to changing the agreement.  "
401,As you describe it; she is more of a face to face talker rather than a texter. Next time you talk to her ask her out for coffee. Worst she can do is say no then you have your answer.
402,"Woah this suddenly takes it to a totally different level. If he’s willing to snatch up scissors to hurt himself, it’s easy to just reverse his grip and turn that weapon on you."
403,Tell her to pay back the money first. Then ghost her.
404,"You're an adult, you can move out, and you're at a perfectly normal age for that. If she allows that to damage your relationship, that's on her. You can't reason with unreasonable people, and she's being really unreasonable and irresponsible right now. If your uncle's house works for your school commute, that sounds like a good idea in terms of saving money.

I'm more concerned with her leaving two minors (your brothers) without adequate food on a regular basis. That's neglect and honestly they shouldn't be living with her either."
405,[removed]
406,"Let me put it this way, I'm a bisexual woman. If I wasn't allowed to be friends with a gender I'm attracted to, I have no friends."
407,"Hey I didn't see your comment till today! 

Thanks for replying and I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. "
408,...*Girl.* 
409,"I would love to have a serious relationship with her, but not sure if money would have changed her. She's always been a pretty down to Earth person and besides her ex, the only other person she has ever liked is myself. But that could have changed or maybe she would think I am not good enough for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really bad and guilty over what I did and would at least like to apologize. I was really selfish and it was wrong of me, but I didn't want Suzie to know about Erina, either. Our friends would have roasted me. I lost them all anyways when Suzie split with me, so suppose in the end that never really mattered."
410,"i (28M) always delete nudes after a break-up. its part of moving on, but thats just my opinion."
411,"He said that prior to this year and focusing on debt, they split all bills 50-50"
412,"He has a few good long term friendships but he hasn't really spent time on them at all in the last year. As for family... he was adopted and his family isn't close at all. He speaks to his parents a few times a year on the phone.

He is however, close to and extremely invested in my family."
413,"The only way to really understand why he would want to keep them is to have an open discussion with nothing on the table. Deletion isn't even discussed just help me understand the attachment. 

Not everyone has the same boundaries, there could be some sense of accomplishment in the case of videos. It's remembering a moment in time that you were not a part of. Those memories are his. Doesn't mean he's pining just fondness for the past. "
414,I dont think there is any advice. You just need to control it. Everyone feels a little bit of jealousy.
415,"Keeping nudes of your ex is both disrespectful to that ex and to any new partners. Consent is revoked when a relationship ends for any photos I sent while seeing someone. If I found out that my ex kept nudes of me, and then refused to delete them out of respect for me and his new girlfriend, I would think that guy is gross and pure scum.

&amp;#x200B;

Any person who respects people deletes nudes when a relationship ends. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact you're even trying to make excuses for him is pretty ridiculous. It's a simple issue. Delete the nudes and be an adult, dude. "
416,"It sounds great, but that doesn't work. What if he doesn't call the plumber immediately...does OP just not get to pee at home? 


And if they split finances/have a tight budget, there's might not be a ""him paying for it""."
417,"Well, I’ve never had a conversation with her. I’m a teacher, so I’m usually busy with the students when she’s in the same room. Also I have about 20+ assistants that I work with on and off, not too mention the 100+ students.

The truth is, I definitely could have learnt her name, but I didn’t. Not really sure why. Maybe being overwhelmed or maybe I was just lazy."
418,"It doesn't matter. If she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you, she doesn't have to be. It is her present attitude that counts; not whether she enjoyed being with you from before. Everyone is entitled to change their mind."
419,"Get therapy. Or enter a self help group. You sound as if its actively impacting your life to a point where it isn't normal jealousy anymore (which is, well, normal) but becoming overwhelming."
420,So call your pediatrician and get their opinion?

422,HORRIBLE advice.  Just awful.
423,I think you'd be wise to figure yourself out first before including someone else in your life.  It's a good plan. 
424,"This is just sad. Your SO should never have nudes of past girlfriends. It is not like porn, you don't know those people and it is a fun way to get arroused. But pictures of someone you had intimacy with, and a life with is holding onto the past. You said you know he is not cheating, but you don't actually know that. I would proceed with caution but it is highly unusual that he has these photos and feels that it is ""a part of his life"" that you would be taking away from him.. he basically just told you that these naked girls who he has a past with are still apart of his life and you are completely okay with it? Do not seek sympathy when this blows up in your face because he is giving you all the red flags. "
425,"&gt; Are you now making more money than him? And also, how have things been otherwise?

No, I'm not making more money than he is. The gap has closed a bit, but he still earns more. Things have really sucked actually and they don't seem to get better."
426,"&gt;I thought that since he’s dating new GF now, we would be able to be good friends again (we were quite close even before we started saying) but it’s been a huge awkward fest around him

That probably isn't realistic. It's hard going back to the way things were with an ex. Whether you like it or not, being romantically involved with someone changes things, even if you break up amicably. I imagine he is worried about how his new girlfriend feels, and doesn't want to make her feel like he still has feelings for you. 

Being friends with him is okay, but expecting to be good buddies and go right back to being close is unrealistic. He's keeping distance from you because he doesn't want to damage his new relationship. 

Why do you think she wouldn't have told your ex that she invited you? I would assume she asked if he'd be okay with it before she even made the invite. If you want to go, go. "
427,"Yeah I guess my argument is that there's more to being single than just fucking other people. Being able to make those decisions (like being an astronaut) on your own without considering your partner's feelings isn't NOTHING. I recently had a great opportunity in a new city, but my partner didn't want to move, if I was single, I would've taken that opportunity in a heartbeat, but I love my partner more than I love this new job. 

It doesn't sound like OP would make that same decision. She wants permission to break up... with the assurance that its a good decision. Truth is, if you're feeling this way, then its the right decision. Pretty much as soon as you're wavering on this feeling, the relationship is over. There's no magical way to make breaking up easy and not painful. Just gotta do it."
428,That can literally kill your child. Additionally the unvaccinated children and a lot of other people. No way.
429,It should bother you...  Make decisions based on this.  
430,It's extremely immature to act like that. Stop responding to her and just cut her off and move on 
431,You can't leave a 2 month old in a car seat for more than an hour or two.
432,"Since it is such an odd response I don't know if there is a guess of what she meant that is more likely than another. It could be banter, it could be that for some reason she's not interested in talking to you and that was her shutting you down, etc.

how is her english otherwise?"
433,She needs to be doing more and it is ok to tell her that.
434,"You need to 100% die on this hill.  Tell your wife that there is no way in hell you are taking a 2 month old baby on vacation to be around their unvaccinated cousins.  If she wants to go she can go without you or the baby. 

Get your pediatrician involved have them explain to your wife exactly how dangerous this can be. "
435,I really don't think I'm dead wrong. I think everyone experiences love differently and there is love in many different capacities. 
436,Sam doesn't come over any more. Period.
437,"Are your friends actually people that you want to bond with, or just people that it's fun to drink with? Do you ever hang out with them sober--actually do activities (movies, shopping, hiking, whatever), or is it just about getting drunk? What about hanging out with them 1:1?


I don't drink at all. Did a bit more at 22, but not that often/much. I think you should branch out your social circle. Go to meetups organized around activities. Look into volunteering. See if your local subreddit has a social group. Yes, a lot of people/social activities, especially at your age, may focus on drinking, but the more you branch out, the more new people you will meet. 


Definitely don't destroy your health. And think about if your friends are people who care about your health."
438,"I know this isn't the question, but why on earth would you plan to live with a friend for at least FIVE years when you're both in your early 20s? That would be a strange assumption, since people in their 20s often move in with boyfriends or get new job opportunities in different cities. 

I also noticed you are very insistent about things not bothering you (""no hard feelings whatsoever,"" ""totally fine with \[X thing that you're obviously venting about\]."" I just want to reassure you that it is OK to feel angry or bothered about something. Yes, it's stupid that you couldn't have your boyfriend stay over on a weekend when hers stays over every other day, without paying rent I assume. It's OK to be bothered by that. I encourage you to read the ""Cool Girl"" passage of *Gone Girl.*"
439,"Seriously lady, this u/pmitten is so right! Your post history is beyond depressing and you are setting such a poor example for your daughter. You don't have to live this life, divorce him! You've said it yourself that you were a single mom for ten years before marrying this douchebag. Is he really worth all the stress, the constant threats against you, taking credit for your accomplishments, etc.? He sounds like a narcissist and you need to get yourself and your daughter out of this mess ASAP! "

445,"As children that would be child abuse. As adults, it would simply be assault, In both cases, a crime in most places.

Definitely move out, consider cutting contact with them. You describe your parents as intense people, I would describe them (or certainly your dad) as violent.

If either of your parents hit you you're justified in using reasonable force to defend yourself.

What's happening to you is not normal, or acceptable. The fact that it's your own parents doing it makes it worse, not better."

447,"You need premarital counseling.

As part of that you need to discuss finances.

Then after you get back from the honeymoon you can look at clearing her debts as you go forward with the new marriage.
"
448,They might have thought it would help solidify the break up/force her to move on. It’s her that’s going to have to realize that checking in with the friends and hoping for a reconciliation is futile. 
449,"They’re not wrong for liking it. But they’re in a relationship, and the very public display of cartoon porn is making their SO uncomfortable. That should be dealt with."
450,"&gt;Im finding myself resorting to not speaking up for myself rather than have to deal with overhearing myself being talked about in 5 minutes time. This morning I just stayed upstairs for 2 hours before work rather than having to come down into the livingroom knowing I've just been getting whined about again.    



Have you talked to her about this? Because it's very important that you feel comfortable in your own home, and at the moment you don't. You need to explain how it makes you feel.    



I mean yeah, we all need someone to vent to every now and again. But typically this isn't someone else who is a guest in your home and it's definitely not supposed to be within EARSHOT of the person you are venting about. It's little wonder you feel ganged up on.     



This is one of those issues which is as simple as sitting down with your gf (obviously alone, maybe go out somewhere so you won't be disturbed?) and telling her that while you want her to have an outlet for when she needs to get things off her chest, it puts you in an *incredibly* awkward position when that person is living with you both and you can hear every word they are saying. Tell her that you feel uncomfortable in your own home, as everything you do ""wrong"" (no matter how trivial) is then reported to her friend for discussion which makes you feel like a naughty kid. Ask her to talk to YOU if there is an issue, don't just go running to her friend who is sitting in the next room. If she's a reasonable human being, she should understand that. If she's not....then I don't know what to tell you. "
451,"Thats not necessarily true. When you are in a relationship you ARE tied down. Unless you're a terrible partner, you SHOULD consider your partner's feelings before making any big decisions like traveling or moving cities or changing jobs or going back to school.

There's also something to be said about her wanting to go out and him being a homebody. Even if your homebody partner is super understanding of your needs, there's still a tinge of guilt you feel when you go out all the time while your partner stays home.

Yeah, it does sound like OP wants to fuck other people. But it also sounds like she genuinely doesn't want to be tied down.

And at 21... I kinda don't blame her. Especially when it sounds like she's just not that into her boyfriend from this description. She's comfortable... not in love... which means she should do them both a favor and break up. 

The truth is you're never completely ""over"" someone when you break up with them. You're always going to feel a tinge of guilt, of ""what if this is a bad decision"", but if you're over it.. you're over it. Best to rip of the bandaid and move on with your life."
452,"I had to double-check the ages. Holy shit. Grown-ass man, bitching like an 18 year-old about this...Sam needs to grow the fuck up and get a life."
453,"Are you guys in the US? There are some major flaws with her plan if you are, and I'm telling you this as a med student. I can get into that if you want me to.

I honestly don't think you should do it. At this age, you are just establishing your career. She is asking you to uproot your life for her when her plans are not set in stone."
454,"You're all teenagers and this is silly teenage drama. It still hurts and is confusing, but ultimately he's just being dramatic in the way a 17-18 year old guy wanting to make a big grand gesture would. It really doesn't have anything to do with you all, mostly likely. I wouldn't bother looking for a reason, if there even is one it's likely pretty absurd and so what good would it be anyway?"
455,"""Decent hygiene"" has nothing to do with catching, say, measles, which is an airborne infection.  Per the CDC:

""Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. Infected people can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears.""

So the nieces and nephews could make the baby ill before anybody even realizes they're sick.   Babies *die* of measles, chickenpox, whooping cough, ...    This is like driving down to Florida without putting the baby in a car seat."
456,"You are her side piece, she is probably still seeing the person she is in a relationship with. "
457,Oh yeah I just googled it.  2 hours MAX.  
458,"I think that's a broad generalization.  My fiance used to watch hentai (I think he preferred it over porn involving real people, to be honest).  I also think that he had only minor issues, rather than deep ones, about women that he's corrected easily since we've gotten together (objectification, mostly, but it was nothing that conversations and some exposure to a woman's actual perspective didn't fix).

I'm sure there are other men out there that don't discuss their use of hentai, and have little to no issues OR have the same issues that any man who watches and loves watching pornography in general has."
459,"I mean you did nothing ethically wrong but of course it's going to make her feel badly, like she never mattered to you at all."
460,"Tell your BF that if he won't sack up and confront Sam to his face, then you will. Then follow through. Don't let someone disrespect you in your own home."
461,"Not saying this is the case for you two, but just throwing it out there. My boyfriend often says “we” aren’t romantic people, when it’s really that HE isn’t romantic. I would love more romance/what some people consider cheesy. So she may love the amped up “cheese” factor, even if that’s not a day to day occurrence for y’all. You know her better than we do, though, so take this with a grain of salt!"
462,"Funny that you say that, I was thinking of doing something along these lines. This lake supposedly has a lady of the lake that haunts it, so I was thinking of telling her this specific dock is supposedly where she died, then taking her to the end of the dock to see if we could hear her. "
463,"But at the same time I get where she was coming from to start messaging this other guy, I had changed over the last few months and didn't treat her as well as I had in the past, and then it was my idea to take a break. It just hurts to know she continued messaging him even when she and I had agreed we were both trying to make things work..."
464,"&gt; He’s threatened to leave me on several occasions.

You need to let him go.   The fact that you are married after only being together 1.5 yrs total is a red flag.   He wanted a wife he could look down on so he could feel better about himself.  He can't handle your success."
465,"I would understand if it were the case, but since our relationship wasn’t very long they barely talked to each other before. They haven’t seen each other a lot too."
466,"You should've posted this as an independent comment, then that independent comment should be top comment."
467,"Because he doesn't actually understand finance.

&gt; I do have interest on my school loans. I pay about $160/mo right now, but plan to start paying it off in 10k chunks (but had a goal to hit 100k first, which will happen by the end of this year at the rate I've been saving). "

476,"Wow this gave me that perspective I was looking for, so I thank you very much. I didn't even think about any of this. Maybe being a guy, it isn't common for me to go through that. So now I feel mildly ashamed that I am doubting her because apart from these problems she's been wonderful and lovely to be around. I haven't even seen her in person since then incident, and with work, I'm not sure when I'll see her but I'm gonna calm down. "
477,"Can’t move out. I don’t think I can stay with someone else. I don’t think a school counselor would be useful, or my parents would get on my case about telling people their business. "
478,"I am just over £900 in debt and am hoping to be debt free in about 5 months time so my amount isn't anywhere near your fiances. If my partner offered to loan me that money to pay it back, i personally would not offer it because I would feel guilty and I'd struggle to see the relationship in the same way.  


This doesn't have to be the case for yourself or your fiance but I would seriously think about it before talking to her about it because finances are a really delicate matter in any relationship."
479,Ah fair enough. I didn’t see that part. 
480,Open your own account and write off what she owes you. She ain't paying it back

482,"It's also possible they just live in an expensive area. I'm in the DC area and rent for a 2 bedroom apartment is around 2400-3000. A 1 bedroom or studio will likely be around 2K and not include parking. 
Yes, you can get cheaper but I have seen some of the cheap apartments in the area and only a couple hundred less they are pretty much a shit hole and not in a safer area. I think looking for cheaper rent is good if that is an option but it's not always possible.

Hell even when I lived in Baltimore I was paying 900/month to live in a 3BD3BA in a relatively safer area. Cheaper is NOT ALWAYS an option."
483,"If he won't listen to you, then I'd say when the pipes do clog, tell him he's in charge of calling the plumber and paying the bill. "
484,"Hey OP, you and I have had very similar experiences with our mothers. Mine was very verbally and emotionally abusive with a bad temper that I could never predict when it was going to explode. There was also occasional physical abuse. I was afraid of her for a long time and avoided her as much as I could. 

Like you, I had a blow-up with her years after I had moved out and not had much of relationship with her that ended up being the final straw. I sent her a text message after she went him telling her that I was tired of how she had always treated me, that I hadn't loved her in a long time, and that I did not want her to contact me anymore. Then I blocked her on all platforms. Like your mother, mine has not respected my wishes and has numerous times to get in touch with me and every instance has been some version of telling me that it either wasn't as bad as I remember, or that things didn't happen the way I said they did if they even happened at all, or that I deserved it when they did. I haven't responded and have no plans to. 

I like my life better without her in it. It's a weight off my shoulders. No more walking on eggshells, no more being judged, no more bullshit. If you prefer yours without her in it, stay no contact. You don't owe her anything."

486,"It does hurt from the perspective of the other person to hear that your new ex is already moving on, I've been in those shoes. But you have no obligation to remain faithful to her after the relationship is over, that wouldn't make any sense. Don't feel too bad."
487,"You said you spend a lot of time on /r/personalfinance ... so how do you have such a lack of understanding about interest rates??
"
488,"So, you got married less than a year ago, he (prior to your promotion) made 25k more than you annually, complained incessantly about the cooking and compared to to his ex (as you do all the housework and cooking) and now he's jelly that you're catching up and doing something for yourself?

What exactly IS good about this man, because other than motorcycle culture, it seems like y'all have nothing in common and that he undermines you at every turn."
489,"This seems like it's too much risk for too little chance of things being good. Like, it'll probably be fine, if there's going to be a lot of people and you won't be stuck interacting with your ex and his new girlfriend, but I don't know anybody who would actually enjoy themselves in that scenario.

Just say you have plans and can't make it but you hope she has a great birthday. Those plans can be binge watching Scandal or something, but they don't need to know that."
490,Talking to her it's what I wanted to do from the start. But as things are right now I would like to make some time pass. Just to give her space and most importantly to really understand what I did wrong 
491,"Even if it was his idea (which I seriously doubt) he's an asshole for trying to cash in on YOUR hard work.  YOU got the job, not him.  

Congratulations on your promotion OP, this random internet stranger is super proud of you!"
492,*Morpheus voice* You take a chance either way. I'll leave it up to you.
493,Distance doesnt mean ghosting keep contact to a minimum is what im saying. Stay professional during dance class.
494,"Man, I dunno. I'm not sure good hygiene is gonna keep the measles away. "
495,I wouldn't say good chance but it is definitely very risky. 
496,"I think it makes you less attracted to him to see him sexually idolizing female characters drawn to be sexually idolized, but I could be projecting. Women feel objectified enough in society, so it's not weird for you to get less attracted to your partner seeing him displaying this stuff in his room like a shrine. Obviously there is a point where insecurities will sneak in and need to be avoided, but I could interpret this poster and his reaction as callus and disrespectful. Agreeing with other posters, do not frame the issue in this way, frame the issue by expressing how this makes you feel matter-a-factly and what he would need to do to fix it. I find when people fight to defend silly things like this at the cost of the way you are feeling after you let them know - it's a good indicator as to how much you are valued as a person and equal in that relationship. Good luck lady!"
497,So your friends 'canceled' you because you made a joke about a racist doing racist things. Are you sure this is something you should be upset about?
498,Thank you man. I'll ask him. 
499,"You realize Pornhub puts different categories for different likes/dislikes, right? Everyone likes different things. So if you do like something or understand it automatically its weird/wrong? 

That is the exact thought process that causes people to eventually be racist. I know this example is a little extreme lol but people looked at other races and ethnicities and said ""I dont understand this therefore it's weird and wrong"".

Again I dont like anime either. But judging others on their interests that have literally nothing to do with you or anyone else just seems wrong. Obviously in this case it bothers OP and therein lies the problem but otherwise peoples likes and dislikes doesn't affect anyone but themselves. "
500,Affairs are not about enticement...they are about emotional boundaries.
501,"You need to do some research into abusive relationships. Her actions aren't suspicious, they're the signs of someone that was clearly abused. And a lot of it isn't even her fault. She can't really help someone trying to contact her even when she's stopped helping them out. And she probably read his letter because she's scared to death of this guy. If someone's shown they don't mind harming you, you probably aren't going to let a letter they sent you go unread so easily.

You don't have to stick around in this relationship, but it's pretty disrespectful to pin the consequences of an abusive relationship on the victim."
502,Break up with him already
503,"No, he does not get to treat you like shit because his parent died. When my father died I somehow managed to not call my bf names and if I treated him like he treats you I would fully expect to be dumped. Your bf is 10 years older then me but has the emotional control of a child. Ask yourself, when your parent dies do you think you can treat your bf the way he is treating you? And how do you think your bf would react to that? 

You aren't being understanding right now, you are being a doormat in an abusive relationship. "
504,Break up with him now. Be honest and move into the spare bedroom just as roommates until you graduate
505,"It doesn’t sound good to me. I’ve been in that situation. You deserve someone with more depth. I couldn’t imagine not getting into deep discussions with my husband. And I used to not be able to with an ex. I just settled and figured this is how he is, because there’ll always be a line of people out the door saying they too deal with this. And so if they deal with it too, then I can. No. It’s a very lonely life. "
506,"Indeed. I've been wondering that myself. 

The only good news with these issues is:
* they've been consistent since the beginning 
* have only improved, not gotten worse, and
* they're often about dumb shit"

508,I will. Thank you. 
509,"The first rule of keeping platonic friendships from drifting into infidelity, is to communicate with your partner and respect their feelings.   The OP shouldn't have to hide how she feels from her husband and his dismissive ""we were friends before so its okay"" is not at all respectful.

The insecurity is hers and there's no real point to arguing chicken or egg.  The bottomline is that Kevin should be allowed to explore a friendship with Alice without being accused of having an affair just because she has a vagina, rather than a penis.

Of course, I still endorse the concept of him talking to his wife about this whole situation and trying to alleviate her concerns and/or balance his time better.  But, yours and other posts are jumping off the deep end before even knowing if the pool is filled with water."

514,"Jealousy and insecurity are natural sometimes, but how one deals with it is what's important. He's acting as if you two are competing entities. He's not acting like a partner. Y'all are a team.

516,"I agree that our relationship is often predicated on selfishness.  We set up the webcam account with the intention that it would be both of us doing it.  I have been very open and receptive to anything she wants in bed.  If she asks for something, I do it.  She has a disregard for me all the time.  She tries to control who i spend time with, she pulls me away from my hobbies because she has separation anxiety, I'm like a taxi service for her, she throws tantrums when she doesnt get her way, In the middle of sex she has told me i need to go to the gym more because my arms werent big enough.  She has also caused me to fail test for college because she has pulled me away from studying to deal with her issues.  She definitely is taking care of HERSELF at my expense.   

\*In regard to her comments about my physical appearance, I run, I do jiu Jitsu, I rock climband i hike frequently.  I am not out of shape.  This was a cruel thing to say during sex. Had the tables been reversed it would have been a big deal to her.

&amp;#x200B;

  I think I should probably write a more lengthy post just detailing all of the issues in our relationship.  The sex thing is just kind of an add on to that (and it irks me the most).  I suppose I can see why i might appear to be some sort of selfish pig based on just my post.  Thank you for the thoughtful reply though.

517,Merp personally... I love the timing. Your first evening in a new home. And this is just me personally but I dont care for the rose petals idea and a lot of girls i know agree and I dont care for the bedroom idea. It feels 1970s cliche and cheesy and too sexual. Do you have a pleasant yard instead? Maybe put up a handful of framed pictures of you guys? Some neutral candles on the porch? Sipping tea or wine together?
518,So should I talk to her again to really understand what she wants to do? Sometimes I think that she just told me that she could still like me just to make it less painful... Not sure tho 
519,Thank you very much. ☺️
520,"&gt;This part made me laugh. What a nonsense. There are allot of woman out there that just don't match with the ""standard"" kind of woman. 

Yeah, there are a *lot* of us. So we can make friends with each other. If you can't get along with *any* woman, then the problem is you.

What's more, just because I'm not into hairstyles, makeup, The Bachelor, or other ""standard"" stuff, whatever that means,  doesn't mean that I can't be friends with someone who is. People can have completely different interests from me and still be good, decent, people."
521,He's already paying 100% of the bills.   Proportional sharing for everything would make sense but right now he's paying far more.
522,"Depends on your views on money. I'm on the mind that when you get married, you're a team, and you should share all the monies and debts and expenses. Making that financial team is a huge part of why I wanted to get married.


So, from my point of view, you using your savings to pay off her debt is a no brainer. We, as a team, wipe away your debt. 

That mindset doesn't apply to everyone, and I don't think there's a right or wrong way to veiw it. 

The second point though, is if you think her debt is a result of bad money habits. If it is, yeah, you can wipe out her debt, but you don't solve the problem. Even if you have my view on sharing money, simply eliminating her debt will not teacher her financial responsibility, and you may just have this same problem later. "
523,"I had similar issues with my hair. I have super kinky curly hair, a cross between 3c/4a. Everyone in my family had worn their hair straight all their lives, and I stopped straightening when I was 14. I went away to boarding school and college, so while I did get a ton of backlash, I didn't have to deal with it much, just during breaks. I always stood my ground, no I'm not straightening it, but I gave in quite frequently. Now I have recently returned home and my mother is of course nagging me about my hair. I have politely, but firmly told her I have no interest in spending my time or money in something I don't care for. She said, ""Even if it makes me happy?"" And I said, yes, because your happiness should not depend on the texture of my hair.

My mother knows she does this because of her insecurities with her own hair. She has very fine, but kinky hair and much of it is falling off. She wears weaves and wigs frequently, and often laments, ""You have so much hair! Imagine how nice it would be if you straightened it and got a weave."" Because that to her, is her idea of beauty and femininity. It's something she longs for and so, she assumes her daughter must long for it, and just doesn't know better.

Really, this is going to be a battle my mom and I will fight forever. For nearly ten years we've struggled and no one is any closer to winning. The only thing that has helped my relationship with my mother over this is living on my own so she can't have any say on how I live my life. You don't have to cut your mom out, but it's definitely easier to stand your ground against someone when you don't depend on them. She will always bring up the hair thing, but hopefully as time goes on, she will learn to tolerate your choices even if she doesn't necessarily agree with them."
524,"No, that’s not how this works... she keeps the cat and pays for it entirely. If she is bad at money she will now have to be better with her finances so she can afford it. "
525,"I think you are making a lot of unfounded assumptions. I wrote a lot about Rico because it's about Rico and how I have feelings I don't want to have towards him.

I guess someone who isn't vegan might assume veganism is unattractive, but I assure you, women who are vegan prefer vegan guys and it's even joked about in the community as one of the fastest ways to make a girl wet. Veganism implies several things: 1. he's man enough and secure enough to take the criticism that people like you make 2. he's extremely empathetic and understanding, making him the most sweet and lovable man I've ever wanted to devour instantly 3. he cares more about animals and the environment than selfishness, peer pressure, and indoctrination and 4. blood flows better, increasing sex drive and sexual ability. 

Additionally, I mention that he's vegan because it's as big of a deal to me as, say, Christianity is to a Christian. It's not something I am willing to compromise on, which is ONE huge reason why any sort of relationship would not work with the other guy. 

I am extremely attracted to my boyfriend, both mentally and physically, otherwise I wouldn't be with him or try to discard these meaningless lusting feelings for the other guy. I had the same sort of desire to make my current boyfriend mine as well, when we first got together, except both of us were single. I FREQUENTLY refer to my boyfriend's dick as a ""god dick"" to our friends (I have no filter), because that's how I truly feel about it. We also have a blast together, constantly laughing and acting silly together, which is another thing I can't live without.

As I said, I am not compatible or even attracted to Rico's personality, only the danger of it and taboo kink of it, I am coming to define. My boyfriend, on the other hand, checks every box. Physical, mental, morality, life choices, communication, etc. He is the best boyfriend I've ever had in my life and could ever possibly dream of.


"
526,"It's very good your future wife basically has owned up to her debt and never asked you for anything. You are also planning to be with her for the rest of your life, so this internet stranger's impulse is that you should \*gift\* her the money and end her debt. As others have said, do NOT hold this money over her head and expect her to ever pay it back. If you don't think you can give her that money in good consciousness, do not help with her debt.

If I had that much savings and 60k debt total within the relationship, I'd advise generally wiping out as much debt as possible. However, again, I'm just an internet stranger, so definitely get yourself to a financial adviser and get some advice on the best way to tackle \*both\* your debt."
527,"So... From your phrase:

&gt;As much as I wanted it...

It doesn't sound like your relationship is nearly as platonic as you tell yourself it is.  This WILL be a problem with current and future relationships for both of you.

Honestly, I'd give her space and back up on some of your established norms of behavior. Only seeing each other in public or in group settings is a good place to start."
528,"Sure, OP. And good to know that you have plans now, go get it girl!!! :) I wish you all the best! "
529,"Therapy. Definitely therapy. There are underlying reasons why you react (note I didn’t say “respond”) the way you do, and in order to truly alter that habit, You’ll need to do some exploration on why you do it in the first place, what’s underneath, and work on healing whatever it is. We carry around very deep, very pervasive, typically unconscious wounds that cause us to react in ways that aren’t productive, and it’s virtually impossible to stop doing it through sheer force of will.

It would be especially beneficial for you to sort this out as much as possible before having children, because screaming at our kids just passes on the damage. "
530,"No, unfortunately you don't have a right to know more. And you shouldn't try to find out. It sucks when people decide to move on with their own private reasons, but the only thing you can really do is keep moving forward without them."
531,"I think you should ask him one-on-one, just casually who the woman was because you hadn't seen her before."
532,People always think that nothing will happen until it does.  You can call Adult Protective Services and ask for an evaluation.  Sometimes an outside force can convince people more than family can.
533,"No you didn't cheat on her. That being said, you moved on very very quickly, and of course she's going to be hurt by hearing you've slept with another woman 2/3 days after she was begging you to come back. While you haven't done anything technically wrong, you can't expect her to think about this logically instead of emotionally. If you care about her I do think you should be mindful of what she hears from others. Live your life, you're single, but you know hearing about you with other women will hurt her, so try to limit that if possible. "
534,"&gt; My dad was always working on cars, building something, doing something productive and I’ve always looked forward to seeing my child enjoying things like that with their dad. 

mmmhmmmm.  

The mean girls thing didn't get ya, nor did the comment about disrespecting your spouse......nope it was about bringing daddy up?  Methinks I hit a nerve."
535,"Friend, you have much more deep seeded issues than wanting to get off and I’m glad you’re recognizing that. Tackle those issues before you even get to sex. Sex is nothing in a relationship compared to mutual respect and trust. Sex comes easily with those things. Work on the foundation first—if that doesn’t work, leave. "
536,"You’re right, but I do often find reading other’s experiences good grounds for balance or just to see what others do in similar situations, but you’re right.  

Your second question could be it’s own thread. My oldest has autism, and so he functions very differently than the rest of my kids. Ultimately, my husband struggles tremendously to understand all the ins and outs of the diagnosis and therefore stumbles quite a bit on parenting him, which then brings so much friction to our relationship. "
537,"I don't think what's ""normal"" is the important thing here. What's important is whether your needs are being met by your relationship and whether you are happy with it. There are people out there who save the deep emotional conversations for people other than their partners and are fine with it. There are people out there who don't consider it a romance without the deep emotional conversations. What matters is how important this is to you."
538,"People grow and change in many different ways.  Sometimes they feel the best thing for themselves is far different than the way they've been living.  It sucks, but you should try and understand they have their reasons and it's probably difficult for them to do.  Just have to let it go and move on yourself. "

542,"Me too. She was exceptionally violent anytime she didn't get her way. One day she hit her much younger partner as well who was more of a parent to me than she ever was. I snapped and put my hand on her throat and started squeezing. I had to be physically restrained. She never raised her hand on me or anyone else in my presence.

543,"So me having nice memories of my dad and wanting the same for my kids means I have ""issues""?"
544,"Glad to give you a chuckle!

It takes a lot to admit that. You sound like a driven and highly capable woman, you can definitely handle this. Future you will thank the you of today for making the tough calls to get her to her bright future. And hey, congrats on your promotion! That was a lot of smart maneuvering and hard work, it’s wonderful it finally paid off for you! Good luck in your career and new life (not that you’ll need it). "
545,"Yeah agreed, if my friends didn't include me in something (and sometimes they don't) I'd just figure that it was something that doesn't concern me. After all, they're still contacting her and inviting her to stuff, so obviously they don't hate her. If it was really that concerning she could have just asked, ""What are y'all whispering about?"" Which would allow them to come up with a suitable explanation until the party and have the awareness of ""Shit, she's gonna find out, we better hide better."""

549,"Write them a letter. Give them each their own copy -- I wouldn't assume they would share it.

If you are in high school, talk to a school counselor. There should be a psychologist or someone on staff to help students struggling with different things. They may have some ideas...or even be willing to call in your parents, ostensibly to talk about you, but really to give them the heads' up that their bickering is going to create a problem."
550,"Was he relatively recently out of a relationship sometime before you got together? Sometimes in a ""rebound"" relationship people skip the dating phase and jump straight to acting like longterm partners."
551,"I think you’re doing the right thing by putting your child’s health first. I know she really wants a vacation but it’s just not good timing. I’d stand your ground and she will eventually understand. 

Or offer formula for the baby if she wants to vacation? It’s less harmful than the child being around unvaccinated children without their 2 month old shots honestly. "
552,This is 100% a hill to die on. You do whatever is necessary to protect your child. 
553,I've offered to watch both. She said there's no way she could drive down there by herself and him. Her parents are flying. 
554,"Not every relationship has the ""honeymoon phase"" and that doesn't mean it's unhealthy or doomed. If you are both happy and satisfied in your relationship then I wouldn't be worried about it. That said, you mention that you try to give him what he wants/needs from a girlfriend and worry about burdening him, but i'm concerned maybe you are neglecting your own desires a bit as a result. It's not unreasonable to talk to him about sometimes wanting to be ""wooed"" or have some more romantic gestures in your relationship.   In fact I think it's healthier to talk to him about it than to keep it to yourself and risk having it become a bigger issue as time passes. "
555,"Is it possible that there have been other conversations with her, in which he has been less then flattering about you? 

If not, her reaction does seem very extreme.

I also think that it's weird that she doesn't understand the basic principal of having to check in with your partner before you make social plans - which is what most of us do. 

However again, it could be that she has a false impression of you based on other things that your boyfriend has said. 

I think your approach should be the same, whether your boyfriend has played a role in this or not. 

Firstly, I would welcome her in to your home and be really friendly. She needs to see the real you, not some warped version of you that she has in her head. 

Secondly, I think you need to point out to your boyfriend that if he wants the two of you to get along in the future that he has to correct her false impression of you. Whether it's partly his fault, or just a total misunderstanding, his friend has the wrong idea about who you are and what your relationship is like and he ought to make some effort to resolve that. "
556,"Hey dude. I think it’s best to stay and work on yourself. You’re very young so I would say just to give her space and enjoy your time as a single man. Nothing crazy but just try to enjoy things. There’s plenty of time to find someone. You’ll start getting experiences and mature more, and start making the right calls too. If she wants you, it should be willingly from her side. "
557,"I get that the Bay is expensive but I think your comment is a bit dramatic. I make literally half of what you’re saying you need to make to live here and I live a comfortable life. If OP makes even a bit more than me she could afford car payments. I don’t live in SF proper but if she’s living in the East Bay she’ll still get the benefits of the CA weather, vibe, and lifestyle she’s probably been dreaming of."
558,"No, you're not being ridiculous to ask that you don't go this year. Is there any way that you would consider staying home with the baby while she goes with your 3 year old? Depending on the duration of the trip it might be possible. "
559,It kind of makes me feel like he doesn't care about me as much since we went straight from hooking up to domestic dating. I know it's absurd but I kind of wish we followed the old school wooing--&gt; relationship thing. But I'm not sure if that's just because I watched too many movies or whatever.

Can you suggest her going on vacation with the older one and you staying home with the 2 month old? "
562,Tell them you need it yourself then because you dont feel like you'll be able to have a healthy relationship because of the example you've been given.  Recomend it for you younger siblings as well.  If they dont smarten up from that at least you guys will all be better off
563,Why don't you try scheduling date nights and asking him to be more spontaneous and romantic? 
564,"OP, this unfortunately won't be the last time long term friendships end. It happens around this time in high school, it will happen in college, as you transition from job to job, and as friends start getting married and starting families.

That doesn't need to be a bad thing. Sometimes our friends are the right friends for certain points in our lives, and other friends are right for others. Just focus on moving forward with your goals in life, and appreciate the time you have with the people that enter into it. And if your friend wants to re enter your life at some point and tell you about whatever is/ was going on, just listen to what he has to say and make your decision from there."
565,"This! After having this issue being the low income with 2 exes I can tell you it is a horrible feeling trying to ""keep up"" with a partner. I work in vet care, which surprisingly, doesn't pay well. I adore my job, have side hustles and get perks like really cheap vet care. But my ex worked in insurance and didnt care that the houses we were looking at would demand over 90% of my monthly income and less that 40% of hers. She didnt care about the stress it caused that should could go on trips and shopping sprees and have, like real hobbies and stuff and I would have to do extra chores or extra shifts just to eat out at tge restaurants she liked. 

This doesnt sound like the same situation, just don't ignore the stress that puts on the relationship. "
566,Right but my question is why does it matter? 
567,"I asked to help encourage, not force. I can’t force anyone to do anything. And yeah I should communicate it, but we know it’s not an easy thing to say. I just get sick of things sometimes "
568,"I could never be with someone who didn’t make me laugh- everyday preferable but at least occasionally. Sense of humor can be an incompatibility. But the fact that he gets offended over it is super weird- that alone would be enough of a turn off on my end. 

Not having anything in common can be good, if you have a genuine interest in getting the know the other person and explore their hobbies. But this guy sounds like a dead fish. Throw him back in and find something more lively!"
569,"I guess I just expected him to grow out of them, like I've seen happen with my brothers and friend's partners"
570,"Next steps:

I think everyone covered the birth certificate/SSN card. Getting out of your parents house might be trickier. If there is a time where she is gone all day, you might be able to do it while she's gone. If she rarely leaves the house, then you might have to slowly smuggle stuff out. Since you're still in school, any chance you can start packing valuables &amp; other things in your bag, bringing them to school, then to your bf's parents' house after? Start with anything she can break or that's worth money, so that if she finds out and gets destructive, that stuff is gone. Smuggle as much as you can out of the house this way until you're ready to move.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you are ready to move, make sure to have other people there as witnesses and to help you get the rest of your stuff out as quickly as possible. Be careful, do not engage any of her abuse, and do not be alone with her at all. You are going to be removing yourself from her control, which will likely enrage her and can make her more dangerous than before.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're very worried, I would also consider calling the police. Let them know you are trying to move out and your mother could potentially become violent. Most stations will send an officer down to hang out for a little bit to ensure your safety."

572,Literally every thread in this sub someone says the op needs counseling.  As usual it doesn't apply at all.
573,Not long. We got married rather quickly so we’ve been together a year and a half. 
574,"&gt;Husband thinks he suggested the idea which landed my promotion: he didn’t.

He wants credit for being supportive and encouraging you. My guess is he's being snippy and passive aggressive because ultimately he's insecure - maybe about you being successful on your own and not needing him.  Some men get irrationally afraid that when their SOs step up, get new success, or otherwise level up, they will suddenly find their man to be old and busted and start looking for the new hotness.  I am not saying this is OK, but it is a real thing. 

This sucks because you have worked hard and you shouldn't be punished by your husband's ego also needing reassuring, but that's my vague guess as to what's going on. 

Make sure he knows that you take a lot of pride in your own accomplishments and you don't appreciate him trying to make it about him.  At the same time make sure he knows you appreciate his support and encouragement, but you still take your accomplishments to be your own. "
575,Lol you broke up the point is you no longer care how she feels about what you do
576,we already got fined 
577,This is exactly it! No accusations no putting down etc just real communication. 
578,"&gt; But the fact that her husband doesn’t see this as a big deal - because to him it’s not, 

The fact that he doesn't see it as a big deal doesn't mean that it isn't.  People who get involved in this never think it's a big deal until they cross the final boundary.   Then they wail about how ""I never meant for this to happen"".

It's one thing when a partner has previously exhibited jealousy about opposite friendships.  But in the overwhelming number of cases, when it's something like this -- long time friendship suddenly becoming more -- the concerned spouse should take action"
579,"Honestly, how can you even be sure she actually broke up with that other dude. "
580,"Sometimes during a breakup, people say cliches like ""you aren't my type"" or ""I don't feel a spark"" or whatever to avoid saying the somewhat mean and cold hard truth: ""I don't like you enough to want to spend a lot of time with you and have a relationship."" That is what every reason (fake or otherwise) boils down to. Accept it and move on."
581,"Closure, at least in a situation like this, is bullshit. Do you really think that your former friend could give you any sort of reasonable explanation for his behavior that would leave you feeling okay with how things turned out? You'd either be left with more questions or be in disagreement, but you wouldn't be any happier with his decision. "
582,"If you go on the trip you will be setting the precedent that it's okay for husband to make decisions for you without consulting you.  


Though I suspect it's not the first time he's done this type of thing. :/


Please do not give up your voice or self-autonomy to appease his ego! 


""Husband, I'm not comfortable with anything about this trip.  Maybe next time we can plan a trip together that we both can agree on but I'm sitting this one out."""
583,"This is solid advice, OP. This is my husband also. "
584,"What, is she tainted now?"

There is literally nothing I would like to have in my house less than that, lol) I found that ultimately there was not much I could do. I tried the polite ""it's so nice of you to give me gifts, but we really have everything we need already!"" method. I tried the ""if you want to get something, well, my kid can always use new inexpensive clothes since she goes through them so fast"" method. Nothing changed. Ultimately I just decided to keep donating things.

If you don't have reason to believe she's ruining her own financial security by doing this, I'd just probably accept the gifts and keep donating them."
588,"On the converse, why should her boyfriend have to leave his home? Either way, it's twice a month max and isn't that big of a deal. She could work out or go grocery shopping or do a chore that requires leaving the house. Yeah, hosting the guys night at another place is ideal as well but we don't know what the other guys' places are like. They could live with their parents or somewhere dirty and/or unsafe. Relationships are about compromises and I would gladly do that for my partner as they would do for me. "

594,"I second this. You need to get tested. 

Why would you ever think about NOT breaking up with him? How could you ever trust him after this? I am so sorry you had to go through this and you did not deserve this, but your boyfriend cheated on you multiple times and you need to have some self respect and move on and no contact him. "
595,"What exactly are you looking for? You say you're not looking for a quick hookup, but you're using a dating app and you invited the guy to your apartment. Sucks he made you uncomfortable, and good for you that you could express that in the moment, but I'm not sure what he was supposed to assume there."
596,You two need to find the niche that you can see you both doing day to day. Have you played dungeons and dragons? Could get a small group for that. 
597,"Sam would never, ever be allowed back in my home again if he insulted my wife and wanted her gone. He sounds like a dick. Your bf should at least warn him that he has one last chance and that if he can’t handle you being around then he’s no longer welcome. "
598,Contrary to popular belief you can end up as good friends with your ex's. Its not common since involves maturity from both parties but its possible.
599,"He has disrespected you deeply, has put your safety at risk, and shows no signs of even the slightest remorse? What is there to figure out? He lied, cheated, deceived you...

&amp;#x200B;

601,"He's been friends with Sam since grade school? So he is missing the ""guys night""? That's what a couple of decades of friendship and probably decades of guys night? Give them all a guys night, it won't kill you to do it. Go out with your girlfriends on that night. Trust me you and he will both see the benefit of that. "
602,"She doesn't have to work in a restaurant, she could open a catering business, a food truck, a cafe, it's not like she has to be in this particular environment full time. She should probably talk to a therapist and people with culinary degrees who work in other aspects of the field. Line cooks have some of the worst hours and pay. "
603,"Yes. Unless you have an amazingly forgiving heart, you should break up with him. This is the worst kind of betrayal.

And also be very concerned about your health - whoever he was sleeping with - it’s a substantial number and you’ve been exposed to all sorts. Don’t take his word for anything and get tested. "
604,"I don't know honestly, I really want to give it a shot and be empathic as moving to a different country can be harsh on some people (we have no family and very few friends out here) so I'd like to give her some time.

She does cook a lot on her own to practice and learn new things, in fact this is sort of the only thing that makes her ""relax"" when she's really sad and, as I stated before, she's VERY talented at it. Her work though is very physical and she's not a super strong person (she's like 5'9 and they want her to carry around heavy boxes and whatnot) plus as you probably have heard people at restaurants are not particularly nice so I try my best to understand where she's coming from."
605,"Please keep your self respect and dump him ASAP. This is an absurd amount of betrayal.

I wouldn't trust his word, either. You should get yourself tested."
606,Listen to you gut. You're uncomfortable with this man in your house. The best thing you can do for both yourself and your siblings is to move out and keep yourself safe and healthy so you can help them later if you need to. Put yourself first. (Think oxygen masks on airplanes. Put yours on first.)
607,"Thank youuu! I can’t believe I had to scroll so far to find this comment.  I feel like everyone here is encouraging OP to be a doormat/cool girl.  OP, listen to /u/blasthead99.  There is no reason this 29 year old woman couldn’t find her own lodging.  Airbnb exists for a reason.  Your boyfriend is at the very least, emotionally overstepping here.  He’s prioritizing her over you.  Boundaries of opposite sex “friendships” need to be different when there are relationships involved. Don’t let him take advantage of you.  "
608,"&gt; When he's sober, he never remembers his words or actions when he was drunk.

Just to give you fair warning, this is a very, very good *excuse*, so good that people might want to act like it's true even when it isn't.

If Sam is genuinely blackout drunk when he's aggressive and obnoxious, well, phones record video these days.

Right now your BF is the one protecting Sam from his just and reasonable deserts.  Ideally he should take care of the problem to your satisfaction, but he's feeling anxious about that, so talk it through with him and make sure that it's just social anxiety and not ""the truth about Sam"" that's motivating the anxiety.  Maybe Sam's a nice guy who gets blackout drunk and acts mean or maybe he's a bully."
609,"haha alright, I wrote that kind of carelessly I know it sounds pretty bad. Not gonna lie, as a student I have always had my time occupied by so much schoolwork, and this is the first time I've had an easy schedule and have been feeling quite lonely with all the new free time.

612,"The best thing you can do for your daughter is to get out of this weird and manipulative relationship. 

He didn’t want you to work? Have you ever questioned why? It seems like he *wants* you to be completely dependant on him so you can’t leave. "
613,"I experience this as well. My mom isn’t a shopaholic per se but every holiday or gift giving event, she gives me a duffel bag full of plastic trinkets, strange games, dollar store items. I tried talking to her about it and it did not go well. I felt like I was being wasteful receiving these items that I won’t use. It just doesn’t mesh with my personality. One of the other commentators had it right- start dropping hints on a theme. Art supplies, cooking, pet supplies, things that goodwill, the shelter or the local elementary could really benefit from. In the end, think of it as you being a charitable medium. Sure, it doesn’t feel like charity if you yourself don’t want it, but it’s coming your way anyway, maybe get it to be something useful for others. 

I live out of state now from my mom and don’t experience this anymore but it was always so stressful. And also kinda a moment of- you don’t know me at all.... sadness. But the “love language” thing is real and gift giving is not so terrible since they are dollar store items. She isn’t going into debt to gift you. But yeah, this is how she is, so funnel the best you can and react sincerely to gifts on the theme. She will be excited by your reaction and keep supplementing a need, even if it isn’t yours."

618,"You make it easier by doing it consistently. When you initially say no and then cave, you've just taught people they just have to badger you to get what they want. You have to say no and then keep saying it."
619,"Oh and I swear sometimes I wanted to text him when we've almost split up because of this and say you can tell your sister she won, I'm gone. I've already told him that I'm getting tired of this and I have said I wanted to break it off on a couple of occasions. But we always somehow end up working it out. But I'm serious, if things do not change I really will be done with this.

 I'm 36 in May and I'm getting too old for this crap. This is something that younger people do, not people who are older and are supposed to know better. I guess some people never grow up though. I mean this woman is 49 years old. She should understand by now that her brother is going to have a romantic relationship with someone. A relationship that does not involve her whether she likes it or not. She seriously needs to learn some boundaries and quick otherwise she's going to destroy every relationship he ever tries to have."
620,"this is the first time you have talked to this classmate. I think you might be overstepping some boundaries? It seems like she doodled these things on her notes in class which points to her being bored. A lot of people joke ""KILLL MEEE I WANT TO DIE"" when theyre stuck in a long, boring class."
621,"This is probably beyond you to fix. If you've tried examining her evidence and talking through the statistics, and that hasn't done anything to help calm her anxiety about this, and she still insists that it's happening, then something else is going on here. How much impact does this have on her life or your life? I ask, because the higher the impact, hopefully the easier it will be to get her some help. Like, if she's missing work or important events due to this, then it's something she ought to want to fix one way or another. I mean, if you're sure she isn't actually being gang stalked (I assume so), and is obsessed over this, then she really needs to see someone, probably her regular doctor first (if she hasn't been in a while) to rule anything physiological/major, and probably at least a therapist or maybe even a psychiatrist if she does have some mental health issue. Obviously, you start by expressing your concern in a noninterventional way, but if she gets defensive about it being a problem, then it's going to be really difficult to convince her to get help. Does she have any close family members or friends you could talk to about this?"
622,I really hope so. 
623,"I would have maybe said wait and see until this ""he kicked me out and took my keys one night when we had a minor disagreement."" This guy is willing to strip you of your home and shelter over a minor argument. He's dangerous to your safety. Him going to therapy is so he can be a good partner for someone else down the road. You need to work on being safe. Plus, it is likely even if the therapy helps you'll always be waiting for him to get angry, and policing yourself, because you know what his anger looks like and it scares you. "
624,"You should inform him what you want from him and your feelings towards him are. And, he should tell you straight up if he wants the same or not. If you guys remain as friends, none of this complications should be going back and forth. 

Good luck."
625,Leave her and dont look back
626,"Dude, who hurt you?? "
627,"Check to see if there's any programs in your city that helps women find work, you might find things like a professional attire second hand store, resume preparation and job interview practice.  "
628,"You should absolutely do this. If it doesn’t work, go through with lawyers - but sometimes shame is a very effective solution. I’ve seen this work before back in college when some kids just didn’t get they were in the real world. 

Sometimes, the parents are hard working people who are embarrassed about the effect their kids are having on other people. Other times, you find out shit comes from shit and then it’s time for lawyers. "
629,"Emotional incest is a very strong way to phrase this issue - it's understandable that some commenters were taken a back. 

I'm a 20 year old female. My brother is 24 and has a fiance. I would never go sit myself between them on the couch. I would never walk into his room without knocking - especially if there's a chance either of us aren't fully dressed. And while I am not fond of his fiance, I would also never make those comments. And I would never leave my undergarments anywhere in his line of vision.

However, 

&gt; She relies heavily on my boyfriend for the emotional support that she should be getting from a\* partner 

this really bugged me. They are siblings. What is wrong with telling your sibling your problems and having your sibling over emotional support that you accept? I don't think it is really your place to say what amount of emotional support she should or should not be getting from her brother.

 I would be appalled if someone said this about my brother and I. I have cried on his shoulder more times than I can count. I text him when I am frustrated and going through hard times. He calls me when he is going through something or needs support and he'll ask me to come over if he needs company. That is a sibling relationship. 

The rest of it is weird, though. I don't doubt emotional incest on her part, but she could also just be a jealous person who has piss poor boundaries. Either way, I think you need to sit down with your husband and have another ""your sister treats me very poorly and you need to establish boundaries"" talk."

634,Actions speak louder than words. Talk to him about how it's not enough to just say that he misses you. 
635,"Lol same here

Like, was it an XBox One? 360?"
636,"Yes, what he 👆 said and get tested ASAP please. "
637,"Just think about how you'd feel if she was his male best friend, because imo she hasn't done anything a guy wouldn't do (disrespecting boundaries by flirting, etc.)

If you think what he does in that case is still wrong, then maybe your feelings are reasonable. If it's only wrong because she's a girl, you likely only feel that way put of jealousy. 

I completely understand because I'd probably be kinda jealous/worried too, but I'm also kinda insecure about things like that. "
638,"I think it’s time to accept that the damage has been done and both of you can’t go back in time. The relationship is unhealthy and there’s no trust left. I think you should leave and move home to your family. Breaking up sucks but this is just a disaster and I think you know that.

For the future just know a proper goodbye isn’t having sex and cheating on your bf. Take the next year to be single and work on yourself. You need a break to become independent and find yourself. Don’t drag this relationship out, it’s already over. Good luck! "

640,Just end it now. He’s not going to reciprocate feelings because that’s not what a fuck buddy does. 
641,"Everyone (but you) understands why the relationship would be strained.  Encouraging you to cry on her shoulder, vending about her daughter was messed up.  And you the fool took the bait"
642,"At 5 weeks, this is too much.

""Name, I think you're a great guy, but I'm not in a place to be in a relationship, so I am breaking up with you. I wish you the best in the future. I think it's best if we go no contact.""

644,"&gt;but he doesn’t see it a problem to constantly accuse me of wanting to cheat on him 

OP, among the mountain of evidence of emotional abuse you documented, this stood out. He's projecting here. He accuses you of wanting to cheat on him because he wants to cheat on you."
645,This just turned me on so much. Such a strong woman. I’d be an honor to be your bull ;) pm me.
646,This!!!  Great response. 
647,Emotionally killing your mom is not as bad as literally killing some innocent bystander with his car. I know it’s not easy and I’m not trying to blame you - but you have the opportunity to end this.
648,OP and BF are living together
649,"Not yet but I've been strongly considering it, have you done it with your SO? How would you recommend it?

Thanks for the reply :)"
650,"Had she ever seen the bracelet in person, or only pictures online? Depending on what it’s made out of she may be disappointed in how the non-photoshopped bracelet looks. 

$130 would buy a very nice sterling silver bracelet maybe with cheaper semi-precious gems like amythest or topaz. However that price for something in gold (or even silver) with diamonds or more expensive gems like sapphire, ruby, or tanzanite is going to look very very cheap in person to someone who's familiar with fine jewelry. 

I strongly recommend against buying jewelry online for this reason. The photos are zoomed in &amp; photoshopped to within an inch of their lives. Also, if you’re dealing with natural diamonds or gems Every. Single. Stone. Is unique. It’s not like buying a phone, where every unit is identically manufactured. You are not buying the stone in the picture, what you get could be dramatically different. 

You said you took a screenshot (as opposed to a picture) so I’m assuming she found it on the stores website and showed you. Just tell her if she’s unhappy with how it looks in person you want to take her to the shop to pick something together. Make a date night out of it. 

If she saw it in person before opening the box I think the advice to let it cool down for a bit and then offer again to go pick something together is probably the best. If she decides she wants to keep it after that just drop it. I worked in fine jewelry for 10 years and a LOT of women prefer to have the thing “he picked” even if they don’t love it. (Personally I’d want the “right” piece, but I’m extremely into jewelry and not very sentimental lol)"
651,"Let me translate what your thoughts and actions really mean.   

I just love [heroin:alcohol:cocaine:meth:GF] so much that I'm willing to erode my values, and degrade myself because I think more of [heroin:alcohol:cocaine:meth:GF] than I think of myself.      

[heroin:alcohol:cocaine:meth:GF] is so completely awesome that I'm nothing without [heroin:alcohol:cocaine:meth:GF] so my only option is to accept that my life is meaningless without [heroin:alcohol:cocaine:meth:GF].

657,"I don't blame him for not telling you about the expected baby, he barely knew you and as he said, didn't expect it to last. No one really expects much from relationships these days and there's no need to reveal everything about yourself up front. 

However, there's always the risk he's trying to trap you. Play it safe, keep your boundaries, get to know him before diving into anything too serious."
658,"Why not just break up with her before the year is over rather than waiting to end it if you already know that you want and intend to? It’s not fair to lead her on when you know full well you’re not committed to this relationship, and while ending it at the end of the year may be a “fresh slate” for you, it’s going to be the worst beginning of her year if you end things at that time. May as well break up with her now."
659,This is your wife's mother. You cheated on her with her mom. Obviously you two aren't good for each other and probably need to split up. But think about it. Not only is she going to lose you but the woman who raised her. There is no other bond than somebody and their parent. That is heart breaking. What your wife is doing to do is completely unacceptable but what you did is over the top. 
660,"So don’t blame her then? And stop judging her for how she responded to being victimized when it’s never happened to you and you can’t imagine what it’s like. You don’t know what you would have done in her shoes. After everything she has been through, do you want to be another person who lets her down?"
661,"Normal?  Really?  No man, this is way way way far away from normal.  This is obsessive, clingy and insane.  Actually insane.  She's being crazy.  Run."

664,"Yes, but I didn't commit incest. "

666,"Tell him to enjoy his mates party,you will be going on the trip by yourself. And if he doesn’t change his plans you should still go. "
667,"Ask family/friends for help, stay with someone else for a while until you get a job... Just don't stay. Don't try to talk to him about breaking up. He will react badly to it and probably make it really hard to leave. If he threatens you with self-harm, call the police and explain. They will check up on him. You are done here. From this point on it's going to be hard but things will turn for the better because of it. "
668,"What?  Ok, that was really relevant and you avoided answering it for a long time!!

He confessed he forgot about a party, he asked you if rescheduling was possible, you said it would cost money and be a pain, so he agreed to still go on the trip.  HE WAS GOOD WITH IT.  All he did was ask a question about the possibility of rescheduling.

I seriously think you are really really overreacting to this.  People forget things, it happens, it doesn't mean he doesn't care about you."

670,Women...
671,"OK, well, it's been a year and you're not happy with him, you find he doesn't support you emotionally, you feel left out of his life, and you say he has a low EQ...so if you are not happy, break up.
"
672,"Sometimes people don’t realise what’s ‘normal’ to them isn’t actually normal. He’s probably struggling with that now.

Also, a lot of people don’t really get what emotional incest is - that it’s not sexual. Look up Kati Morton on YouTube and maybe show him her video on emotional incest? She’s a licensed therapist who does YouTube videos and she’s really great."
673,"After I told him it would be difficult to reschedule or cancel, he said we would still go on this trip. 

But I felt like my moo is totally ruined. "
674,"OK so people are being reaaaaal snappy with you in these comments and although I agree with them to an extent, I also empathize with you and your situation. At 21 I was still in college, had just gotten my first credit card so I had no credit either, and my family was taking care of my rent in exchange for me taking full classes and getting good grades. I completely understand why you're freaking out right now. 

&gt; I'm just so stressed out and just want my boyfriend and I to live ALONE. AND BE ALONE. 

Now here's me being real with you: you probably won't have this. I'm on year 2 living with my partner and other roommates in a big house. We love our roommates, but man it would be nice to afford a studio. We make more than you do but we also live in SF so it's literally impossible to afford a studio because (usually) living in a studio is the most pricey. With your current income plus whatever your boyfriend can eventually get (and yes, he needs to do SOMETHING. Work at a restaurant or Trader Joes part time at the very freaking least), you should stick to roommates for awhile. It will give you more of an opportunity to save. And I know it's hard to see now, but it's actually possible to have GOOD ROOMMATES (it takes luck though tbh). 

What you need to do immediately: bf needs to suck it up and get some kind of income. You should start researching how to build credit (getting a card isn't a bad idea). And, I'd start trying to save as much as you can while looking up housing posts online. I found my house through a local private facebook group. See what you can find online and start looking for places with master bedrooms available (perfect setup for a couple). Good luck and pm me if you wanna chat further. "
675,"HOLY FUCK THIS IS NOT NORMAL. You need to call a women's shelter, a relative, ANYONE. GTFO of there. I'm almost 32 and have never seen a guy do that in my whole life. Next time he threatens suicide, CALL 911."
676,"I’ve talked to him about this for many years because I’m always worried he secretly is not okay with it, but he always reassured me. I just feel awful for not being one of those gfs that have sex with their partner everyday or even weekly. I feel like I’m one of the only 22 year olds out there with a significant other that averages 5 times a month. "
677,Then go on the trip alone and spend the time thinking about whether he is a net positive or a net negative in your life.
678,Let him leave. Let him cry. This is abuse. Eviction takes time and even if you're not on the lease if you can prove you live there a landlord has to evict you the regular way. Source: am landlord and only allow tenants to host guests for 3 weeks at a time due to this loophole.
679,"&gt;Perhaps you could plan to cook her dinner and then go out after, like to see a movie in theaters. 

That's a great idea. If things are going well, you can skip the movie and stay home. But at least, if you phrase the invite this way, you're making clear that sex is not a hard expectation.  "
680,"No.  They can’t.  Trust your gut.  There’s no such thing as a truly platonic opposite friendship.  But there are appropriate friendships that have strong boundaries.  Your boyfriend clearly doesn’t grasp that concept.  And trust me, even if this doesn’t end up being a problem with her - it’s just going to be a problem with another girl in the future.  Like what’s next, he’s going to start going on one on one ~~dates~~hangouts with other girls? Or “I only accepted her number at the bar bc I wanted to be friends” RUN.  He’s showing you who he is 6 months in.  Believe him.  "

682,I kind of already did right here didn’t I? and he was very cold and casual about it. Again I didn’t want to tell him I wanted him when he was being so casual about it and acting cold 
683,"I understand that now but he just wasn't seeming to understand how serious the situation is. I gave him examples of why I think that it is emotional incest and explain to him what it means. I explained to him that it doesn't have anything to do with sexual contact, but that when boundaries are crossed in to an unhealthy area. In other words the sibling uses there are their sibling as a replacement for a partner."
684,How did you meet? Why would he start dating someone new when his life was this complicated? 
685,Your anxiety will stop when you leave him - I promise you this. And then after you will feel stronger as well. You just need to leave him though- he bringing the worst in yourself and you becoming insecure and feeling helpless . This is what he wants you to be. You feel like anxious as you on a rollercoaster for his needs and wants all the time and not thinking for yourself . Honestly move on with your family. Don’t contact him - sort yourself out first. I tell you in one year you be stronger again - promise 
686,Incest is gross. 
687,"There are tons of terms you could have used that would describe this that would make it seen far less extreme.

"
688,I have a line I wont cross. 
689,"You absolutely won’t be abandoning them. You’ll be giving them a lifeline. You staying in that house doesn’t do a damn thing but ensure that *three* of you will be miserable. 

Move in with your uncle. Or get a cheap place with roommates. Anywhere your brothers could come visit you when shit at home gets overwhelming. Having a sibling who made it out will grease the path for *them* to get out too, when they’re old enough. 

Someone has to be the first to brave mom’s wrath, and since life’s unfair like that, it usually falls to the eldest child. Show them you can piss off mom and survive just fine. "
690,I don't know what to think about her using. Maybe I'm in denial. Not sure how much longer I can deal with it. She says she's not using and I believe her. 
691,"Call his bluff, I guarantee he's doing this so you'll beg for him back."
692,I’m pumped after reading this!
693,That's really sad. Good luck in the future. 
694,"If you've broken up repeatedly, yes, I think you should just break up and go on the trip alone."
695,"I spent many years in food service.  It's extremely difficult work and notorious for having crazy coworkers.  I saw many a fresh faced culinary school graduate get beaten down and dissatisfied.  

Not be a jerk, but if she thinks being a sous chef or chef is easier than being a prep cook she's in for a rude awakening.  It will mean longer hours and more responsibility.  The pay will increase but it will not be easier work.

However there are options:

1) Find a different place to be a prep cook.  She might like it more with a different group of coworkers/different management.

2) Get a job at a nursing home, frat/sorority, university or other institution.  Those are the cushy jobs with benefits and regular hours.

3) Suck it up and leave the industry.  "
696,"There are two types of ""love"" passionate and compassionate. They come in stages the former usually lasts for about a year and this is what you are experiencing. In my experience, your relationship can go a few ways you can form a dependency on each other where you must see each other every day or it can turn into something where you can go a while without talking. When you are in a relationship that you must see each other or must constantly talk to each other your fights will hurt significantly more and could lead to a rocky relationship. "
697,She's a thief. She's irredeemable imo. How can you ever trust her again? She'll pay you back? When? What if that was money you had needed immediately? Nope. Let her go.
698,That's a pretty understandable reason to pursue the new job/be excited
699,"You invite a guy over to your apartment that you met on an “app” (probably tinder) and you’re mad he made a move? Do you expect him to pull out a contract of consent and ask you to sign it before he moves his hand while making out with you? 

He respected your wishes and agreed. Wtf more do you want "
700,"He broke up with you so you currently are not in a relationship. If sleeping with another guy while you aren't in a relationship with your ex is something your ex would later bring up as a reason not to get back together, he isn't someone you should be with anyway. A random fling, a crush that makes you feel like a teenager again. This is how people recover from break ups and the best and fastest way to make the pain to away a little. You should be prioritizing getting over him and your own mental and emotional health before the possible future concerns of a man who left you. "
701,I’d rather not “test her”. I don’t want her to throw it away for me. She’s very sentimental so I think she would have a hard time with it considering she won’t even toss a ragged stuffed animal collection. I just wanted to know if it was normal to have an “ex box” as someone put it.

704,"Hmmmm. This may be a tougher experience than you think. This is still a relatively new break up. This very well could be painful. I'd almost recommend not going. Do you think you'll be alright seeing her in someone else's arms. If no, then you probably shouldn't go. Why make this tougher on yourself. At the end of the day your gonna choose what ya choose to do. But I'd hate to know your making yourself suffer. It takes time getting over a relationship - months, sometimes a full year to be honest. It's like any other grieving process. "
705,"If they sees redeeming qualities in him enough to have gotten this far maybe just sending him away wouldn't be the best idea. Then he'll go on about life with out having really learned anything or how to change, as well as now being more bitter, frustrated, and confused. I find in these situations to address them as they come up, and ask questions. If he has a problem with her being there, ask why. Get him to explain it so either he can realize he has no reason and he's being rude, or you'll have at least found out the motive and what can really be done. Then it's a matter of setting boundaries. At least that way even with a separation the lesson has been learned. Or do you think it's better to just establish a line then turn someone away"
706,"If it’s that much of a problem for you then absolutely bring it up with her. Not in an accusatory way, but in a way that will help her feel comfortable to explain herself and for you to understand without judgement. If you really want to move forward with her then you need to approach this as a team rather than you versus her. If you’re not satisfied with how this goes and you’re sure you’ve done everything in your power to make your relationship better, then consider time apart. Best of luck"
707,When me and my SO first got together we texted all day everyday. I mean unless we were at work or busy but it wad pretty constant. He would call me when he got off work and I never saw a problem with any of that. We've been together for almost 2 years now. 
708,That's creepy dude. You need to move on like yesterday. 
709,"Well, we didnt discuss about going somewhere overnight until last weekend, that was when I started looking for accomodation and took about 3 days to finalize everything and confirm with him too. 

I got really frustrated as well as he didnt even invite me to this party. "
710,"Just go for it man. Its scary and hard as hell to do that stuff but it's worth it. Go up and be like ""hey you're cool and we should talk more, can I have your number?""

Women really like confidence."
711,"""Emotional incest"" is a psychological term used by people with psychology degrees. OP didn't just make it up and she didn't just find it on a blog post, either.

If you'd like to educate yourself on the topic, you can find plenty of reliable resources online."
712,Sam is a douche. Sam shouldn’t be allowed in YOUR home. Boyfriend needs to put the foot down and put you first. 
713,"Most people (not just guys) are going to figure that being taken to their Tinder match's home will lead to sex, and if it's then followed by making out, they'll be pretty confident they're going to have sex.

So if what put you off is just the fact that he made a move, then you are setting yourself up for pain until you either a) don't go to either of your homes with your date until you're ready for sex or b) be super clear that sex is not on the table. Preferably the former, because of course then this person you don't trust yet doesn't know where you live. 

On the other hand, if he wouldn't take no for an answer, threw a tantrum, pressured you, or did any other fucked up shit, then yes, *get away from the dude who does not care about your consent.*

No matter what, though, if you don't want to see him anymore, then don't. You don't have to prove your case beyond a reasonable doubt. You don't owe him anything. But please, in the future, go on dates outside until you're ready. "
714,"It sounds like Sam is hurting, and there's a bunch of good stuff that you don't have time to unpack in your post because of how not great he is when he's drinking.

Alcoholism can be difficult to talk about.

My advice would be to record how he behaves when he's drunk, and do this for at least 7 or so visits. Get him on audio and video, and then invite just him over so that you and your boyfriend together can talk to him about how his drinking is blinding him to how he's being a shitty friend and making you not feel welcome in your home.

When -not if- he gets defensive about this conversation, show him the first video.

Wait for him to say, ""Ok, that one time I was an ass..."" and  then show him the second. Ask him if he would like you to show him another, and another.

Don't blame him, but instead ask him, ""Can you see how this behavior isn't fair to me? How it would make me feel bad simply for wanting to be comfortable in my own home?

My guess is Sam is seeing everyone drift away from him, and he's clinging to the old days. 

It would be great if your boyfriend and his friends started a boy's night... But somewhere else. They deserve some time alone, just with each other, because that's what old friends do.

Nothing wrong with that, and your boyfriend might need to be encouraged to do that. For his own sake. Getting older can be rather lonely, because you lose precious people along the way."
715,"Not everyone can do a FWB thing; your feelings don’t always understand that it’s casual. If jealousy is getting to you, then either see if he’s up for more or move on :(

Do you try to date other people? That might help. "

717,"Oh you are the sweetheart 😢 I will try as soon as he gets back from work... From what I experienced, he reacts really bad as soon as this kind of topics pop up. But I will ask him very calmly, nicely and with comprehension, I really want to know and make sure he’s as sweet and genuine as he promises me to be~"
718,"So at the point where you were hoping he'd pick you something up, I think it would have been 100% reasonable to ask him to handle dinner for tonight if you were feeling bad and not up to making your own dinner, but that's not what you did. You just sat back and assumed *he would assume* you would want him to do it, and then got upset when he didn't assume right. 

IMO expecting people to be mind readers and anticipate your needs is highly overrated, and communicating your needs so people have a fair shot at meeting them is highly underrated. "
719,You owe her nothing. Make the best decision for yourself; your heart and body and is telling you something is not right and it may never be. Follow your instincts not your fears.
720,She’s lying and snap chatting guys she fucked in the past. She doesn’t care about your boundaries in a relationship. Why are you even with her? Ditch her and have a better life. 
721,"If she hadn’t wanted intimacy for 3 weeks, but say M knew she cheated , why would she punch him one week ago knowing he could expose her? It just sounds like she knows some immature people. Also antibiotics can really fuck up your vaginal environment which can cause BV or yeast, both of which can irritate the tissue and make sex painful. Personally my PH is really volatile and while I had BV , fingers didn’t hurt but actual sex did. Additionally, I went through periods of time where I had high sex drive, and then low low. My boyfriend also accused me of cheating when I refused sex, which didn’t feel good. They’re not vending machines with a finite amount of sex to give out. 

If you don’t have proof she cheated on you then don’t do anything. Just make sure you’re being safe and recommend her to a gyno if she really is having pain. BV and yeast infections don’t just go away, and many women can experience recurring infection if left untreated. Also men can get yeast infections from women so yes be careful. "
722,It is a really good book and appropriate here.
723,"Sam is an asshole and your husband should not allow him back.

Let your husband deal with it, it's his friend.

But can't you at least give the guys a proper guys night once a fortnight or once a month?

There might be things they want to discuss that they can't with you there about various issues.

Like yes it's your home but you are capable of compromise in this situation too.

Can't you hang out a friend's house, join a Meetup, watch a movie etc one or two nights a month?"
724,"This is definitely another possibility. I switched from cigs to vaping, and I’ll be honest I enjoyed smoking. The action of it. I’m weening myself off the nicotine itself until I get down to nothing and as it stands now I may still continue even when I get down to zero. "
725,Throw the whole boyfriend away because his parents have been acting like this towards you for years and he hasn't opened his mouth to defend you &amp; continues to subject you to this behavior. 
726,"He’s 33 and pulling this childish, abusive shit? Get out of there. "
727,He also waited for a month and a half and OP to confess her feelings before he told her. It's not like he didn't know he was going to be a father soon.
728,"Dude, she sounds unstable. I know it is easier said than done but focus on yourself and try not to obsess over her, you have no idea what she is going to say and do when she gets back. In the meantime, get your citizenship sorted and build your life as you see fit. Set yourself up for success rather than stuck in a passive cycle. Who knows if she'll come back to you and want to be with and who knows what damage she has done. You may not want her back. Build your life... today is day one of your future. You can have a great one without her."
729,"i'd really rather avoid conflict if i can, especially if i'm going to be living with her! but thank you for the advice, i'll definitely keep this sort of response in mind should she turn more hostile. "
730,"My heart goes out to you. There is no pain like death. If I can say anythint...take care of you. Be the best friend you can be to you. Tough day? Find ways to comfort yourself. Having a good idea of coping mechanisms (healthy ones) is a game changer. For me, I journal in the am- usually one or two sentences. Date/mood/problem or success. It puts things in perspective if you do it over time. I can look back and see like DAMN, I have grown as a person and I can honestly say I’m better now than I was four years ago, two years ago, shit even last year. I do not overextend myself the way I did before. I’m good with saying “no thank you tho” where before I struggled to say no and when I did, I added all the reasons to say no. Now I say no and it is what it is. 
If you treat yourself as #1, take care of yourself as you would a child (ample sleep, good food, physical activity, enjoyable hobbies, kind friends, enjoyable work) the bumps in life get easier to deal with. I’m not suggesting all those things happen at the same time or even as a group- but by saying hmmm is this working for me? Does this feel good? Or does my gut say no—-that’s being self aware and taking care of YOU. There are days where warm cuddly socks and a soft robe make everything better. Then there are days where you feel invincible. Just start asking yourself how you are doing and how you feel. It’s weird at first. But after awhile..it feels weird not to! Give you the best you by taking care of you and loving yourself for you- blemishes and all. I know my faults- I’ve got a lot to work on. But I’m not striving for perfect and neither should anyone. Just try and enjoy the journey and have a game plan for dealing with bullshit when it gets thrown at you. Cus bullshit happens on a daily and we all have a choice on how to deal with it and much we allow it to affect ourselves. Hugs. "
731,"Can you order a cheap camera on amazon, they have outside ones or doorbell cameras (if your mailbox is in view) then if he does it again maybe she’ll feel more confident with proof "
732,"It sucks when a parent isn't the kind of person you want them to be. If you're not willing to go no contact, I would implement some serious boundaries with her and put her on an information diet.  As much as you may be inclined to share certain information with her, she has shown that her reaction isn't going to what you hope it would. If I had to guess, i'd also say she has targeted you as her own kind of scapegoat. It seems like she takes out her anger/frustrations about other issues in her life and her own shortcomings on you.  "
733,He says it’s because he feels like I’m not ready yet after having our baby to start working. Smh. I’m home with her everyday or with him... I feel so suffocated! I don’t know how to talk to people besides him anymore lol
734,"I know that I should not keep lending them money, but it is very hard to say no for me. I feel very pressured to do things and eventually give in."
735,Why is your boyfriend smoking weed if he has no money? Adult up. There's lots of work out there.
736,Is it really that wrong if we both love each other? I understand everyones going to jump to conclusions but the bond we have is real and I love her so deeply. 
737,"Not sure where OP is from but international women's day can be pretty big outside of the US. When I was growing up, my stepdad always got me and my mom gifts for it. (I think she got jewelry; I got a Green Day CD lol)"
738,"I'm a 20 year old bi girl who has only been with men. Because, legitimately all of the girls I've ever had a crush on or been secretly in love with were straight (this is what happens when you're into fems as a queer woman). I am more than qualified to answer this.

I am still friends with most of the people I've had a crush on, or the people I don't talk to anymore are because they haven't been around since high school. If it's painful to be around her, that's when you have to pull the plug. If you still see her as a friend who you secretly want to hold the hand of or f***, that's ok. But if every time you hangout with her, this stresses you out, or you can't help but think about, or you start to become the embodiment of /r/niceguys or /r/nicegirls, that's when you have to leave.

I hope this helps, OP. "
739,"Much of what you describe is a normal response to emotional abuse. 

"
740,"It sounds like youve been having a really tough time first of all and I'm sorry you have been so miserable.

Reading your post I get the sense that you didn't really get the chance to get to know each other in person before you started dating so you are just now starting tk notice major red flags that you may have noticed earlier had you spent more time together in person.

Based on how you're feeling lately, despite his efforts to ""work on things"" it seems like you've come to the conclusion internally that you're not super compatible, and therefore you feel guilty.

But there's nothing wrong with being incompatible with someone. Sometimes that's just the way it is. And a breakup sucks big time but it's worth your happiness long term.

I also wanted to point out that his point about ""being together for two years"" is a little bit of a sunk cost fallacy. Just because you have been together for two years doesn't automatically mean you should put up with whatever because you already put that time in. "
741,"Tell ""Sam"" to suck off "
742,"Ya I think you already know the answer, sry bud:/ regardless unless she can prove 100% that she didn't cheat (which idk how she would) the trust is broken."

744,This story makes no sense. Or the poster is leaving out huge chunks of information. How do people that have been friends for 10+years not know what each others interests are till some random dinner?? 
745,"No, not summer camp. It’s a family attraction that runs for a month and a half in the fall. People of all ages work there. "
746,He may be 😂
747,I feel like a mess :( 
748,"Yes because she's probably obsessed with you, which is not healthy in any way."
749,Well that is very manipulative of him. He can blame you all he wants - and yes that is galling and crazy-making -- but you have to keep firm on your boundaries and do what is right for you. 
750,"He says he ""ran it by"" his girlfriend before his friend stayed.  Does ""ran it by"" mean *asked* or *told*?  And was his friend a stranger to her?"
751,Oh I absolutely agree with that. So we agree. I was just trying to give a little taste of the other side since I am in a similar boat and know the feeling. 
752,"Respect their wishes. That’s what a gentleman would do. A gentleman doesn’t keep trying to have sex and ignore her family. 

Relax. Let her contact you. Figure it out from there.

"
753,"Yeah I immediately regretted writing that because it isn’t really fair or reasonable- but if the end goal was to see if she was over him that would tell you- but as I said, her not being over it has zero to do with you and her relationship and isn’t any indication of how much she loves you or how much you mean to her, etc."
754,"Neither of you is in the position right now to be a friend to the other. Especially with surrounding mental health issues. In fact you're probably making it more complicated by remaining in each others' lives instead of taking time to process, grieve, and find a new normal in your post-relationship lives."
755,Say Thanks and move on. You don't need to do anything. Hopefully it feels good that someone overcame awkwardness and past issues to express sympathy to you.
756,"Just go for interviews , the more you go the better practice you get! If you don’t get the position as for feedback from the company and it’ll help you teach yourself and eventually you’ll find something, just keep trying , don’t give up before you’ve started. Push forward and do everything you can to be successful. You can do it! "
757,"Best case scinerio: You met on an app that is also used for hookups. You said you were not looking for a serious relationship. That you wanted something casual. Which means a fling/hookup. Went on two dates and invited him over to yours. He reads you wrong. You tell him to stop. He does immediately. Feels bad for reading you wrong. Realises he likes you enough he’s wanting to see where this goes, even though he wasn’t thinking much about getting into a long term relationship either. 

Worst case scinerio: All of the above except the last sentence changes slightly. He thinks you are looking for a boyfriend and he doesn’t know you well enough to decide if he wants to enter into a relationship with you yet, but he’s willing to find out. "
758,"Break up, get tested. "
759,You can’t really plan how things are going to go. When I was in high school I dated a guy that was a year older. We agreed we’d break up before he goes away to uni and did so. But we were both miserable to start the new year. We ended up getting back together about a month in then breaking up again two months later. You can try breaking up at the start of summer but chances are when you get there if the relationship is going well you don’t want to.
760,"Oh honey, interviews are easy, once they invite you to come in you know they *want* to want you. 

Remember if you get called in for an interview it’s because they see great value in you."
761,It's like a bandaid... Just rip it off and you can start healing and focusing on what's important... Good luck :)
762,"Not trying to say it's abandoning them or make you feel worse if you leave. I still agree what's best for you and your future goals should come first. But I understand the pressure the oldest siblings feel sometimes. If you're close to them I would just suggest making sure that they know that even if you leave, your still there for them. Especially if they don't have the option to leave too. I agree with everyone that if you decide it's best to go, then go "
763,Depends on what you want. It's a sign she's not going to be your wife. Many relationships don't become marriages
764,You can't help what you feel but you can still control your actions towards those feelings. In this case the only appropriate thing to do with these feelings is ignore them. 
765,He’s 33 and acting like a manipulative child. Tell him he knows where the knives are and walk out. 
766,"Her mother sounds like somebody with serious emotional problems and boundary issues, or she wouldn’t be going after her daughter’s husband. This is screaming dysfunction to me, and suggests some possible reasons why your wife is so fucked up to begin with."
767,I'd hesitate to do it because my partner was demanding I throw out my stuff instead of talking about his insecurities like an adult. 
768,"I don't really understand what kind of closure you're hoping to get here and, thus, I don't really see a point in reaching out to him. If you just want him to know the pets you used to share are still doing well, this could probably be achieved by just putting pictures of them up on a social media platform that he, presumably, can see since you can see his. If he's interested or wondering, he'll see it now or if he chooses to check your profile in the future. Otherwise, it just seems like you're inviting a complicated and potentially unpleasant situation for both of you, without clear benefit. "
769,"That's a lot of specific conversations for 6 weeks centred around children, where he could have told you but he didn't 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩"
770,"He is clearly cheating, and you seem to be in a little bit of denial about it. "
771,"Ok this info definitely helps. Having a kid does definitely change the way you live your life (I am a parent). It’s completely ok to be selfish about that.

If you know you don’t want to deal with any of that yet, then yes ending things is the best idea. If you are wondering if there is some other way around this by reaching some sort of compromise that is likely possible but would probably only last a couple years. The baby will likely mostly be with mom the first 6 months. There is likely going to be some sort of custody arrangement where he will have at least half the week kid free. It’s possible to carry on for probably two years or so without being affected much aside from not seeing each other as often as you do now, but that will change once they really start become little humans. "
772,"Would you be interested in rekindling your relationship? If not, possibly a cruelty."
773,Not going to comment on whether or not she’s cheating but worth bearing in mind that antibiotics can cause thrush which makes sex REALLY painful so she might have that going on.
774,My life would honestly end. This is scaring me honestly. I never really thought that he would actually do that. He doesn't seem like the type. I don't know.
775,"Yeah dude, run. That's entirely too much too quickly, I'm surprised you've stuck around this long. I'm betting she'll be hard to shake off given her extreme neediness/possible mental illness, but you might as well start trying. When you do, I suggest blocking all weird numbers that call you and ignore her completely. I hope she doesn't know where you live or work....

&amp;#x200B;"
776,Kayaking is fun...but two separate kayaks...tandem kayaks cause divorce.
777,"Yes, but this ex is purposely excluding his current GF.  Friends don’t ask their friends to exclude their SO.  "
778,"On the other hand, you could test this with her- if my hubby cared and cake to me and told me to throw something away from the box- I’d do it because I really don’t care about the guy(s) anymore. I wouldn’t throw EVERYTHING away but I wouldn’t feel an attachment to just one random thing. You could see how she reacts if you ask her to throw away that men’s button up. I’d say it was a red flag if she gets torn up about it. "
779,Get used to it if you plan to stay with him.
780,"Yes. They can just be two people who get along and enjoy each other's company regardless of gender.

It's okay for you to be upset but you have to recognize it's not really his fault and I'd say it'd be unfair to take it out on him or break up or anything like that. But you don't have to sacrifice your happiness in order to be ""fair""."
781,"I only read the first couple of points because if someone had told me all of those things less than 3 months into knowing them/being in a relationship with them, I would run for the hills."
782,"Reach out once, if it doesn't go well move on. Also dont assume she misses you because she unblocked you"
783,"I agree. Is there a way you would suggest approaching him without implying that he is an inappropriate or bad person? I say that because while he has said very inappropriate and unacceptable things, I feel like that's not typical of who he really is. I think he's not self-aware, or has anxiety?"
784,"One of the best things I ever heard from someone, if there’s a small leak in your house and it’s a few drips and drops you’ll usually ignore it. It’s nothing too big. Time passes by and this ‘dripping’ has turned into a full scale leakage. More time passes and eventually, the leak is out of control, there’s water everywhere and there is no fixing it. Too much damage is done. This is your relationship. Your self esteem, confidence and mental health will suffer. Get outta there and seek the right support you need for the benefit of you and your child. This relationship will only get worse, trust me. "
785,"I understand that perspective, but if were really that terrible she would have left. She seemed to agree with the arangment and is fine with it. I'm not forcing her to be here, especially if im such a terrible BF"
786,"I know this is hard, but try and save all your animosity for the adults in this situation. Neither you, your brothers nor this guy’s kid got ANY SAY in who their parents are. Take your uncle up on his offer to move in and always keep the lines of communication open with your brothers. You are 20 and have the option of independence, they don’t. 

When your mom talks to you, keep everything matter of fact and don’t indulge her foray into emotional manipulation.

You simply say “You’ve made your choice, I’ve made mine.” Now is not the time to tell her how shitty she is...she obviously doesn’t care. "
787,"They are both the real her. Nobody is all bad and nobody is all wonderful.

The question is, even if she is the wonderful person some of the time, do you really want to be with someone who is willing to make you her back up guy?

Everyone deserves to have someone who wants them; she wants you as a backup option if her ""better"" options don't work out.

Be brave and break all contact, my dude. You deserve so much better than how she's treating you."
788,"You *should* be ashamed of these thoughts, which is why you must keep them to yourself and not express them to your son."
789,"I totally agree, it's very inappropriate behavior, and frankly it's disgusting. I don't know how to approach this conversation though. He may have said these gross things, but I absolutely promise that he isn't this crude when we're alone or with mutual friends. I want to point out to him that he's saying and doing inappropriate things, without making him feel like that is a true representation of who he is."
790,"I definitely agree with you there. I thought about it more and realized I made a mistake not telling him beforehand. 

My boyfriend doesn't drink but I'll have to come up with a similar compromise. I'm also having issues figuring out how to bring him to meet some of my other friends. The 2 friends I have right now are not the ""hang out and do nothing"" friendship yet. So I find myself going out to drinks with them a lot more in a mid-20s type of way. And he's talked to me before about how since he's quit drinking, it isn't as fun in that type of social setting. Since it's such an early relationship, I haven't made that effort mostly because I'm still trying to figure out my place in our relationship as well as in my new friendships. 

I'll bring it up to him regardless and offer a similar compromise. "
791,This is the best thing I've read all day. Keep kicking ass both of ya!
792,"Yes, I think it's concerning as well. I'm definitely going to approach him about this, but I'm going to assume positive intent -- not that he meant well by saying inappropriate things, but that he didn't have negative intent behind it.


Your situation sounds very much like what he might be going through. It's really disappointing that he's older than I am and I have to have this conversation with him, but he's an otherwise good person, and I know your friend thought the same and wants the best for you as well. "
793,"You’re so right, it should be known that they are both uncomfortable and dislike it. Him makin it about OP does actually throw her under the bus as to being “the problem”. That’s only going to resort to a whole other issue. "
794,"I'm gonna go out on a limb and say...you might have built a thing with Ryan in your head that doesn't actually exist. Having a ""work husband"" ie a close friend of the opposite sex at work is very common. But you seem to have built up this huge unrequited love situation in your head. If Ryan wanted to be with you he would. But he's not. He's with Marissa. PLEASE don't torture yourself thinking about your connection and what could be. You don't know anything about his relationship with Marissa by your own admission because he is respectful and not discussing a private relationship with a coworker. This doesn't mean he wants to be with you. 

I really think you need to quietly distance yourself to get perspective. He is not in love with you he is a coworker friend. Stop texting him after work, don't eat with him everyday, try to limit convo to polite work personal talk (dogs, weekend plans, vacation etc) he doesn't need to know of your deep personal problems. From an outsider perspective you are the inappropriate interloper in a private relationship. Just back off. If Ryan wants more he will break up with Marissa and ask you out."
795,Ask him about it and if he gets upset then dump him... If you two can talk about it and get past it then it’ll be better for both of you. 
796,"Ok I just read this. I mentioned a few toxic behaviors above; edit that to many. Physical violence is never okay :( I'm glad for you that he has gotten past that......  

I hope you find the answers you're looking for and are able to find peace and joy with someone you love. It would be nice if your current bf could be that man. He could do it, too, if he really, *really* made the effort... I suppose you might know if he'd do that better than any of us strangers on here "
797,Stop living with him. Stop dating him. This isn't a relationship any more. 
798,"Honestly if it’s between loans and sanity, chose loans. When you look back on this, you’ll wonder why you stayed for so long.

A lot of people have school debt. It’s not a big deal and it pays off in the long run, trust. Staying at home in a shitty environment is not worth it. And if the bulk of the care goes to you when he moves in, how would you manage school anyways? Get a job on campus, take some money, anything. Do not sacrifice your wellbeing to avoid a little bit of debt."
799,Yeah just be open and talk about it to find where you guys stand and the boundaries you both can set for each other. Doesn’t sound like he should be to upset about it. And this can be an easy hurtle to get over. 
800,"I mean, you're both married and she was throwing herself at you to have a good time. But then again, you're not the legal age to drink, which may be why you felt uneasy about the entire situation. Try not to make her feel bad for the attempt though when she comes to!"
801,You can't take 3rd place in your marriage of two. 
802,"Sam might say he doesn’t remember it, so it doesn’t count. 

BF needs to remind him that it doesn’t matter if he remembers it, what matters is it did happen and he will not tolerate OP being talked to like that!"
803,"Not really, almost no one I know has kids, and maybe only a fourth of people are married.

&amp;#x200B;

I have problem meeting single people, and no issues getting people to agree to hang out, it's just keeping friends that I can't seem to do."
804,"I wonder if maybe it's some form of embarrassment or social anxiety that keeps him from asking you to repeat yourself? May even have a hearing problem that he is either trying to hide or in denial about. 
But still, I'd talk to him, in a non-accusatory way, to try to find out what's behind it"
805,"Sounds like he purposely isolated you so that you can depend on him, OP if you’ve been on your own before you can definitely do it again. I think setting up goals to get out from your relationship will help you through this process, as others have said reach out to your support system for further assistance. Good luck"
806,How long it took to heal the wound? And did you hurt as much as the first time when he dumped you again?
807,"Fair enough, I trust that working on it means some sort of counseling because that sounds more like a phobia than a fear.   Mastering that phobia and gaining that feeling of independence will likely go a long way in helping you develop the ability to say no when you need to say no."
808,I guess its very hard to abandon hope.
809,"I guess you're right but even if Im acknowledging it, Im not able to accept it :("
810,"You didn't take control of shit - your wife's MIL manipulated the whole situation to get what she wanted - she's the one with the control. Whether that was to give you head or just really stick it to your wife for some narcissistic or other dysfunctional reason IDK, but I'm guessing 100% the latter."

812,"My sounds like yours. I eventually wrote her an email telling her that I don't want to see her for a little bit and email works best. I told her it made me feel gross the way she always talked bad about other members of the family. I haven't spoken with her sense. Apparently that one simple boundary was worth losing her child over. Two beneficial things happen, 1. I feel better about myself even if it is tinged with guilt sometimes and 2. I've gotten more insight into her character and how I was raised. If she acts like this as an adult, then she was probably twice as bad when I was a child. So I appreciate gaining that wisdom because I was in the fog for most of my life. It wasn't until I went to therapy that I realized that maybe it was my family wasn't as good to me as I pretended or wanted them to be. "
813,"I mean, I hate LD too and I would never have chosen it as a first-choice option, but I love my bf more than I dislike LDRs, so we're doing it. Over 2k miles for maybe 5 years. It's hard at times, but we see each other as often as we can, and there is no risk of us resenting one another later in life because we didn't do what was best for our careers.

I think at this point, with the uncertainty about her future, you should make decisions based on what you want for your future and you can figure other parts out after. If your relationship is strong enough, you can survive LDR.

Also, her first choice is only 1 hour away, and some would say it's a stretch to even call that LD."

821,"Leagues aren't real. Different people are attracted to and interested in different things. And good news: sounds like you're interested in each other. Which brings me to the even better news: you're already doing it right! Just be yourself and treat her like a person. You can get to know her how you get to know any friend, and see if you two have shared interests and chemistry. If you're worried one-on-one time would be awkward or too much pressure, arrange with your mutual friend to meet again in a group setting first and go from there. "
822,"Asking him out for a beer. While out discuss how you want to be close like you two were once before. Extended an invitation to work things out. 

If he ditches again, don’t hold it against him but move on. Your hurt from his lack of communication and from him not inviting you over. 

Life is to short to hold grudges.

824,"You don’t have a parents problem, you have a fiancée problem. If she set firm boundaries and stood up to them, they wouldn’t treat you as a second-class citizen. They might still grumble to themselves and remain bigoted, but if they were risking losing a close relationship with their daughter by alienating you, there’s a good chance they would tone down their behaviour. 

If she keeps on allowing them to mistreat you, don’t marry her. She is not going to make a good spouse if she doesn’t have your back. Maybe you should show her this thread. "
825,"The bare minimum level of interest is ""wants to be with you"" - romantically. He doesn't. He said so. Respect that. And respect yourself, you deserve far more than that minimum, and you're settling for less than that. 
Only treat him like a coworker. If he gets pissy, tell him. Your friendship got inappropriate. He needs to go to his girlfriend for emotional support. You want his relationship to succeed, because you want him to be happy, so you're stopping away. Only if he asks."
826,"I do agree with the first person. Show him that you understand he's shy and it's totally okay to be shy. Try to do most of the talking while including him in conversational topics. Start topics on things he may like to talk about so he has some input to try and break the ice a bit easier. I think once he feels a bit more comfortable around them he'll come out of his shell. I used to be extremely soft spoken and sort of a low self esteem which caused me to be shy. (Not saying that's how he is at all, it's just something I can sort of relate to)"
827,"I know that I shouldn't get back with him, but it's kinda easier said than done. 4 years is a long time and too much memories to move ahead without looking back. I'm so weak and stupid in love, I need more time to calm down."

830,"Thank you, I already texted my boss that I wouldn't be in tomorrow so I can have the day with her so I'll make time to talk with her. It just bums me out that she hasn't said much about it at all, I thought we were happy. It's only been a month. "
831,"The half of marriages stat is bullshit. Some people get married once, some get married 4 or more times.

That said, it’s still a very good idea to get one. Even if you think you’ll never need it. Marriage is a strange thing these days. Some people even have marriage contracts as weird as it sounds. Most importantly, you need to talk with him about it. This isn’t something you drop on someone when it’s ready to be signed."

834,"Following up on how crazy women’s reproductive health is—my boyfriend (m19) and I (f19) have had the same issues within the past couple months. I was on a cocktail of different hormonal birth controls, antibiotics, shots, and vitamins that all constantly gave me one infection or another. After finally clearing up the last bit of the yeast infection I had and getting my hormones in check, our sex life was PREMIUM. He describes my look as ‘fuck me’ eyes too and said it was driving him crazy because all he saw was that for a couple weeks. Life was pretty good. 

Until out of nowhere I wouldn’t want sex. My libido is still the same—I know I’m attracted to him—but the want for sex isn’t there as much and it’s mainly because it hurts. He figured it was something along the lines of having feelings for my ex again or I was cheating because I would always turn him down and tell him to play nice. 

For weeks after that we’d try having sex and it would just straight up hurt. Fingers were a little bit better but not as good as him as a whole, and I’d never let him go down on me (self confidence issues hit hard when the sex issues came up). 
Well finally I go to my school physician and he tries to rock my cervix and I was in TERRIBLE pain. The speculum insertion and all was just awful. Come to find out I had untreated PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) for about the same time I was on the previous meds and it was most likely due to them messing with my bacteria and pH! 

Talk to you girlfriend about what’s going on with her reproductive health and see if anything is going on. Ask her if it’s affecting her self confidence and that’s why she isn’t letting you go down on her anymore? With things clearing up between my SO and I, I’m defiantly becoming more open to the idea of oral sex again. See if she asked her doctor about the possibility of PID and if she’d like to set up an appointment to see if that’s the case? I’ve had untreated large ovarian and fallopian cysts before that I had no idea were there for MONTHS until I had to get an ultrasound. 

Who knows, maybe it’s really all just hormonal and maybe her body and both of your minds need a rest and reassurance in knowing that it might be something like that rather than cheating. Always remember good and effective communication is key to a successful conversation and tangible solution! 

Wishing you the best of luck! "
835,If he actually does hurt himself it's not your fault. He is an adult and is in control of his own actions. 
836,"\*sigh\* my ex did this shit for a while and it creeped me tf out. But to his credit, as soon as he saw how horrified I was he realized he had crossed a boundary and maintained it.

I think some moms never learn to set boundaries with their sons and it affects their relationships negatively later.

The biggest thing is just being honest with him. You're uncomfortable, and you have a right to voice anything that makes you uncomfortable and ask that it stops."
837,"Thank you so much for the kind and sympathetic response. I am sorry that you had to go through so much pain.

&gt; wherever you are, you can always go home. Always.

Well .... what started this all was a camping trip. I went with my youth group to a very rural place, hours and hours away from where I lived. I asked my Dad if I could go home and he said no (he was chaperoning). We had no car, just the group's bus. If I ran away, I'd be running away to what, like .... a gas station? Goats on the Roof (weird Georgia attraction)? There was nowhere to go and only one random girl camper even half-cared about me and took care of me once. No phone reception, nothing. Dad could not be in my female cabin either. The adults hardly gave a shit and couldn't comprehend at all how bad this was and only did the bare minimum for me, while other times ignoring or making things worse.

I really, really hate to say it was ""traumatic,"" because I know that I would just get mocked, but .... dear Lord, that was above a 10/10 on the scale of pain. I cry sometimes thinking about it. About how there was no way out, hardly anyone cared, and I couldn't even text my freaking best friend so he could at least try to comfort me. It was beyond hopeless. It's really depressing even thinking about this.

And then, after all of that, my brother (who also has OCD and should have understood more than almost anyone .... ) he knowingly triggers my anxiety almost every night. Every day and night was so much pain. When I brought it up, I was the bad guy for imposing on his gaming at midnight and 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM, so you know, I could take care of myself and do one or two summer math classes and a history class, and just to not feel horrible for once. I eventually moved to my grandparents for 2-3 weeks until he left for university.

I appreciate the thought, but this is something that can't easily be fixed. My brother acts like it is all made-up, and my parents never even punished him, even when he yelled at me unprovoked and made me cry and I cut myself .... they still did nothing.

Now that he has moved out, and I can go to the school near me, I can just stay at home until I get a good job and can move out.

Now that my brother is finally gone, it is not influencing my life much. I was going to have to commute 4 hours a day to a university, but now I don't have to, now that I got the scholarship for the one near me. My sleeping has been great now that he is gone and my parents are working a lot. I have no female friends anymore to have sleepovers with anyway. Giving up travelling I don't really give a shit about because I am not much into travelling at all, except the local timeshares that are in the same state and I have been to a bunch of times.

I don't really have a need to move forward because no one is forcing me to go camping and my brother has left and my life is no longer Hell. Life has been great without him, and after having time to heal from the experiences.

About therapy .... idk if I already said this, but I live in a small town. Not many options at all. Most of the time I was with them was not helpful at all (there were very helpful times, but they were relatively rare).

I really appreciate your care in trying to help me overcome this, but I don't have a want or need to overcome it at this point."
