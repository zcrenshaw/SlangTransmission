0,"Stop paying for him, first of all. And it could be awkward to broach the topic with him, but sometimes adult conversations are awkward but necessarty. ""BF, I've noticed that you don't ever offer to pay for my meals, even though on x occasions I've offered to pay for you and you've accepted. What's up with that?"""
1,It sounds a lot like he keeps telling you that he’s not interested in getting married and you keep not hearing it
2,"She dates married men, tells you how hot she thinks your husband is, says she would bang your husband if she could, then told you that your husband cares more about her than your family. She doesnt sound like a friend at all. She sounds like a desperate insecure middle schooler stuck in an adult womans body. 

She doesnt want your boundaries and has made it clear she will step over them whenever she pleases. Your only choice is to cut contact, or limit contact to only seeing her and talking to her when your family invites her over. "
3,"My sister was like this. She has a habit of wandering about, aimlessly looking through things. I just told her bluntly, ""Hey, could you stop looking through my stuff like that? I'm an adult now, I need some privacy."" She was actually very apologetic. She didn't realize what she was doing and has since stopped completely. There's something to be said for direct communication."
4,"She’s making your feelings seem unreasonable as a manipulation tactic, there’s literally nothing more to it than that. If you can walk away "
5,"She’s nosy, bottom line. Just clearly tell her no. “Please don’t go on our bedroom.” You don’t have to give her any more than that. "
6,"&gt; She said I don't understand engagement and that it's important for a man to surprise a woman. 


Hahaha, your sister is extremely immature and I really hope her bf realises this and doesn't get engaged to her."
7,And this man is still your boyfriend because ...?
8,"Sounds like he was just looking for an excuse to end things.

You're not defective. You're just genetically compelled to do something that a lot of people do as they get older anyway, which is not drink so damned much. I don't think this is about your alcohol consumption anyway, because as you grow and change you'll find a lot more people who will understand your side of things. "
9,"As a (so far) life long gamer, that is married to someone that has an addictive personality that also games. I want to try to put this in a different light than others here.

My wife was just like your husband, and it took counseling for us to change her habits. She knew she was addicted to MMO's, but honestly could never stop. She would put Raiding above our marriage, our son, and responsibilities every time. There was always one more instance to run, or one more guildmate to help get some gear.

Serious discussions wont help here. She had no idea that her addiction was killing our family. 

I gave her one demand, show up on this date at this address for counseling, or I file paperwork, and our kid is coming with me. At the time he was 10, and I had enough info on her habits, spending, and calling in sick to work for ""World Firsts"", that i was pretty confident i would have gotten custody.

**You have to treat this like an addiction, because thats what it is.** 

Anyone that tries to tell you that your husband needs to grow up, or compares him to a teenager is missing the point here. There are enough studies coming out every day that show how games and gambling are related in how they impact your brain and its chemistry.

It took about 12 years of us being together for her to get it, she is now 7 years into not gaming at all. 

I will try to dig up some literature for you on how to handle this and will PM it when I find it.

Good luck, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Just remember the part above that I put in bold"
10,I would ask him why someone would message your sister about it now if it was so long ago because that’s a little weird
11,"He's 35 and his family has essentially kept him isolated with the kind of passive aggressive tactics they used on you.  It's entirely natural that he would mourn their ability to be happy for him.

Let him work on the changing the dynamic with his family as he goes.  He shouldn't cut them out completely, just withdraw a bit.   If he wants to attend a family event, discuss it and decide what's best in the specific situation."
12,"He'll buy gifts for other people, but not for you? The stuff he bought for the friend sounds like it was spontaneous, not for a particular reason, but he won't buy you birthday or holiday presents? Yeah, he's not cheap. He doesn't care that much about you."
13,I'm honestly shocked that it took him getting the dog for you to realize that you're being taken advantage of here. 
14,A one night stand is a mistake. 1.5 years and *in your bed* is intentional. Walk.
15,"honestly, i thought this was going somewhere completely different. it sounds like your feelings in this situation are completely appropriate, so act how you feel! you see your dad’s supportive, helpful significant other as something of a mother figure, because of their relationship &amp; how she’s treated you. i can’t think of a better way for this to go. support your dad however he says he needs support, &amp; do the same for her. congrats on the bonus family❤️"
16,He is wrong and knows it. I think this relationship has run it's course and you need to consider leaving him and his toxic attitude behind. He doesn't respect you. Reach out and go stay with family and friends and have them help you get your stuff and move out. Don't let him continue to emotionally abuse you. 
17,"Timecards from work. 

And then maybe think about cutting this person out of your life. "
18,Here's some advice: Jane is incredibly stupid. Ignore her. 
19,"You need to go to HR immediately Monday morning. Don’t delete the texts, show them to them. Explain what happened and let them handle it."
20,"""I am not going to go through the most important day of my life blind. I am wearing my glasses at my wedding and that is final."""
21,"The secret was ""killing him"" but it took you walking in on him having sex with her for him to admit to it? Riiiight. This guy is not worth your time."
22,"Tell everyone, “Man, I’m so glad to hang out with a friend, so many guys have been hitting on me and it just makes me so uncomfortable, I’m sick of having to tell everyone that I’m not interested in hook ups or dating.”"
23,"I think the dumbest &amp; most mindblowing part of this to me is that OP’s boyfriend found someone (1) willing to date the parent of four kids at various ages / developmental stages, (2) willing to move in together with the parent of four kids &amp; (3) willing to tolerate being the primary caregiver to HIS four children while he completely disengages from being a father. That’s a pretty sweet deal for a guy that can’t be bothered to raise his own children - &amp; he’s risking all of that... for a puppy. Either he’s not thinking clearly (which is a possibility given the car accident &amp; brain injury) or he just thinks that OP is so much of a pushover that he can get away with it. 

OP, make good on your ultimatum &amp; leave. Stay gone, even if he gets rid of the puppy. There is no reason that this needs to be what the rest of your life is like. "
24,"&gt; if you can walk away

I can't, really. Like, my brother told my I could live with him if I wanted to, but even if I did, I don't have a car or a bank account or insurance or anything important without her. Almost everything is in her name. 

And I'm just now realizing as I'm typing this how fucking insane that is. Fuck "
25,Why the hell are you with this guy?
26,"Yes, but better to realise now than in 5 or 10 years. Start opening your own accounts, policies etc etc and make gradual changes until you’re not in a dependent position "
27,"Be blunt. Be direct. When a friend is over, say ""Stop touching me, I don't like that."" Shut down the sexual comments. ""Ew, gross, can we not talk about that?""

With your coworkers, ""I prefer not to talk about that aspect of my life with coworkers, please stop."" You did the right thing by not ""pretending to date"" a friend. Go learn about setting and enforcing healthy boundaries. Don't wait for them to take the hint, be direct."
28,"I've heard that type of thing before, but I'm a family law paralegal and deal with divorce every day. I think it's important to remember that in a relationship, the opposite of love isn't hate. It's apathy. It sounds like your wife ""nothings"" you. It's up to you what to do with the information she's given you. I'd be lining up my ducks- life is too short to spend it with someone who cares more about literally everyone else than me."
29,It's incredibly inappropriate. Get a lock for that door.
30,"Sorry, I can’t get past the fact that a) you have a hot water tank that lasts for two hours and b) this kid (according to your inference) spends a whole two hours wanking. Does he take the iPad in there or something?"
31,"&gt; My husband’s brother and parents have all awknowleged that she is nuts, but have actually suggested that I quit my job to make thing easier because there are other hospitals in town I could work for. 

So it's not just your SIL that is nuts, then. 

&amp;#x200B;"
32,"So happy for you OP! 

Also thanks for sharing to show that what adults should and can do - put effort into making a healthy, sustainable relationship work in the long run. This is especially important considering how many people have been in abusive relationships and don’t realize that yet. "
33,"&gt;  ""it's my best friend"" and she ""doesn't want to choose sides"".

If my best friend started dating a *child*, I'd sure as hell be choosing sides and it wouldn't be hers. 

She doesn't seem to understand that supporting someone doesn't mean agreeing with their bad choices.

I mean, do you live in Crazyland? Why do none of these people see anything wrong with a 20 year old dating a 15 year old...? How can anyone hang out with a friend that's dating a *kid*? This is so incredibly strange to me.

It really, really bothers me when people don't view boys as victims like they do girls when it comes to situations like this. 

Personally, I would tell my girlfriend and friend group that you find her dating a child absolutely wrong and you will not at this time hang out with anyone who supports her. Maybe it sounds extreme but we're talking about a kid here - I do not have time or space for people who view that as 'okay' in my life."
34,"As a gamer myself, with a partner that is also a gamer, I always say that gaming is just like any other hobby. It is something you do **in your free time,** not when you're supposed to be helping around the house, not when you're supposed to be hanging out with your SO, and definitely not the whole damn day. 

I think it would help if you two scheduled date nights. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, it can be just the two of you talking, hanging out, whatever. If he can't respect that, then it's either therapy or you need to pack up your things and go. Cause right now you don't have a husband, you have a very shitty roommate. "
35,You're 20. Why are you letting your parents dictate who you date?
36,"To whom it may concern,

This is a formal complaint against ______ for an unwanted sexual harassment. I am absolutely appalled by this advance and expect to be safe and protected from situations like this in a professional work environment. I’m requesting an immediate morning of Monday, April 1st 2019 to discuss the text messages that were sent to me from him on Saturday, March 30th. 

Please respond formally and confirm time of meeting. 

- Original Poster

Don’t send the screenshot of the text. Instead talk to them in person. Say you were offended and hurt, and you reacted poorly. Say you shouldn’t have responded, and instead should have contacted them first. After thinking, you wanted to come to them and let them know what had happened. You simply want a safe environment and to be allowed to work hard and succeed without worrying about your boss making sexual advances. 

Worst case, they fire you and you have a real lawsuit on your hands. 

This is coming from an executive recruiter and HR professional. "
37,The problem is that he said that. I think he feels miserable about his looks and he wants you to be miserable too.
38,"This is a great post. I was a family law attorney for about 10 years. I encountered several situations where parents were gaming so compulsively that they neglected their children, requiring state intervention - diapers not changed for 3-5 days, kids going without food...

&amp;#x200B;

Point is, this is a legit addiction, and, as you say, should be treated as such."
39,"&gt; I tried to stay with him for the childs sake.

So that your child could have the great experience of growing up with two parents who resent and mistrust each other? "
40,"Buying tickets to spend your joint bday weekend with your twin WITHOUT TELLING YOU was horribly insensitive and inappropriate.  I don't know what other things they've done, but this one particular item is WAY out of bounds.  So most likely your intuition is correct about how they feel/ behave in general.

We come out of childhood with an absolute burning desire to be understood and treated 'fairly' (whatever that means) by our parents.  It's an incredible need.  When our parents don't understand us or treat us fairly, the normal response is to try harder and harder to have them understand us and treat us fairly.

In your case, sadly, they don't seem to have the \*capacity\* to understand you, to understand how their actions affect you, or to treat you fairly.   If they legit don't have the \*capacity\* to be good parents in this regard, then you aren't going to get that childhood need for understanding and fairness fulfilled, at least not by your parents.  

That's crushingly sad, and probably will take some time and energy to process.  You won't feel better about it in 48 hours.  But if your parents aren't \*capable\*, it's important to see that because otherwise you will waste tons of precious emotional energy and time and spirit trying to get something that can't be gotten.

You can certainly have a direct conversation with them about how this makes you feel.  I'm not sure what the point is.  I think they've demonstrated they're unfair and not really able to or interested in changing.  So any conversation with them is wasted spirit.  I'd tend to think you'd be better off finding a good therapist to work through this with, and to spend your spirit developing friendships and relationships with people who are understanding and who do treat you with love and compassion.  

I had some significant deficits in how I was parented.  My parents are near the end of their lives now, and I have accepted that they'll never really 'understand' me or what I experienced.  It was a horrible, horrible time to come to that realization but it was still necessary.  Once I really accepted that, I could quite wasting energy in a dead end situation.  Instead, I have a cordial relationship with my parents (they are good people in many ways) and I spend my spirit developing real relationships that sustain me.

Obviously this is a quick take from a distance on a complex topic.  YMMV"
41,"Maybe I’m the only one, but something sounds off here. It sounds like he admitted to part of the truth. "
42,"Ugh...why do you want to even be friends with someone like this?

The whole tire thing is weird, awkward and just....off putting for a 30 something to act like this.  Let alone her history of questionable morals.  Why is she even in your social circle?"
43,"It's not your mother's choice. She doesn't get a say in this. It is your body and you, and only you, get to decide what you want to do with it.

Speak to your brother without your mom around. Make this clear to him, and make a pact with him that your mother will not get in the way of you guys. Pinky swear that no matter how aggressive she gets that you guys will make your own decisions without her influence.

&gt;Can someone help me understand her perspective?

Her perspective is just fear based. That's all you need to know. She's terrified and thus irrational. This has nothing to do with taking care of you guys and everything to do with losing you."
44,Take the job. Leave the boyfriend. 
45,"Two months is not enough time to get over such a betrayal.

She's re-directing the blame onto you to make you feel like the bad guy. This is a classic form of mental abuse that abusive partners use. Your brother is therefore correct.  You are the victim in an abusive marriage. "
46,I don't think you were being controlling at all. I would have done the same thing if it were any of my family members. Good for you OP.
47,"This was me as well for several years so I know your pain. My ex worked 40 hours a week, then played another 40 hours on his computer, raiding and all that. There would be lots of Saturday mornings where I wished he would just hang out with me in the kitchen while I cooked breakfast. Instead, he'd wake up, brush his teeth, and head straight upstairs and get on his computer. And that's where he'd stay for the next 15 hours. That was Saturday and Sunday, every weekend for years, on top of about 7 hours of gaming on weeknights, right after work. 

I tried talking to him about it several times, and every time it only made him more defensive about how he chose to relax. I have no problems with gaming, but I did have a problem with people hundreds and thousands of miles away getting to spend more time with my bf than I did and I was downstairs, basically living my life alone. I did all the groceries alone, the laundry, the dishes, bathing the dogs, watch movies, I did everything alone. I had never felt lonelier than in those moments. 

Hope you and your husband push past this and he sees the damage he is doing to your marriage. He can game if he wants, but he needs to be a husband too. 

"
48,"I love that OP is 15 and the mature one, the sister is 21 and not mature. 

And I totally agree. OP you will be an awesome partner to someone one day. "
49,"Yeah. OP, you sound like you kind of heard what you wanted to hear every time he was non-committal about marriage. He said nothing so you assumed you were on the same page. Of course, the mature thing for him to have done was tell you outright that he wasn't interested.

But if marriage is super important to you I'd start looking for a different guy. "
50,"1. Its highly inappropriate for a Manager to talk this way with an employee. 

2. It's even more inappropriate for a married man to talk this way to another woman.

3. It's not only inappropriate but highly disrespectful for your girlfriend to allow him to talk to her this way. I understand she loves the attention and compliments, but those should come from you, not a married sleezbag Manager.

Your feelings are definitely valid here, bud. I wouldn't let this fly at all. Either she focuses on you and tells him to stop, or you walk away and let them flirt all they want to. You deserve better than this. "
51,"“Oh man, so glad I’m not that guy.” - That Guy"
52,"You should be outraged that your girlfriend thinks she gets to demand shit in the way of your interactions with your own family members. Tell her that won't be happening, end of discussion. I would see this as a massive red flag. "
53,"He also went overdrawn because of this and had the audacity to ask me for money. **I essentially paid** for him to cheat on me.

Wait... you gave him the money?!?! Why on earth would you do that?"
54,"This isn't a roommate problem, this is a boyfriend problem. There's nothing stopping him from closing his door when he's on the phone &amp; nothing keeping him from setting other basic boundaries. Nor did anyone make him buy her a cake &amp; a card. The bad feeling in your gut should be for how he's treating you. "
55,"Not your circus, not your monkeys. If your sister wants to go down what seems like a dumb road to me, then you can't really do anything about it. Apologize for calling her engagement dumb (because that is rude), but IMO, you're completely right about her lack of respect for her boyfriend and I wouldn't apologize for the comments you made about her bf being her ""pet"". That's just fucked up on her part."
56,"i’m just gonna be straight up here, i’ve been in your girlfriend’s shoes before. i had an ex boyfriend that i got 4 little dots for on my finger. he did not like the idea because of the same reasons you’re saying, and i went ahead and did it anyway. i thought “even if we break up, i will still love him and this tattoo and all that he did for me”. fast forward a couple years: we broke up in a very awful way, i instantly regretted every time i looked at my finger, and i got it covered up. i truly, honestly, learned the hard way to NOT EVER DO what your girlfriend just did. i’m sorry for those who disagree with OP and me, but i’ve got the tattoo to prove my regret! "
57,"I don't think this is going to be that big of a deal. Claire just tells everybody ""I'm not sure why you thought I wasn't going to wear my glasses on my wedding day, because I am."" And then just holds her ground. 

Remember that this is YOUR wedding and that you guys get to say what goes. And anybody who takes issue with that can kindly uninvite themselves from the wedding. "
58,"Especially with siblings I think people can forget their boundaries. My best friend/roommate got married recently and I had to remember it’s not like when she was single and I could dig through her drawers looking for something to wear. I can’t just open up her bathroom cabinets and use her hairspray. While she and I had agreed this was fine before, now I have to consider her husbands privacy. "
59,"If I'm reading this right...

* you guys have been together less than 3 months

* in that time he has lied to you, kept lying to you, risked your health, and only felt contrition when caught (and apologized over text??)

* you have a chance for a clean slate when you leave for school

Treating you well when you guys aren't together isn't a huge woohoo - it is table stakes. Many men will do that. 

Without, you know, lying and risking your health. "
60,"You moved to his hometown, and lived there for 5 years, so that he would be happy.

Now he refuses to move *twenty minutes away*, or even just *walk your dog*, for you.

Please, please, please reconsider whether this is someone you want to build a life with."
61,"You are going to have to talk to her again.

This time be blunt that you do not like her tone toward the mother of your children. Yes, your ex has a lot of issues. Yes, she is not the most maternal person. Yes, she sometimes feels like another kid. There is a reason that you left her. There is a reason that you do most of the real parenting.

BUT

She is the mother of your children, and they deserve to have the best relationship with her that they can. You do not want anything that could possibly affect that adversely. Your GF's resentment toward your ex IS going to bleed over to the children, and you do not want any of that.

AND

You have to maintain a cordial relationship with this woman, because she is the mother of your children. The constant snark is not healthy for you and for that relationship.

Your GF is going to have to let go of this. It is a huge waste of emotional energy and brings a lot of negativity that neither of you need. 

You will continue to do whatever is right for your kids, and yes that means picking up slack. Why? because it is best for your kids. That is also why you don't bear any resentment. Your focus is on letting your kids be happy and love their mother despite her shortcomings."
62,"&gt;&gt;Is this fair because he earns more money?

It isn't fair, because you're partners, and it's actually dangerous to you, because not knowing what's happening with your shared $$ puts you in a very vulnerable position. I'm concerned that you think speaking up about a very serious concern over money would be entitled, greedy or whining. How does he manage to keep moneymatters hidden from you?"
63,"You’re very right. I think that’s why I was so angry with her last night. Like why bother asking me if you’re going to just ask him anyway? And it wasn’t about why he’d say no, just that I’d be ok with it.

The whole dialogue was just really strange and I didn’t understand what the hell she was trying to accomplish by our conversation? Maybe that’s why I’m here asking strangers as I’m so confused. She says she views him as a brother and that’s it.

And, yes, she’s rather immature. I guess going no contact with the exception of family gatherings is best. "
64,"Why do you keep offering to pay? I mean, it's clearly not being reciprocated. Have you asked him why he doesn't offer? He's a cheapskate. You need to decide if you want to date a cheapskate. "
65,"It’s unlikely they’ll actually contact the police, but general good advice is “don’t talk to the police without a lawyer.” "
66,And she was literally watching his house to see if the brother forgot to lock the door? Your partner’s story doesn’t add up. 
67,"He has made it obvious he doesn’t want to marry you. If this is a deal breaker for you and it seems to be,then you need to separate. "
68,I haven't seen anyone say this yet - please get yourself away from this man. He is a cheater and a creep. You should not have anything to do with him at all going forward.
69,"&gt;  Well, I found out through a mutual friend that J is planning on skipping the wedding and staying in town for the birthday party.

Well, then it's time to simply be blunt and tell J that this is a private event and that she's NOT invited. If she shows up, no one should open the door."
70,"Upfront and honest, ""I want to make sure you know I was born in X and my family are Y""

p.s. I burst out laughing at

&gt;our relationship is very healthy other than my whole nationality being a fraud.

&amp;#x200B;"
71,"If you're not comfortable you should tell him so, but I don't think you have much to stand on here considering you told him repeatedly you were okay with it. You need to know and respect your own boundaries."
72,"He told you that he's not sure you are the one.  

How long will it take for you to believe him?   

You aren't the one for him. "
73,"So, the family's strategy for dealing with a crazy person is for you to leave your job so as not to agitate her? 

That is truly laughable."
74,"&gt;a) you have a hot water tank that lasts for two hours

Not even close.  Might last half an hour or forty minutes.

&gt;Does he take the iPad in there or something?

His phone.  Yup."
75,"I personally like to be even with my partner on expenses but we still pay for each other's stuff without expecting money back as well. Not sure where your relationship is going with this massive red flag, you probably should bring it up and ask what's up with this."
76,"Med student here: he’s being a noob. He doesn’t have a uterus and clearly lacks a scientific background, so he can shut up "
77,"We all know this is 100% bullshit, lets just call it what it is.  Nobody uses it “to pass the time.”  How many times have we heard people use this exact same excuse in /r/relationships when busted?  He’s cheating or passively looking to cheat.

Nobody goes out, buys cocaine, and stares at the baggie for fun, thinking about how it’d be great to use it.  Nobody downloads tinder, hides it from their spouse, chats up people who want to hook up, and smiles at how nice of an idea it’d be."
78,"I think this is above Reddit's paygrade. You need to speak to a therapist about your feelings of grief (and yes, it is grief) and guilt. This is a hugely traumatic thing and whether or not you see your son again, you need help to heal from what happened."
79,"&gt; Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that?

So,.... you already know what you need to do.

Guess what, it is time to adult. Adulting means ignore the awkwardness and having those conversations anyway. Why? because reasonable boundaries are necessary.

""Yo, SIL, I need you to respect my privacy. Stop going into my bedroom. Nope. No excuses, there is literally no reason for you to enter without asking my permission first."""
80,"Dallasite here - I almost never drink, it's not an issue at all. Honestly, no one cares. I really don't understand why it would be an issue to your boyfriend; it makes me wonder if he just wants to be single in a new scene. 

This is a great city and you could have a great life here, but lose the boyfriend for sure."
81,Ya his reaction wasn’t “please try to drink again” or “can you come out with us even if you don’t drink” but “let’s end things since you can’t drink”. I wouldn’t be surprised if he met some other girl.
82,"Good grief. Have you ever heard the saying "" don't set yourself on fire to keep another person warm"". You need to walk away from this mess. Your wife is clearly not going to change and doesn't care about you at all. There is no fixing this. Go to Loveisrespect.org for more information."
83,He sounds gross. “Commoner jobs” like he’s fucking royalty. 
84,"Good parents support the person their child loves because they want to make their child happy.  You see Alan being unhappy?  That's because of *their* actions, not yours.  

They are not such good parents."
85,"Huge red flag. She has you in a situation where your only option is to accept her behavior, no matter how ridiculous it is.

  


When someone cheats, it's their responsibility to do most of the work to make things right again. They need to be arranging for counseling, working to regain trust, and asking their partner what the cheater needs to do for the partner to feel safe again. It doesn't sound like she's done that. She apologized, sure. That's step one in a long, long process of rebuilding trust. The fact that she's acting indignant \*two months later\* and acting like this is your problem, not hers, is a huge red flag.

You need to start looking at documentsa and figuring out how you can legally disentangle yourself from her. Until you do, she is going to continue blaming you when she does something wrong."
86,I never wanted her in my life to begin with. 
87,He’s not sorry. He’s just sorry he got caught. 
88,"You need to talk to her and let her know that her actions have consequences that affect other people, but if I were in your situation, I would take a very different approach from the one you are thinking of.  

If you send her that message, and come right out of the gate swinging with ""why do you always lie and over-exaggerate stuff? like all the time"", you will be giving her an opportunity to deflect the conversation into irrelevancies.  She'll argue over the meaning of ""all the time"".  She'll argue over ""always"".  She'll miss the *point* of the whole thing.

If it were me, I would say it like this (and I would do it in *person*, not over text, because text is not a good medium for important and emotionally-charged communications):

""[Sister], when you lie to me about things, it makes me feel as if I cannot trust you and that I do not want to be open with you about things that are important to me.  I value our relationship, but in order for it to be the close one we have had, I need to be able to trust that when you tell me things, they are true, and I need to know why you chose to lie to me about [the things she lied about].  Can you do that for me?""

If you take that approach, there's nothing for her to argue *with*, because you are not making statements about absolute truths, you are making statements about how you *feel* and what you *need*."
89,"Honestly? You seeing her as a mother figure is nowhere near as bad as where I thought this was going. She's young enough to be your sister, but she also clearly has acted in a maternal way towards you and she's your de facto stepmother, so I don't think these feelings are necessarily wrong. It's a weird situation, but that happens in life sometimes.

If you care about her this much, definitely visit her in hospital if you're close by, or call her if you're not. Being in hospital can be so boring. If you look out for her the way she's been looking out for you, I think that will be fine."
90,"I already have the texts backed up somewhere else, definitely keeping that.

I feel weird letting them see the really nasty message I sent but I feel like they might see it anyway so maybe it is better from me?"

We've got a winner.
"
92,"This.

You can still go out with friends in a city with “drinking culture” and not drink. Any real friends wouldn’t have an issue with this. I don’t drink but I’ll go to a bar or club with my friends and have a blast. I’ll usually smoke a little weed beforehand and just sip on a red bull while I’m out. He’s just latching on to an excuse from what I can gather from your post. "
93,"I don't think they isolated him. They encouraged him to have friends, be more social, to have hobbies, letting him live by himself since he was 17 year old and gave down payment money for his first car. They were happy for Alan when he got married until divorce. 

The thing is, they're immersed into deaf culture because of their son. I think they find anything that's not part of his son's culture is an attack of Alan and everything that entails. I believe they're forgetting being deaf or any impairment does not define a person. Does that make sense? At least it's one of my theories.

They're good parents, just not friendly at me. "
94,"If he truly felt this way, fine. It is true that you can fall for someone entirely due to their personality.


What was callous of him was voicing that opinion. And furthermore, adding the little fact him and his friends made a nickname for you? Uncalled for.


I agree with the comments here saying that the problem here is that he decided now was a good time to mention something that he should have known would hurt you. He felt down, so he possibly wanted to bring you down with him. I say possibly because it could also just be some misplaced comments of someone who has been with you for so long and is now comfortable saying these things outright.


Regardless, I do think he owes you an apology of some sort. Sure, as some people here are trying to see the positive side; it can mean he loves you and looks didn't have a play in that. But hearing it how he said it, would still be such a painful shock.

"
95,"My step brother was like this, taking an hour long shower with 6 people and 2 bathrooms in the house. One water heater. After awhile my mom got sick of my stepdad saying he is his son and this is his house too. She told him he had 15min and then would shut the water off and wouldn't turn  it back on til the next person got in the shower. "
96,I can't imagine how you can have *any* libido after watching your boyfriend sit around the house doing nothing all day long.  
97,That sounds tough. I’m sorry I don’t think any of us are in a position to attempt to diagnose your wife because we’re not qualified to do so and we don’t know your wife in real life. It’s possible she was so calm about it because she’s been checked out of the relationship for a long time. In the end I’m not sure whether it matters whether she’s on the spectrum or not. It sounds like you need to figure out the best way to move forward for your kids. Best of luck to you 
98,"I literally forgot to lock my apartment balcony's door (a fucking balcony) one night and my stalker crawled into bed with me at 3am. So, yes. It's possible."

101,So this guy is telling you that he isn't willing to compromise for your sake. That's not someone that you can build a life with. 
102,"Winner, winner, chicken dinner.  

This reads to me like he moved to Dallas, reconnected with friends and started living like he's single again.... and found that he's enjoyed it (and possibly found someone else).  "
103,"You’re being purposefully obtuse here. Your bf flat out TOLD YOU that you were not the one, and that he was unsure.

He is stringing you along with his lack of answer. You’re the one that is choosing to hold out false hope. How much more obvious can it get when he told you with his own words and his own mouth that he’s not sure about you??? 

If you want to be married, this is not the guy for you. Don’t waste more time in a relationship where the guy isn’t sure of you after almost three years. It will NEVER get better, he won’t suddenly decide you’re the one. At most he will settle for you, and is that really the marriage you want??"
104,Thoughts? These are the kinds of problems that come up when you date an asshole. *Don't do that.* Problem solved.
105,"&gt; What should I have done? I'm honestly bewildered.

Not waited a whole two days and six hours for her to get her life together.

This woman is almost FIFTY. She’s not a clueless teenager venturing out for the first time. My money is on “she got trashed with her cousin and blew you off.” This is totally unacceptable, and the quickness with which she turned it around on you makes me think she’s done this to other people before and gotten similar reactions. 

I’d be done. At minimum, you need to massively lower your expectations with this woman and never do her big favors like this again. She’s not going to hold up her end of the deal and you’ll be left feeling foolish and used. "
106,"He sabotaged you on purpose because if you start improving your confidence and your situation he knows you’ll start to recognize how toxic he is. He can’t let you realize you deserve a partner who doesn’t demean you. He’s actively tearing you down when he KNOWS you’re devestated about blowing the assessment. He told you, point blank, the he didn’t forget what you were doing. When people tell you who they are, believe them. "
107,"Gay guy here. If I were dating some dude and then he told me he was actually straight, I'd kick his ass out, too. It's a big sign that her own gay friends know she's being shitty."
108,"Oh, dude, it’s so okay to leave him. I’m sorry. You don’t need him to *understand* why you’re leaving him—it doesn’t sound like he’ll listen. You just need to leave. "
109,"&gt;making me want to step back slightly from my relationship with my parents

Absolutely do this. They haven't earned a great relationship with you, where you help them out and put in effort. Next time they ask for something just tell them that's not possible for you. (Personally I would suggest they ask brother, but I'm petty like that.) Prepare for manipulation and guilt trips. They are used to treating you like trash and getting away with it. Your feelings are valid and you do not deserve to be called over sensitive. Maybe do some googling or see a therapist to learn how to set *and enforce* appropriate boundaries."
110,"After reading your comments the thread should be about how you need routine and face serious anxiety when in uncomfortable social situations. That is the problem. Because in one form or another, situations will arise your whole life that you need to be socially assertive through. This one is irrelevant if you don't have the tools to negotiate them in the future. I'd focus on that and work on honing yourself for the future. It might make a difference in salary negotiation and a lot of other important things in the future.

111,"I mean, you might consider that being a misogynist racist is why he's never had a girlfriend."
112,Do you want to date someone like this?
113,"What a shit family. I’m so sorry you had to put up with that cunt and your shitty parents enabling her. Please please please find any/all documents about everything during that time.

* witnesses cooberating your leaving time
* witnesses cooberating your attendance at work

"
114,"Reading your comments as well....

* Sex dreams are totally outside her control. So, please, stop holding her accountable to them. Accountability and trying someone recognize error only works if they actually can change the behavior. All you are doing is embarrassing her and perhaps exacerbating existing guilt (I sometimes feel an irrational guilt after such dreams.) It feels petty and distancing as a recieving partner. 

* If you are worried she has a crush on some other guy, just ask her - not accusatorally, but to put some air back in the room. If she says she does, ask her if you can help dealing with it (crushes are a pain in the ass) - if she says she doesn't, for the sake if your 10 years, believe her and move on. 

*,Completely separately, (but given some things implied in your comments), if you are feeling deprioritized relative to her job (and now this sex dream about an coworker is potentially exacerbating it) - address that directly. 

You maybe mixing a few sources of questions / insecurity together into a gordian knot that actually need to be ID'ed and solved in a more isolated manner. "
115,"The important thing is to NOT try to 'pay them back' in the sense of 'reimburse them' or 'put in the same number of hours as they do.""

They are doing these wonderful things because they love you.  When someone gives you something  from a place of love, the most important thing you can do is \*accept it from a place of love.\*   Instead of feeling guilty, try to really rejoice and be grateful for the love they are showing you.  I know it \*seems\* like you should feel bad because you aren't 'carrying your weight' but that's not how love gifts work.  Accept it gratefully, joyfully and manifest to them how much it means to you.  

One way is words:  Tell them how much it means to you, how it makes it possible to do the things you want to do.  You may want to choose words that go to the deeper meaning:  ""I am so grateful for all you do for us, like cooking this fantastic meal ... but I'm \*even more\* grateful for the love underneath this.  I just feel blessed.""

Then try to find ways to show love back.  Not as 'paying them back' but just letting the loving relationship develop.  It would probably mean more to them if you planned something the four of you could do on a Saturday than if  you spent those hours doing laundry. Find time to spend with them.  Notice them.  Get them something small but that plays to their personality.  Listen to their stories.  Ask about their childhood.  When they tell you a story about their childhood, bring it up in conversation a month later so they know you were really paying attention.  If they are good at it, ask for life advice and at least occasionally follow it lol.   Behave towards them in such a way as to make sure that they know the loving relationship  is growing on your side as well as theirs."
116,"I feel like his explanation doesn’t explain much at all. Why is someone contacting your sister on fb now, 8 years afterwards? And if it did happened 8 years ago, long before you two were dating, why was it referred to as cheating in the message?"
117,"To add to this:

If you are direct, and they treat you differently or respond negatively to your comment, they aren't really a good friend. 

Also any guy worth going out with should be more respectful towards you about their interest in dating/FwB, rather than just tryna cop a feel when they have you over in what you thought was just a platonic setting."
118,"This is straight up gaslighting.

Is her name on the lease? If not, I'd tell her she has 30 days (or whatever is legal in your area) to find a new place. If she is, I'd see if you can speak to the landlord about breaking the lease early and only stay for as long as you've already paid rent for."
119,"&gt; I feel weird letting them see the really nasty message I sent but I feel like they might see it anyway so maybe it is better from me?

My best guess is that it would be.

Can you not e-mail HR right now already? Possibly even contact them via e-mail/phone only for now without even having to show your face at the office Monday morning?"
120,Natures way of telling you that youre incompatible?
121,I think this is really important and OP/OP and her bf should look into this. It’s very strange.
122,"Unfortunately, when you are 17, knowing you are in the right (you are) isn't all that gratifying to focus on. 

Instead, focus on what you are going to do when you are 18 to not be subject to such behavior:

* save your money. Money is a key lever of independence. The car sounds cool. The luxury of avoiding your mom's control could be cooler. 

* finish school strong: get the good grades. Be helpful to teachers. The academics at your age matter.

* decide what you want to do after high school (college? Trade?) And start equipping yourself for it - skills, part time job, research the right pre-reqs for scholarships -whatever to make yourself the most attractive candidate possible. 

* stay healthy. You've made good choices about drugs and booze, so stick with it. They are paths to dependence. 

* fortify your support system. Resist any urge to isolate yourself and stay as good a friend / mentee (find mentors if you dont have them!) as you can. "

125,"You guys disagree on the fundamental nature of a relationship you wish to have. There is no greater incompatibility than that. It's fine to want to be monogamous, but you need your partner to want the same thing. You guys are not a good fit for each other, and should not be together."
126,"This is going to be so hard. Your whole life just got rocked. But you need to leave him. He does not deserve you and you deserve so much better. You will spend the rest of your life together doubting him and not trusting him and it will drive you crazy. It will turn you into the batshit controlling partner that you never want to be. Anytime he wants to go out with friends, he comes home late from work, his phone buzzes, etc. you will wonder. Wonder what he's really doing, wonder who he's talking to. And it will just eat away at you. You're better spending that energy on bettering yourself (not that there is anything wrong with you, this is, in no way, your fault), focus on your happiness, take up a hobby you've been meaning to get into, reconnect with friends/family, do anything productive! I wish you all the best and I'm so sorry this is happening to you. "
127,"Her questioning you can read like ""will you give me permission to go after your husband?"" She knew he might say no, she knew you wouldnt say yes, but she knew she had to rub it into your face. Why she felt the need to rub her weird attraction to your husband in your face, I dont know why. Maybe shes narcissistic. 

&gt; I guess going no contact with the exception of family gatherings is best.

This is your best bet, at least for now. She wont follow your boundaries, and she doesnt care about your husband boundaries, so limiting contact to only when it has to happen will help you both deal with her."

130,"If your daughter came to you with this same story, would you tell her to stay?

Aren't you lonely now every time you look at him and remember what he did? I would strongly suggest you talk to a counselor about this. At some point, you daughter is going to be grown and you're still going to be with a man who recklessly endangered your life and destroyed what was normal and functioning in you. Being a good father and good provider is the minimum hurdle for a parent. You're giving him a pass and martyring yourself."
131,"They're blaming you because they all feel guilty that they didn't bother looking for the incompetent and badly attired diabetic when she went missing, and then sent you to do it. You're the scapegoat for their own idiocy, and hers.

Your family's behaviour is astonishing and cruel and you need to really consider if you want to be around such toxic people. That your parents automatically believed that you would do this is a pretty damning indictment of them. 

"
132,"It’s not controlling to protect your cousin at all. If anything, more people in the comments should be outraged that the older boy was allowing a girl that young to flirt with him. I wish I’d had an older cousin or sibling step in when I was 13 and trying to date a 21 year old. The cousin is lucky to have you looking out for her and if your girlfriend doesn’t see a problem with what was happening and understand why you stepped in, that’s on her. There’s nothing wrong with protecting family like that. "
133,"In your last post he said that he would get a steady job, an apartment, and go to therapy. There is a check mark on the job part, but what about an apartment and therapy?

People can change, but only when they actually follow through the plan of **action** that they promised when they were apologizing. So, I hope he is following through.

Honestly, therapy is the most important. He needs to be in it. And, again, I hope did follow through on that."
134,"Yeah, I thought he was going to say she's interested in him romantically and he's starting to be too. 

When I was 27 (32 now), I viewed and still view 20 year old guys pretty much the same as I wpuld view a teenage guy. Sorry if that offends anyone but they're like kids to me. I think it's relatively common that an 18-20 year old guy would view a 27 year old woman as quite a bit ""older"". Totally depends on personalities, life stages etc - but sounds like she's a lot older at heart than this guy so it doesn't seem so weird that he'd view her like a step mother figure if she's with his dad. "
135,"Shut off the Internet, that’ll speed things up"
136,"The very first thing I would do is let him know I’m downloading tinder and watch his reaction.

The next thing I would do is talk to a lawyer. This guy is abusive and he’s the worst and he doesn’t respect you at all. "
137,I’d bet he likes your lack of confidence because it makes you easier to manipulate. I’d bet he did this on purpose.
138,"that was my first thought too, but from OP's grammar and spelling he's not a native English speaker; maybe in his country, the culture is different. /u/Moid999 - in your country, is it expected that adults ""obey"" their parents to a greater extent than in the USA?"
139,"He isn't that Catholic if he's sleeping with you outside the bonds of marriage. Get the abortion if you want to, there's no reason to tell him.

"
140,"&gt;  But we fight, sometimes like we're both on fire. I've never felt as passionate about anyone as I do about her, and I've never fought such heated fights with anyone before. It's weird...I've had a few relationships, and they all felt lacking. I was never very interested in sex, I never felt like I loved them. But we got along, and didn't argue or fight. Now I'm with my wife, and I know I love and adore her, I finally crave and enjoy sex, I'm hot as hell for her, both physically and emotionally.  

**You are romanticizing extreme toxicity.** 

Love does not mean tumultuous, ""firey"" fights. Love means open, honest, and understanding **discussion**. And it sounds like you are NOT having that. 

If I fought so aggressively with someone, I would want to leave too. It's not healthy, and you don't *really* sound like you think there is a problem with it. Fighting like that isn't ""passion."" It's TOXIC. And sad.

Tell her how you found the journal, tell her what you read, and **talk**, not fight, about it. If you feel like you two can not have a calm discussion about this, go to couples therapy and talk about it there. 

And, you should be in therapy on your own, as well."
141,"You are not a bad person for giving up on this relationship. Depression doesn’t *make* someone say hurtful things. He is hurting you.

&gt;She came on our honeymoon

And you should have been in a lawyer's office to file for an annulment the morning after you got back.

I don't know what you expect people here to tell you.   The only therapy that would be appropriate would be for you so that you can straighten out whatever twisted notions led you to get involved with him in the first place.

"
144,"I suspect a large part of your low confidence is the way your SO treats you, and that he is actually not a ""JustYES"" at all.

I am appalled by his behavior. I too think it was intentional sabotage. Given the clear emotional abuse you're subject to (how he tries to make everything your fault), I wouldn't be surprised at all.

&gt;He will go over the top to make sure whatever happened is my fault.

This is emotional abuse. This is not the behavior of a good partner. That you feel you can't even talk to him about this issue that is weighing on your mind a month later because it would go badly for you - I can't express how sad that makes me.

&gt;The issue occurs whenever he is challenged, criticised in any way or asked to do anything to help

How people respond when they are challenged or criticized shows who they really are. The MOST IMPORTANT things in a relationship are to have someone who supports you and who you can solve problems with, and your SO is neither of those things. No amount of other good things will ever overcome how bad these two bad things are, since they are the very foundations of what makes a relationship successful.

If you are staying with him, in the future, don't do important things where he can interrupt you. If your library has study rooms, reserve a study room. Get a hotel room. Any other important things you have to do, assume he will sabotage and put measures in place to physically prevent that."
145,"I'm sorry your parents suck (they owe you a *massive* grovelling apology but I'm not holding my breath). Personally I wouldn't ever be speaking to your cousin and her family again and avoiding them wherever possible. Not without a lawyer present anyway. Who knows what kind of bullshit they'll try in the future.

It is difficult but it is actually possible to completely ignore someone even if you're in the same room as them (such as at the next family wedding). You'll get called rude for it, but if they try to talk at you going forward I'd totally bring up the time they accused you of attempted murder."
146,"&gt;My boyfriend has gone off at me multiple times saying that I'm slacking off and not working hard. He also keeps degrading me telling me I'm not smart like him and the only reason he's unemployed is because he has high standards and won't do ""common jobs"" like retail. I'm working 50 hour weeks whilst he does 4 hours supervising university students and he always complains I'm not making time for him since I'm working. He knows my shift hours, so when I'm not working I always make time for him, but he's off doing his own recreational activities whenever I'm free even though I feel like he should be the one to adjust his minimal schedule for me. We end up arguing all the time over this.

&amp;#x200B;

Just read this paragraph back to yourself. Imagine a friend came to you and described their relationship like this.

&amp;#x200B;"
147,Maybe you should hook up John with Jane?
148,"It might be wise to apologize for swearing at the boy, but don't back down. Would your wife have come unglued if you has just thumped on the door and growled, 'Get out, right NOW' ?

If not, then it's all gravy. Just omit the cuss next time. If yes, then you and your wife need to have a discussion about boundaries and setting firmer guidelines for the boy. Chris taking two hour long showers is ludicrous!! It doesn't matter whether he's having some solo time or not, it doesn't take 2 hours. The fact you didn't react this firmly ages ago says a lot about your patience. 
I see where your wife is coming from, perhaps sit down with her and Chris to go over it as family unit.

"
149,"Why do you think working, buying stuff for the home and doing all the chores isn't contributing?"
150,"Cut Jane out of your life ASAP because she’s a straight up bitch, I’m serious. What an awful human being. If she’s so thirsty for him, she can try to get his attention instead of being salty that he’s interested in you. You did the right thing, OP, clearly you both want different things in life and it’s not going to work it. You should never go in to a relationship expecting someone to change.   "
151,"Yep. Brother should say it. If he’s like me, he will love giving his siblings shit for random weird things they do like this. "
152,No that is what a friend should do.  he just doesn't like having to face the hard reality of his behavior and how terrible he treats people.  He treats these women as disposable parts of his life.  Oh the next one is better i'm on to her.  Good for you for sticking up to him.  You don't really want to be a friend going forward with someone that's values are so different than yours
153,I didn’t know why he had gotten overdrawn- I found out later
154,"&gt;The next thing I know, I half-wake up (I'm a heavy sleeper) and he's moving around his apartment looking for things. And lastly, went I finally wake up again (3-4am) he's suddenly talking about the amazing night he had at the bar with the female and her friends.

This is what strikes me, and why I don't think you're irrationally or over-jealous. He didn't wake you up to tell you or try to get you to come after he already told HER he was staying in with his girlfriend. Which makes me think she didn't want to take no for an answer? 

You said they drink alone in the past, how many times? They're spending a huge amount of time together and it's concerning only to me because you felt excluded when you tried to spend time with both of them. YOUR boyfriend shouldn't let you feel like that with another woman who it sounds like he sees more than you lately..."
155,It honestly sounds like he’s just looking for a reason to break up. You not drinking is a pretty weak excuse and leads me to believe something else is behind it. I am married to someone who doesn’t drink and doesn’t do the whole party/bars thing. It hasn’t affect our relationship in the slightest because couples don’t have to do everything together and you don’t need to drink to have fun. 
156,"As mean as this sounds, I used to be 300lbs and desperate for friends... so was she. So we just gravitated to each other.

She’s pretty much stayed the same over the years, maybe even gone down hill with her morals and escapades, but I’ve lost all my weight (an issue she has with me as I no longer pig out with her) and as my mom puts it “out grown Lola’s maturity level.” The reason she’s in my social circle is because she’s apart of our family now and my mom looks at her like a daughter. She’s always invited to family events by even my extended family.

At this point, I feel like I was just her friend out of the fear of being lonely. All my friends, and my husband, who have met her always ask why were friends as she’s, “not someone they’d know me to hangout with.” But when I hear these things and catch myself agreeing, I feel like a piece of shit.

Like, “Oh, I lost weight and am hot and popular now, don’t need you!” I don’t want to be that kind of person...  but I feel as if her behaviour is way out of line. "
157,"Yes, definitively.
OP, I find it surprising that you are already looking at venues and discussing ring price even though there has been no proposal or actual agreement of proposal timeline.
Given the lack of commitment from him, it feels like you are getting a bit ahead of yourself and potentially build false hope :/
I think you need to have another discussion with your boyfriend and try to figure out if your respective expectations can be managed and brought to a compromise. Otherwise this might become an incompatibility."
158,"Yeah, she was my ex. We had only dated for 6 mos, and broke up a month or so prior and had gone no contact. I woke up to her crawling in my bed at 3am, like it was normal. She said softly, ""Go back to sleep."" So, I rolled back over to go back to sleep. About five seconds later, I shot up, turned on the lights and was like, what. the. fuck. I told her, ""You probably need to go."" She didn't say anything else, got up, and left. She worked about 3 miles away and didn't have a car. So, she had walked her happy ass 3 miles, in the middle of the night, crawled up my balcony, and got very, very lucky it was unlocked that one night.. In my mind I want to believe she only tried that one night. Also in my mind, I want to believe that she wouldn't have slit my throat if I went back to sleep. It fucked me up for a while though. Any noise in my apartment woke me up."
159,Whoever doth protest can take a long walk off a short pier. Or just be removed from the wedding party.
160,"""It made me uncomfortable."" Repeat as needed. If you give her a reason, she can argue with you about whether it's a good reason. She can't argue with the fact that you feel something. "
161,"Your husband and you should be a united front. Say you don't want to mix property, business, and family together at this point, and with all the care the property needs, it's just not going to work out. "
162,"You didnt do anything wrong. Don’t apologize. 

Something I’ve seen in young adults who don’t have much exposure to early teenagers is an overestimation of their maturity. If most of your experience with 14 year olds is from being 14, you just don’t have the understanding of what that looks like from the outside. A 14 year old may feel mature but they are not operating with an adult brain. 

Your GF may also be projecting from a personal experience that she had near that age but I wouldn’t want to speculate on that. "
163,"&gt;I can tell deep down he loathes it because he has to see the life his ex and brother have built together.

I think that's incorrect. He's probably been ""over"" her for a long time. His sadness isn't about seeing a life you built together or about him having wanted a life with her. It's about you not being the person he thought you were. From his perspective, you had an emotional affair with his very recent ex (an emotional affair that may have even started while they were still together) who he may have thought he'd get back together with.  His hurt has nothing to do with jealousy or his former feelings for her, but for the betrayal of his brother.

Or maybe he's not even ""hurt"" anymore. Maybe he simply thinks it's wise to keep distance from you, because you've shown yourself to be untrustworthy. His distance isn't about past or present hurts, but about choosing not to put himself in a situation that could result in a new hurt. We are the company we keep, and if he thinks you're untrustworthy or of poor character, he doesn't want to be deemed guilty by association. "
164,"Well, he only now has the money for first last and deposit, so he’s actively looking for a place to start living in next month. The job he’s currently at won’t give him health insurance until he has been working there for six months but is soon as he has health insurance then he will get into therapy. Thanks for keeping me honest and checking in about that stuff."
165,I’m sorry this happened to you. Him using your money to betray you is beyond the pale. 
166,He doesn't want to marry you.
167,"So while he's lounging on his arse, how's the rent being paid?"
168,"Report to police. Now. Get a restraining order and take your child away.
It may seem daunting but you have to be strong and get this done. For your safety and the baby’s."
169,"""She Feels Like Your Mom and Doesn't Want to Bang Yu"" -- read it and have your wife read it too.   It's time for her to step back into a partner role.   

Stop doing every for her. Make up a chore chart if necessary to help you withdraw from the chores.  Same goes for meal planning and cooking.  Does she work?  If not, why not?"
170,"Of course you can't ""work this out"", if that means stay in the relationship and fix it. Your wife, over a long period of time and with the advice of multiple therapists, won't even BEGIN to accept the possibility she's abusive. There is no, none, zero, 0, nada chance of ""working this out"". You need to leave, man. It does suck, and I'm sorry, but there really is life beyond this."
171,Gotta love when people who have no stake in your relationship try to tell you what to do. Tell everyone to mind their own business. You don't owe your ex unconditional support.
172,"I have had sex dreams about Jason momoa but I assure you I'm not actually sleeping with him, much to my dismay."

174,"She's proven that she's impervious to hints, it's time to be direct. 

Actually, the incident today would have been an ideal time to bring it up.  When she poked her nose in your room you should have sat up and told her that the door was closed because its your private space and you would appreciate it if she would stop encroaching --whether or not you are home.

You could also tell your brother that you are fed up with her nosiness and that the next time you catch her at it, you will not be polite about telling her off.  If he doesn't step up and tell her to stop, you will have to do it yourself.


"
175,"It's not ""using her,"" it's ensuring he has access to his own finances and resources so he can leave without losing what's his. It's wrong to ""use"" people under any circumstances."
176,"Don't move in with a guy who punches holes in walls and smashes TVs.     
Don't move in with a guy who throws tantrums and gets furious over random and minuscule things.  
Don't move in with a guy who **scares you**, even *sometimes*.   
I know you want to help him, but you should never stay with somewith in the expectation that you can *fix him*. You can't.  
  
The world is full of guys who don't have *outbursts of rage*.   
Break up with this power keg, and find one of those."
177,I think it's time for you to call community services and figure out how to get away from your parents. They're abusive and you really need to start your own life.
178,"The 45 year old married man who knocked up an 18 year old is the deceitful, immoral creep here. 

You need to do what is best for you and your future. 

That is the only angle here. 

You have to make the decision you are willing to live with and believe will be best for you. If you feel a moral obligation to discuss this with him, then you can do so, but you've asked for opinions and mine is Absolutely No. 

You do not owe him this conversation or this information, *especially* if you think he will be unkind or refuse to respect your choice here. 

You should also take steps to be free of this person who groomed you and abused you and who you know recognize will not support and respect you to the absolute degree you deserve.  Please, if you do nothing else, remove this horrible man from your life completely. "
179,"Dude, I was in the same boat with my (soon to be) ex husband. Tried years of therapy. Led to a dead bedroom. Finally, I had enough. It was the loneliest I had ever felt while living with someone. Let alone being married.

Now, I'm actually alone and I LOVE it. I'm happy even when I'm not happy, if that makes sense. I'm free.

OP, I wish you all the luck in the world. But just remember, we have one life. If he won't change, than it's up to you to make one for yourself."
180,"So, why did you accept this guy's proposal?

&gt;He lives with his parents.    
&gt;  
&gt;He can't find jobs by himself.   
&gt;  
&gt;she's like a crutch to him.    
&gt;  
&gt;He insists on having her live with us.   
&gt;  
&gt;She insists it's none of my business.   
&gt;  
&gt;I feel like I have no voice. 

This guy is not ready to be married. He's not ready to be a partner. He's not ready to be an independent adult. You've basically described someone who couldn't be more unprepared for marriage or cohabitation with a serious partner.

I think it's time you end the relationship."
181,"He's making an impossible demand in order to remain in his safe space, his parent's home. He's telling you that you will be in a thruple. Her opinions will be more important, she will be given a say in YOUR life, and she'll be the one he turns to for emotional support and the final decision on any issue.

He REALLY doesn't want to move in with you. He doesn't want to leave his parent's house. Hopefully, he knows that you won't agree to be the third wheel in a household entirely based on his needs and wishes. "
182,"&gt;Her reasoning seems to only be that people do not die in this day in age from the flu and pneumonia.

He didn't. He died from sepsis and organ failure...

&gt;I soon realized it was pointless to argue with her

This is a universal truth.

&gt;My husband’s brother and parents have all awknowleged that she is nuts, but have actually suggested that I quit my job to make thing easier because there are other hospitals in town I could work for.

Oh, so they're ALL crazy? Fuck, that's tough.

OP. You have my condolences. I hope you find a way through this. "
183,"No phone in the bathroom and an oven timer might be a good place to start as solutions.

Honestly, it should be a *“If you want to take 2 hour showers, do it in the morning when you aren’t inconveniencing anyone, otherwise you are limited to 15 minutes and need to be out BEFORE 8:30 (or whatever time works for you), every minute past that you lose an hour of phone time.*"
184,Yup. Use her for a bit. She deserves it.
185,"Video game addiction is just as bad as a drug addiction, in my opinion. As someone who has dabbled in both...they lead you to ignoring friends, being selfish, treating your partner poorly and give you a false sense of accomplishment and validation.

Guess what? None of us spend 60+ hours a week 'relaxing'. If he needs 60 hours of relaxing time, he needs to be in treatment.

Relaxing is an hour a night, maybe two. 

The only time I've seen success with this type of stuff is to give an ultimatum. I actually have seen a lot of people give their partners the 'list'.

Ask him this simple thing.

What is most important to him in his life.

Then ask him how much time he spends on each of these things.

Rank them in order.

Ask him if that is how he wants to live his life."
186,I wouldn't disrespect my bf like that and I'm not even that great of a gf. 
187,"My friend told me that her brother’s step-children (who are both adults, by the way, around 20 years old) have a bucket in their room that they use as a toilet so they don’t have to pause their games in order to go to the bathroom. From what my friend told me, the whole family, including their mom, joke about it like it’s funny. And apparently they’re not the only gamers who use the poop bucket method. "
188,"I actually used to be *exactly* like that as well, so maybe some of my circumstances apply to your boyfriend as well. 

First off, it's a self esteem thing. I'd think very negatively of myself, and if I'd get compliments, it would feel like I'd somehow deceived other people into viewing them more positively than they should, basically relationship impostor syndrome. And that was an incredibly unpleasant feeling, people saying these nice things about me when I *knew* they were actually wrong and I was not really smart/handsome/nice/whatever.

Second, it was also a family thing. My dad is not a person to say anything positive about anything, and my mom could be pretty volatile, so she'd go from ""You're the most wonderful son ever"" to ""You're an ungrateful piece of shit"" in the span of like ten minutes. And that made me see compliments I received as somehow inherently disingenuous, or conditional on me behaving the way people wanted me to behave. 

It was actually through romantic relationships that I learned to be happy about compliments, so it's something that can change with time. My advice would be the following: 
- Don't stop giving him compliments, but maybe try and make them more specific, so he knows/realizes you actually appreciate something and aren't just saying it. For example, instead of ""You're great"", you can go for ""I love how your homemade hummus tastes"", or ""I love your forearms"", or ""You look really cute whenever you see me laugh"", or ""That shirt looks really nice on you"", or ""It's really impressive how you handled that situation"", etc.
- Don't overload him though. If he's the way I used to be, part of him enjoys them in reality, and he'd sorely miss them if you actually stopped forever, but at the same time it's difficult to handle, and very difficult to acknowledge to yourself you're allowed to feel good about them. So, taking it slowly might help

Also, it's awesome that you're so thoughtful as to think about how to make this better for him, he's lucky to have you!"
189,"I think you're being perfectly reasonable - but it doesn't matter what I think.  

The reality is that she's asking you for something that's important to her.  If it's something that you can adapt to and do occasionally (in your own way - and not just by copying what others are doing), then it might be worth doing it to make her happy.  

If she's generally demanding and difficult and if you're going to be faced with a never ending need to adapt in order to please her, then it's probably not worth it.  But if it truly makes her happy, and she's willing to adapt in a similar way when something else is important to you, then give it a try, and see how it goes.

(while of course remembering that whatever you post may be there forever.)"
190,"..you might just need a bigger place and to open your mouth and say things like ""Please don't offer me unhealthy food."" or ""You need to replace the food processor"" instead of bottling everything up. "
191,"Ultimately is your friendship with him worth having to put up with her invading your life? It might be you decide it is, and that's fair, but if it's not, better just to set a few basic boundaries and let the chips fall where they may."
192,"&gt;i dont want to sound shallow but sometimes i'd like to be treated.

You're 4 months in, you're determining what you want in a relationship and whether or not this guy is compatible with those things. That's the point of this stage right now.

He is clearly not compatible with what you want in a partner (personally I would feel the same way). This relationship is wayyy too short for such a significant incompatibility, personally I would end it. "
193,"It’s reasonable for you to feel however you feel, and it’s reasonable for you to express those feelings, and ask your girlfriend to consider them.  It’s also reasonable for her to decide whether or not it’s a boundary she’d be willing to accept.  If it’s not, you two may not be compatible, without it meaning that either one of you is in the wrong."
194,"The dreams can upset you (I think that’s pretty normal), but **they are not her fault**, and they do not mean she is cheating.

There’s really nothing to “bring up” here. She can’t control her dreams.

If her work hours are getting in the way of your relationship, that’s a conversation you should have. But if she comes straight home to you, it’s clear she doesn’t have time to cheat."
195,"Regarding time and addiction. At this point he doesn't admit it's an addiction or a problem. OP can ask him to sit down with her and go through the hours of his week. Count up how many are spent on video games, vs how many are spent with her. Then ask him which he -wants- to prioritize. Are video games 10x more important than his wife. Does he want to change the way he spends his time? 

This will help change the way he thinks. It's one thing to schedule date nights and that will help remind him that wife is important. But he needs to really recognize the time management problem and address his thought patterns because right now yes he is an addict"
196,"Besides the cheating he’s also terrible with money, those are probably the two big things that make relationships not work out."
197,Me three! Going through a breakup now as well and need to move out soon. Maybe we should team up with OP and get a 3 bedroom 😂 Cheap rent for everyone!!
198,"I'm, uh, a little confused to say the least about all the fire and brimstone here. I don't understand why she didn't just say ""no, I am wearing my glasses,"" and I also don't understand why she considers this a decision that's final. They have nothing to do with that decision, and it's not like she has to go along with it now."
199,"&gt;She laughed and said men are like pets, they don't understand such things unless you train them. I asked her why would you marry a pet

&amp;#x200B;

You are an amazing person with a bright future ahead of you. Also, you just made my day with this comeback. xD"
200,"Talk to the girl who keeps inviting him, and let her know you're not into it. Either explain that the get together is meant to be a girls-only thing, or the honest truth, that his behaviour makes the evening less fun for some of you. If she doesn't listen then next time you meet up, don't invite either of them. 

If that starts to decrease numbers at your outings, it doesn't sound like that would be the worst thing in the world. Personally I'd always prefer to hang out with one person I like being around than a medium-large sized group that included someone like this, and people who enjoy(???) spending time with someone that painfully annoying and insecure. "
201,"Please just break up with him. You two are incompatible. He didn't date her because she is out of his league and she would not have gone out with him. He didn't pick you because he loves you.  He picked you because he is afraid of rejection.

Sorry to be so blunted but this is the naked truth."
202,"Shit, tell him Reddit is proud of him. Full-time parenting on top of full-time classes and actually graduating in less than 2 years is a *hell* of an accomplishment. He’s clearly incredibly driven. 

Don’t force him to attend graduation (let’s be honest, graduations are a slog no matter what degree you’re getting), but *do* have a special day to celebrate his accomplishment. Get him flowers, pop some bubbly and make just enough of a fuss to make him feel appreciated. A heartfelt card would mean the world to him. He’s likely still going to feel a bit weird about the education gap between him and his family members, but the family *you* made with him already thinks he’s great. And that matters. "
203,"Welp, this is beautiful and amazing."
204,Why would this person anonymously message your sister and not you directly?  That part sticks out as strange to me.
205,"Your husband is abusive, OP, and you need to get out. If you can't do this for yourself, consider the fact that as your daughter grows, your husband will start doing the things he does to you to *her.*

Your daughter will learn that any mistake - even the smallest - is met with terrifying anger, yelling, and that *it's her fault.*

Your daughter will learn that any attempt to assert her own opinion will be met with terrifying anger, yelling, and that her opinion is *wrong*, always wrong. (How will this prepare her for sexual attention from men as she gets older? What lessons will she learn about her right and the safety of saying 'no'?)

Your husband will pin her against furniture and walls when she 'disobeys'.

Your daughter will learn, through your own example, that it is good and right for her to sacrifice her safety, her comfort, her self-esteem, and her opinions in service to fixing angry, broken men. That she is bad and selfish if she wants to have a relationship that doesn't look like yours."
206,"It really sounds like this woman has been grooming you. You need to speak to your parents, establish legal rights to your child and avoid this woman except as necessary to care for the baby. "
207,"The idea that you are abused takes some getting used to. 

""But she doesn't hit me"" is not enough. 

-  psychological abuse is happening

- financial abuse (yes, that's a thing) is happening, i.e. lack of financial independence

- abusive isolation and control is happening (no car, no friends, far from family)

- she's cheating. Don't wait for ""and now she's given me an STD so nobody else will want me"""
208,This is everything I wish I could have said to him from the beginning! He is 100% submissive to her and it will end in her nuking our friendship but at this point if he can’t stand up to her then maybe I should let it happen. :(
209,"You👏need👏to👏leave👏him👏 
From what you’ve described he is gas lighting the situation (look up gas lighting). You are not the reason any of this is happening to him. You are not to blame. Get the hell out of that situation before it escalates even more. "
210,He's married to his mom. You can just see your way out because any one that's more interested in masturbation and mom than anything else isn't worth your time and energy. 
211,"You need to work on your insecurities before they end up pushing this guy away. Trust me, if this guy only cared about being with you when you wear make up and contacts, you wouldn't want to be with him anyway. 

You're not catfishing anyone. I'm sure he realizes that you wear make up and it won't be a big deal that you wear glasses (a lot of people do). 

I'm sure that you really don't look that bad without makeup and with your glasses on. The right person will find you beautiful no matter what. But, you need to work on yourself and your insecurities before they become a self-fulfilling prophecy that kills any chances you have with this guy. "
212,"yep, doing it while you were out of the house involves planning and decisions to do that sexual act while you're away.

"
213,"People in this comment section are jumping down your wife’s throat but you didn’t even actually say what’s she doing currently that is causing you to post here. 

You say you *had* to take care of her when she was injured for months. You say you started feeling like her parent while taking care of her. You say it’s 14 months since the injury and she is fully healed now. She’s been healed for months, so what is she doing NOW that’s making you feel this way? Is she still expecting a lot of you? Is she back to normal but you still have leftover feelings of resentment? 

I really think you need to clarify or you’re going to get nothing except comments degrading your wife about her recovery time from armchair medical experts. "
214,"In any other situation, I would say no big deal. Parents get crazy when they think about their kids doing non-kid-like stuff, especially if they think someone might be taking advantage of them. 

HOWEVER, you're saying your GF's dad BEAT her last time he believed she was sexually active. That means there is a real and present danger to her. Her parents may also try to get you labelled as a sex offender due to the difference in your ages if they are as crazy as you say (although in most states they will have no legal grounds).

Make sure your girlfriend has a way to contact you and/or the police if she is in trouble, and make sure she knows that it is wrong and abusive for her dad to hit her and she should call the police if he tries. 

Are there any trusted adults you could involve that would support the two of you without alerting your GF's parents? Teachers are probably required to contact your GF's parents--could you involve your own parents while downplaying the messages themselves?"
215,"No, his not having a girlfriend is NOT causing him to be misogynistic and racist - that's 100% on him. "
216,"Time to talk about it with your fiancee. She is not doing anyone any favors by not setting boundaries with this man. I'm no expert, but from what I understand, you need to be VERY clear and direct with boundaries when working with mentally disabled people. Not only is your fiancee not helping Harold here by not setting these boundaries, she is also completely disregarded and ignoring your feelings here as well. Like, why does she care more about Harold's feelings than the feelings of the man she wants to spend her life with? It may be time to go to couples counseling about this if you talking to her about it isn't changing anything. 

Nowhere in what I read makes it seem like your fiancee is any sort of expert in working with disabled people. Imo, she is putting herself in a dangerous position by continuing to enable this man and unless she starts setting boundaries with him, I would be very worried tbh. "
217,"I knew bullet point #5 was coming by bullet point #2

As far as I am concerned, there's bullet point #5 (""I've rekindled things with an old flame..."") and then some others to (a) rationalize the decision she's already made and (b) attempt to soften your reaction to (a).

Spectrum or not, I'd be talking to my lawyer pronto."
218,She missed her cousin but the cousin was coming with her? Bullshit. You don't ask someone a favour and then make them sit around for hours while you fuck around and lie to them multiple times. 
219,"Yeah I thought the pet thing was weird. She said something similar before.

I'm going to take your advice and just apologize for talking badly about her engagement."
220,"It always sucks. I've never had a breakup that didn't suck. But I'm older now, happily married, and there's not one breakup I look back on and regret, because they all paved the way for current me. You're going through the tough stuff now so that future you can be happy and fulfilled. So tell yourself ""you're welcome, future me"" and push on. It will be ok. "
221,"&gt;It's April fools so I'm considering giving her a taste of her own medicine and breaking up with her as a prank because that would be the easiest thing to do without hurting her feelings. Any advice or alternatives would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is that hurting your partner to teach them a lesson is not a healthy approach to relationships. "
222,"This is 100% abuse. 

It’s better to be from a broken home than grow up in one. Get your daughter out of there and go for as much custody as the legal system will grant you, because if you stay, she will be messed up badly. "
223,"This is an emotionally abusive relationship and it’s just not a healthy place for you to be. He showed his true colors very early on by cheating on you yet he blames you for his abhorrent behavior ever since. 

When someone shows you who they are believe them. Reach out to your friends and family for support and start making plans to get out. "
224,"If you want to stay with him (despite his...ah...assholishness) then I guess you should turn down the job.

But HOLY FUCK please do not do this. Accept the job and throw the entire boyfriend in the trash where any partner that acts like this belongs. "
225,"I read the whole post and you're going to have to talk to her. There's literally nothing anyone can tell you about your wife, with any truth or certainty. Look how many years you've been married and you don't even know. We're not going to get you to answers by reading a couple of paragraphs. If she is avoiding something so are you. Now go talk it out, you have children and lives on the line."
226,"I wouldn’t just come out and say it to her. Just don’t wear the shoes next time and if she comments on your height you can just say “oh that’s probably because of my lift shoes” or something like that. If you make it a big deal, she might take it as a big deal. And if your height is a problem for her, then she’s just not the right one for you. "
227,"Your husband doesn't understand how birth control works.

Solutions:

1. Educate him - take him to a doctor or pharmacist and get them to explain it to him. 

2. Freeze embryos with him to use later.  I guess that might also 'poison' them in his mind. 

3. Use birth control and just don't tell him.  What he doesn't know won't hurt him in this case.  I wouldn't suggest lying to him though,  that's probably not healthy.  

"
228,"I work in HR. Not sure how your Hr works but I'd expect any one of my employees would be at my desk the moment I walked in the next morning to talk. 

On a personal note I am so sorry you are going through this- not once but twice. I had similar experiences which ultimately probably got me into my profession to protect others. If you would like some additional HR perspective, please feel free to PM me "
229,"It's crazy levels of gaslighting. She's trying to convince OP he didn't actually date her for their entire relationship, and they have always just been friends with benefits. For two years! That is pure insanity."
230,"Ok his confession seems to be somewhat truthful. But why would someone go to all this trouble to make an account just to message your sister this now, a decade later? 

If he has made arrangements with prostitutes while in a relationship he's probably smart enough to immediately delete any evidence, hence why he may have been comfortable offering his phone over right away.

Something just seems fishy.

Have you considered messaging the fake Facebook back and ask for evidence? "
231,"...it kind of feels more along the lines that you're the one with the stability issues. You started hanging out with her and her boyfriend, you invited them over to your place, and you're the one who decided you didn't want to continue it, so you continue going to the place you KNOW she works and then say she's ""bullying"" you for asking when you guys will be free again? You were a ""nervous wreck"" before plans YOU made so you canceled? Jeeeeeeesus dude"
232,"Yeah, somehow the fact that it's a ""game"" and the behavior is new (at least compared to ancient addictions, like alcohol) makes people take it less seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can't make it to a toilet...you got a problem."
233,"Honestly, what is the point of telling her, other then to unburden yourself and burden her? She has never had interest in romance, nor in dating you, and has always been highly religious, so her devoting herself to her religion seems to be a natural progression for her. You risk making your friendship with her very awkward and uncomfortable. Frankly, considering you haven't been alone since you were sixteen, I'd say you finding out who you are outside of a relationship is more important then trying to pursue something with someone who has bigger fish to fry."
234,"&gt;Last weekend I was out of town from Friday to Sunday. On Saturday her male friend and her went out for drinks, then he ended up spending the night at our house with her.

I feel like you already know the answer."
235,"I’m going to strongly disagree with the people telling you to try to contact her back. You want **nothing** to do with this. You have no idea if this woman is unstable, vengeful, or what. 

I think you should go to HR so that you can cover your own ass from false allegations, but at the very least you should let your coworker know that his wife called you and accused you of having an affair with him. If she starts harassing you more, you need to be prepared to go to HR (or potentially the police). "
236,Just tell them you're not interested in anything more than being platonic friends the first time a boundary is crossed for you. whatever that boundary is for you. If they continue then you'll need to distance and you can tell them that their behavior has caused you to rethink the closeness relationship and it's healthier for both of you to have some distance.  
237,"My response would be that you’re doing a disservice to her and her kids if you cave in. She’s going through the anger stage in the grieving process and she needs to work through it on her own, or preferably with a therapist. You capitulating will just convince her that she was right. 

It sounds like the heart of her anger is that she thought modern medicine had cured everything, and it’s scary to know it hasn’t. Maybe this is the first time she’s faced death in such a personal way, where there wasn’t another party at fault. It’s important for her to say right now that a person had to been at fault, these things just don’t happen on their own.

Of course, it didn’t just happen without cause and there was a person at fault: her father. Even though she knew his faults while he was living, in death she can’t bring herself to accept that he is the one who has caused her this pain. But it’s so important that she does, because it’s a lesson for her children: you need to take care of yourself, you need to go to a doctor when you’re unwell. But she’s teaching them the opposite, that going to a doctor will kill them.

All you really can do is tell your brother in law that he needs to insist on therapy, for their children’s sake."
238,"Just stop having Grandma babysit. Have your friend babysit since she's happy to do it while you look into preschool options. Since she refuses payment, pick her up, bring her to your place and drive her home. Make sure her favorite snacks, drinks etc are on  tap. Let husband deal with grandma"
239,"&gt; He also cried and said that he feels like the dog is the only thing keeping him from committing suicide and he ""needs"" the dog. 

Not to mention what a slap in the face is to his children. Jesus. He really has checked out of the family if he’s at this point. "
240,"Yeah, he might be trickle-truthing her."
241,"You didn't marry a man, you married a child who happened to be living in a man's body.  He went from having one mom taking care of him (the one who birthed him) to having another one (you).

People do what they want.  Every single time.  If he wanted to be different from how he is, he either *would* be different, or he would be taking the steps necessary to *become* different.  But he's not.  Because he *wants* to continue to be a child and have you provide for him.

Never cling to a mistake simply because you've spent a long time making it.

Your mom is right.  Pack a bag and leave.

And no matter *what* you do, *do not have children with him*."
242,"&gt;I think our relationship just sucks. I honestly think the whole relationship is garbage and we are only together because of our child. I want to break up.


This is really all that matters, OP.  You don't owe that man anything.  Is he threatening you?  If not, who cares if all he wants is someone to take his shit everyday?  He can find someone else."
243,"This is such a strange mix of ""how did you not already know this?"" And ""why are you not setting better boundaries?""

So... um...  how did you not know a lot of this stuff already? Did she always come to your place? Did you assume that how she was on visits was the same as how she lives? Did you guys not talk about this stuff?

And how come you aren't doing the stuff you want to do with her there?  Go where you want, listen to audiobooks, get a split bed if you need to?  Yes, living with someone entails a fair amount of negotiation. Perhaps an LDR suited you for 4 years because you only had to compromise/negotiate brief visits? In which case, buckle up, because you either have to change or not live together."
244,I think part of the problem is that they don’t really understand what I do and think I more or less wipe butts all day. Nurses are in high demand in my area and there has been some media coverage on the nursing shortage. From their comments I gather they think I may as well wipe butts in another hospital. 
245,"Wait, so HE invites you to do things, and you never reciprocate? This changes things - YOU distanced yourself from him. He's not distanced himself from you. You're projecting, man. He doesn't ""PLAY a good sport"" at family gatherings - he IS a good sport. You're the one who's pulled away. He tries to connect with you, invites you to do things, and you never return the favor. If he doesn't invite you more often, it's because he doesn't want to impose - since you never initiate contact, he probably assumes you only accept his invitations out of obligation, so he doesn't burden you with too many. So invite him to do something, and see what happens. You don't even need to have a big old heart-to-heart, just invite him to golf or whatever it is you do, and have a fun brotherly time. Then build on that. 

You're original post made it seem like he doesn't want much to do with you, but now I think you're just projecting, that from his perspective, it's YOU who doesn't want much to do with HIM, since you never reciprocate his invitations."
246,Wait so... What was with the anonymous tip saying he was cheating on you with prostitutes? 
247,"Exactly. Thank you, this is all spot on. It sucks because I'll be taking to her about something as insignificant as helping my son with his homework, but I'm smiling and feeling good because I got to help him and that's one of our things. Then she makes a comment and totally derails my happiness and replaces it with resentment towards her (GF not ex). I do need to nip this in the butt (I know) "
248,"no offense, but your husband sounds like the kind of person who would be an anti-vaxxer. "
249,"If you still date her, against your parent's will, what would they do to you?"
250,"Girl if you're serious message me, we'll combine resources and find rooms for all!"
251,"Probably demonstrating Freya had to be off of her medication for longer than you were home (ie. she had to have fallen before you got back). But you should see if this blows over first, the more you try to justify yourself to your family, the more you'll look guilty. So don't JADE. A more complicated defense should only come up if they press charges, and you have a lawyer. 

  
You should also consider spending less time with your parents who don't seem to much care about your well being. "
252,"Formerly overweight person here.  There's not much you can do to convince someone to take control of their health until they make that decision themselves.  I assure you she knows she's gained weight and that it's an issue, but for whatever reason she hasn't had the will to start changing her habits yet.  You can suggest healthier eating and exercise all you want but if she's not in the right mindset she'll find ways to continue her bad habits when you're not around.  It's probably not what you wanted to hear but she has to make the decision for herself."
253,"Even just a year ago, I thought I’d get something cool to represent my bf of five years. He liked fishing so I thought a fly or something with a cool design would be neat. I had the same though, even if we break up we will still be friends and I’ll want to remember everything that happened in our lives together. We talked about that a lot, how if we ever broke up we’d still be so close and talk all the time. I asked him and he liked the idea, even said he’d get something for me too. We never did but fast forward we’ve broken up and been basically no contact three months and boy can I not believe how wrong I really was. Things just don’t work out the way you think they will and I’m so glad I never went through with it. "
254,"No. That kid is being disrespectful as hell after you've treated him like a grown up by asking and talking to him. 
"
255,"That hurts like hell to hear, but that would make a lot of sense. "
256,"Just cut contact. You won't be able to move on if you don't. You guys are gonna keep hanging, msging, creeping his profiles, etc if you don't which will make it more difficult to get over your feelings. Cut contact and don't look back. He led you on and kissed you and then says he wants to be just friends. Cuttinf contact is the only way to go."
257,"I can't even imagine how an argument about this would go.  If anyone says anything Claire can just respond with ""What the fuck?  Are you fucking serious?  I can't tell, really.  Are you being fucking serious?  Are you?""  

"
258,"&gt; When we left the scene, my wife went ballistic. She was screaming in my ear the entire drive home, because she was ""tired from work,"" and was calling me all sorts of names and punching my car. She called me a fucking asshole, and a piece of shit who never cares about what she wants, and that I never listen to her, and that I should have just minded my own fucking business instead of being a rubber necking busy body.

If this is normal, your marriage is horribly abusive. If this is not normal, then there's something terribly wrong with your wife."
259,"This right here! 
My thought exactly, but OP you can try and bring it up. Not sure what would change except if he does go and pay once in a while it might be because he feels obligated? To me the actions say it all. "
260,You're bi. Me and my boyfriend are both bi. We still love one another. You can be attracted to other people of any gender while still being in love with your boyfriend. It's not this complicated
261,"&gt;My husband never yelled at me, let alone was physically violent prior to marriage. After the birth of our son he punched me in the arm 

Here is a horrible secret about abusive men: some of them can pretend for years (through dating, engagement) to be nice, normal people, until they ""lock down"" their partner. 

After the wedding, or after the baby's born, the abuse starts because now the victim can't so easily. You're married so you're legally tied to him -- you own a house together or signed a lease so you have nowhere to go -- you had his kid, so now you're going to be tied together for 18+ years."
262,I can email them today. I'm not sure what to say except to attach the text conversation and ask to speak about it in person Monday because I'm disgusted by what my boss said... Would that be a good email?
263,"""I'd love to renew, I would be adding another person to the lease if I do. What would the additional cost be?"" You don't need to tell him anything  else unless you really want him to know about your relationship. Do it in writing (email is better than text) so he can't change the amount later. "
264,"&gt;Thanks for keeping me honest and checking in about that stuff.

And if you can keep checking in with him, and making sure he hits all three of those points, you'll be doing him a service.  If you care about this man, and you do, then you want him to get into therapy.  Because, it will help him.  And if your relationship continues long into the future, that helps you too.  And if it doesn't, you've left a partner in better condition than you found them in, which is a great goal to have with everyone you know."
265,"&gt; I shouldn't even care.

Oh, I disagree. You absolutely should care; the fact that this bothers you means you have a decent moral compass."
266,"I'm sorry. This sounds like a horrible and scary situation. But. that's not your boyfriend any more, he's just too much of a coward to actually break up with you. You can try to bring it up by text or whatever, but please note he won't even go to the gym with you and puts off seeing you and isn't really talking to you. He's showing you who his first priority is &amp; it isn't you. "
267,"&gt;He admitted that the plan was to ask her out during our break but he never worked up the courage. 

&gt;After a long conversation it came out that he thinks she’s hotter than me but he loves me and chooses me.

So he's full of shit, it sounds like? He was going to use your break to cheat on you, he didn't have the nerve to follow through, but oh it's okay because he's ""choosing you""? No, he's told you he wants to cheat on you, he's just bad at it.

You're dealing with stress from other sources and your relationship is giving you more stress instead of making the rest easier to deal with. It sounds like you'd be better off without this guy."
268,I'm really concerned that you think it would have been abusive for you to tell him that you didn't want him having sex with someone else.
269,A year and a half is a relationship.
270,"Actually what he is saying is that he doesn’t what to marry OP. 

That’s truly crappy for you OP but try to remember that’s not a reflection of the awesome person you are. You deserve someone excited to spend the rest of their life with you. He is just not that guy. It seems like the relationship is ok for him for know but he knows (and is telling you) he won’t marry you. "
271,"She's an idiot, you'll find better."
272,Have you told him clearly that the relationship ship is done and you want a divorce? Have you reported his threats? I definitely don't think you should go back to him. He sounds manipulative and awful.
273,"/r/ surviving infidelity is better suited for this 

 there was a great comment though from someone on that sub about this sorta thing:

Waywards and modern society believes that cheating is a single point in time. This is completely and utterly false.

Infidelity causes trauma. It overwhelms the limbic system where the flight or fight reactions are produced. When you find out about cheating all sense of safety and security in the relationship is gone. You have found out that your partner who was supposed to have your back, has allowed an enemy inside the gates. In reality it is a physical, emotional, and mental attack on you.

When cheating is found out it rips the reality that the betrayed had shreds the past is now incomplete. The betrayed is faced with having to paste history back together and paste in the new information about the cheating and the outside relationship. 

What exacerbates the situation is most waywards continue to hide information which then gets delivered in small pieces. Each time a new truth is discovered the wounds are opened again and any progress that has been made can be partially or completely lost.

When cheating is found out it drains the relationship of all of the invested innocent trust that was given at the very beginning. This is why the waywards words have no meaning. This is why actions are needed in order for the betrayed to know if what the wayward says what they mean. They can talk all they want and it means little until you see them put those words into action.

Healing timeline for this shit storm is 2-5 years. Not months, not days. It takes this long because your wayward will have to work her ass off in order to prove that she isn't going to do this again.
What your wife wants to do is to forgive, forget, and move on. Here is the problem with this.

You can never forget this because it happened. It touches everything in the relationship. It is something very hard for the wayward to get their head around because they don't experience the traumatic effects of discovery that you do. There may be some trauma on their end but not on the scale or depth that the betrayed feel. This is why the wayward must develop **EMPATHY**.

You can't forgive what you don't know about. As long as there are questions about who, what, where when, how and there are still holes in the past, you will still deal with this. This is why full **disclosure**, full** transparency**, and full **accountability** are required for healing.

There is no moving on from infidelity. I use the term **MOVE THRU**.

Moving through infidelity means that it gets dealt with. This means the betrayed gets the information they need to figure out what really happened. This means that the wayward does work on themselves to try to figure out what the fuck allowed them to make the decisions to have an affair which means figuring out what I term the **Deep Whys**.  The wayward must be able to build an environment where the safety and security of the betrayed is the priority.

I have typed a shit ton of words here and I am going to cut and past this list from How to Help Your Spouse Heal From Your Affair by Linda McDonald.

**In order to to help me heal from the infidelity my wife must...**

my wife must be non defensive

my wife must examine her motives for her affairs, without blaming me.

my wife must accept her role as healer to me.

my wife must not resist breaking off all contact with the affair partner

my wife must show genuine contrition and remorse for what she has done

my wife must make amends and apologize to loved ones

my wife must apologize often to me, **especially the first two years**

my wife must listen with patience and validate their my pain

my wife must allow me a lot of room to express my feelings

my wife must respect my timetable for recovering

my wife must seek to assure me of her love and commitment to fidelity

my wife must keep no secrets

my wife must not maintain close ties with those who condoned the affair

my wife must be extremely accountable for her time and activities

my wife must frequently check in with me as to how I'm doing

my wife must be aware of and anticipate triggers of the affair

my wife must be willing to get rid of hurtful reminders of the affair

my wife must not minimize the damage the affair had on our children (if any)

my wife must commit herself to a long-term plan for recovery, honesty, and Internal (Spiritual) growth

**The last point includes these actions: (I added these from my own experience)**

Individual counseling for the wayward so they can find out what is inside them that allowed them to rationalize the affair.

Learning what constitutes safe boundaries in interpersonal relationship.

Couples counseling once the wayward finds those whys and begins addressing them, and acceptance 100% of the affair is on the wayward (no blame shifting)


"
274,"For the 15 year old in the conversation, she certainly did. 

Well, if what she says is accurate. I’m sure it’s a bit colored to her perspective. "
275,"You say you've already decided to leave, so *talk to a lawyer first*. Figure out what your options are and how to get out of this marriage as well as you possibly can, and then follow your lawyer's advice."
276,"Ex cam girl here, please leave him. Most the men on those sites are deplorable. I was often told how much prettier I am than their wives, which is why I had to stop camming. I know it can be hard to leave a toxic relationship, but do you girl. Get a hobby to focus on this energy on and leave this guy! Good luck girlie."
277,"Absolute best thing.

OP apologise for saying the F word. Whatever it’s minor. But then say new rule. Shower for X mins. After that water is turned off, disable WiFi usage and take away phone. You shouldn’t have to turn the water off. Once will be enough for him to learn."
278,"Dude, what you are describing is so abnormal that there can't be any reasonable explanation for it (unless you are leaving out some major details). Good, normal parents do not confine their sons in a house, isolate them from their peers, and treat them so extremely differently from their other children. It sounds like your parents are abusive, though it may be weird to think of them that way. What would happen if you disobeyed them and left the house, made friends, and pursued your own life?

Regardless, you are never going to get those high school years back and are on track to lose your college years as well. A major part of having those experiences is being with people your own age. A 19 or 20 year old doesn't belong in class with 14 and 15 year olds. He belongs in college or trade school or in a job. 

Do whatever it takes to get your GED, and decide what you need to do in order to be independent. If you need money, get a job and start at community college. If you have money, decide what kind of education you want and go for it. "
279,"Fucking hell, everything you said makes sense but I want you to be wrong so bad. And everyone else too. Like fuck, I can't be in an abusive relationship, that's crazy. That's just something that happens to other people and girls on TV "
280,"I don’t get it, he didn’t cheat on you, so what’s the problem?"
281,"We are not an example, but I like to think I learn a lot from reading advice here. Ultimately is how you communicate right?   
Also he's a champ and really took it upon himself to better his adult life skills. "
282,"Or this sub’s favorite analogy: the dog poo sandwich. 

“This sandwich is great except for the layer of dog shit in the middle. But I can manage.”  No. Don’t manage. Get a different sandwich. "
283,Dump him. Let their mom know you're out while you're at it. But this dude will drown you in debt and depression if you stay. 
284,This. And you really shouldn't use other's life milestones to track yours to keep pace. 
285,Dead serious. I’ll PM you 
286,"So what, you want some poor girl to sacrifice herself to the cause of ""fixing"" your brother?   
He needs to be separated from the communities which are reinforcing his beliefs and he needs therapy. "
287,"Obviously since your boyfriend is an incredibly selfish jerk, you should move out on your own and pursue your dreams.

Never, ever pass up important career moves for a partner, especially when they refuse to make even the tiniest sacrifice for you. "
288,"I’m glad to hear you got this all resolved! I think how you handled it with your boss and your co-worker was smart, and it’s nice to know that in regards to the co-worker they already knew a bit of what was going on. Keep your head up, you got this! "
289,"To be honest it sounds like you are both making a bunch of small bad choices that really add up.

Why do you need to be done work by the time the kids get home from school, if their dad is home and not working?  Why do you need be done work to cook dinner if their dad is home and not working?  

Let your partner do the morning routine with the kids.  Let him handle the after schools, let him cook 3 weeknights, giving you longer to work.  In exchange, you free up a block of time daily to spend with him while the kids are at school, and give the kids your full attention after dinner.  Find a counselor.  Get your partner handling bills and finances alongside you - so he sees where the money is at, understands why he can't just buy something, knows why you are so stressed, and why he should find work if the May job doesn't work out.  Read Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski, ideally with your partner, and strengthen that part of your relationship too. "
290,"Seems like he’s been saying that, but no one is listening. 

About time he snapped, make the kid know that he’s not fucking around. Wait for him to leave, take it earlier, or take a 10 minute shower, no if ands or buts. 

OP I think you didn’t do anything wrong, a one time flip when you’re not being respected can help you lay down the law "
291,It’s a pain in the ass but yup I’d do it she will get the hint real quick 
292,"Think of it this way: your boyfriend was so embarrassed because he assumes you were grossed out about something he did.  If he knew that you were actually turned on, you could take all his embarrassment away and make him feel better!  All you have to say is, ""remember what happened a couple weeks ago when we were having sex?  I know you were kind of embarrassed but I wanted to let you know that I actually got turned on when it happened, which surprised me.""  You don't need to make that first conversation a huge conversation about whether you expect him to participate in your kink, etc. "
293,After 5+ hours of repeatedly lying and saying she was on the way!
294,"The getting someone else a gift thing gets to me.

I think this guy, whether he's been burned personally or just reads too many men's right's forums, thinks that some large portion of women are only after a man's money.

That fits the fact pattern - he doesn't buy things for you, insisting on going dutch each time. He knows that you're making less money than he is. He's not actually cheap, just with you.

It's not necessarily the only possibility, I just wanted to raise it because it could portend toxic interactions in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

For your own sake, you need to figure out where you see this relationship going. To find out if there's an incompatibility here, or just a miscommunication, you'll need to lay out your own intentions &amp; expectation to yourself, and then speak to him directly about the things that are out of line with those expectations."
295,"Jesus, I genuinely don't know how I'd come back from that. I think if there's any chance of salvaging this you guys need couples counseling and I would also recommend individual counseling regardless to deal with the blow this dealt to your self-esteem.

I don't think anyone would blame you if this ended the relationship (not just because of him not finding you attractive but giving you a cruel nickname?????? Wow). Just know that your life is far from having been wasted and you have plenty good years to spend with someone else if you choose not to continue this marriage."
296,"Google Maps might help you here. Click “Your Timeline” from the menu, and it will show your locations throughout the day. If your property is large enough for someone to “go exploring” on, then it’s large enough for Google to catch whether you were by the ledge or not at the time of the incident.

That’s for the first part of your question. But for the second—how do you prove you’re not the kind of person to do that? First, go on the offense. 

I’d  print that timeline map out and put it all over the family home, making sure *everyone* your aunt and uncle saw it. Then, I’d put them on noice that cousin, aunt, and uncle are slandering you, and if you don’t get a public apology, you will: 1) file a defamation lawsuit for slander, and 2) contact the police for harassment.

Your family—including your parents—sound pretty terrible, OP. YMMV, but this isn’t something I would forgive them for."
297,This sounds like it’d be an episode of Seinfeld with a George Costanza subplot
298,"Just curious, do you know if this person is actually related to your BF or is it a euphemism for close family friend?"
299,Nah cause his phone will disconnect from wifi but won't tell him which means he'll be using data which will probably be on the whole family's data and now both your water and data are gone
300,"Many partners find other people hotter, many people have crushes. Many people manage not to cheat despite this. It's not hard! Besides, if he's dissatisfied with his current relationship he has the option to leave. As you note, his reasons for cheating are utter bullshit. But having called him out on it, move on. He justified his actions, minimized his actions, attempted to avoid being called out for his actions. He's not going to change.

You're not a terrible friend, you've only established a few reasons why he's not a great person to be friends with."
301,"I'll admit I've been guilty in the past of discussing penis size, with my *very best friend* in absolute confidence. 

The fact that she was talking about it with a guy she's not even overly close with is a huge red flag. "
302,"She thought you would say no but Steve would say yes and that this ""proof"" of him caring more about her than you would fissure your marriage enough that she can get a chance with your husband. "
303,Thank you. Yeah I’m in denial I think and seriously traumatized so the option of working through it is probably delusional. I appreciate your words 
304,"Ok, I do want to ask again because it will change my advice: are they actively preventing you from leaving - in other words, will they physically bar you from leaving the house - or are they indirectly preventing you from leaving by denying you access to money for transportation, etc?


You should call adult protective services for whatever city you live in. Tell them that you're a vulnerable adult and that you need help getting out of your parents' home. See what they can do.


Reach out to the high school that's offered you the credits. Ask them for help. There will definitely be a counselor or mandated reporter there who can connect you with social services. 


Finally, remember that you are legally an adult. Your parents do not have legal control over you. They cannot force you to do anything, or not to do anything - their power is in making it difficult for you to access the resources your need to become independent. That is a significant power, for sure, but remember it is the only power they have."
305,"""Hi \[air bnb host\], it seems like we keep trying to do laundry at the same time and I've noticed that my clothes have been stopped mid cycle while they're in the dryer and put into a basket, which normally means they get a mildew smell and I have to wash them all over again. Can we work out a laundry schedule since I'll be here a few more months? I'd had for our wires to keep crossing on the subject and I prefer to be the only individual handling my laundry."""
306,"A quick googling turned up this on diabetics in some sort of low blood sugar moment:

&gt; Individuals with diabetes may struggle with various symptoms caused by high or low blood sugar. High blood sugars tend to cause depressive feelings and mood swings, while low blood sugar may cause scattered thoughts while **extreme lows can even cause hallucinations and delusional thinking.** 

Combine that with a life-long program of despising OP and it's not hard to see how this could have come about.

Also, OP your parents are shitty.  They've had an entire lifetime of observation to know the score.  That they don't makes them shitty.  Sorry."
307,"I’m passive, I hate confrontation so I know why OP is having a hard time. 

I would put a jingle bell or some sound/alarm on the door and when SIL sets it off I would act surprised and say I had installed it to teach the “ kids” boundaries....then promptly ask her what she needed? Hopefully the embarrassment alone will make her never try your doors again. 

I did this with my medicine cabinet and a nosy family member. I rigged everything to fall out of the medicine cabinet when opened...hasn’t happened when that relative has come back since :) 

OR, you could be an “adult” and just straight out tell her not cool... beauty is the choice is yours. Best of luck! "
308,"You've been dating for years but never knew that she sleeps until noon or can't sleep with(or without?) an audiobook on or how soft she likes her bed? It's not natural for this stuff to be such a surprise. I mean, you do learn some things when you move in together, but I'm confused as to why things seem to be such news to you after 4 years? She wasn't always sort of looking to you for entertainment before? 

I'll be honest- no this isn't just a normal thing that happens when couples move in. When I moved in with my partner it wasn't like living with a roommate, it was like living with an extension of myself. If I need alone time, I just tell him and go retreat to my room. You should talk to her and also break up "
309,"&gt;“well your lucky I don’t spend my time out drinking”

My ex used to say exactly the same thing. I would get on him about spending literally DAYS working on and executing D&amp;D campaigns for his friends interspersed with every other waking minute being glued to a computer screen playing WOW.  He would get angry aggressive about how ""Other guys are out at bars getting drunk every night so you should be thankful!"" Like my choices in partners are limited to game addicts or raging alcoholics - thats all that exists folks.  


Spoiler alert, my exDuH is now an EX because he never stopped playing long enough to adult, get a job, or pay for 50% (ha ha like 10% tops) of the bills. It was literally like pulling teeth with him until the very end when I rage quit and threw the controller THEN he wanted to change...."
310,Beautifully put. Who does the gf think she is that she has any right to an opinion in this? Plus the fact that she's mad at her bf for protecting his cousin from a potential predator is disturbing.
311,"\&gt;  **We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I turned into a heart-eyes emoji when I  read this. "
312,"You're right. I shouldn't talk him out it. I feel guilty though, for being relieved that he put me first and them second. 

I was afraid he made his choice when his emotions were high, that's why I told him not do anything he might regret at the time. I'm believer that you don't make drastic choices when you're upset, angry or depressed but now the anger has passed and I see that he meant it. I just wish it didn't make him feel worse. "
313,"Him keeping silent on this issue for a while and then blurting out the problem but not offering solutions or further conversation isn't a good sign. I think you should talk to him about how you two, together, can spice up your sex life. "
314,"Hahaha! Such a funny joke. Trying to cheat to pass the time. 

The fact that he is completely downplaying it is very cruel. Get out of this marriage. "
315,He told you he didn't want to go out (with you) and then went out when you were asleep.  He focused his attention on this woman instead of you when you went hiking. He tries to manipulate you by saying this is what people do normally. I hate to say this but it sounds as though he has a crush on her and he is hoping that she will reciprocate.  Your feelings are entirely natural and valid.
316,"Not all men cheat. Leave him, spend some time on your own and maybe see a therapist. If you really think that you deserve this treatment, you need to work on your self-esteem.

Being single and happy in your skin is so much better than being in an unhappy relationship with a cheating boyfriend.

You deserve better - don't tell yourself otherwise!"
317,"Lock the door. &lt;Shrug&gt; it's a quiet way of saying ""if you can't listen, we'll take measures"". If she brings it up, a simple ""why were you going into our bedroom anyway?"" is enough to signal you're not a fan of that tendency. "
318,"My husband has had two Acl/mcl/meniscus surgeries. He was up moving on crutches with in a couple days and he was putting some weight within a couple weeks. Yes the full recovery was 4-6 months, but he was doing everything for himself within a few days after surgery. Including getting to college classes, exams and crutching it all over campus. 

Looks like you need to sit down and have a chat with her. Yes it's not fun, but a marriage can't carry on as a parent child relationship and be healthy and successful.  You will need to be brave and sweetly explain to her where you are and how the two of you can work together to change this dynamic so that you both can be happy again.  

Good luck! "
319,"&gt; She’ll stay until like 8-9...She’ll raid my fridge and pantry and lay on my couch all day, rub her feet on my throw pillows and couch...She’ll be really loud and obnoxious

Look, this isn't all on her, you are allowing it. Stop answering the door and phone when she calls, or be upfront and say I don't want company. As far as the birthday party: text her and tell you heard through the grapevine that she isn't going to the wedding with E, and that you were planning on coming to the birthday party. ""I only invited very close friends and family, and I don't have room for another person. I'll call you when I'm ready to hang out again."""
320,"Your sister is an idiot. 

If you want to repair things with her, you could say you are sorry you upset her (which is true) without having to back down from your point of principle.

If you carry on being very vocal as you put it, then you will get (stupid) people's backs up. You may be right, but maybe bite your tongue for a few seconds before leaping in with your opinion. "
321,"Hi OP! 

I just wanted to let you know that I had the same condition. I shied away from intimacy for a long time because I was so embarrassed, but my partners were really understanding. So, first of all: THEY DO EXIST. You will find someone who sees you. That guy sounds very young and very small. I know it hurts now, but I promise that you are deserving of a partner who accepts you. He is the one that isn’t enough.

And, if you reach a point where you can get surgery, only do it if it will enhance your quality of life. I had a loving boyfriend who accepted me as I was when I had one, because I knew it would feel like a relief. 

Eventually, I saw a surgeon who specializes in reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients, and had a breast augmentation. It cost around 8K, and I have the faintest “double bubble” shadow, but i feel much more comfortable.

So essentially: you are more than your breasts, and there’s no “normal”; there’s YOU. If you want surgery eventually, do a bit of research, a bit of doctor shopping, and some saving - it might be more feasible than you think! 

Good luck OP!!"
322,"Also, do not have sex...don’t need a surprise pregnancy..."
323,"Holy shit, she did the ""can I ask Steve"" thing after you and your mom had an explicit talk about boundaries and her pushing them in your relationship?

No. Nooooooooooo no no. She's deliberately pushing where she can. This is a game to her, she doesn't think you're actually going to do anything to stop her. Frankly, she may not even care if she actually gets your husband in bed, she might just enjoy thr pursuit and the attention, even if it's negative.

Fuck that. She's toxic and not at all a friend. I'd be leery of any friend who knowingly sleeps with married men anyway, but to do that and then havr the absolute **gall** to push boundaries after you said she makes you feel uncomfortable...all because she can hide behind ""but I was just asking, I didn't do anything!"" 

God damn. Remove this cancer from your life. Every time she sends you a nude (who the fuck sends their friends nudes!?) she is putting the thought of her banging your husband into your mind. Deliberately. To fuck with you. No contact, and your family should honor that too."
324,"&gt;  he just won’t accept responsibility for this and I don’t know what to do. 

You know fully well what to do. You leave, for your own mental health and well-being."
325,"A woman could be insulted by that comment, but a gay man could also be insulted by that comment. Relationships involve emotional stuff. Is he saying that there is no 'emotional stuff' between him and his partner? Are they just friends with benefits? It's a stereotype that relationships between two men aren't really 'relationships' - it's just two horny dudes and there are no real feelings between them.  
I wouldn't fuss over the comment because it sounds like he just made a clumsy joke that could be taken either way. "
326,"If telling her once doesn't stop the problem, not letting her come over would be the second step.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell her the kids are fine to come over, but she's not allowed inside because of her unreasonable behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;"
327,"Two months isn’t FOREVER. If this was a couple of  years out maybe, maybe she’d have a point. But if she didn’t want to keep talking about it (within months of you finding out because she wasn’t going to tell you) she shouldn’t have fucked someone else! 

Godspeed man, and all the best. But please please realize how ridiculous her statements are. Your wife cheated on you and expects you to be over it in two months. That’s not how the rest of us live. It’s not how most of us would want to live, and you sound so used to it that you don’t see it. "
328,"Upvoted because sometimes we are all clueless. If everyone's first option was to politely talk to someone then a lot more issues would be solved without fights. 

Maybe the SIL is just a bit odd and doesn't realize what she is doing. She might appreciate being told how she is acting. "
329,"Hugs.
You’ve said this was it and I agree, good move. Hardest part can be a lack of closure when the relationship ends. What you can do...is have that closure with yourself by imagining and going through that conversation in your mind. Allow yourself to be thankful for the good times you had and allow yourself to remember (not holding grudges or getting pissed) that yeah, you broke up for the right reason.
I wouldn’t contact him further. Not to be mean but there isn’t anything to say or discuss. Go and live your best life! Spring is a beautiful time of the year to enjoy time outside, time with friends, hobbies, etc. "
330,"Threatening to burn the house down? Calling your mother? I’m getting an *extremely* narcissistic and threatening vibe here. Don’t go back, don’t even ever meet him alone again. You are away and safe, keep it that way. If you ever go back it will be so, so much worse, your life will be in danger. Please don’t."
331,Yikes. She's an amazing woman to be so willing to give so much to his kids. Dude should know how lucky he is to have found a woman who would be a great partner in raising and loving his kids. She should be with somebody who appreciates her giving and gives back.
332,Let her sulk. You did the right thing and it shouldn't be you apologizing. Good on you for standing up for your gf.
333,"The worst part is the repetitive fucking. 1 text from the cousins house that says ""Theres a problem with the plumbing. Its gonna be a while, but you're welcome to come here until we finish handling it. Sorry."" Accidents and unexpected things happen, but just grow up and be considerate about how you deal with it. "
334,"That's it. I couldn't figure it why he went out of his way to hurt her, but you're totally right."
335,"He’s being honest which is a good, it’s clearly weighing on his mind.
Now looking at what he has said, if he’s spending the week working/studying and then the weekend is taken up with relationship time, there’s not really a personal break. 
Leading up to the weekend he may be feeling guilty about wanting to really do something for himself (coding etc) which could come through in his attitude over the weekend, which could break him down over time and possibly build resentment.
The flip side is the same could happen for you.
You want to spend time together, he wants to do his own thing, which can make one certainly feel pushed away, eventually also leading to resentment.
I’m not sure what you position is during the week but if you aren’t also getting time for yourself to do something you truely enjoy and makes you happy during the week, you will miss out on this time also on the weekend and potentially end up on the same path. Now the feel goods etc of what you get out of spending time together are great and fantastic, but you also need to self maintain and make sure you’re also doing things that make you happy.

Relationships are a balancing act.

I’m certainly not saying that you’re both going to end up pissed off and full of resentment.

It’s really good that he’s said something.
Communication is important.

I suppose it’s now down to compromising and what either of you are willing to give and take.

What’s the reason for long distance?

Can you get closer together?

I wish you both all the best."
336,"This is an outstanding and professional response. If I wasn’t so cheap, I’d give you gold. Instead, please accept this 💰🥇 as a token of my appreciation for your contribution to our community."
337,"I know you may not feel like your issues is chronic yet, but please come join us in r/chronic pain. I think you’d get great advice there from people like you (and me) who have had their world/life/identity stripped away. "
338,"My step monster did this my whole teenage years. It was awful. Nothing could be said without her making it a snarky comment about my mom. 

It ruined my relationship with her, but it also severely damaged my relationship with my dad. Eight years later now we are recovered, but I will never speak to his wife again. 

It doesn’t matter what your ex did/does to you or what your girlfriend thinks is fair or not, this is your kid’s’ MOM. They deserve to not be in a house that resents one of the most important people in their world. 

Your kids should come first here. Is she ready to coparent if she doesn’t get that? "
339,"Ask your gf how she would feel if one of your friends admitted to a relationship with a 15yo girl.

Guarantee she'd be disgusted. "
340,"&gt;  I owe it to him to give him another chance (after 8 months of dating him, I almost cheated on him, and it was a big deal, but we worked it out) 

Stop there. You don't owe him anything. It doesn't matter what ""almost"" happened in the past.

&gt; Before the baby we would occasionally swing, I'm very open with sex.... if that what he wanted, why not fucking ask me.... I'm losing my mind.... I'm so depressed I cant see straight, I am scared I'm letting my son down and I just want to disappear. 

Please.... you need to get some distance from your husband. Go to your parents, and make sure you find a support group and maybe even some counseling (e.g. a counselor on a sliding scale, a counselor in training, or self-help books).
"
341,"That's a big second step at the first failure. It's easy on the internet to be so flippant, but it isn't actually good advice. There are smaller escalations. "
342,"Nah, fuck that guy. He has the mentality of a teenager. He needed the reality check. You don't need toxic people like that in your life anyway."
343,"I think that part of this is that the kid is a guy. There’s a lot of apathy toward male victims of female sexual predators due to the sexist “teenage boys will screw anything that moves so they should be happy about it” mentality.

I would find out what I could and send an anonymous letter to the kid’s parents or school counselor if I were you. Possibly make an anonymous CPS report."
344,I’m more worried about your husband not believing you over some 19 year old.
345,That's the right thing to do. Block and don't reply. He will get tired and find a new target. 
346,Those are not friends. Those are guys that have been waiting for you to be single so they can get with you.
347,"Your sister sounds like someone who doesn't respect her partner at all. That sounds like a recipe for a shitty marriage that will end in flames. That being said, if your sister wants to be immature and make dumb mistakes, there's really nothing you can do to stop her. "
348,"I honestly think this is all on you.

She asks you what you want to eat for dinner, and that's a problem?  


She sleeps in when she doesn't have to work? And that's a problem, even though you're fine when she's at work?

I get that feeling of ""needing to be entertaining"", I had that hardcore for YEARS. But again, that's on you (As it was for me) to get over. She doesn't actually need you to entertain her.

You feed the ""her"" pet and plant? Uh, duh. You live in the same house now, you can't ignore the things.

She tries to get you to get unhealthy food? Ok, mildly annoying if she won't take no as an answer, but is that really a thing that only happened after you moved in?

The biggest thing is the not having people over. That's unfair and unrealistic. 

In short, this isn't about her.  Almost everything save for the company is an issue you can't see to deal with. You don't need to entertain her all the time, you still can go out with friends and do quiet work when she's in the house.
If you feel you can't do those things, thats either a problem with your perception or a problem with her as a partner....not as a roommate."
349,"You’re not wrong. Your sister has a very childish, toxic view of relationships and it is 100% going to bite her in the ass. 

That said - not much to be gained from her teenaged sister pointing that out. She’s made it clear that her plan is her plan, and she’s not open to feedback. If you want to apologize for something, apologize for offering unasked-for opinions and phrasing them aggressively. Calling someone’s engagement “dumb” (even if it is) is a rude thing to do, and your sister will probably be in for a harsh awakening anyway. It’s not up to you to point that out. "
350,"I would let it go. My sister always tells people, “I can’t have children.” That usually ends the conversation, but if any one asks why, she tells them she’s allergic. Lol!!"
351,"And when she asks why you’re not talking to her, this is *exactly* what you should tell her. That she won’t respect boundaries regarding your husband. I’d add “We can’t be friends if I 1. cannot trust you to behave appropriately around my husband and 2. if you’re not going to respect me enough to do exactly that.” She’s gonna play victim. “Oh noes! What have I ever done to deserve such accusations?! I’ve never done anything to make you think .... yada yada yada.” She can fuck off with that. Cut her off and end her toxic effect on your life. 

Trust me when I say I know *exactly* what I’m talking about. "
352,"&gt; This is very much a power play. He's telling you he's top dog of the house.

No he's not. He's a 14yo boy. He's discovered porn and jacking it and being 14yo is doing it all the time, multiple times.
"
353,Or not. Some moms don't support their daughters for whatever reason. 
354,"If he *is* in there with unlimited access to porn going at it for two hours they would be doing him a favor by setting some ground rules.

 I'm as sex positive as it gets but I'm kinda concerned for this kid needing to masturbate for two hours in the evening frequently enough to have begun disrupting his step dads ability to get to work on time."
355,"He's almost definitely not even sitting in the shower. It's already been pointed out that he's in there well past the time when hot water has run out. 

He's sitting on the toilet wanking it in what is in all likelihood a very unhealthy manner (edging for 1-2 hours as a teen with unlimited access to porn? not great for sexual development). He needs to not be allowed his phone in there, and a timer set for all evening showers."
356,It sounds like you need to talk to her about this.
357,He’s not even willing to go 10 minutes out of his way for you. 
358,This is important. Maybe it was normal with her brother? Don't go into this conversation ready for a fight. 
359,"&gt; This is a classic form of mental abuse

This is so fucking crazy to me. If everyone else is right and it is abusive, then why did it feel so normal? Like, what she told me makes sense, and I can totally see why wanting to keep talking about it is annoying. I don't know..

&gt; you can't hold it over her forever

I get that, but it's not like I'm bringing it up all the time or anything. I just don't know when I'm supposed to be over it "
360,"Adults don’t date kids, they groom them. Even with so called “good intentions”, to continue the relationship now revealed to be illegal and morally wrong is to support child predators and the emotional and physical and sexual harm of a child and that is never ok. OP should call the police first thing with her name and address. Then break up with the pedophile supporting girlfriend because that’s what she is doing and if she doesn’t acknowledge that fact then she is not only lying to you and everyone in her life but herself too. "
361,Do not have children with an anti vaxxer
362,"If your sister was abused, I'm not sure the people you went and checked her story with would actually know the truth...  I'm lucky to have never been in that situation personally, but I gotta say if I was I would have a much easier time confiding in someone like you vs. my grandmother. The cheating thing would be a little easier to verify with other people I suppose, but I still wouldn't assume that your grandmother would know all the details or not have reason to lie to protect her own kid's infidelities. 

To put that aside for a moment and assume she's definitely lying about those specific things that you've verified with other people -  your message sounds harsh and I don't think you should say it like this. I think you should talk about it in the specifics rather the broad. IE no 'you always lie' language. I would start with the cheating thing. Talk about what you heard from your grandmother. Ask her to really think about the evidence she has about her parent cheating. 

W/ the cheating, you don't seem to know if she's 'lying' in the sense that she knows it never happened and is just trying to mess with people VS. she really feels &amp; believes it happened despite hearing evidence to the contrary. There's a big difference there, especially when you're dealing with a 15 year old who may have hazy memories of the past and how things went down when her parents we're divorcing. "
363,"Were his parents abusive? When I left my abusive parents house at 19, I apologized every time I so much as spoke. It takes some time to undo that kind of conditioning. "
364,"My guess is this: he knew what he was doing - you just started working out, your confidence is improving because you are already hyped about the results you'll get, and he's a fucking child. The things people say out loud are *unbelievable*. There's an actual man out there somewhere who will appreciate you, and even if it takes awhile to find him, you won't be with this guy! Gross."
365,"Yeah, he absolutely did. He even TOLD HER he didn’t forget what she was in the middle of. It’s not even speculation, he straight up told her he interrupted on purpose. "
366,"The problem is not that she didnt learn...it's that she doesn't care to learn now.  Getting frustrated and giving up is a pathetic and immature response.  Anyone can watch YouTube or read a recipe.  And she had you there willing to teach her.  

The problem is her attitude towards learning AND the fact that she doesn't seem to care at all that her failures to try to be an adult add so much work to your life.  She knows she is adding stress to you and doesn't care.  She doesn't care about being an equal.

You need to talk to her.  Either she starts maling serious efforts to learn basic life skills so sje can do half the chores, or she starts paying for a cleaning service.  Tell her you need her to start bring an equal partner or you don't know how this will work long term.  "
367,Give *specific* examples. 
368,"She sounds awful, tbh. I don’t know why anyone would marry her. Marriage is about being together and love, not flashy rings. At 21, she seems hung up on the superficial aspects of the wedding day. :/"
369,I’m pretty sure your girlfriend being gay and therefore not interested in you sexually or romantically is a very good reason to end a relationship. 
370,Off topic but I what on earth are your water and power bills like?? Massive financial cost and waste of resources as well as downright inconsiderate. No way in hell would my mother allow me to stay in the shower longer then 20 minutes when i lived at home. Let alone 2 hours.
371,"Fighting like you're on fire is not, and never will be, a good thing. It is horrible. I'm not sure how you can try to spin it like it's some sort of passionate, positive thing in your marriage.

Your wife is clearly done with your fire fights and clearly she doesn't feel safe bringing it up with you because you fight too aggressively.

Talk to her about what you saw and actually do something about it. Get anger management. Get couples counseling. Do what's necessary to repair what has been broken."
372,"I think your boyfriend is being a really stand up guy!  I'm glad that he supports you and doesn't defend his parents when they treat you poorly.  

I think you are doing a great job of being kind to him about his parents while still maintaining boundaries that make you feel comfortable.  If he is still choosing to limit his contact with them, even when you say it's not offensive to you that he go to see them, I would think it's because he's angry at their behavior and not just angry because you're upset.  He agrees with you that their behavior was unacceptable.   He's probably upset too because it's hard to see you parents do mean, rude, or cruel things to other people.   Him being bummed out that his parents suck (in this particular case) isn't your fault at all but it's still a bummer for your boyfriend.  "
373,...those sound like they could be fundamental incompatibilities if she feels so strongly that she's calling you stupid. 
374,"She's not the problem here. You boyfriend is the problem. Why? even if she makes advances on him, if this was a girl who was 100% NOT his type, then you wouldn't be writing up this post in the first place. Because wouldn't be giving her this special treatment. He wouldn't be giving her the time of the day.  Therefore, he's the problem. 

I just read your  other replies. His responses are defensive and he knows exactly what he's doing. And don't ever believe a guy when they say they just being polite and that they're oblivious. I don't know if you browse the sub, but a couple of weeks ago a girl came on reddit to ask about a similar question about her boyfriend's coworker. She claimed that her boyfriend is too ""nice"" to shake the coworker away. 2 weeks later, a guy made a post saying that he has a huge crush on his coworker and doesn't know what to do since he has a girlfriend. Turns out that this guy was the boyfriend the girl was talking about. She revealed later on that he cheated on her. I'm not saying that everyone's the same and that this is what's going to happen. But if your boyfriend is doing deeds for another girl and DEFENDING her, then I think you know who his higher on his priority list.  

And it looks like he's starting gaslight you. And you know what? You seem way more mature than he is. The more you try to cling on, the more he'll look to the other girl, because ""holy shit my crazy gf won't give me space!"" Start investing your time on other things... he's not worth your time. "
375,"Your mother doens't have to support both of you, like you said you have a fiance/MIL to help if needed. Do what you want to do, this is your decision not your mothers. You are not in the wrong."
376,"This behaviour is psychotic.  I think it's a blessing that you are getting away from this person.  

The only thing that you can do is remain super calm, provide a simple, unemotional explanation to your friends - something like:  ""I care about Katie and wish her a happy and fulfilling life.  It hurt deeply when I discovered that she had been lying to me for two years, and it's true that I felt manipulated, especially with all of the plans that we made together. But that said I wish her all the best and hope that she can live openly and honestly from this point forward.""


Wash, rinse, repeat.  People are going to believe what they want to believe, and never underestimate the desire for drama, which Katie is obviously providing in spades.  Rise above it, be the bigger person, and your worthy, intelligent friends will recognize who the stable, truthful one is and come through for you.  As for the ones that don't, and as for Katie herself - fuck 'em.  How dare she treat your life as something for her to play around with at whim.  I don't care what orientation you are or who you identify as, it is disgusting to deliberately ruin someone else's life.  "
377,"I agree with getting a lock, but the whole time I was reading this post, I was like, “Just tell her to stay out of your damn bedroom!” It doesn’t matter if SIL *should* know better. The point is that she *doesn’t* know better, or simply doesn’t care. 

Also, OP missed a golden opportunity to scare the s**t out of SIL by popping out from under the covers when SIL opened the door. Although I think it’s indicative of how scared OP is of confrontation that she literally hid under the covers instead of shouting, “What are you doing in here?!”"
378,"&gt;And he clarified that some men like big boobs but he just isn't one of them and that **my boobs are ridiculous** and he really prefers flat ones

That's seriously just plain MEAN. Your husband is mean to you.

&amp;#x200B;"
379,"&gt;I managed to get access

Uh, what does this mean? Was it an accident or had you been poking at her phone and computer trying to get into her accounts?

This is a weird post, you don't even give context of *why* you were snooping, or what the context was for calling you an idiot. Like another commenter said, you read the texts and you know what the reasons were, so why don't we? 

It almost sounds like you went looking for trouble and a reason to break up  with her. People shouldn't shittalk their SOs to their friends, but you don't sound much like of a prize yourself. "
380,I don't understand the confusion on your end. He literally said you're not the one. What exactly do you hope changes that didnt change in the year you've lived together? 
381,"Get the hell out of dodge man. She's guna gut you like a fish in court if she files first. Get ahead of the shit storm that brewing and get out now. I wouldnt risk my kids, my life, my career, and the things I've worked hard for over a woman who is willing to falsely call me an abuser and use that to cheat on me"
382,"Also a bride can choose to wear whatever style dress in whatever color, makeup in whatever style, hair in whatever style... Why would glasses be any different? A lot of people prefer to go sans-glasses on their wedding day but it's just that... Their choice and their preference.

What a ridiculous thing for someone to choose something for a bride like that. I wouldn't even acknowledge it."
383,"Well, talk about it. But cheapskates get worse after you marry them.

He probably thinks you are dating him for his money."
384,Only six months and he wants to assign you responsibilities for his childish behavior? That would be too much for me.
385,No this isn’t right. Both partners should know exactly what is going on financially in a household. Where would you start if something happened to him and say he was hospitalized and unable to work or communicate or manage the finances? Keeping you in the dark is just irresponsible on many levels.
386,And character statements because damn it takes a cold person to push your cousin down a ravine and leave them there to die while you go to work. I think that would be out of character for almost anyone.
387,"Remind her one more time that parenting is not a contest to see who is better and that you don't want to hear her badmouthing your children's mother again.

If she won't change her behavior, find a new girlfriend who will respect your boundaries and wishes."
388,"If you were trying to kill her, why would you haul her out of the ravine and get help? Why would pushing her down a ledge be remotely successful in killing her?  It makes no sense, not to mention your time cards with work prove you were gone too long to responsible as her diabetic response shows she was down there for a long time. 

Lastly, if police get involved, get a lawyer right away. Ex officers and lawyers alike all preach the same thing. This can go ten directions sideways in a hurry even if it seems like the police are ""on your side."""
389,"She's going to turn her nose up at it, act like she knows better than decades of progress in child development, and act like this is a grievous personal attack."
390,"It’s none of your business but she wants to move in with you? That doesn’t make sense and sounds like a potentially very unpleasant living scenario. She would be your roommate and won’t even talk to you about it? 

Is she going to live with you guys for the rest of your lives??? 

It sounds like he puts your needs after his and hers. "
391,You told him how it makes you feel. He told if you don't like it to leave. Take him up on that and break up. Remove his access to all of your accounts on social media and whatever app on your phone. Block him everywhere and get a restraining order if necessary. 
392,My dad used to shut off the hot water if we were in there for more than 10 minutes to get us out faster. Maybe try something like that if it happens again?
393,"This is going to be tough, but you need to keep emotion out of it. Saying you’re disgusted isn’t helpful or giving direction as to what you want out of their help. Saying “I had a situation with my boss that needs help navigating, I’d like to see you first thing Monday morning to discuss” keeps things more level headed and about the situation, not about your emotions from it.

When you talk, they’re probably going to ask what your ideal outcome here is (ie, what do you want to happen). Take the weekend to think about it, and be realistic in what you want to happen if it comes up."
394,"&gt; I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary

She obviously doesn't know about this unspoken boundary. It's to speak!"
395,"Sounds like he's getting cold feet. It might have bothered him low key for a while and now he doesn't want to lock in something (moving in together ) when there's a ""flaw"" that he sees. 

Also people forget that your SO doesn't have to be your everything. My partner and I share many hobbies but if I like to drink and she doesn't as much, then I would just go out more often with friends. My partner hates baseball but that's my thing so I just go to games with my baseball friends. It takes nothing away from our relationship. 

If you feel like fighting for it, try and have a serious conversation about it, but it seems like he's not mature enough to move in together or looking for an excuse to get out. You deserve better, but maybe he can turn it around after a good conversation"
396,I honestly don’t know how anyone could read this and not think this entire situation is so unhinged. Get divorced and get therapy to help develop a better sense of healthy relationships. 
397,"That part just infuriated me. If you're the father of four and the only thing keeping you from offing yourself is a dog then it's time for inpatient treatment. 

But I'm willing to bet anything that he's just using the threat of suicide to get his own way. He's a 35-year-old man throwing a fucking tantrum over that doggie in the window. It's disgusting. "
398,"You can’t degrade people working in jobs that you directly benefit from and still be a good person. 🤷‍♀️ 
It’s why I don’t entertain people who look down on waiters or trash collectors. Ain’t nobody got time for that BS. 

OP, I also have a bachelor’s and am not working in my field - due to lack of opportunities where I live - while my partner is working in what he majored in during college. 
Your b/f is entitled and spoiled. Either have a come to Jesus talk with him or kick him to the curb so he can see what 16 hours a month is really like financially. "
399,"She’s exactly where she needs to be, in the hospital. Hospitals don’t mess around with high-risk pregnancies, she will be okay. Of course it’s scary. You care for these people and that’s your brother in there. Take deep breaths, drink some hospital coffee."
400,He and his friends made fun of your looks behind your back? Wow what a great boyfriend to stick up for your honor back then. I do find it hard to believe 20 years could go by without this becoming an issue. Has he never complimented your appearance?
401,"You might want to restrict your Facebook and social media from the more general view, for obvious reasons. That's an easy inroad to your life. As for the rest, *stand by family that stood by you*. Maybe you'd be more open to it if these were people you *knew* and had regular, consistent contact with as opposed to people who really are just names from the past with common blood. Don't be a bank for people whose lives you have no part of, and who have no part in your life."
402,"If a mental health or ID/DD worker behaved like this with a client or patient, they would be in such deep shit they'd never see the sun again. This is not healthy, safe, or therapeutic in any way to the client. Professionals are educated and drilled on appropriate boundaries and how to hold them (kindly, firmly, and consistently) with clients. If your fiancee thinks she's helping this man, she is wrong. She is doing nothing to support his independence or mental well-being. I would be shocked if the agencies your fiancee works with think that inviting a client to a bar with friends, let alone letting him touch her and be possessive around her fiance, is okay. You are not wrong to feel skeeved out and upset. "
403,"I’m glad you stepped in OP, and your gf should have no say in this BUT ALSO why is she trying to let your cousin R Kelly’d tho "
404,Honestly this is the same vibe I was getting! It seems like he just doesn't care...
405,"&gt; Why would she be jealous if she’s happy in her relationship? 

Just because she's been with him for six years doesn't mean she's happy. And for all you know she's jealous of your independence."
406,A total stranger would have been 100% justified in interfering with a TWENTY YEAR OLD ADULT MAN coming onto a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CHILD. 
407,"My money is on OP is paying for it. This guy will also never, ever get a job with the attitude he has. If he somehow made it to an interview he'd be rejected within a few sentences. No one wants to work with a narcissistic self important asshat and I'm left scratching my head trying to figure out what on earth OP gets out of this relationship that's making her stay. He sounds absolutely draining."
408,You know what's going on. 
409,"No, not your coworker, HR. 

Seriously, talking to him just means more drama."
410,"Having a stay-at-home spouse when there aren't any kids seems...what's the point of this arrangement, exactly? Why isn't she working?"
411,She is clearly not considering Harold's feelings either. He is clearly in love with her and she is leading her on by not setting boundaries. Also what kind of idea is to invite a guy that is love with her to her wedding? How would that make anyone feel? How about Harold?
412,"I... wouldn’t really bother trying to please him. If he would rather just not have sex instead of communicate with you, I see absolutely no reason to jump through hoops to impress him. In other words, go find someone who can use his words like an adult."
413,Came to here say this. If you don't want to talk about it lock will keep her out!
414,"One step at a time, OP. Just breathe. You'll know more after your appointment tomorrow. Try to stay calm until then.

There's a saying that worrying about something preemptively puts you at risk to go through it *twice.* So as scary as it is, try to take it one step at a time. 

Your boyfriend is a grow up, this is a real grown up relationship and these are real grown up problems. He will be okay, and you will be okay. Just breathe. And good luck tomorrow."
415,"My father was the same thing. Diabetic with high blood pressure and cholesterol. He died very young and it wasn't pretty. 

Make sure he has good life insurance and everything is taken care of. Sorry, you can't help those who don't want to be helped. "
416,Go to HR first thing Monday.
417,"&gt;But it turned out with him saying he’s not ready to get married because he’s not sure I’m the one.

This is all you need to know. He doesn't want to marry you because he's not sure you're the one. So, ok. Decline being his parking spot or waiting room and go out and find the man for whom you are the main event. This dude is not your future husband. So wish him well for finally being honest with you, and cease letting him waste any more of your time. 

&gt;We’re financially stable, no kids, no big life changes. He said he needs to see us going through problems and rough time to see how strong our relationship is, and then maybe change his mind, but the problem (or not! Haha) is that we have always had an amazing, caring, loving, healthy and smooth relationship, we’re mature enough to solve our problems without big dramas, but this one.

hunnie this is bullsh!t
let him go"
418,I wish someone had pasted this simple flowchart behind my eyelids in my youth.
419,"You can say that you trust him now but you'll always resent him. With good reason, but still. Kids aren't dumb. "
420,"Reading this, all I can think of is, “Why would he *want* to change his habits?” He gets to play games while being completely taken care of. I’ll bet that sounds like a really sweet deal to him. Of course he’s not going to want to stop doing what he wants to do to participate in household contributions if he already has someone doing them for him. People will treat you the way you allow them to.

But! I hope you’re both better for it now. Or, at least, I hope YOU are better now."
421,"This seems like a concerning situation.


What reason did your parents give for pulling you out of school?


Have they actively been preventing you from getting out of the house? If so, do they say why?


What reason do your parents have for your brother living a seemingly normal life?"
422,"And then why would that person go back and pull her out?? Family is probably too stunned to think straight about the situation but still, jeeze. I feel awful that OP is going through this."
423,"The only issue is this is just a band-aid. The actual problem is OP's SIL is a nosy person and should be put in her place, since I doubt she will stop being nosy. Plus, every adult needs to learn how to have an awkward conversation, otherwise they'll continue to be a non-confrontational doormat."
424,"Run. You’re too young for this. I stayed, and it nearly destroyed me."
425,"You are so young. Don't waste these years with a guy who makes you feel like crap. Is he usually caring and supportive, or is this behaviour just an extension of what he's usually like? I'm guessing this didn't really come out of nowhere.

And FYI, he said your job is cooking and cleaning because that is what he really believes. He believes that is ""women's work"" and that it is beneath him. He is a misogynist. He can hide behind saying it was sarcasm or a joke, but his actions speak very clearly. He expects you to shoulder the bulk of the housekeeping for the next 60+ years.

Truly, you deserve better than this."
426,"Facebook is used just to pass the time. Reddit is used just to pass the time. 

Tinder? No. If he hasn’t met up with anyone yet, it’s only in time and he will. 

Leave him. Get a full check up at dr (just in case he has met up with people already). And file for divorce. 

Unless you just *really* want to stay with him, then maybe counseling. Get him to be honest, and maybe have an open and or poly relationship. "
427,"Your boss is an idiot. Unblock him and let him text his little heart out. Go to HR. If they do nothing, and you have a hostile work environment start posting in 
R/legaladvice because you have harassment in writing and that is pretty irrefutable."
428,"Would definitely not be absurd to tell them how you feel. For whatever reason they haven't invited you, they need to know that this has hurt you. 

Is there a chance that they thought you wouldn't want to come, or wouldn't be interested as you'd lost touch with them a bit? 

Not excusing it, just trying to figure out their motives as that might reduce the hurt your feeling. Either way, you wont know the full story and get closure on this until you've asked them why you weren't invited and how you feel about it. 
"
429,"He relies on your self doubt. 

The cops will know how to handle it and draw it out from you. At the very worst case, you will be establishing a record and they will tell you what more they would need. 

But this guy is well on his way to breaking bones, knocking out teeth, or killing you.

You need to go the the authorities asap. "
430,"Your wife is being unreasonable, I don't think you were in the wrong at all. I'm the kind of person who likes taking long showers (not 1 or 2 hours though, that's just beyond ridiculous), and I intentionally shower at a time when I know it won't be a bother to anyone else in the household. If someone else does happen to need the shower at that time, I will immediately hurry up my shower and finish it as fast as I can. I don't understand why your stepson can't just wait until you leave to shower, or shower beforehand, especially if he \*knows\* your schedule. He's being very inconsiderate and your wife really should have helped put a stop to this a long time ago instead of coddling him. "
431,"Sure it could be worse. Always could. Doesn't mean it's not already bad.

Listen, she *cheated* and is somehow making you the bad guy for not letting that go. That's appalling. And I can guarantee, I'd bet my  bollocks on it, she's gonna cheat again.  Indeed, you have no idea how often she's cheated and got away with it.

I mean, how did you find out this time? Not by her telling you. "
432,"Grandma needs a refresher in child development, methinks. Arm yourself with information from your doctor and from professionals and from textbooks, because I get the feeling she's gonna respond better to that than to you. "
433,"The doctor won't be able to share information with your parents.  You're over 18, sharing that information with your parents could put the doctor in serious risk as there are laws in place to protect you.  I'm assuming you're in the USA.  


I'd go over options with your doctor; an IUD could be a good option too.  "
434,"There is no decision for you to make. There is nothing for you to be unsure about. Even before the sisterhood thing, she was clear she was not going to date you, so the sisterhood thing is not actually a status change. "
435,"Somehow a heart eye emoji is what crossed the line for me. 

I’d bring it up in a calm manner. Even if she “didn’t mean anything by it”, you can point out that neither of y’all really know what the ex is thinking based on her actions, and what his true intentions are. 

If she’s understanding of this and stops, then yes she’s trust worthy. If she’s defensive and angry, then maybe it’s time to move on? "
436,"&gt; You don’t need him to understand why you’re leaving him

This. You ""convey the information"" in the form of divorce papers."
437,"I think you should listen to all the therapists you've been to see, it's not a coincidence or conspiracy that they're all saying the same thing. Honestly I think therapist #3 said something to her about divorcing you because she's on YOUR side and doesnt think your wife can change. It sounds like it really is time to move on, no one deserves to live in an emotionally unsafe and miserable relationship and that's not the kind of marriage you want your kid to see. "
438,"I refuse to befriend someone who sleeps with people who are taken. It shows a lack of judgment and character. And if you think she won't do it to you, you are fooling yourself. Take her out of your close social circle. No more coming to your house at all. If you see her at a family party say hi and chit chat but keep it light. Don't create an enemy, create distance. "
439,I was about to say... you spend most of your money on the home. That’s contributing as hell.
440,"HR HR HR the second you get in on Monday. Don't even stop to talk to anyone, go STRAIGHT to them and show them the texts.

I'm also a female engineer and I've dealt with the odd bit of creepy behaviour, but nothing to this extent. I'm so sorry :("
441,I hope they make a shared update.
442,"Your partner didn’t “take all the right steps”.

The right step would’ve been telling you immediately when it happened the first time, instead of continuing it for *a year and a half*.

The right step would’ve been owning up to it as a conscious choice on his part, instead of painting himself as some sort of *victim* with his “stuck in s hole part”.

The right step would’ve been telling you himself, instead of you needing to find out by walking in on him.

Cheating can sometimes be worked through...but not in this case. Don’t continue making a mistake by staying. The trust is permanently broken and the relationship is over; accept it, mourn it, then figure out how to move on."
443,"I suspect this is a bit like religious converts.

When they had Alan they decided to bring him up a certain way and ""bought in"" to that way as the one true way.

Now you show up having followed a different way and doing well for yourself. The cognitive dissonance is off the charts. The only way to cope is to undeemine and attack you, prove to themselves they were right and you were wrong. 

What they're doing is similar to what cultists and the super religious do when their belief system is challenged. You might find good advice in the literature for dealing with it."
444,Maybe you can't completely cut her out but she definitely doesn't need to come over for movie nights. Just see her at family functions... those can't be that often can they? Stop hanging out with her outside of the required visits. It also sounds like you have nothing to really worry about since your husband seems just as annoyed with her as you are.
445,"So your father created a scene at your wedding because your husband's family came to the wedding 10 minutes early and was ready to call the wedding off because of it? That sounds unreasonable af IMO. Is this the only reason your husband doesn't like your dad? Or are there other instances of him behaving unreasonably?

You can't force your husband to have a relationship with your dad if he doesn't want one. If you want a future with your husband, it'll have to come at the expense of being close with your family. Once again, is this the ONLY issue between your husband and your dad? Or was your dad's behavior at the wedding just the straw that broke the camel's back?"
446,"Which of you is on the lease? You may want to visit r/legaladvice to figure out the best course of action there.

That sad, I’m so happy that you’re taking a stand for yourself and getting out of this toxic relationship. Your husband has proven over and over again how little respect he has for you and your boundaries - he’s shown beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is not the right partner for you."
447,"Some people are just weirdos. Unfortunately for you, your brother is one of them. He’ll grow out of it. "
448,"First, get a sperm test.  That will give you some important information for the next discussion you’ll have with her."
449,"&gt;She always threatened to sell the house and she will just go live in an apartment

Sounds like an excellent idea.   Many parents downsize their home after their kids grow up and move out.

&gt;she found a retired man with a good pension that moved in with her. He is financially supporting her now.

Good for them.

&gt;How do I get cope with my guilt?

Counseling?   I think you may need to get some Asian specific advice since I believe in that culture it's more expected for kids to financially provide for parents vs a Western culture like Canada / US."
450,It's possible that he feels that he was taken advantage of in those relationships and is overcompensating for it now. Anyway if you really like this guy despite his cheapness then you are going to have to ask him about it. You shouldnt feel bad about this being a deal breaker though. You're only 4 months in. If it's not worth it to you to find out what his deal is then just dump and move on. 
451,"📡 Bullshit censor going off! 

""I was just bored"" and ""I was just looking for friends"" seem to be the favorite refrains of guys using Tinder to cheat and/or window shop. He's hoping you'll buy it and get off of his back so he can go back to it. End the relationship. "
452,"this was basically my ex wife. its just a giant circle / beat around the bush to say: “ i have fallen out of love with you”. i’m sorry you are going through this OP, i understand. but at this point the marriage is done. you have to be both emotionally invested. shake hands and split up. earlier you get it done, earlier you can begin the healing process and move on "
453,"Don’t expect one though. My parent accused me of doing some dumb shit and when I proved I hadn’t, the pulled “but you wanted to in your heart” out of their self righteous asses. Some people are just horrible. "
454,"I dated a psycho who would turn the water on in the shower and stand next to it surfing on his phone. For like half an hour. I needed a shower and seeing him dump all the hot water pissed me off so I’d reach past him standing there naked with his phone and cut the water off. It’s wasteful. It’s inconsiderate to the rest of the family. I’m just saying, he might just be standing there and not actually getting in. I can’t imagine someone wanking it for 2 hours in cold water. That sounds miserable. "
455,How do you know he's been nothing but faithful and amazing since you've gone official? Couldn't he have easily been lying about that as well?
456,"It seems to be hard for him to comprehend how someone could feel so anxious about some financial trouble that's only been going on for 3-4 months after what he has seen in his life. From his perspective you have food, water, shelter, and the likelihood that given time the financial strain will lighten. But think about why his positive outlook is frustrating to you. Do you think that if he had a more anxious outlook similar to yours that it would spur him to some beneficial action? Does it upset you that he can feel so at ease with these difficulties when you can not? Maybe you just want him to say that your unease over these circumstances is valid, and maybe he can't honestly say that to you because to him who has survived so much horror it is not. He may be just as frustrated with you for cracking under pressure as you are with him for being so smugly resilient. At the core he seems to be feeling that things could be worse why complain and you are feeling that things won't get better so why not despair. But all you can do, worry or not, is keep carrying on. You probably can't change his feelings on things anymore than his stories are going to change your anxiety, but maybe if you could focus more on what's going right instead of everything going wrong you could feel a little better too"
457,"Yeah it sounds like he got out there, and wants to be a 25yr old party boy in a new city with old friends and new women, and doesn't want OP tieing him down. "
458,We don't know OPs opinion on those. Could be incredibly stupid. 
459,"&gt;My husband and I have only been married for 6 months but have been together for 5 years and living together for most of that time. 

Is this new behavior or has he always been like this?"
460,"I am sorry, this is really sad - your own parents... 
If your cousin was hyperglycemic/in ketoacidosis from her diabetes, she could certainly have been confused/delirious and hopefully when she clears, she will be able to remember and tell the truth. Either way, I would avoid elanor forever - time for her and her brood to be out of your life. "
461,"You have chosen the most charitable interpretation of his actions and character. I sincerely hope this does not come back to bite your, or more importantly your daughter, in the ass. Best of luck."
462,"""Hey man, I know you hate dishonesty. So the truth is, I don't want to talk about my financial situation. It makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry I didn't just say that right away. We'll talk about everything eventually. But for now, I'd like to drop the subject. Can you accept that?"""
463,"She wants to sit all three of us down and have a talk. Actually, the reason we had our talk on Tuesday was because Lola called my mom and asked why I wasn’t answering her calls or texts... so my mom told her everything and then we talked.

It felt good after the talk but then yesterday happened. I spoke with my mom again today and that’s when she purposed sitting us all down. Right now, I feel so disrespected because of that conversation last night that I don’t want to talk to Lola at all. My mom doesn’t think she’s crushing on Steve but perhaps doesn’t understand boundaries. She’s very impulsive and does things without thinking.

My mom would always chose me over Lola but Lola has been through some shit and doesn’t have family so I think that’s why my mom will always be there for her. Lola does a lot for my mom and took care of the house the three years she lived there.

I think space is best. Lola has a ton of issues and I don’t think I can handle them any longer. I have too much on my plate right now and need to focus on my rehabilitation and my family. I’ll be cordial but I think I need to take a step aside.

A few Redditors mentioned that the issue isn’t “Steve is trustworthy and will shut her down” but rather “will Steve be put in a situation where he’s inappropriately touched.” That really captured my attention and moved my focus to... I guess, not protecting my husband as he’s like the Mountain from GoT... but yeah, I don’t want him uncomfortable in his own home. 

I know what I have to do thanks to everyone!"
464,"He can’t just decide to have catholic values now, if he’s married and sleeping with an 18 year old that’s not very catholic, so his views on abortion don’t come from a ‘catholic’ belief. They come from a ‘oh shit don’t tell my wife I’m sleeping with a teenager and got her pregnant’ place.

I wouldn’t tell him because it’s your choice and if that’s the decision you’ve made his opinion shouldn’t affect it. But also in future probably don’t have sex with someone if you’re not comfortable enough to talk to him about it if things like this do happen. "
465,"To satisfy my own curiosity: does she ever state a reason as to why she thinks this? Not to defend it--because it's a fucking cold thing to say--but I've heard some of my friends say this about their partners when the partner fails to perform in a domestic capacity. Meaning, her husband called her every ten minutes to ask how to do basic chores. 

Is there any context for her comment?

That said. 

I'm a tech. Computer advanced hardware repair and level one data recovery specialist. My husband asks me every time his computer twitches. I have never, ever, EVER called him an idiot or said he only had two brain cells over it. Not even to friends in private. Because that's fucking disrespectful to my partner, and that's fucking unacceptable. You don't shit talk your partner. That's bullshit.

You want to salvage this? Come clean an and demand an apology and an explanation. But I wouldn't hang around with someone who told me they loved me, and then turned around and called me stupid behind my back. You have the right to demand respect at all times."
466,"In case you weren't aware, good decent people who you should be in a relationship with never have horrifying behavior. "
467,"Wow, I'm so sorry. I doubt you are ever going to get a straight answer out of her about why she did this. If I were you, I'd just block her on everything and move on. Any conversation you have is only going to cause you more pain."
468,"Wow, what an unexpected and happy update. It goes to show that hard work, communication, love, and a change of mindset (plus whatever else you all have going on) can lead to a positive change! Thanks for sharing :)"
469,I don't think 4 months is too early for $5 socks ...
470,"Wow, everyone lashing in on the guy should probably consider that he was just trying to let her down easy. He doesn't need to give a reason to not like OP romantically, he just doesn't like her in that way. That's it. He just came up with some excuse because OP pressed for a reason and he probably didn't have any real reason besides just not liking her. 

He has every right to not like her and it's very unfair to judge him and call him insecure over it. From what I read in the OP, he has been nothing but straightforward and fair to her. I would rather advice OP to work on accepting a simple 'no' instead of needing reasons. If it was her who didn't reciprocate someone else's feelings, she wouldn't need to list a reason for it either."
471,"^This. Don't talk to no cop without a lawyer! They are not your friends, not when they've been called against you."
472,"I was just a thinking that this is a very familiar complaint you hear from women.   Humans are wired to not want to bang those who they have to parent, physically and/or emotionally. "
473,"I actually went through something similar! I had a long-term GF who breached six digits of debt and realized she'd basically never land a job with high enough pay to get rid of it on her own. I took a couple extra years to go through college so that I could graduate debt-free, so the idea of 100k hanging over our heads was... yeah, it was terrifying. I tried to explain to her that we were going to need to live extremely frugally for a couple years once we moved in together and basically put every spare penny to her debts, but she didn't really *get* it. She kept talking about all this stuff we should do once we moved in, and if I pointed out it would be a while longer because we'd be paying her debts first she'd get mad at me for killing her daydreaming.

My resolution to myself was that I wouldn't marry her until she proved that her debt was under control on her own. It didn't need to be *gone*, but I needed proof that she could handle it without me. I didn't want to be saddled with her debt - yeah, marriage generally means shared finances, but the difference between us was so extreme I needed some sort of reassurance that it wouldn't all fall on me.

Ultimately, she never made any major progress on her loan, told me that her new dream was to become a housewife and to have me take care of everything financially including her loans, and never looked into any sort of forgiveness programs. It wasn't what broke us up, but it was what kept us from being engaged long enough for other things to break us up.

.

Obviously, your girl is a world ahead of where mine was, but a lot of the basic principle is the same. I would sit her down and have a long, hard talk about her debt. It's fine for her to want to dream and everyone should definitely pursue things they enjoy, but you're absolutely correct in that her debt will slow down any future plans you want to make. How will you handle children? A house? Actually getting married? Life steps are super expensive. 

She should probably also meet with a financial advisor to go over her options on getting rid of the loan. It's definitely possible that she can't, but that's the first thing to explore because it'll save you both so much effort. If forgiveness isn't an option, you two need to fast track getting rid of that debt *however you can*. She needs to make as much money as she can, get a second job, start a side hustle, sell stuff on eBay, whatever. Discuss together what *you're* comfortable contributing. You aren't married or even engaged so you paying her debt directly is probably too much, but are you willing to let her live rent-free for six months so she can funnel everything into the loan?

It's absolutely valid for you to be afraid of her debt, but I don't think it's worthy of running away from right now. Instead, coaxing her into seeing just how threatening her loan is to your future life will hopefully kick start a desire to get it paid down as quickly as possible. Best of luck."
474,Over apologizing and high startle response? He was abused as a kid.
475,"Yeah that's not an appropriate response, appease the crazy one so it's easier... Nah I'd just go no contact."
476,"I grew up in DFW. There’s a ton of small bars in areas of Dallas and FT. Worth. I spent most of my high school years there NOT drinking and going to small indie shows. As an adult I’ve gone to the museums and food places in the cities more often than I ever went to drink. Can you find people who’s main outing is to drink? Sure. But it’s not a barrier or a cultural thing more than any other city. Your guy just wants to continue partying with old friends like he used to and not have to worry about you so he’s giving you BS about Dallas to have you not come. Move if you can afford it and make new friends have fun! If you don’t want to,, then stay. But do whichever for you and dump the boyfriend. "
477,"Your anger is going to break your heart. Staying with him for your child isn't worth it. Especially since he's likely to do this again. It's great you can leave. You should do so. You can try marriage and individual counseling first, but it is okay to decide what he's done is unforgivable. "
478,"&gt;- if she saw me in the street tomorrow there would be no reason to even look at me

At the same time she told me how she could imagine us being great friends


...

do you have a lawyer yet?"
479,"Don't really think you have a choice OP.  Your fiance just dumped you.  He's been very clear that he's not interested in a future with you.  He's called off the engagement and broken the relationship.

For your own mental health and your self respect, you should be cancelling the wedding and telling people and moving on with your life.
"
480,Absolutely not. Do not say yes or you will have a dozen relatives hitting you up for money. 
481,"She said elsewhere he is but apparently that's ok because he's not a liberal 🙄 she also is fine with him bringing the flu and other nasties home since he's an adult, nevermind that a baby can be exposed and get sick very quickly. They both need better education tbh."
482,"To be fair to the girlfriend, it is very hard for a young woman to just outright tell a significantly older man, especially one on a position of power over her, to stop harassing her. 

OP says she ignores and doesn't respond to his sleazy comments and talks to him, which might be all she feels she can do to keep the peace and avoid having him escalate. It's really easy to say ""well she just loves attention, if she didn't she would tell him to stop,"" but that isn't reality for a lot of girls. Especially when the one doing the ""complimenting"" is someone who has the power to take away our jobs if make him mad. A gross guy like her manager is definitely not the type to take a rejection gracefully."
483,These are all MLMs. Have you come to her with information about how MLMs are scams? Maybe trying a different angle will help her see that using that money on a gym membership would be more effective than throwing money at a series of pyramids.
484,Trickle truthing... likely his phone has any and all suspicious dealings deleted right after they occur so it is why he offered it.
485,"Just be careful--people aren't projects. It's good to help others improve themselves, but being a fixer isn't necessarily going to get you into the best of relationships."
486,"Self-esteem issues.  It's not you or a reflection on you.

It's not that he disregards you or necessarily that he doesn't value your opinions.

It's just that he doesn't see himself as you do &amp; can't believe the compliments.

You'll get the most severe response to things he feels most insecure or unhappy about.

What are all the compliments he rejects?"
487,"You didn't ask for this advice, so if it's not welcome, I understand. But, if you want to continue to compliment him, you could try framing the compliments in a way that he will have a harder time negating. If you say, ""I love your generosity,"" he's less likely to say ""No you don't!"" because it is centered around your perception of him instead of directly on one of his qualities. Also, be specific, use compliments that touch on his qualities in a direct way. ""You make great chicken fettucine alfredo"" is less likely to be rejected compared to ""You're amazing"" because 1) it is a demonstrably true fact, and 2) it does not try to sum up his whole person. He doesn't have to feel like he's an amazing person to be able to acknowledge that he makes good chicken fettucine alfredo, and that's a start. "
488,"He's showing off.  He's trying to prove to his parents that it's his house, he runs the show, he's a big boy now. How is his relationship with them?

It's coming from a place of deep insecurity and immaturity.  Dealing with it now isn't going to work because he's going to be defensive.  However, as soon as the in-laws hit the road, you guys needs a come-to-Jesus talk and likely some counselling around this kind of behavior. 

Between this and the ""just joking"" sarcasm, it's apparent that your husband doesn't see you as an equal in think marriage, which can lead to contempt and a dead relationship."
489,"&gt; My (32F) SO (28M) is split between a JustYES and JustNo. His good side  is wonderful and he can be so thoughtful and supportive.  The issue  occurs whenever he is challenged, criticised in any way or asked to do  anything to help (ie housework). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in other words, he's a JustYes when things are going his way and a JustNo when they aren't? "
490,"Boyfriend may be smart, but he's got the emotional maturity of a turd. Dude's almost 30, he won't suddenly have an epiphany that adults sometimes have to make decisions in order to meet their basic needs that are not ideal. Maybe he should stand by the offramp with a cardboard sign that says, ""Too smart to work."" Honestly, if he is that much better than you, if you are so far beneath him, why is he even with you at all? You have your whole life ahead of you, st 24. You are making the best choices for yourself and taking care of business as a functioning adult. Dump this guy. He's a loser. "
491,"R-U-N.

It cannot be overstated. Get. Out. Now."
492,Yep. Super weird. Not okay.
493,Reminds me of all the stories about middle-aged women wearing adult diapers so that they don't have to leave the slot machines.
494,I know that and thank you. I know that talking to the cops is the worst thing you can do so I won't be doing that.
495,"We’re on our way!

You could have come to us!

Which is it? If they’re on their way to you, how exactly would you come to them? Would you have to look out the window to try to spot them driving the other way and then have a party in a lay-by?"
496,"He’s not your boyfriend anymore, he just hasn’t told you yet. "
497,"We are known by the company we keep.  By sticking with her you are tacitly telling her and other people that you approve of her actions, because you are choosing to allow them to be a part of your life.

Choose differently."
498,"If he can't stand up to his wife and enables her, there's really nothing you can do. You and your husband need to set healthy boundaries for yourself."
499,"Yeah lmao.

&gt; It would be easy for me to start over.

OP, start over."
500,"Oh god I know there is definitely humour in the situation, don’t worry.

I usually try and change the subject when my nationality comes up."
501,"Yeah that was the main issue with it all, that I said I was okay when I wasn't. ty for the advice though, i appreciate it."
502,"He's not going to stop. You're enabling his behaviour by staying. He doesn't believe you're ever going to leave him over this, so he has no incentive to stop. "
503,"""It hurts my feelings that you were willing to go out of your way for someone you barely know and not for me. It hurts my feelings that she's constantly trying to get your attention when we're talking on the phone. Why don't you say anything to her?""

Ultimately this is a boyfriend problem, not a roommate problem."
504,"OP, I thought your reaction was really cute and you should keep seeing this girl, in secret from your parents if you have to. I can understand why they said that and it's terrible, but you really shouldn't let that affect your long term happiness. If you are afraid they won't support you while you are in school if you keep seeing this girl, just keep it a tight little secret, but let her know what's happening and assure her you would still like to pursue a relationship but you have to keep it from your parents for the time being and that you really do like her for who she is.

You are almost done with school and once you have a job you will be able to move out and date whomever you please. I wish you all the luck in the world OP."
505,"&gt;I should do a full 60 minute commute as ""I chose this""

That's not how a marriage works.

He sees this as YOU versus HIM. But a healthy relationship is US versus THE PROBLEM.

And the healthy option is the 20/35 option.

TLDR: he's not a team player, "
506,"Just because she says she doesn't like something doesn't mean you can't do it. It sounds like you are trying way to hard to please her about things she probably doesn't even care about. Have some sense of self and do things because you want to do them. Not because you think that's what she wants. If she loves you, doing little things differently won't matter at all. As for the best friend thing, grow a spine and see your friend. Yes it will make her unhappy, but she needs to get over that. "
507,"I still live with my parents..and I don't work so...
All ny money comes from them"
508,"&gt; should i talk to him about this? 

You could. Or you could just recognize someone who is using you and doesn't even care to dress it up with lies and leave. 

Out of curiosity - does he tell stories about how women/ all his previous girlfriends just want money?"
509,"I think it is great that he is standing up for you and you should support him if he feels like he needs to distance himself from them. There are so many posts on here daily where in-laws are insulting people and instead of the significant other coming to their defense, they belittle them and act like their feelings aren’t important. Be grateful that Alan is defending you and support him. "
510,"It’s going to come out, either from your boss or from you. Better it come from you first so you are t on the defense when you talk about it. 

Be honest (but I’d suggest you leave out specifics from your past), this brought up a similar situation from your past, you had an angry, knee-jerk response you aren’t proud of, but this behavior won’t be tolerated and you need support in moving this forward."
511,"No you are not over reacting.

She fucking cheated. You need to cut her out of your life.

---

As for practical matters.

* break the lease if you have to. Talk to the landlord. S/he will just turn around and rent it to someone else. Be willing to cover one months rent as a gesture of good faith and to cover the time it will potentially take to replace you as a renter and the extra time/effort required to find one.
* companies are used to people accepting jobs and not showing up. It happens. Just be honest with them and apologize. (Usually it's because someone got a better offer, but you have good reasons too.)

If you like where you are now, talk to your current employer about staying. Otherwise, polish off the old resume and find a new job where you would like to live."
512,"Well he only saw the other baby for 2 to 3 hours at a time.

I don't like babies but even I can cope with then for that long. 

He sees the other baby as nicer because he didn't have to deal with it all the time. He's not invested in being a father. "
513,"That is ridiculous that he’s allowed to take 2 hour showers when it impedes your ability to get to work on time. He should’ve taken heed of your initial warning and respected you as the head of the house. Put your foot down immediately. And if he continues to do it, shut the water off. "
514,I’m struggling to type this comment because my head exploded reading this. What is the matter with your husband??? Did he fall and hit his head?? I’m reading this and yelling at my phone. Literally saying “don’t say don’t say it” he said it. Then the whole nickname thing. Are you freaking kidding me??? I know he’s your husband but what a POS. Unbelievably cruel and insensitive. You’ll never unring this bell. Whatever you decide good luck. In my opinion dump his ass. 
515,"Maybe OP has a long-time ""friend"" who's not very happy about OP being in a relationship with someone other than him. That or someone has a grudge on her boyfriend, but it wouldn't explain how they got her sister's phone number."
516,"As a woman near your girlfriends age, I’m honestly shocked at her immature and ignorant reaction to you sharing this information with her. What you describe doing probably wouldn’t be considered over the top or make anyone uncomfortable among individuals who grew up in a liberal culture like hers, but I am really shocked that at 28, she can’t take a step back and acknowledge that there is a difference in acceptable and comfortable social affection displays amongst other cultures, particularly one that tends to have more conservative feelings about displaying affection such as Asian cultures. 


Your friend wasn’t giving relationship advice, he was sharing with you, as a long time beloved member of your friend group, that that level of displayed affection made many in the group uncomfortable. This isn’t a judgment or a piece of advice, he was sharing the groups discomfort, which if predominantly Asian, makes sense. Personally I think she was very out of line to message him like she did, as this further displays her complete lack of understanding or adjustment to cultural differences. 


On the off chance you haven’t talked to her one on one about the cultural differences in affection displays and comfort, you need to. If she is aware already, then she just doesn’t care what makes others uncomfortable regardless of differencing cultural norms, and will continue to make these cultural differences about her and as a judgment of her, and it will eventually put a severe strain on your relationships with your friends in that group. "
517,"I don't think you need to worry about whether you're *his* fully committed, supportive partner--I think you need to ask yourself if he's *yours*, because he sounds like he demands your time and energy for no good reason when you have other stuff you need to do, and a guy like that will sap your forward momentum and destroy your ability to get anywhere in your career if you stay with him."
518,Isn’t this a repost? Swear I read this before
519,"Exactly what I was going to say. Only admitting to some part out of guilt because it doesn't make sense it would come up now unless it's a really weird coincidence. Or a crazy ex, but he said he couldn't think of anything.

The Anon person didn't have to say anything about prostitutes or apps, they could've just left it at cheating. This is weird"
520,"If you are going to have surgery, it's going to be for you and not someone else. You can't base an expensive and important decision on someone you barely know. You also shouldn't make important decisions during an emotional state. I personally think it's best if you let this go, and revisit this when you are less affected by the breakup. "
521,"In the dating advice subreddit, I've read before that some people feel their dates/bf/gfs/significant others choosing to treat someone shows that they *care* and are willing to (quite literally) invest in that person. I think your comment, which is spot on, reaffirms this: OP's boyfriend doesn't think she's worthy of fiscal investment. And it's not like she's asking for lavish gifts, either. Sad. "
522,"If she won't respond to your calls, take it to your coworker.

""John, your wife called my personal phone and accused me of having an affair with you.  I was so startled I didn't quite know how to respond.  I wanted to assure her that she's absolutely wrong, but. she's not answering my calls. You'll tell her those suspicions were completely unfounded, won't you?""

Keep your distance from this guy.  He could be innocent and have a jealous wife, or he could be having an affair with someone else."
523,"You need to leave him. 
"
524,"""Why?""

Some people are just miserable and want to spread it.  There was a woman in our friend group who did shit like this for a decade before we figured it out.  Despite breaking two relationships and a marriage several of her friends stuck by her.  WTF?!

""That's all sorted,""

Glad your marriage survived!

""He can't remember who told him""

Not to sow dissent but that seems unlikely to me, which surely must have occurred to you.  Twice I have been told of cheating SOs and both events are seared into my memory.  Given you two are happy now letting this slide is reasonable."
525,I think you need a new boyfriend. 
526,"&gt;Now I don't know what to do. I know losing a coffee shop doesn't seem  like much but it is really the only place in the city  we have, that we  enjoy. We are stuck in the town, we are in for another 6 months. 

You're right, it's not much; it's just a minor inconvenience to switch coffee shops. It's not like you'll be here for years."
527,"I don't think it's a power play. He's just a teenage boy that enjoys jerking off while water runs through his balls. We've all done it. But yeah, fuck that. "
528,Any chance she has a pill addiction?
529,"&gt;She has demanded that I apologize to my cousin and promise her this will not happen again

&gt;Relationship length is 8 months

Projection much? The only controlling person I see in this scenario is the girlfriend. She better have some damn good amazing other qualities because right now she's coming across as a demanding creep and totally out of line for a baby relationship of 8 months."
530,Man? That’s being very kind of you
531,"Um.

Do you have anxiety? Because reading this gave *me* anxiety. You sound frantic, and like you're transferring hypochondria to her. A huge portion of the population has the form of herpes that causes the finger herpes and it's really not something to freak out over. And the HIV stuff... no. Just no.

You are all up in this situation. Just chill out, man."
532,"Not only that but and I hate to be petty, but maybe then they'll realize who is the kid who is always there helping if you back off some. But I think asking them why they didn't even ask if you wanted to go with... I mean, maybe you wanted to celebrate with your twin? I can't believe they wouldn't even ask if you wanted to go or anything. Im sorry you're dealing with this I don't think it's necessarily they like him more but sometimes ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" in a way it's easy to paint him in a good light cause they don't really see him. "
533,"&gt;I can't imagine keeping someone waiting for hours and then being indignant that my personal issues weren't taken into consideration. 

They are ""indignant"" because if they turn *you* into the asshole in the situation, they conveniently don't have to answer for their shitty thoughtless behavior. 

I have an ex-friend who did this all the time. Key word, EX friend. "
534,"You date her.

Yes, dating someone with a handicap will be different. It can be challenging in ways other relationships wouldn't be. Ask your parents what they would want you to do if you dated and married someone *and then* they became a paraplegic. Get a divorce? They sound pretty traditional, so I'm guessing that would be a no.

Ask them for specifics. What, exactly, do they think the problems will be. Her ability to have kids might be a big one, but maybe that's less important to you. Maybe your parents don't know that being a paraplegic doesn't necessarily mean someone can't have kids. Maybe they worry that you'll be judged by society, but again maybe that doesn't matter to you or you feel comfortable overcoming it. If you get their specifics you can try to address their concerns. If they stay kind of vague you can't even have a conversation.

Do this *calmly.* You are an adult, considering adult issues, with other adults, and adults talk about things calmly. They break down problems and consider consequences of decisions and decide things calmly. Confidently! Don't back down if you want something. But don't freak out or respond if they freak out. Your parents may not be used to thinking of you as an adult, so think about how to have this conversation in a way that reinforces that you are making a mature and knowledgeable decision with full consideration of the consequences. You are not a child acting on an impulse. Think about your parents and how they want to see you as an adult and try to be that adult they want to see. It can have a profound impact on the mood of the conversation and how they interpret your decision.

You sound... cultural. Traditional maybe? Basically just not white/american. I'd suggest trying to tailor the conversation to your culture. Fight for what you want, but in a way that appeals to your parents to get their acceptance. Appeals to how they want to see you in that culture and addresses the consequences they're worried about in that culture. It sounds important to you to get their acceptance, so you probably can't simply dismiss them straight up. You need to figure out a way to be confidently who they want you to be, but that also requires them to give you the independence to make the decision for yourself."
535,"She’s probably embarrassed as hell, which is why she’s defensive. Even if she hadn’t said anyone else’s name, that would be so embarrassing to have someone witness. Now add on that she said someone else’s name so she may be concerned you’re mad... yeah her reaction was normal.

If she’s saying the same dudes name, maybe she has a crush but nothing harmful about that. If she is saying multiple peoples name then it’s just random. You really can’t control who you dream about. I’ve had sex dreams about people that repulse me in real life. 

I wouldn’t worry about this and I’d stop bringing it up. If you’re worried she’s cheating, then there would be some sign in her waking hours. This isn’t evidence of anything, it’s just an embarrassing thing that I’d try to let go of. "
536,"There are plenty of things one's partner can do that would be upsetting besides cheating.  


Some people believe that paying for sex is wrong, or at least that doing so in the current climate where at least some sex workers have been forced into the trade via sex trafficking, and it might be difficult to tell which have and which haven't. I'm not saying I agree with that position, but it is a widely-held position and OP may not even know where she stands on it, because she may not have had to think about it before.  


Imagine that your significant other told you that they used to do something else that you had moral qualms about. For instance, they used to shoplift regularly. Or they used to steal from their (old) employer. Or they used to be a member of a racist organization. I think taking 48 hours to decide how you feel about that would be pretty reasonable. Same deal here."
537,I think you need to get into therapy for yourself.  Your husband is abusive and you need to face that and figure out what you want to do.
538,"I noticed I do this whenever I go to my mom's house, ahah. I just sort wonder all over the house and look for any differences (she's enjoying life without children and making changes to the house to reflect that) and see what makeup my mom is using lately/etc. However, if she was annoyed or asked me to stop, I 100% would! "
539,"&gt;Mark's child was just diagnosed with a terminal illness. Now Ryan and I are both too good of people to add on this extra stresser to his wife's life. Apparently, his whole family is completely blindsided by the son's illness and have been extremely invested in his plan of care

How do you know this is true?  Has the child's illness been verified by someone other than Mark?  You already know Mark is a liar-liar-pants-on-fire.  If he'll lie about currently having an affair with you, why wouldn't he lie about a sick child?  

"
540,Neither. Just treat him like an acquaintance. Say hi if he says hi first. Don't initiate contact and don't ask to hang out. 
541,"Fat person here. She knows she's fat. You've talked to her about her weight and given many reasons why she should lose weight, and she probably agrees with you that she needs to lose weight.

Losing weight is hard for a lot of people because it's got so  many emotional AND physical things that make it a problem. She still needs to eat to fuel her body, and figuring out the how and why to not eat more than your body needs sounds simple but putting it into action is pretty hard for a lot of people.

Going to the gym with your fit boyfriend who has lovingly explained he's worried about your health - that's probably just above poking her eye out with a rusty spoon on the lists of things she would like to do. 

I'm not fat-excusing, I'm just saying that...she knows she should lose weight. And she hasn't for a million reasons. Marrying you won't change her into someone who is suddenly able to do what it takes to lose weight.

You aren't going to be able to talk her into it, because she doesn't need convincing, she at this time does not feel like she can do it and she's probably tried a 1000 times to lose weight and has failed. She may find a way at some  point, but you aren't going to be the one who helps her.

Decide if you can live with a fat wife who may be everything in your dreams other than her body size. If you can't, there is zero shame in that. Physical appearance is really important and you won't be a monster for realizing that you will always want her to change. 

If you can't just let it go and understand that she knows very well she's fat, knows the health issues, and may very well never lose enough weight to  not be fat, then you need to let her go. You don't have to be cruel. But you don't want to spend your life wishing  the woman you married was different, and she doesn't want to spend her life never being good enough. "
542,"THIS. 

Clearly he needs to be educated. Maybe bring him along to your next ogbyn consultation so he get get schooled on how it is safe and how the pull out method is bs"
543,"Your second paragraph is a slippery and dangerous slope, though, because it’s basically planting the idea that even a lack of evidence is evidence. And that isn’t necessarily the case. "
544,"He’s not even passively looking to cheat. I’d call it active! No one (in a happy relationship) downloads tinder just for non-sex fun, ESPECIALLY without telling their SO. I agree that his reasoning is 100% bullshit. Sending virtual hugs as you decide what to do. "
545,"Hi. Wanted to chime in as I'm in her field. Basically she needs to swallow her pride and get a consulting job (it's how many move to state and federal service anyway so she should do it). She'll make double at least.

Sit down with her and have a serious conversation about your future financial goals. If you want her to be able to contribute equally to expenses let her know how important that is to you. She's likely just assuming you're ok with being the main earner, as many relationships in our field have this dynamic and it doesn't sound like you've had a conversation about her being an equal contributer. 

Tbh she's in this field for good, but that doesn't mean that her career is tied to public service. She can work for a consulting firm and do good and be paid well. "
546,"I’m a bisexual female and how I feel towards women is different from men. I’m sexually attracted to women though I’m not sure I’m romantically attracted to them. On the other hand, I’m romantically attracted to men with a lower sexual attraction.

I’m also working on a psychology degree and one of the things we learn is that professional psychologists consider sexuality, and bisexuality in particular, to be a spectrum. There’s no one “mold” you have to fit to consider yourself bisexual. Try not to focus on labels too much, and focus more on what/who makes you happy"
547,"1. Asks a woman in a relationship to be in a relationship with him instead.

2. After the woman declines, ignores and trys again.

3. After the woman declines again, and explains (even though she doesn't need to justify not dating someone) that they have different life goals, he diminishes them and says that she may change her mind in the future.

4. It takes declining AGAIN for him to get the point that OP doesn't want to date him. 

I don't care if he's in the military, a national hero, or a guy who simultaneously saved a box of kittens from traffic while helping an elderly man cross the street. That's still a douchey way to act. 
"
548,John sounds just as shitty as jane tbh - tried to break up a long distance relationship and just assumed OP's goals
549,This dude is cheating on his wife with a teenager. In my opinion he doesn't really deserve anything but a swift kick to the butt.
550,"&gt; I feel guilty though, for being relieved that he put me first and them second.

This isn't about you at all. This is really about them being poisonous, and your BF coming to terms with it. Please support him without trying to convince him."
551,"Look, simply sit your bf down and tell him that you don't feel comfortable about this open relationship and would like close it. If he's not okay with that, you're simply not compatible and it's time to end it."
552,"&gt; If your sister was abused, I'm not sure the people you went and checked her story with would actually know the truth... I'm lucky to have never been in that situation personally, but I gotta say if I was I would have a much easier time confiding in someone like you vs. my grandmother. The cheating thing would be a little easier to verify with other people I suppose, but I still wouldn't assume that your grandmother would know all the details or not have reason to lie to protect her own kid's infidelities.

I was going to mention this, too - I know the details and elaboration is sparse in the OP, but I had the same assumption. Family members *routinely* will deny physical/sexual abuse committed by other family members for a thousand reasons - denial, fear of social ostracization, fear of being abused themselves, etc.

Even if the half-sibling has the tendency to spin tall tales, I still would tread *veeery* carefully if I was going to accuse them of lying when they told me about sexual abuse they sustained. I was abused by my parents and family members, and if anybody went to *them* to ask about it, you better believe they'd put on a huge production about how ""this is the first *we're* hearing about it!"" or ""How could our own son lie about their parents in such a terrible way? Poor us, boo hoo hoo"" etc."
553,"I’ve learned that it’s near impossible to help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves without being resented, no matter how noble your intentions."
554,"&gt; when you set out to finally trap somebody, you catch me. Lol what a waste 

Abuser tactics again: EITHER find someone with low self-esteem who thinks nobody else would want them therefore is too scared to leave you OR find someone, isolate them, and work on them for five years until they DEVELOP low self-esteem so they think nobody else would want them therefore is too scared to leave you"
555,And the friend was literally sat outside in the cold. It's not like they were just sat at home comfortably (not that that would be an excuse but would at least make the waiting more tolerable)
556,Now he gets to take care of 4 kids and a puppy and 10 chickens on his own. Take your fur baby and go!
557,"You should have grounded him or taken away some kind of privilege (or had your wife do that) every time you were caused to be late for work. You can easily be forgiven for getting angry and swearing, but it's far from an ideal response. 


Ideally you would have addressed this behavior 2 years ago."
558,"\*UPDATE\*

First of all, thank you to everyone for taking the time to reply to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I confronted my girlfriend about this. I know she's not planning anything with this guy because she wants me to meet him and he wants to meet me, and she hasn't seen him in years. It's purely a principle thing for me; more about drawing lines and boundaries than anything else. I pretty much told her that those kinds of comments made me feel uneasy and insecure about myself, and that I would never, ever post anything like that on an ex's instagram. I told her I was pretty bummed out about it.

&amp;#x200B;

At first she messaged me and just said ""I'm sorry I wont post stuff like that again"". A few hours later she called me, she was pretty emotional, and she basically told me she was completely in the wrong here, and she didn't think about how I would feel seeing that kind of stuff. She tends to use a lot of emojis and so does this guy, and I think she truly didn't mean anything by this. She assured me she'll never comment or message people in that kind of way again.

&amp;#x200B;

Again thanks to everybody for your help!

&amp;#x200B;"
559,It sounds like you two are being thoughtful and loving. Wanting each other to be happy. Just be honest and before marriage go to counseling to work through the details. 
560,"Lifetime gamer here. Husband for six years, father for four. 

Gaming is important to me for recreation, enjoyment, and stress relief. I also enjoy the solitude. I cannot function unless I am given some time away from my wife and children, a time when I can temporarily disable “adult responsibility” mode and relax in a virtual world. 

However, I have to strike a cautious balance between my recreation and the relationships that matter to me. I make sure that I spend more nights with my wife than with my computer, and because of this, she’s extremely supportive and respectful of my gaming time. Plus, I genuinely enjoy my time with my wife and kids more than I enjoy gaming. 

This is a very real problem of our generation and your husband’s “at least I’m not out drinking” is a weak attempt to shame for you wanting more time with him. At the end of the day, it sounds like you are not happy, and you can easily trace this problem back to his gaming. 

You have to be plain with him. If he is spending a majority of his free time on his PC and it’s hurting your relationship, you have to tell him. Best of luck, I hope you two can work it out. "
561,"That guy is a piece of shit. If you want to leave, you should. You deserve to be with someone who respects you. 



And if you stay even though you don't want to, what are you telling your daughter? That being unhappy in a relationship is normal and it's okay to settle for less than you deserve? Kids pick up on things. She will realize you stayed for her, and she will think she ruined your life. "
562,"If he's not in the group chat where you makes plans, how does he keep finding out? Is there someone in your group who invites him? "
563,"he straight up said I don't think you're the one. He isn't stringing her along, he's been very open and honest. "
564,"I think it's ridiculous for him to be allowed to take 2 hour showers at all. Honestly, half an hour is pushing it."
565,Have you actually talked to him and told him it bothers you that he seems to be prioritizing her?
566,"&gt; She’s always invited to family events by even my extended family.

Can you tell your mom what is going on, and ask her to stop inviting her to family events? Your family should be on Team You, not Team Lola, and Lola is far out of line here. As a mom, I would not want a woman in my house, no matter how close I was to her previously, who was making a play for my child's spouse."
567,"&gt; my guitar collects dust in the corner

Get rid of the GF and dust off the guitar."
568,"My parents divorced when I was a small child. It sucked at the time, but I am SO grateful that they didn't stay together and keep fighting. Having divorced parents isn't ideal, but honestly, it's not nearly as bad as people seem to think. It's for sure better than having parents that stay together ""for the kids.""

When she's old enough to pick up on/figure out that you stayed with him ""for her sake"" she will feel guilty and responsible for your unhappiness. Is that what you want?"
569,I'm going to go ahead and side with the GF. Why? because you've been asked a bunch of times in this thread for **specific** examples of discussions/opinions that would cause her to call you an idiot. I'm going to have to assume you don't want to tell us because you are in fact being an idiot about whatever it is and you know we will side with her once you tell us.
570,"Yeah, you’re right. I’m just going to pour myself into my studies, friends, and self care. I’ll be okay. Just sad for a while 😕"
571,"Consider this the asshole tax you've paid to be rid of him and learn a very valuable lesson or two. 

Breakups and divorces are often expensive. Because they are so worth it."
572,"Do you both live in the same house? Then you should both do housework. 

Breadwinner really only applies when the other person isn't working at all. You're both bringing in income ergo you're both breadwinners. It's not fair for all your money to go towards the shared house items and he gets to use his for god only knows what. Don't be afraid to stick to your guns on this since you're in the right. If he truly wants to keep money matters separate then go full on separate. Split the bills, groceries, and items in half and have him pay you. Keep open documentation so he knows you're putting the money where it's supposed to go and you know he's paying what he owes. While you're at it, charge him extra for cleaning services. You already have a job and don't need to be anyone's underappreciated and free maid."
573,"Have you literally told him, in those exact words, that his phone use is ruining your relationship? 
Sometimes, a dose of harsh reality gets the point across. "
574,To me it seems that he never wanted an open relationship but did it for you. Not a good idea btw. And now that he found someone who only wants to be with him he chose her over you. My guess is that he was hurt that you needed other sexual partners but went along with it out of love for you. And that love is now gone.
575,"Yes agreed. Screw being ""polite"" and not being rude, not offending someone. I did this type of stuff for a while and would end up in awkward or REALLY uncomfortable situations because I didn't want to be rude and upset someone or hurt their feelings. Some of them just do not understand subtle polite communication. I got super sick of it, I just straight up ignore them or tell them to bug off. 

And *do not* let them try to convince you that your boundaries are unreasonable. Don't let them call you a bitch or anything else because you don't want to flirt or play their games. They don't get to decide that for you. "
576,"Your GF may feel the resentment, because it is unfair to you or unfair to your kid.

She needs to understand that her resentment is doing no one any good, just the opposite in fact. On top of that, all that can be done has. You are no longer with her mother and they get a happy, stable, balanced, sane dad, who gets to do alls these great things with them.

The negativity is really needs to go away. And yeah it's not fair, but it is so much better than what it was. Better to focus on the good and what you can control."
577,Your husband completely made this up to see if you’d admit to it. If he was thinking about it for this long of course he’d remember who told him. 🙄
578,If you survived the drinking culture in Chicago then I'm sure you can survive elsewhere.
579,Yeah. Really weird set of circumstances.
580,"Until your parents kick your sister out, things will remain the same.

You need to look after your own needs.  Move out."
581,"My ex husband was the same. He'd come home from work and hop right on his computer to play games. He'd be on from morning until late night on weekends. We spent a lot of time in the same house, but not a lot of time together. He'd always be on the computer and I'd always be in the other room watching TV or doing a solo activity because he refused to log off for anything other than work. If I asked him to come watch something with me, or walk the dogs, or go out on a date, he'd either refuse or say ""okay, in a minute"".....over and over until it was hours later and I gave up asking. He then had the audacity to cite me being ""boring"" as one of his reasons for wanting to divorce. "
582,"My ex wanted to get my Chinese name tattooed on him a good 6 years after we started dating. We were sure we'd be forever. But I told him that if by some chance we did split, he'd regret it. He said no, it'd always remind him of his first love and all the amazing things he's learned and developed over our time together.

We split. He never got the tattoo. He is now very grateful he didn't get the tattoo because it would not be a great tattoo to remind him of his happy times, it would be his ex's name on hik forever.

She will most likely regret it. But it was her choice and she'll live with it."
583,"No, it is not your job to manage her feelings, no matter how nice she is. Don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm. "
584,Holy shit that toxic as fuck! You don't tell someone you don't like their breasts WHILE they're changing and when they didn't even ask. You need to sit him down and ask him how it would make him feel if you said he had a small dick the next time he was changing. Because holy shit that would upset him. Even if it's not true. He sounds very toxic. 
585,"He sounds insufferable. He’s a cheater, a serial liar, lazy, and worst of all, emotionally abusive. He’s dragging you down, down, down. 

Please leave and don’t look back. "
586,"We didn't have the same experiences, for me it would be.

 The guy is happy to get treated to meals and else but doesn't give anything back... This doesn't really look like someone in touch with reality, he seems pretty much unaware of the fact that this is uneven and a person with healthy social awareness would either insist on paying back OR tell her not to pay for him as he would rather be reponsible for himself only."
587,"And anon clearly went out of their way to find his current SO, then find OP's sister to message instead of his SO. 
I wonder if anon messaged her sister to possibly mitigate the natural whirlwind of emotions OP would likely experience initially from this news? Not an unbiased party, but one that is far more likely and willing to listen in the first place - if a conversation came from the first message. I would definitely reach out to the anon OP."
588,"I would be very concerned that he is married with a newborn and spreading rumors about *himself* having an affair with *you.* That's the behavior of a madman who feels he has nothing to lose.

Do your best to have as little contact with Mark as possible. Be pleasant, but not inviting. In any other scenario, I would say you should also tell his wife because she deserves to make her own decisions about whether or not she wants to be with and raise a child with a cheater. However, this is your career. The drama of another family is not worth risking your job over. It would be in your best interest to lay low.

If Mark continues to make problems for you at work, document everything emails, texts, etc. and take it to HR. However, nepotism makes this a tricky situation. Bringing down the CEO's son will more than likely be an impossible battle for you to win. That said, if it gets to this point, you should also prepare to look for a new job.
"
589,"It is such a ridiculous and huge amount of pressure these days that everyone needs to have some grand passion.  People are all over the spectrum with hobbies and passions and the lack of them does not always indicate lack of depth, or character, or interests, or whatever.  

Some people are super even keeled and never get ""passionate"" about much in life (my mom being one) and it doesn't mean they won't love you deeply, care for you, and be fiercely loyal.  It doesn't mean they won't get interested in and excited about doing things with you.   My mom has always only ever had one or two friends she put effort into maintaining friendships with, and this suited her just fine.  Nothing is wrong with her at all.  My Dad is super outgoing, energetic, has loads of active hobbies and way more friends.  They have been getting along just great for over 35 years.

Other people jump around from hobby to hobby (this is me).  I get interested in something, do it for a few months, get bored and switch to something else.  This is not a flaw or lack of passion or lack of commitment.  It's just how  I'm wired.   There is an EXCELLENT TedTalk by Emily Wopnick about this topic.  I suggest you check it out!"
590,"I actually stopped reading when you said he pinned you down on the bed.

Everything you are doing is excusing, rationalizing, and normalizing his terrible behavior.

He rationalizes it to get away with it. You say it back to yourself to avoid the painful, difficult task of leaving.

He will never get better, and your daughter will grow up thinking this behavior is normal and find someone just like him. 

Leave as soon as you have an exit strategy."
591,"There is a bias about young boys being groomed. He is being groomed by her. Let's put it in this context, even though it is exactly the same thing, this was your 20 year old male friend talking to a 15 year old girl for a year (so since she was 14), would you want this man as your friend? Your girlfriend is a direct tie to this woman. She has said she is her ""best friend"" and she is not taking ""sides"".... This woman will be in your life. The fact that your girlfriend will not tell her best friend what she is doing is wrong should send off alarm bells in your head. You want to marry your girlfriend? Do you really want this woman around your kids?"
592,"Hey, there. This is something I can relate to, and maybe help with. I'm 45M, and I've also Been There ^TM. Here's the tl;dr:

* You'll never have the *same* kind of relationships, as an adult, that you did during your younger years. I don't mean *at all* that you'll never have great relationships -- you will! -- but it will help you right now if you accept that these relationships *will be different*, in texture, in intensity, and in number.
* No one actually wants to be ""friends"" as an adult. (Well, mostly not. There are exceptions.) That's something that you have to build toward, and it takes time, and there are no shortcuts.
* It takes work. But once you figure out how to do the work, it's actually fairly joyful work.
* Try to set aside your own self-perception of being ""shy"" or ""introverted"". These labels aren't really useful. Usually, what this really means is that you don't enjoy some of the most common or prominent that ways people relate to each other. But you wouldn't be here if you weren't looking for some kind of overt connection. So instead of thinking of yourself as ""shy"", I would encourage you to re-think of yourself as ""not skilled in navigating certain social situations"". Skills can be developed. When you think of yourself as ""shy"", you put an inescapable, immutable label on yourself; it prevents growth.

Making friends in college is basically life on easy mode. You're all the same age, very few people have major relationships, no one has kids, you're thrown together for 30 hours a week in classrooms, cafeterias, labs, etc. It's almost impossible *not* to make friends. And I don't say that to disparage you -- like I said, I've been there! -- and I realize that right now it *does* feel hard to make friends, and I want to offer my empathy on that.

What I'm getting at is that, up until now, you haven't had to consciously think about what goes into creating a new friendship. It's so easy to think of it as ""I met this new person and we *like each other so much!*"" and then you're basically done, except for scheduling awesome activities. 

Weirdly enough, that's not really how things usually work. In my experience, here are the main things that help create and nurture a new friendship:

* Repeated contact. Ideally, *something* puts you two together, time after time. Like going to class, right? As an adult, if you have to schedule *every* interaction between you and your New Person, then one or both of you is going to get exhausted by this work, and the frequency will drop off at some point. And then you'll both go ""oh, she doesn't want to hang out with me"" and then it will drop off to nothing. And neither of you will know why. So: Find some *reason* to keep getting together. This is why people get into classes, sports, dancing lessons, yoga, movie clubs, etc. The environment *gives* you structure, and even though we *think* of structure as the antithesis of natural, fluid socializing, it's actually enormously beneficial. Imagine you've been going to a yoga class for three months, and you've *kinda* gotten to know 3 women; you talk before and after the class. One week you can't make it, so you skip. The next week you're back, and you were *missed* -- people remark on how you were gone, and now you're back, yay!
* A *lack* of high-intensity expectations. If you meet someone new, and you both like each other, it's really common to blast them with intense feelings of ""I LIKE YOU -- LET'S BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER NOW -- OK -- READY SET GO"". I think this can have the opposite effect of what you want, *even* when the other person wants roughly the same thing. These intense feelings inevitably create expectations, and (in both people) the fear of disappointment of those expectations. So: Try to build new relationships with a *minimum* of expectations, and (as above) with a lot of repeated contact. It will become obvious who wants a more intense friendship with you, and who wants to just remain an acquaintance.
* Nurture your acquaintances, even if you don't expect them to become close friendships. Reason #1: You may meet someone else through an acquaintance who *does* become important to you. I know one guy who is a ""super-node"" -- someone who knows EVERYBODY. He's an OK guy, and we'll never be more than acquaintances to each other, but through him I've met some really great people. There's nothing wrong with this -- I'm not ""using"" him or anything negative. If anything, I'm making his already-large network of friends even larger and even more close-knit, by forming relationships with other people that he knows.
* Think about what you can contribute to other people's lives. It's really easy to just think about what you want from a friendship. But what can you give to someone else? Can you make up a schedule for Movie Night, find out what people like to watch, and be the one who is hosting Movie Night? Can you organize a museum trip? This is work, and sometimes it will not be appreciated *but sometimes it will be*. People who take the initiative to set up social situations are taking risks, and are generally reaping the rewards, too. Find ways that you can be that person.
* Keep moving forward. Accept that old approaches are no longer the best fit to your new stage in life. Also, I found socializing in my late 20s to be rather frustrating, but oddly enough my 30s (and even my 40s) have been positively *filled* with opportunities. But I had to figure this out -- that I had to learn new habits, find new ways to meet people, and new ways to appreciate them. None of them felt the same as in my early 20s, and I missed that for a long time. Also, if an existing friendship of yours isn't working and you can't find a way to fix it -- mourn the end of that relationship (or that phase of that relationship), but then move on.

Ok, this is turning into a novel. Sorry not sorry. Long story short, I *strongly* encourage you to find activities that give you regular, scheduled reasons to interact with people. Art classes. Softball. Movie clubs. Cookbook clubs. Wine &amp; truffles club. Yoga class. Weight-lifting class. (Seriously, lots of women have had great experiences learning to lift weights and meeting other women that way.) Volleyball. Sailing classes. Mountaineering / hiking.

A huge, crucial part of this is finding ways that you can be valuable or useful to other people. Lots of club / team activities have this flavor, where *you being there* means that someone *else* has a better experience. It's addictive, for everyone concerned.
"
593,"Exactly. One thing cheaters almost always do is rewrite the history of their relationship in order to justify their cheating. So they'll tell you that you were a bad partner, that you didn't pay them enough attention, or that you didn't do enough chores or look after the kids often enough, or that they never really loved you and they need to go and ""be happy"". 

The thing is, even if there is a grain of truth to any of these claims, they're always *heavily* distorted and exaggerated because the cheater can't face the truth that by choosing to lie, betray, and destroy their family, they've become the bad guy in their own story. 

OP, get in contact with your lawyer and protect yourself. Whether or not your wife ever waked up and smells her own bullshit is not a question any of us here have the answer to, but you can't wait around for it or even try to convince her of it. She's living in a delusional fantasy and has made you into the enemy of her happiness. "
594,"I would date a guy who formerly identified as gay, especially given your age. However, I wouldn't want to be his test subject for figuring out if he's sexually attracted to women. "
595,"Yo this person knows what’s up, get the hell away from that dude ASAP"
596,"I was about to type this. 4 months of being completely immobile is serious overkill. 

I’ve spent my life around athletes and sports and I’ve seen more than a few people go through ACL tears. Most are scooting around with crutches within days, and the more hard headed ones are walking with a brace between 3-4 months."
597,"Honestly I think it might be a good idea for OP to call a domestic violence hotline and talk the situation out with them--get their advice on how to help her keep safe in worst-case scenarios.

In the US: 800-799-7233"
598,I'd have done the same thing if my brother (who turns 14 next month) is in the same situation with a 20 year old girl. 
599,"&gt; Needhelp164 : ""*...something not right about a married man messaging her every evening... She immediately got pretty defensive/angry with me and asked her what I was accusing her of and how it was purely platonic and began to cry... she admitted that he would call her beautiful all the time and they both put kisses on their texts... I checked her phone and in 5 minutes I'd picked up on a lot more comments from him for example ""how fucking hot she looked in her dress"" and ""how she gave him naughty thoughts"" and ""how when she was coming in early he was excited to have her to himself"" ...She doesn't believe he was trying to make a sexual advance and it was just ""banter""... when I speak to her im made to feel like I'm overreacting...*""

1\. If she truly believed such ""banter"" was not inappropriate, she wouldn't hide it.

2\. If those same messages were coming from someone whose attention she *didn't* want, she would put a stop to it.

3.\ If you were carrying on like this with someone else, I doubt she would like it.

The more you tolerate this, the less she'll respect you."
600,"You’re 27, I say leave him and find someone better. He cheated on you multiple times, and gave you multiple STDs, one that made you infertile. Why would you want to be with him? He can still be a part of your child’s life and be a good father but you don’t have to be in a romantic relationship with the fuckwad. Ultimately you’re doing yourself and your child a disservice by staying with him. Your daughter will grow up seeing you two in a bad relationship and it’ll effect her. My parents stayed in a terrible, mutually abusive marriage for my sake and I was actually happy when they got divorced when I was 17. 

You’ll find someone else. Don’t stay with him because you’re afraid to be lonely. Being lonely is better than being with someone who gives you diseases. 

I’m sorry that this happened OP. I hope whatever you choose to do brings you and your daughter happiness. But please don’t stay with someone you hate out of obligation. "
601,"You’re not ridiculous at all for keeping a journal! You have a right to write whatever you want (including vents, rants, or exaggerated versions of events) and for all of that to stay private.

Unfortunately, because your mom is so nosy and controlling, you can’t keep a physical journal she can access. I would recommend using an online journal that is password-protected.

If you still see your therapist, talk to them about this serious invasion of your privacy immediately. Your mother is actively setting back your mental health by undermining your access to things that help you cope.

Tell your mom in no uncertain terms (if you don’t fear for your safety, of course) that what she read was creative writing, not accurate versions of events, and extremely private. You get to be mad at her for as long as you want, frankly."
602,This. He's not going to still be into his ex. But he'll never forget what his brother did to him and has revised the closeness of your relationship ever since. 
603,"Yeah.  4 months is enough time to make a decision,  stop wasting time and move on."
604,"&gt;  I'm not uncomfortable with talking about sex, but i think he's being a bit excessive. 

Say exactly this.

A lot of the comments here are edging along the line of ""boys will be boys!! he's young!!"" but he is 18 years old and capable of respecting boundaries and not only speak to you with a sexual tone or context.

I'm a 20 year old female. I *was* your boyfriend in my past relationship, in all honesty. I loved sex, wanted to talk about all kinds of sex, flirted in sexual context. My boyfriend told me, ""hey. i feel like we're *just* talking about sex all the time and it is getting annoying."" And because I am a human being who listens and respects, I changed my tune! And a while later when that situation reversed, he changed his tune as well. Which is what your boyfriend should have done the first time you expressed this to him. 

Doesn't matter that it was his first time. Doesn't matter that he is 18. Doesn't matter that he is a male. Does. Not. Matter. 

Tell him, ""boyfriend, sex is great and I do not mind talking about it, but you are talking about it excessively and it bothers me. just because we've had sex doesn't mean our entire  relationship should be about it, now."" 

If he apologizes, again, but doesn't change his conversation, again, consider whether you want to be with someone who you need to ask for something 92374387 times before that request is respected."
605,"What's stopping you from taking it further?

""It's naptime, so it's time for this visit to be over. It was so lovely having you! Bye!""

""Oh, thanks for stopping by- I'm able to be social for about an hour then (baby) and I have plans/things to do/an appointment.""

And practice when she comes over unexpectedly- ""oh shoot, I wish you'd checked in first, that's probably best from now on. We're not available today I'm afraid.""

If you need to that first time, then start getting ready to leave and leave to go somewhere! Even if it's just the park, you get out and go somewhere that isn't entertaining her.

You can also practice with texts- if she asks if she can come over, say ""today's no good for us!""

By the way, babies have lots of appointments, and she does not have to know that appointment means alone time."
606,"I really like that expression, “[insert whomever] ‘nothings’ you”. It really does sum up what she was saying, and explains the cold, almost detached, way she said it. But yeah, OP needs to begin to move on, his wife is way ahead of him."
607,"Well, I did send applications to Univerities and got accepted into 2 nearby and I’m getting financial aid so I am getting a bachelor’s degree then working full time  after high school"

609,"You did the right thing. You have fundamental incompatibilities with John, like having children. Being the military may be admirable, but it doesn't entitle him to whatever woman he wants.  If Jane is so concerned, she is welcome to date him. I would be pulling back from your friendship with both (John because he dismisses your conviction about having children and thinks he can ""change"" you, and Jane because of her attitude towards your ability to say no to a guy).

610,"Is there any specific reason that you think this grown woman, as an owner of a vagina presumably for the last 50 years, is incapable of managing her own sexual health?

Yeah, I live in Crazyland."
612,He tells me how crazy I am and I worry about the police believing him. Turning him in is going to trigger more anger.  I feel like I can’t win.  Before this I never understood why women stayed in abusive relationships.

I agree with /u/drivebyjustin, his sex on demand and money to buy whatever he wants while he distracts you from your job do not paint any kind of ""sexy"" picture."
614,"I do not have a good relationship with my parents, they were and as far as I know still are addicts. Their lives revolved around drugs, drinking, and being in and out of jail on drug offenses. I worked hard to get into college, then went no contact once I left because as soon as they got wind I was leaving they started hassling me to promise I'd send them money from my student loan refunds. I met my husband in college and it was so nice to see a parent who cared about their kid. I hadn't expected it would turn out to be like all this."

617,"And when she asks why it's suddenly locked all the time (she seems like the shameless type who would do that), give her a little speech about how weird and off-putting it was that random people kept coming over to your house and letting themselves into your private space, so you had to be the mature one and just make it impossible for them."
618,"At the time they told me they didn’t want me going to the high school I planned on attending because it was a “horrible” and dangerous school. They went so far as to drive me out to an old abandoned building and swear that’s where it was located. Come to find out later it’s one of the best schools in the state (teachers told me that at the time but I foolishly decided to trust my parents). As to the rest I don’t know, I guess they don’t like me very well for whatever reason. I can’t think of any other explanation."

621,"You and your brother are in your 30's. Why don't you do this by taking your mother right out of the equation? She's not capable of handling this without making it personal to \*her\*. 

Your brother doesn't need a caretaker who's looking in the mirror and making his pain about her 24/7, so he needs to arrange for an outside caretaker who won't let your mother's personal demons intrude on his healing. YOU will feel worse than your brother, so you  don't need your mom wailing about how bad \*she\* feels about this, and why didn't you listen to her-- So you get your own caretakers as well, and no, she can't be one. She's made her need to be front and center of this MEDICAL EMERGENCY clear: she's just a bit too deluded to be useful. 

So she gets sidelined by two adults who need to be in control of their own medical decisions and healing. She's put on a low-info diet immediately, you and your brother both work out the logistics and set them in stone and then email her with your decisions and a warning that she will be held responsible for any and every attempt to make this about her or to take over your care. Period. 

This is a boundary issue, and you won't feel well enough, either of you, to fight with her. So have your caretakers prepped, know what all your decisions will be if the situation degrades, and have it all in writing. Change the locks, lock down your info with a code word, be prepared to have anyone who tries to contravene the doctors' instructions removed with no more than a look.

Your brother is lucky, and I'm very impressed at your steely determination to help him. Use that steel on your mother as well."
622,"Oh, we're fwb but I'm gay! 

Wtf kind of logic is that?! I'm confused as much as poor OP.... "
623,"I’m also a twin, so I understand the jealousy aspect. But birthdays are always discussed as what WE want to do because it’s both of our days!! I know I would be hurt if my parents did not ask me what I wanted to do or continued to pay more attention to my twin. 

I’m sorry your parents are doing this, but I hope you know this doesn’t reflect on who you are. This reflects on them, and you deserve better. You don’t mention anything negative with your relationship to you twin, so I would suggest putting more time into that relationship. You mention that you have talked to your parents, and they have disregarded your feelings. Once when I felt like my parents were not listing to me regarding a family issue, I wrote them a letter and had them sit down and read it together. This allowed me to edit and clarify my points, and it allowed them to sit down and process the words I was saying without jumping to defend themselves. If you wish to continue a healthy relationship with them then this might be another way to reach out. I wish the best for you xx "
624,"Talk to him about it. I once dated a girl I thought I was completely incompatible with and possibly not attracted to in the bedroom. After talking we both understood each other's needs better and the sex got so much better. Amazingly better. 

Your mileage may vary but it's worth talking to them candidly about what you want more of or less of in your sexual relationship. Don't lose too much sleep over it. If at the end of the day it doesn't improve, it's okay to have a great friend and move on to find someone who's a better romantic partner. "
625,"Are you sure his ex was the abusive one? I'm wondering if his ex's ""abuse"" really consisted of refusing to put up with his tantrums and BS."
626,"Wow... your fiancee doesn't seem to give a shit about this guy. It sounds like he's just some ""puppy"" for her to play with. That's sorta fucked up IMO. "

631,I’m so sorry but I have to agree with the above statement. You deserve someone who wants to be with you. After 2.5 years for him to say “you may not be the one”  is a slap in the face.
632,"Is she scared that she will get fired if she says anything to this manager or HR? She might be playing along because she's never dealt with this type of harassment, especially from a superior. It is NOT easy to just say ""no"" to abusive bosses. Her career is on the line. 

You two obviously have some issues to work through but please make sure you offer her support and help her to speak to HR. This needs to be reported so she is left alone. And then you both can have the space to work through this together. 

Good luck! "
633,"Do you want to be married to someone who makes those choices? No. That leaves you three options: 

1. He changes his mind. 
2. You change your mind. 
3. Divorce. 

You can't make him change. He doesn't want to change. That leaves only options 2 and 3. 

You don't want to divorce him, so you need to accept he's made up his mind. That means changing your life plans according to this decision: 

* He will likely die before you do. Start accounting for that when you make life plans. 
* If you DO die in a tragic accident, will he be able to look after your child? Account for that in your life plans too. 
* He will likely have health problems that are expensive. Set up a savings account. 
* He will be a bad influence to your child. Account for that when you're planning for your child's health education. 
* He will likely use a larger food/alcohol budget than you do. Plan for that when you're planning your groceries. 
* People with physical health problems are more likely to have or develop mental health problems. Be on the lookout for anxiety and depression, and be aware he might need help with those things. 
* Consider the possibility that he continues to gain weight. Decide in advance what you will do about that, and if there is a maximum level of obesity that you will not tolerate. 

I think, also, you should consider if you and your husband have different values. For example, my husband also has health problems, and he doesn't always manage them perfectly either. We have talked about it a lot, though, and I accept when he says that his life wouldn't be enjoyable to him if he didn't have a certain amount of freedom in what he chooses to do. An extra 10 years of misery isn't worth making his whole life miserable. So we accept the increased risk, while still trying to *reduce* the risk that he does have. Eating bad food, occasionally, is definitely not good for him. However, the trade-off is greatly increased enjoyment of life, and we accept that trade. He also tries to eat more healthy food than he used to, which is part of reducing the risk. 

Maybe (if you can get your husband to discuss it with you), you could try making very minor changes to improve his health. Instead of ""Quit drinking"", you could say ""Switch to a different drink with lower calories"". Or ""Keep most of the alcohol out of the fridge so you can only drink a certain amount before you have to stop."" This is obviously not a perfect solution, but a small change is better than nothing, and small changes can be built on to achieve larger changes (e.g. once he's switched to drinking a drink with lower calories and that doesn't bother him anymore, he can make another small change and start alternating his low-calorie drink with glasses of water). And at that point he's drinking a lower-calorie drink and he's drinking less overall and that is a big reduction in his alcohol intake. For my husband and I in trying to eat healthier this has been very effective. Neither of us are really into diet or exercise, but looking at what we already do and changing it slightly to be more healthy has worked pretty well. "
634,"&gt;He says he’s been thinking that we might be happier if we go our separate ways since I can’t drink and he likes to.

If he actually said this, full stop on moving to Texas.  Considering your dilemma has several, blindingly obvious compromises and solutions which he should have thought of, I think it's likely something else is going on here and he's looking for excuses to end the relationship."

I've had a hard time not judging him for the mind-numbing content he views to escape his real life."
639,"Perfect.

I laughed a little at the OP because of course, trains is all the autistic person in my life loves. 

One thing to remember is that people on the spectrum sometimes not only fixate on a subject BUT also use it as a go-to subject when nervous or feeling socially inadequate. It's ""safe"".

Please, just be explicit and say what you mean. Direct. It's not socially rude. R/autism is full of adults like him who wish friends could just use words that match feelings. It is a nightmare for them to be constantly ghosted because they didn't speak the ""language"". "
640,"I empathize with you. Most people have no idea what we do, and it's almost insulting when it's your family.

641,"Why would someone make an account to msg your sister, why not directly msg you?"
642,"Yes, it's incredibly rude to leave you passed out and go out without even communicating it when it was supposed to be YOUR night together. I don't think that number seems low when they're already spending so much time with the project, gym etc. Also, how does that compare with the number of times you and him have gone out and done something fun (had a meal, etc) in the past month? He should be investing in you."
643,"""I had to be painfully distant to make him get the picture and leave"" No, you didn't. You had to say that his jokes/comments were making you uncomfortable and to stop. Then ask him to leave if he continues. Please don't feel you are being rude or presumptuous. We are conditioned to please, but you must learn to set your own boundaries and say ""no"". I'm sorry saying that is awkward for you, but they are actually putting you in this awkward position. They are girlfriendzoning you. 

I don't want to make a whole feminist thing of this, but you need to be straight to prevent one of them going too far and using ""she never said no. I thought she wanted to"" as a defense. Sorry, men, I do like you but consent is confusing."
644,"Yep. I’m a Dan Savage fan, and a believer in his “campsite rule.” My ex was undocumented and lived in a laundry room when I met him, and now he has papers, a full-time job, and an apartment. He gets to go see his family in Guatemala regularly, and he hadn’t seen them in years before he got his green card. He still wishes we were together, but he cheated on me repeatedly so I had to leave him. That’s my goal for this relationship too. Either we stay together for the long haul, or I leave him in a much better situation than I found him in. Thanks for the comment."
645,"I think you're misunderstanding your dynamic here. 

Your assets are his assets. His assets are your assets. You may have separate bank accounts within your own relationship, but your physical assets are just as legally intertwined as you two are. 

Outside of that, your husband sounds like he wants to share his success and happiness with you fully. 

Ask him what about the old car makes him want to replace it. He might be thinking that it's getting up there in miles and is worried about you getting stranded on the side of the road at night if it starts having mechanical issues.

Personally, I also take a bit of pride in my ability to provide for my family and I *love* splurging a little on my wife and kids, whether it's a $200 dinner a couple times a year or tablets for the kids or insisting my wife get the best possible product/service for what she wants so she can be thoroughly happy with it. I share their joy and love knowing I was able to help them feel that. "
646,"For a while I had a reccurring sex dream about someone I HATED and wasn't even physically attracted to at all and I would wake up feeling disgusting and guilty and think ""man I hope I never have that happen again"" only to have it happen again. Human brains are ruthless."

652,"It's you. She cleans, asks what you want to do and eat. Thereby giving you every chance to communicate something simple which you haven't done. Oh no she offers you snacks, what a horrible person. Say ""no thank you"" and get over it if she asks again. She's being nice and probably offering over and over because she's picking up frustration from you and trying to fix it by being nice. And you want to play audio books when you go to sleep? Ever consider that might keep her awake? Be considerate and use earphones. Are you a loud masturbator? Are you unable to keep the cat from opening the door when you do? That really shouldn't be so difficult to handle.

You aren't ready to compromise or communicate. You need your own space. Do you each have a place to retreat to for ""me time""? Are you able to parallel play? Each person working on their own project or activity in the same space?

Sorry for the harsh answer dude, you did ask ""is it me""."

655,"So, this is one of those times where neither party is really at fault off the bat - right up until one party dismissing the wishes of the other.  Whether its about cars, sex, or That One Time Aunt Gerry Once Ran Over a Cat, no one wants to feel that a topic is dominating the relationship.

This is where boundaries come into play.  If you're on the phone, you are allowed to remind him ""I explicitly requested that you stop bringing this up - if you can't do that, I'm not continuing the conversation"" and *follow through*.

If you're physically together and he doesn't stop bringing it up, leave or ask him to leave.

It all comes down to you being made uncomfortable; its less about the topic of sex and more about your discomfort and repeated requests for the topic to stop that are being ignored.  

At this point, he will either knock it off or he is free to find a partner that does wish to engage in more of what *he* wants. "
656,She's not the only one you should cut off. Your parents are pieces of sh*t themslves. Maybe they like her so much because they see a kinship in her being a terrible person. 
657,"I disagree that you're not an example! I honestly teared up a little bit reading this because I'm so happy for the both of you. You communicated your needs in a direct and respectful way, and he stepped up and not only met but exceeded your expectations. You sound like a lovely couple and I'm glad you shared your story as an example of what a healthy relationship looks like."
658,I will apologize in that way. I feel bad about saying aggressive things anyway. I don't like to fight even though she often gets on my nerves.
659,"It sounds like you're overwhelmed by going zero to family real quick. You can do what other families do in a situation like this, be there for your dad and his girlfriend and hope for the best. Good luck and I hope she has a speedy recovery. "
660,You’re absolutely right.
661,"&gt;She says that she wants to explore her sexuality and that it would be cruel for me to stop her from doing so

OK, but you want a monogamous relationship with her, and by her standards she's being ""cruel"" for stopping you doing so. Her having different needs from you isn't wrong, what **is** wrong is her trying to guilt or manipulate you into somehow being the bad guy for not just being OJ with her doing what she wants. That's a total double standard and she's only thinking about her needs, not yours, and only thinking her needs matter, not yours.

So at best you're incompatible, at worst she's entitled and demanding and insensitive and selfish. What you do is compromise as much as you're willing to, if that's not enough for her you break up. You can't be the only one compromising or making effort, and if she's not willing to value your feelings as much as her own, she's a pretty shitty partner."
662,"Thank you guys for your opinion, that really helped me, pretty much a validation from what I was already thinking (breaking up).

I didn’t give a better explanation, but truly my whole point was not the wedding itself. We basically live a married life. I do believe and would love to get married one day, to me it’s not about the celebration or rings and more about to validate what both want in that relationship (we both come from families with long lasting successful marriages, I sort of look into this and see that’s what I want for me). Wanting that from an almost 3 year partner is not unreasonable.

He’s happy to be settled the way we are and it’s fair enough, although we’re old enough to know what we both want and to truly commit. Some guys will never commit, some will only do with the right person, which is not me in this case.

I’m very disappointed with the fact that he hid that from me, for a long time he gave some good clues that he was interested in getting married one day (sometimes even my mistaken in saying “I’m married to you” instead of “I’m dating you”, by calling “wifey” and so on). Marriage was always a deal breaker and kids were not, right in the begginging he made clear he didn’t want kids and I was ok and said that I’d easily give up on kids but getting married was something I wouldn’t give up on, and he said it was fair enough, which I took as we were on the same page.

Just after when we got our 2 year anniversary that I asked about serious plans as marriaged, buying a house etc it was when he finally said that he wasn’t ready and he wasn’t still sure I was not the one. He cried saying that, and said that he feels I’m the one bit he’s practical way of seeing things tells him to see our relationship going tough situations as a last proof that I’m the one. I’m not a videogame that he needs to go to levels until he gets to the final stage to make sure I’ve ticked all the boxes, not after almost 3 years. 

I’ve been respectful to the amazing relationship we have always had, but I’ve got to be true to myself and not settle for less than what I thing I deserve, and so does he. He needs to find someone who doesn’t want to commit too, so they’ll make each other happy. "
663,"When he said cooking and cleaning was your job, did he actually mean that? Do you also have a full time job while still coming home and completely take care of the house? There’s a phenomenon called “the second shift” that you should take a glance at. Sounds like his behavior that is completely unfair to you, and you absolutely shouldn’t need to deal with his bs at all. "
664,One of those swinging axe on a rope traps will get the hint across.
665,WTF are you talking about. Eat the fucking chili and put the leftovers in the fridge to heat up tomorrow. This can’t even be real. 
666,If he’s really that disabled he does not need to be in bars hanging around with adults who are drinking.  He should be in an environment where he’s doing things that are appropriate for his mental age not his physical age and your girlfriend should know this if she really is interested in helping him.  
667,"Shit, I'm worried Steve is about to get sexually assaulted by this loon.

668,"But she has a boyfriend she’s been with since like 18? Why would she be jealous if she’s happy in her relationship? I just always considered her a friend until all of this happened. 

Exactly, I love myself very much for who I am as a person. I don’t need a husband to validate me. If anything a partner should only enhance your life."
669,"hi, i'm a person who became rapidly disabled at 30 and only seem to get worse. i spent the first few years insisting my husband leave me because he shouldn't have to live this horrid life and he said he meant it when he said in sickness and in health. after a while i started to believe him when he told me he was going to stay and he doesn't mind helping me and taking care of me. the advice i want to give you is this, and two-fold: believe your boyfriend when he says he's staying and he doesn't mind taking care of you. trust him to be honest if it ever changes. just because this is happening, your place in the relationship hasn't been devalued. if we constantly insist they leave or they'd be better off with someone else there is a risk it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. accept his love and support. second: PLEASE seek therapy. becoming disabled after a life of functioning like an average person, is incredibly jarring. your whole world changes, your self worth drops, you're scared and anxious. seek help to work through the panic and fear and sadness reach out to friends, find a support group or subreddit. people going through the same or similar things help you feel less alone. we have to stick together because we all deserve people in our lives, in whatever capacity, who really understand what we are going through. there are therapists i believe you can work with via phone even for when you cannot leave the house. it is the greatest gift you could give yourself right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

i wish you the best of luck on your MRI and i hope and pray they find a physical reason. even if that reason is chronic aura migraines. that's a real and valid illness.  lastly, please feel free to reach out to me if you need someone to listen. though my disability isn't the same as yours, i went through this sort of thing myself. to paraphrase a story from 'the west wing', i've been down here before and i know the way out."
670,"You: I wanted to see you this weekend. I was hurt that you didn't want to come to the gym with me.

You: How about... those things I just said?

Him: I like skiing. Hate the gym. I guess I'll never know how to make you feel better. It will remain a mystery."
671,"I'm genuinely all about open and direct honesty. But I like this. 

OP, just don't wear em next time you see her and go from there. This doesn't feel like it needs to be a ""sit down, i need to tell you something"" situation. 

Do not wait a few months until you feel like she now likes you enough. Do not start ""progressively wearing shorter lifts."" Both of those things are problematic and more of a problem than the actual shoe lifts themselves. 

Just don't wear them. Take it from there. 

And perhaps work on accepting your height."
672,"I’m gonna come in on this sideways because I’ve noticed something in your replies. You work seven days a week? And your wife works as well? **And **you have kids ?!?

I would suggest that you guys are stressed out of your minds, even if you’re holding it together, that is just too much goddamn work. One of the most straightforward stress responses is to release cortisol. I would suggest nothing you do or eat is going to make a massive amount of difference unless you change the way you’re living.

I can suggest all kinds of fun things for you guys like salsa or swing dancing: and there’s loads of different food approaches like Keto which is delicious, or intermittent fasting which is really straightforward and requires no changes to your basic diet. But none of these changes will help you if you working seven days a week.


With you working seven days a week, it means your wife isn’t getting a break as well – because she’s looking after the kids on the weekend while you work. And neither of you are getting a proper break.

If I were your wife,  I’d be holding my life together with junk food as well!


Exercise is easy when you have leisure time and access to hiking trails and outdoor living and a gym nearby and salsa school round the corner. Meal prep is easy when you have spare time. What I’m getting very strongly from your comments is that you have no spare time to do any of this stuff.

Is there any way you can get a different job? Is there any where you could move that would give you an opportunity to maintain your lifestyle but work less ? I know this may sound like a pipe dream, but please consider it. I think right now that a diet and exercise regime is just one more thing that you and your wife have to squeeze in to your non-existent spare time, while you’re both exhausted. "
673,"Plus she was 10 minutes in in a 20 minutes assessment. If he “needed” to say goodbye he could’ve waited a few minutes.

But it’s just semantics because his reason are shit and kinda gaslighting?! (He told her she made the goodby rule but she don’t remember this. Don’t know if it qualify as gaslighting but it’s definitely manipulative. Also saying she turns into a beast if he doesn’t uffffff)"
674,I have nothing against weed.  What I do have a problem with is self medicating to mask a mental health problem that needs to be addressed by professionals.  It seems like you need to know what’s real and everyone’s true feelings when he’s not high.  I don’t think I would be happy with someone who’s high  all the time.  It would feel like living in a fake world.

676,"Other than the issue with his parenting, things were really great between us. He even was planning on proposing before the accident. He used to be super caring and we have a lot of fun together. The car accident really rocked our world and we have struggled to regain some normalcy. I'm better at adapting and working through adverse events than he is. Seems like he's trying to grasp at whatever he can to try to feel better instead of dealing with his problems.

677,"This is going to be blunt. Don’t take this the wrong way, but have you considered seeking therapy for anxiety? This is not really a normal way to respond to this issue. Either go to a new coffee shop or just except that she’s going to pester you when you go into the other one. It’s fine to not click with other people and not want to continue hanging out, but let’s be clear here: you made the plans, you were a “nervous wreck” beforehand (seriously this isn’t a normal response to such a thing), and then you canceled the plans, but now that she wants to hang out again, *you’re* being *bullied*? Come on now. This is just ridiculous."

They're gonna have to talk properly about this, but this isn't something you can really forget even if op's fiancee can forgive."
691,"I could not relate more with this. My son's dad doesn't, and has never paid child support. He can't keep a consistent job to save his soul. After we split, he went on to have 2 more children with 2 more women. He sees his son every other weekend, and on school breaks, as he lives an hour away from the school, and can't get him to school half of the week. I have paid for everything for my son, his entire life. Daycare, school, extra curricular activities, clothing etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance and I have been together going on 4 years. He is GREAT with my son, and cares for him as his own. Has coached teams, done homework and shared in the good, bad and ugly sides of parenting. He went through a phase where he made similar comments about 'us' paying for everything for my son. I gently reminded him that if he had any issue at all with paying for anything, I would pay for it myself. I have never so much as asked him to financially support us, in any way. After a while, the comments got really old, and wore on me, the same way they are wearing on you. 

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion, and what worked for me, was to have a sit down conversation, and explain that you have made the conscious decision to accept YOUR parenting role, as it is. You are okay with the extra things you do, the extra money you spend, and the extra (emotional and financial) support you offer to your children. Tell her it isn't up for debate. That you don't appreciate the comments made about what your ex does and does not do for your children, because it isn't your responsibility. **YOUR** responsibility is to play **YOUR** role, in **YOUR** children's life. Whatever role **YOU** decide to play, whether your girlfriend deems it to be appropriate in comparison to your ex wife, or not.  It's hard, because the 'step' parent may feel like they are filling some of the gaps that the other parent is not, but the reality of the situation is, they decided that, when they decided to be with someone who has children from a previous relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, your girlfriend has to realize that expressing these things to your ex likely won't change her, but just create animosity between the two of you. If you don't have a problem with the way things are currently being handled, it isn't something that needs to be addressed. "
692,"If you're asking for permission to end this marriage, you've got mine!

Financial abuse is a very real thing, but even if you don't look at this situation through the lens of abuse, it's still 100% okay to decide that it's not acceptable to you. He doesn't need to be abusive, for you to decide that this marriage isn't working for you and you'd be happier without a husband who is more like a teenager dependent than a partner. 

It sounds like everyone around you (even his own parents) is waiting for you to walk away from this man. 

Pack your bag now, while you're calmer and can remember to take important paperwork or items. If he has quit or expresses the intention to quit, take a few days. You know he's manipulative. You need some space to plan your next steps and make clear-headed decisions. 

Frankly, you don't even need to wait for the next time he quits. There is a fair chance he might realize how close to the end you are, and stall. You don't owe him a 100th chance. If you're done, take a deep breath, and be done. "
693,"I wouldn't open with humour, but hopefully he'll see the humour in it. It's like a Seinfeld plot.

Tell him what you've said here (maybe leave out the part about not being interested in him at first!) and apologise for not 'fessing up sooner. You know this isn't normal behaviour and you're super embarrassed for letting it get to this point.

Unless he's super uptight, he'll get over it.

FWIW, I think quite a lot of people have experience with a dumb lie getting out of control. As long as you're not habitually untruthful or crazy, it's not the end of the world."

698,Ummmmm I would be VERY cautious about having children with someone who is anti-vax. Have you guys talked about whether or not you'd vaccinate your kids? Because that is not a small issue at all.

700,"I would suggest that you just let it go unless she brings it up again. Tbf it does sound like a joke, or at the very least just drunken fuckery. I doubt she was serious. If she brings it up again certainly shut it down, but I think its incredibly likely you'll never hear another word about it again. I think bringing it up unprompted will just open a can of worms that doesnt need to be opened."
701,"I’m sorry, but your husband’s a dick. He’s actively using a DATING app, refuses to stop despite you being heartbroken over it, shames you and withholds intimacy because of your weight, tries to force you into sex acts you don’t want, and is also a hypocrite. Oh, and he mocks you for standing up to his bullshit.

You owe it to yourself to put an end to this because clearly he has zero respect for you. Just get out before you waste any more time on this ass.

704,"He's showing what I'd call a frightening lack of empathy. He  calls her selfish for expressing even the smallest need if it doesn't perfectly align with what he wants. 

OP, does he lack empathy in other areas too? Do you find that when you make mistakes, he's unwilling to accept your explanations, but when he makes them, it's because he has a really good reason (for instance, if you snap at him after a bad day at work, it's because you're a terrible person who doesn't love him, but if he snaps at you it's because he's under a lot of stress and so it's not his fault)? 

Everyone is like this to some extent because we all know our own feelings better than we know other people's. But in my experience, people who are simultaneously A:highly sensitive to how others treat them, and B:highly insensitive to the feelings of others are really, really hard to live with. 

If this sounds like your boyfriend...I would consider rethinking the relationship, because people with these traits have a hard time being in an equitable partnership."
705,It’s so worrying she doesn’t want to ‘make him mad’. Like she’s done something wrong. Like she needs his approval. This has me feeling so bad for her
706,when you're blocked you don't receive bounce-back texts. it just looks as if the person you're texting is ignoring your texts. 
707,"Have you been in counseling to address this? Because even if you don't ever see him again, you do NOT deserve to think of yourself that way for the rest of your life."

709,"&gt;he’s not ready to get married because he’s not sure I’m the one.


Telling someone that you don't want to get married because you're not sure that she's the person he wants to commit your life to certainly gives the impression that you're not interested in having a committed relationship with her. "
710,This doesn't sound like love. This sounds like an addiction to the drama you two create together.
711,"So this is no longer about a birth control disagreement. Your main problem is your husband believes in **feels over reals**, this is going to be a continuous problem in your relationship, particularly anything concerning children."
712,"&gt;to men, sex is just sex and isn’t intimate...

Logically, if she thinks this, she's simply never been loved.  :(

I would pity her.  

Most men prefer a meaningful monogamous relationship.  (hence, the number of men ""married""?  for, like, millennia now?)"
713,"&gt; I love this man so much, I love our family. Before ""Tom"" came along I was very nearly none functioning, he saw whatever in me and slowly got me comfortable to do things, leave the house, be sexual, eat... 

You really need therapy. Love is NEVER enough in a relationship and you should NOT be this dependent on an SO. This is not a healthy relationship model for you rkid.

&gt;  In moving, having my parents near, it will help, we are under so much stress here.... and everyone fucks up. 

Cheating (emotional and physical) doesn't just happen. It's a series of ""mistakes"" and shows a huge lack of communication. Why didn't your husband address the issues? Why didn't he make therapy a must for you? Why didn't he simply end it?

Bring it up with him in a casual way and just talk with him about it. From the sounds of it it doesn't seem like you've talked to him about it before. This obviously matters to you and it's likely he doesn't have any idea. It's reasonable for you to want him to treat you sometimes, but you need to communicate this with him"

728,"Great point.

A friend of mine went out with a guy recently who kept saying how grateful he was when she would offer to go dutch on dates. They'd just get one check and put two cards down. Neither is hurting for money and they're both having a couple drinks with the meal and having a good time, so she saw no reason to get entirely separate tickets. Except after a while.. it started to change.

He started ordering starters for himself, ordering fancy entrees like steak/veal parmesan/boiled seafood, ordering dessert. He wasn't rude and I'm sure she was welcome to eat any of these extra items if she wanted, but she didn't want them (she't not a heavy eater). When it came time for the ticket, he'd go their normal route of one check and putting down two cards. And then because she's a generous tipper, she'd end up spending MORE than him when her meal costs far less than his.

This of course can happen accidentally.. but based on other factors of his personality, it became clear to my friend that this dude was doing this intentionally. He isn't much of a cook and dines out almost every night, so we think he realized if he asked her to dinner regularly, he could get his meal at a steep discount with her footing half the bill.

/rambling - But I agree with you. This guy my friend knew hasn't talked very highly of women he has dated around with and I know he used to use dating apps frequently.. so I get the feeling he was enacted some type of revenge through these actions.

I do not believe that any person should be required to pay for another person all of the time, regardless of gender. But I do think that in a relationship where neither person is genuinely strapped for money, treating each other is a thing that happens. Especially birthdays, holidays, etc. It doesn't mean that one person needs to be ""ahead"" of the other. Just that he can treat sometimes, you can treat sometimes, and you can go dutch sometimes. It is something small that can make a person feel cared for."
729,"Dude, mentally challenged people can be VERY dangerous to deal with. He doesn't have to intentionally hurt her to hurt her. He's like a big puppy, right? Have you ever left a puppy alone in a house without supervision? They can wreck some shit up. What happens if he's at your wedding and reacts badly to seeing you marry her and creates a scene? What if he runs up and tries to get in the middle of you two because of how upset he is he's ""losing"" his love? She is playing with fire and IMO is bound to get burned.

OP, she is not ""helping"" him right now by continuing to enable him without boundaries. He NEEDS those boundaries to know how to deal with other people. Why does helping him come at the cost of hurting you? Isn't that her saying that she cares more about helping him than the feelings of the man that she supposedly wants to spend her life with? That's not ok. Once again, time for couples counseling to deal with this. She is putting Harold as a greater priority in her life than her relationship with you and that's a slippery slope to bad shit in your relationship."

731,"As a black woman, I fully understand. I have dated white guys in the past who have completely fetishised me. I never only dated a specific race and felt uncomfortable dating any guys who said they would ONLY date black girls. I didn't know if they actually liked me as a person or just that I fit the visual profile. Also, it's closed off not to even be open to other people. I found those guys ended up being close minded in other ways too. "
732,"I have no advice, but I finalized my divorce on Tuesday for the exact same reason. Down to the brush off “At least I’m not out at some bar.” I became incredibly lonely and decided that if I were going to be alone in my marriage, I might as well be alone single. The wound is fresh but I am 27 and hopeful I can still fall in love, get married, and have children with someone that like an hanging out with me. I’m sorry about your situation. I’ve been there and it sucks, I hope you can get through to him."

Ditch the lying BF, keep the dog. "
735,"&gt;His reasoning is that he doesn’t want to set the dynamic where I can just see his texts whenever I want

Sure that would be a fine reason except that this girl is trying to frame you. I think it's more than reasonable to want to see what she claims you're saying. 

I don't know if he just enjoys the attention or what, but if anyone tried to break up my relationship once, let alone twice, I would tell them where they can shove it and block them on every platform possible."

This is EXACTLY the same as an unsolicited dick pic from a friend. What on earth?!? I have seen some of my friends naked (changing, whatever), but if one of my buds sent me an ""explicit video,"" I would feel...gross about it.

741,"&gt;AT LEAST 8 months you realized he was a useless, absent dad. THREE months ago, you had a car accident.

Oh goodness, I didn't even catch that part. I thought that it was bad enough that he dumped everything on her after the accident, even though she was injured as well. My thought is that if he is not well enough to care for his own children, he needs to be in a mental or physical rehab. But, you are right. He is using OP 100%. The accident is nothing more than an excuse. She said she would leave if he got the dog. She is looking for any reason to stay, which will teach him more so that she is willing to sacrifice her happiness to him. Once you do that, it's done. Trust me, I know."

749,"When he says that there is ""nothing wrong"" with their dynamic, or he ""doesn't see"" a problem, he is directly dismissing your feelings and his relationship with you. He is telling you, to your face, that he is not willing to compromise time and effort with his mother in order to make time and effort for you. 

If you really, really want to give a wake up call one last shot, draw out a spreadsheet with the amount of time he spends with you and her. Ask him if that's what he thinks a married man's priorities should look like. Tell him this version of marriage isn't working for you, and it will end if things don't change. 

If he becomes defensive, pouty, accusatory, or angry, cut your losses and leave. 

If he agrees to individual amd couples counselling, nights without his mother, and to work on this with you as a team, there may be hope. Lierally anything less and it's unfixable."

Even if it seems innocent, people in commited relationships give their time and attention to their actual partners. He is watering someone elses plant by spending all of his time (and reltionship duties/activities) with her. She is on his mind constantly because...well he is with her constantly.

Listen, you arent an overbearing girlfriend by asking your SO to give more of a shit about you than another woman. You're also not the ""cool girlfriend"" by letting him hang out with her constantly. These are labels made up by people who want to do what they want without looking at their relationships enforcing healthy boundaries. He is moving in an opposite direction from you, I suggest you let him do it and make your stance known that you wont wait for him to cheat on you...if he hasnt already. "

752,"I stayed with a dropkick of a man for 6 years because I fell in love with his daughter.

I can't have children of my own, so it was really hard to leave what I felt was my only chance to be a mum - but in the end, I realised that I didn't want her to grow up thinking that the way her father treated me was acceptable. I didn't want her to seek unhealthy relationships when she got older because that's all she saw. 

Not saying that the OP should stay AT ALL - she should definitely get out. Nobody deserves to be used like that. But I can also understand why it's hard to leave the kids. "

She wants that kind of attention, and if it's over you, even better. That's why she wanted him to choose her (as if) by following her in his car. Your husband rubbing it in her face that he loves YOU and thinks she's silly (or invisible) would drive her crazy, I promise you. "

You aren't going to find support from people who haven't been through the same fear that the pain might be forever and have had to come to terms with the fact that even if you do recover completely, the experience changes you because you had to dig deep and learn in your vulnerability.

So while you don't have to identify with disability, you will find that disabled people understand in ways that abled people do not. That's why disabled and chronic pain support groups exist and 'I broke my ankle and it'll be all sorted in a few months' ones don't.

You will break your own heart and spirit looking for support from people who can't give it because they don't speak this language and have never even visited this country.

Think of it like this: if you were thinking of moving to Sweden, you'd go on a forum about Sweden or people who moved to Sweden right? You'd read guidebooks or blogs and talk to Swedish people instead of asking your partner repeatedly what he knows about Sweden. And you might end up not moving to Sweden. You might stay in the US. You might decide Denmark sounds better. But going on Tell Me About Sweden.com does not mean you have to take Swedish citizenship and never set foot in your native land again.

But if you ask a bunch of people who know nothing about the subject of Sweden, all you will hear are the same 'I love Swedish Fish' and muppet jokes and it will grind your gears and make you stuck. Painfree people will suggest green juices, yoga and positive thought which is the chronic pain equivalent and you will waste what energies you have on their bullshit not on adjusting to the version of yourself you need to be right now.

And even blunter, avoiding disabled people won't protect you from possibly becoming disabled. You can't 'catch' disability but you will discover some fantastic people with genuinely helpful tips physically and mentally who manage to incorporate disability in their lives and still do a wide range of things. It's not like God's waiting room (especially when you learn to filter some of the bullshit.)

You are grieving right now because this has changed how you feel about you and your body. You feel exposed, unloveable and vulnerable. It's the worst bit for many people even if they recover or reach remission and it's important you grieve in ways that help you regain control.

But most chronically ill or disabled start to thrive and adjust when they claim their new life rather than cling to the old one. My own chronic pain dropped from debilitating to manageable once I accepted I was bloody good at my disabled life instead of feeling like I was constantly failing at the abled world.

I would suggest that if you can, spend money on therapy right now. It will help more than any quack suggestions for the pain by helping you cope. Also stock up on heat pads and electric blankets.

My very best to you. This shit is *hard* and made worse by someone you love making you feel you are unloveable when you aren't. My very abled bodied exercise mad partner and I balance my bedbound life with his Tough Mudders and we both feel loved and seen but sometimes big life changes expose cracks in places you didn't expect."
764,"This. For all the talk about how he loves his kids, wanted to be more involved in their lives, etc, he hasn't actually DONE anything. If the mom is really emotionally abusive (which I'm not sold on - it could be another excuse from him as to why he didn't push harder for joint custody at the start) then he is to blame for leaving his kids in that situation. Honestly? It sounds like this guy's a loser with excuses for everything and the daughter is finally old enough to realize that."
765,"I don't think there is any way for you to convince your boyfriend to not be upset by this, and I think it would be wrong to try. Your friend just sounds bitter, tbh. Of course she's completely wrong. You can't just divide humans up into men and women and then say ALL men just want meaningless sex with lots of women and ALL women just want a relationship. That's a very shallow understanding of gender and sexuality, and it's a very hurtful stereotype too. It's also very ignorant and silly to assume that just because someone (or in her mind, ""all men"") finds a person attractive, that means they would have sex with that person given the chance. 

I think you should talk to your friend about the narrowness or her ideas about men and women and push back on them. "
766,"So she's the older sister but somehow it's your job to make her flight reservations. And it just gets worse from there. 


Ignoring her is best. It sucks that your parents take her side. Not surprising though. The path of least resistance (in the short term) is to give in to the crying child and tell off the responsible one."
767,"Perhaps not, but my relationship began a few weeks after Valentine's day and while I didn't buy them a big present, I got them a couple Rose's and a nice card. Even something small means something and gifts don't always have to be expensive. Even at this point if he had just written her a nice letter or even made her a gift that would show that he cares, and this to me shows that he does not."
768,I would not put up with this. The longer you do the worse it gets. You are still dating - not married. This is the best he will treat you. Consider that. 
769,Time cards from work and then cut out everyone involved including your parents. Seriously once your innocence is proven walk the hell away. 
770,"Girl he’s 22 not 12. He knows women wear makeup, and he knows you do too. Men can’t tell the difference between no makeup and a no-makeup look. They can definitely tell that your cat eye liner and fake lashes aren’t natural. 

I think you should work on your skin. R/skincareaddiction is a great place to start. You *can* have great skin. The issues you mentioned are treatable with drug store products and consistent habits. Give yourself three months of commitment to your skin and you’ll barely recognize yourself. 

Also, my secret weapon: lash extensions. I’ll never go back. I feel like I look like an IG model when o wake up. Proper skincare + lash extensions and these worries will be a thing of the past.

Btw: not sure what your skin is like, but if you’re oily, acne prone, and hyper-pigmented pm me. I’ll give you my whole routine. Skincare is *learned*, you don’t have bad skin, you don’t have ‘meh’ skin, you have *great* skin you don’t know how to care for it yet!

Good luck!"
771,"&gt;Now, I'm actually alone and I LOVE it. I'm happy even when I'm not happy, if that makes sense. I'm free.

Makes *so* much sense. I felt impossibly lonely in my marriage. I'm single now and loving it!"
772,"An 8 hour shift is a normal length one btw, as is a 40 hour week."
773,Don’t piss him off. You won’t like him when he’s angry...
774,"It wouldn't be unreasonable to begin the process of separating yourself from policies or opening up a bank account independently. Just because everything is in her or both of your names makes it harder, you still deserve not to have it loom over you as another thing she's holding over you. She can't rush you into moving on or forgiving her. She fucked up. She lied for months straight. I suspect of the tables were turned and you did this all to her she would have gone berserk. "
775,PerdidasBH- I completely agree. Children can take anything and turn it into them blaming themselves. It is really irresponsible to stay for the kids. Your child is going to think that he/she was the reason for your unhappiness. That's way above any child's pay grade. 
776,"So your wife cheated, paid zero consequences, you're paying all the consequences of her infidelity by trying to work through the healing process alone, and she's mad at you because you haven't healed from her betrayal fast enough.  

Nothing to say but leave her.  You don't have tolerate this.  I read all your responses about financial dependence, but also that your brother offered for you to live with him till you get out.  I suggest you take him up on that offer, file for divorce and get on your own feet.  There doesn't sound like there's anything redeeming about this relationship that would warrant saving it.  Get out while you're young and save yourself years if hurt."
777,"The only men I've ever met to refuse to give women oral were 100% selfish and terrible in bed. 

It would be a deal breaker for me. It is more common to meet men who actually give a fuck about your pleasure, that said that older generation of men are way less likely to care. Find a guy your age or maybe younger. Don't ever settle for a selfish partner. "
778,Honestly. The fact that he's been using it since November is why I won't be considering any counseling. He's hurt me way too many times. And he's become comfortable with that. 
779,"After the divorce my parents both isolated me and my brother from the outside world. Last time I remember having friends at the house was when I was 10 years old. I only got to go to a friends house once after that at 14. I stayed through college so I didn’t leave until I was 25. Looking back now it was clearly abuse but at the time I stayed because my mother was physically crippled and my father abandoned us later on. Only later did I realize mom was most likely mentally ill and he was too.

I was not allowed out without her, no internet, no friends, no relationships, no job allowed, no health care, no heat or a/c. I did not learn to drive until I was 26.  I was insulted regularly, talked down to, and told I was worthless and lazy.

If I hadn’t left when I did I’d still be in that house pushing 40 years old with no relationships or job prospects.  My partner had a similar upbringing as I. Mothers expected us to stay and take care of them until they died.

Both of us eventually escaped. I am in the tech field and have a simple life for myself now.  I’ve experienced more in the last few years than in the previous 25 as a prisoner. If I can do it, you can too.  You have to take the leap no matter how scary it is.

I would highly recommend getting the GED first then move out and go to a community college.  You’re gonna meet a lot of nice people but also people that will take advantage of you. Don’t try to compare yourself to others. They had completely different worlds. Also do not expect people to understand what you went through. Many will not truly understand and think you can mend the relationship with your parents or you are exaggerating. Forgive them for they do not know.

Remember everything you’ve survived. It’s what will keep you going in the dark days. You’re strong and can do this. Believe in yourself because sometimes others won’t.  Put yourself first for once and don’t take shit from anyone, not even “family”. I’ve learned that sometimes friends are more reliable than family.

Good luck to you."
780,"&gt;...but why does she feel so sure that Steve would say yes?

The easiest (and most likely) explanation is *not* that there is/may have been something between them.

The far more likely scenario lies entirely within Lola's mind. She wants Steve. She thinks she has X/Y/Z quality/ies that the OP does not, and *obviously* Steve would see that and want to choose Lola over OP. And, more importantly, the behavior in the past:

&gt;That was last night and I would have brushed it off but then add the comments like, “Yeah, Steve’s hot. I’d do him.” Always asking if her clothes are appropriate to wear in front of him... but then goes and wears the lowest cut top ever. When she came over and did mushrooms, she only wanted him to help her and when he was gone because he was sick of her hanging off him, kept asking where he was and when he was coming back. Then she’s sent me a nude and an explicit video of her and said, “Don’t show Steve!” Like, why the hell would I show him in the first place?!

Since OP and Steve have, presumably, not already shut this down hard, Lola here feels more emboldened with her behavior and increasingly-transparent attempts to get Steve alone so she can ""convince"" him she's the right one for him.

People's internal thought processes and delusions can be *incredibly* convoluted, and *incredibly* powerful... rationality be damned."
781,"I don't understand how you could trust someone who so easily and blatantly lied to your face, for so long. I'm not trying to convince you not to, just saying I literally would not be able to trust this person. "
782,"Yeah it's a repost/fake. From like a month ago, maybe a bit less.

Last time the post said the boss had been through IVF treatment with her ex husband, but it failed, and she didn't want anything from OP.

Lol. "
783,Was just about to say the sane thing - could very well be a cheapskate but then buying the gift for a friend out of nowhere is telling..either he isn't into you that much or he values the friend more...either way you deserve someone better..good luck!
784,"In my extended family we have had 3 kidney transplants (bad genes) in which a sibling was a living donor.  

My mom had her kidney transplant in the early 1970s and survived 35 years with 1 early episode of rejection treated with steroids. She lived until she was 75.  I don’t know how long she would have lived if she hadn’t been a smoker for most of her life. Her donor was her brother who was 10 years older than her and he died the same year she died at age 85.  He never had any complications from being a donor. 

My  2 cousins who donated to their siblings have lived full lives, working, traveling and doing whatever they want without any limitations.  The transplants  have made significant impacts in their siblings lives. The last transplant was 6 years ago.  

They say when you get a transplant you trade one disease for another.  The medications to suppress your immune system are potent and can cause other issues.  There is no way to predict what his long term prognosis will be. 

Being up close and personal to transplants my whole life it’s normal in our family to talk about donating (even as kids we would joke around to get someone to let you borrow or do something or I won’t give you my kidney).  The truth is there are no guarantees, you might not be a match, and even if you are a match you may not pass the physical exams for some reason .  

Do what feels right to you.  It’s your body, and your life.  Your mom will worry either way."
785,"Sorry, but nope. That's passive aggressive and passive aggressive doesn't work with 80% of guys out there. 


Guys (stereotyping here) tend to be pretty myopic when it comes to a long term crush suddenly being ""available"". These kinds of comments could be easily misconstrued by the dude in question and taken to mean that OP is expressing a level of trust in the guy by sharing these other stories that indicates they share a more ""intimate"" relationship. This perceived emotionally ""intimacy"" could then be taken as an indication of OPs interest in the guy, and badda-boom badda-bing in about 5 seconds of horny, make,  20-something internal dialog he's convinced he's on a different tier and you're just talking about ""those guys"" one of which he is clearly not.


Not trying to say this line of thought is at all rational, but it's a hell of a lot more common than you might realize. You can't leave that window to sexual intimacy open even a tiny hair if you're not interested. As a higher up response said, just be direct and blunt. 

Something along the lines of ""I think you're really cool and I value our friendship, but I don't have any interest in you that way. You're just not my type."" would work much better than the comment above me, IMO.

788,You have a shitty boyfriend.
789,"Is she ever in there unsupervised?  This could be a stretch, but a friend of mine had a huge opiate addiction and NONE OF US KNEW.  She told me part of how she got so many pills was gaining access to her friend's bedrooms and bathrooms and looking through their cabinets/drawers.  She said the hardest part was coming up with an excuse to gain unsupervised access to those areas, but she could always think of something.  "
