0,"Don't buy his bullshit. He was cheating and refused to own up to it. You should absolutely go to the clinic. Jesus Christ, ""I'll tell you tomorrow"" is not an appropriate answer to a question like that. What an ass. Be glad he's out of your life."

2,"For me, 3 strikes I’m out. Clearly they’re not interested enough to make the effort of even a causal or low maintenance date. 

I think you should back up a bit and maybe start seeing other people. If she wants to see you, you can let her contact you and arrange the next date. 

Edit: I don’t see this as mind games. I’m just not going to waste time and energy on a person who doesn’t seem to care all that much. "
3,"My brother is in a wheelchair and not one of my wedding photos was ruined because he was in it. In fact I show off the pictures with pride.  There is no way you’ll ruin any aspect of this wedding to anyone other than the fiancé, and she sounds like she sucks anyway.  You seem very kind and considerate but this is a special day for your brother that you will both remember and you should be there as his best man. "
4,"LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES MAN

Whatever you do you have make sure you leave her with absolutely no hope of having a relationship with you. Which sounds harsh, but that's what a break up is. 

I say this because with a girl like that there this is a **huge** temptation to want to let her down easy, and be nice, and not make her feel terrible. FORGET THIS. Your job is to be clear, and direct, but coming from a source of compassion, and not resentment or anger. Because if you let her have hope when deep down you know she shouldn't, it will be shitty for you but a thousand times shittier for her and that's a cruel thing to do.

SECOND THING

When she's crying to you saying how devastated she is, how she doesn't know what she did wrong, how lonely she is, etc. You can't be the one to console her. It will be such a huge temptation to be the one that is there for her because you see her just broken. YOU CANNOT BE THE GUY. She needs to fill that hole with friends and family.

Alright man, go make that hurricane happen and weather the storm and you guys will both be better off and happy in the end. Just brace for impact."
5,My thoughts are that you definitely should NOT allow the 32 year-old guy you've only been dating for 4 months move in for acost of $400 a month.
6,"This sort of thing comes up a lot on r/loseit. Unfortunately people often don’t want to admit there’s a problem with their own weight, so they say you are being unhealthy instead."
7,"Dude. She made your graduation ceremony about her. She threw a tantrum at YOUR event. Grown-ups don't do that to people they love, or to anyone really. They don't act out like that in public. This is ALL on her.

I'm guessing this isn't the first time she's gotten irrationally upset about small mistakes?"
8,Find a new place before you're turned into a lampshade
9,"I give him two weeks before he starts texting you again, trying to get your attention and sympathy.

You should block him before then."
10,Awesome!!! I thought this was going to be about how you landed a guy in his 60's. This was a much better read.
11,"Wow your parents sound like real pieces of work.

They care more about the possibility of having this girl push out grandbabies then their own daughters feelings. 

You did nothing wrong. In fact the only wrong ones I see here are your parents.
If you haven't thanked your brother for having your back, make sure you do."
12,"My first thought was, ""what in hell is 'severe relationship anxiety'? Like, anxiety? 

He went through your trash and laundry. This is creepy. He read your journal. Oh, HELL no. You cannot ""help"" him through violating your privacy. I'm so sorry he did this to you. "
13,"I once had a similar clingy (crushing on me) neighbor/building manager who really took advantage of the fact that he was in my apartment for a few days working on a leak. 

He once chased my car a BLOCK down the street when I left the building without engaging him. 

Imagine HOW blunt you have to be to get through to a person who CHASES A CAR. Once I stopped being nice, and got blunt, he did the whole ""I was just being a nice guy"" thing. 

Before you move, try this: Don't avoid her. Every time you see her say ""Sorry, I can't talk right now"" and NOTHING else. Then say nothing to her the rest of the time she follows you. Give it a week or two. Will it awful? Yes. But try it, and she will probably get hurt and stop, or latch on to someone easier. 

This isn't awkward, this isn't extroverted, this is clinical mental illness."
14,"OK, this is a really strange scenario. I know the first instinct is to think Nate is in on some sort of plan with Greg, but based on the timeline of events, I'm more inclined to think that Nate has unwittingly become friends with Greg and Greg is trying to manipulate him as well. You and Nate have been together 4 months, Greg's been in town for a week, Nate and Greg also just became Facebook friends this week...what is the likelihood that Greg just appeared in Nate's life and said ""hey, that FWB of yours is my dream woman; keep sleeping with her, but I want you to help me stalk her so she eventually ends up with me"" and Nate actually agreed to it? Not likely. Greg is obsessive and Nate might be in danger too.


The message ""I think it's working, anything else you can think of?"" could be about a million different things - Greg might be asking him for advice on how to get a girl to like him (not realizing it's *you*), or workout tips or how to get rid of toenail fungus or whatever. It's entirely possible that Greg has been stalking you, but that wasn't enough for him and is now trying to ingratiate himself into your friend group in order to get closer to you and to be able to track you more efficiently.


I would actually ask Nate to meet me somewhere very public and ask him about Greg directly, or, if you don't feel comfortable with that, just explain that you have a stalker and that's it's gotten serious enough to the point where you will be going to the police. If he's in on it, you will probably be able to tell from his body language if he's guilty, but I would bet money he doesn't actually know Greg other than he is just seemingly a really friendly, cool dude he recently made friends with.


Also, not to freak you out, but you need to lock down your social media presence and give your apartment, vehicle and electronics a security check:

1) Turn off all location finding on your phone and all apps


2) Block this guy on all platforms and remove any ""friends"" who you don't actually know (although wait to do this until after you've filed a police report - the more he sends, the more seriously the police will take it)


3) Send out a private message to all of your family members and friends to make sure they don't talk to this guy, add him on social media, or give him *any* information regarding you.


4) Check your computer for keyloggers/spyware


5) If you have a vehicle, take a mirror and flashlight and check the entire underside of the vehicle for a GPS tracking device (you can also take your vehicle in for an oil change or tire rotation and tell the mechanic you would like to take a look while it's up on the lift - if you tell them what's going on, they will most likely help you look)


6) Make sure all the windows in your apartment lock and you can go get a wood dowel cut to fit to sit between the sliding pane and the frame so the window cannot slide open


7) You can ask management to change the locks to your apartment if you are at all worried he's gained access to your apartment. Sadly, it's super easy to steal keys from an unattended apartment rental office - especially for a determined stalker


8) He is most likely parked outside your apartment and is monitoring things from there. It's possible he knew Nate had left your apartment because he watched him leave and he waited around to see that you were staying in for the night.


9) Change your routine - the times you leave/come home, the route you take to work, the places you go for breakfast/lunch/dinner/coffee. 


10) Be aware of your surroundings and carefully watch for *anyone* following you. I had an ex hire a private detective to follow me for two weeks - when I finally caught on, I marched right up to his car and the guy literally scrambled to roll up his window and peeled out of my office parking lot, never to be seen again.


11) Make sure there is no way he can see into your apartment. Remember that partially closed blinds or semi-sheer drapes coupled with your interior lights on means anyone can see *everything* from the outside.


Because the thing is, someone who has just arrived in an unknown city for the week suddenly bumps into you SIX TIMES...well, that is obviously no coincidence at all, he has a way that he's tracking you. Please take stalking seriously! Source: I was stalked for a year by an abusive ex who was determined to make me ""his"" again. 


You might even want to send a few messages out to his family, especially if you suspect he just up and left his life and they're worried about him. Ask them what vehicle he's driving and what the license plate number is. Then take that information to the police and file a report. Save all the messages he sent you, bring those to the police as well.


You aren't crazy, this guy is inserting himself into your life - you need to take action now."
15,"Your experience sounds like something similar to what my wife has gone through recently.  She worked to support herself for many years, but when she and I got married, it turned out that the money I was bringing in was able to cover our respective expenses comfortably, so she did not *have* to work if she did not want to.  She decided to stop working at a job and instead focus on other things; that was nearly 15 years ago. 

Recently, for reasons that are unimportant to the conversation, we have had some unexpected expenses come into our lives, and my paycheck was no longer enough to cover everything.  So she went out looking, and found a job a couple of months ago.  And she hates it.  Just as you hate yours.  She has the same dread each evening, thinking about the fact that she has to go to work tomorrow.  She has the same frustration that there's no time (it seems) to do anything *but* work any more.

I don't believe that in her case it's anxiety or depression; I believe it's simply the stress that comes from adjusting from a lifestyle that one has lived for many years into a new one that is substantially different.

I can't say for certain that it will get better, though it has, somewhat, for my wife; you and she are different people.  But once she got into the groove of going to bed earlier, and getting up earlier, and going to the office and doing whatever it is that she does, it at least became *regular*, instead of seeming like an intrusion every day on what her normal routine was.  That may happen for you as well.

I don't know whether that will help you or not, but I wanted to post it so that you would know that at least you are not the only one who is having a similar experience.

In my wife's case, it helps her to focus, not on the job itself, but on the end goal that the job is helping her and us to work *toward*; carrying a heavy sack of concrete really sucks, and if you are focused on nothing but the weight of the concrete all day, it's nothing but drudgery.  If instead, however, you focus on the temple you are building *with* that concrete, and how beautiful it is going to be when you are done, the weight (though not less) can be more fulfilling.

Do not think of each day as ""I have to go to work""; try to think of it as ""I am helping my husband and myself have a more secure financial future""."
16,"Shit dude I'm sorry. Only thing you can do is cut them out asap, as much as it hurts to. "
17,"You didn't do anything wrong, but you're not going to ""win"" this. "
18,"I don't think I fully understand the part where he feels like it would only be worth it if you secured a position with a salary more than his. Of course, moving can be costly, but having $50k more per year in your collective pocket still sounds like a HUGE win to me. Especially if he can move and still make what he's making right now, though I don't know what that would look like for him. Am I missing something?"
19,"He won't fully understand until you tell him the dirty truth.  If you are uncomfortable telling him the true details of your childhood, then simply tell him that you aren't comfortable discussing your family life and you would appreciate it if he doesn't bring up that part of your life."
20,"Your son already knows his mom doesn't accept him, I'm sure her expressions scream it to him. I think you should support your son and go to his wedding without her. He's never going to have a healthy relationship with her because she won't ever let it happen, you however can have a healthy relationship with him and his husband. Please do, one supportive parent can be life changing. 

"
21,"You go to the wedding, you apologize to your son for letting her bullshit slide all these years, and you forge a completely separate relationship with your son and son in law, without forcing them into contact with your wife.

You have choices, and anything less will destroy your relationship with your son."
22,"While a very thoughtful gift, the level of professionalism is how I would judge this situation. Is your friend a professional photographer, an amateur photographer, or just a guy with a camera? Were the pictures taken in a studio, a neutral location, or at his apartment? Aside from that, a quick conversation with either of them could help clear things up. Best of luck."
23,"Yeah, you don't have to visit them so much, that's ridiculous.

""Go ahead and visit them, and if you'd like me to join you for lunch/dinner, just give me a call 20min ahead of time, and I'll head over there. Meanwhile, I'll be mowing the lawn/going to the gym/sorting my stamp collection."""
24,"He read a notebook you use for therapy and bad asked him not to read? That is a very serious breach of trust, anxiety or no.  He needs therapy, and I would recommend you getting out of the relationship. If you stay with him, you will likely get stuck, and you deserve better."
25,"This is not about extrovert/introvert. This woman is mentally unstable. You need to be absolutely clear with her, and give no ground. Not an inch. Be curt. Be rude. Her emotions are not your problem."
26,"10/10 I would take it. Sounds like staying where you are is going to pigeonhole you in your career, which could lead to resentment and anger."
27,"I don't see much other option than being super firm. That means not letting her steamroll you.

Drop ALL the terminology that suggests you're ""unable"" to chat/hang out with her. Do not let it sound like its something you ""can't do"" because of ""reasons"". The point here is that you don't WANT to chat.

So be straight-forward. ""Sorry Friendly, I don't want to chat right now.""   ""Friendly, I want to be left alone now.""   ""Friendly, i do not want to exchange pleasantries every day, please stop coming to greet me when I get home.""

If she persists, again, you dont let her steamroll you, you don't let her blabber at you while you politely try to go about your business, you dont pretend you ""can't"" chat with her. ""Friendly I just told you that I do not want to chat. You need to leave me alone now.""

And if she cries, you let her. You can say ""sorry for upsetting you"", but that's about it and you should only give it once. Do NOT let social niceties draw you into telling her ""oh it's not really that bad"" or ""there's nothing wrong with you"". There IS something wrong with her behavior. You can be kind, but other than a quick expression of concern for her being upset, she should be met with: ""You feel like a burden? Well, yes, it is a burden to have to socialize every time our door opens"" ""Do we hate you? We do certainly hate when we aren't given the space we need""  ""You say you'll never bother us again? Thats a bit extreme but yes you're right, you need to stop."" Try not to focus on how emotional she is about it or how sad it makes her - focus on the actions needed from HER to stop this relationship from going rotten. The ball should be in her court.

Don't spend $1000 though. As an introvert I know it will be hard but TRUST ME, follow through with it just once and it will be INFINITELY easier the next time. Losing the fear of being blunt is so freeing after that first time."
28,"&gt; my stepfather had sexually abused me as a child

Oh, zero. Absolutely zero. The same amount he would have left to you, your brother, and your mother combined. This is also what your mother wanted when she died.

Your sister, like your mother, has choices. Hopefully she can make the brave choice to cut him out when your mother could not.

Also, he has her whole damn 401k."
29,"Talk. To. Your. Brother. 

I’m so sorry for what she said. But you deserve every happiness. Just like any person does. "
30,Please check the carbon monoxide detector in your home and possibly the exhaust system in your car. I am not kidding. 
31,"Reduce your contact with your inlaws.

They can drive 8 hours to see the little one. In my wife's family and mine, it was always the adults that came to see the children not vice versa, it is stupid and a little cruel to stress a young one out due to inter-city travel.  

So if they want to see their grand-daughter or niece, tell them they are welcome to visit. 
"
32,"I'm so sorry she broke your trust that way. That sucks and I wish you a happy, healthy pregnancy. And I'm sorry about your mother, I hope she's responding to treatment. 

I'm with your husband, walk. She's been a terrible friend to you. Do what's best for your mental and physical health, walk and don't feel any guilt over it. "
33,"Your brother's fiance is a POS. :)

Besides that, you 100% should show up, be in the wedding and have a wonderful day with your best friend, supporting him. 

If it were my best friend (my lovely sister) no matter what, I'd want her there and nobody could tell me otherwise. I promise your brother likely feels the same. 
"
34,"You’re correct that this secret is not yours to share with your boyfriend &amp; that you shouldn’t betray your friend’s trust here. 

However, you need to figure out how to process this news. Because from your boyfriend’s point of view, you &amp; your friend had a heart-to-heart, you came home so upset &amp; tired that you couldn’t go in to work the next day, &amp; you’ve remained so upset that you’re still struggling days later. You can’t tell him what’s going on, so he can’t do anything to help you process the situation, &amp; you’re not succeeding in processing it yourself. So he’s kind of right that you’re bottling up, in that you’re internalizing this news of what happened to your friend &amp; not working through it at all. 

I’m not trying to diminish the gravity of what your friend told you or how you felt when she did. But she probably didn’t imagine that you would react this way &amp; carry this as a burden. "
35,then they both need to go and get a place together.
36,"This isn't about his view on monogamy, it is about the fact that he enters into monogamous relationships, lets the woman believe he is monogamous and then cheats.  If he TRULY didn't believe in monogamy, then he should openly state that to women he dates and look for a polyamorous relationship.

No, you shouldn't look beyond it.  I wouldn't confront him about it anyone either.  I would simply stop being friends with a cheating scumbag, because that reflects poorly on you."
37,My current GF asked me out with a note but I thought a 1 was a 7 and texted the wrong number. I went back and checked the note later thank goodness and realized my mistake and texted the right one instead. I wonder if this could have happened to you.
38,"First, at 21 there is absolutely no reason you should be helping someone who is almost 40 pay down their debt. No way. You should be planning for your future. This isn’t “he got cancer and is drowning in medical debt”, this is “I spent more money on stuff than I should have.” I would not combine finances until the credit card debt is gone and he has a better handle on things. 

Second, I wouldn’t lump house debt into the same pile as credit card debt     ."
39,"She's probably afraid that, if you and Alex break up/stop seeing each other, her relationship with Alex's mom will be strained. Because even though you were raised like sibs, you're not *actually* sibs."
40,"So you were 22 and he was 34 when you first got together, and he’s since isolated you from any friends or family who could advise you. He doesn’t want you venting your frustrations for outside perspectives (whether family or internet strangers) because he *knows* he’s in the wrong, and he wants to continue having power over you. When you have no one to whom you can turn, he is free to control/manipulate you. This is a textbook abuser tactic. You’re not the bad guy. This relationship is toxic, and you need to leave. You deserve better, and it sounds like, at the very least, you have a supportive mom who would likely be more than happy to help you figure things out. "
41,"&gt;&gt;Mainly he said that while on the bathroom he saw a toilet paper on the trash with what seemed like cum and from there he start looking and found in my laundry basket a underwear he said had a cum stain on the back. From this, he accused me of cheating and having unprotected sex.

Dump. I was involved with a person who made these exact charges against me, and it was so baffling...and it only got worse."
42,"Your first problem was comforting her after you said something last time.   Tell her again and also say, yes, it has become somewhat of a burden on us. She obviously has a problem, but it’s not yours to solve. "
43,"I'm really glad you found time to go to the doctor and work on your mental health! And I'm glad you put in your notice at that job...they were overworking you to the extreme, which probably exacerbated your mental state and made everything so much worse. 

You've taken some great steps. Keep it up!"
44,"If you haven’t already responded to all of those congratulatory texts / messages, I would just ignore them for now. You have enough going though your mind right now. You don’t need the added pressure of fielding all of those messages. 

Also, instead of telling people it was a miscarriage (which may land you in some uncomfortable conversations with any friends or family members who have also had miscarriages &amp; want to emotionally support you through yours), I would tell people that it was a false alarm entirely. You took some home pregnancy tests, misread the results because you were nervous about your missed period, told your boyfriend you thought you were pregnant, the moron announced it to everyone he’s ever met, then you went to the gyno &amp; found out you weren’t even actually pregnant. He still gets to look like an idiot but you’re not walking into the emotional minefield of announcing a pretend miscarriage. Then still dump him. "
45,"&gt;I get the idea that he would leave his wife, but my friend would break up with him if he did that because she hates the idea of people divorcing.

Your friend has some fucked up values. "
46,This is easily the funniest comment I read today.
47,"To me, I'd just explain that I wasn't comfortable with it. The fact that she was so honest about it really makes me believe that she acted in good faith. "
48,[deleted]
49,"Jack knows exactly what he is doing. Once you know twins well, they don’t even look anything alike, and even if that isn’t the case for him, he knew her bedroom. He is GROSS. "
50,"She was looking at your wedding through the lens of her own bitterness toward relationships. She’s upset that her love life is going poorly, and she wants to make you feel as bad as she does.

Don’t let her succeed. Don’t give her comments any weight, you know they’re bullshit anyways. Stop taking her calls, and if anyone (including your sister) asks why, tell them that she treated you badly and you’re waiting for an apology. 

Edit: Adding to this, even if she apologizes, I think you have every right to keep your contact with her to a minimum. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life."
51,What a strange accusation to make. How does needing to go take medicine mean you are talking to someone else instead of him?
52,"Just an FYI for reference I did boudoir as a wedding gift to my husband. I went to a mid range photographer and the whole process was almost $500. It was not cheap. 

I can see how she would easily be able to justify it in her head because this guy is free and she would still get good pics. It’s possible because of your friends set up from her end she’s treating it professionally and assuming he will look at her as an artist does. Naive as that may be. 

"
53,"I don't know what you can ""fix."" The parts I find most disturbing regarding this story is that it seems like your in-laws and friends don't know what you were accused of but chose to cut you out anyway and that no one had the courage/integrity to apologize for how they treated you.

I would trust your wife's words. From my end, if I were your wife, I would be really bothered that my family didn't even ask what happened (at least that what it sounds like). If you were really believed to be a monster, why wouldn't they have been there for your wife and checking up on her?"
54,"I don't think you're missing anything. It sounds like OP's husband likes the status quo and doesn't want to move, so he's creating rules to keep it from happening."
55,"Your husband is still grieving, and this isn't the best time to be making decisions that will have long term repercussions.

Can you ask him if he'd be willing to wait a bit?  Maybe 6 months or so?  In that time, he'll either decide against it and maybe do something else, or he'll strengthen his resolve and be more sure that the design is what he wants."
56,"How awful. I just wanted to add don’t be ashamed to tell mutual friends what happened between your ex gf and your former friend. If you don’t chances are they’ll make something up to make you look bad or make it look like what they did was ok. 

I like calling people out on something if they’ve screwed me over. But I wait until I’m calm and rational. Other people might tell you differently. But it makes me feel better personally. "
57,"Ummm.
They are your children and should be treated equally across the board. Regardless  of majors.

I'm with your son. There's no way I would have contact or a relationship with someone who displayed clear favoritism to my sibling. 

The reasoning is just so absurd as well. 

And agree with other poster- why is this a decision your husband solely makes. Do you not have access to bank accounts? If my daughter was receiving money monthly- I'd be transfering the same amount to my sons bank account regardless of my husbands ""opinion""
I would never  allow anyone to mistreat one child. 

This is creating division not only between son and father, but potentially  between siblings as well. Terrible. "
58,"I agree with the person above saying to just drop it in casual conversation “It’s good to see you back, we thought you guys weren’t together anymore” it removes some of the connotation that your getting involved or overly nosey. If she’s dumb enough to cheat there she should face the consequences of her actions and the guy shouldn’t have to keep walking around like a fool. Please do the right thing and stop worrying how you do it (and how it affects HER so much) and just do it regardless. If you have to march over there and just straight up, “look this may be none of our business, but she was openly and loudly unfaithful to you while you were away, we like you so we just felt you should know.”"
59,"My brother too. I’m disgusted by OP’s future sister in law, and I reckon if he backs out of being best man, it should only be because that marriage sounds like a bad idea."
60,"The way you described it, I think he just thinks that you REALLY like the pictures and that basically is doing you a favor by showing you pictures of his baby everyday. I honestly wouldn't know how to react either if someone constantly came to me with pictures of their baby... 

But, maybe... Instead of being confrontational and laying it on plain sight, just try to lessen the ""excitement"" as soon as you see the pictures. As time progresses, he'll get the hint from your reaction and PROBABLY stop. Probably...

But good luck to you haha!"
61,"Driving is dangerous, and you do have to constantly focus on it when you're doing it. He's not wrong about that aspect. 

But driving itself isn't actually hard once you do it a few times. And it's easy enough to train a competent and safe driver if he really wanted to. His ""protection"" here is putting you at a real disadvantage in life."
62,She literally said she didn't want to be in a relationship with him. She had her chance and wasted it.
63,He's just being too sensitive about getting dumped ;)
64,"Burn them to the ground in front of the group of friends.
 
It's petty and other people will advise you to take the high road. I'm not knocking that approach. But after you break up with her, she's just going to start openly dating the other guy. They may play it cool for a bit so they don't look sketchy, but the end result is that you have lost everything (including the friend group since you won't want to see the two of them ever again) and the shitty people still go along happily.
 
So I say that you publicly burn down their worlds, make them outcasts, and make it hurt. At least that way you get to keep the friends. 

"
65,"I cant say I particularly agree with a lot of these comments. You can go into -some- more detail if you wish, but you've only been together a month. You're not obligated to in the slightest. And its not affecting your relationship.

Try framing it differently to him-- ""it hurts my feelings when you imply you think I should be close to my mother without understanding why I cant be close to her"". Or, if applicable, set a boundary. ""It makes me uncomfortable when you bring up my family in that way, please dont."" You can be open and honest without spilling everything!

I dont think its unreasonable to let him know that its not helpful when he tries to give advice or perspectives from something he may not even fundamentally understand, or have the details to. He can be helpful by listening when/if you decide to open up and by respecting your boundaries gor now. Tell him you are not ready to share those details, but you would like him to respect your stance that not speaking with your mother is what is safest and healthiest for you."
66,"Right, so I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail over how it was handled on her end, but i'll give some general advice over what would be a few good, next steps:

Firstly, even if you're not thinking about getting involved with her again, I would ask her that she makes a conscious and public effort equivalent to the meltdown, in making it right with your friends and family.

You can frame it as the only chance of you guys having a relationship in the future, but it at least gets your name out of the mud and will smooth over some of your other relationships.

Secondly, if you are considering at all getting back together with her, remember what has happened here. In the event of a perceived or legitimate fuck-up on your behalf, this is the very real retaliation that you will face.

She's a bridge-burner and has shown that she is *extremely* good at it. That would give me some serious pause for concern.

Personally, even in really messy break-up scenarios, i'm the kind of person that would give a basic 'it didn't work out' excuse, because I don't really want to burden people with my own personal problems. In my 30's I know quite a few devorcees, and it's honestly painful when they start getting on their shitty marriage soapboxes when it's been months/years since it happened. I really wouldn't want to be involved in the type of personality that does this.

"
67,"I am more than a little surprised that your 26 year old girlfriend has the same style/coloring/size as your 61 year old mom? Is she planning on wearing them??

have you looked at her clothes to see if your mom's stuff is there??"
68,"Spending every weekend with in-laws? Give me the sweet release of death first, seriously. 

Even if you like your in-laws, every weekend is SO MUCH. And they live 10 minutes away! Why does she need you there?"
69,"&gt; My thoughts are that you definitely should NOT allow the ~~32 year-old~~ guy you've only been dating for 4 months move in ~~for acost of $400 a month.~~ 

""No. It's too early for that step. No."""
70,"He is clearly not over her on any level, and her feelings are his number one priority. He's got some nerve trying to make you the bad guy. I'd be done with him after this. "
71,"When he does things like that now, when you two are not even dating yet, what do you think will he do when you are in a relationship?

He does not respect your privacy and he won’t in the future. I guess it’s better for you to just being friends."
72,"It doesn't sound like she was being malicious, so a simple heads-up to her parents should be fine.  Something like "" Hey parent, just wanted to let you know that kiddo surprised me by jumped up on my arm earlier and we both fell down because of it.  Wanted to tell you before she accidentally does it to someone more fragile"".  Or something along those lines.

74,"This. Breaking up with you was just another cry for attention. He probably only broke up with you because he hopes you're going to run back to him crying and begging him to let you worry about him. Then, as soon as you start to feel comfortable in the relationship again, he'll suddenly want to take a break.

This isn't even high school drama. This is junior high school level shit. Your ex-boyfriend is basically two 12 year old girls in a trench coat."
75,"This is a mental health crisis. Tell him he's going to see a psychiatrist or the marriage is over. You have to essentially force him into treatment here because he's developing severe mental illness.

&gt;How do I support him while not going crazy?

You force him to get care. Either by Baker Acting him or ultimatums. Anything else you do at this point is enabling his psychosis.

76,You thanked your loved ones.  Doesn’t she think that includes her?
77,It isn't normal. It's infantile and controlling and you deserve SO much better. You're about to enter a whole new phase of life--is this really the person you want along for the ride?
78,"You have more important things in your life right now than a selfish bridezilla who betrayed your trust. 
Walk away so you and your husband can focus on your pregnancy and time with your mother.
"
79,"Two separate things need to happen:

- Talk to your wife about how you feel. Don't make it about how she acts, how she feels, what she thinks about any of this. What's important is she knows that a) you feel this way and b) you do not *want* to feel this way. Maybe she can come up with ways to help you stop feeling so bad; reassurances, cutting back time around the dude, etc. Give her a chance to be the wife she's been over the last 8 years before letting jealousy get the better of you. 

- Get your shit together. You're not happy with yourself right now and that's what makes this particular situation so scary and painful. Buy a new wardrobe, hit the gym, maybe consider a therapist if you think it will help. But just as your wife has hot yoga as ""her thing"" and clearly invests in herself, *you* need to be investing in *yourself* with a ""thing"" that validates you. If you felt better about yourself, then maybe you'd feel more secure in the face of her obvious crush. 

Remember, you can't control what she does. Only what you do."
80,I just wanted to say good on you for getting at a healthy weight at such a young age. You just saved yourself from a lifetime of disease and health problems. Your mom is just insecure. Just keep repeating that it was a healthy weight loss anytime she tries to say you starved yourself. Congrats on the progress!

And then...

&gt; I just don’t have anyone to talk to right now.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's absolutely the right time to talk to your parents. It sounds like your parents will love you through this and help you make the right decision. "
84,"Nope. He’s a creep, and I agree with everyone else who’s saying he has a twin fetish. The bed thing is just not acceptable, to the point you had to wake your sister up to get him to leave you alone? No ma’am. 

This isn’t about him mixing you up constantly. He’s assaulting you and getting away with it, cause oh oops haha! You look like Alice! Puke. 

Your sister needs to drop his ass yesterday.  "
85,"Think about things that happen in your life as lessons and challenges presented to you for your own growth. 

WAKE UP, OP. THIS IS A TEST. 

If you move and pay $1000 then you are FAILING THE TEST. 

You do not need to be rude, as some people are suggesting. What you do need to do is get the message across and be FIRM in your words.   
""I'm going to have to stop you right there. I do not want to be rude, but you need to understand that I do not want to to engage in conversation every time I come to or leave my apartment. This is not because I think you are a terrible person, it is because it is unreasonable. Sometimes I am going somewhere and I just want to leave. Sometimes I am coming home and I just want to get inside and relax. I honestly have no problem talking to you idly on occasion, but this is happening every time we are coming or going and I know it is not a coincidence. I am not saying I will ignore you if we happen to cross paths in the halls, but you need to see that what you are doing is a bit unreasonable. Do you understand?""

She will be upset to some degree, but that is her lesson. You both need to learn a lesson here and grow from this experience. Do not diminish the lesson by back peddling like you did before. When she says she knows she is a burden or something to guilt trip you then you can say something like:  
""Those are your words, not mine. I'll see you around, ok?"" and leave.

If this continues the next time then you can say ""I'm sorry, we don't have time to talk right now."" (you have to give the benefit of the doubt that she just happened to be out at the same time, unlikely as it is). If it continues after that then you have to reiterate the whole thing, but don't give her an inch. 

""Listen, I've already talked to you about this. I don't want to be unfriendly, but I've told you we are not social people. I know that can be hard to understand because you're a social person, but we're not. We would mostly like to be left alone, if you can believe it!""

Deliver it all with a genuine smile, but be FIRM. 

If it continues beyond that then you have a bigger issue on your hands.

86,"&gt; while she tells me she's still attracted to me, I just don't see how it's possible any more 

That sentence taints the rest of this entire post, because it sounds like your insecurities are getting the better of you. Plenty of people can be buoyed up by others without being turned on, or having a crush. You're right that saying something wouldn't help, it would come off as accusatory. But if you think you're not perking her up any more...try harder!

87,"My mother used to have friends and activities but every time she did something, my dad would complain about her choice of friends or her choice of activities. Eventually, she decided that she wasn’t going to do anything in order to keep the peace. Bear in mind that he has friends and hobbies.

She’s now 61 and soooo resentful of my dad as well as lonely because she spent a lifetime working and raising children, essentially living for everyone but herself. Is that what you want for yourself? It’s a slippery slope.

Your husband is being hugely inconsiderate. It sounds like he doesn’t pull his weight at home and seems to see you as nothing more than a wife and mother. 

If you relent on salsa and bachata (also lol @ grinding), he’ll see that he can control your life. You tried to include him and he wasn’t interested so why does this mean you can’t still enjoy yourself?

You guys need counseling. This is a bigger issue than just dancing. Additionally, I’d be a little suspicious of him. Why is he so concerned about you meeting someone? Maybe he met someone during one of his many activities."
88,"OK, so he's not ready to talk. That's valid, and you are AWESOME for understanding that. What you NEED to talk about is what exactly triggers him and how you can help him feel safe. Does he need you to ask? To warn him (Incoming girlfriend alert! You're gonna be snuggled if you don't say to back off, baby!)? To agree to 'free touch' times and 'ask first' times?  Are there certain kinds of approach or touch that trigger him? 

Make it clear you aren't asking him to talk about WHY until and unless he's ready, but you want to talk about HOW to help. Sounds very PTSD, and maybe there's reading or resources that could help you both, too."

91,"This:

&gt; We have always gotten along well and been great together. 

is directly contradicted by this:

&gt; he never considers my feelings when making a decisions

The reason why you've always ""gotten along well"" is because you always do what he wants, you don't rock the boat and demand more. You're not great *together* because you are not a team. Team means together, not ""I just go along with what my husband says because he's always right and I get nothing out of this and I have zero say in my own life.""

He is being ridiculous; if he had been against the thing all along, then *maybe* he would have had a leg to stand on, but he agreed with the plans at every single step of the way, up to and including your offer to still pay your part so that it did not devolve on your family.

He doesn't get to agree to something and then be mad at you because you did it."
96,"Your mother is likely ashamed you achieved at 17 what she’s spent her whole life telling herself is impossible- you lost the weight. Clear the matter up with anyone who approaches you out of concern, and tell her that you will not discuss your weight loss with her in any capacity for any reason, and that if you hear even once more that she told someone you’re anorexic there will be severe and lasting consequences for your relationship with her. 

She’s behaving badly and this is probably the tip of the iceberg as far as her bad behavior is concerned. Even if you were anorexic, running her mouth about that to strangers would still be deeply inappropriate and abusive of her. She’s not a mentally healthy woman, don’t expect her to act like one. Just demand she play by your rules if she wants to spend any time with you. "
97,"Block him. Block him. Block him. I've had the boyfriend who chose to fake a serious illness before. He also used it as an excuse to do whatever he wanted and be horrible to me. It is NOT. WORTH. IT.

That's an especially shitty thing to say. And what does she mean anyway? As in if she spunks all her money up the wall on trips and her business goes under, it's your job to fund her lifestyle? If she's worried about failing, she should be investing extra cash in her business, or hoarding it for future tough times.

Ultimately it's her life not yours - you're not hugely entwined yet, but you're right, this reflects a difference in values which could well be a problem going forwards. Trouble is you either need to decide now that it's unworkable, or else wait until you hit a major problem that directly affects you in the future, and try to resolve it then. But if you're more cautious and she's more of a spender, you're going to hit a roadblock one way or another.

112,"Maybe he’s projecting- people who are cheating or crossing other boundaries are often more suspicious of their partners, because they know what people are capable of. Or they want to reject guilt by convincing themselves that the other person is crossing lines, too.

116,"&gt;I told her that I dont want to go every weekend

Reasonable

&gt;""well I just dont feel like it.""

Totally fair

&gt; I told her she can go by herself and that its okay

Good compromise

&gt;she hated that I said that. 

Not cool.

Sometimes the weekend is for just doing *nothing*. Or just doing whatever you want. Feel like going to Target for one thing and the browsing for an hour? Great. Want to sit around and read a book? Cool. Go for a bike ride? Sure. Be available in case something comes up? Totally. Stay in bed all day? Also great.

You don't always need to have plans. You are allowed to do your own things that you want. Stand your ground on this one. If you want to get ahead of it try something like this:""Wife, we have no plans this weekend, but I am planning on using that time for xyz."" At least then you are setting the standard for what you want to use with that time so that she can't just say that you are trying to get out of seeing her parents"
117,"""Aww, you only get paid 15.50/hr? That's so little, I get paid 20/hr."" This is one of the things he was saying to her. Just to remind you all this, when you comment without reading the original post. "
118,"Never play favorites with your children if you want them to keep contact with you. Either support both or neither, equally. "
119,"""You were with a boy yesterday? WHERE DID YOU HIDE THE BABY?"""
120,"This. 

I was engaged once. Looking back wr just weren't right for each other. Like at all. But obviously I wouldn't have been planning to marry him if I'd realized that then. 

He initiated the breakup. *I* wanted no contact. Just let me move on. 

Nope.

First he wanted to be friends. So I tried treating him like a friend. Maybe I fucked that up, idk, because how do you be friends with someone you started out DATING and planned to marry? We didn't have a ""go back to being friends"" to fall back on. 

Then I was ""acting too much like we were in a relationship"".

So I backed off.

Then it was ""Why are you ignoring me?""

Then it was ""If we can work out (issue) maybe we can give it another try"". 

Then it was ""You're trying too hard to force us back together"".

Then it was ""You always seem mad at me what did I do?""

It ended with him screaming at me ""IT'S OVER WE'RE DONE WE'RE NOTHING WE ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AGAIN WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT????!!""

Turned out he was trying to ""let me down easy"" and hoped I'd ""get the hint and move on"". When HE kept pushing for contact and *I* originally hadn't wanted any. 

It wasn't about me. It was about his conscience. 

Obviously I realize now I should have just told him to stop with the back and forth games ad fuck off. But I was 24 and this was my first long term serious relationship. Now of course I'd say ""You ended our relationship. Stick to that decision and let me move on. Boy bye."" and block him. I did allow much of what happened. 

But he also jerked me around for AN ENTIRE YEAR and turned what would have been a painful but ordinary breakup into a legitimate trauma that still colors my relationships in some ways even now. 

Just break up, state your reasons, and leave. She'll be better for it in the long run.
"
121,"&gt;We've hung out several times since, but whenever I bring up hanging out now she says 'no thanks, your 'me time' is clearly more important.' 

Wow. WOW. That is one immature, passive-aggressive statement. 

Time to adult. Sit her down. 'GF, we are not a joint human. We have different needs. I'm sorry if time alone makes you feel like I'm rejecting you. I'm not. I'm valuing myself. Time to myself lets me recharge and get excited(!) about seeing you the next day. It seems this makes you feel insecure. What can we do?'"
122,"I don't really have good advice because I'm having a hard time getting past what a POS your boyfriend is.  Especially given that he apparently can't even correctly identify some random nude photo as not being you but still won't admit to being wrong. AND he even checked your phone for evidence and failed to find any.  What an utter jerk.

I think I would probably start getting angry and dump him over the fact that he won't take you at your word on this one, even when he has proof of 'innocence'.  At the very least there would be no more nude snapchats, ever, because he doesn't deserve that."

I hope this sets your mind a little bit at ease."
127,"This, OP. Though to be perfectly honest, there is still a huge chance that even if you were to tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, he *still* won't understand, though not for a lack of trying. People who come from loving homes and who are consequently well adjusted individuals will never truly understand what being raised by dysfunctional, maladjusted people can do to a person, especially as they often feel that their experience is (or should be) universal. They get it, in theory, but they often fall back on the ""But...she's your mother, she loves you no matter what, I'm sure you can work it out!"" spiel.

133,It is definitely not the first time. It’s to the point where it’s almost become normal.
134,It sounds like your girlfriend was deeply upset by those two experiences of people creeping around inside &amp; outside her home &amp; like she hasn’t worked through that yet. The camera &amp; obsessive watching are definitely reactions to that. I don’t think asking to remove the cameras will work if I’m correct &amp; she’s still freaked out by those invasions. Maybe you can express concern about that &amp; ask that she see someone to work through it. I totally understand why you don’t want cameras on you while you’re in your own home - I’m just saying I don’t think telling her she’s overreacting etc will get you what you want. 
135,"You BOUGHT the tickets?? You took the time off work?? And she changed her mind last minute...that is...insane. Why didn't you just go and stay somewhere else? Yes, I get that that's more expensive, but I would've found a cheap-ish hotel, parked my butt on the beach, not spoken to her for two weeks and said ""sup?"" on the return plane with a tan. She is NOT a good girlfriend. The models are a red herring. This was planned for 9 months. You should have still been invited, and you should have gone anyway alone. What on earth did she tell her family?? "
136,"I'd drop her now.  Return the dress, shoes, anything you've bought that you don't want to keep and walk out of her life. She clearly does not respect you, nor does she care for you aside from your involvement in making her wedding get to its end goal. 

She sounds like she's become a wretch to have in anyone's life, and deserves nothing from you. However I think it would be important to tell her. Something along the lines of: 

*""I need you to understand I will not be participating in your wedding party, or wedding any longer. I understand you are excited and busy preparing for your event, however there is no reason or excuse to be so unkind and disrespectful to me and my family. I feel that I have been a good friend to you, that we were bestfriends, but your lack of empathy for my mother fighting cancer, and disrespect towards me and my husband when you told others about my early pregnancy after I swore you to secrecy has shown me that you must not consider me a friend. I am hurt beyond words and therefore must withdraw from your wedding. Take care.*"
137,"Everyone has summed it up nicely so far. I want to add that I highly recommend you get a lawyer before proceeding with the divorce. 
""how much money he believes I need to pay him in order to keep possession of my dogs"" Dealing with him sounds like it's going to be a treat. :/"
138,"I’ve (31F) been looking into having a shoot like this and with seasoned, high-end photographers it’s $1k and up. 

I’ve done some photography as well (behind the camera) and it’s not uncommon to build a portfolio using friends as models. There is a lot of style in this kind of photography and if he’s invested in the equipment he’s probably serious about building his book. I see where this arrangement can be totally innocent...albeit, weird since you’re buddies.

While you may inquire into her thought process, it’s unfair to  automatically hold her in contempt, especially when it seems to have come from a good place. Good way to talk about boundaries in a relationship. It may be naive, and kind of weird given that you’re friends, but it’s possible she didn’t think of that and was strapped for cash. "
139,"This is WILD, my dude, what the shit happened in your past life to make your whatnots retreat so far into your whosit? ""Degenerate waste of time""? Do you ever... Do anything... For fun? Video game? Eat a tub of ice cream? The world is your oyster, my guy. You don't get happiness out of some kinda weird purism like this (clearly...). You get it from chilling the heck out sometimes."
140,"&gt; Before you move, try this: Don't avoid her. Every time you see her say ""Sorry, I can't talk right now"" and NOTHING else. Then say nothing to her the rest of the time she follows you. Give it a week or two.

I think it would be helpful if she didn't let this woman follow her. She needs to literally tell her, ""Please stop following me. We know you listen for our front door to open and it's really creeping us out. You need to stop this and please leave us alone."" 

I'm just afraid that if OP uses roundabout phrases like, ""I'm busy!"" there's the implication that, ""Sometimes I *won't* be busy and then I'll have time to talk"". So she will keep listening for the door and engaging them every single time. In her mind eventually they won't be too busy! 

People like this don't take hints. You need to be firm. At this point there should be no hinting that a future friendship is possible. They're so uncomfortable they are considering moving -- the time for polite hints is over. "
141,"If you look around there are forums for women like you. I don't know what they are exactly but I bet if you google you can find them. A lot of women feel like this. You're not a bad person or unnatural or anything else. You're a person with deeply conflicted feelings about a big part of your life, and that's okay.

It might really help you to be able to talk to other people with the same experience, just so you know you aren't alone."

And actions have consequences: my mother was so pissed that she left her half of the house and business to me instead of him, with the consequence that he was still working two jobs at 75.

150,"Having ""me time"" is important to a relationship. My boyfriend and I are usually attached at the hip; we live together, we have the same hobbies, we play the same games, I drive him to the bus station on my way to work every morning, etc. Even so, every Thursday he goes out with his buddies and I get the house to myself. On Monday I went out with my girlfriends and he got the house to himself. I go to the gym after work almost every day by myself, and he sometimes holes himself up in our study with the door closed so he can write with no interruptions. Being together is important, but being okay apart is important as well.

I do wonder about your phrasing, though, if she got so hurt. If you started out saying ""I feel like having time apart from each other,"" she might have thought you were trying to tell her you wanted to take a break from the entire relationship and freaked out."

164,"I have a few mixed feelings about this as someone who's both shot nudes of other people and has professionally had nudes taken of myself. 

When I started out, I couldn't tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys in terms of who was or wasn't shady to work with. If you only know one guy with a camera (who you trust), it doesn't provide much scope into the community as a whole, and it sends your comfort level to a weird place.  I think it's easy to be flattered by the newly presented idea of ~being a model~, and with that, it makes it easy for people to push your boundaries around (especially when they're giving you the opportunity to get the pictures for free).

Most guys I worked with were nice and never said anything remotely inappropriate to me, but I remember this one guy who had previously taken pictures of me who later talked about working together in his apartment. He said ""If we get bored with shooting, I have alcohol ;)"" That was the point where I realized that not all of the photographers are in it to build their portfolios! If this guy has a serious studio in his space though, it might be a different story, but I'd be concerned over someone who was a little too eager for this to happen. I think she probably thought he was just being nice and might not have read too much into his niceness. 

Regarding things with your girlfriend, maybe I'd ask a few more questions. Ask if he had ever shot that kind of work before. Did she sign any papers?  Ask who suggested the poses (like were her legs spread/was she touching herself versus was it just her posed on a chair/standing around looking pretty/etc?). Also, most girls I know that do shoots for their boyfriends go for lingerie, not full nudes, so that strikes me as sort of weird if this was her first time doing this with this random guy.  How long did the photo session last? What happened afterwards - did she just get dressed and go home, or did they hang out?"
165,Arrange a new place for them to go (forget selling them). Take them out one by one (starting with the boy) over a few weeks and tell him they died.
166,"That's a really callous way for him to respond. Maybe nudes just aren't his thing anymore, but he should have just explained that to you instead of acting like a bored child.

Have an honest conversation with him. Tell him that he hurt your feelings, which is why you ended up not wanting sex that night. Tell him that you want to improve things, but that you can't do it on your own. Ask him what his wants and needs are, and express your own. You're gonna need him on board if things are going to get better."

168,"OP, do not give up on your dream of dancing and having a perfectly normal and healthy social and active life that you need for your own emotional health.  Do not end up like my mother, who is now in her late 60s and is brainwashed but also very aware of how much she missed out on and has become quite bitter.

My dad did the exact same thing to my mom. Whined, bitched and moaned and made her feel terribly guilty whenever she wanted to engage in a harmless, normal hobby that made him insecure. Whined when she joined a gym, so she joined an all female gym. He then complained and whined that the aerobics teacher was male, so my mom stopped those dance classes she loved.  Then he obsessed that ""lesbians in the female gym"" just HAD to be checking my mom out because she was looking prettier and fitter.

He controlled her life. It was awful and she caved. Every single time she wanted to better herself he was terrified she'd get too confident and leave him. She had no intentions of leaving him, zero history of flirting or cheating, 100% loyal. Same when she wanted to take community college classes. He was so negative and whined about her not being home two nights a week for a few hours so she caved and quit.

He ended up building her a goddamn home gym with heavy blinds on the windows. And she has holed herself up in that gym. No more dance classes.  He's isolated her from her fun, outgoing female friends. I'm talking about responsible, married women who had interesting, active lives, most with young kids, who got together for coffee once or twice a week. That intimidated him too.

I asked her many times why she was just caving to his insecurities. Reminded her that she was missing out on what she loved, on the dancing and socializing that was necessary for her and her character, just because he has crazy, unfounded, out of control insecurities.

She told me (with an utterly broken look) ""when you really love someone, you learn to make sacrifices.""  That's how she justified it in her mind. (She also tried using this manipulative tactic on me when I became an independent adult and bought my own motorcycle, or dated a guy they didn't like, or didn't have a religious wedding, etc.)

You realize his behavior will only get worse, right? That this all stems from his deep insecurities.  Please do not end up like my mom. She told me he was so impossible to deal with.  Never was there a threat of violence, just emotionally exhausting, manipulative complaining, rule-setting, acting hurt that she ""needed"" to do these things"", questioned why she wanted to dance and made her feel like she was doing something wrong, all of which is emotionally abusive behavior. Over the years she morphed into two personalities - the little girl, obedient personality when around him, and the outgoing, strong woman when he's not around. Its obvious to everyone. 

Get to couple's therapy. Do it for your marriage, for you and for your kids.  Make no mistake - your husband will have those same insecurities as your kid gets older.  Once your child starts developing their personality and character and is no longer the kid that worships everything their parents do, your husband is going to lose it again and get unreasonably controlling with the kid.

This can ruin relationships and families.  My dad let my brother  do whatever he wanted, but as the female the rules were different and I was expected to be some nun.  My mother became insanely jealous of me when I started up ballet as a kid and made me quit pointe the day after my first class (I will never forget the look of rage on her face when I was getting fitted for pointe shoes. Not until I was an adult did it click that she was angry because that had always been her dream but she let it go.)  My mother was jealous that I put my foot down and insisted on doing what I wanted, such as riding a motorcycle, which was another one of her secret dreams she didn't even dare mention to him as she knew his reaction would be crazy.  So, when I did those activities, she resented me and it fucked up our relationship for life. 

After decades of my mom obeying my dad and normalizing his behavior, he also could not accept that I would perhaps have different desires or ideas for my life. My brother, who had a free pass for everything, thinks controlling a woman is normal.  My mother is broken and does nothing she loves and has no friends.  And I have no contact with my family, as I could no longer bear the screaming and guilt trips that I was a selfish daughter for not doing what my parents wanted.

I know it sounds dramatic. But get this insecurity of his under control now while you still can.  He also needs to wake the fuck up and start being a parent, not a resentful babysitter."

For me, it would be time for the nuclear option:

I'd talk to Jacob *in front of Ryan*.

That's her problem, not yours. Anyway:

There's no way this was a ""casual"" aside. The bride mentioned it to test the waters, to see if you'd go, ""oh wow, your MIL is right, allow me to demote myself."" In any case, she clearly has someone in the wings to replace you with. 

With no disrespect meant, you're only a maid-of-honour. The success of the wedding is not dependent on you. If you walk out now, your friend will throw a tantrum, will  elevate someone else to the position, and the wedding will continue on as planned. Sure, she'll tank your friendship over it, but it's tanked anyway. She has no respect for you or your family. It's far better to leave now and give her two months to pick up the pieces, than to go through the next two months-worth of wedding-related events seething with anger and betrayal whilst trying to pretend you adore her.

&gt; Or act like a civilized human and go through with the wedding?

What do you think of this friend? Is he sleazy? Is he trustworthy? If you were to ask him to delete the photos, would you trust him to do so?

I've done some photowork, including some sexy ones. Some photographers (even amateur ones) are incredibly professional in their manner and will treat a sexy photoshoot the same as taking photos of a bowl of fruit. And some will use a photoshoot as a way to flirt or perv on girls. Which category do you think your friend falls into?"

200,"I am not a professional photographer, but I do work in the film and photography industries. I’ve worked with some of the most well-known photographers in the US and I’ve also worked on sleazy porno shoots. 

I have an interest in photography. It’s a hobby, but I’m good at it. I enjoy the process and have fun with it which is exactly the reason I don’t pursue it professionally. 

I’ve done the same thing your friend has done on many occasions. If someone wants to creatively collaborate with me and we can work out a good time for it, I’m usually down to take on the project. I’ve personally shot everything from straight up pornography to bizarre avant- grade art projects for free because it’s fun to do. Anyone I collaborate with does it of their own free will and own personal agency. Their personal relationships are not my concern and not my business. Frankly, I couldn’t give a fuck if someone’s SO got mad about something I worked on because it wasn’t their project. 

Now, to OP’s situation, here’s the deal:  Your girlfriend loves and cares about you. She did a really cool and thoughtful thing for you. She gave you a unique and special present that goes way beyond buying you a new TV or guitar or Yeezy’s or whatever it is you’re into. It’s intimate and personal. You said before that “she’s not dumb, but she isn’t clever” and probably didn’t consider that you wouldn’t like your friend seeing her nude. That said, she probably went to him specifically because she trusts him. She trusted him to be professional in a space where she is completely vulnerable. I think the fact that she trusts your friend says a lot more about the situation than you’re giving credit for. I’m not sure where you live, but from being in the industry, I know that there are A LOT of sleezebags out there. In your girlfriend’s mind she calculated the risk of potentially working with a sleezebag versus someone she trusts. You also said she asked your friend if he knew anyone and he offered to do it. He may not know anyone, or may not have trusted anyone to be as professional as he would be with your girlfriend. Here’s another thing to consider:  Professional photographers are EXPENSIVE. I like to think that my work is of professional quality, and I’d also add without being hyperbolic that it’s better than some of the professionals I work with. Working with your friend meant that there weren’t super strict time constraints, which always yields higher quality output. Working with someone she trusted also lets her be more comfortable and relaxed, which also almost always yields better results. Working with your friend saved your girlfriend HUNDREDS if not well over a thousand dollars. 

OP, I understand the knee-jerk reaction is to be angry, but you’re clearly trying to be thoughtful about this. Take into consideration that none of this was done maliciously, with ill-intent, or for any other reason than to give you a cool fucking present. "

One thing to keep in mind is that the misguided stereotype you grew up with (the man *must* be taller) was probably part of her cultural conditioning, too. Men are made to feel unmasculine for being shorter, while women are made to feel unfeminine for being taller. It’s something you’ll both get used to, but do keep in mind that she may feel awkward about it, too.

It’ll help if you stop thinking about your role in those interactions as “being the girl.” You’re probably hugged taller men in your life, right? It wasn’t a big deal, and neither is this.

Every woman you’ve ever been with, you probably had to adjust a few things about how you hugged or otherwise interacted with them. Some women have large chests and you hug a little differently to keep from smooshing her. Some girls are very short and you modify your hug so you’re not smashing her face into your gut. Etc., etc. You’ll find your way with your girlfriend, too.

I do get what you’re saying - there are some physical interactions we have that reinforce our gender roles in a way that can be comforting. Putting your hand on the small of her back as you walk together is one of those, and won’t be affected by height.

My partner is a full foot taller than me, but prefers to be the “little spoon.” So when I’m in back, I’m the “jetpack.” You either adjust yourself a little higher and throw a leg over the top for more coverage, or stay in the normal position and nestle your face in her neck. Either way is pretty nice.

I get that you don’t want to stand up on your tiptoes to kiss her, and she probably doesn’t want you pulling her face down to kiss you. Cupping her face gently - one hand on each side of her jaw - is a pretty hardwired stimulus, and she’ll naturally move her face towards yours for a kiss. Shoulder smooches and chin pecks are nice, too.

This stuff will come naturally to you in time, as you learn about how you two fit together. Soon enough, you won’t even remember the height difference when you’re kissing and hugging. 

Folks will probably come here and say that you’re overthinking it. You are, a little, but it’s clear that a lot of it is coming from the perspective of wanting to make *her* feel more comfortable, and that’s a good instinct! You’re going to do just fine together :)"

Your daughter is 3. She needs her own room and her own bed - if for no other reason than having her in bed with you is inhibiting *your* sleep. I have, in my life, had some of my absolute worst emotional and physical outbursts due to having my sleep screwed up. I am **not in any way** trying to suggest that what he did wasn't fucking terrible. It was. But I do not think this is necessarily a sign that your husband will become a monster. 

Is there any way you can move your daughter out of your shared bed and into a room of her own?"
226,"It doesn't sound like he wants to lose weight at all. And until he wants to do it, it won't happen. He'll just keep gaining until he eats himself to death.

If he really says he wants to lose weight, it sounds like he'd benefit from a therapist more than a trainer at this point.
"
227,"&gt; I honesetly feel regret for not leaving her

Leave now, don't look back. Leave.

She's cheated on you, one time confirmed and suspected multiple other times - emotional relationships with others is still a form of cheating, so is seeking sexual gratification outside a relationship.

She's been cheating on you more than she hasn't been.

&gt; Do i end my now stable, healthy relationship...

It maybe stable now but it ws build on shaky ground: lies, and infidelity. 

Again... leave?"

229,"Its not at all stupid to cry over what you heard. Its disgusting and hurtful and I would be upset too. 

It sounds like confrontation might be hard for you, but perhaps you should bring this up with your brother before deciding to just not go. You could express that you're feeling very troubled after you heard her talk about her feelings of you being there. Tell him that it hurt. Let him know how it feels. He won't get I until you express it. If he takes her side or agrees with her, then OP, he is a seriously bad brother. That's me putting it nicely. "
230,"I think it's more that she seems to enjoy the baby a lot more than other people, so he finds it validating. He wants to talk about the baby and show it off, she seems to enjoy seeing the pictures and it makes him proud of his kid."

...you know, like absolutely no one would ever do.

"
233,"Only you can decide if it's a deal breaker. But there are things to consider:

Does it bother you that she places money/profit over the feelings of family and friends? 

How is she profiting by you living in her home? Are you actually paying her entire mortgage and don't know it?

What happens if you get married, have a child, and get divorced? Will she hold that child hostage to get more money from You? 

What exactly is she willing to do to get ahead and make a profit?



"
234,"Yes OP shouldn't have done that, but that's also a first class manipulation tactic and it's not OP's fault she fell for it. It follows the framework of 1. Shitty person does something socially maladjusted, 2. Normal person reacts normally by setting boundaries, 3. Shitty person turns it around so normal person feels like the bad guy."
235,"What's most important is you and your son's safety and well-being and that's what you should base your decision on. Being that this *just* happened, he is not in a stable place, and that makes me worry about you and your son staying with him right now. Perhaps you can find a place to stay temporarily for the two of you to go while your husband works on himself and just see how things progress. Talking to a professional might be beneficial for you as well, to process what happened and work out what to do next. "
236,"Dude. Maybe when everyone else is the asshole, you're the asshole."
237,"50k more than what you're making now and that's not enough of an incentive for him to move?

It's Alabama. Making 50k a year *on its own* can net you a really nice house and fun toys. It's got one of the lowest economic thresholds in America. You can rent a really, really nice apartment for less than 1000/month.

It sounds like your husband is more interested in furthering his own path than yours, and is reflecting that on you by claiming you're choosing your career over him. It's the other way around- he doesn't want to move for a great opportunity *for you* when he would have an equivalent job waiting for him.

It would be different if he was all for it and there were complications with his transfer. Shutting it down before even investigating what the opportunities are for him are troubling."
238,He’s not trying to test her for pregnancy/drugs.  He’s trying to manipulate and control her by making her so afraid her dad will barge into her room while she’s sleeping to test her to do those things later.
239,"THIS!!

/u/knok022 Hear me when I say it is not petty to burn everything to ground. Do not allow them time to get their story together and ""win"" the loyalty of your mutual friends by telling their side first! You bet with a ton of lies about *you*! (i.e., she was unhappy because you're abusive, made her feel bad about herself, and best friend was the stand up guy who rescued her.)

You want your other friends to be outraged on your behalf and definitely not ""neutral"" -- this is how it will go down if mutual friends proclaim they want to be neutral and stay friends with both of you..

* By still inviting the new couple to everything actually legitimize the relationship which low key pushes you *out* because you won't want to constantly be around the two people who hurt you deeply. 

* Meanwhile, you're unhappy and not as fun to be around as the new couple so mutual friends end up hanging out with *them* more. 

* After a few weeks or months you feel completely abandoned and no longer close to your mutual friends.

* You feel unsupported and like all your friends are cool with cheating because it didn't personally happen to *them*.

####So get ahead of this -- confide in mutual friends what you've learned. Don't be diplomatic. Be real."
240,"Your friend was willing to put you in not only an uncomfortable situation but a few potentially dangerous ones (sleeping on some dude’s couch, drink driving).

Something that stands out to me is you keep saying she wouldn’t *let* you call your mom. Do you always let her tell you what to do? She was a lousy friend but you could have called your mom or an Uber at any time, and should have. Sometimes it’s hard to say no, but it’s a skill worth working on. "
241,"&gt;Anytime I try and say it makes me feel he always says “ that’s something I can’t quantify stay on the topic at hand”

I shuddered reading that. How utterly condescending. What he's basically saying is: ""Acknowledging your feelings makes me uncomfortable, so I'm going to define them out of existence by labelling them irrational and off-topic."" 

How each partner feels is a CRITICAL component of any healthy marriage. Like.... people are human and it's not possible to be in tune 24/7, but a marriage cannot function if there isn't baseline concern for that. By dismissing that, your husband may score ""rationality"" points in his own mind on small battles, but in the larger picture he has a totally irrational approach to his marriage."
242,"I think you need to speak with a lawyer about a cease and desist letter to start. She could potentially ruin your life with this behavior. You should also seriously think about completely cutting contact with her for a year or two until

247,"Your husband is staying out multiple times a week drinking (and doing god knows what) till 3am while you’re at home with a baby and is getting mad that you’re *dancing* 

For all you know he could be cheating on you, grinding up against girls, insert whatever paranoia he applies to you here. And yet he’s allowed to do that.

Do you hear that? It’s the sound of a double standard smacking you in the face. "
248,"Seconded.  Listen to your instincts on this one.

If he comes to the relationship on unequal standing, you’re never going to be true partners.

And if all he can afford is $400 a month while your cost of living is almost 7x that, then he needs to get his life in order before he will be an equal partner.

(I’m not saying both halves of a couple should be able to afford the same things or make the same amount of money, but when there’s THAT big a disparity, I would think long and hard about letting them move in with me- because once he’s in, it’s going to be hell getting him out again if things go south.)"
249,"You're not being dramatic at all. You set a clear boundary with her and told her what you wanted for your child, and she deliberately violated that boundary. And she's violated your child's bodily autonomy. Fuck that. Your husband is right about her being toxic. There's no reason to have this woman in your child's life at this level. You can visit her - with supervision. She's shown she can't be trusted with your child. "
250,I think this one might be counselor-worthy. It sounds like your husband is underestimating just how much a tiny human demands from you and how much your lives will change when the baby arrives. 
251,"Yeah, ""I'm not blocking you but don't contact me"" is a fancy, embossed, gold-edged invitation to drama."
252,"Take the job! Im sure your family and friends would want you to take it as well. Who knows, maybe your girlfriend could work in the same area too &amp; if not yet theres plenty of people who have done and are doing long distance.

253,"Direct, to the point, honest and no bullshit. Don't leave him hanging on with hope and don't throw ""maybe, if, possibly"" out there. Rip the band aid off. It's a sign of respect. "
254,"&gt;Did I make a mistake by not telling my boyfriend to deal with it?

Hell no, good for you."
255,I have to disagree with a lot of the responses OP is getting. I am very much like the friend: amateur photographer with a studio and a lot of experience. When I'm shooting I am interested in the results - beautiful photos - not anything else. Perhaps OP's GF was more comfortable working with someone she knew and not a stranger. I would recommend NOT jumping to the conclusion of the friend being a perv or interested in the GF.
256,Just break up now.  He isn't independent enough to be in the kind of relationship you need.  And you don't have the time and energy to be what he needs.

259,"One of my friends was in a car accident before I knew her. It was pretty bad but she wasn't left with any lasting physical damage. Like you though, she had some issues with driving, specifically overtaking vehicles. After a while she had therapy about dealing with the anxiety and she found a driving instructor who could do advanced driving training and was used to dealing with people with fears.

I offer this not to tell you to sort yourself out or that I agree with your friends, but just to say there are ways to deal with your fears if you want to and when you're ready.

In the mean time, your friends are being dreadful. Tell them you have PTSD about it, which in all likelihood you probably do, mildly. Ask them if they'd be hassling a vet to go the gun range if they had PTSD and if they say no, then ask why they want you to put yourself in a stressful and painful situation. And then make friends who live nearer you :-)"
260,I show men multiple pictures of my frisbee when they show me more than one photo of their bike. They look at me like I'm crazy.  
261,"Umm, I hate to say this... but your husband sounds like a sociopath.  None of these things he is engaging in are normal.  Combined together, it sounds like he has a basic disregard for human life.

He’s basically stalking a woman, stealing from the most vulnerable people, has extreme sexual/porn fetishes, and actively sabotaging someone who is his friend.

If this is all new &amp; abnormal, I would suggest he go see a doctor to assess if he has some mental health issues or brain abnormalities that have just now manifested.  Otherwise, your husband is not a well man.  "

Why did you marry a person which such strong feelings about something you don't agree with (I assume you are okay administering medication as part of your job). Why would you even ask for his permission to seek medical treatment? How can you love that? What if  your child gets sick?

I guess the big question is do you believe in modern medicine or do you believe in asking God for help and nothing more?"
265,Apparently OP lives in Venezuela which is economically depressed. Maybe she thinks his mom’s stuff is nicer.
266,"You're not a united front. You do not support his decision. You don't even agree with it.

268,"3k just for rent? Good grief. What all does the other 4K go to? Because right now y’all are living way above her means, it’s no wonder she can’t always contribute. You either need to find a way to cut costs or move somewhere cheaper."
269,"&gt;He does seem to genuinely care about me but it could be because I basically support everything. I make the money... he lives in my house.

271,[deleted]
272,"I'll be honest I've been like your husband before in my past, that feelings didn't matter if something didn't make logical sense. 

It's a bit of a dirty trick really, because it is entirely because his decisions are still based on his feelings as well but he probably doesn't realize it as he thinks he is very logical, rational and that feelings can't be quantified so they're worthless. What he's doing is basically using what seems to be logic and facts, to justify his feelings as being more correct than yours.

However in the example you gave his reasons aren't really that logical, but rather something he merely feels. 

&gt;“we’re not driving 18 hours to visit for 12. It just doesn’t make sense”

This is a feeling from him not a fact, or logical statement. He feels it doesn't make sense but it's impossible to say that is a fact. 
Many people will travel for something that is an important weddings, anniversaries, or funerals.  

Him thinking it doesn't make sense is just saying he doesn't feel your parents anniversary isn't important enough to attend because you'd have to drive so long to get there. 

The dog example could go either way really, dogs aren't an insignificant responsibility. However his reasoning seems off, it sounds more like he just doesn't want a dog. But he can't say that because he needs a logical reason, so he blames you by saying he doesn't want the responsibility and you can't handle it. 

&gt;Like I get that I am not perfect but it’s like he never considers my feelings when making a decisions. Sometimes it makes me feel like I am married to an unfeeling robot. At the end of every argument I feel like well yeah that does make sense but I am not getting what I want. 

It's not that he's an unfeeling robot, it's that he looks for logic to justify his feelings rather than just saying what he feels. For me the reason I did that was because I didn't think feelings alone could be a justification for something, that you needed to have some logical reason as well.

In terms of how to deal with it, is to make him actually realize what he's doing. However that's easier said than done, therapy may help. You could start calling him out more, on things that he is using logic to justify his feelings for. "
273,"He'd be using your skin to make a lamp shade. Kind of an obscure trope reference, but it's valid. The guy is seriously coming off as creepy."
274,"First of all, what has your BFF’s husband done to only get “visitation?”

Second, I wonder if maybe the husband is brainwashing your best friend to believe this. Doesn’t make it better, but it does change things a bit, you know?

How does she react if you play the devils advocate? "
275,She probably sees Alex as a son and OP is obv her daughter so it's squicky in her head.
276,[removed]
277,Paranoia at that level is a particularly bad psychiatric symptom. Your husband seems to be on the edge of a full psychotic break from reality. I would not hesitate in doing everything humanly possible to get him immediate help. Call the NAMI hotline and get access to resources in your area.
278,"Honestly? You don't. She's going to have to learn that there are consequences for being hateful and abusive, starting with her spouse and children. Express your disapproval of her attitude, your disappointment in her for trying to alienate your son, and suggest therapy. If you want, offer to go together so she's not alone. Loving someone does not mean you enable abusive behavior - you call them out on it and encourage them to grow. Your son has found love and happiness, he's trying to involve you both in his life, and that's hard when you're gay and it's obvious one of your parents disapproves.

My mom felt torn between my dad, my maternal grandparents, and me when I came out as a lesbian and they reacted poorly. Our relationship still hasn't quite healed and I don't trust her / involve her in my life beyond the bare minimum now. Is a relationship with your children important to you? You have to think about your priorities tbh.

If you love your son, go to his wedding with or without your wife, emphasize how happy and proud you are of him, and show him that you're in his corner. While I'd encourage your wife to do some serious self reflection and have her examine her priorities, you cannot control what she does. But you can - and should - make choices for yourself and the benefit of a healthy relationship with your children."
279,I'd just tell her you're hoping to hold onto them for your own future children. Nothing wrong with that.
280,"Or for fun, he could replace them one-by-one with stuffed animals and see how long it takes him to notice. (Probably not the best solution though.) "
281,"I mean, to be fair, it sounds like the gf has put the record straight without being asked, which must be pretty embarrassing for her (although not as bad as it was for OP! ) 
That would be a step in the right direction for me, she reacted very poorly but does seem to be trying to make amends."
282,"Stop trying to talk to your mother about this. Take a step back, sit down, and stop reaching for the phone. You need to let this sit for a while, take it in. Don't call her, don't go rushing back to her because then she'll either try to rugsweep this, or turn it into a battle. You don't need her permission, approval, or consent to get married - you don't need to 'fix' this immediately, even though every instinct in your body is telling you do.  

As adults, we make choices, and those choices have consequences. You chose to have a destination wedding, with limited guest availability, and are accepting that. You chose not to have a large, expensive wedding, that you don't want or need. You chose to offer to fly out your parents and you let them make the choice. The consequence to this is that you gave up the wedding you didn't want, and have made a decision to have the wedding you *do* want, even though it restricts who can be there. Fair enough. You do you. You didn't make these choices *at* your mother, or to hurt her. 

Your mother is an adult, and she is making a choice to make this all about herself. Your wedding is not about you, in her mind, it's about 'family' and 'obligation' and 'duty to others' and 'her needs above yours'. She has made the decision to punish you by screaming and yelling at you for not doing what she wants, and trying to guilt trip you into changing your mind. 

She could have congratulated you. She could have said plainly and simply, ""I'm disappointed that you aren't having a big, family wedding, but I still love and care about you, my daughter."" She could have said nothing and chosen to cry after she got off the phone. She could have chosen to accept the very generous offer of a hotel, house sitting, and flights to attend her daughter's wedding. She didn't. Instead, she chose to yell at you, shame you into changing your mind, and hurt you because you weren't doing what she wanted. 

Think about that. ****The happiest part of your life is about to begin, and your mother doesn't jump for joy or help you - she tries to tear it down and make it about her needs and her feelings.****

Go out, stop texting her for now, and then go get some counselling with  ~~your partner~~ someone who specialized in family relationships re: your mom. He is your first priority now; how does he feel about this? What does he feel is the right course of action now?
"
283,Bucket of crabs really. All too common. 
284,"So, to give you something else to think about, as people's comments do not seem to be hitting the mark:

Children, if you want them, will grow up believing it's perfectly OK for men to control women. Any daughter you have will not be allowed to form healthy relationships with men, platonic or romantic. And if you have a boy he will be shown that respecting women's autonomy is not really needed. 

Is that something you'd be OK with?"
285,Also chip him in your name. Vets often default ownership to whoever the microchip is registered to.
286,"My jaw just continued to drop... and drop... and drop. Um so yeah first off that type of relationship is not normal. I can understand you thinking it's jealousy but no. My mom has always treated my brother differently too, she would hit me, say mean things to me, and expect things of me that she would never with him. And that all made me extremely jealous of their relationship and wishful that she'd be like that with me. But their relationship was never, ever like... that. So you being jealous has nothing to do with that. As someone else mentioned it does sound like mental health is involved in this and your mom coddling him is making him confused on what is ""normal"" and ""not normal."" Tbh I have no idea how you can even begin to solve this problem so I'm sorry that I can't be of any help, I just wanted to reassure you that you're not being crazy about thinking there's something underlying. But keep in mind to be healthy mentally as well when trying to handle it, be strong and always have good intentions."
287,"You’re not being immature and she’s not being too aggressive. You just want different things.

289,"Trust me when I say that a 72 hour psych hold is no walk in the park. If he is faking, he will be severely regretting his decision to do so and it's likely the psych hold will cure him of any desire to do this again.

Provide the doctors evaluating him with all information you have (including his search history) and allow them to use their professional expertise to figure out whether he is in a legitimate health crisis or not. Even if he is faking, the fact that he is willing to do that is a sign that his mental health is pretty poor right now.

&gt;If anyone could make some sense of this I'd be so grateful.

Try to be patient and take care of yourself right now. Then listen to what the doctors have to say - you can start to make decisions on that information."
290,"Therapy doesn't solve base incompatibilities. Nothing can. It sounds like you married this guy too young and not firm about what you wanted out of life or a partnership, and now that you've aged into having firmer opinions, there's no fixing these fundamental differences.

291,"I am so sorry that happened, it must have been so shocking.

It's good that you realize that you must leave him even though it makes you sad. You're correct that you can't stay after this. 

It's hard having the rug ripped from under you like that, but you need to protect yourself first and foremost. "
292,"&gt; We already talked to the doctor about depression but he doesn't think that's the issue and he said this is not totally abnormal.

Get a second opinion. Depression isnt ""totally abnormal"" with pregnancy either. She needs a doctor to take her seriously and evaluate her seriously and treat her seriously. The current doctor is not by ignoring her and your concerns about the pain and hopelessness she is feeling."
293,"I think you buried the lede a little, as they say. The real problem here is that your ex destroyed your self-confidence, and made you feel like your choices were bad. Let me take a moment to say

FUCK that shit

because what he's done is make you afraid to open up about what you like to other people. 

People are probably turned off that you're dodging a socially common question. First of all pop music can be amazing. But also, no one will judge you if you're like ""I've gotten sucked into this wonderful audiobook, it's so good I haven't listened to music in days"" or whatever.

Screw that guy, he's not around anymore to tell you what to like. You're a good person who's curious about cool things. No sane person will judge you for that. "
294,"&gt; She knew about this at least somewhat and when I went to talk to her about it she said she didn’t want to know and wanted to stay out of it.


This makes things so much easier then OP! If she didn't want to be an adult and acknowledge her father being abusive enough to be arrested, then you have ZERO obligation to be invested in her struggle to financially maintain her father's wellbeing. "
295,"I'd just have your SO approach the husband and say something along the lines ""hey, sorry if this is embarrassing but our walls are pretty thin and for the past few months the loud sex has been waking up our kid, is there any way we could ask your wife and her other partners to try and keep it down during the wee hours?''

Frame it without accusation and with understanding and let the cards fall where they may. "
296,"She doesn't want to talk to you because she knows what she's doing is wrong. She's been having an emotional affair for a year with a married man and wants to keep her head buried in the sand.

She met him online? Does she even know his wife has cancer? My friend was conned like that. Turns out there was nothing wrong with the wife and he was having mutiple affairs."
297,"My passive agressive way of handling this one would be to let your mom do all of the research of exactly what she wants and then just continually shut down every tattoo idea she suggests.

""I don't think a dragon riding a tiger who is eating a watermelon fits with my personal aesthetic""

""I'm not a fan of how full color tattoos look, for me""

""I looked up that flower and it's symbolic of herpes in Patagonia""

""I don't want any more signature tattoos because I'll start to look like someone's broken leg cast""

Just keep pushing the work of doing research off onto her and then shooting down every idea she has; she will eventually get tired and hopefully give up.

299,A solid comment for many situations in life. 
300,"Reality Check: Your partner is actually making a reasonable income for being only 2 years deep into a freelance career as a fiction author. Seriously. Good for her. 

There are two problems here as I see it. The first is the issue of values. Your values and hers don't quite line up, and that may or not be manageable. The age difference is likely part of that, but it's not the main cause of the difference. You're different people. The second problem is the more practical one, which is that you are, as a couple, living way far beyond her means as an individual, but you are both still trying to take an individualistic perspective on your finances. 

She's not making 33% of what you are. She is likely making less than 20% of what you are. So yes, all of her income is going towards the basic necessities of your apartment. That's the reality of the situation. Your life together is too expensive for her.

So what do you do? I don't know really. There is a reality here that you don't like, but it's not helping you not to face it. Your real issue here is that you are not comfortable with the limitations you're working with and that you are fearful of making tough choices in regards to your future life together.

I'd recommend talking to a therapist to figure out what your own goals and priorities are and what you’re comfortable compromising on. You know that you and your partner don't have the same goals and priorities. What you don't know yet is if this is a dealbreaker. I'd suggest you get someone else involved in the conversation to help you sort out your own thoughts here."
301,"Or she's not educated about healthy weight management/eating and is genuinely concerned, because she's her mother.

I'm a physician, and you'd be amazed at peoples' misunderstanding of healthy weight loss, healthy calorie intake, etc. It sounds like OP didn't restrict her calories excessively, but a 100lb weight loss in a year is dramatic. If her mother is ignorant about weight loss, which I'd guess she is if she is morbidly obese, this probably seems alarming.

My advice would be to ask your GP to talk to you and your mom about your weight loss, so your mother can learn a little bit about the process from a source she trusts (a doctor, rather than a teenager, though it sounds like you know your stuff!). Bring up your mother's concerns to your doctor so she can prepare for the conversation, and make an appointment to bring your mom in."
302,"Just FYI, there’s software you can use to turn your laptop webcam into a motion sensor. I used it when I was having landlord issues to see if he was coming into my bedroom when I was out. It saves footage to your hard drive and won’t show up as an extra wifi device. Might be worth checking out. "
303,"Don't feel ashamed about following through on your suspicions, and don't just assume your mutual friends will choose him. 
Keep showing up, maintain connections, and let him deal with the discomfort of knowing that you are still around. You aren't in the wrong here."
304,"In my mind, the victim is the one who gets to decide how to deal with it. Your boyfriend is upset because he wants to deal with it in a way that enables him to maintain his friendship with the guy who groped you and not face weird questions from his friends. What he is concerned about here is not that you got groped but that things MIGHT be socially awkward for him. "
305,"&gt;  he got me pregnant and insisted on keeping her. He went ahead and told everyone I was pregnant and basically I felt too afraid of the stigma of backing out that I had her. I love her more than anything, and I'm grateful that I can be home with her but I'm starting to resent him too. He's slept with at least five of his co-workers before he got with me and I found this out much later...

This is personally far more concerning than everything else in this post. The choice to have a child should be something agreed by both parties, it should not be something you feel forced or guilted into doing. It is not fair for you and it is not fair for that child either. 

&gt; Now I just resent myself. I told him over and over I didn't want to be a military spouse.

You need to get yourself out of this situation. Nothing much you can do about your child at this point. But you seem to have zero say in this relationship, a decision **you** are making for yourself OP. He can't force you to have a kid, he can't force you to be a military wife. 

You have autonomy. Start using it. Go and see a therapist because your self esteem seems to be gone at this point. If you have no friends or family to turn to you need to become independent from this man. Birth control needs to be a priority, another child does not deserve to be brought into this world into this type of dynamic. You need to get your kid into some child care and get yourself a job so you can start staving.

Absolutely do not marry this man.  "
306,"I sincerely hope that you are a troll. If not, your husband is so far out of line here there's no way this doesn't end in divorce. There is so much wrong with his request, the way he did it, the way he presented it to you, the way he went behind your back, his personal (and obviously unresolved) history with this woman....

I would demand marriage counseling or divorce. That's really all."
307,Your mom is the ONLY one who signed up for this.
308,"Fair points. The tricky part is that we’re military living on base overseas. If they weren’t together, she would be gone. Wouldn’t live in the house. We have to straight up come with the entire truth, because the social graces aren’t really applicable here, unfortunately. Wish they were. I am glad to see that most people here seem to be in agreement that this fellow needs to know that’s been happening. We are homeowners with some land, so we’ve never yet had interactions with neighbors of this sort. This is a first for us. "
309,"She didn't cancel, she said she doesn't want to cook. Offer a simple take out option.

310,I bet OP being around is an almost daily reminder that her man is capable of  cheating on her even though they have a kid together. 
311,The part about “they were plotting to use my money for their own expenses” also sounded a lot like “my landlord wanted to charge me rent” to me. 
312,"This is actually really useful, thank you! I hadn't thought of asking him WHAT makes him flinch instead WHY. Maybe if he's willing to open about that,  I'll look into certain resources and try to present form to him. I just want him happy and safe!"

314,"I don't know about you, but when someone grabs my ass or boobs (aka sexually assaults me) my first instinct is to protect myself.  Generally only takes a couple beers to the face/elbows to the solar plexus for them to train themselves to check that it's actually their gf first.  Funny how that works.

I'd also stop trying to paper over uncomfortable situations- if he makes gross jokes in front of friends, call him out.  ""Stop acting like such a fucking creep, Jack.""  If he tries to pull the 'it's only a joke' you can respond ""Yeah, like it was only a joke when you climbed into my bed and wouldn't leave when I asked you to?""  Be loud and clear so all your friends know what he's doing, and you're all clear about how you hate it and what a creep he is.  You aren't attacking him, you're stating facts- if your sister is pissed tell her that you're only talking about what you're experiencing.  If Jack stops, so will you.

315,"Absolutely this. There’s no way his friend saw a pic of a girl he’s never seen nude and attributed it to you. It’s absurd. Your bf is in this group. And I can say this with certainty: I would recognize a nude of anyone I was currently sleeping with. Bodies are so distinct. There’s so many tiny details, the curve of a hip, density of hair, hell even boobs come in all the variety nature has to offer. None of this makes sense. I don’t know what reason he would have to lie but I have a hard time believing he thinks someone else’s nude pic is you."
316,"To add to this, even if she was genuinely interested, she just might not have the space
in her life for a relationship. "
317,Had he been involved in your job search? It seems odd that he's adding a salary restriction now. You're already picking one of his few places. You're young. You should take this job. 
318,"You should be able to look up the information for your area (look by city and state) for evicting a tenant.  In the US, the first step is to give a written Notice to Vacate (should be able to find a template online but should include the date of the notice, name of people you're giving it to, address of location, your name, and date they have to be out).  Make copies for both men and keep a copy for yourself in a secure location.  

Either mail the notice to each of them as certified mail or consider filming yourself handing it to them while telling them they have to be out by X date.

If they don't move out by the date on your notice, you take your proof of notice and go to the courthouse and file for eviction.

Good luck."
319,"He's a predator, plain and simple. No normal 25 year old is interested in dating a 16 year old."
320,"Your condition doesn’t devalue you as person, it’s a shame his fiancee is incapable of looking past something so superficial. 

Do NOT miss your brothers wedding, if you’re close with him it will hurt him tremendously, accept his offer and be his best man like he wanted.

His fiancee is probably stressed about the wedding, so while her comments were absolutely out of line it would probably unfair to for me to criticize her too harshly. It’s not like you’re going to be in EVERY photo, they’ll have countless opportunities to take photos together and with different groups of their friends &amp; wedding parties.

You’re a considerate guy for seeing her side of things, no matter how hurtful her words were. There’s definitey a happy compromise here that allows her to have her photos the way she wants them without outright excluding you. "
321,"It's more like he's my best friend to be honest. I don't think I am his best friend and I can accept that.

I just feel like he also now regrets asking me to be his best man. I have been trying to be positive about this and I think it's best if I stay home to make everyone happy even though I'm pretty torn up about it."
322,"This is not just anxiety, it's full blown delusion. It's dangerous."
323,I think I’m at this point.  Do I need to get a lawyer to do it?
324,Absolutely not. She's a police officer; she should know better. And he should know better than to go along with absurd demands. I'd probably end it too if he can't grasp how weird and inappropriate this is. 
325,Being a father didn’t change how he spent *his* free time. Maybe you should *gently* remind him of that when he’s whining at you. 
326,Yea even the first couple sentences kept that theory alive.

328,"OP, please stop feeling like you owe this man anything. This is some seriously misplaced loyalty. 

Outside of what he is legally entitled to, you owe him nothing. 

If your mother had actually wanted to leave him something, she would have made a will to that effect. She didn't.  What she was saying she wanted him to have was brought about by years of abuse and conditioning. "

331,"""my ex would have my back financially if I fail, I don't feel you would""

lol, terrifying.

Everyone wants to travel, everyone wants to have a nice apartment, everyone wants to live a life not tied to a desk.

She just sees these people doing these things on instagram and expects it should be the same for her. That is the problem with social media, it has all these people in this crazy state of mind (not even realizing that a lot of these social media stars already had family money and didnt need to work in the first place).

My partner started her own business this year...going really well (25k/month with only 5k expenses).

She works Morning. Day. Night, busts her ass to make a good business so she may not have to work someday and hopefully sell it. Your girlfriend doesn't seem to understand what it takes or understands but wants to do what she wants to do.

Bail."
332,"I...Am not quite sure what to say here. This is definitely weird and your mother is and has been hindering your brother’s growth for a very long time, it seems. 

It sounds like their relationship is bordering on incestuous. It’s not normal to do those things with your adult children, let alone anyone aged above a very young child. 

And the adult diaper thing is...Uh...I didn’t wanna be the person to bring this up but, is it possible your mother and brother are doing...weird fetish RP? I mean I guess it might not be a sexual thing to them but...there’s this thing called AB/DL (Adult Baby/Diaper Lover) that’s...basically a community of people who enjoy being babied and put in diapers/babying someone and putting them in diapers.

I could be totally off and maybe I’ve seen a little too much and am just inured by all of the weird shit people do, your brother likely just has a developmental disability and there’s obviously a codependence between him and your mother that is NOT healthy at all. 

...But at the same time, I’d try to figure out whether or not their relationship is of an even more inappropriate nature. 

I wish you the best, OP. But I think if you want to help them you need to focus on your mother and why she keeps enabling this in the first place before the brother. There won’t be any change in him if she doesn’t stop this behavior, and she KNOWS what she’s doing. It’s obvious she wants your brother to be dependent on her as well. Maybe she’s afraid of being alone, but I’d take steps with her before your brother if you decide you think you can help them."
333,Probably should change passwords too. 
334,"It sounds like your mom recognizes a kindred spirit in your ex.  In my experience with a narcissistic mother, boundaries are the only weapon you'll ever have against them.  Make and enforce boundaries.  Then it's up to her to respect those boundaries or face the consequences.  You'll feel much better when she's the one who has to make a choice every time.  When you were a child, there were no consequences (for her) to ignoring your suffering.  Now you are an adult and you can impose consequences and give her the opportunity to do better.  Good luck OP!"
335,No you are 100% right. That’s a HUGE red flag. Don’t be saying she can keep all her earnings and not contribute to the households that’s an absolutely horrible idea. Don’t marry this woman until she gets her crap together and starts contributing to your lives. Go to premarital counselling ASAP 
336,"I dated an identical twin for a couple of years. There was only one instance where I ever mixed them up. They were both wearing red t-shirts and khaki shorts by a coincidence that day, and it was a split second when I wasn't looking directly at them. I just don't buy that a boyfriend would get you mixed up this much."
337,"The problem here is that you are coming to him with a need/concern and he is shutting down/getting angry rather than listening to what you're saying.

It sounds like you two are starting to tumble down a slippery slope of gendered housework splits and resentment, and it has to be addrssed before it does serious damage to your relationship.

I would advise taking a different tact than simply asking for help: I don't think any new combination of words will get him to stop being a selfish ass at this point. Try sending him some reading materiel, such as ""She divorced me because I left dishes by the sink"" and articles on emotional labor and resentment.

If this continues you will resent him (rightfully so!), and he needs to understand that getting angry and telling you that you're wrong instead of working with you to compromise and make both your lives happier is toxic and destructive. You can also suggest marriage counseling, which would be helpful for this communication issue: whatever he says, he's not hearing you. Not really. He's score-keeping, not being empathetic.

This right here says it all, IMO:

&gt;He says I act like he’s never helped around the house before

Oh, so is he done now that he's established he's helped before? /s

He does realize that housework is eternal? That the floors get dirty again? That the bathroom has to be cleaned more than once? That grocery trips happen every week? It's not something he gets to do for a bit and then he's ""done good."" Sending him that reading material will hopefully open his eyes that he doesn't get to have a pat on the back because he's a man and he did some chores at one point."
338,"Guy here.  If you’d otherwise have been up for sex, I think you should tell him and explain why.  If he’s a quality guy he’ll be happy you like him and patient enough to wait until the infection clears.  If he reacts negatively then count yourself lucky you found out early about this part of his personality. 

If you don’t say anything he’s probably going to notice that you’re steering things away from sexual situations and not understand why, he might think it’s him.  Also if you say something he won’t be wondering the whole time whether sex is going to happen and this won’t be disappointed when it doesn’t happen.

"
339,"&gt;I told her this was incredibly inappropriate and upsetting and I got off the call.

For what it's worth, OP, I think this was a really good response. You conveyed your reaction, shut it down, and ended the conversation. Rather than walk on eggshells, that's the way to handle your sister going forward, to the greatest degree possible. You're probably not going to be able to talk her into being a less miserable, negative person. But removing yourself from her pity parties *might* demonstrate that tactic isn't going to get her the attention she's seeking. And even if your sister doesn't learn a lesson, removing yourself and shutting it down means *you* have less of the bad behavior to deal with. "
340,"No, it’s too late. John is dead. Telling his bereaved girlfriend about what happened four years ago is just cruel. 

Clara is absolutely entitled to still have feelings about what happened, but she cannot work them out with Dana. She should go to therapy and deal with it there. "
341,"There have been very similar posts to yours in the past here where the issue was carbon monoxide poisoning, and it’s very serious. Some of your wording reminds me nearly exactly of those posts, especially feeling eyes on you at all times. The “you can just tell” without proof feeling is very classic. It can feel extremely real.

It doesn’t hurt to check as soon as possible; at least you can rule it out then. Good luck.

(ps- I imagine this isn’t what you’d like to hear, but there are several logical fallacies in your post that are causing us to think of this as a possible cause. For example, seeing cars follow you and not having proof they are her but knowing/assuming they have to be. The spam emails are another warning sign, as is the staff member. We’ll be happy to offer advice once you’re sure.)"

347,"&gt;Her reasoning is that our immediate family are relatively taken care for, there are no immediate financial issues, and she wants to see the money go towards something she believes in and can see the immediate results of.

This is incredibly short sighted. It's not a fun thing to think about, but at age 69 she needs to consider the endgame. It's expensive to be old and maintain a good quality of life despite your decreasing capacity to care for yourself. It is very easy to imagine a scenario 15 years down the road where one or both parents are still alive but without the ability to live totally independently, and now they can't afford a nice retirement community because they gave away all their money, so now it's up to you kids to either support them or let them live in a crappy nursing home. It's not fair to anyone to set yourself up for that when it could be avoided. "
348,"OP, I’m really sorry if this comes off harsh but I am finding it really hard to hide my absolute astoundment. I keep thinking this has to be a joke post. 

Are *you* ok? Because explaining all this away has to take extreme denial or your own set of mental issues. You have a man stalking a woman and then acting it out with you in bed, stealing from the homeless, and sabotaging friends livelihood... and you’re not seeming to be as concerned as you should be. You’re more afraid to admit you snooped than to confront your husband with his stalking. I just... what?

You have a husband who is *obsessed* with a peeping kink to the point he is staying up until 4 AM to masturbate to it, and a camera full of candid creep shots of a single woman and you’re worried about an affair? You are so far off the mark. A normal person would gather a copy of the evidence, confront their husband, and either get them help or turn them in if they refuse. 
This poor woman is in DANGER. He came home covered in bruises. Did he get assaulted by a homeless person he tried to steal from, or from a potential kidnapping victim? Like, holy shit, who even knows since he is so messed up. 

And your poor friend. And you’re just like, “what do I even say to my husband?” How about, “hey, you’re clearly either a sociopath or having a neurotic episode, so let’s get you help.” 

I swear your husband is going to end up on the news and you’re going to act shocked. “How was he capable of this?” He left a damn trail of flash flair breadcrumbs. Red flags are so far behind you. This is serious. 

You need to talk to someone. Have someone with you when you confront your husband, someone you trust to deescalate just in case. Let your husband know he can get help or you can turn the photos over to the police along with an account of his behaviours.  

Don’t turn a blind eye to this and enable whatever he’s capable of doing next. Honestly, OP. "
349,"Honestly, just tell him exactly what you said here.  Nothing wrong with what you want, and if he's a good BF like you make him sound, he'll get it.  If he doesn't get it, then maybe he's not as good as he seems after all.  "
350,It’s truly bizarre. Why is he so deeply suspicious? 
351,Bet you $100 she's worried this means you won't want to live together in the future. 
352,You are a reminder that her boyfriend had a family before her. 
353,"You're the rebound.

""I heard you crying to your sister about your ex. I think you're too hung up on him to be dating me."""
354,I know exactly what he means
355,"In your first post, you mention that your bf is smarter than you. Please don’t sell yourself short in the future. Yes he got that job but there’s a lot of random factors when it comes to any position. Plus having an impressive resume in college isn’t the same as being a good worker. I’ve had two bfs  who were pretty open about thinking they were smarter, but in hindsight I don’t think that’s objectively true. The first had a lower gpa than me at graduation and the second had very good grades but only lasted a year at his extremely competitive law firm position he bragged so much about getting during his last year of law school.

Ten years from now you might be more successful than him. Not that it’s everything in life but still.

ETA: date people who think you’re smart, funny, cool etc. and make you feel good about yourself, not trumpet their own achievements but look down on yours."
356,"Oh man!  Didn't we all have those kinds of crushes as young teens?  Just get your husband to write her a nice letter back saying ""thanks for your note and I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not Luis Fonsi.  If you like, I will keep this a secret till death.  I wish you well and hope you get to meet Luis Fonsi some day!""  I think that would let her down nicely and not put her on the spot by doing it in person."
357,"This advice makes the most sense to me. Talking to her about her behavior only makes sense if op wants to stay friends with her. However, I think that not responding to her will be the only thing that will actually make her stop."
358,"I used to respond to compliments with negating comments, too.

Eventually I learned that this habit made it hard for people to talk to me with sincerity. I casually (defensively) treated them like liars when they genuinely appreciated something about me, and allowed my own self hatred to prevent me from acknowledging the gift in their compliments.

(You'll note that rejecting your brother's invitation to participate in the wedding is also treating him like he's a liar to have said he wants you there. Do you really want to make an assumption that slanders him in this way?)

For future reference, the best response to a compliment (even one based on incomplete information) is, ""Thank you!""

Don't knock yourself to other people. They will be happy to see the best in you, and this does you no harm. It may even be good for you!

Usually, people feel happy when you treat them like their appreciation toward you is meaningful. Accepting compliments is a kindness in return."
359,"As they are in your room now and you’re caring for them daily you have assumed some level of responsibility in this situation. You need to rehome these animals. Sounds like you have no interest in keeping them and I’m not sure how much you know about their needs so here is some advice that can improve their welfare while you find a better home. 

Continue to keep males and females separated. They should be spayed/neutered but if he bought them it’s likely they’re not. You will multiply your problem with a pregnancy. Make sure you note the possibility of pregnancy to whomever is taking them. 

The biting on the bars is likely from lack of space, stimulation and materials to bite on. Guineas need to keep their teeth work down as they grow. Give them some cardboard tubes/boxes to play with and suitable clean wood to gnaw on as well as places to hide. 

If you are getting bitten and scratched when trying to remove them for cleaning it sounds like these guys are not used to handling and are very scared. Guineas are prey animals and their instinct is to hide. Try putting something dark and cosy like a box in the cage, luring them in with kale and lifting them out that way. 

Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to feed and change water daily, you probably don’t forget like your brother but it’s always worth having a reminder. Guinea pigs should have lots of Timothy hay and should be fed pellets. Veggies alone won’t cut it. 

The rehoming: try and surrender them to a local humane society or SPCA. It sounds like these guys might need a bit of socialization if your brother hasn’t been interacting with them, and if one of them IS pregnant, that would be a better place to deal with unwanted litters. If that’s not a possibility, don’t sell them, they deserve to go to the best home possible and that’s not always the case when animals are sold online and in stores. You obviously care for these guys and don’t want them to end up in another situation where someone will forget to give them food and water and they will not have their social or spacial needs met. Post on local animal welfare or small animal interest groups and Facebook pages. 

All of this should be done without your brothers input. It seems that he had absolved himself of all responsibility towards them. As far as him getting violent, that’s up to you and your family to deal with. He is 24, a fully grown man and those who abuse animals are not far from abusing humans. Sorry you have to deal with him. These animals don’t have a voice, well done for speaking up for them, good luck with the situation. 

"
360,"Yes, thank you! Nearly every time I was broken up with by a guy I was left with a little bit of hope. Sometimes, a lot of hope. 

OP, this guy's advice is perfect."
361,"My bf at 21 said the EXACT same thing when I would express similar concerns. “why should I do something I don’t want to do.” 

It drove me crazy. He turned out to be a nightmare emotional abuser but that’s another story. with time and maturity (I’m now 31) I realize that those words were his way of saying he didn’t really want to be in a relationship. Or at least the type of relationship I wanted that included a level of commitment and compromise from both parties.

If he’s not compromising now, he won’t in the future. You’re sooooo young. Unless you want to live a relationship entirely on his term, break up with this guy who clearly doesn’t know how be in an adult yet. "
362,WTF are you doing with that jerk?
363,"The obsession with morgelons isn't depression. I'm familiar with this, half those people think the fibers are alien implants. If he thinks its government technology he is losing his grip on reality. Besides that hes completely given up on life. Not working is not acceptable especially when it doesnt sound like he keeps up with house work. I normally dont agree with ultimatums but you need to tell him its therapy or the road. You shouldnt spend your life with someone who contributes nothing. Thats what Id say if you were my sister."
364,"I don't think you're doing him any favors in the long run staying in this relationship with him. He needs to learn that his actions have consequences and that you can't blithely do stuff like go through people's bathroom trash and dirty laundry and make crazy accusations and read people's private journals. He needs to work on himself, and if you just accept this and hug him and comfort him when he behaves like this, you're training him to keep acting this way. He is rewarded with affection. 

I think you're ""putting yourself aside for a moment"" too much in this relationship. I know you love him, but is this any way to live? 

Sorry. "
365,"I would consider that to be inappropriate.  It’s one thing for it to be a professional photographer you don’t know, but things can’t be kept completely professional when it’s your friend. "
366,"Your parent has been coming to terms with her transition for a long time, and you’ve only had a couple months to start processing what is happening. Let her know this. Also emphasize that you are supportive and trying your best to see her in a new light - but that means you’ll ave to stop seeing her as she’s been to you for the last 21 years, and it will take time. Let her know that you’ll make mistakes along the way, but that you’re doing your best and you love her. I would also ask her to talk to her boyfriend so that when corrections do come, they only come from your parent. It’s her place to navigate this new territory with you, not her boyfriend’s.

374,"There's a good chance that if you continue in therapy you'll swing back to a middle ground between this self and your old one. It sounds like you're not yet at a good spot to stay long term, but you'll find that balance once you work through past issues. You're feeling lots of emotions right now because of feeling things you've once suppressed, but you want to end up at a spot where you're managing your emotions, not letting them control you or constantly venting them (for anger venting actually increases the feeling), not suppressing them, but acknowledging them, expressing them while still in control, then acting on them. 

So I'd actually bring this up with your therapist, but also keep the lines of communication open with your boyfriend. He may need to take time to adjust, too."
375,And many sessions. Does he plan on making multiple trips to Brazil or just moving back there for however long it takes to get it done?

377,"This is really tough, and I don’t envy your situation.

I believe her that she genuinely is sorry and regrets the whole thing. But, I also understand why she did that. Sometimes, shit just happens.

That said, there was a breach of trust - perceived or real - on both of your ends, and there was genuine hurt. This has and will continue to affect you both. 

If I were in your shoes, I would have a talk with her. I would say that if she wants go to to all of the people she told and explain to them exactly what happened - the doctor gave a false positive, what she said wasn’t true, you’ve been faithful, and she was wrong - then you are willing to forgive and move forward, on the understanding that she builds trust with you. Not going to lie, this is a difficult and big step, and I’m not sure it will happen.

You didn’t do anything wrong. But I would DEFINITELY take some time to let all of the dust settle and things cool down on this. Everybody needs to just take a deep breath and calm down from all of this, and I highly recommend taking some time for yourself.

Really what I see: this is such a jarring and difficult circumstance, even if you did nothing wrong, sometimes shit just happens, and you break up, over a misunderstanding. That happened to me. Tl;dr is i was with my fiancée, we talked about me (then 27m) getting snipped but maybe adopting kids in the future. After the procedure she then realized that she did in fact want her own kids. And so we split. I didn’t do anything wrong, yet shit happens, and we move on. There was no rectifying that situation. 

Maybe you two can work it out, maybe not... but this was a very real and jarring circumstance, and emotions were high. By all means I’d you want to work it out go ahead and try.

But do NOT feel bad if you end up saying “I think we just need some time apart to let the dust settle and see how we feel about things.”"
378,"Because when people are being stalked their story us generally more straightforward. ""They came into my work today and stared at me. They knocked on my door and shouted abuse through the letterbox. They called me 51 times yesterday.""

Your story means that she owns multiple cars, and uses them for a 8 hour commute everyday to her place of work. How could she possibly do that? "
379,"You didn’t go because ultimately, she didn’t want you to go. Now that she’s back after getting her way, she’s enjoying the relationship status quo again. The only thing that has made her feel better about your relationship or has made her feel like it’s stronger is the fact that you put up with this without telling her she needs to make a clear decision or that she’s full of crap. 

Whether or not this is a relationship game changer for you is your own, personal decision. However, I would have trouble continuing with a person who so easily takes advantage of me."
380,"So here’s the thing: he didn’t have a slip-up. He didn’t drink too much and kiss someone, or allow a workplace flirtation to go too far. 

He took many, many steps to cheat on you - the alternate email account, seeking out other women to talk to, searching out escorts, making, keeping, attending the “appointments” - more than once, and to me most importantly, he didn’t confess any of this to you - you found out. He says he felt remorseful, but that remorse didn’t cause him to stop - or to tell you. He would have kept doing it as long as he wasn’t caught. How do I know that? Because he kept doing it until he was caught. 

I also can’t help but notice that all these feelings of inadequacy and feeling he’s a terrible person didn’t come up until he was caught. That’s sort of....convenient, isn’t it? Why wasn’t this something he was discussing with his wife, his life partner? Getting a handie from a stranger was supposed to make him feel like less of a shitty person? GTFOH with that. 

I tried to give a cheater another chance once. Every time he left the house, I wondered. Every text he sent or received, I wondered. Every time I didn’t hear from him for a few hours, because there was supposedly no service or he didn’t have his phone, I wondered. 

I didn’t want to wonder anymore. It’s a super shitty feeling. I didn’t want to keep feeling crazy because I doubted someone that in fact, had no integrity. 

I’m so sorry you discovered this while you’re pregnant. But that doesn’t change what he’s done - and who he is.  And that isn’t who you thought he was. "

405,"Sounds like David's been kind of the ""missing stair"" of your friend group for a while now. I used to be friends (even roommates for a while) with a guy like that back in college (I don't think he ever sent dick pics specifically but lots of other similar shit). At the time I was full of excuses for how he's not all bad, you just have to get to know him, he doesn't realize how he comes off, he didn't mean it like that, yadda yadda yadda. It took him betraying and hurting me in a really profound way for me to finally get it: he couldn't be trusted and he didn't care who he hurt. 

Now I look back with a lot of shame for normalizing his behavior for so long. There's girls I used to know who I feel like I let down, by basically being complicit with this guy's bad behavior. By minimizing it because it would be too complex and difficult for me to face. And because I was young and I didn't see how all the little actions that pushed boundaries here and there added up to a bigger picture of toxicity. 

Don't just focus on how hard it would be to find a new roommate now. Think about what you will think looking back on this later. I'm not saying you have to kick him out and cut him off--some people have suggested confronting him about his behavior and trying to get him to change, which I am skeptical of but you can always try. I'm just saying, he's not the only person who could be your roommate. Your bf will survive working with him if they aren't still friends. Think about what actions you can reflect on without too much regret. "
406,"It might not be jealousy. You don’t get to 280 plus pounds and have a normal relationship with food. It’s possible she genuinely thinks OP isn’t eating enough.

408,"Honestly, his responses about the candles sound like saving face. Most people don’t casually light candles in otherwise dark rooms when other people are coming over without realizing how that might look. It sounds like very obvious BS.

I would be cautious, as many other people have said, especially because of his fixation on how you’re Japanese. I’m sure you know the usual gross stereotypes some people ascribe to Japanese women, especially people who enjoy anime enough to project it up onto a wall with a Japanese neighbor they only just met that day. I hate saying it, but it’s not unlikely he has those ideas - especially since you said you don’t know him well.

This update makes him sound more fishy, not less. Good luck.

PS: He hasn’t spoke to you in a year, but he bought you an “asian themed” gift based on overhearing you cough (without speaking to you), asked you for Japanese language lessons, invited you to dinner, and then invited you into his darkened apartment to watch Japanese anime. All within the first few hours of speaking to you *for the first time in over a year.* These are not the actions of someone only interested in a normal friendship."
409,"I would not know how to drive if I hadn't taken Driver's Ed in school.  My mother and step father both tried to teach me and they were both absolutely horrible at teaching me how to drive.

410,"They're the ones causing this.  They're letting a demented old man's long ruminating slight poison their relationship with their sister, when they should be using this as an opportunity to bring their family back together now that the one with the problem is dead.

More than likely, this is all due to money.  They don't want you mom to try to stake any claim on the property they hope to get their own hands on.  ""Disrespectful to his property"" is a load of manure.  They're greedy and disguising it to try to make it sound better."
411,"You broke a promise to your girlfriend and she dumped you. The relationship is over. 

I'm not sure what you're looking for here. "
412,"Unfortunately, when someone doesn't respond, you often never find out why. Maybe he wasn't interested, or maybe he's just very insecure and terrified. (It does sound like he is at least a little insecure, based off of his comments to your coworker, but also sweet, in that he made a point to go change out of his work clothes for you.) I don't have a good answer for how to proceed, but I would suggest giving him a little bit more time and if you do see him or hear from him, and you're happy to hear from him, just be happy. You don't ""need"" to react in a certain way just because he didn't get back to you in X amount of time. It's your choice.

But at some point, if he doesn't get back to you, you'll of course need to move on. Exactly when that point is, is up to you. If you move on and he saunters in to your store six months from now, you can decide what to do then. But I wouldn't burn any emotional energy waiting for that to happen."
413,"You've been pursuing your career for YEARS, you've been dating him for 10 months. Your are not selfish at all, this is something you've worked hard for. Medical school is no freaking joke, he needs to understand that that is your priority.

414,Honestly it sounds like he ghosted you. That it's done. 
415,"The fact that he went and told people without telling you is a serious red flag, OP. It's manipulative, at best.

He can be as happy as he wants, but this is not an area he just gets to run as he wants.

418,"He and his friends all sound disgusting. Even if he's not physically violent with you, he's still abusive and disrespectful.

I would just tell him it's over and walk; don't even get into an argument with him where he can make excuses for his behavior or make you seem irrational. 

Don't ever let scum like this guy make you think of yourself as damaged goods. Best of luck!"
419,"My sister doesn’t actually know about the abuse.  When he started being physically abusive, I called the cops and put him in jail.  She knew about this at least somewhat and when I went to talk to her about it she said she didn’t want to know and wanted to stay out of it.  

The sexual abuse part is weird too.  He never touched me.  He would stand in my room while I was sleeping and jerk off.  It’s all really hazy and I blocked it all out until about a decade after it happened.  "
420,"Honestly, when I was 18 I didn't really know how to get myself off with a partner. If they constantly asked me what I needed I'd panic inside because I had no idea what to tell them. I mean I knew what felt good alone, but being with a partner is incredibly different. Explaining it was harder then you'd think too. It took a lot of years to just go with it and figure it out, but even in my 20's I could never get off with a new partner right away. Now I'm happily married with a really patient man, and not always is it easy to get off still.

I need toys to get off, and it took some experimenting before I could find the right one and the right spot to use it on. Don't push her. Just be patient and loving, let her be comfortable in touching herself too during sex. That's huge! The other thing is she needs to learn that her pleasure isn't totally on the man, it's up to both of you to work at it and find your groove."
421,"&gt;I almost feel like I’m mourning my Dad

You *are*. Your Dad is transforming his/her entire identity. The person whom you remember as your Dad no longer really exists. And it's really fucking hard to adjust to.

I haven't had a parent transition, but my first boyfriend did. We had been broken up for a few years, but were still close, and seeing her transition into a woman was much harder than I expected, even though I was supportive. It was hard to see the person, the boy, I had remembered being erased piece by piece, and it *especially* hurt when the new person (I'll call her Charli to avoid confusion) told me, ""That person you remember never existed. They were a persona I invented to fit in. This is the real me.""  It felt less like a change, and almost like a complete erasure of what was a really important part of my past. Apparently, my first relationship and all the memories with it were fake, and the person I had loved had never existed. It messed me up for years.

Ultimately, I had to cut contact with Charli. Not because she's trans or because I have any issue with her being a woman, but because her journey into becoming the person she wants to be and feels she truly is, by its very nature, is pulling her away from me. Our close friendship was founded on our past together - how could that foundation survive when Charli decided that her past was all lies?

Similarly, your Dad is trying to shed their past identity as a man, or as a father. But how can they do that without also shedding their relationship with you, the child they fathered?

Your relationship with this person has changed, especially if they no longer feel comfortable being called or identified as Dad. It's okay to take some space away from them to process this, and to truly mourn what you've lost. ""Dad"" might be thrilled that they can now embrace their identity as a woman, but it's unfair for them to expect you to be jumping for joy also when this means you are losing the father you remember. Without meaning to, their gain is a loss for you, whether they want to acknowledge it or not. Even though you're both adults and can relate as adults, the foundation of your relationship was father/~~son~~ daughter (my mistake!). If that relationship is no longer viable, then you need to build a new one from scratch, and that takes time. Especially when you move through all the states of grieving.

I would recommend counselling for you, so you can have someone help you grieve for a person who is still alive. If your Dad is willing, maybe you could have joint counselling as well so you have a neutral third-party help you find a way to have a relationship together whilst also dealing with your internal conflicting drives (ie, you missing the person you remember as Dad, whilst they are trying to shed that part of their identity).

But yeah, this shit takes time and space. Lots of it."

423,"People have given you good scripts for talking to her, but I don't believe you need to talk to her at all. Where is your roommate in all this? It's his responsibility to tell her no, now that you've made your position clear. Ask him to intervene.

""Dude, your girlfriend is stressing me out. She can't move in, and we agreed on that from the beginning. Can you talk to her and get her to back off?""

Also, if she's around all the time, now might be a great time to talk to him about limiting how much she's allowed over. 

Other than that, when she harasses you and roommate doesn't step in, shut it down in simple, straightforward terms. 

""It's not happening, drop it.""

""It doesn't matter what you think, you're not going to live here.""

""Talking about this isn't going to change anything.""

""You need to stop talking about this or you won't be welcome to visit here anymore.""

""I'm not dealing with this. Roommate, can you step in please?""

He lost his partner of over 20 years. That's a hell of a hole to have in your life. He can't have your mum back, and the rellationships he has now don't have to follow the model him and your mum chose. 

Him getting married now doesn't give this relationship more legitimacy than the one he had with your mum, and it doesn't give his relationship with her child more legitimacy than the one he has with you. It's also entirely possible that having to go through the legalities of his partner dying without them being married is what's got him to do it this time.

431,"&gt;He was drunk and obviously on edge, being sarcastic. I raised my voice a little and told him he should at least tell me if he's coming home late, and to keep it down. He went to grab my arm (non aggressively) and I pulled it back quickly. Anyway, it's a bit of a blur but he ended up grabbing me by my hair with his other hand on my neck and squeezing.

This is your description of what happened. I don't see ""uncontrollable anger"" here. He was home drunk, sarcastic and in a shitty mood. You tried to reason with him to keep it down, and he tried to grab your arm but you dodged. At that point, he snapped and attacked you. 

His issues are deeper than anger &amp; alcohol. At the moment he attacked you, he wanted to control you. He didn't want you to come out and shush him... he didn't want you to raise your voice... he didn't want to be told what to do. And when you dodged him, that was the last straw, you see. 

You defied him. At every step, you weren't the placating, silent, 110% supportive wife, and that's why he hurt you. 

This book is mentioned a lot, but *Why Does He Do That* offers valuable insight to controlling and abusive men. It's available free online as a pdf. 

Also, seriously, he needs to contact his therapist for a referral to a ""batterer intervention program"", not anger management."
432,"My mom used to fly off the handle and treat me like I was a terrible kid when I was doing normal things, not even drinking or drugs like your grandkid, and guess what?

You don't really have any recourse here, but I will say definitely make sure that he knows you're there for him. Cause somethings tells me your daughter is about to have another estranged relationship on her hands if she goes through with this nonsense. "
433,"My mom is in a wheelchair with a lot of medical equipment attached and you can bet your ass she's in all my wedding pictures, front and center. I would have been heartbroken not to have her there.

Please OP, talk to your brother about this. If he's the kind of guy you say he is it would rip him apart to know you were thinking of not going, and that he'd miss having you as part of this big moment.

436,"I'm sorry about your mother (and this may sound harsh but) stop trying to have a relationship with a narcissist. As much as it hurts, you need to let the idea of having a relationship with her go. A 40 minute voicemail calling you names and threatening you is abusive and it's bullshit. Her being your blood mother does not mean you HAVE to have a relationship with her, especially if she behaves this way.

Just tell her ""I do not want to get matching tattoos."" 

That's it. No is a complete sentence. And start saving up money to move out away from her.  If you're this afraid of her, you need to get out ASAP.  Can you stay with your Uncle? Can you say with a friend? Because this environment is not healthy or good for you. "
437,"This is really freaking scary.

My advice changes a bit depending on if you’ve already talked to Nate about Greg or not. If one of the personal things you’ve shared with Nate is about Greg stalking you, then unfortunately I think you should cut ties with Nate for your own safety. If he’s knowingly helping Greg, then he’s putting you in danger.

However, if you haven’t talked to Nick about this at any point, now is the time. Greg seems super manipulative, and it’s possible that Nick genuinely believes that he’s helping you reconnect with an old friend. Tell Nick exactly what you’ve written here- that you met up with Greg, that Greg’s escalated and is scaring you, and that you saw the message from Greg. Ask him what their contact has been like, what Greg has told Nick, and what Nick said about you. This is a one time conversation that you should *only* have if you two haven’t talked about Greg before. If *at any time* Nick expresses reluctance about cutting Greg off or tries to downplay your experiences, then you cannot keep hanging out with him. You aren’t safe with Greg, and you aren’t safe with anyone who will help Greg.

Also, look into getting a restraining order. Keep a paper trail. I’m scared for you."

It’s unfortunate he is getting evicted, but there is surely a reason for that that has nothing to do with you. 

It’s too bad that his life isn’t panning out the way he wanted, but he needs to take action. 

He is a 40-year-old man. He survived before you and he’ll survive after you. Stop trying to save him. "

445,"Don’t beat yourself about it. I don’t even like going up on stage to receive awards, ill never had a wedding because being the centre of attention terrifies me. 

It’s kind of ridiculous that she’s mad that she didn’t get a shout out in front of a groupe of people and their families that shell probably never see again. But now I’ll bet they’ll remember her for a while! 

Also, that family thing was a low blow. Cancelling vacations can be expensive. "
446,I felt exhausted just reading that. I hope you're okay.
447,"Exactly.  He knows what he is doing is wrong, or he wouldn’t feel the need to push back as strongly as he does when OP questioned the behavior.

It’s all fine and dandy if the dude can’t handle monogamy, but not if he wants the perks of monogamy while living polyamorously.  That just makes him a selfish douche."
448,He doesn't need to understand. He just needs to respect the fact that OP doesn't want a relationship with her mom because she was abused. 
449,"At this point I would suggest finding someone else to teach you, OP. While driving isn’t particularly difficult once you get the hang of it, it is a big responsibility, and as was mentioned above, you do need to be focussed on the road and your surroundings. 

Being in a comfortable environment (i.e. not with your dad who will stress you out while teaching you) will go a long way in learning. Find someone who will take you to an empty parking lot and show you the basics, and try to get yourself comfortable with how a car drives.

Once you get some confidence and have been doing it long enough, a lot of it becomes second nature. 

Be responsible about it, but don’t be afraid to get out there and learn!"
450,"Go directly to the head teacher/ principal. Personal belief systems have no place in your child’s education, especially after making it clear that this is not okay. This is something that needs to be dealt with by her boss immediately. "
451,"No, you’re not being overbearing. Calmly tell her how you feel and how when you did it, she disapproved and hopefully, she understands. "
452,This dog is showing classic signs of being bored as fuck. He needs (serious) exercise and stimulation. Two walks a day clearly isn't cutting it.
453,"You can choose to have facial hair if you wish. She can choose whether she wants to be in a relationship with you. 

"
454,"Your boyfriend seems to have the same moral code as his friends... So who are you really disgusted by here? 

Honestly from the small town I live in, this is super common. If you don't like it though, you just stop being around those people."
455,"Remember, these people aren't asking because they *really* want to know exactly what your top three bands are. They're asking because they want to get to know you, and keep the conversation going. So it's totally fair to say, ""I actually prefer audiobooks, at the moment I'm listening to..."" 

But honestly, don't feel that pop is ""uncool"" or that you have to mention ""good bands"". It's okay to say, ""Actually, I find I can't stop listening to Uptown Funk. I can't help it, it's so catchy!"" Music isn't meant to be used to demonstrate ""cool creds"", though some people treat it as such. Own what you like. "
456,"Fair enough, for me it depends on the excuse. Three times and it’s pretty much a delete contact and move on, and I tell them so upon the second cancellation. 

My ex boyfriends mother had terrible migraines, so I can sympathise with her here. But that excuse for the third cancellation was just depressingly pathetic imo. She’s pissing on him and not even doing him the courtesy of calling it rain. "
457,"Don’t just say that it happened. When he says he wants to break up, you say “ok, I respect your decision. I can’t force you to believe me. I will get my stuff out by this weekend.” 

He wants groveling. Do not grovel. And do not negotiate with someone who straight up doesn’t trust you for no reason. 

Then he will weirdly back out of the break up and you will realize he was just manipulating you because of his own issues and you will need to have a conversation about that part. 

Edit: wait... did this happen 3 years ago? "
458,"Date a grownup?

Seriously though, his insecurities are just that. HIS. His to work on, his to deal with, his to get over. Not yours. You start giving in to his insecurities now and it will never stop because there will always be something else. Got a friend who is better looking? You'll have to cut him off. Dude makes more money than your boyfriend? He'll have to go too.

This is a slippery slope and he is being ridiculous. Give in now and he will never do the work he needs to do to deal with all of this on his own as grownups should. Tell him you love him and his body, but he has to get to a place of acceptance on his own because he's being very superficial about this. You can't do it for him."
459,"So during an extremely difficult time in your life when you were in desperate need of support, this so-called friend not only abandoned you, but then proceeded to pal around with an abusive ex in the aftermath? 

I'm dead serious here; WHY are you still calling her your friend?

"
460,"Report the car as stolen and report the illegal eviction. 

Go to r/legaladvice and get advice on the legal process to follow where you are.

From a relationships perspective you need to stop letting her walk all over you. This is insane. Stop giving her money. Call the police when she breaks the law. She will not stop until there are actual consequences for her actions. "
461,"Dude didn't mention he stayed at your neighbours house and talked? That's weird in itself.



Him losing his phone and not mentioning it might be with the chick he was apparently with all night is even weirder. 


Yea that's pretty shifty. "

464,"If I were in your wife's shoes, I would do the same thing! I am fiercely defensive of my husband, and would not be okay with anyone, including my family, behaving this way. 

If these individuals want to come to you and apologize on their own accord, then let them. It is your choice whether you forgive them or not.

I think the best you can do is be supportive of her if she does mentioning re-opening up some relationships. Just take it day by day and don't worry too much! Also, maybe she should join you for a counseling session? That way she might feel ""safer"" opening up about what she feels deep down. I'm sure she is ashamed these people acted this way, but also feels a lot of guilt over both their behavior, and her reaction to it.

Remind her you love her and appreciate her support. And tell her if she needs you, you are there!"

468,"I definitely agree with the people saying you need to talk to a lawyer, but if you want to get out of giving him any money, you could take the 1/3 that you said you would give to him and instead donate it to an organization that helps survivors of child abuse. That way no one can accuse you of being greedy, and it’s a satisfying mix of doing a good deed and saying “fuck you” to the man who abused you and your family. 

Edit: wording"
469,"I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. 
I know we're only strangers pressuring you, but I sincerely hope you reconsider and do go to the wedding and be the best man. 
You can come to my wedding and be in my dang pictures. "
470,Yea it sounds like the rumor mill started spreading allegations of sexual assault/harassment or violence maybe? It’s really sad (and upsetting even to me!) that these people in OP’s life just threw him out like this. Completely ludicrous. 
471,"I'm not saying your fears are unfounded, but how would she know what school your job was sending you to, and how would she immediately get a job there? And please don't take this the wrong way, but are suffering from any new mental health issues, or have you recently started a new medication, or have you gone through a recent stressful life event?"
472,"Break up. If she wants a house and kids, she probably has less than 10 years to get that going. Let her move on and find someone who wants that with her."

474,"Minister here.

I will not speak in terms of ""right"" and ""wrong"" in regard to your question, because every person will have a different perspective on those.  What I *will* do is speak to you from experience about what I have seen make couples *successful*.

It is ""OK"" and ""right"" to get married when:

1. The two of you are, individually, fully certain of your own personal identities; in general, I recommend that people spend at *least* a year of their adult lives living alone (or as close to alone as is financially practical, but in any even in a situation where they are not living with someone they are emotionally dependent upon).  The reason for this is simple:  until you know who you are when you do not have to make compromises in order to live with another person, you will not be fully aware of the compromises that you *are* making when you *do* live with someone; it's OK and good to make compromises to live with another person, but it's wise to be sure that you are aware of exactly what you are giving up.  So many of us go from living with parents to living with boyfriends or girlfriends to living with spouses that we never know who we are *when no one else is around*.  Myself included; I had never lived alone a day in my life until I was 28. I learned so much about myself during the year I was alone that, even though it was challenging, I wouldn't give it up for anything.

2. The two of you are capable of living without support from anyone outside; you need to be able to pay your own bills, housing, food...everything.

3. You need to, as a couple, be able to talk about *anything*.  There must be no subjects that are too hard, too awkward, too icky, or too scary to discuss.  Because it's those places that problems arise, and if you cannot talk about them, you cannot resolve them.

4. You need each to be able to stand on your own, emotionally, so that (even though you support one another in times of trouble) neither of you becomes a crutch for the other.

5. You need to have a relationship that is so special, so wonderful, so valuable to both of you, that you are willing to step before one another, friends, family, the law, and (if you are religious) the Infinite Divine as you perceive it, and declare ""We love this relationship *as it is* so much that we promise to do everything we can to make sure that it stays this good for as long as we live.

Can a couple have a successful marriage without meeting all of these?  Sure.   But the couples that have the easiest time of doing so, who have the most satisfactory lives together, and who really are *happy* to be married to one another...they're the ones who did all of these things.

I've performed weddings for more couples than I can even remember, over the past decade and more, and this is what I *know*."
475,Read as bucket of carbs. 
476,"Dude even if you DID want to keep the kid, him telling all his friends and family about it less than a month into the pregnancy shows poor judgment. Generally this is something you announce to friends and family AS A COUPLE, when you are both sure you are ready to tell people. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you aren't ready, terminate the pregnancy. Your boyfriend can tell his friends/family that it was a false positive, that the pregnancy wasn't viable, or whatever the fuck he wants to tell them. He's the one that put his foot in his mouth here, let him deal with the repercussions."
477,"&gt; is something he’s actively working on 

How is he working on it? Because it seems like if he were making progress you wouldn't be making this post."
478,"I’d gamble that he has not stopped his porn addiction. Sorry, but that is one of the simplest conclusions and although it could be other things, it seems the most glaringly obvious thing to consider. "
479,"Tell him you *did* ask God and God is telling you to seek medical care. Checkmate, motherfucker. "
480,"Well, she wants to live in your home. And she's comfortable with bullying you to get what she wants. You need to make some decisions here."
481,"Frankly, both women sound horrible and you sound incredibly passive. You married your wife yet you allow your ex to keep her out of your son's Life?  How involved are you as a father? Why does your son not spend time in your home, with your wife? I can see why your wife is bitter and she's not bitter at the ex, she's bitter at *you*. This is why all hell has broken loose. Because she feels you're being a doormat to your ex and you are fine and dandy with her being kept separate from a huge part of your life, namely your child. You need to rethink your stance towards your ex and you should consider counseling if you want to save your marriage. Facebook is the least of your concerns if your own child is not allowed to meet your life partner and you tolerate it. "
482,"The guy is throwing up enough red flags a bull would have killed him by now. I don’t get all the people who want to beat around the bush on this. He’s acting suspicious and hiding things. People don’t hide innocent things.

When the baby is asleep I would calmly ask him to join you in the kitchen, sit opposite each other at the table. When he sits down, ask to see his phone. If he asks why, you can tell him you know he is hiding something. You can read off a list of moments where you’ve caught him acting suspicious. 

If he refuses, you can calmly tell him that if he’s cheating on you, there’s the door and he can get out right now. Tell him that if he hands over the phone and something is going on, he has to end it. If he doesn’t, there’s the door. And you’ll tell everyone in your circle and his parents that he’s cheating on you. 

If he has nothing to hide, he will hand over his phone. If he doesn’t want to lose his marriage, he will hand over his phone. If he has something he wants to hide that he doesn’t want to give up, he won’t hand over his phone. And that will tell you everything. 

I had a friend in the same situation and her husband was cheating on her during her pregnancy. Then it came out he had been cheating on her for years with lots of women. His friends knew but never told her. He tried to gaslight her. Don’t let him gaslight you. "
483,All her documents are already with me. Everything is ready we're just waiting for her 18th birthday. 
484,"Go without him.  Start doing more stuff without him, if they don't ""factually make sense.""  Good lord does he sound miserable.  "
485,"I'd be a little worried that your boyfriend wouldn't care if his friends kept hitting on you or even if they were a little more aggressive.

Of course, everyone's different and some don't mind when exes pass each other around in a friend's group, but I learned a long time ago to not associate with that kind of friends group because it doesn't make me happy. There is way too much drama, it's uncomfortable, you never get a break from the people who are hitting on you, they tend to talk about their experiences together (especially after drinking or smoking) as if though you're not in the room, and you don't know who is genuine and trying to be a good friend. It's exhausting."
486,r/relationships: here to help with all your jerk problems
487,"holy shit yessssss.  From your first post it was *possible* he was just excited about his job and oblivious, but the way he responded to your really reasonable comment that he was hurting your feelings and being a bit of an ass makes it CLEAR that he's not relationship material.  Way to advocate for yourself."
488,That's the funniest fucking thing I've heard all day. If my wife said this to me I'd die laughing. 
489,"Ugh, when I was young (around 21) I dated a guy who was a little older (29), and I was really attracted to him because he was so freaking sweet. He had a reputation for being a really great guy, well respected by everybody. But he kind of preyed on my insecurities (I had just gotten out of a long relationship and was feeling down on myself), and just took jabs at me all the time. It hurt extra, knowing that he was fully capable of being super sweet to everyone around us. In public he was very doting and loving to me, but in private he could be so hurtful. The only times he would turn it around and be super sweet to me was when I was in the middle of trying to break up with him, or when we were taking a break and he wanted to get in my pants. I should have known to just ditch him, but it took me a good two years to get my head on straight and leave for good. My advice is to do the same."
490,"The “I birthed you and took care of you” is such an eye roller... Of course she did, you were a child incapable of caring for yourself that she chose to have. She’s a capable adult, and you didn’t choose this life for her.

Tell her no and don’t give it a second thought."
491,Pretend it didn't happen and move on. I'm betting she'll also do the same 
492,"Your husband is right - you need to go see a therapist. Being this panicked about a job (that, in your own words, is inherently fine) is absolutely not the norm.

Is there work you’d rather be doing? Art teacher? Music tutor, etc?"
493,"Sounds like you let everyone take care of you, and claim toxic when they start asking for some help. No adult should only be spending money on themselves while everyone else pays for everything. Being an adult is sometimes not being able to spoil yourself. Being an adult is helping with bills and groceries and chores. Would be interesting to get all sides of the story here. "
494,"I would step away from the Reddit hate train and evaluate how your new found knowledge makes you feel about your GF after you've taken a few days to reflect on it. 

My take is that she hid it because she thought it was shameful but likely doesn't regret it because it was obviously a meaningful relationship to her that contributed to the person she is today. So who is that person and how do they feel about the importance of vows and fidelity? This is what you need to clarify through discussion and evaluation of her behavior in your relationship. We can only make assumptions about it based on what you told us but people can grow up and change, especially from their early to late 20's. Also, why did the relationship end? Is there still any contact? 

I wouldn't worry about the insurance policy. She cannot change someone else's policy and likely this guy will live for several decades and his beneficiary will change. That being said, it is a reflection of the seriousness of their relationship and her willingness to continue seeing someone who had a commitment to another person. 

I would inquire more as to the circumstances surrounding their relationship and make a gut judgement call at the end of the discussion. It's hard to tell at this point whether a moral lapse of judgement like this in a past relationship in her early 20's is reflective of the person she is and will be in your relationship today without really knowing her. While I wouldn't expect her to be apologetic of her past dating history before you met, I would at least expect a thoughtful, empathetic response with regards to the circumstances and their possible effect on her ex's family and spouse. "

496,"Fishy. Your ID can be used as fraud/identify theft. Definitely do not give someone a copy of it.

They both sound unreasonably crazy and illogical. So weird."
497,"The way my husband and I figured it- we worked it out so we did what worked best for us together as a unit. For example, he made more in one area, but my job opportunities were limited there. I found a job out of state that we moved for (he had a short term contract, he came when that ended) and job hunted there. His work is flexible enough, he had an easy enough time finding something comparable- so we ended up both with decent careers making more money than if he had made more and I made little in the previous area. 

It is important early in your career, that you be able to get a job utilizing your education that pays well. Some sacrifices are worthwhile to make that happen, otherwise you won't be able to capitalize on your education investment. Bumping up your paygrade tends to be better for a family unit (unless completely outlapped several times over by your partner- even then, there are sometimes still mental/emotional reasons to have some work). 

I am annoyed here because you made location choices on his preferences and now he decides he doesn't want to bother with any of it- Bullshit, if he felt that way, he should have voiced during the job search. Why did he let you go through all that effort of interviews and applications? That is really alarming and upsetting to me by itself. It shows dishonesty or worse. "
498,"What the fuck is she going to do all day if she's not ""housewife material"" and doesn't want to get a job?

Edit: and she's _29_ holy shit dude this is a massive red flag"
499,Not to mention a disgusting breech of privacy. I can not even imagine the kind of people who would be okay with sharing naked bodies of trusting women with strangers
500,"I live in Huntsville, AL (where NASA Marshall is located) and the cost of living here is fantastic and the city has been doing a great job promoting and expanding the arts and entertainment districts. Not only that, but once you're in the STEM bubble it's a small enough world to move up and around pretty easily. Never thought I'd like Alabama, but it's a great space town. 

OP, feel free to message me. "
501,"On the contrary, I think her shyness might explain a bit why she made this choice in the first place. Going to a friend who knows you for photos (yes, even naked, sexual photos) may have felt much *less* intimidating to her than going to a stranger, even if they are a professional. A friend is someone she trusts on a gut level, and taking photos like this, especially if it's not the norm for her, requires a lot of courage. Is she necessarily right in thinking this friend is a safer option than a professional? Probably not. And should she have considered her partner's feelings about it? Definitely. But it's an understandable impulse.

(For context, I am a woman who is very shy about my body, and the only time I've ever had a naked picture taken of me was for a friend's amateur photography project.)"
502,His response was cruel. You’re so young that nastiness isn’t worth it. There are others.
503,"That is SUPER creepy and not okay. Regardless of how close your families are, he is a minor and she is an adult. Imagine if this was the other way around and it was a 42 year old man with a 16 year old girl. Tell your mom very clearly that she needs to stop these jokes, not because they make you uncomfortable (although that should be enough) but because they are extremely creepy and cross a bunch of lines that should never be crossed. Make it clear that she may think she’s teasing and joking, but that she’s taking it too far and is going to embarrass herself if she doesn’t stop ASAP. 

This has nothing to do with you being a jealous person, and everything to do with your mom having appropriate behaviour/boundary issues.

Edited to add: Maybe ask how she would feel if his dad/some other 40+ year old man you know were making those kinds of jokes about you and smacking your ass."
504,"Problem: You have a friend who is a shitty person. Because he is a shitty person he is trying to push his shittiness on other people. 

Solution: Drop shitty people from your life. You might think, ""yeah but this doesn't directly affect me"". And that might be somewhat accurate. But you don't have to be murdered by a person to want to not be friends with a murderer. And you don't have to be cheated on by a person to not want to be friends with them either.  Shitty people like this guy bring drama and frustration. They spread it into the lives of those around them. So don't let him spread that stuff into your life. "
505,"No no no no no. Trust me, nothing good will come of this. There are no good intentions with a 25 year old man who’s trying to date a 16 year old. "
506,"This is what I was thinking, too. Twins only look alike to acquaintances, not to someone who's known you for a year. It's a freaky fetish and he's not being fair to his actual girlfriend. "
507,[removed]
508,"If he can't even recognise your body, then he doesn't get to enjoy it.

Leave. He's awful."
509,I think this answer makes a lot of sense. He should definitely charge a premium for after-hours. He should also hire a helper so you guys can plan a holiday for once in your life.
510,"Drop her. She'll come back crying for support in a year or so when she's replaced by someone younger/new or he magically still hasn't been divorced and she's pregnant and still doesn't have her thesis done or something dumb like that. It sounds like Kevin travels a lot or is away from his family for long times. She's probably not the first. You don't have to sit around and watch relatively smart people do stupid shit because of 'luuuuuv'. 

"
511,"Everyone else has made good points already, but I just wanted to add that it's really unfair to make your fiancé's parents' attendance contingent on your parents' attendance, especially when your parents are being so unreasonable. A good lesson for marriage is that treating your families fairly does not necessarily mean treating them the same."
512,"No you shouldn't, but if you push your daughter too much on this she might cut you off. "
513,"I was in a relationship like this a year ago and it sounds like the very beginnings of abuse. It seems like he doesn’t respect you, and you can’t be in a successful healthy relationship if you don’t respect the other person."
514,Same thing happened to me! Except I didn’t find out I misread his number until a month later when I ran into him and he asked why I never texted him. It’s definitely one of many possibilities 
515,"Thank you for saying all of this! I like what you said about explaining what is and isn’t helpful because I think the issue is *not* that he is trying to be overbearing or rude, I honestly think he just wants to help. For context, he is *very* communicative with me about how much he cares and shows it through actions in a multitude of ways— I think he just doesn’t understand and that’s the part I can help him with so that he knows how to better be helpful or supportive to me. "
516,"I mean... yeah, I’m sure he would rather share an entire house than live in a damn basement for $400/month. Doesn’t mean you have to let him. 

You wouldn’t expect him to pay half? Why not?

I’d be direct: “I appreciate the offer, but are you sure you could afford to move in? Splitting the expenses would be $1300-$1750/month.” When he responds that no, he can’t afford that, presto. There’s your answer for why he can’t move in. "
517,That’s a bummer. But you were an adult dating a high school girl who was obviously planning to go out of state for college. The relationship was doomed no matter what. Now you know already until waiting until months later after increasingly more infrequent and distracted communication on her part. 
518,"But when you two disagree, why does his way automatically win? Why doesn't your opinion matter?"
519,"Listen, despite how a lot of people treat them, a wedding isn't a pageant at Henry VIII's court or the red carpet of a movie premiere. It's a celebration of the joining of families, and the pictures are mementoes of the gathering of loved ones. Decent people don't hand out special places in their life to the most conventionally attractive people they know so their special occasion photos will look like publicity for Baywatch. Your brother asked you to be his best man because you're important to him. He wants you to have a prominent place in the celebration and his memories of it. If, after having been happy to agree to his request, you change your mind and decide to stay on the periphery of things, he'll be left to wonder why and maybe be hurt. I think all us commenters feel you'd be doing both of you a favor by telling your brother exactly what you heard and giving him the chance to see the error of their shared ways and make amends to you. Don't worry about his awkward position; he put you in one, even if you hadn't overheard, by not shutting down his fiancée's vile demand at the outset. Just because planning a wedding isn't easy, that doesn't absolve people of the basic obligations of decency like not emotionally jerking people around on the basis of what they look like.

There's a letter in Slate's advice column Dear Prudence that evokes your situation, except it's from the mother of the bride and about the bride's chosen maid of honor. I can't link, but you can find it if you Google ""Dear Prudence Katie limp."" The tl;dr is that the mother claims to love Katie, the MoH, but doesn't want her to fill that role because she limps. Dear Prudence tells her her stance is despicable and she needs to take a hard look at herself."
520,"Morgellon's is not recognized as a real disease by the medical community.  It is widely considered a symptom of a psychological disorder.

My aunt went through this.  She was obsessed with the ""fibers,"" followed all the forums, picked at her skin relentlessly trying to get the fibers out.  It pretty much ran her life for several years.  She went to many doctors, fishing for a diagnosis, and they kept pointing her towards psychologists.  

The ""fibers"" are usually either hair or just miscellaneous bits of environmental junk.  Carpet fiber, lint, whatever.  They convince themselves that it's a sign of the disease and usually get really obsessive about tracking/examining the fibers.

"
521,"&gt; Me: I'd literally go through hell for you. I promise that you breaking up with me is the worst thing for my anxiety right now.  

You realize you utilized your anxiety to try and get her not to break up with you right? No one is responsible for your mental health except for yourself. Your girlfriend is already going through so much with her sister literally having changed personalities from hitting her head and at the same time worrying about having to maintain consistent communication with you so that your anxiety doesn't hit the roof. You need to learn how to manage your own anxiety without becoming codependent on others to manage it for you. I don't mean to sound harsh but I hope this is the right push for you to get the help that you need. "
522,I'd say don't be friends with a person only around in the hopes you date them and who does stuff like this at the first opportunity.

525,"Too soon and he's looking to upgrade his living situation at a bargain rate.....at your expense.  Once he's in at $400 a month, good luck on increasing that to a reasonable amount.  Follow your instinct on this. "
526,"If you find yourself disgusted with her personal morals (or lack thereof) unless she makes a huge personality change anytime soon, you're not going to quit feeling that way. I'd call it a deal-breaker. "
527,"Dude what the fuck is wrong with you??
You are your own individual and the same for herself. Your dreams are your dreams and not hers. You are lowkey shaming her for not being able to live up to your lifestyle expectation.
Want to know what love is dude? Making it work no matter what. My next door neighbor works in the school system and has a decent paycheck. She has 4 kids. Her husband can't find a lot of great work cause he's an immigrant, but he still tries and does his share. They both make it work. Their kids are happy. Their lives are happy. Hell, I wish my life could be that way. And you are over here worried when you pay yourself 10k that your wife? Gf? Can't help you provide more for a 3k rent? Humble yourself and dont get lost in your money. Move somewhere cheaper or be a fucking man and provide. Does your gf even want to work in whatever you mentioned??? She probably feels hella guilty about not being able to help you more already."
528,"I can own up to that. I always assumed she would come around eventually. 

You know when my other son told me his girlfriend didn't want kids I told him that if this was a dealbreaker for him she deserved to know, and that you don't enter into a relationship assuming the other party will change their mind. I suppose I should have taken my own advice. "
529,"It should definitely be in person, probably not a physical note that she could find and get rid of. Maybe you and the guy could arrange to walk your dogs together?"
530,Even if you thought she was right neither of you have any say over your ex’s last name at this point and he sending that email is pretty nuts in my opinion. 
531,"So basically she's waiting for this woman to die, and is staking her claim in advance. Nice friend you have there."
532,"As a man. I agree you don’t have to tell him if you end it. If you keep it you absolutely should, but also remember not to take him back if he suddenly changes his mind and wants to be together "
533,"Okay thank you everyone. Sometimes you just need someone else to tell you that you aren’t overreacting and how you feel is valid. 

He’s continuing to lie, saying he didn’t know it wasn’t finalized and he keeps saying they weren’t legally together. Sorry, but the Circuit Clerk doesn’t lie. 

I’ll never know why he couldn’t have just been up front with me."
534,"If the relationship were toxic or there was abuse, I’d say get out now. However, if you care about this person and don’t harbor any ill will toward her, spend her birthday with her. It doesn’t have to be “fake,” either - celebrate like you would for a close, cherished friend. Fake would be getting her a promise ring or lingerie then pulling the romantic rug out from under her."
535,"That's incredibly shitty. Stay close with your brother, and both of you get outta there as soon as you can."
536,"&gt;As her friend, do I have a responsibility to tell her or not?

Yes."
537,"To be completely honest, if he went through with all of that, he is even more considered psychologically unstable. To go to those lengths to prove a point, that’s not normal behaviour. It’s not rational behaviour or thinking. Whether it’s delusions, or hallucinations, or depression - whatever psychological disorder - there’s still something wrong mentally that needs to be addressed. There’s a reason he doesn’t have motivation to find work or communicate to you respectfully or work towards a future with you - and it’s probably good that he’s in a place where those things can be addressed and treated with therapy or other modes of treatment.

543,"I really agree with this. She doesn't need to cover up because it is her activity she loves and fuck gender roles and all that. I myself would maybe prefer to cover it up at a nice event like a wedding and an ACE bandage would do that and it would allow OP to say ""I hurt my hand/wrist/whatever"" if this isn't her hill to die on."
544,That is definitely not depression. Your husband desperately needs psychiatric help from a professional.
545,"I mean, how explicit? Lips spread explicit, or nipple action explicit? 

He sounds like an amateur to me, like someone who is interested in photography, but doesn’t have the ability to do it full-time. I’m a “girl with a camera,” and I literally just have a camera. When it comes to buying gear, getting a really nice camera, setting up a studio, I’d say he is serious enough to potentially not be a creep. "
546,"Why not start by simply asking him when he is next WhatsApping what he’s talking about? Be calm about it, but pose the question, and wait for detail. 
Probably not popular consensus, but if it were me and the mistrust were already there, I think I would insist my partner let me see the chat for myself. BUT, that’s just me and in fairness my partner wouldn’t bat an eye at me asking that.
Remember that even if he isn’t doing anything, he is making you feel concerned through his behaviour and actions so it is at least partly his responsibility to quell your fears, whether this be by proving he is behaving faithfully (ie showing you his (hopefully) platonic conversation) or changing his behaviour (cutting out this persistent texting nonsense). 
"
547,"This is the right advice.

&gt;I don’t want them to worry about me, since this has already been super difficult for them

OP - this sounds like pride to me, and it's not the time or the place for it. It's okay if things don't work out with this guy. You didn't fail at anything. You might decide to stay in Vietnam, but do it for the right reasons.

I would also advice exploring options with him. You can't keep tiptoeing around the subject but you can start asking questions to better understand his reasons. Do you know his debt situation? Maybe it's not as bad as he thinks. Maybe it's worse. Is he open to other countries? Are you? You thought you were going to marry each other - what's he thinking about that? You guys need to air this stuff out."
548,"It can be really hard for people who had happy childhoods to grasp how horrible it can be to live in an abusive household. So they don’t always realize how damaging those small phrases are. 

I know you don’t want to disclose the gory details but there’s just no way around giving him some information if you want to be with him long term. You’re also going to have to explicitly tell him that a) those comments hurt and b)at least some explanation of why they hurt. 

You’re trained to avoid conflict but that won’t serve you well in a relationship. You have to talk to him about this. 

I had a pretty shitty childhood and I’m still dealing with my dad being a shitbag to this day. My husband had a great childhood. It’s actually been valuable for both of us to understand each other’s perspectives better. He’s helped me recreate some childhood memories and helped set a higher standard for our sons childhood. I have opened his eyes to how adults can be blind to their impact on children in the house. 

You can either date people who come from similar situations and understand through experience. Or you can date someone from the opposite side and have to help them come to understand your experience. 

If he’s the right person though he won’t run for the hills. Your mom is not a reflection of you. "
549,"LOL, she retired at the ripe old age of 38.

Tell your mom to get a job and don't give her another penny. She's going to drag you down."

551,"Is ... is his mother even sick?

Seriously, though, good job getting out of this. That sounds 100% like a mind%£$&amp; nobody needs. Let him go pretend to have cancer elsewhere, that’s sad and low.

Block him and go find people who are awesome!"
552,It is absolutely that serious. What you are describing is not normal. 
553,"hmmm reading this I feel you are at that point a lot of first generation immigrant get too as they grow up. You want to live a western womans life, drinking, work, dating, freedom.. but you are tied to your parents and their cultural expectations. Imo marrying this guy would be a huge mistake, he doesn't really know you and you don't really know him, you want different things from life. "
554,"Stick to the plan in three weeks. Does your little sister have a way of getting her documents like passport and birth certificate. 

If your mom is being that difficult you could all go low contact for now. Put her on an information diet. Dont give her keys to your house ect ect"
555,"Please just do. That was a conversation between him and his SO. Even if it sounded like he was agreeing with her, it could've just been him trying to calm her down. The important thing is that you don't know and the only way to really know is to talk things out."
556,"It's concerning to me that her parents and her friends and the rest of her family thought it was appropriate to further embarrass her-- if they thought this rumor was true-- by telling everyone that she had an STD (regardless of where she got it from) and that's the reason that you guys broke up. As a parent, if either one of my daughters broke up with their respective boyfriends, and anyone else asked me why they were no longer with their
 SO's,  I would simply say they broke up. I wouldn't go around telling anybody intimate details of why. That's nobody's business! When I walked out on my now ex-husband, I didn't tell my parents at all. I told my sisters and they helped me move to where I am now. It was a potential  domestic violence issue and I didn't want my parents to know because to me that was my dirty laundry and not their business. It had been going on for more than 20 years and I never shared any of that with anyone in my family so they were kind of blindsided although they had an idea once I finally told them simply because of my ex's personality."
557,"If someone had come and posted on here, and they said ""I have chlamydia, and I've been faithful, so my boyfriend had to have given it to me. He says he didn't. What do I do?""

You can be sure that she would have been told that she should leave him because she can't trust him, and to make sure she gets tested for other STDs to make sure he didn't give her anything else. If you've gotten proof that you've been cheated on, it's a good idea to get a full STD panel, especially so if you already have one. In general, chlamydia tests are less likely to lie than cheating boyfriends. This case was the exception, not the rule.

Was immediately telling everyone about it the best way to handle it? Absolutely not. But I don't think that believing an STD test given by a medical professional is any sort of indication that she's some horrible person."
558,"When I’m in a stressed out state of mind my boyfriend kind of goes along with and agrees with whatever I’m saying at the moment to kind of appease me till I calm down a little and can be more rational. I think that’d probably be the reason why your brother agreed with her.

I would talk to him and/or your parents about the situation. If you are just hiding and feeling sad all throughout the wedding they might think you’re not being supportive of them or it might come across as you sulking or being rude when that’s not the case. It’s always best to tell people where you are coming from so they don’t misinterpret or misconstrue your actions.

If you don’t feel comfortable being in the wedding party say so but make sure he knows exactly why. You should still show up to the wedding though. I am positive your brother would want you there! Lastly please please do some work and reflection on why you’ve reacted the way you have. You have every right to be mad or offended by what his fiancée said and yet you are beating yourself up over it. You who did nothing wrong and was so excited and supportive of your brother. You deserve to give yourself some more respect and you deserve to demand more respect from others. My brother has special needs and if my boyfriend EVER made a disparaging comment about him he’d be out on his ass in a second. Good luck and if you need someone to talk to please feel free to message me. I really feel for you. You said it was stupid for you to cry over this. It’s not. I have tears in my eyes just reading this. You have every right to be sad and upset. Remember that. 💕"
559,"Where is the school located? 

Honestly, it sounds like your cousin is sending her son to one of those illegal troubled teen schools. They’re illegal for a reason. And that reason is they’re trauma factories. "
560,"Twice a week until 4:30 am means either 1) she has managed to still pull off the ""out all night &amp; go to work after a quick shower"" act into her 30s 2) she works nights or a late shift so she can sleep it off for a few before work (also harder in your 30s) or most likely 3) she is spending her whole weekend in a cycle of drinking with friends, crashing at home and then getting up to do it again leaving OP more or less by himself all weekend. Given their history of co-dependency it sounds like she over corrected when she decided to get some independence back. OP needs to sit down with her and discuss that he doesn't want to go back to their codependent ways but he would like to spend some time with his wife awake and not hung over on weekends. "
561,"This is a HUGE FUCKING DEAL.

How are you going to trust this man going forward, especially when there it no good reason to lie about any of this?"
562,"You need personal therapy, like yesterday. And it is no surprise. You had a very unconventional upbringing, were not socialised properly, were taken advantage of by an adult...no one comes out of all that unscathed. I would be more stunned if you *didn't* have any issues.

But this is very much above Reddit's paygrade. You might be on the autism spectrum...but you might not. Your problems are likely related to your upbringing. Do not diagnose yourself online. See a specialist! "
563,"&gt; Anytime I try and say it makes me feel he always says “ that’s something I can’t quantify stay on the topic at hand”. At the end I’m always confused how I end up agreeing with him. 

That's called manipulation. He's basically saying what you feel doesn't matter because it isn't a quantifiable which is unfair, because all feelings are unquantifiable including his. 
"
564,"Yeah, this. For tonight, I'd counter-suggest going out somewhere. "
565,"&gt; I know choking is dangerous.

It's also one of the main predictors of someone getting killed by their partner in DV relationships. 

I'm so sorry this has happened, but please do not stay with him. Even if he abstains again, and starts going to meetings, he's dangerous for you now and you never know when he'll fall off the wagon again. "

567,"Then yes. Your 'blood' screwed you for life. 

You OWE NOTHING."

570,"\&gt;  when I told him this he just deflected and explained how hard it is for Ryan to go back to his own place ( shared with is ex gf ).

How awkward it's going to be for Jacob when he has to spent those days after being given the notice of eviction to now live with his ex-bf, so that his brother could avoid his."
571,I’m sorry but I couldn’t date anyone after that reaction. 
572,"I agree with this. As a commenter says below, it seems like your wife is picking and choosing what she chooses to believe from the Bible, and it's likely that you can't change her mind...I would focus on maintaining and strengthening your relationship with your son. Your undoubtedly knows how his mother feels about him, but you should step up and attend the wedding solo while shielding your son from any comments or actions your wife might make or take. I wonder if there are any religious but LGBTQA-friendly marriage counselors in your area?"
573,It cost you $60 to learn they weren’t really your friends. You didn’t do anything wrong by asking for money to stay there or for following up to ask for the money. 
574,"&gt; He had a heart attack a year ago.

He's not going to make it to his 60s. 

Honestly if this didn't affect him enough, I don't know what would. Screaming and crying and exploding is unfortunately not working, even though your upset feelings about this are completely valid. I work with people with serious mental illness, and your story sounds like what I experience trying to convince a client to change their diet due to a recent diabetes diagnosis. It seems to stick for only 48 hours, maximum, then its right back to ground zero. 

Of course you're scared, you have every right to be, and if he wasn't in denial, he would be too. The only thing I have to suggest is that you somehow enroll professional help of some kind. And if he won't participate, then you start working the professional anyways, so that you build the relationship with them and start learning communication skills to use on your husband. Whether this is a diatician, personal trainer, or therapist, I couldn't say."
575,"I think a lot of the 'problem' here is just with your own feelings about yourself. I mean, you say you don't get how your wife could be attracted to you, but also that she wants even more sex with you - so clearly SHE is attracted to you, you just aren't attracted to you.   


And that's spilling on to this thing. Whether she has a crush or not, or even realises it or this guy is just super charming it doesn't sound like anything bad is happening. She's just enjoying socialising and weirdly people in a good mood tend to be more fun - hence the good sex. Like I like all my friends, but different people leave different lingering effects, some friends make me feel relaxed, others can sometimes drain me, some of them leave me buoyed up and motivated and excited. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it's time to worry about the wife and friend situation, you said she's been good with crushes before so even if it is that there's no need to worry. The thing to focus on is yourself - why are you feeling so crappy about yourself and how can you make it better?"
576,"Huge red flag.  Do not marry this person.

""She's not housewife material"" means she doesn't want to do any of the household chores, no work at home.

""Doesn't want to find a job"" means she plans to stay at home.

So, while you're married she stays at home, doesn't do anything around the house; what does she do with all that time that she has?  The answer is ""online all the time"", shopping, ""friendships"", etc.

And if you divorce her, she gets half of your stuff AND you have to pay alimony so she can continue to have the same lifestyle.

Yeah I'd be looking for that deal too, if I were a slob with no morals.

For more yelling, tell her that if the wedding date has to be so soon (like she wants), you're ok with marrying fast, but want a prenuptial that will protect you from the alimony and losing half your stuff if there is a divorce.  EDIT:  The response to this will tell you whether we're right, or whether she wants to go fast because of ""bio clock is ticking"".

This won't get better.  Don't enter into any sort of relationship with him.  And I suggest you change all your passwords and add some form of 2 factor security to all your accounts so you get alerted if anybody tries to log into them. Which he probably will.

My family are similar so I understand how difficult it is to un-learn the defensive strategies that I taught myself to survive in that household. I still can't be in a building where men with deep voices are yelling or talking loudly because it terrifies me.

What I would do is verbally tell him if you are going to move near him or make a sudden movement. A simple ""I'm going to sit down next to you, okay?"" and then wait for him to nod or respond back. Show him with your words and actions that you are safe and won't touch him or hurt him."

583,"Hell, I’d tell anyone who asks. “Wow y’all broke up?”. “Yup, turns out she cheated on me with so and so. It took me by surprise, he was my best friend but not anymore”. They deserve to have everyone know what shitty people they are."
584,"As a military member, I would have your husband email him via work and tell him he wants to meet to discuss something. If he doesn’t get on his work email much, I mean the Shirt route is a definite option. Screw what happens to the other guy, he knew he was wrong. I had the same thing happen and not one friend told me and these were good friends of ours. I only found out a year and a half later after the divorce. Whatever you have to do to tell him, I would say just go for it. "
585,"If you aren't careful, you'll be another person on /r/legaladvice asking how to evict an ex who just won't leave their house.

Spoiler: You wouldn't be able to just kick him out. You'd have to have him served, via courts, and it could take 60+ days of him staying in your home before he would have to leave. Awkwardly hanging around, despite you two having broken up and despite him paying next to nothing... 

The red flag of ""should I move in with this person"" is when you have to ask a bunch of strangers ""should I move in with this person?""

No, no you shouldn't. Wait until a year+ into the relationship. If he's willing to break up with you over that, then you dodged a bullet anyway."

588,"I am a doctor (albeit still poor and in training). I think the number one benefit of this job is enough financial security as well as mental agency and confidence to do what I want in life and stand behind what I believe in. What's the point of you being a doctor and and have to defer to your husband in such simple things as giving your child money? Even my parents, who are immigrants and for years did not make much, have their joint accounts but ALSO their own spending money. You must have some sort of spending money saved aside from the family account. Use that.

Also, where I'm from, medical students are entitled to a quarter million line of credit loans (no questions asked besides your enrollment letter), which is more than enough for spending money AND tuition. Law students get a tiny fraction of that amount. Moreover, job security for medical students are much better than law students. Law/commerce students also need money for networking, sharp-looking clothes, etc more than med students, who basically survive in scrubs and ramen. Nowadays, no rigorous university program allows time for part-time jobs if you take a full course load. Your son may need to start volunteering at legal clinics, join business clubs, debate societies, charities, basically anything to boost his prestige for future articling opportunities. The competition for ANY position nowadays is so fierce that young people starting out need to be prepared to work for no pay. Your husband, and many of the old-timers, are delusional in thinking that things are the same as 30 years ago. Your son may also need to temporarily move to an expensive city for internships in the summer which most of his earnings will go to his expenses. In that regard, why doesn't your son deserve the same financial help as your daughter? This has nothing to do with ""spoiling"" your children."
589,Yeah bull*shit* he was “sent” this image. He found it himself because he gets his jollies from shady porn boards and is *incensed* that someone might be looking at his girlfriend the way he looks at other women (with or without their consent).

591,"His other tenant also thinks he's creepy. I want to get a camera to put in my room but anytime we connect something to the WiFi he must know about it. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but something on the interface with his router tells him exactly how many devices are on his network. It allows him to ""tag"" the devices in such a manner where he knows if it's my cell phone on the network, my computer, etc. So if I got a camera it would show up as an unrecognized device and he would ask about it."

594,"So much this. Our (husband and I) old roommate was also like this. Every single time he saw us would be a chance to socialize for this guy. Door crack opened? Socialize. Sees us going through the hallway to our room? Socialize. Sees my husband gets out of the bathroom? Socialize. Husband and I lock ourselves in our  bedroom? Knocks on our door until we come out, take 20 seconds to think of something to talk about then talk about it for hours. Just like OP’s neighbor, he would wait for us to open our bedroom door to strike for conversations that would’ve lasted hours had my husband not just stopped talking altogether, living him rambling to himself then literally closed the door on his face. At first I thought that was a little rude but then I realized the madness would never come to an end otherwise. We in fact didn’t get to use the living room because neither of us was friendly enough to have small but long talk all day everyday. "

He makes regular racist or homophobic comments. 

He’s rude to servers.

Let me tell you, OP: your sister's comments were pretty crappy in and of themselves, but to make those comments at or immediately after a wedding is a level of crassness that is spectacular to behold.

She should apologize to you; what she said was so gross on so many levels. And you should absolutely NOT capitulate to this unspoken pressure to make peace. Take a break from her. She sounds utterly exhausting."
604,"Dude, no. She acted in a manner that is racist and cruel. She demeaned you in a way she obviously knew would hurt you.  After expressing these sentiments to her it didn't remedy things. There is no version of his that ends well. There's loads of great girls out there who will like your dick just fine, and most importantly because it's attached to the person they love."
605,"Lots of people have given good advice, and I agree she should get a second opinion. But I want to commiserate and let you know that it’s not completely abnormal. I fucking hated being pregnant. I was miserable, in pain all the time, not sleeping, crying, the works. My uterus bruised my tailbone FROM THE INSIDE. As soon as my son was born, most of the pain was just gone. All of that weight off of my frame, the hormones changing, it was so much better. Keep a close eye on her for pre and post partum depression. I had PPD and PPA and didn’t get help until 7-8 weeks after he was born. After starting Zoloft everything was clearer and I felt like more of myself again. Pregnancy is HARD. She’s a rockstar and she’s so close, just be there for her. "
606,"&gt;So at the start of our relationship things weren’t going well, he cheated on me a few times. But he told me it was because I ignored him and didn’t see him a lot.

Yeah that ""reason"" was 100% bullshit. He cheated because he's a cheater.

&gt;What should I do, believe him? 

*fuck* no


&gt;I feel emotionally trapped because I do love him but I’m hurt and I don’t think I can leave him because **he will be all alone with nobody left.**

And whose fault would that be? His."
607,"Did she cancel tonight, because to me that looks like she's saying it's going to be take out or eating out.

And she has a child. Children come first. If you can't handle that then you should move on."
608,"Chances are she did not have ""true feelings"" for Boy X. She just did not want anyone else to foreclose her options."
609,"You need couples counselling, someone who can deal with both communication, feelings and the financial aspects. Money problems quickly become very serious in marriage. They're either worked out, handled and buried by the more responsible person, or lead to divorce.

It's understandable to get angry when money is suddenly gone, but if your anger gets the upper hand, OP, you need to work on this too."

612,"Yes, thank you! After clearing her computer of any keyloggers or spyware, she needs to change her passwords at a location that is not her apartment - preferably on a secure internet connection at her work or friends house."
613,"Are you on the same page about having/not having children?

Are you on the same page, or at least have a respectful tolerance of the other's opinion, when it comes to religion, politics, and morality?

Are you both in agreement on finances? How to split things? What would happen if one of you lost your job? Who, if anyone, would stay home to take care of kids?

Are you able to support yourselves independently? Aka are you financially independent?

Have you lived together for at least a few months and been able to survive sharing a space? Sharing cleaning responsibilities and chores? Can you coexist in a shared space and still love each other?

Do you trust each other?

Is your relationship happy and healthy? No resentment or unresolved issues?

Are you able to communicate with each other and resolve issues amicably?

If yes, you're ready.

There's no magic milestone of time, or income, or having a house: you just need to be on the same page about how you'll manage the important bits of life. "
614,"I was with a guy like this once and even though his self-glorification wasn't constant, it was wearing, disgusting, and a huge turn-off. Once he showed me a drawing he thought was really good and it looked like something a third-grader did. I had to run to the bathroom to laugh out loud.

We both wrote poetry, and some of his was decent. Some of mine was too. But he felt the need to tell me how I should ""improve"" mine - I didn't ask for a critique either; he had asked me to share it.

He was hung like a light switch, and talked a lot about how size didn't matter and his sexual prowess more than made up for his lack of size (it didn't). 

The final straw was when he met my parents. He gave my mom advice on how to improve her cooking. He gave my dad advice on how to improve his gardening (my dad is a master gardener - total green thumb, manages three gardens for hobbies while working full time, type A to the hilt, whole yard is full of flowers, shrubs, herbs...you name it). 

When I got back to my dorm with the boyfriend after that jaunt my mother was calling. I picked up and her first words were ""Dump him."" I listened.

Now I'm passing that advice on to you. lol. "
615,That's gonna be a no for me dog.
616,"&gt;But part of me also feels very jealous because I can't make my wife perk up like that anymore

Is this really a ""can't"" though? Or an ""I stopped trying because I'm depressed and insecure so why bother?"" 

People like attention and being made to feel funny and attractive. If you don't want your wife to feel like she needs to seek that out from someone else then it's your damn job to make her feel that way. "
617,"&gt;&gt;He said his friend was just a joker, but pretty harmless.

Sure, a harmless joker who assaulted you in a bar. Your bf is being an ass about this. "
618,"I have a $300 diamond necklace from an ex. I do not think about him when I'm wearing it. It's just a very pretty piece of jewelry. 

I would understand if someone else couldn't help but associate the necklace with my ex. I would be okay switching it out for a different necklace, but one I could picked out and that was also just as nice. 

You could maybe express it in that way and ask if you can buy her something new. I wear mine because I'm not about to spend $300 and I don't have anything else as nice. Maybe if she had something different she might consider. The imporant part though is to let her pick. 

She may decline. Please don't take it as she doesn't care about your feelings. She may just really love the necklace. If an ex bought you really nice clothes, would you stop wearing them?"
619,"It's not your job to keep their marriage stable, nor is it your job to include your step sister when she's not making any effort to form a good relationship herself. Focus on what you're trying to focus on.

You shouldn't be bending backwards for your mom's marriage or the step sister if this is the way they are being. Sure it's family, but you shouldn't be expected to help just because they're family. You're entitled to do what you would like to do, especially as adults (and almost an adult)

You're mature enough, stand your ground. You got this 👍🏻"

Lost it there."
622,"Yeah, ace bandage sounds good to me. IMO you don't need to cover up the *fact* you have an injury, but cover the actual injury. Covering from shame is bullshit, but i do think it's kind of grody and rude to be all scabby at somone's event, and a bit unhygenic looking when it's on your hands. Nobody wants to think about whether your finger scrapes and scabs are getting into the potato salad in the buffet line. I would expect a dude to cover up a similar injury as well... 

And remember, if anyone asks or makes a big deal about your injury, **they** are the ones actually being super rude for even bringing it up! But if anyone does mention it, eh, just be light about it, no need to get tmi about the specifics about being so angry and drunk. ""Oh, it's just a little scrape from training... I kickbox"". "
623,"This is the best advice here, by far! 4 people living in a 1 bedroom is a pressure-cooker situation. Since OP says its a 1 bedroom, not a studio, they need to set up the two cribs in the living room area, like, NOW.

I've dated, and been married to, my fair share of abusive men, and despite what OP's husband did, he doesn't sound like an abuser. He sounds like a man who snapped under stress and actually feels remorse. If this was not a one-time incident and OP is worried that this will keep happening, she should leave. If this is absolutely the ONLY time this has ever happened, I think it would be fair to ask him to attend some anger management sessions.

But, most importantly, they need to first address the nightmare that is their current sleeping arrangement. It is \*really\* unhealthy for every single member of this family and it's going to be a huge contributing factor in fracturing the family as a whole."
624,"Your boyfriend is not giving you empathy you deserve.

If you told him his dick was small, he’d be upset. But with his logic, there’s no point in lying to him, why be nice just to be nice?

It’s flawed. Please reconsider if you would want to have a future with a man who makes you feel so shitty."
625,"Doing nice things for him doesn’t mean the relationship is healthy, even on your end. It sounds like you care about him a lot, but you also say that you have been given reason to be suspicious of him. Now he’s behaving really oddly and making bizarre accusations, and that’s not particularly healthy either. "
626,And why would he refuse to show the picture he received from the friend? Something doesn’t add up here...
627,"Let her know that any time she disparages your wife, that’s two weeks no contact. If it continues after a while, make it three."
628,"Update: Thanks for the responses everyone. I actually don't have a boyfriend. The guy I'm seeing is just a ""guy I'm seeing"". So I can't necessarily use that ""my bf....."" technique (although now I don't have to, you can read on).

We ended up going to dinner and he paid for me, and internally I was like ""FML"", and I did offer to pay twice but he still insisted. So I took the free food. After eating we went back to our building, and he told me he will let me know when he's done setting up his projector and that I can come over. I was like sure. When I went over, **HIS ENTIRE APARTMENT WAS DARK WITH TWO SWEETLY SCENTED CANDLES LIT, AND AN ANIME MOVIE PROJECTED ON THE WALL, CURTAINS ALL SHUT.**

I ended up telling him that I just want to talk and get acquainted more, and so that's what we did. So I asked him to turn on the lights. The conversation went well and I found out he's 29. He's really worldly, decently good at English, and I can tell he's smart. It was fun talking about our neighbors and learning about them - I don't know much about anyone in our little building.

**At the end I told him that I wanted to make sure that he knows I'm not interested in anything sexual or romantic,** and he was like yeah I'm super busy and I didn't even consider that when he came to say hi today. And I told him that **I was really freaked out by the candles and the darkness.** And he said lmao I didn't even realize how weird it was, because he needs it to be dark to watch things using the projector and the candles were to make it slightly lighter. He said he thinks it might have been less creepy if he had the lights on at first and apologized for that. Idk how much of that is BS but it was good to get on the same page. I also asked him if he was into guys or girls and he said girls, lol.

So that's that. I didn't want to post a whole new update thread but I still wanted to notify everyone who took the time to respond - or if you stumbled on my thread just now, this is the latest!

I feel like after reading the comments, though, I should still be a bit wary or keep it cordial and not let it get BFF-like. I still don't know him that well. Please, if you have any thoughts, I'd still really appreciate them.

**Update 2**: He texted me this morning saying ""sorry for creepy impression"" and that he didn't even think about how it could be creepy. That his American friends use candles in their homes all the time and so he's been trying to do the same. And that he wants to hang out again when I have a day off."
629,"Ask your father why he and your mom never married. It could be that it was her wish. It could be that there were other factors, like family, financial or legal reasons. Maybe something practical, like insurance. Or maybe it's simply that he's getting older and now he wants to experience the ring and it's important to Mary Ann. 

It does not have to do with a reason that tarnishes your mothers memory. After all, a marriage is not a guarantee that a couple has a successful relationship, if you consider how many end in divorce. It sounds like your parents were together til the end. 

Two years is actually pretty average for most couples to figure out if they want to stay together, so to me it doesn't sound too fast. It seems like you're worried that your father will forget your mother and need some assurances about her role in his life. Have a talk to him about her. She's gone, but she's not forgotten. 
"
630,"Dude, move on, but why stay in France, man, if your not comfortable there, go back to the UK!"
631,"I really strongly agree with this. OP, you know you can't tell your boyfriend about your friend's trauma, but you also can't carry this burden alone. I really strongly urge you to seek professional counselling over this. Talk to someone who you can trust be completely separate from the situation, whose only role is to help *you* get through this.

Your boyfriend will hopefully see this as progress, since you wouldn't be bottling it up."
632,"Yep. We can take the vegetarianism out of this and the issue remains. MIL forced a little child to eat a food they are not used to, did not want, and which made them sick. A food the child's parents specifically did not want the child eating. If someone forced my child to eat *anything*, after I had told them not to, I would be livid. The vegetarian part is just MIL's justification (even though she is wrong - well-rounded vegetarian diets are perfectly nutritious).

And MIL's reward for her terrible behaviour should be no more unsupervised time with her grandchild. She brought it on herself."
633,"You admit in this post that you get lost in your woodworking for literally hours, sometimes forsaking sleep. So yeah, you spend a shitload of time doing it. She's telling you that she's feeling that you're neglecting her and the kids. She's not telling you to stop your hobbies. She's telling you to find a more reasonable balance of time. That's not a crazy request.

Regarding the finances, how much say does your wife have in budgets? How is money allocated to her? "
634,Oh fuck that noise. That's 50 shades of psycho you are dealing with. Do not get rid of your fish. They were there before her and I swear to god if you have locks on your doors - lock em. Fishies will be in the toilet if you don't. Keep things strictly professional and do not walk on eggshells around this girl. Stand up for yourself because she seems like the kind of person that will keep harassing you if you let her. Don't text her but be direct in conversation. She will screw herself over. 
635,This right here is the correct answer. Poor guy is about to make a huge mistake. He asked his brother for a reason and now this crazy person is about to be a permanent member of the family. Ouch. 
636,"She's either got anxiety or a very different view of security than you. All you can do is decide whether this is your hill to die on. It's your home too, and it sounds like her initial promise not to use them all the time is worthless. "
637,"&gt;Every time i've talked to him in the last 10 days we've gotten into a fight. Everything from a full blown fight to passive aggressive squabbles. 

Take law school out of this. Say you're a woman of leisure. This is still nuts. "
638,"Agree completely. OP's final question was

&gt; Is it fair and reasonable to ask that he sever this relationship with his coworker?

But that's no longer relevant - she's *already* asked, and he's already made it clear that he'd rather break up with OP than ease back from his coworker.

OP, you know it's time to leave this relationship. You say the trust is broken. You explained your dealbreakers, and they're incompatible with his clearly-stated views on this friendship. If you stay, you're conceding that these *aren't* dealbreakers, so it'd be exceedingly unfair and immature to keep bringing the ex up as an issue anyway.

Time to move on to someone more compatible with your own personal boundaries."
639,"Even as a hardened meat-eater myself, your MIL can fuck right off. Your child, your rules - you sound like you're on top of any nutritional issues, so this is just her being desperate to stomp boundaries and show you who's boss. It's **all** about control, and nothing to do with legitimate concerns. I'd love to know why your husband thinks that toxic grandparents are worth having? Because no-one, whether family or not, is worth having in your life if they make it worse overall.

She ignored your wishes, made your daughter sick and miserable, and lied to you about it. Why would you want someone like that in your life, and especially in your daughter's life?

The advice is sadly very simple. **At best** no more unsupervised visits with your daughter, likely ever. She's demonstrated that you can't trust her, and there's no way to get that back, at least any time soon. Because say she says ""I've learned my lesson, never again"" - she's already lied once and covered stuff up, all she'll do is make a bigger effort to hide her shittery next time.

Total no contact is something people often recommend, but that's a big step to take, and might be a hard sell for your husband if nothing else. You can decide entirely what you're comfortable with, if anything. Be punitive if you need/want to be, but remember first and foremost any response is about protecting yourself and your daughter, not about ""punishing"" your MIL, no matter what she says.

I'd also say you should demand a full apology to you and your daughter, acknowledging what she did and why it was awful. Sorry to say I don't think you'll get it, but that might demonstrate how toxic she is, because anyone with half a soul would if nothing else be able to fake one! But I predict you'll be met with a lot of denial and defensiveness and somehow twisting it around so you're at fault. Look up DARVO, and also the website Out of the FOG."
640,"I work in domestic violence and this is the beginning of the end. He is not accountable for how he is making you feel. It will only get worse. Get out now while you can. Trust me on this. 

EDIT: if accountability is missing from your partner, they will not change. Insight is necessary. I think its a disservice to people to sugar coat this. 

Its my opinion, you dont have to agree :-)"
641,Even without an STD it can hurt her. Lies poison relationships whether or not both parties are aware of them.
642,"Ugh, situations like this make me sick, I'm really sorry this happened to you. This piece of shit sexually harasses you and *you're the one getting grief??*

&gt;To Michelle, I think I owe her an apology.

Why? Because her husband sexually harassed you and you (rightfully) warned others that this person is a sexual harasser?

No, you owe her nothing but the truth: you didn't know the guy feeling you up without your permission and trying to get with you was her husband, and you told the group so they wouldn't get harassed too.

Kudos to you for realizing that ""sketchy shit thrives in the dark"" (totally stealing that phrase btw) and it's very important that sexually inappropriate and harassing behavior like Jim's is called out and exposed for the vile thing it is.

This is despicable of your team to not support you. You did nothing wrong: Jim did something very wrong, and now he's embarrassed because he got caught, and so is his wife. That's on Jim to fix, not you.

EDIT: as to how to proceed, if you really feel you need to say something else, you could send out another message to this effect:

""While I did not realize that Jim was Michelle's husband, that does not change what happened. Jim tried to feel me up several times. He put his hands on my waist and upper thighs repeatedly, and it made me feel so uncomfortable that I called an Uber and left early. I sent out that message because I have no interest in crossing paths with him again, and to warn the other women in our group about him. I've encountered this kind of behavior before and it's not innocent or misinterpretation, Jim put his hands on me in a sexual way without permission, and that's not ok with me. That's it, no more, no less."""
643,Do her parents even want her there every weekedn? Because my sister and her husband come to my parents pretty much all day sunday  and they just don't know how to get them to cut their visits shorter because it stops them being able to relax. 
644,"You are going through a massive crisis because of significant changes in your life. It is perfectly normal, and you will get used to it in time. Most people don't feel quite as bad about working because they have gotten used to it. But a lot of people feel like that e.g. on Sunday nights when the dreaded workweek is ahead again. 
Talking to a therapist would probably help. But developing skills will help too. 

Your time used to be yours and you could do whatever you wanted with it. Now, with someone else dictating how to spend the most of your day, it has become a precious commodity, and you need to get much better in using it and organising it. You say you have no time for anything, but you have *three hours* to recover after work! That is loads of time. What did you use to do when you didn't work? What did you enjoy? Go back to those hobbies and schedule them in to your week. Make clear time slots for them so that after work you have something fun to look forward to and life isn't just about work. Even if you feel tired at first, make yourself do what used to be normal. 

I would also recommend scheduling in something fun for first thing in the morning, e.g. exercise. That way when you wake up, it's not ""oh no, I have to go to work"", but you actually have an hour of something enjoyable to do before the 'getting ready for work' starts. Running is the easy one, because you can just get your kit ready in the evening, throw it on and be out the door in five minutes enjoying the sunshine - or the rain. 

Building a weekly schedule for everything will help anyway and there are all sorts of cool organisers and youtube videos on how to do that. The benefits are: you will get stuff done, you have a record of what you've been doing and you can see it's not all work, and you have things to look forward to - and you can achieve things because you have a plan for them.

Talking of achieving, you have decades of work ahead, so it is probably best to start thinking about getting an education and an interesting job in something you actually like. If you have no idea what you're interested in, sample lots of different courses online, e.g. on coursera, go to the library and browse books, read blogs and watch videos. Take your time and keep your mind open. I guarantee you that eventually you will find something that makes you excited and wanting to learn more. Then build that learning into your weekly schedule. It doesn't have to be a degree, it might e.g. be a special skill that helps you set up your own business.

You are going through a massive life change, and possibly the first big challenge in your life. It is scary, it is exhausting, you will often have no clue what to do. But if you keep your mind open, get curious and are willing to learn, anything can happen and you can become anything you like. I believe in you!"
645,"Seriously, sleep deprivation combined with a tendency toward paranoid delusions is a very bad combo. 

I'm confident you'll be feeling better soon, OP. Great job making choices that support your health!"
646,Because he's subbed to the group and doesn't want OP to know. 
647,You come first.    End of story.  If he won't try with you then he doesn't get off or he masturbates.  If he refuses to work with you on this then you have to decide if sex is a deal breaker for you or not.
648,I am assuming you got married knowing about some of these incompatibilities but thought with love you could overcome this. Naturally assuming your husband thought the same. Essentially you both separately thought you could persuade the other to compromise toward the other person's vision. Nope nobody can do that. You have to share the same vision. Every detail? No. But in general yes. I think you two are incompatible on core values and vision.
649,"&gt; I know I am going to get a lot of flak for me snooping, I know I deserve it.

No kidding.  Honestly, between the gross violation of your snooping, and the incredible emotional baggage you've been heaping onto your girlfriend, I think the best thing to do would be to end the relationship to give yourself the time and space you need to deal with your own issues."
650,"So you're a meal ticket who babysits his kids he can fuck. Wow, he is playing you like a fiddle."
651,"Yes! Expanding on that, when you're in a relationship with someone that young you can easily develop the same power dynamic that you have with your uncle. You're more experienced, she loves and trusts you, and would likely defer to you to make important decisions about her own life. She's already used to people trying to control her, and that probably feels safe to her on some level. At risk of settling into my armchair, I'd bet that's a big part of why was pursuing you. She needs some time dating on a level playing field so she can figure out what's important to her. Source: was the girl in a similar situation. You're doing the right thing."
652,"Dude it’s your house. 

There are tons of women out there who put “women only” on their roommate ads. Sure it’s for a different reason, but honestly you can do whatever you want. If you wanted to basically hire a man to do your yard work, that’s your prerogative. 

Only deal with your roommate. She isn’t your problem. Tell him that you are sorry but those were the terms of the lease. You don’t want to be a third wheel in your own house. Tell him that you’re sorry if it causes problems in his relationship. He is getting a sweet deal and there are many other people who would love to be in his position. Easily replaceable if it gets bad. 

Also, tell him to please ask his girlfriend to stop arguing with you in your own house. "
653,"&gt; Met this girl back in May.

So you've only known this girl for 4 months.

&gt; The only stressor on the relationship was that she frequently had to cancel dates for family emergencies

This shouldn't be a stressor. This should be when a significant other is supportive and patient. You seeing this as a stressor is a big indicator of whats to come.

&gt; What she added in the text was that she had a panic attack at the hospital because she was afraid of how I would react to another cancellation (important a bit later).

She basically laid it out all up front. She knows you aren't capable of handling this anxiety yourself, and *needed* you to be understanding through this. She was *dreading* dealing with this because of how *you'd* react. That is not a healthy relationship (and it seems she saw that). 

&gt; I tell her I'm so sorry, I understand, that she doesn't have to worry about my reaction, that I hope her sister is okay.

This should have been the end of the conversation. This should have been where you gave space freely, and gave her time.

Instead..

&gt; Saturday goes by and I don't hear from her, so I call her in the evening because I'm sort of freaking out about not having any details about her or her sister. I get a text saying ""[Sister] isn't doing well, please give me time to be with her. I'll talk to you tomorrow.""

&gt; The next morning (last Sunday), I call her

Dude.... give the girl the girl what she asked for. **Space**. She needed time to deal with an actual issue. She should not have had to worry about you freaking out over the fact she's not replying. She's got way more important things going on. This is where I would have personally blocked you. Its a bit smothering. Who are you to *need* to know details of the sisters health? Its okay to be concerned, but demand updates from someone you've known for four months, of a family member you probably have never met? Nice try on the nice guy act, but this is a bit manipulative. You didn't want updates on the sister in reality, you just wanted to hear from your girlfriend. Obviously this four month relationship did not leave you in a place in her mind where she felt she needed to rely on your for comfort/support. There *are* some women who can flat out handle this themselves and prefer to deal with things their own way.

&gt; Can we talk about something, or is now a bad time?

Seriously dude? YES ITS A BAD TIME, SHE SHOULDNT HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.

&gt; I need you to communicate with me more--I care so much about you and I just need to know what's going on once in a while.

Extremely co-dependent here. You *need* her to communicate more.. Pretty demanding.

&gt; So I talked to my therapist about this...when I was in the hospital, I had a panic attack because I was afraid of how you'd react. That's not how I should have reacted when my sister was bleeding from her head in the hospital. My therapist said you're co-dependent.

The truth you needed to hear.

&gt; You don't want to break up do you?

Escalating the situation. Making a mountain out of a mole hill. 

&gt; I'd literally go through hell for you. I promise that you breaking up with me is the worst thing for my anxiety right now. I love you and I'm here. Whatever you need. I'll fly to Boston if you need. Please don't break up with me.

This just makes you sound extremely needy and manipulative. Not fair buddy, and NOT what you say to someone going through her situation.

&gt; And everything's okay with us? I'm just afraid of waking up one day with a text from you where you break up with me.

Seriously dude, you have turned a legitimate tragedy into something *all* about you. That is what proves to me you don't actually care about the wellbeing of said sister, and just wanted attention from the girlfriend. You are trying to manipulate her into talking to you again.

&gt; Yes. I just want to know how your sister's doing and how you're doing. Do you think you could just text me once a day?

She tried to change the conversation and you brought it right back to a conversation where she previously tried to soothe your worries.

&gt; Then I went to write a message about how she shouldn't worry about me or my anxiety at all, but just focus on her sister. 

So you got her to agree to talk to you, manipulated her into feeling like your anxiety is one of her problems to deal with, and then ~~kindly~~ let her know not to worry about you. The emotional roller coaster of this post, holy cow, I feel so bad for this girl.

&gt; Hi [my name]- I can't continue to date you anymore because I need to focus on my sister and it is more severe than I made it seem. I felt concerned expressing this over the phone when you began to panic and have alerted the police for your safety, as you are in a very fragile headspace.

Quite possibly the best thing she could have done for you, my friend. You *need* help, and truly need to get actively working towards bettering yourself and getting a grip on your anxiety/codependency.

&gt;  I'm going crazy. I want closure. I want to know what happened and I want to know how her sister is doing. I want to know how someone could ghost me ten minutes after saying they loved me. I just want one more conversation with her. I don't know what to do.

Just stop with the sister part dude. You are using this as a way to justify your actions as normal and compassionate, but they are false. Clearly proven by the following sentence. This girl needed space, and you smothered her. 

&gt; She was literally just ripped from me and I have no fucking clue why.

Because you are extremely co-dependent and not mentally stable enough for a healthy relationship. You can't even accept that this was a legitimate choice made by her, instead you see it as her *ripped* from you. Thats such a victim way to look at things.

&gt; And unfortunately I'm blocked and have no way of explaining or apologizing

Are you really absorbing any of the advice given to you? Reaching out and explaining/apologizing is SOOOO not the thing to do. Back to square one of smothering the girl, and not giving her space.

You need to leave this girl alone. 100%. You need to take these issues into your own hands and seek help for yourself. You truly need external help with this or else all of your relationships are going to struggle.

Please, heed all the advice and for the love of god, leave this girl alone.

Edit to add - 

&gt; This is incredibly insightful. Thank you. I am in therapy (I have been for years), and we had both spoken previously about how I was going through a particularly bad rough patch and she mentioned how she would support me through it, not run from it. I guess it got to be too much.

SHE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR HANDLING YOUR ANXIETY. I guess it got to be too much? Well since you are relying on other people to fix issues you wont properly address, of course its too much. You obviously need a better therapist. I'd seek a second opinion for sure.

&gt; And (not trying to justify my behavior here, just explaining), 

Yes you are doing exactly that. Justifying your behavior.

&gt; at the time when I was badgering her, I literally had no idea about the severity of the problem. I thought it was a broken or fractured wrist or bump on the head because she didn't give me any other information (which is what I was asking for). In retrospect, the burden I was being is incredibly clear to me.

Who cares about the severity of the problem? Whether she had a paper cut or was in a coma, you should have respected your girlfriends requests of needing time and space with her sister. Its not up to you to decide the severity of the problem.

655,"Definitely try to stay off the streets.

Look for resources willing to help you that are not your parents (family, aunts, grandparents, godparents, ask if Ava's family may be willing to help if she's out, teachers you really trust, etc). Just as a backup.

If there's no one who can help you, suck up to your parents for as long as necessary. If conversion camp isn't in the future, a local pastor and some 'prayers' probably won't kill you. 

If you don't have any funds, try to get some. Do some work and save up. It sounds like you won't want to be living with your parents when you can get out. "

658,"Honestly examine what right you have to be angry/ upset? Because from the sounds of this the only person responsible for those feelings is you. 

She clearly expressed her needs, and chose to prioritize herself and her emotions, at a time when she is undergoing a lot of stress. I think that speaks incredibly well of her and her commitment to being the best possible mother for your child.

What you can do moving forward, is firstly accept that she made the best choice for her at that time, and ask what you can do so that she feels able to stay with you during difficult times. Secondly, you need to really examine your priorities. Emergencies happen literally all the time, and this isn't going to get easier when there is a tiny sleep depriving machine living with you. What are your priorities? How can you arrange / change your life so that it better reflects those priorities? "

He's 32yo, has no responsibilities, doesn't have to pay for anything, gets to play games all day. He has it good...

But then you want to take that all away. 

So he decided to play on your emotions because there's no way you would take away his fun time if he's mentally ill. 

Take a screenshot of the history. All of the history. Email it to his doctor. 

Get a copy of the police report. Get an Restraining order. Because regardless if his is faking or not, he's dangerous to you. 

Contact his family to get him and his things.

663,"Never even thought of that, but you are very probably right. I haven't seen OP post about how long they've been together (I might have missed it in a comment or something), but if it's been 6+ months, she might have been envisioning the two of them moving in together in the near future, especially since he says she already spends most nights at his place. When OP dropped the ""I'd like to have a day or two apart during the week,"" she took it as ""I don't want us to live together.""

At 28 she is probably very invested in finding a long term partner, especially if she wants kids, and that will involve moving in together and subsequently not having/very rarely having days away from each other."

665,"Also have her look at the costs of more mundane things, like treatment costs for comment ailments the elderly get. Being old is expensive partially because of how many health problems hit at once.

Some people are calling OP entitled, but honestly, the biggest concern here is that mom will turn into the family financial albatross because she gave all her savings to charity. People aren't robots, and I doubt anyone in OP's family would let her rot on the streets if she did this and then discovered all the reasons people keep retirement savings. 

Even stuff as simple as food and a roof over her head needs to be paid for, and it's unlikely social security would give her enough to cover that *and* all the healthcare costs older people tend to incur. It'd be messed up to use her kids as her new retirement plan when she already had retirement funds and simply gave it all away. She shouldn't rely on her husband to cover everything either, considering how (justifiably) angry he is over this."

""I'm sorry you feel that way but this is the reality of the situation.""

""I love you and I'm not angry at you, but things do need to start transitioning.""

And if he gets too wound up and defensive, something like ""You're pretty upset right now and I'm not sure why. It's not unreasonable to expect you to do chores. Let's take a ten minute break and then come back to this. I'm going to go fold some clothes/wash the dishes/whatever.""

686,"I’m sorry, your bf is advocating that your father not spend time with your future child?

So your FiL kills your father’s close childhood friend  FiL **doesn’t even get punished for it because of police corruption from FIL’s father** and now your father is about to lose access to his grandchild, too?

God OP, I truly don’t understand why you’re taking such a hard stance against your dad here. Your dad shouldn’t behave as he has, but it’s pretty understandable. 

Nowhere in your story do you talk about the regret FIL felt about *not paying justice for his crime*. You seem perfectly happy with the ‘mistakes of youth’ explanation and happy to move along. Have you ever considered that you can almost certainly guarantee that FIL would pull the same illegal strings to get your bf out of trouble if he committed a crime?

I get that it’s currently *easier* and more fun to spend time with your bf’s parents. But I cannot fathom why you find it so easy to consider cutting your father off for what is essentially him taking a hardline against murder and corruption. 

Before giving up, consider doing family counselling. He may never forgive that family, but there may be ways to find a middle ground where he behaves better. "

The tattoo his teacher had was very important to *him* as a person. You and your husband might not know what each tattoo meant to that man and how he felt about them. Your husband seems to just want the same thing because it's what his teacher had. That's a bad reason. Your husband doesn't have the same connection to each piece. He's just copying what he saw. 

I'm sure his teacher/father figure/friend didn't teach him to imitate what someone else has done, I'm sure he taught your husband how to stand for himself, by himself and to be his own person.

Tell him to create his own tattoo, or to work with the same artist in creating something new that reminds him of his teacher. He can create a tribute to wear with him forever. Maybe something smaller because this isn't for ""show"", it's for himself to honor his teacher's memory. "

I wonder if there's something more underlining it like your wife has other issues with your sister or has some other reason for being resentful that you've helped out, like maybe she feels like you may not give her enough attention or gifts, or maybe she had to struggle on her own for a while and is of the opinion that if she had to do it, so do others? 

I would suggest couples counseling to help figure put what's going on and if there's  a way to help your wife feel better without sacrificing your support for your sister. "

The two endings in that scenario are usually that some of the people who've either been oblivious or tacitly complicit with the attempt to exclude you will be ashamed enough to reform their behavior or the poor treatment will get much worse.  But since you are already considering cutting them off, I suppose that wouldn't be a huge issue.

707,"hey, you're not awful. you're not selfish. you hate being a mother, you don't hate your kids, you don't wanna hurt them, you worry that your feelings will affect them. 


you have every right to wish you could do the things you want. you're a totally normal person that wasn't cut out to be a mother. it's okay.


most parents, specially mothers, know they have very difficult moments when they hate having all the responsability. a lot of times having children is not happy or rewarding. sure, most people can see the brightside, but usually they just say how great and perfect everything is because it's what society led all of us to believe is ""right"".


all that said, the first thing you need to do is try to make more time for yourself. since you can't rely on the father, it is even more normal for you to hate being a mother. you have double the work. it's not fair.


do you have family, a close friend or a can pay a nanny to take care of them for you sometimes? i understand that your problem can't be solved just by having one quiet night for yourself every now and then, but it's a start.



secondly, i don't know how is the culture in your country, but where i live i had a lot of childhood friends living with their aunts and/or grandmas because their moms were ""busy"": some were working in another country, but some just didn't wanna raise their kids. if the culture/law allows it, do you have such a person? or, if you are divorced, could you leave the kids with your husband? (i'm guessing no, since you said he ""left"")


people criticize women for that, but there's plenty of men that do exactly the same (make sure their kids have a good home but wanna live their life as they want) and are considered good, caring fathers, just because they didn't completely leave.


if none of the above are options, i'm very sorry. it would be good for you to be on therapy, but i believe it would be very difficult to find a professional that can help you cope with that without being judgemental, specially if you live in a smaller and close-minded city.


i'll tell you again: you're not awful. you care for your children, you just wish you didn't have all this responsability. it's totally ok and there's plenty of other moms like you. your children won't be necessarily unhappy because of you and, luckly, you can find a way of not being unhappy either.


their father is awful. he's the one that left you with no income, taking care of 2 kids you didn't wanna have either. why is he the only one entitled to that? you should at least find a good lawyer and make him pay your kids what is their right.


also, keep in mind that most adults just can't go and do what they want, even if they're childless, because of work, financial reasons, having to take care of a elder etc.


and please, try to combine two contraceptive methods from now on, and do a pregnancy test if something is different as well.


i wish you the best of luck coming to terms with yourself, and finding a arrangement where you and your children can be happy."
708,"My only advise for you would be- If one of the family members or friends who had cut you off reaches out to you and offers you a true sincere apology for behavior, then to consider it. If its truly sincere, and you want to forgive, its okay to.

I would try to have another conversation with him and suggest that this isn't you asking for permission, it's trying to figure out what the next step is, because you're going after these jobs. 

You're young, so getting a pay boost now can really set you up for the future as well as paying of debt. If he doesn't want to come with you, then suggest you live separately for a fixed period of time before you re-evaluate.

When I left, I was gone for about 5 months before she decided to move down and we stayed another year. Doing so, with the extra money allowed us to move back to our ""home state"" with a bunch of money saved up and the easier commute and bigger house was great for the kids.

Your husband sounds like he's not being serious about wanting to move and just placating you with what you want to hear and now that you're actually planning it, he seems to be enacting made up rules that he thinks you won't be able to hit so that he won't have to say out loud ""Actually, I don't really want to move and I don't really care that you can't find a good job where we are. . . "" So talk to him and I'd suggest planning on going with or without him.

Holy racism, batman. I'm sorry you are hurting, but you dodged a bullet. The last thing you need is some girl with a BBC fetish making belittling comments about your body. She was not a keeper.

With time, you will hurt less. Be good to yourself, and hang in there.

Btw, 6.5"" is longer than average by a good inch."
723,"Before you move just try telling her flat out that her behaviour has made you uncomfortable in your home and you want her to stop talking to you. If/when she tries to guilt trip you tell her you're just someone who lives there, and you want to be left alone, and if she's that concerned about whatever it is perhaps she should see a professional, and leave it there. 

Then when she continues trying to talk to you, and she will to test how much you actually meant what you said and what she can get away with, you need to just repeat that you've already discussed this with her, that she's making you uncomfortable right now and you just want to be left alone, and keep walking. 

I think you're trying to find a nice, nonhurtful way to do this, but there isn't one. She isn't stable, her behaviour isn't normal, and you need to have and enforce strong boundaries in those situations and ignore guilt tripping and tears. 

It's also worth keeping a diary of any encounters with her and what happened. 

Edit: After reading over the other comments I just wanted to reemphasize that you need to choose an approach that makes it clear this is not a friendship in any way and you don't want one. A lot of people are suggesting things that sound much nicer, but that are too open ended for someone like this. You have to cut the idea that there is a friendship happening here or potentially happening here dead. 

I don't think you need to be cruel as some are suggesting, but I do think that what you think of as rude might be needed here to get your point across, polite phrases where understanding subtext is important to truly get the meaning are not going to get through here - she doesn't understand it for whatever reason. You need to tell her clearly what your boundary is, enforce that boundary when she tests it, and then just don't engage with her at all.   "
724,"&gt; They’re like sisters.

I think this is the issue. She grew up with his mother treating her like a sister by OP's own admission. She probably watched her son grow and viewed him like her own nephew, a second son by OP's own admission, even if they are not related by blood. She is probably also rightfully worried if there is a fall out how this will affect her relationship with her long time friend and someone she sees as a son. "
725,"I do. Instead of telling you what she was feeling and what she wanted in a clear, adult way (and yes, this can be accomplished even when a person is unclear about their own feelings) she dropped hints, made snide comments, and ultimately served up enough passive aggression to time a fight right before the trip, ensuring she had an excuse for you not to go. Once she got her way, she turned on the charm again so you didn't notice you'd been had."
726,If possible screenshot the text to show his girlfriend after you call them out on their shit. 
727,"&gt;The next day he went to an emergency psychiatrist appointment and enrolled in an anger management course. He told his friends what happened and asked to be held accountable for no more alcohol. He also went to an AA meeting and plans to continue going.

He doesn't need anger management. Because from your description, in the moments before he assaulted you, he wasn't out of his mind with anger. He wanted to control you. 

There is an old update from a legal advice thread that I just read: OP was stalking this girl and he realized that he was ultimately at fault and he needed to change his life. 

&gt;I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. **My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect.** Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors. I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again.

Your husband seems to be blaming the drinking and his anger issues for choking you, but he has deeper, uglier issues. 

Personally, I would advocate leaving him. You are not only responsible for yourself, but your child. Your home is not a safe place to be.

edited to add: 

&gt;I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program."
728,"&gt; ""my ex would have my back financially if I fail, I don't feel you would"" 

That's a pretty manipulative thing for her to say.  It kind of makes it sound that if she were to fail, she'd expect either her SO or her parents to bail her out.  That's not a good long-term financial plan.  However,  you're not living together, you don't share finances, you aren't engaged, 9-months isn't that long for a relationship.   But it sounds like this conversation spurred the end of the honeymoon phase for you two.

729,Thank you so much for not judging me. I’ll google now

732,"This is not a battle you'll win. You're not going to magically make her accept your porn use by using your powers of persuasion. Your only two choices are lie to he and keep secrets, or just be honest with her. However she reacts is however she reacts. "
733,"Thank you! I don't really interact with kids or parents much, honestly. So I wasn't really sure how to approach them. I appreciate your response!"
734,"&gt; Not only were you a victim but your brother likely was too, because I can almost guarantee you weren't his ex's only target.

Ok that's important too. I'm gonna talk to him tonight to make sure he's feeling alright and see if he wants to talk about this. It's now my turn to be the supportive sibling. "
735,"As someone who was your age and also got involved with an older man, I very much recommend that you don't do this."
736,You don't have friends you just know a bunch of assholes you call friends. What are they 12?? I can see on this trip with the new room rules maybe the last to join the group gets left off but the rest of it is just assholery. You need better friends. 
737,"&gt; He talked about moving in after only a month too

This is such a giant red flag.  OP, you really need to keep the brakes on this relationship.  Living together after 4 months is a big NO.   "
738,"Please make an appointment, make the time. It sounds like you are having some paranoid delusions and it should be mentioned to your mental health professional. "
739,"Also, the person you LOVE lost someone they LOVE. Emotions run by proxy, too."
740,"Yeah, nah. Super do NOT tell her she’s unattractive. That will just send her spiraling more. Frame it as a lifestyle revamping and come from a place of loving concern. Don’t be aggressive, but convey that her self-care is important to you and that it could be setting a bad example for your children if she neglects that. 

120lbs is really drastic. It’s not just a normal “getting older” thing. Check if her health is okay, or how she’s doing. Maybe it’s a thyroid thing even. Brains and bodies are weird, man. "
741,Maybe not mentioning that she is a virgin will help her game out x10

743,"I live in a HCOL area so I see a lot of couples like this, and what it boils down to is any of these: (1) the higher earner is comfortable with the fact that they are essentially subsidizing their partner's lifestyle and will be doing so indefinitely, (2) the couple live as though they were both earning what the lower earner makes (e.g. living a long way out, with roommates, not traveling, etc.), or (3) the higher earner finds a partner who is able to more closely match income.

As for how to think about it - well, how could this play out in a way that would make you happy? I'm kind of wondering if the issue is actually that deep down you want her to get a non-freelancing job that earns more money, and I think the only way to deal with that is to just... have an honest conversation with her about the financial situation and what your goals are. Does she share those goals? Has she thought about the fact that they are unreachable given the current set-up? You're acting as though you have shared finances, but it's clear you don't *feel* like sharing finances with her, and that's something you need to talk about. It's okay not to want to subsidize your partner to this degree, but if that's the case the relationship may not continue to work... so you should talk about it with her. She needs to know how frustrated you are so that the two of you can try to come up with solutions as a team, or decide that it's not going to work out. But you can't just keep being resentful and hoping that you will find a solution on your own, because financially you can't: the numbers just don't work. "
744,"Idk. You don’t really respect her. You don’t really like her. You’re already thinking about her as a weight you’ll have to carry when you retire. You don’t think she’s worth the effort for sex. 
Sounds like you’ve made u your mind. If you can’t handle her saying silly things during conversations and if you’re so upset she pouted when you put up a sign and you can’t even put in the effort to show her physical affection, I don’t know what to tell you "
745,"&gt;I would've found a cheap-ish hotel, parked my butt on the beach, not spoken to her for two weeks and said ""sup?"" on the return plane with a tan.

This made me LOL"
746,He wants to have sex with you. I've known a bunch a twins and confusion like for has never ever happened
747,"&gt; you apologize to your son for letting her bullshit slide all these years

OP should be thankful his son is a better person than both his parents combined. If my father stood silent about my own mother's homophobia for 11 year I would have cut them both out of my life long ago. "
748,Self harm can take lots of different shapes. This is one of em.
749,Thank you. I needed to be reminded of that 
750,"So not long ago my girlfriend was sexually assaulted by her friends friend. Her friend tried to pull the ""well we weren't in the room and can't know"" and continued to be friends with the guy. Fuck him and fuck that shit. Your boyfriend shouldn't defend that type of behavior. Good on you for making it clear to that guy that that shit isn't okay. "
751,"Wow, sounds like youre married to a petulant 14 year old...honestly, Id go without him. If people ask where he is, Id tell them very honestly ""Oh, hes home playing the new expansion pack of WoW"", and just watch the eyebrows raise. 

Does he often act more like a child than a husband, or is this the only time he does this (and not a weekly behavior)? Do you also do all of the housework, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.?"
752,"120 pounds gained is certainly nothing to scoff at... that's not just affecting your attraction (which is important) but it's also serious affecting her health regardless of whether she realizes it or ""feels"" it. 

She literally gained another person worth of weight. And yeah, telling her that you're not attracted to her because of the weight gain likely isn't going to go well, but there is a *chance* it could put her on the right path to losing it. And if the alternative is either divorce or just sucking it up and letting her health and life go to waste while you can hardly maintain an erection in bed, then some hurt feelings seem worth it. 

I'm sure it can be hard to get to the gym when you have kids, but like they say, weight loss starts in the kitchen. Hell, it can end in the kitchen if you watch your eating habits carefully. Exercise is awesome, but her diet is what needs the most work here. 

"
753,"My tip. Do not try to convince her the Bible is wrong. I think that won't get you anywhere. Focus on attending doesn't mean she doesn't have real concerns about it.

I'd, very gently, remind her you *are* attending and hope she joins you. No reason to fight.

She might not agree to go until the morning of the wedding.

I'd also tell your son to not have ""if anyone objects"" line."
754,"Thanks! I started working when I was 14 but my biggest source would probably be this book translating job (Chinese to English) that I got when I was 18 (I'm still doing it now). I was paid $10k per book by a Chinese publishing company. I'm super thankful for that opportunity. 

My boyfriend definitely makes VERY dumb financial decisions. This is something I really need to seriously bring up with him. If he still doesn't get it then I think my best bet is to break up with him. "
755,"I wouldn't be ok with it at all. Occasionally, no big deal... twice a week? There's something off about this situation. "
756,"You should all meet up with her, bring some beer and food and ice cream, and L should tell her what he heard and what you all know. 


I am totally against interventions, but she has to know. Don't watch her getting strung along.


Even if she really doesn't want to get married any more and doesn't want to have kids, she should not be a backup plan for that douchebag of a cheater.


Tell her you love her and you will be there for her, no matter what, but that you had to let her know. You would wish for the same if the positions were reversed.


Chances are are that she doesn't want to acknowledge it, but at lrast you tried.


People have to want to get out of shitty relationships, though. You can't force them."
757,"Double check landlord/tenant laws in Tennessee. See if there are any provisions for if a landlord is harassing a tenant or making up ridiculous rules. If you can find anything that could apply to what he is doing, consider taking steps that could bring you closer to moving out. You would have to document everything in writing and save receipts of any harassment you receive. Your landlord may or may not take you to court for breaking your lease so be prepared to prove that the landlord nullified the lease first with his actions. 

If you can’t break your lease I suggest finding a coffee shop or library to hang out in a lot. Ignore any contact from your landlord about Facebook or anything that isn’t specifically about your lease. "
758,"Bearded guy here.

It's ok to have preferences.  You can be body positive without being attracted to everything and everyone.  It's not hypocritical at all.  Just date the beardless dudes that you wanna, and stop beating yourself up about it."
759,"It would be fine if she was just venting (I guess), but she is really trying to uproot this little girl for her petty bs! If the dad never wanted to pursue full custody, and the little girl is happy as she is, wtf is your friend’s problem? If everyone was happy with the arrangement and the child is well adjusted, what is going on here? Is it some weir thing where, if she can get custody, she can pretend the ex does not exist more easily? I am just boggled that your friend is doing this as the expense of the actual bio parents (who, until she came along were happy with this) and at the expense of the child, just so she can “win.” What does that say about your friend!"
760,"She is always at home, so it’s tricky. Every time their front door closes, we look to see if it’s just him leaving, so my husband can talk to him. Haven’t had a good opportunity yet. But not giving up. I feel like he deserves to know. The guy she’s been with is a friend of theirs. He’s actually at the house with both of them right now. It’s just tough. I feel badly for him. "
761,"I'm really puzzled by these replies, guys. We read so much garbage behavior here--abuse, stealing, cheating, secret families, stalking. This isn't any of this. He's not even asking if they should break up. Why is sitting down and talking about their relationship expectations and her insecurities a terrible thing? We have no clue what's making her this way. Has she been cheated on in the past? Is she just an immature baby? We don't know. 

Not to mention, if she was writing in about her *anxiety* at being away from her BF with some big background on past relationships, we would encourage her to sit him down and-gasp!-talk to him. 

My initial instinct, I stand by. Passive-aggressive ish has no place in an adult relationship."
762,"If you do stay maybe put a nix on the scaring each other.

For good."
763,"Yeah, you're right.   OP being there is a big reminder that her life is no fairy tale.  Her ""romantic older man"" is a scummy cheater with an existing family to which he has emotional (and other?) obligations.  And, this paragon of critical thinking probably looks at the daughter and thinks ""competition.""  Competition for attention, resources, etc.  And also a weird reminder that he might be looking at other 19 -26 year olds with a leering eye.  OP's friends, perhaps?  And if GF is starting to feel insecure about her looks once the pregnancy weight starts..... Well, good thing she and Baby Daddy are such a secure footing with each other, right?  Right?  Oh, I think I hear crickets.... "
764,"I think the meat of your speech should be about how great they are as a couple. That despite your initial reservations, you came around to see that he brings out the best in her, treats her as she deserves, makes her happy, etc. Also, run your entire speech by your daughter. If she's ok with this angle, then go for it."
765,"Teacher and parent here!

\&gt;WTF do I say at parent/teacher night?

The same things you would if you'd never met this teacher.

\&gt;Do I tell my ex-wife?

No. 

\&gt;Do I tell my girlfriend?

If you wish.

\&gt;Tell the kids?

Wtf NO. That is so inappropriate.

\&gt;Does the teacher remember me?

Probably, but so what? If you run into a former sex partner at, say, a wedding or on the street, you don't announce to your date and kids that they're a former sex partner. You just be friendly and polite and pretend it never happened.

It's a little awkward for you, but telling anyone other than your girlfriend is going to make EVERYONE uncomfortable."
766,"Father of two here. 

Any man who doesn’t put his needs behind those in his children while they are infants had poor priorities. 

You  need some attention for sure.  But right before the newborn arrives is a horrible time.   Even worse he seems to be trying to say his wife should put as much attention to her career as she did before which isn’t even his concern. "
767,"It sounds like everyone in your household is overwhelmed. Most likely the daughter is acting out because there’s a new baby and she doesn’t have her own space where she can de-escalate. It also sounds like you and your husband had been trying to quiet a crying baby for a very long time, only for the crying to keep starting because of the rambunctious daughter.

Was pushing your daughter acceptable? No
Was screaming at her acceptable?
No

But I can understand why it happened. It sounds like he was feeling extremely overwhelmed and frustrated and snapped because he was overstimulated and exhausted. You all really need to work on creating separate spaces. Even if it means daughter gets the bedroom and you and husband sleep on an air mattress in the living room. Humans are social but they need private space. Especially your three year old daughter or she is going to continue to act out and bedtime will remain a nightmare.

Try to have a calm conversation with your husband and don’t hold onto to anger. It does no good. Discuss what options you both can take when you feel yourself getting increasingly upset. He doesn’t sound like a bad guy. He sounds like a stressed one that made a mistake."
768,This is a better post than I originally thought it would be. 
769,"Your friend may not be that nice of a person, OP. Besides the chaos she is trying to cause, you realize they are stepping in after the baby years, the toddler years, and all of that? They bypassed the sleepless nights, terrible twos, shots, potty training, and now that Ava is “fun” and more self sufficient as an elementary aged kid, want to take credit for the heavy lifting and step in *now*?"
770,So you'd rather his actions dictate when you can and cannot sleep?
771,"You say walls are paper thin...

Why don't you just say out loud ""it's much nicer now that her husband is back isn't it? We don't have to hear her loud sex with random strangers anymore!""

He might hear... "
772,"Absolutely understandable OP that you don’t want to drive in bad weather but  to help you overcome some of your fears I would recommend looking into some defensive driving courses. 

Honestly being a super nervous driver can be just as dangerous as an aggressive one in some circumstances. I say this as someone who has done defensive driving for work where the instructor highlighted that I was often too passive and not confident enough when it came to things like roundabouts (UK based). Hesitating unnecessarily can easily lead to shunting accidents."
773,"Full stop, he’s a perv. None of this sounds accidental. 

I was friends with identical twins growing up, they were even going for some Guiness Book of World Records thing and they dressed the same the entire time I knew them.   We weren’t close friends but I could tell the difference easily just by talking to them. This guy is a pig. "
774,"What you don't understand is that behaving this way makes him feel good and he enjoys it. He does not do it because you have done anything ""wrong."" On the contrary even if you behaved ""perfect"" he would get even madder because you would be making it harder for him to find an excuse to do it to you. If only you could have seen my ex storming around the house, getting madder and madder, *because I had made things ""perfect"" in all the ways he claimed to want* and there was absolutely nothing he could find to berate me about. That alone made him furious! He literally searched from room to room looking for ANYTHING wrong and was losing his shit because there was nothing wrong.

It's highly pleasurable for your boyfriend to lash out on you this way. The reason he does it to you and not others is because you are the only one who will take it from him. As far as the change in him, it's very very typical that abuse Begins for the first time after a major relationship milestone that makes it harder for the other person to leave. Did you notice an increase in this Behavior after you had your daughter? Are you working right now or is he bringing in the most money? Did you notice an increase in this Behavior after you started relying on him for money?

There is nothing you can do to make him ""understand"" he is hurting you because he understands perfectly well. He is just doing it because it is pleasurable for him. He would do it to others too if he could get away with it. 

The only time I think he would pretend to be nicer is if it started looking like he didn't have you locked down and you were able to leave. Like if you got a job or made more money and you clearly had real options, and he noticed that you were starting to plan for leaving. I think he would act sweet until he got you committed and dependent again and then he could treat you again the way that gives him pleasure."
775,"Closeness is relative. In my world, bathing with a platonic friend is pretty unusual, but different people have different thresholds of intimacy. It doesn't mean your friendship is wrong or aberrant.

Google ""romantic friendship."" What you're describing hearkens to those kinds of relationships, which by and large don't exist/are no longer considered socially acceptable in Western culture."
776,"Sounds like you would be just fine on your own to be frank. You are still putting in work having to remind him of everything while he doesn’t even do it. Not to mention the stress, and being the breadwinner. He’s too comfortable getting away with doing absolutely nothing. For all you know he’s purposefully forgetting/messing things up so you don’t expect more from him. He’s not really making himself an asset nor is he showing any respect or understanding for you or your relationship. I can understand your frustration. I would feel very used by that point. And like his mother, which will kill a sex life faster than anything else. "
777,"(F21) I would feel so fucking betrayed to even know another girl was sleeping next to my partner every weekend. That's so fucked up on her part, you deserve better! I wouldn't be surprised if she's cheated and is lying about that too. If they were sexual and my partner was still seeing her, id break it off immediately. Not only did she go behind your back, she gaslighted you to make you feel like YOU were crazy and YOU were the problem. Not cool, not okay. She's definitely in the wrong on this one. Im sorry you're having to go through this. Break it off with her and tell her she can keep the damn bed."
778,Even if she is concerned for your health and concerned that you have an eating disorder it is very unkind to tell your entire family that you have anorexia.  If you did have anorexia (which it does not sound like you do) it would be damaging to your relationship to share that information with others without your consent.  I am sorry you are going through that and congratulations on your achievement!
779,"&gt; If your mother who was born in the first quarter of the last century was supportive,

To be fair she's what I would call a convert to the sexual revolution. She was already a mother of six when she read *The Feminine Mystique* and in many ways was more of a ""flower mother"" than a flower child. My father once had to bail her out of jail when I was fourteen and she was arrested protesting the Vietnam War, and she made signs to demonstrate in favor of *Roe v Wade* (a fact I never shared with my wife). I swear if she were closer to my age she would have hitched a ride to Woodstock and joined a commune in the late '60s and early '70s. "
780,"This, for all they knew he could have been accused of theft or embezzlement or something. Why immediately jump to sexual assault if someone didn't tell them something?"
781,"She deserves to be with someone who will love and cherish and respect her. She deserves to be with someone who enjoys her kooky non sequiturs. She deserves to be with someone who finds her sexually attractive. She deserves to be with someone who doesn't think of her as a burdensome safety blanket. You're holding her back from finding the person out there who will genuinely treasure her.

And equally you deserve to be with someone who you find exciting and engaging and insightful and attentive. Staying in this relationship is holding you both back from finding proper happiness."
782,"I wouldn't take advice from your dad, he obviously doesn't have very good decision making capabilities.

Take a step back from your interactions with them. Scale back your visits with your dad to once a week or less.

Your interactions with her are likely strained for a few reasons.

 If she has a conscience, she probably feels guilty for her part in the destruction of your family. She is probably also scared that your dad will leave her *when* he gets the next ex student he is sleeping with pregnant. She likely feels nervous about how she will handle a kid.

Just give them space, and limit your interactions to your dad."
783,"Honestly, if someone grabbed *his* butt would he go to OP so she could deal with it herself? I really doubt it."
784,"Her attitude probably isn’t about you. It is about the fact that she feels weird and insecure about the whole situation.  I would try to be civil and polite, but you don’t have any obligation to make her like you. If anything, it should be your dad’s responsibility to facilitate you getting to know one another. He’s the one who put you all in this situation. "
785,"I would tell her to stop, or you will leave.  Then follow through.  Eating brunch at a nice restaurant?  Bye!  Out shopping?  Bye!  You basically have to train her that those comments have consequences.  She will learn to keep her mouth shut.  Time to draw a line in the sand.  One side is a healthy relationship, and the other side is her alone.  "

He acts grumpy but I just don’t let it turn into a fight anymore. We used to be in your position and I would go along and be miserable the whole time. Finally I just started stating what I would be doing while he was with his parents and we’ve stopped fighting about it because I don’t ask if it’s ok with him or if it bothers him.

Even if he leaves his wife and kids for her he is more than likely going to do the same thing to her one day. It sounds like he has cheated before as well. She is crazy to continue with Kevin, you have every right to hate it based on your past, and if you want to walk away from it all you should."
794,"Why though? Your ex calls your wife names just randomly and you let it happen? And what about your son, you must be in frequent contact with your ex because of him, how does your wife deal with that?  I'm not saying your wife's reactions are normal, but this sounds like the latest in a long string of serious issues, and I wonder whether it's all in your wife's head entirely, or she's been triggered by past events. As for you, why are you so protective of your ex's facebook of all things? Let your wife have at it if that will make her feel better, your ex's social media have nothing to do with you. "
795,"On top of this, women aren’t products you put money into and get love in return. It’s not like anyone was forcing OP to spend almost all his disposable income on this girl. Spending money should be for fun things, not a tool to say “look how good I am to her”. Lesson learned the hard way"

799,"Just because someone is unwell / has anxiety doesn't give them the right to completely ignore and disrespect your privacy and boundaries. Just because someone is upset and crying doesn't make them right and you wrong. You need to lose this guy yesterday. I'm glad you're breaking up with him because everything else seems to come before your feelings, your security, your privacy, your mental health. It's not good for either of you and he needs help before he gets into another relationship he's not prepared to handle like a respectful adult. "
800,"Well, now the question you've gotta ask yourself is why on Earth would you want to stay with a dude who looks at female sexuality like his personal plaything to manipulate and toss about as he pleases? "
801,"Personally, I think you're sharing too much information with the whole hiring a PI. It's fine if it's between you 2, but you're sharing this in front of family, friends, maybe co-workers.

Just keep it light."
802,Why do you feel like your husband should make this financial decision alone?
803,"^^^^This.... If he's talking with other girls, he feels a little guilty, so he's turning that guilt into suspicion of your actions.
Not a healthy relationship."
804,"She's not your wife, she doesn't really have a right to demand you answer her on her schedule. Tell her outright that your phone gives you anxiety (you are not alone in this so don't let her make you feel bad about it) and that you'll answer when you are able to. If she can't handle that then maybe this isn't a friendship the two of you want to continue to invest in."
805,Absolutely agree with this. Spend precious time with your mom. It's the right choice. Don't stress out your pregnancy. Ditch the selfish friend and look after your own needs.
806,"&gt; So I emailed the RA.

Now you escalate to showing up in person or calling. You tell them directly, clearly and honestly that you cannot continue to live with this person. You ask politely for alternate living arrangements. "
807,Please report the group to Facebook and the university. This should absolutely not be tolerated by either of them. 
808,"&gt;My brothers and other sister have spent our lives treading on egg shells around her.

That pretty much says it all.  You and your siblings have spent a lifetime enabling her insensitivity.  She doesn't care that you may have been hurt and if you try to bring it up, she will just double-down.  She will never understand your hurt.  

Let your other siblings know about the call (which BTW was deliberately timed to bring you down from a happiness high) to give them a heads up about your going low contact with Sis for a bit.  After a few weeks, you'll appreciate not having to be involved with her and can pass the peacemaker role to someone else."
809,"If you find it infuriating it is still working (to a degree). You didn't upset this type of person. It's stress on an unstable structure. If you actually want to offer them kindness you could say ""is there someone I should call for you? You seem very upset.""

You aren't responsible for other people's emotions and this tactic works because people are trying to clear their conscience, not be kind."
810,"OP, if one person in a relationship spends recklessly, they hold the financial power. They will repeatedly run towards the cliff edge, and you will need to repeatedly save them (and you) from falling. This means that reckless spender often gets what they want with little consequence, while the prudent person will have to give up their own plans and play financial rescue.

Be very clear to your partner that you don't intend to finance their fancy car or fancy guitars. If this doesn't work, well then you probably need to find someone who can handle finance and wants kids."
811,Pls post this in r/survivinginfidelity as they have lots of first hand experience. Expect blunt answers over there. There is a lot of wisdom shared. 
812,"It sounds like she was never that invested in your relationship (or she wanted to have a side relationship) and you have now broken up for good. 

This is more than violated trust. She was actively cheating on you. Do you really believe that all they do is watching TV in bed? He's not an ex-fling. He is (one of) her sexual partner. 

Edit: OP, please seek therapy and reach out to your friends. You aren't a burden, and I'm sure all your friends and family love you and would be happy to be a source of emotional support. Feel free to message me (or other people) if you're feeling down. Don't kill yourself ): none of this is your fault. "

814,"""My douchebag boyfriend tries to control my behavior and is a big-ass hypocrite that cuts me out when I engage in the same behavior he does.  What should I do?""

It depends.  Here is a decision tree:

""I have self-respect"":  Dump him and any future pigs and hold yourself and your boyfriends to high (and equal) standards.

""I have no self-respect"":  Stay in the relationship."
815,"“Maybe I love you, maybe I don’t. What matters? I love ME. I value ME. It’s time I reminded myself. Full stop”

Stop taking YOU for granted. "
816,"Something about this update makes me feel uncomfortable. I’ll sum it up as this: both of you are surrounded by people who are making decisions for you. 

And when you have kids, and every other milestone forward, do not be surprised that they do the exact same thing. 

Please keep going to therapy. "

819,She absolutely took advantage of you. She doesnt want anything serious with you. She wants a plaything whe can play with when shes bored but ignore when she doesnt want to deal with it. That's why she freaked out about Hawaii. She doesnt want to wake up with you everyday - that freaks her out. She wants to do awesome things on her own and then call you when shes bored with those things. 
820,"But even if they were indistinguishable, if I made the mistake once I would be on HYPER alert not to do it again. I would be so mortified I would be extra cautious not to do it again. 

The fact he keeps “accidentally” doing it, even if they’re so hard to tell apart, shows he’s not even trying at best, or intentionally doing it at worst. 

I vote the latter. Total creep. "
821,"I can't get over ""boarding on gay."" That probably has as much, if not more, to do with his lack of intimicy and romantic interest in you as your health. He's just not into you, and for whatever reason doesn't have the guts to break up with you. You should take the plunge for both of you, your relationship is dead."
822,"Dude, she punched someone in the face for talking to you; there were definitely red flags here. I know you're hurting, and I know how much it sucks and I'm sorry you're having to go through this right now, but this breakup is definitely for the best. "

824,"Not the person you're responding to, but the 20/month would have you paying 50/50 without sacrificing a lifestyle.

It sounds like this may not be the relationship for you. Let me break it down for you another way. Your girlfriend is making $24k/year, which is pretty much near the poverty line. ESPECIALLY in an expensive area. You make $120k/year post-tax.

Here's the thing. ""Living like an adult"" at a six-figure take home salary looks much different than ""Living like an adult"" near the poverty line. 

In any case, adjustments need to be made to your current status quo because she's barely keeping her head above water now and you're looking at mortgages."

826,"Yep. This is pretty much all there is to say. His behavior is not reasonable at all. Sounds like maybe he is frustrated/disappointed and is taking it out on OP, but that’s not fair at all."
827,"Your mother would not approve for the same reasons that most people here are telling you:  Normal, healthily adjust 25-year old men do not look to 16-year old girls for companionship.  In the vast majority of cases, such men are looking to manipulate and exploit young women into completely messed up relationships. 

Do not be flattered when he says that you are ""mature for your age"", or not like other girls your age.   He is counting on using such flattery to convince you to go behind your mom's back. He's already made you think that your friendship is special enough for you to contemplate lying to your mom.  And we can guarantee you that he will not two years to break the law,  He'll have you convinced that the law is meaningless in your case

Get out of this spider's web right now.  Stop chatting with him on breaks and do not date him at all.   Just dial it back and pay more attention to other boys your age."

829,He gets off on having power over other people. You need to leave. 
830,"Ugh. I was S in a very similar relationship. While he did eventually consider me 'life partner' material, he never wanted to get married or have kids. I could see him bragging about having 'conditioned' me to accept it over drinks, back then.

I never gave up on marriage and kids in my 30's. We fought...horrible fights...throughout my 40's over marriage and kids.   He never told me outright he didn't want kids. It was 'we need more money in the bank' 'better jobs' 'better health insurance' 'fix up the house to be safe for kids'. Obviously, looking back now, he was totally trying to run my clock out. I couldn't see it then.

If my friends guy had heard him out in a bar bragging about how he was stringing me along? I could only hope to have a friends group as great as yours sit me down and have an intervention. I needed something to give me a kick in the arse. I was struggling, and didn't really have anyone giving me solid advice.

""Ditch the loser' and 'find someone else' is a bitter pill to swallow when you're 31 and have been with someone for years. She may feel it's 'too late' to start over and find someone new in time to have kids, so why bother? (I 100% felt that way when I was 32 and desperate for a baby) She may also feel she would never find anyone else as compatible with her as her guy. 

Heck, show her this post and my reply. I turned 47 last week. I'm struggling to accept my life choices. I replay the 'why did I DO that?!"" in my mind, over and over, wanting to be able to go back and change it. I missed my chance to get married. To have my Dad walk me down an aisle. To be pregnant and hold my baby in the 'normal' time frame. To watch my parents be grandparents to my kids as they grew. Time I can never get back. 

I tried several different therapists. They all say that, by my actions, I chose my partner over being a wife and Mom. So to go home and work on my relationship. Blah blah blah. I feel like I was sleepwalking back then, and recently woke up after a 15 year long nap. Wish I had had some friends like you guys to slap me awake long ago.

She may not believe you. She may make excuses. But you will have planted the seed. She'll never end up like me 10 years later, asking ""Why didn't any of you say anything!?"" and ""I was struggling so much back then, I felt too old to start over, I was -miserable-"" Anyhow, this is getting wordy, so,

TL;DR - Tell her. Plant the seeds of doubt. Even if she doesn't listen right now, down the line, she will remember that conversation, and it may help her. You guys are good friends."
831,"Immediately take a portion of any food you have eaten within the last 12 hours and place it in clean tupperware. Take it with you to the hospital. Tell them exactly what happened, warn them that you're concerned it might have been done deliberately by someone who is aware of your allergy. What happens is a police detective will come down and talk to you about the situation. If they think it's serious, they'll take the food and send it for testing. Then it's a matter of waiting. If the food was contaminated, your sister will probably be arrested and charged since deliberately exposing someone to an allergen that can cause serious harm is a crime. 

Yes, you should do this. There's a reason that it is a crime. If she is willing to expose you to an allergen that can illicit a reaction because your husband *didn't leave you* and you have the nerve to *not fight with her about her actions?* The woman's a danger. You're safer if she's properly handled through the criminal justice system. At the very least, they could compel psychological testing and get you a restraining order."
832,"IF OP intends to go this route it would be a lot easier for the four year old if dad left the home then if four year old had to move and was away from dad. If they are going to do some time apart for dad to work on getting help, dad should be the one staying with a friend or family as that is less traumatic for his child who would at least still have his familiar home, room, and toys. 

Unless OP is planning to be in hiding or something. To be clear I am not advocating for this approach, I really don't feel I have the education or personal knowledge about the violence side of the situation to give any advice on that. "
833,"Run.  She's telling you that she isn't self-sufficient AND that she'll expect you to (financially) support her when she fails.

835,"It's not just five minutes when you get anxious around people.  It's replaying the interaction over and over again on a loop in your brain, it's cringing even **more** every time you hear a rustle from next door, because the idea of having to deal with the awkwardness is even more unbearable than the discomfort they were experiencing before.  I think I'm kind of like OP - given the choice, I'd always prefer to be uncomfortable myself given the choice between that and making other people uncomfortable.  That, somehow, makes me even MORE uncomfortable than I was in the first place.  


Now I'm not saying that any of this is right or healthy - far from it.  I'm just trying to explain why someone might consider moving over this.  "
836,What truly bewilders me is the fact that we've never tried to force our beliefs on each other. Every year on election day we joke about how we're cancelling out each other's votes. She's never had a problem with me getting a Big Mac on the way home from work on a Friday in Lent. She's never bugged me to go to Mass because she knows I converted in order to marry her. Now she's insisting that I not go to my own son's wedding and I insist that I shall. 
837,"People who love you don't then turn around and fuck someone else.

&gt;  He claims to love me and that he doesn't want our child in day care and wants to have me taking care of our home while he works. 

No, he wants you at home raising his child because he knows without your own income you will be fully dependant on him and he can continue to party and sleep around while you wait at home for him. 

You are a 23 year old adult woman with a child, you don't need his permission to leave, you don't need his permission to get a job, you don't need his permission to get your life back. 

&gt;  but I don't look at him the same, I just see someone who chose to sleep around and steamroll me into doing things I wasn't sure I wanted to do.

Then leave. 

OP you keep bringing up what HE wants, but what do YOU want to do with your life? "
838,"Thanks for this. This came up about 3 weeks ago. We spent about 6 days/nights in a row together. We jokingly said that we should call off work the next day.. but I said 'haha yeah that would be great, but I also do not think it's really a bad thing to have a day or two apart. I think when we spend a day or two apart it makes seeing each other the next time more special and fresh, don't you?' She was just silent from there and has been holding it against me since. She tells me it makes her feel more hesitant even after I explained it the way I did."
839,"What colour is your dress? Could you wear white gloves? Cuz nothing is waspier than white gloves.

Hit up some vintage stores. You'll want ones that only go to your wrist or just past. Anything longer than that would be evening gloves and would be too glamorous for a wedding. 

I get the impulse everyone has to rebel, but if you are not used to standing up to ""High Wasps"" and combating their particular type of subtle insults, you're not going to win. (and you've already kind of lost because your BF is freaking) - just cover up for the ceremony and drinks, take em off for the dinner. By then everyone will be drunk and much easier to deal with. "
840,"The bullshit part of this is that she was clearly job hunting for a bit, and I'm not sure why the goal posts weren't established ahead of time.

But I think the 'rule' or guiding principle is actually sound imo... If a couple is making 100k collectively in City X, it's a huge risk to move to city B when you'd only be getting 70k collectively until the other partner finds a job. I think if it was as easy as just transferring his job to the new city, OP would have mentioned it. 
"
841,"First you say you promised her you would never look at it, then you say she accepted it was something you had to use in certain situations. Which is it?

It sounds like porn is a dealbreaker to her. Regardless of how you or the rest of everyone else feels about how silly that may be, it is absolutely crucial her partner does not partake and that is her final decision.

If you want to watch porn, you're going to have to find a relationship with someone who accepts that. If she doesn't want her partner to watch porn, then she is going to have to find a relationship where the guy can accept that too."
842,"Not to be insensitive but I'm curious to see why your friend thought this would be a good idea. Is he as ""naive"" as your girlfriend?"
843,"Anytime a partner threatens to hit you is a good enough reason to reconsider the relationship. Lack of trust is another.

With that said... 

""psycho"", ""mental"", ""irrational"" 

are all phases men use to throw a women that when its easier to call her names and downplay her emotions, rather then address them and treat her like a person. As someone with that kind of experience I wouldn't be surprised if there is some deep resentment your wife has toward the way you treat her when she's angry and she's frustrated that her anger just gets a ""your crazy"" by her own husband. I bet there's something more going on here that you'd rather not say. "
844,"Your parents are awful people - I'm so sorry.

&gt;My parents say I acted like a child

So here's the thing: you *are* a child, which means your parents' concern should be with you, and it worries me that it's not purely because this girl is beautiful. Your parents have let you down big time, and I'm going to be bold here and say this isn't the first time your parents have marginalised your feelings? If it is, then my apologies, but normally this kind of behaviour doesn't happen in isolation.

Considering what your brother's ex said and how she behaved generally while they were together, I think you handled this in the most mature way possible. You didn't force them to break up; you spoke to your brother, he confronted her about what she has been subjecting you to for a while and they broke up because it appears she thought she was entirely within her right to bully you. Your brother did the right thing, and you're not at fault for their break up - at all - so try to stop worrying.

I'm just sad for you that your parents don't recognise this, because they should be the ones reassuring you here, not internet strangers. Not only were you a victim but your brother likely was too, because I can almost guarantee you weren't his ex's only target. "
845,"You’re 25. Move out. You’re talking like she has a responsibility to take care of you and provide. You’re 25. Get your own place.

Edit to add: I see that you’ve added a note about being poor and not intending to move out. Why in the hell do you think that this woman has an obligation to take care of you? She doesn’t. She would be in her right to kick you out at any time, and given how you’re acting, I would anticipate that time being sooner rather than later. Your whole intention here seems to be sponging off of her and dictating how she is in her own home. Good luck with that."
846,"I don't know, I can't help but imagine that, if the girlfriend had come here asking for advice after getting the positive STD test results, this is almost exactly the reaction that most of us would have recommended. Nothing about it seemed like an overreaction to me until it was revealed that the test results were inaccurate. 

That's not to say that OP is in the wrong, his feelings are totally valid. If I were in his shoes, I'd feel similarly. ""How come I don't get the benefit of the doubt versus the test results on a piece of paper?"" This is a case of two people who feel betrayed, in different ways. 

Ultimately, there are two reactions to consider. Her initial reaction, which was certainly forceful, and the way she reacted when she found out she had been wrong. I think OP needs to put as much stock in the latter reaction as the former. "
847,"Don't delete anything.  Take pictures, explain what the situation is, and be on your way with it.  You think she is a nice person, and you are witnessing bad things happen to her.  While you have zero obligation to do anything about it, you said yourself that you'd want to know, so do the thing that is right to you and let her know.

Tell the guy NOTHING. "
848,"It's reasonable for your boyfriend not to want to spend so much time in transit, but it's pretty unreasonable for him to ask MULTIPLE people to come to another city instead. Why doesn't he have his own friends and social life in his city? Why would he automatically be sitting sadly at home if he didn't go out with you? 

I'd carve out a day or two that are just for the two of you, and plan to spend them at his place. The rest of the time, he's just going to have to decide if he'd rather hang out or get some rest at home on a case-by-case basis. And that's really not a hardship. "
849,Yep and it’s almost down to jealousy. You’ve achieved something awesome and they haven’t.

851,"&gt;She's normally really shy


She got naked for a mutual male friend. 


I'm thinking she might not be as shy as you think."
852,"So, yes, I agree with most people that she's probably being unreasonable.  HOWEVER, I think this isn't a ""I'm against your Independence, how dare you do this without me!"" thing, but more of a, ""I also want to travel with you to exotic places and home visits to my country don't count because that's not 'foreign' to me.""

Instead of telling her she's being unreasonable, tell her that you want to know if it's more of a problem with you traveling with guys somewhere without her OR if it's just that she wants to go somewhere exotic with you that isn't ""home"" for her?

If it's the last one, you can have your cake and eat it too because all you have to do is say, ""Okay, so this is a 'let's have more adventures in cool places' issue, not a 'no friends or separate vacations issue.'"" Then tell her when your next slice of vacation time is (or plan your schedules together for the next one) and let her pick a place that is cool for her to visit.  Preferably a place that isn't her home country. 

She probably just wants some memories of you two exploring a new place together for the first time (and pictures.  So many pictures) instead of one or the other being a ""guide"" in a place they've already been."
853,"also lol @ grinding. he was yelling this to me - and i also had to try to stop laughing.

i actually use to be quite suspicious when i was younger as i was insecure and he was older and more certain of himself. i really don't think he is the cheating type. i just find it so odd this change in his behaviour. he has let me gone on many girls trips and clubbing to all hours of the morning. the only thing that has been a massive change is now i am a mother and his family friend cheating scandal."
854,"&gt; He says, “You don’t appreciate how hard I work.” I say, “Yes, I do. I’m very proud of your accomplishments. I rub your back at night and fix your lunch because I love you and appreciate you.” So he says, “Well if you hate it so much don’t do it then since I’m such a piece of shit.” In the end, I get so confused I don’t even know what we’re arguing about anymore.

Yeah, that's the goal. He changes the subject, puts you on the defensive, and ta da, he no longer has to talk about how he doesn't do shit around the house.

First of all, stop framing this as him helping you around the house or helping you with the kids. He lives there, and they are his kids. He needs to participate in the chores and parent the kids. It's called being a grown up.

When you have these discussions, don't let him change the subject. Say something like, ""I hear that you don't feel appreciated. Right now, I want to talk about getting chores done around the house,"" which sounds a little cold, so maybe work on that a little. Basically, acknowledge what he said, but don't respond to it. Turn the subject back to doing chores (not helping!). 

How to make him feel appreciated is a separate discussion. This is sort of a nuclear option, but when he says stuff like, ""You think I'm a shit,"" agree with him. Those comments are designed to make you defend yourself. Don't. If you don't want to go full nuclear, you can things like, ""I'm not going to address that.""

And don't ever use the words ""help me"" again. "
855,"&gt; if she was desperate enough to contact me on there then it must be serious 

I'd love to know what might fall into this bracket. Trapped down a well? Terrorist attack? **She's your ex.** If things have become toxic enough between you to block her anywhere, it's bad enough to block her **everywhere.** And if she's sending you anything awful enough to warrant an apology and admission she went too far...why do you want to keep someone capable of that in your life? The future reconciliation ship has long since sailed. Either she said something awful, or she noticed she was blocked and is just making this up as some sort of attention seeking exercise. How is it even possible to send something to someone who's blocked you on Instagram? If they can still see your account that seems to defy the point. Regardless, ignore her, block her number, grow up and move on with your life."
856,"Oh, I am SO pleased for you!"
857,Ok so i dont have advice but i would really appreciate if you could tell me which medication you took because i have super bad cramps and 10 minutes to work is something i need in my life 
858,"Are you getting child support from your ex? If not, start there. Extra money will help relieve the burden to some extent. You're NOT a bad person. You're in a terrible situation, and raising kids is SO FUCKING HARD even when you have all the resources in the world. You love them and you're doing your best, that's the important thing. I am 100% serious about this.

edit: a LOT of people love their kids but hate parenting. 

edit again: also, I agree with others who've said that things generally get much MUCH easier as kids get older. "
859,"No, she doesn’t like you, she just likes the attention,"
860,"&gt;The relationship with my current and my mum is good but I'm more worried about how she might react if she was to find out. 

If this relationship lasts she's going to find out one way or another, so best get ahead of it now. Seems like you're not in contact with your ex, she's no threat to your current relationship, and presumably your ex won't be invited to family occasions or similar. She's basically a young friend of your mum who your current GF will likely never meet or interact with. So long as your mum gets on well with your GF, all being well this is a non issue."
861,Oh my God. Please get a lawyer and make sure you get primary custody. This guy has no business raising children. 
862,"He never wanted anything more than that. They broke up soon after Ava was born and just didnt bother trying to get joint custody or anything more until Ella came into the picture. I wouldn't doubt that hes telling her these things. He's told her before that he never did anything wrong to Jordan, and that shes just a bad person but doesnt back it up with much other than typical issues new parents have. She doesn't seem to care if i play devils advocate, she just keeps complaining."
863,"its terrible that he did it and poor OP is traumatized. Anyone would be. There is a slight silver lining though. He crossed that line so far during the first physical incident that there is no buildup or dragging things out until OP realizes she has to leave. She knows that right now, which is very brave of her. She isn't trying to sugarcoat or excuse it. "

867,"&gt; saying I love you and ghosted me so she could focus on her sister.

So there's a lot to unpack here but I can assure you that she didn't break up with you to focus on her sister. That was just a reason she gave you. She broke up with you because your anxiety and neediness is extremely present. I'm not trying to shit on you but honestly the level you take it to is going to push like 99% of people away. You need to work on yourself. Therapy can help. "
868,"What? No he means maybe he accidently wrote the wrong number, or you texted the wrong number. You are right it doesn't add up, something else is going on. "
869,"This is abuse.  Your boyfriend is abusive and yes, this is a way of isolating you.  You need to move out and break up."
870,Not the same as acknowledging that he knows he's a predator. 
871,"This is an emergency health situation. You can probably get a doctor’s note for your employer. Your employer does not own you. Please, for your own sake, you NEED to see your psychiatrist to get this under control."
872,"This is addict behavior.  He's rationalizing one last binge before he gets clean, but surprise, he's not going to get clean with this attitude.

He needs a real come-to-Jesus moment, and I really don't know what you can do to help with him that.  ""Hitting rock bottom"" is tough to realize with food.


&gt; we could take our daughter to another country

This is a little beside the point, but a 1 year old is not going to get ANYTHING out of a trip to a foreign country that they couldn't get much more easily at home, and they won't remember any of it anyway."
873,"I wouldn't call those examples any sign of her moral compass being off, more of her just being a cheap, selfish, asshole.  None of those situations necessarily have a black and white, right or wrong answer.  Is it an asshole move to charge hundreds of dollars over market value to a family member looking to rent from you?  Yes, but it's not necessarily morally wrong.  Is it an asshole move to demand money to help someone move when they offer beer and pizza?  Yes, but it's not morally wrong.  Sounds like your girlfriend is just an asshole."
874,"Is it weird and out of the norm? Probably, even for twins.

Is in worrying or inappropriate? I don’t think so. It’s certainly not the type of relationship *I* have with my siblings, but it’s not raising any red flags, and it sounds like his GF is even fine with it.

Unless you start noticing more...intense...behaviors, I think you need to just move past it."
875,"Respectfully, it sounds like you have a personal and emotional attachment to gifts from an ex.  This isn’t wrong, but it does explain why you feel poorly about her keeping a gift from an ex.  Neither way is wrong, but it would be unfair for you to act as though she is keeping a sweater from an ex in “hopes of getting back together” when she isn’t."
876,"Cheaters often project their own behavior onto others. Are there any signs he's being unfaithful?

If not, it sounds like he's a paranoid asshole. Don't put up with his shit, OP."
877,"Your father is verbally abusive and your boyfriend condones it.  Dump your boyfriend.  When you've grown up with abuse sometimes your meter is off with what is normal or acceptable behavior from a partner.  I'd get therapy to unpack the abuse you've recieved so you can better recognize red flags in a partner.

My grandfather was like this to my mother and as she has told me many times ""My mother put up with his abuse and I had to grow up with it.  I was never going to put up with that kind of bullshit from a partner and I never want you to either."""
878,"You're wrong, this is absolutely the best solution."
879,"It sounds like this is not easy to talk to your husband about, but you do need to talk to him about it.  Maybe a marriage counselor could help you work through that conversation.  

You aren’t sure how much these remarks bother him, and it sounds like he doesn’t know how much they bother you.  You need to talk about that, and you also need to come up with a plan for what to do and what to say when his family start saying mean things. When his family are being awful, you should probably just get up and leave, and then refuse to see them again until they apologize.  But if your husband isn’t willing to stand up to his family, it will be hard.  

Do not move closer to his family until you have made significant progress dealing with his family. It will get worse once you’re closer, not better."
880,Do you have a mental health professional that you see regularly? Please mention this to them.

He'll probably just say, ""I was just being friendly, but I apologize if that's not how it came across,"" and then hold a major grudge against you as long as you work at your current employer. I wouldn't go down either of those roads right now. 

Practically speaking, for right now I think the best thing to do is to continue what you're already doing, which is to resist all attempts to push your boundaries and not give him what he wants out of these interactions. If he texts you about inappropriate subjects, just ignore the texts. If he tries to talk to you about non work subjects, be polite but don't engage more than necessary. Most importantly, document everything by saving texts or even keeping notes of each time he does something that makes you feel uncomfortable so you have a nice paper trail in case the situation gets ugly. 

Edit: In my experience, the way creeps operate is to subtly push on people's boundaries in a way that offers plausible deniability until they find someone who doesn't push back, and then once they have found the soft target that lets themself be pushed around, the harasser pushes more and more. If you don't let yourself be that easy mark, it sends the message that he should leave you alone or risk bad consequences. "
887,"I feel like she’s afraid of what will happen if you break up. She knows you’ve all been life long friends, so much so that you’ve become almost family, so there’s a lot to lose. "
888,"Yup. ITT: people who didn't read the dang post. Evidenced by comments like ""don't date coworkers,"" when the whole point is that they have different jobs lol"
889,"Alright so all I want to say is this. What makes you think she won’t do the exact same thing and treat you even worse this time? 

Do you think maybe she is lonely, so she turns to you because you give her the time of day and says things you want to hear but then eventually will be horrible to you again? 

Just don’t want to see you fall for a trap like I did, several times over and over. I learnt my lesson the hard way. 

Good luck OP, I hope whatever outcome, you are happy :) "
890,"Well, when he doesn’t put the effort in: No, he’s not enough. Why should you be sorry that he has to face reality?"
891,"I honestly think your brother would be heartbroken if you weren’t there, and I think it’s awful that she *thought* that, much less said it out loud. You won’t be in every photo, but it would be a shame for you to be in none of them. I hope your brother is able to gently guide her into a more understanding perspective. "
892,"Be sure to check and see the number of devices you’re logged in on. I once discovered someone had logged in to my Facebook from not my city and was checking up on me. 

Also, please post this to /r/legaladvice. You’ll have to note what state you’re located in, but you can get tips there on how to go about seeking a restraining order. This all is something a prosecutor would take seriously, so while I don’t want to freak you out unnecessarily, please do not brush this under the rug as if you’re not being rational. You are. 

Lastly, before you contact the police or anyone else about your suspicions, screenshot all of the Facebook messenger conversations. If he gets wind that something is up and blocks you, those messages will disappear. "
893,"I had a few friends who loved photography in college and did all kinds of shoots, even racy ones for couples. They were all really professional about it and are mostly all very top notch expensive photographers now.

What’s crazy is that as I read the post I didn’t even consider the fact that his friend would now have her nudes. 

I definitely see why he’s hurt but I agree, the intentions of everyone involved should be considered "
894,"Hey OP - try r/raisedbynarcissists . They've dealt with countless shitty parents and can give you advice on how to get out once you turn 18, plus moral support in the meantime. Good luck! "
895,"I’m trying and failing to imagine a scenario in which I’d see a naked faceless picture online, think to myself “hey, that’s probably what Dave’s girlfriend looks like naked”, and then bring it to his attention.

"
896,"Yeah, sounds a little funky to me too. I think you're right, it sounds like he's projecting."
897,"I haven't spoken to my siblings in &gt;20 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has not spoken to her sibling in &gt;10 years.  

&amp;#x200B;

No law says you must."
898,I was gonna be like yaaas girl get that coin
899,"This guy is a piece of shit. I don't understand what redeeming qualities you saw in this guy. Get him out of your house. Look into if you have to legally evict him and make sure you are safe when he moves out. 


Where was he living before?


These poor kids. And you aren't helping the matter by jumping so head first into a relationship with them. At this point, if you want to keep a relationship with them, talk to the grandparents about Skyping or something, after you break up."
900,Or the start of dementia. Aren't there people OP can send over to do a wellness check?
901,This is partially a complete lack of training and partially just the nature of having a dog. 
902,"I can totally see where this type of schedule could make you nuts...

Are you also working, or is this job 100% of your collective livelihood? 
"
903,"I'm not a photographer, but I'm an artist. I have to say, I'm really not seeing an issue here. You mention that this friend has ""an interest in photography"", but also has his own in house studio and equipment. To me this sounds like she approached him knowing he had the means and skill to do a good job, and didn't think farther than that. 

I know this sounds strange, but even when you're working with nude figures and purposefully putting them in ""sexy"" context, the process itself isn't necessarily sexy. My friends and I posed for each other a lot in college (though it wasn't explicit), knowing full well that some of us were gay/pan. I also have quite a few friends who work drawing porn commissions, and have tried my hand as well- it's really not just sitting there working while turned on and lusting after the content. (Full disclosure that I am ace, but am basing this on a pool of artists other than myself that are...very not asexual)

I think there's a good chance this isn't as strange as you think it is, but I recognize I don't know this guy and I wasn't a fly in the wall during the shoot. I just wanted to offer another perspective to help you feel better. 

Even if it was all a totally artistic process, you feeling uncomfortable is still the reality. Maybe talking about the shoot with her and learning the process to make this elaborate gift would help? So long as you don't frame it in an accusing manner, talking can't hurt. Edit: Also, you could express that the photos are amazing and you love them, but later on have a conversation about boundaries. Maybe she didn't realize that this was outside of your comfort zone."
904,"Normally, in a situation like this, I would advocate taking an approach along the lines of saying ""When you [do this], it makes me feel [this way].  I need to feel [this other way], and it would help me to do that if you would [behave in this other way]"".  That would give him the information he requires to know what you need, and therefore to decide whether your needs are important enough to him to change his behavior in order to help meet them.

However, the fact that he already invalidates your feelings tells me that if you try this, he'll just repeat the pattern.

So let me ask you this:  *why* do you love him?

Say this out loud to yourself (it's a sentence composed of your own words from your post):

&gt;I love my boyfriend so much.  He is arrogant af, feels he is superior to other people, can never compromise and sees other people's opinions as ""wrong"" and his opinion as ""fact"".  I  cant imagine starting a family with him, but I want to save our relationship because I love him.

How ridiculous did that sound, said aloud?  What would you say to a girlfriend who came to you and said that exact thing?"
905,"&gt; She just transferred her savings (from a joint account with our mom) into her own account. 

I just wanted to say good thinking on this part!  We see tons of posts where someone is planning to move out and then all of the sudden find their money/resources gone when the time comes.  Good thinking ahead.

*Edit: there &gt; their"
906,"If you were planning on ghosting her, there’s no time like the present. I will say a lil prayer for anonmoh jr bc I believe good intentions help good people. 

Even if you didn’t have prior disappointments, you don’t share other people’s announcements until the second trimester and they themselves have announced it and got their praise and well wishes. What your friend did was fucked up. 

More general advice? If someone threatens to demote you in the wedding party or remove you? Just say I appreciate you thinking of me in the first place but I won’t be sending a gift "
907,"OP: Please read this: Assuming you are in the US, a person can be admitted against their will for up to 72 hours, called an involuntary psych hold.

908,"Most competitive eaters I've seen are actually pretty fit people. I'd imagine you'd have to be, so yo don't get winded so quick as you pound down food. A guy who gets winded by moving from the couch is going to have problems, to say the least."

910,It’s like a porcupine got tangled up in a Handmaid’s laundry. 
911,"It sounds like Steven's dynamic with his new wife is complicated in ways that have nothing to do with you (I mean, the ""weirdness"" with him having female friends suggests either that she's projecting her insecurities onto his platonic relationships, or he has done something to earn her mistrust). Is this friendship important enough to you that you want to deal with that? 

It doesn't sound like there's any malice in Steve's actions, but you're certainly not obligated to make the lion's share of effort in upholding the friendship or to jump through hoops in order to stay friends. "
912,All of it is intentional. 
913,Ask your mom how she would feel if your boyfriend's dad makes the same remarks to/about you. 
914,Your boyfriend is a jealous psycho imo
915,"I wish your husband would call them out on their behavior in the moment. I don't know if they actually dislike you, or if they just lack manners, but feedback on it would be much better received coming from their friend."
916,[removed]
917,Nope. She waited too long. Anything she says now will come across as either petty or adding insult to a fatal injury.
918,"Are you just going to ignore all the advice, or?"
919,Op what you don't realize is that they both were trying to rekindle their relationship. She's angry with and refuses to see him after he tells her he has a girlfriend. And what reason is he upset with you for? I think three months was long enough with this boy. You deserve better.
920,"Reasons like this are why it is super tough to get married so young. 

In my view, you spend more time at work (unfortunately) than you do with your significant other. A feeling of self worth or self accomplishment from your career is also extremely important for your self esteem and mental well being. If these jobs are truly not available in your area, and your husband does not see how your career advancement is important to you, then I think some serious conversations about where this marriage is going, where each of you wants to be in 5-10 yrs etc is important to have now."
921,"It did read as a bit manipulative. Ie ""don't dump me, or my anxiety will get worse"""
922,"She might have just wanted to kiss without having sex.

The snooze alarm thing is the only thing in your whole story where she is being inconsiderate. And yes, it's really inconsiderate. "
923,"If your wife is willing to throw away your marriage over a few hundred dollars per year, the issue could very well be about feeling like she isn't part of the financial decision to give money to someone else.  Your sister is self-sufficient and you're not supporting her. You're investing in seeing your family and enjoying their company.

Go to couple's counseling."
924,I'm thinking it's not fair to her to keep this relationship going if she's more invested than you are. 
925,"It's quite clear from your post that you are prioritising things over her. If my partner got home at 8pm and continued working until 10pm while I was pregnant, ignoring me while doing so, and didn't work with me or change his behaviour when I expressed my needs, I would leave too. When you're home, when are you actually spending time with her? 

You're going to have a baby and she can't trust that when you're home, you're paying attention and being with her. That's clearly an untenable situation for her. 

You should be apologising profusely, talking though what she needs, and how you achieve that. Talk though what it looks like when the baby arrives, what support looks like for her, and how you can help achieve that.

That might mean putting your phone down when you arrive home, and not picking it up until morning. It might mean talking to your employer about your work hours, or setting aside more phone free time.

If you're having issues with phone or work addiction, or you're still struggling with feeling resentful, please get some professional help. Your wife needs you now, and will need you actually present when the baby arrives. Don't mess this up. "
926,"The only reason he wants her back is he thinks he can continue to control her. 

Wait for phase two, when he realizes that is over. OP, if you think he has been awful to you now, you may discover just what he can be. Be prepared to hear how you will never find anyone else to take your old disgusting self into a relationship. How fat and ugly you are. How you’re the one with a psychological problem. "
927,"If this is an isolated incident, it sounds like she is over reacting. This is my personal opinion as a parent.

If her first thought is rehab, she doesnt understand there's a middle ground between sainthood and full blown addiction. Maybe explain respectfully that experimentation is incredibly common and has little bearing on his future or his potential. There's good reason rehab facility advertising doesn't mention helping you with ""that one time you experimented with the pot"" - because it doesnt need rehabilitation.

Millions of people maintain healthy relationships with alcohol and marijuana. She needs to comprehend that while discipline is fine, her reaction needs to be commesurate with what he's done. 

As for private school... it doesnt sound needed on the merits of your post alone. Does she have other concerns about his education or values? If shes had other issues with the school/district apart from this incident, she may be set on the idea. Many people prefer private schools for many reasons, both religious and non-religious.

She also needs to understand that he's going to be an adult soon. Your post doesnt state how close he is to turning 18. She needs to consider how he will react to all this, and understand that these actions may only push him away. He could be counting the days to 18 as we speak.

If you ever caught her partying as a teenager, maybe remind her of that."
928,"Idk man, a lot of this seems to be because you feel insecure in comparison to this guy. You say you are aging, you don’t see how she could be attracted to you anymore, but you describe him as Mr. Perfect. Also, I feel a lot better and sexier and happier after having spent time with people I enjoy spending time with. Even if she is digging the husband and then screwing your brains out later I don’t see what the problem is, as long as that continues to be the case. I’d let it be "
929,I bring my computer to the office but I actually have two laptops (my personal machine and a work provided machine). I suppose I could leave one at home semi permanently to use it like this... What is the name of the software that you recommend?
930,"I had a fiance for 4 years that didn't believe it wasn't consensual when I was raped by an acquaintance of his. He just acted like ""you cheated early on before we had the relationship talk"". He acted like it was no big deal, but I know he held it as a resentment (wrongly) instead of believing me and being there for me. 

  He used it as a ""see I don't even care that you stepped out on me"" and used it as a way to keep me compliant/ as a manipulation tactic where he was the good guy and I was the bad guy who was ""forgiven"".

  It took me years to unpack all of this and heal myself. I bet when you leave, all the bullshit you've had to put up with for 3 years will start to organize itself and become clearer. 

  Find someone who respects you. It's worth the wait."
931,Why is your boyfriend more concerned about excusing an abuser’s behavior than his own girlfriend’s safety? He did a pretty good job of invalidating and dismissing you and your feelings. If he doesn’t kick this friend to the curb I’d have serious doubts about staying with someone so willing to overlook this instance of sexual assault- I’m sure it wasn’t his scummy friend’s first offense. 
932,"&gt;I guess I'm really looking for opinions on whether people think his position is reasonable, and if not, why?

It's not reasonable, and you KNOW it's not reasonable. Stop enabling this."
933,"The second you felt uncomfortable or wanted to leave, you should have. Don't let other people stop you from doing what is best for you. You need to take care of yourself first and foremost.

You don't owe her a damn thing."
