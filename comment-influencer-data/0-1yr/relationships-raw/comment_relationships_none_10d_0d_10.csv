2,"Nice work, OP. I don't know you, but I'm proud of you."
3,"You fucked up. Have you told your dad that you've actually been undermining *his* training by deliberately training the dog to enter rooms your dad is trying to keep him out of?

By the way...LOTS of people don't give their dogs people food or allow them to beg. I'm one of them."
4,"I gotta be real with you here: either you need to look a little deeper when you pick a partner, or you are destined to be treated like shit by a super-hottie for the next 20 years. And the appeal of superficial characteristics like looks and money and him being articulate but cocky or whatever assholery he has going on will lose their appeal REALLY fast. People with genuine intelligence don't have to resort to being an asshole and they sure as schnitzel don't resort to racist ad hominems."
5,Compromise get a cat. They never climb on anything.
6,"He was a total jerk here. His sister is ridiculous, racist, and *effed* and it appears that since he condones this behavior, so is he."
7,"Eh, she's allowed to hate fur and not want it at her party even if every action she takes isn't in line with the animal rights agenda. That is her right, and it's no more hypocritical than folks claiming to be generally against animal torture while buying factory farmed meat.

But even if she was fully A.L.F. compliant, she wouldn't be allowed to launch into hateful xenophobic rants at friends of the family/guests in her home without suffering serious social consequences. The fact that boyfriend and his family don't see this as a problem worth addressing means that they simply aren't worth spending time with and becoming a part of their lives."
8,"Because I think it’s too much. Its like his hobby takes precedence over his career. As if he is escaping responsibility. 

I call it pointless and then we argue and then in between are the racist harsh comments."
9,"OK.  I don't believe you and I doubt she will be very pleased with your snooping either, but go ahead and try telling her and let us know how it goes!"
10,"Your idea of a ""the man of your dreams"" is an asshole? Why is that part of your fantasy?"
11,"its hard to explain, like hes super sweet, he takes me out to eat almost everyday and part of me really really wants this to work so like i said im giving him the benefit of the doubt"
12,"Ive been seeing my current girlfriend for 14 years, living together for 12, and haven't proposed and have no plans of doing so. Every relationship is different. 

That said either you trust him or you dont. If you do then you have nothing to worry about elieve what hes telling you and carry on. If you dont well thats another issue."
13,I’m so sorry this happened to you. You are not a pathetic fool
14,"I am getting help. In person, especially with somebody I really like, I'm really in the moment with them. On dating apps where people can't judge anything about what I'm like in this respect I have yet to match with somebody in my area. I don't understand what it is"
15,"I think it's too soon to know. You have had one occasion when he got super quiet and distant and wouldn't say why. In your position, I'd say, ""I felt bad when we were walking and you quickly got quiet and wouldn't say why."" He may protest or explain or tell you it was nothing. Just repeat, ""I felt bad when it happened. If you feel that way again, will you please tell me how your doing? "" If he still doesn't say sorry or say he'll do things differently in the future, ask another way. Like, ""When you don't feel like talking, would you be willing to tell me why?""

That way, you're saying how you felt and asking for what you need. You're not criticizing him; you're just letting him know how to be quiet without letting you feel ignored."
16,"Its not. Your missing the point.

It's the fact that she has done it for others who meaned less to her than I do but won't do it for me. Jealously is a shitty thing."
17,It sounds like OP is making more and more money and will eventually reach a point where his partner wouldn't even need to work anymore and would be perfectly capable of being a stay-at-home mom. That's plenty of stability and reliability.
18,"For anyone who’s interested, I told her goodbye tonight. It was horrible, and the thought that I may never speak to her or see again is heartbreaking. But it is the right decision. She kept telling me ‘if I was single I would be with you’ ‘if I had nothing to lose I wold be with you’. But she did have something to lose, she lost me. Guess it’s time to focus on myself now."
19,"You are welcome, I am not sure if I'm past this, but after years of getting hurt I did get fed up. Funny enough it was one sentence he said that did the trick. After finding yet another strange woman to marry without thinking, whom I just did not want to meet, he said ""I don't have the time to lead multiple lives, accept my life or you won't be in it."" So I followed his new motto, he can accept my life or not be in it. It has been working for a few months.

Surprisingly enough he did come to my wedding, without the new ""wife"", and behaved well. I have nice father-daughter memories from my wedding, a thing I've never hoped for. 

I hope you find your balance with your father, honestly I think that setting up your boundaries is what helps most, but it is bloody hard and takes nerves to wait out his reaction."
20,"Low six figures is more savings than most people (with kids) ever have.

You’re making excuses about why you guys aren’t ready for kids, and it’s pretty clear here that’s because you just don’t want them and are hoping you’ll be more enthusiastic later on.... will you?"
21,"Right. Part of having a market is following demand, and China has a big demand and a growing amount of wealth. Makeup retailers are not going to ignore that in favor of a few vegans/animal rights activists. I have my own opinion on this as well, but you can't blame these retailers for following demands. They have to make their money somehow."
22,"Even if you forget the part about being super rude about wearing fur, she made loud racist comments about you to your face. If your SO can't see how inappropriate that is, I think you two have big problems."
23,Thank you this comment is helpful and not just bashing him :)
24,oh well..take some time to reflect on what happened and take care of yourself :)
25,"She doesn’t want you to find a new partner and move on. It happened to me, I became more ambitious in my relationship and then left my partner . You can’t stop yourself from growing and it’s unintentional but if you don’t get on with what you want then you will regret it later and build a resentment ."
26,"He obviously thinks he is superior to me, or maybe even compared to most people. No doubt about it. To be fair, I’m not the most optimistic person when it comes to my country and my people (no one would be)...but I’ve never gone as far as to calling my people “damaged” or my country a “shithole”."

28,"I read A LOT of r/weddingplanning before getting married. B-lists were a thing and people had differing opinions. Due to budget or space limits, there were people they couldn't initially invite. Some people thought it was rude, others said they felt honored to be invited later, because the person wanted them to come. 


As for their parents reaching out, it's probably not a close family member (or it's a young family member whose parents are handing the entire wedding. I sent out fomal invitations, but my mom invited anyone we were even tangentially related to, and I had her deal with any extra information for those people.


But you're busy that day, and you didn't get advance notice. Just say ""thank you for the invitation, I'm sorry I can't make it"". Even if you got a formal invitation months earlier, it's an invitation, not a summons. 


Your choice if you want to send a small gift."
29,"Before you become too serious makes the most sense and it gives those who are uncomfortable a chance to pull out. Things I would consider however as you proceed with any relationship and before you make any decisions (from personal experience): 
-in the honeymoon phase people might gloss over those details thinking they can live with it or that you will change that for them once you are in a committed relationship
-your friendship with your ex's might change in time as it is. They might get partners who are not comfortable with you and they might make the call to cut contact (happened to me) and you will need to respect that. Which then begs the question if it is worth choosing them over someone who might be the right person for you. 
None of the above might happen obviously and you might meet your person who loves living in the 'gray' rather than 'black and white'. Have fun and good luck :)"
30,"I think for a lot of people, ""Why do you love me?"" is a terrible question. There's often no reason beyond ""this is my person."" 

In general it doesn't sound like he's a bad person, but you have differing love languages and attachment needs, and your bed for closeness causes him to push away to preserve his need for space. I think you may just be better off with someone else instead of continuing to try to make this work while you're both miserable. Reading up on adult attachment styles may help, whether you break up or not."
31,"IMO your looking at his phone was worse than what you found on it. So i can totally see why he is over it he probably feels he was violated and that you were in the wrong not him, and i would agree with that. If you dont trust him at least break up with him and dont string him along."
32,your boyfriend does know that fur is controversial to many Americans and could have said something to you about it before the party.
33,Is he a Marine by any chance?
34,Seriously that’s all your worried about? Have you read anything I typed? Meet someone outside your job.
35,"Don't blame yourself for not saying yes. If he would want to be with you and acts like a grown up, he will contact you. If not, there would likely still be problems even if you would just have taken a break / not boken up."
36,"Infantry could be Army or Marines, it just means that he’s a foot soldier in whatever branch he’s in. 

It doesn’t really matter, but I’m admittedly curious."
37,[removed]
38,"&gt;the question of who pays for dates needs to be addressed early in the relationship. 

I agree with this as well, but it wasn't on the list for me to address."
39,"I have a thought here. Have you ever taken sleeping pills? Multiply how vulnerable you are sleeping by 1000. You don't even remember what happened the next day. This guy was next-level vulnerable, waaaaayy beyond being able to consent. And if anyone should be aware of these limitations, it's his wife. It's not exciting or funny to think you might have been taken advantage of."
40,"He may be miserable, but at that point of life it is difficult to change.  Besides he probably thinks he is right about everything as well.  Your saying is to the point."
41,"I'm not saying that's true for everyone, or will be true for all of my relationships, but I hate wasting a good friendship on a bad breakup"
42,"“Thinking about going to therapy” is unsubtle code for “I’m not in therapy.” 

Dude doesn’t even have the motivation to stay awake when his girlfriend is coming over. What makes you think he’s motivated enough to find and work with a therapist?"
43,"Oh, I didnt know that. Army infantry :)"
44,"You were pretty hot and cold. Mixed signals. Also not really progressing with getting your head around your relationship.  There does not sound like there is anything for him to do, other than wait on you. He should break up, you are not giving him any other choice.

You should make up your mind. Do you want this to work or not?  If not then it is easy to schedule getting your stuff.  He is holding on to it to see if there is any hope. The minute you get it, he will figure that you are truly finally broken up.

If you want things to work out, can you say how you want him to act?  What can he do?  Throw the guy a bone.  

While you are working out your issues, you can just date to have fun and decide not to discuss any issues.  You had sex that way."
45,"&gt;I just want to be a normal adult for a little bit before doing the family thing.

I totally understand that sentiment.

But in your first post you didn't say ""for a year."" You said ""three years."" Three years is a looong time."
46,"Looking at your post history, you need serious professional psychiatric help. Your life is revolving around this person that hasn’t been in your life for two years. If you come off in person anywhere near as miserable as you sound in your posts that’s why you can’t meet anyone. You need to stop dating and take care of yourself."
47,"If my sibling launched into a xenophobic rant against my SO, I'd leave the party and not engage with them until I got a full apology.

Your boyfriend sounds like trash."
48,"Just another white american checking in to confirm your boyfriend is a racist asshole. Don't tolerate him for any reason, you deserve better."
49,[removed]
50,"He was abusive and it sounds like he raped you.  It was never going to go well, to see him again.  Abusers don't care about you, so they will never admit fault or apologize sincerely.  He doesn't care.

I think you need to count that money lost, or just refuse to interact with him unless it's about the money.

I'm sorry for what you went through.  You need to move on through therapy/counseling and time.  Interacting with him is NEVER going to be a positive experience."
51,Why are you questioning his hobby?
52,"This is one of those situations where you really need to see a relationship counselor. You need someone to mediate this conversation with him. You both are looking forward to the same future, but just on slightly different timelines. Hopefully you can work this out, but if he won't budge, I think you need to focus on what you need to do to make sure you don't live your life with any regrets."
53,This is absolutely inspiring for anyone to read!
54,"...I was hoping for a picture of the dog. I’m glad things have started to get better, though. I think this might be a good example of dogs making lives better."
55,"Do you have any proof that she actually sent these pics? If not, she took those just for her. And you come off as pretty pushy."
56,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I know he loves me 

Really?  He's telling you how he feels by his behavior.  This is not the behavior of a 20 year old who is seven months into a relationship where he is in love. 

Either dump him right now, or tell him in extremely clear terms how you feel about his behavior (sounds like you've been a little tentative to be honest, which is itself also a concern) and see if he changes."
57,that's what my question was...
58,"It has been a rough year for my bf and me so far. We made it through me having to find a new job, passing my final exams, going through some depressive episodes around my body image and now finally lap surgery with a diagnosis of advanced endo.... Brexit is looming above our head too.

Still my bf is by my side as best as he can (long distance is not easy) and even with the possibility of not being able to conceive kids with me, he's talking about his move and our engagement next year. I really don't know how I deserve this guy.

Also, a great thanks to my work colleagues and friends. I got so many messages, flowers, calls etc. I feel so loved and cared for, which is overwhelming. &lt;3"

61,You're a shit-friend and she'd be better off if you leave her alone.
62,"Hopefully, OP will take the advice of /u/Voleuse, who said everything I wanted to say and more.  Great advice."
63,"Haha at least someone :D

He absolutely has a sense of humour and that's why I don't understand that nothing is coming back.

I have not paid that much attention when he talks to others, but he does ocasionally do it with others, too. As far as I remember though."

66,"Good parents have to enforce boundaries sometimes, and kids generally don’t appreciate it. There is probably some truth to her claim that your room was unacceptably messy and removing you from your room, though not the most generous approach, is not an inappropriate enforcement in that case. 

That having been said, her having your little sister to move into your room while you are out is kind of weird."
67,"In an ideal world, he would be quickly dragged to jail for both raping you and also being an insensitive jerk with regards to your feelings.

Sadly, we are not there yet.

If you are able to recoup that 4K via the justice system, both legally speaking and emotionally speaking since the process might not be easy, I highly suggest you do.

Some of that money might never come back to you otherwise since he will probably stop paying at some point. That could be worth ""paying"" as the price to never see that awful person again, but that is up to you.

Good luck, in the most heartfelt way possible."
68,"100% this is what happened

it's common for young people to get crushes when spending time with older people, because they admire them and (foolishly) think them spending time together is a reflection on their worth. which is precisely why teenagers- who don't have the capacity to reason or think longterm like adults, should be kept away from adults."

71,"These comments all seem extremely American. It’s true your request is very reasonable, but if you keep arguing with your mil the way you have been you or makes moves to kick her out you risk alienating your wife, and I doubt your daughters growing up without a happy healthy mother-father dynamic is how you want to raise them either. This isn’t an issue to hash out in screaming matches with your mil. Based on my personal family dynamics (also the child of an immigrant here) you need to sit down with your wife and calmly lay out all your concerns. In much more detail and more insistent since you’ve already had a serious talk about it. This is something she needs to enforce with her mother, not you. If she’s not willing or won’t try to figure out some other kind of compromise she’s choosing her mother’s comfort over yours and that’s a separate and potentially much more damaging issue. But putting her immigrant mother who doesn’t speak much English on a bus is the nuclear option and I doubt it will have any kind of positive effect on your marriage dynamic."
72,"Tbh, if I were you I’d think he was probably gay. What is a buttjob? Is that him having anal sex with you or something anal he derives pleasure from? There are red flags here (or rainbow in this instance). Hope you’re ok"
73,"“In her culture” what fucking part of Mexico is she from, the part on Mars?

My in-laws are all Mexican, my mother in law is Mexican

She would crawl over broken glass to pick her grand babies up at school - and every grandmotherly woman I’ve met in Mexico is the same way ( in my personal experience )

I think your MIL is just a narcissist - “ well I had a HARD time and I DESERVE this” 

Your wife is an enabler , which I get since my wife is exact same way - she wouldn’t side with me versus her parents for first 5 years of our marriage , I think that is pretty common.

Have a real discussion with your wife, break it down in dollars - we rent this condo for 200 a night at least 4 times a month we are giving her $800 a month for free and only asking her to watch our kids a total of 16 hours a week , you’re paying her  $12.50 an hour equivalent for this task."
74,I asked her yesterday if she could drive and she said she couldn’t because she needs to get a new tag for her car cause she just started a new job and had to wait to get paid for a tag. So I was gonna be the one driving! Second I texted her and told her I can make it up to her and she didn’t even respond
75,"He said half a day four days a week. Rereading he ALSO said four hours...  So yeah, definitely mixed messages here."
76,"Someone can be happy with being totally nude at home but when they entertain guests they should expect that not all of them would be comfortable with that. She's the one inviting you over, it's not like you're barging into her house demanding she puts more clothes on. All you need to do is be open and tell her it makes you uncomfortable because you're not together anymore and it makes you think of the time you were, and you don't want that."
77,"You are assuming she will call, but maybe she won't, so you gotta brace yourself for that possibility too!

Otherwise just keep her on the backburner, and ask if she'll call or ghost again.

For a wedding invite you need a bit more stable relationship. Go with the flow, but set reasonable boundries."
78,"Just get her out. She's just going to destroy this marriage. It's happening already. What's going to happen when she has legal tendency, as well as a green light from your wife to act like an entitled asshole. You'll be done."

80,"What a bunch of prigs ITT.  She’s not a predator and you’re not prey.

If you think friend’s mom is attractive, and you’re both consenting adults....where’s the harm?

Just remember, it’s just a fling."
81,Yes seems like you are just feeling jealous in this situation . She sounds like a nice person doing a simple act to help your roommate feel better
82,"My ex used to do this, in my opinion it is mental abuse. I dont think he will stop even if you talk to him, atleast not in my experience.

84,Why should she believe you? Did you make it up to her all the other times you cancelled?
85,"Yeah OP, what about your life plans? Does that include supporting a struggling musician?"
86,"I don't think you can tell your partner not to talk to half the friggin' human race using a common communication medium because he might cheat on you.  That's a very restrictive boundary to draw, and if you're not able to find trust without that, your relationship is dead in the water."
87,"&gt;Why would we take a cab to hike?

...so that you didn't have to cancel the day's plan after being unable to find your keys and her specifically asking you not to cancel? Are you seriously not understanding this?"
88,"As horrible as this is, I'm glad it happened before you proposed. I'm so so sorry for you. Some people are just susceptible to propaganda bullshit. Way more people than you realize, tbh. I know you think she's not going insane, but she's definitely going through some kind of mental instability. If you want to address that you can try, but she is likely to be stubborn and recalcitrant about it. If it were me, I would cut my losses and end the relationship. 

This same kind of thing happened to my sister some years ago. She changed nearly overnight and I know there's a mental issue there that hasn't been addressed. She never went back to being the person she used to be. Her husband couldn't take it and divorced her. Once I finally understood the sister I knew and loved was gone, I grieved her death. I still see her occasionally but there is no feeling. I already grieved her death. She doesn't even exist to me anymore. But I truly love and still miss my *real* sister."
89,"Please read the books The Fuck it Diet and Body is Not an Apology.

90,Find a job and move out ASAP or see if you can live with your boyfriend and work there.
91,Why have you been putting up with this for so long? No 'loving boyfriend' goes *three years* without sex with his partner because he can't be bothered to deal with condoms. He is selfish and shows a complete lack of interest in making you happy or giving you satisfaction. This is not okay. You deserve so much better.
92,"This sub is littered with people who moved too quickly because when they first met the person, everything seemed so right and they were just perfect for each other and they both knew that they had found The One.

Guess what? It wasn't The One. And a couple years later they're in a huge mess that could've been avoided if they'd pumped the brakes.

If you really are soulmates, you'll still be soulmates in a couple years. The fact that she's pushing for a baby after three months, and acted like you're a monster for expressing some hesitation, gives me doubt that things are as perfect as they seem, because that's not perfect - that's irrational and disrespectful of your feelings. 

Please beware of her trying to get pregnant with your consent. And PLEASE, if you realize that there are actually significant problems here, do not sweep them under the rug because you want to believe everything is really as great as it seemed initially. It is really not hard to keep up a facade for three months. If it were, everybody would make a lifetime commitment after three good months."

I get your point about how shocking, hurtful and scary this is to her wife's mother. And to the wife, too. I truly get that.

My empathy for them ends here, they both knew what they were getting into into. Intentionally or not they have blindsided OP and are refusing to deal with it like adults and are hiding behind _cultural expectations_. No, that is not fair. It is not OP's fault he wasn't told that oh by the way, abuela will be living here without contributing neither money nor time. Abuela is 50 years old, she is not a grandma. Yes she got divorced and will have to rebuild her life, that doesn't grant her a free pass to ignore basic human decency.

To OP /u/AccomplishedProblem7 : This mythical multi generational home with the abuelas and nietos is a social construct, one that you sign up for willfully and not forcefully via getting yelled at in spanish by a very angry woman in her 50s who refuses to accept the fact that she has get a job and contribute her fair share to the house she is currently living in.

Don't let them say ""but my culture"" to excuse their intentional lack of communication with you. You married your wife to start a new life, to build a new house and fill it with new memories together like adults. Not to unilaterally make choices that will impact both your lives irreversibly for the next 20 years.

Next step is simple: Either _grandma_ realizes she is not a grandma and has to pay her fair share via money or time, or she is out of the house. If wife doesn't understand, it's serious counseling time.

This is a hill I would be very willing to die on."
94,"He forced him self on you often ( Rape/attempted rape ).

Finically abused you .

Took your credit card and ran up a bill ( fraud? Theft ).

And you haven’t been to the police?

Seriously?"

96,You should move on. This is your friend cutting off contact with people she's had past romantic interactions with in the service of her relationship. That's most likely the right call for her. Respect that and move on.
97,"He’s being a little childish like someone else said, but also, it doesn’t sound like he doesn’t want to go — he just can’t with his career. You don’t have to not go, because that would be unreasonable. I still feel like you could be a little more conscientious by not excitedly telling him who is going to replace him on the vacation he can’t afford to go on. At this point, though, since that’s already done, I would suggest having a conversation where you say you plan on going and you’re sorry that he can’t come, but that you realize you could have been more sensitive about his feelings."
98,"What a bunch of prigs ITT.  She’s not a predator and you’re not prey.

If you think friend’s mom is attractive, and you’re both consenting adults....where’s the harm?

Just remember, it’s just a fling."
99,"Your girlfriend's main issue is that she's not your friend. There's no amount of will power on your part that's going to make her your friend. Plus, you're already physically and emotionally cheating on your GF and really don't seem like you're going to stop doing that anytime soon. Your GF deserves something better than this. Go let her find it. It's best for you both."

102,But he doesn't want to be with you.  He asked for a break to pursue her...  what if she had said ok?  He would have left you.  He is just using you as backup girlfriend to fill the void while he isn't with her.  You don't ask for breaks in a healthy monogamous relationship to pursue other people.
103,"You’re too old for him. Sorry, but that’s the truth."
104,[removed]
105,You could always just be civil to her (and maybe even be friends) but just take dating off the table.
106,I strongly agree with you. I’ve told him time and time again that the thought of leaving has never crossed my mind and I’d always be by his side for as long as he’d let me.
107,I don't understand why you think this is a reasonable response to c&amp;p onto so many unrelated comments.
108,She’s 20 years old. She should be moving out or taking those steps and her father doesn’t get to prevent her from taking that on. Using the “well these types of parents” argument is ridiculous. She’s just supposed to live at home forever? Come on.
109,"COACHES are teaching children a skill, and those professions/volunteer positions are often gateways to child abuse.

you sound like an idiot."
110,"It's very disappointing and annoying if social plans constantly get cancelled, especially on super short notice. You sound flaky and unreliable. I would withdraw from the relationship too. You can't just change your mind or cancel due to your own disorganisation all the time and still expect people to wait around for you."
111,Break up with your girlfriend so she can find someone who respects and wants only her.
112,"These comments all seem extremely American. It’s true your request is very reasonable, but if you keep arguing with your mil the way you have been you or makes moves to kick her out you risk alienating your wife, and I doubt your daughters growing up without a happy healthy mother-father dynamic is how you want to raise them either. This isn’t an issue to hash out in screaming matches with your mil. Based on my personal family dynamics (also the child of an immigrant here) you need to sit down with your wife and calmly lay out all your concerns. In much more detail and more insistent since you’ve already had a serious talk about it. This is something she needs to enforce with her mother, not you. If she’s not willing or won’t try to figure out some other kind of compromise she’s choosing her mother’s comfort over yours and that’s a separate and potentially much more damaging issue. But putting her immigrant mother who doesn’t speak much English on a bus is the nuclear option and I doubt it will have any kind of positive effect on your marriage dynamic. 

I also agree with the other commenter that the whole post comes across as you making all the decisions and just expecting your wife to carry them out. If that’s the case use this conversation to see what exactly it is your wife feels about this situation. Maybe you’ve been steamrolling her this whole time and this is the straw for her."
113,Yes seems like you are just feeling jealous in this situation . She sounds like a nice person doing a simple act to help your roommate feel better
114,"Stop focusing on getting a relationship and focus solely on yourself. Work out, if you can't afford the gym, walk, jog, or even find videos on YouTube to work out at home. Find some self help books and start to build your confidence. Your not going to be able to find a working relationship with someone if your not happy woth yourself. Also, who cares if the other person is attractive. Start looking at their heart. Beauty is nothing compared to love."
115,"I struggle with this same concept! It is important to first ground yourself in the idea that you are this way for a reason. When you were growing up, was it vital that you were a people pleaser, and were you punished for being assertive? This is often the case with young women.

First, allow yourself to be assertive. It does depend on the scenario. This whole plan takeover situation, in the group chat, you would probably want to say, “Well, since it was my offer originally, and I wanted to do this specific activity, I’d like to do that. Otherwise, you two can split off and do what you were planning to do, and I can go find someone else to do this with me.” It’s hard, especially if you didn’t have anyone else lined up to do the activity with. Chances are, they’ll realize their proposal is unfair and do your original activity (if your friend is comfortable enough with you and cares about you enough to take criticism), or they will truly split off (if this person is just an acquaintance and doesn’t care enough about your feelings) and you’ll have to wait until someone else can do what you wanted, whether it’s on the same day or the next week. Either way, you’ve thinned out the amount of people who are going to invalidate or take advantage of you.

It’s really hard when it seems like you’d take any company over no company at all, but the more you cultivate those friendships where you can express your needs and cull those that invalidate your feelings, your circle will grow stronger and you’ll grow more confident. Reminder that you can also always meet new people who, in a few weeks’ or months’ time, might be more considerate of your feelings than those who cancel or change plans on you. Those inconsistent and flaky people are just as replaceable and disposable to you, as they make you feel to them!"

117,This is a hill to die on my friend. Keep us updated please !
118,"This is gross. You’re just being a coward and ruining a decent portion of your girlfriends life. You need to tell her what you did and give her a chance to make her own choice. If you hadn’t cheated maybe she would have even been able to do poly, but you’ve pretty much ruined that. And if she even forgives you she’d ask you to cut out that friend and I bet you’re not willing to do that. 

Let your girlfriend know so she can dump you and your friend can get the scraps of a man that obviously will cheat on her in 6 years with his new best friend"
119,Weird. Mention it maybe?

124,"OP I'm worried at his response to conflict and disagreements.  He felt like he wasted time with you and threw that in your face?  I know you updated but can I suggest maybe revisiting the ways you two communicate?  This is not going to be the only time you two butt heads or have conflicting values, stressed or not you both need the ability to know when to end an interaction and give each other space so you dont hurt each other's feelings with rashness.  I'm not saying you need to break up but it might be worth revisiting the way you two argue; John Gottman's studies on marriage show happy relationships dont lack arguments but have a healthier format to them.  You two reconnected over dinner but itd be good to revisit the conflict imo."

He broke it off with you. 

He forced you to move out because you weren't compatible living together.

He's seeing someone and lying about it.

I also found it odd that she refused to contribute with the grandchildren. Perhaps it’s because of the hostility between the son in law and herself.  The situation and tone might have led her to refuse. 

As you stated, sitting down and having a productive conversation might be helpful- calm voices and calm minds might lend themselves to a better resolution."

151,thank you
152,Who taught you that it's normal for your wife to explore sexual activities outside of your marriage? You feel invalidated because it's literally invalidating. You wife does not want to be with you the same way you want to be with her.

155,"There’s literally no reason for the mother in law to be living with you rent free. She needs to either find a job and pay rent, earn her keep by helping around the house and childcare, or she needs to leave and go provide for herself elsewhere. You didn’t agree to take her in indefinitely. And the whole “in my culture kids take care of their parents” thing really sounds like she has no intention of ever leaving. If I were you I would lay down the law NOW, before this goes on for any longer. She could’ve gotten a job 4 months ago and been paying rent this whole time. Even some part time maid would be able to make the $800 a month rent."

Saying sorry or it being an accident does not make the plate whole. You have made your apologies. They know where to find you if they want to. It’s best for you to move on with the cracks."
160,"Thanks for your comment :) I have told her that if we go through with the marriage, a pre-nup would be a must for me, and she agreed. I do not think she is maliciously seeking to exploit me through this process, but just is very emotional and sometimes aggressive.

Would a solid pre-nup insulate from these types of risks? Or are there certain obligations inherent in the partner visa that would supersede any prenup agreement?"

167,"You might try calling your local crisis hotline and figuring out the best way to go. A random ER may not even have a psychiatrist on call.  You might be better off taking her to a particular ER with the right people on call, or it might be best to take her to a public mental health clinic.

That scumbag wasted a year of your life by living a double life. The lies he must have told to be able to get away with it for a whole year. He TOOK A YEAR FROM YOU.

Just send her screenshots of his begging.










Also, you have to tell us... How did you find out? I want the juicy parts too! But really, knowing how others figure things out can often help complete strangers by using the same smarts that people like you have previously."
170,"Okay. In that case I guess it's kind of irrelevant what you do. I feel sorry for his wife but I think the majority of people would want to know. But if you do tell her, you should do it quickly and just rip the band aid off, and be prepared for him to spin it into a story about you being the bad person."
171,"Stop asking that question.  And stop using getting a dog as a way to get some life long commitment out of him. 
First of all... he could say yes to that question and then totally change his mind later in the relationship. So- yes is no guarantee of anything.

He is committed to you know and if you stay together, the relationship should grow towards marriage. Asking that question shows you are insecure and wanting some guarantee on his love. That alone could have him deciding that he doesn’t want to marry you. 

Working on yourself is great but doing it for someone else’s approval is not.   It sounds like you are constantly evaluating the relationship and trying to up your game to be everything he ever wanted.  Exhausting. Things sound like they are going well- enjoy the relationship and relax.  Adopt a dog together. It is a great way to see well you guys can work together caring for another entity."
172,"I do have proof but there is always the chance she still won’t believe me.

I’m still processing my own feelings. A lot of those feelings are related to burning his life to the ground so I’m trying to chill out before doing anything"
173,"My husband cheated on me, and I sure wish one of those women had the integrity to tell me. Please tell her, OP. She deserves to know what kind of man she's married to. Let her make her own decisions from there, but don't let her stay ignorant."
174,"Nobody can really answer how long you want should wait for someone in a LDR. If you look into the subreddits for LDRs like r/longdistance you will find people especially overseas that are 1-3 years and are nevermets. 3 years is obviously a super long time. And the sooner you met the earlier you can determine if your chemistry also works irl. I'm a little worried you are investing your time in someone that likes to stale... Like... What had he been doing the last 5 years while thinking what he wants to do? 

Try to be as realistic about this as possible even if you are in the honeymoon phase and imagine a friend would tell you this story. If one person in a relationship is not really wanting to meet their SO there is something off. You can share the amount of money it will take to get him to you or you to him. But the excuse ""don't waste it"" shouldn't be a thing in a LDR."

178,oh my.. you hit the nail on the head! I've been distancing myself from him for a couple of days now by not responding to his texts as much. He text me today asking 'why are you being weird for?'. Getting ready for the nasty phase now.
179,"What are you even doing? You are 36 with two kids and are dating a 25 year old guy who's soon going to move away. You shouldn't even burden him with your emotional stuff and either just have fun together (obviously don't introduce him to your kids) and not get too invested. If you can't do that, end this now and figure out who to manage dating as a single mother in her 30's."

192, I'm really not mad at the group. I'm upset with my boyfriend for knowing this would hurt me and still going through with it. For not being communicative about this. Sorry if that wasn't clear

195,"&gt; The brain is a complex organ and our society and interactions are very complex too. Getting some kind of brain damage (due to an accident or a tumour pressing on/in it) can really change a person. That doesn't mean that these traits were part of you and that you were a bad person all along, it just means the tumour seriously affected who you are and how you behaved.

I have been told this pretty much across the board since my diagnoses and its been pressed on by every doctor and psyc professional i've seen but its still very hard to accept. especially since i remember my thought process during that time and i know that everything i did i did on purpose. it wasn't just impulsive in the moment one off things but things that i actually put effort and planning into over a few days or weeks time. i think that is why i dont think its possible for me to ever truly believe that it wasn't 'me' doing these things. yes i know that the tumor can impact behavior but no one i have seen, no doctor even, has been able to show me how it is possible for the tumor to have been the cause of me thinking up these things or following through with them. I know logically that the tumor can impact behavior but the way i feel is that it just removed my filter so to speak and just showed everyone (including me) who i really am deep down, which is honestly a horrible person. 


i know i have to accept that my friends will never again be my friends. honestly that isnt what is the hardest. i think im really struggling because of the fact that i wont ever be able to fix what i did to them. For the last 2.5 years I have been trying nonstop to find a way to undo the damage i caused to each of them but i havent been able to. I just really wish i could change what I did and dont know how to accept that I cant."
196,Who cares? Not her. Not I. Not anyone else here.
197,She’s gonna have this thread get locked because she won’t shut up! Or he whatever it is ugh
198,"I am so sorry.  It's amazing how really immature selfish people can successfully masquerade as decent humans for a long period.  It does happen and the best of us can get fooled.  Don't blame yourself just accept that he's a jerk and let go.

There is no such thing as ""closure"" in this situation.  If you get him on the phone or face to face, he is just going to give you a bunch of bs ""I'm not sure how I feel"" ""My kids are busy that day"" blah blah blah blah.   If he were capable of ending things respectfully, he would have done so by now.  Don't expect that someone who would behave so immaturely and cowardly, is going to suddenly own up and be honest and tell you what's on his mind.  Sadly, you will likely never find out what happened.  My guess is he has a crush on someone else, but it could be anything.  Trying to find out ""what happened"" is a rabbit hole that will suck the life out of you.  Just accept that he's a bad person and move on.   

I would not try to contact him again.  It's natural you would.  He does owe you an honest conversation.  But you have no way to enforce that.  If he chooses to be a jerk, you're better off just walking away in ignorance of the details, than begging him to tell you - which he won't do anyway.  

On the plus side, he's a jerk.  So you just dodged a bullet.  You could have found out this about him after you were married.  

Again, I'm so very sorry.  I wish you and your children the best."
199,"It's a slippery slope for sure. I dont think you should get money involved in sex at all. If you want to have sex for sexs sake that's one thing. Shes violating a court order here by offering her body instead of payment. Also this is close to indentured servitude/sex slave behaviour, if you agree to it she could not fulfill her end and go to the police. Also dont take away her debt for something she already does for free."

I wonder if I will even qualify for sponsorship in that case, the documentation doesn't explicitly state any minimum income, however we suspected something like that may be the case and were intending to get declarations signed by my parents offering accomodation and financial support if needed (fortunately, they get by quite comfortably). I wouldn't want to put them in jeopardy if something like this situation did eventuate though.

Here is the thing.  If you are in the US, you should have filed for FAFSA last year as soon as they opened up enrollment.  And each of your parents would have also needed to open their own FAFSA account.  This will only determine your eligibility for federal student loans.

You will then need to apply for additional unsubsidized student loans, which will also require your parents participation. And given that you are barely 18, your parents would have to cosign those loans.

This is a requirement,  no matter what. Even if you have someone writing a check to pay the whole thing or a full rude, you and your parents will still have to file with FAFSA.

The good news is, you already know how your parents will react, so you can prepare yourself.  Come up with a plan, and work through the conflict.  I know that doesn't sound like good news, but it is.  You know what to expect, that is the hardest part.

On that same note, your parents will also discover they dropped the ball and screwed up as well.  If they are this oblivious to how college works, they're in for a very rude awakening. 

I have 2 in college currently.  One has a full ride, still had to file for FAFSA."

221,"I mean the process of eating does stimulate the intestines, and some people do take a while to poop. But if it’s taking that long he really should run it by his doctor."
222,"23 is so young, and it’s good you ended it now before you invested too much time a flushed your twenties down the toilet with the wrong person! Seriously. In a few years you’ll understand why this had to happen, because you’ll be hanging with someone else who makes you happy."
223,Sounds like he gave you the freedom of choosing whether or not you want him to come in HOPES of you choosing him to be in your life and decision.
224,"Why do you feel like I'm 'using it against you'? That indicates that you feel a bit defensive, have you thought about why? I'm not trying to put you down, here, I'm genuinely concerned by what you are expressing and the pattern in your thoughts and where your value as a person lies."
225,"They're not ""against"" you, they're just trying to help you to the best of their ability by using all the information they have access to. I agree with other commenters that you seem defensive and it's worth looking at the root of that."
226,"I grew up in a not very diverse city and I cannot IMAGINE saying anything like your boyfriend said. I chose to educate myself actively, if he has no interest in doing the same he is simply not worth your time. It is not your job to educate him. I would break up with him and find someone better who cares to learn and understand outside of his bubble."
227,"If you want to strip, that's fine.  

I would strongly suggest, though, that you do some research into the industry you are so set in joining.  Talk to some dancers, or even search for some posts on reddit where dancers talk about their job.  Read up about the issues dancers regularly face and the inherent dangers.  Make sure this is something you really want to do.

Do some research in your local area too.  Find out where the best and worst places are.  Check their security, working conditions, what they do to with tips (some force sharing) and how much it will cost you to buy outfifts (stupidly expensive), how to get insurance, deal with tax issues, and whether dancing will cover rent and bills.  

I would also strongly suggest you get some pole lessons if you haven't already.  Self-defense and awareness classes are a good option too.  Don't rely on whatever club you dance at to have your back.  In short, set yourself up for success.  Then try a dance on an amateur night.

Also be harsh with your assumptions.  From your post, you're approaching this from a perspective of sexual empowerment.  I think this has given you rose tinted glasses that you need to rip off.  Most clients will view you as a commodity and have little respect for the service you're providing.  Drugs, alcoholism and sexual abuse is rife in even the best clubs.  

You also need to accept that your career is going to have an end date.  Youth reigns supreme in these industries.  If you are going to dance and be successful, you need a *tight* budget and a will to stick to it and the discipline to keep yourself away from drugs and pimps.  You also need to decide what you're going to do after.  

Maybe you'll save up enough for a nest egg or even retirement, but it's not likely.  So, what you do then?  How do you explain the blank spaces on your resume, lasting years, to future employers?

The answer to these questions aren't easy, as I've seen after working with sex workers to help them get their life back on track.  Honestly, lying to your parents will be the least of your problems.  If you can't even live independently and maintain a simple lie, then it will be next to impossible to be successful in the industry."
228,"&gt; I could block her number but I’m going to be bumping into her again soon so it’s not like I can 100% avoid her altogether.

It doesn't matter. **Block her anyway.** The less contact the better, and if you can minimize contact by any means, do so. Blocking her on social media is fucking useless gesture if you don't finish what you started. Leaving any mode of communication open just focuses the attention on that one all the more. Get it done."
229,Thank you so much for the advise. I should be careful about my own health not so much about someone's demand.
230,"Only a selfish and mean person calls another selfish and mean. So no, you're not wrong. Your mom just has issues she's projecting onto you."
231,Have you ever been to a strip club? Talked to a stripper about what their average night is like?
232,"I have been, yes. And I realise that it’s considered a shit job but frankly, I may not even be hired. With a university arts degree, I’m not able to get a job in a supermarket or as a waitress, despite trying. So it’s another try, one that could actually feel good"
233,I mean if my “friend” made a fake sex tape of me cheating on my husband and sent it to my family members I’d be suing him and probably getting a restraining order.
234,"Unfortunately,  while you can give an explanation and they can accept it,  the consequence of what happened is that your friends probably will never forgive you. 

It might stop them from continuing on with restraining orders or similar (which it sounds like at least one of them could do and I'm surprised haven't done)  so there is that.  But they probably will never trust you in their lives again.  

Just as much as you are reeling from what happened to your life,  they are still recovering from what you did to theirs.

Accept it,  you can't force people to forget and forgive you for real things that happened.  Trauma is still trauma no matter how good the excuse you provide for it.   Rebuild your life and hope."
235,"No. I have gone back home to Canada to visit my family plenty of times solo. If he really wants to see the,m, consider having him come for a few days then fly back without you while you stay longer."
236,"No, he insisted they were just friends."
237,"Ignore her. 

Block her number. 

&gt; but I didn’t block her number in case she was suicidal again so I could at least just call 911 and still not respond.

Mistake. Just block her completely and move on."
238,Yeah your right. thanks
239,"I grew up in a small city in the mid-west where I literally didn't meet a person who wasn't white until I was in elementary school, and didn't meet a black person until high school.  I was never this weird about race.   Growing up without exposure to people of different ethnicities does not automatically make you a racist, or even someone who routinely puts their foot in their mouth.  And, knowing that I might put my foot in my mouth with some ignorance I don't even know I might not know, I'm careful to LISTEN to other people when they tell me something is problematic.  

Your boyfriend might have grown up in a racist environment, but he does not seem interested in thinking for himself about this.  Best case scenario, he's too lazy to think about the things he's been taught.  Worst case scenario, he's a gross person.   

It's not your job to raise a child to be not racist. He's an adult who is making his own choices, and he's CHOOSING to continue making racist comments."
240,"Are you kidding? EVERY BODY is the body of a burlesque dancer. I was part of the burlesque scene for a few years - there were women (and men) of every body type, every age, every persuasion. If you're assuming the Christina Aguilera film is a true representation of the scene, it couldn't be further from the truth. 

Men who go to strip clubs, on the whole, don't respect women. They're not there to make you feel wanted, to make you feel sexy or to make you feel valued. They're there to pay women to put up with them treating them like pieces of meat. 

The burlesque scene is about feeling sexy in your own body, and showing the audience how YOU feel sexy, not trying to fit into some kind of image of what other people consider sexy. And the audience alway cheers. You won't get men at a strip club thinking of how you feel. They're paying so they don't have to care."
241,"how is a blog ""private"" exactly?  Maybe I'm confused about what's being described by the OP, but if it's published on the internet then that's not a secret.  

Frankly, this doesn't sound like a healthy relationship, or one that you should want to spend any more time in.  I think by the time the three weeks is up you'll probably see that.  Think about the people you could be with who wouldn't be disloyal/cheating etc.  

What you're putting up with now is not normal."
242,"It's private in the sense that she didn't share the URL with anyone and purposefully kept it as such to use as a private space to vent. You would be incredibly hard pressed to find it and link it to her without actually going on her computer.

That being said though, I appreciate your input. We have had a history of very similar trust issues from both sides before so it's certainly not new..and definitely not healthy"
243,Don't let her discover Qanon. It's destroyed many lives.
244,"Thanks. Agree except as I told the others who replied our main issue is distance. We break up because we literally can't do anything over the phone except talk/argue. We started a no-drama policy and just don't speak when we're upset... and that makes the distance even worse. We are actually great at being friends, but the attraction is crazy strong and we want to be together 24/7.

I will just have to extend my visits to Florida to get used to the humidity, alligators and hurricanes. And the damn crime. OMG... Floridians are crazy. lol"
245,"Why on earth are you paying living expenses for someone that doesn't live with you in the first place? She's an adult, she should be able to support herself at this point in her life.

You need to just be honest with her. You're not able to continue paying her way, you want to look for a job that fulfills you in a way this one doesn't. Give her a time frame to start supporting herself--and don't drag it out for months and months. If she gets mad and breaks up with you, that's a sign she was just using you. If she loves you and cares about your well-being she'll understand."
246,"&gt; the only piece of advice I've gotten is to stop paying for her stuff, but I know she'll leave me

Of course! All you're doing here is paying for a girlfriend. That's not the way it should work. She's done quite well, really, somehow making you pay for her lifestyle, so we know she's going to do well for herself no matter what. Deft enough to wrangle some other poor bastard to support her, no question there. What you need to ask yourself is *how the fuck did you end up in this situation?* How did you get to the point of letting yourself be so used? You say she's been nice and great to you... well so is a prostitute for the hour you pay. This is just a much more expensive arrangement."

248,Hey. Thanks for your response. I think I’m definitely going to break up with him. The thought of him just makes me sick to my stomach now. He scares me. And now it’s starting to shine a light on who he is as a person.  I only see things getting worse too. I’m feeling good about leaving him just kind of in massive shock. These responses were great to make me realize that I didn’t overreact by showing up to his house and that I didn’t deserve any of that. Him joking about it really confused my emotions but now I’m sure of it. Thank you again. I’m considering going to the police too but I don’t even have a car and don’t want to involve others. I live in the city but the station is not walking distance from me

I would question taking this relationship any further unless you want to be financially supporting a guy who throws tantrums and holds grudges over shit that's his own fault."
254,"I’m not untrustworthy. And now I feel like one bad thing I did like cancelling on her today is gonna make her feel other bad things about me. Like people get mad at one thing and it becomes a huge issue. Yes I cancelled but I do care about her a lot. I wasn’t trying to hurt her. She didn’t even ask if I found my keys, if I’m ok.

261,"So you're in a more open and trusting relationship,  but he always hides his phone and you snooped through it?  There no trust in this relationship,  from either of you. He hides stuff either cause he's a liar,  incapable of respecting the boudaries of his relationship or cause he thinks you'd freak out if he talkes to other girls (even without the intent of cheating,  thought nobody can say that for sure). And you invade his privacy cause you don't trust him,  probably cause you haven't restored trust in him since the last time this happened. Basicay he just started telling you what you want to hear and got better at hiding the conversations you wouldn't be comfortable with. As for the question why he's hiding stuff and won't let you in,  you gotta ask him that."

Let her family know what she said and say you are concerned about her mental well being.

But while you do this, get a lawyer, yesterday. It may be a mental issue in which case you need to support her, but if she is planning to run away, or file for divorce, you want to be prepared more than her. 

If you think you have time. Get a PI's help and dig into what she is up to in her free time. Snoop into her Phone. Just try to figure her motivations and assess her mental health.

It can't be easy times and it may get worse but there is no alternative but to work on finding the issue and then protecting yourself. Good luck."
265,"You posted some of his flirtatious texts and then added, ""Normally, this wouldn't concern me.""

It should always concern you when your partner flirts with someone who isn't you. Know your worth.

And, yes, he's not over his ex. You're most likely a rebound. Dump him and find a better man. He's already cheating on you emotionally.

One more thing: As a guy, I'm positive your ex-boyfriend contacts you monthly only because he's trying to get back with you. Tell him you've dumped your current boyfriend (or are considering it), and he'll start texting more frequently."

If he’s respectful, doesn’t pressure you, and agrees, proceed getting to know him. As your comfort builds, and he maintains respectful NON aggressive demeanor, then work your way up, and when you actually feel ready, not pressured as guys are want to do, you should explain that you’re a virgin and want to have sex, but need him to be careful and understanding.

279,I am seeing a therapist pretty soon. Thank you for your input.
280,"He cheated on you. He didn't talk to women. He is a serial cheater. I'm sure there's more you don't know.

You should treat this exactly as you would if he was sleeping with someone. Honestly, he probably has. If you're not ok with it, set your boundaries and let him do the work to show you he deserves you. Check out the chumplady website. If he wants to sweep this under the rug, you're marriage is pretty much over. If he tells you he can do what he wants if he doesn't cross a line, leave him. He plans to continue because he knows you'll take him back."
281,So that actually didn’t happen AFTER I cancelled. That was me cancelling
282,Calling a cab would have been a TON of money. The hike is an an hour and a half away from her house.
283,Yep i agree with the outsiders (your friends).  They are telling you what they're seeing. If your spending free time with each other a lot and when your together your cuddling and such there is mutual affection on display.  I'm not great with relationships either (married at 37) been with her now for 15 years.  But that's exactly how we started out.  The 2 of you are acting like a couple already. If your afraid of losing a friendship think about her being with someone else. Besides she knows already that you LIKE like her so do it already.  You've got a very strong friendship. If it doesn't survive you asking for exclusivity in a relationship (dating).  Then she's using you for support for something else.
284,"I think you’re being harsh. 30 days isn’t very much time for a 50 year old women who can’t speak very good English, has barely any work experience to find a job. Honestly the average here in Canada and I have good experience it took me 3 months to find a good job. 
I think you should be more respectful in the cultural differences to. Lots of cultures do take care of their elders in these positions, but yeah I think it’s fair to ask her to watch the kids but the way you handled it was terrible and if I was that women I wouldn’t want to listen to you either."
285,Expecting her to keep taking you up on alternative plans after you flake on your original plans is *not acceptable adult behavior*. You're saying it like it's the most normal thing in the world.
286,"It’s over my friend, just end things on your terms."
287,"I don't think you understand that not every full-time musician is a radio pop star that tours around the country. I know many full-time musicians who do things like weddings and corporate events in addition to local bars and stuff, and they make a decent living doing that. In addition, some of them are involved in multiple bands and projects, so being a full-time musician might not be how you're imagining it."
288,"To be honest, I don't think trying to tie in the roommate story is a good idea. It sounds like a really forced excuse because what he said to her has no real connection to it. ""I smugly asked if you liked douchey men cause my roommate drank my beers."" Like, what? A sincere apology with no excuses seems like a much better approach."
289,If you would read what I sent her! I told her I couldn’t find my keys. I told her I would be there later. I cancelled when I couldn’t find them at all!
290,"Wow!   You need a huge plan.  First, 50 isn’t old.  She is probably depressed.   The three of you need to sit down and talk.  You and your spouse need to be of one mind.    Your MIL needs to find a place, she may need guidance on that and looks for a male to tell her right and wrong.  Give her a time line in writing.  Then help her by bringing any you hear of to her attention!  She will move out then with no trouble.  

The second part.... your attitude sucks!   If you treat your wife’s mom like this, how do you treat your own mom or wife!   Your attitude would be a deal breaker.   The example you are setting for your children on how to treat a loved one or how to let a loved one treat you is unnerving.   Children see and hear everything and put it away for future use!

I agree your MIL should not live with you, you just reacted poorly!"

So most people do music as a hobby as an adult... and not a full time job.  There’s a reason why 😊"

294,"Dude, protect yourself fast. Take the kids passports and burn them. You can. Get new ones later, but just get rid of them completely, don’t let her have that. 

You have evidence you didn’t cheat, she has no proof you did. She’s probably wanting to find some dirt on you so she can win in a divorce. And she may be cheating on you, actually. 

Sounds like she’s not being rational about it so good news is she’s shooting herself in the foot here. I don’t think anybody is going to believe her if she’s telling stories and you’re calling them to confirm that she’s being crazy"
295,I don't think that statement is true tbh
296,"&gt; I don't know how to disarm my feelings of monogomous relationships.

Disarm? You feel what you feel, and whatever else is going on in your relationship, monogamy is the norm when it comes to relationships, not the exception. This isn't something to suddenly be uncomfortable with. If your partner wants to explore being with other people then the whole deal needs to be reconsidered. It wasn't cool to be all over her friend, whether you're right there or not. This isn't the first time she's done this? Then you both need to sit down and work out where you're at. Pronto."
297,"There’s psychologists that specialize in cheating and they can tell you, a lot of times it has literally nothing to do with the partner or the primary relationship at all. Monogamy and polyamory aren’t predisposed in us, they are choices, and that means we are fully capable of loving and being attracted to multiple people as a species. 

A lot of times people cheat because they’re bored with their whole life. Work isn’t fulfilling, they’re getting older, they thought things would be different. 
He could be perfectly happy with his real partner but he’s missing that new relationship energy, which doesn’t mean his relationship is bad. It’s an issue with him. He’s not capable of accepting that relationships change. He could leave his girlfriend for this friend and then in 6 years fall in love with somebody new because he’s not capable of being satisfied with anything, he’s just wanting to pine most likely. I don’t believe he’s in love with a woman he talks to 6 times a year. I think he’s convincing himself he is to have some drama in his life"
298,"You don’t need to have sex to know yourself, I really don’t think you do. I consider myself bi but I’m with a man and that’s all I want, because my identity isn’t wrapped up in who makes my genitals twitch. Being with a woman wouldn’t/shouldn’t change who you are as a person, I don’t think. Do whatever you want, but I’m just saying it’s weird to basically prepare for cheating on him/leaving him for somebody else and say it’s not that you want that to happen but you have to think about it and plan for it?? No you don’t. That’s like me planning a weekend trip with a friend I’m attracted to and being like “ok, I don’t want to screw him and ruin my relationship, but I have to prepare for it right?” You don’t. You choose who you love. Love isn’t just first time emotions. Love is consistency. And if you’re willing to throw away a relationship with a man that’s dedicated so much for you just because you had warm feelings after sex 1 time, I’d say you’re priorities of a relationship aren’t that healthy or realistic. 

I’m glad you found a person that’s willing to work trough this with you."

303,Is he normally immature and prone to throwing tantrums?
304,If anything you have a drinking problem.
305,Just let him be pissed off by himself. You go with your family and enjoy it!
306,Shes not mature enough to handle a child if this is how she reacts to you saying you need time. Three months in is way too fast. Definitely a red flag. If it's that much of a rush it seems more of a trap than a life that should be created out of love.
307,"I guess you might as well make a move. If you sit around having feelings for this girl and never do it, it's just going to stew like a pressure cooker until one day, she'll introduce you to her new boyfriend and you'll explode and nuke your friendship anyway.

If she's really not into you, it's partly her fault for giving you mixed signals. You told her you had feelings for her, and she turned you down and wanted to just be friends. It's on her to not be all touchy-feely and shoving her face half an inch from yours while laying on top of you when you specifically told her that you have feelings for her."
308,"Not black. But, you did right thing in trying to get them away from beaten kid. Rhat it did not worked out does not diminish it. They used race to blow you away, because it works and it would not be surprising for violent kid to treat people differently based on eace. If you was black, they would not listened to you either, because they intended to be violent anyway.

I don't think you can do anything now, it is week later and there is no one to confirm your story anyway."
309,Calculate the money you are losing not being able to airbnb the space.  Add the cost of hiring a nanny. Estimate the increase in electric/water bill for having a full time tenant. Then ask Estelia to explain how your family is going to make up for the cost of her mother.

312,"Dude, hold your ground or the boundaries will continually move.  I know from first hand experience. My Ethnic MIL was to come and live with us. She was supposed to live in our finished basement part time. She lives upstairs in a bedroom and stays here full time. This and several other issues nearly led to divorce."
313,"I’d say everyone sucks here. Your MIL obviously sucks for being entitled, rude and unhelpful. Your wife sucks at communication skills with both you and her mother. You suck for general belittling attitude."
314,I asked her yesterday if she could drive and she said she couldn’t because she needs to get a new tag for her car cause she just started a new job and had to wait to get paid for a tag. So I was gonna be the one driving! Second I texted her and told her I can make it up to her and she didn’t even respond
315,"Personally, I’m very close friends with my ex of 3 years. We were best friends for years and after we broke up we still talk everyday and have done for over a year now. I still use his Netflix account, just bc I don’t wanna make one for how little I use it. So ex’s can be purely platonic friends. 

However, if I was to get a partner I’d be open about it. The fact your boyfriend is hiding things or gets defensive about talking about her is a bad sign. If there’s nothing more than platonic close friends, he shouldn’t have anything to hide from you."
316,You are in an abusive relationship. Therapy only works if the person wants to change. Best of luck to you.
317,Deal going now
318,I would never skip out on a family vacation to cater to my boyfriend’s family ego. He is choosing not to come and wants to pull a power move by getting you not to go either.
319,"Slow down! Your girlfriends reaction to your doubts is ridiculous for sure, but why the hell would you even agree to such a stupid suggestion in the first place? I once read a comment on here that in a new relationship you should never plan to do something that would happen further away than the amount of time you have been together. It was more eloquent than that but it's mostly true. Especially true when it comes to a decision like having a baby. Babies are stressful as hell, they test the strongest of fully established long term relationships. I'm actually wondering (if this post is even real) if either of you have ever been in an actual long term relationship before, i.e. a relationship measured in years not months. Nothing wrong if you haven't, just thinking it might explain the rose coloured glasses  and stupid reactions involved here. Especially as you use the word ""always""  to describe 3 months. Most adults would probably consider you too as having just met."
320,"Yep. Everyone cooperates and contributes. Multi generational homes are common in cultures *where they literally can't afford to live separately* so anyone who doesn't have a job does housework, childrearing, cooking, gardening. 

Even in wealthier households where they can afford servants, anyone not working out of the home is expected to contribute. This will often look more like charity work and showing up in society to maintain your family's status and ties.  

No reasonable, healthy adult expects to be allowed to do absolutely no work or contribution while others pay their way."

You are a trash person. Goodbye."
323,"Exactly. Becoming successful in his career means this problem is only going to get worse, not better."
324,"Yeah, I think that you were the problem in that situation as much as your friend.  If she already had plans with him, he deserves precedence and I think that a change of plans like this is pretty normal.  As for your other friend flaking out, I find that kind of thing annoying as an oldster, but I think it's pretty normal these days.  I agree with the other poster that you'd do well to learn how to defeat the voice that's telling you that normal social snafus are something deeper."
325,"I would amicably leave my dude- I am dealing with similar issues. The absolute worst thing you can do is stay with someone out of habit.  I would smile and leave and work on myself. You were very young when you first met and that is okay and normal. Everyone goes through this-but consider yourself lucky. You didn't get cheated on-you aren't married with 2 kids with no way to support them- your wife hasn't gone crazy-you haven't had all your money taken away from you in a divorce. Reality is that women are human just like men-and they can absolutely suck as much as men. Consider this- if you truly want to get married.

You or your spouse gets maimed in a car accident and cannot work or walk without assistance for an extended period of time- would you love her and stay with her through it? These things do happen my friend, and if you have any inkling that person will bounce when the going gets tough(you lose your job, you lose a child, death of a parent)- you need to leave and find someone who will. Let me tell you- marriage is great in some aspects but it is NOT everything it is cracked up to be- there are times when you will hate one another, when you hate your life, when stuff is going to shit around you. You want to be with someone who will love you for YOU-regardless of you being a CFO or janitor. This person does not seem to be that person- I wish you and her all the best my friend."

327,"I don’t mind waiting, He’s my best friend and I value that very highly. I just don’t want to be with someone who has to future plan with me. I’m very worried about being disposable. (Not that I think I’m a disposable person) just don’t want to be seen that way, I really appreciate the response (I’ve got some anxiety issues so that contributes to a lot of it.) But He’s someone I think would make a great husband"
328,It sucks but doesn't seem like a huge deal. Some people just like to talk to others outside there relationship and don't feel the need to explain themselves. If its not inappropriate then no worries.
329,"We have words like ""Adolescent"", ""teenager"", and ""Young woman"" to differentiate between 16 year olds and 6 year olds. Intentionally using more emotionally loaded language when more accurate terms are available is intellectually dishonest, I think.

The mother does have a legal right to do that, but that doesn't make inflicting moral panic on one's child any less inappropriate. In some States, parents have a right to hit their children, do you think that means it's ok?"

334,"JFC.  I hope you're not considering hitching your wagon to this guy.
1.  Broke at 28 years old;  2.  Selfish;  3.  Always gonna be broke; 5.  Broke at 28 years old;  6.  Did I mention BROKE and probably always will be?"
335,"And rinse them out before you throw them away. 

Although honestly, OP...3 months in, with red flags and she's talking about having your kid? I say run before it's too late."
336,I told her let’s leave later. I even offered her to go on a jog instead later. She didn’t even acknowledge
337,"When you are talking 5 years on one side and 10 on the other, and when one relationship is close by and the other in a different town. Well it is classic grass is greener on the other side. My bet is you will flip again.

But anyways there is no advise here. You need to do what make sense to you. You already know the pros and cons."
338,Wanting to have a baby isn't an indication of how disinterested a person will be as a parent.
339,Because he isn't showing his feelings to you
340,"Three months is enough time to feel passionately in love someone to the point that your brain believes that there has never been, nor ever could be again, someone that clicks with you as well as your current partner. It is not enough time to make long-term decisions with them though. Imagine a committee where every member is a future version of yourself from each year of your life until the end. Would each version of you agree that irrevocably connecting yourself to someone through having a child, or having a child at this time and with this person, is a good decision? Probably not.

Another thing to be wary of is that she wants to make this lifelong commitment to you after just 90 days. Be careful with someone who makes such grand commitments so carelessly. They either overcommit to everyone and don't follow through, or have no intention of following through in the first place.

Finally, you expressed incredibly valid concerns that you two are moving too fast. Instead of rationally working through what was on your mind she threw a tantrum, refused to speak to you, and physically shut you out. Not only is this a blatant disregard for your feelings, but people are almost always on their best behavior in the earliest parts of any relationship and relax it gradually from there. This is the kind of communication that you can probably expect from her going forward.

Do not delude yourself. See the red flags. What you described is a potentially dangerous relationship for you. Best of luck out there."
341,"Yea, pretty much this if OP decides to stay.  Massive red flag flapping in her face.

The BF is acting incredibly childish for a 30 year old."
342,"&gt;My BF can’t take the time off because he’s broke and is working on becoming a full time musician so he needs to be able to take any gig he can get so he said he couldn’t come.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;How do I deal with this?

Find a boyfriend who is more emotionally mature and has his shit together."
343,"I wouldn't give him excuses or try to rational things yourself. Sounds like the argument had nothing to do with his weight but that's what you want it to be. Instead you'll need to talk to him about the issue at hand. Even if he's down about his weight, doesn't give him the ok to mistreat you."
344,"Well, that’s why I asked instead of reacting purely out of anger. I really don’t have any ill will towards her."
345,It doesnt sound like you are closer to the group if you werent invited
346,"yes! tell her! she deserves to know! i’m so sorry you had your heart broken. she will be devastated, but she needs to know."
347,"Sucks to be you man, sorry. Stuck with someone bad at communicating and handling her emotions. If you want to make this work, which I assume you do because you have a child together, then something like couples counceling might be a good idea only if she refuses to just communicate with you normally. It might sound extreme but this will get worse otherwise."
348,"I do have feelings for her. We've talked about our feelings for each other before. I know I'm making her hate me right now, she's even told me even if she makes the decision she's gonna resent me for the rest of her life. I care more about her wellbeing than the prospect of being with her. The ultimatum though has nothing to do with a relationship. I'm just not gonna watch her hurt herself anymore and pretend it's not gonna happen."

350,You absolutely need to tell her. Imagine what else he may be hiding.

353,"He has made progress since you have been with him.  It is fixable, but you need to sit down and talk to him about this.  He seems to be the type that doesn't understand or pick up on social cues at all.  You might have to guide him with this and be very direct with him.  I think that he would be willing to change overall."
354,"For sure! What about traveling, taking a job in another city, pursuing other sexual interests, not feeling obligated to answer to someone, etc. ?"
355,"Ask her if she meant anything by it. If you can't ask her casually in person (since you still see her on occasion?) , then ask her by text, since you have her number.

Worst-case, she's not interested, you move on. But if she is interested, this could lead somewhere fun?"
356,"Okay. I can understand a hesitation or a resistance to therapy. She may have had a bad experience at one. However, I must say not seeking treatment or a qualified diagnosis for a problem doesnt mean you are not suffering with a mental health problem. Having a label of mental illness doesn't happen because someone has sought professional help. If she is stating she has more than one personality that she cannot control, is having extreme memory lapses, and is under additional stresses, it is a serious situation. If she is in fact having psychotic events or feels as if more than one personality lives inside of her, none of it is a matter of cheating. It is a matter of her having something happening to her that she no longer has control of herself or her actions. She could genuinely get hurt. 

It isn't a matter of loving or not loving her. It's a matter of dismissing or excusing the behavior as reasonable. It is unreasonable behavior, and if she is stressed about it and regretful it happens and she cannot control it, then the loving thing to do is to continue to encourage help for it. 

You can forgive the behaviors that occurred, but the underlying issues that causes the behavior still has to be addressed or it may happen again."
357,Forget what might happen. Tell her what happened. Then leave it at that. It's not your place to fix a broken family. You just got caught up with the wrong dude
358,"My rule of thumb is that it's not cool to lie, and best to stay out of others business.
That being said, this guy put you in a really tricky situation. She has a right to know, but is it best to learn from you? Morally paradoxical.
I have friends who are a couple and I see one partner cheat with another friend of mine and I'm just expected to lie for my one friend. I think to myself ""just leave me out of this, I don't even want to know""
Are your intentions out of looking after a stranger or because you are angry with this man? If it's the latter, probably best to leave it alone, imo."
359,"He has a drinking problem, possibly a drug problem with Adderall and he has cheated on you as well as you hating the fact that he watches porn.  If you want to save this marriage you will need marriage counseling."
360,See? Happy ending. TELL HER. My boyfriend has raised my daughter with me over the last 3 year's. Her dad walked out when she was an infant. She calls my boyfriend daddy. I found out not long ago he had a full blown relationship with a girl much younger than he is for the last year behind my back. I wanted to kill him &amp; her. She knew about me and my daughter and could've been woman enough to tell me.
361,"Disclosure - 37yr old male here. I've had my playboy days for sure, but there is no way, on God's green earth, that I would lie to my wife, my family, another loving and trusting soul and her family for an entire year. Cheating on your wife to begin with is a no go. You should absolutely tell his wife. Actions equal consequences and responsibility."

366,"Yeah, that's what I feel as well. It's kind of hot-and-cold. She can be super affectionate but also a bit distant at times. So I'm not sure if she wants me to give her attention while she's being distant, or she just wants to be left alone.

Yeah, it is a bit difficult, but its not so extreme that she's  harming herself or is suicidal, as far as I know. I've got a pretty sturdy mental so I can tolerate a lot.

Thanks!"
367,"It feels like the wife is in on this.

With only the one point of view here there's no way to know for sure, but I highly suspect that the wife told the mom that she could move in and she would just take care of her husband and he would deal with it.

Otherwise I suspect the reactions would have been quite different."
368,"He's probably trying to cover his tracks with his wife now. Let her know. If he tries to spread nudes, make sure you have knowledge of revenge porn laws in your state on hand. Have a nice chat with his wife, with evidence. Here's to hoping you don't need to make use of the police or a victim's advocate. Best of luck!"
369,have you considered her saying you aren't ready is putting you down gently? move on and grow naturally. if you force it just to have a girlfriend then you haven't really grown.
370,"I couldn't disagree more, my boyfriend and I have been together for 10 years, and we both have friendships outside of the relationship, I actually think it's more healthy to have independent lives within the relationship."
371,The old relationships are all burned with the exception of the one friend.  You are probably better off moving someplace and starting a new life if you can.  Otherwise just make new friends in your area.

374,"As hard as it will be for everyone, she deserves to know. Please don't blame yourself, he's the problem here. Good luck OP, I'm sorry you got put into this situation."
375,I’m not and never have expected anyone to pay. My dad is insistent and sees this as a big thing he wants to give me. Yes they’re very well off. My dad got cut because of political issues.  They won’t go into debt - I did my mum’s will with her. For some reason fiancé is refusing to listen to me. I’ve never asked my parents for anything and I am not asking this of them. My father would be very upset if he is not allowed to give what he wants to me. It would his pride very much.
376,"Again, you don't know their relationship. Contacting her may be cathartic for you, but devastating for her."
377,He violated your boundaries. You feel violated. This man violated your boundaries
378,I’d say right this minute it’s like 70% anger and 30% caring that I was part in something that will hurt her and thinking she deserves to know
379,That does not apply here. She clearly stated that they are both friends with the group.
380,"Yeah, maybe a break is a good idea. I just worry about losing a friend on top of losing a lover, know what I mean?  Thanks for the reply."
381,"Idk exactly, I didn't want to be seen as guy? I don't know how to say it. I just feel I guess? I like being a girl. 

About antiandrigens, be careful bc it can induce depression due to lack of sexual hormones. Endocrinologists aren't necessarily up with latest hrt recommendations, so try to find a discussion group with trans feminine/women so you don't go in this blindly :)"

Maybe I just misread , but if it is the case: I questioned my gender, find out I'm cis. My gf did, she's now on hrt and so much happier. You can date when you're trans and some couple where the other partner isn't bi survive. Whatever, good luck :)"
391,I have said these things. Sometimes the right way and sometimes I don’t handle it as well as I should.
392,"Why do you have such a difficult time accepting that a tumor could cause you to behave in the way that you did? As someone outside the situation, it doesn’t seem far fetched at all. Your close friend, who knows you, was convinced that there was a medical reason for your behavior, and they were correct. Doctors have also confirmed that your condition was responsible.

Perhaps you could do some research to learn about other people who have had similar experiences due to a brain tumor. Is there a support group you could join? 

I understand your pain and regret, and I sympathize. It seems to me you have a choice: continuing to suffer and linger in the past, or choosing to create a new life for yourself. Perhaps you could volunteer somewhere - acts of service are beneficial for your well-being. Do some yoga. Take up gardening. Move forward.

I hope you can forgive yourself for what was outside of your control. You are worthy of a good life, full of love and friendship. Sending you best wishes for a fulfilled life."
393,its not like every nasa picture is fake she just says SOME of it is fake and that its dumb to blindly trust such a big organization 100% when theres all this money and stuff involved... that is how she talks now.
394,my friend who is more science inclined explained this shadow triangulation (thats what he called it) thing to her at my house and she said that would still happen on a flat earth if the sun was closer than we think. my friend thought all this was kind of hilarious because he said her explanations make sense but that she is still being really stupid about it all. trying that angle just made it worse.
395,"&gt;I have no idea how to approach this sensitively in a way hes not going to snap at me. 

If you aren't allowed to express yourself there's no way you can stay in this relationship and be happy."
396,"&gt;I have no idea how to approach this sensitively in a way hes not going to snap at me.

How often does he snap at you?   It should not be a problem for you to tell him that you do not want to be touched while you are sleeping.  Once you tell him to stop, it should stop immediately.   If he gets mad, snaps or refuses to stop then it's a giant red flag and you should treat it as such."
397,I’m so sorry you had this happen.  I have a similar situation and no idea what to do.   Either way love your kids and know you are not the damaged crazy one.  We are the ones that have to deal with it.    So unfair.  And so insane!   Good luck
398,"Pretty much exactly what I was thinking.

Top guess would be IBS. After that, bulimia or drug addiction. But it could also be something much more unexpected, like being addicted to a mobile game or online gambling or something. 

The strange part is that he doesn't find it odd. So he's either totally unashamed of it, or he's losing track of time. That being the case, I would *maybe* say it isn't an eating disorder or drug addiction, just because if either of those were what was going on then he would likely be trying to hide it and be a bit more careful with his bathroom time - but that's not exactly a certainty, so can't rule them out for sure. But I think I'm gonna go with IBS or online gambling for this. As you said, only one way to find out."
399,"It’s always easier on the outside looking in, it is clear you should be done with his guy. You’re 18, there’s a lot life ahead of you and done let him trick you any further."
400,"GO UP TO HIM, SAY HELLO, ASK HIS NAME, AND TELL HIM YOURS.

He is a human being. This is a normal thing to do."
401,Do you mean break up?
402,"I mean, my first thought is ""you make him understand how rude and offensive it is by leaving him"". Some things aren't a red flag, they're a red light, and the appropriate response to the them is ending the relationship."
403,I really appreciate ur input and definitely get what ur saying. I am aware I don’t know him well... and I am fully aware what heart break feels like and went through some really traumatic shit growing up. So I know I don’t know everything but I like to think I know quite a bit especially about myself honestly. And it’s not like he’d hold me back. I will leave no matter what cause this move is very important which he’s aware of and fully supportive and tells me go do it and make ur dreams and goals come true
404,"&gt;Moving things so I think I’m crazy

Charles Manson did this, before the murders. Just broke into homes to move things around weirdly.

I had a kid with a guy like that.... Don't stay that song change ... he's still doing the same stuff lost his latest gf over the same thing .. some people just don't get it"
406,"What I want to know, is how the hell men are able to find escorts so often. Is there some kind of underworld that women are completely unaware of?"
407,She’s eventually going to leave you when you can no longer afford to pay her expenses or when she finds a sugar daddy with more money than you. Might as well cut your losses now...

At their age, they probably have wives and children they want to protect and can’t risk it if they forgive you.  What if the tumor came back and you tried to have sex with one of their children?  You are essentially expecting them to put your friendship ahead of the safety of their families.  Their unwillingness doesn’t mean they hate you.  Move on and get new friends."
434,"If there is no visible signs of problems with his health, let him talk to you about it in his own time. He could just be having a problem opening up about something, or he might be hiding something, but unless it interferes with your relationship, I wouldn't spend much time thinking seriously about it."
435,"Does he drink a lot (of alcohol)? When I was going through alcoholism I would need to poop as soon as I ate, it would travel straight through me and I would have the acid runs every day after every meal. My partner and I once had a fight about it because she said she felt like she couldn't go anywhere or do anything with me because we would have to work around me going to the toilet."
436,"I don't know what you said 4 years ago, or what he said 4 years ago, but you should divorce him, because nobody should have to put up with abuse of any kind, and it could get worse if you don't get out now, when he's offering you the out.  I don't know you personally but I don't want anything bad to happen to you, or in a worst case scenario, for you to be killed.  He's made it known that he wants to hurt you, please leave before he does."
437,"i know that feeling of holding on to what someone once was. it’s painful when reality isn’t that anymore. and you can hold on to that appreciation of those things, but what you’re living now and will keep living if you stay, just isn’t deserved. that’s beneath you at minimum."
438,Agree with this. And your therapy isn’t helping you - find another therapist.
439,"I think the thing is with you guys is that there’s a two year age gap, there’s 12 year gap here. She met him when he was still basically a kid and started dating him pretty soon after and tbh I find that a little creepy. The difference between you and your spouse (congratulations btw 27 years is a hella long time) is that you guys are close in age and at the same mental point in your life, OP is over a decade older than her boyfriend which again I find a little weird."
440,"I agree with you, but she may not be thinking about it that way. Our society treats the freedom and independence of being single as something glamorous, and important for personal development, that can’t be obtained with a partner. It’s all romanticized fantasies, and it can go to a person’s head. Maybe she needs to think about exactly what she truly feels she is missing, and then assess whether that is something she can do with OP still in her life, and if not, why. I think to jump to the conclusion that sex is what she’s after just because she wants to do this is making a big assumption."
441,"Well, that changes a lot.

Sounds like neither of you have actually moved on and are still basically acting like you're in a relationship.

You should stop going over, you're being cruel to her as it seems like she's trying to be noticed by you/keep going as normal."

445,"Jesus Christ. This dude is almost 30 and can’t afford a FREE vacation because he’s chasing some wild childish dream of being a “musician” and has no realistic life plans. He turned down the FREE vacation several times yet is mad at you for not staying behind with him? Why does he need you to suffer from his failures with him? 

What a fucking loser. I’m embarrassed for you, OP. Get a new boyfriend."
446,"Be mature and confront her about it while possibly looking for other housing in the background just in case. If she’s a good friend she’ll understand that it’s just out of your ability to party all the time and that you can’t afford it. If not well, she may try to make your life hell which is why I recommend looking for other options in the background."

448,He's really been very cruel here.
449,"&gt; What about Estefi? What should I tell her? She thinks we can all get along with her Mother not paying rent and we living life as usual.

One thing you could do is ask her to prove it.

Both of you make up your own budget. You break down how much you're losing in revenue, the wear and tear on the place, how much childcare will cost, and then show what that will do to the rest of your budget. 

If she can show that *she alone* can make sacrifices that will in no way detract from the rest of the family. (So no asking the kids to quit activities, you to cancel your gym membership, the family to skip planned vacations, etc)

We recently had a woman whose husband was spending $1k/month on food. It was entirely from his personal ""fun money"" stash, though. If you two happen to be well off enough that her personal ""discretionary money"" can cover her moms stay... Well then she's right to use her money that way."
450,"If she wants everyone to think you're cheating for custody [this isn't a thing where I live, so IDK], wouldn't she be telling everyone you are cheating? Instead, she's told NO ONE. I could see if she was running to her family and crying about fake cheating, poor her, crocodile tears, etc., but she's NOT lying to them.  

And if she wants to make this fake case that you're cheating, why is she making the case to YOU? You know you didn't cheat. 

This sounds pretty manic with that missing money (and wouldn't you be *invited* to your BIL's wedding?) or like a mental break. In the span of one conversation, she lied about your cheating with the coworker, 3 teachers, the friends' girl, the neighbor, *and* then threw in just vague ""people in and out"" of the house.

That's freaking EXTREME. In this sub, we've read about people who are paranoid their SO is cheating and are constantly getting accused...but she saying she has proof, wait no, wait, more proof, wait no...

I'd be worried about her mental health. But you do need to CYA in case she does have some weird plan. 

- So, yes, hide the passports. 

- Call her brother and ask about his nuptials. If he IS getting married, okay. If he is *not* getting married, she needs to tell you where a TON of money went. 

- Whether or not he is getting married, then call her parents because you need that money back. And if she lied to use that money for plane tickets/lawyer, her parents need to know. If she's unwell, they need to know she bought 10,000 rabbits' feet or whatever. 

- Call a lawyer. 

(Oh, and she can't ""forbid"" you from driving the car. That one's like, easy.)"
451,Exactly. Also provide proof as the wife will probably not believe it.
452,I have anxiety as well! And I couldn’t find my keys!
453,"I’d love to think this way, but I can’t really stand going on like this without knowing about how she feels about me and if it could be more. Relationships will only grow if someone makes a move, which is one of the few things I know. I want to ask because it kind of hurts to be stuck in this zone where I don’t know if the feeling is mutual or if I’m just imagining things."
454,"I'd say the one thing I learned from my past relationship is spending more together time, and listen to my gf more.  It was also a toxic relationship, but looking back, toxicity aside, when I find someone that matches and isn't toxic, do those 2 things more."
455,If you already had this issue and he's just gone and done the same thing again I guess it's up to you if you want to give him a third chance or just breakup. He clearly learnt nothing from the first time this happened. Also why did your friends invite him and not you? Both times? If you are both friends with that group you should be invited together so either you are not as close with them as you think or he is telling them you are unavailable before they have a chance to ask you.
456,Ok .... but if a friend cut you off for canceling because they said don’t cancel.... you wouldn’t think she was being a brat
457,"You don’t trust him

It’s obvious or your wouldn’t be snooping on the phone

You weren’t even an adult when you started dating so you have never been an independent, single self sufficient adult

Break it off go live your life.  There’s plenty of fish in the sea.  The only problem is you’ve never been fishing."
458,"My advice don't ask her out just let the things as they are. If you will ask her out it would probably ruin your friendship and you also. 
You said you guys cuddle then what's the problem dude just enjoy the chemistry between you and your lovely friend.
Soft hearted people with pure soul like you usually need a caring partner and they usually pick these small signals and try to relate it to dating. 
Dude enjoy your sweet relationship with her if it is mutual love then it will end up well you just relax and respect yourself and your friend. 
Bless your friendship ❣️❣️"
459,"Maybe just do some research and find some links about things partners need to discuss before having a baby. You haven't celebrated a holiday together yet, met each others families so I dont know how much you couldve discussed how you want to raise a child in terms of discipline, religion or what kind of life you want them to have in terms of schooling and extra curriculars. Tell her you just want your child to have the best quality of life and you want to bring them into the best home you can and the best way to do that is to iron these things out and take a little more time getting to know each others families before you lock into an 18+yr commitment."

461,"Just dump him, he is probably not interested enough in you... Just leave him"
462,"To be honest, this sounds really all over the place and I think it probably would be for the best if you stayed broken up. You sound like you have some maturing to do and he sounds like he’s just not in a stable place in life.

You said you would change your ways for him - but haven’t you already tried to do that, by going to therapy and making progress? If you did that for yourself and him, why hasn’t he tried to put in any effort to change HIS ways of lack of communication for YOU? Why would he not be understanding of you being upset about a friend bringing up his sexual past when A) most people don’t want to hear about that part of their ex and B) you’d asked her not to bring it up already? Don’t you think it’s weird he was not on your side about that? 

I dunno, man, like I said. You are working on bettering yourself and he sounds like he just has zero clue how to handle any kind of stress and that is not a good match. I know you love him but you are 19 - the likelihood of this guy being the person you’re going to marry is EXTREMELY unlikely, especially if he’s going to keep all his thoughts and feelings shut in and then blame you for his own shortcomings. Relationships are mostly communication. You say he left because of stress - but why is he getting so stressed over the Amazon and the president when these are things he can’t control, and he’s letting himself get to the point of being so stressed he breaks up with you? People say things all the times during break ups but in my experience, they’re saying it out of guilt or trying to change their own minds. He didn’t break up with you because of stress. He broke up with you because he wanted to.

And I get that that isn’t natural for everyone, don’t get me wrong; I’ve really had to work with my SO on getting him to tell me how he feels and it’s been 1.5 years of work that will continue on as long as we are together, because relationships are hard work. It’s hard to communicate. But you do it so you can have a healthy and honest relationship. This guy sounds like that’s the least of his worries. He wants to hold everything in and then explode and then blame you for it? He said he wants to break up and from what your post says, sounds to me like he 110% means it. Other people can say as much as they want, “oh that isn’t like him at all! He’s being so impulsive!” Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the point is he made the decision to break up and it seems very clear to me that he does not really want to reconcile. 

I really am voting for you staying broken up. You are young and I know it hurts, but you are on a journey of bettering the person that you are becoming and I think your relationship with yourself is the one you need to focus on right now. And hopefully next time around, you find a guy who is emotionally mature enough to tell you when he’s got a problem. Let yourself grow, and let this guy go."
463,"Thank you. What kind of selfish-ass grandmother refuses to watch her own grandkids for a few hours a day, in exchange for *living free*? 

Hell, I'd take that deal, and I'm not even related."
464,"Your mother is abusive and you're dating a child. Leave both situations and grow up. 

You have kids to look out for. Do you want them around your mother? She'll abuse and insult THEM too. Ask me how I know. Your BF *might* make good money when he graduates. Just about every field on earth is flooded with new Bachelorette degree grads 24/7 365. I did everything ""right"" in college. Perfect GPA. Internships. Research. Study abroad. Peer mentoring. Extracurriculars. You name it. I killed myself in school to excel. 

Aaaaaaand I'm unemployable in the field I went to school for. EVERYTHING requires an advanced degree. 

Instead I'm making double what I would in any entry level job in my field of study with a certificate program that cost me $2k. Dragging around $40k of student loan debt for a useless degree. 

You need a reality check. Like now. YOUR BOYFRIEND IS 22!!! In college, he is a BOY, and you have children. Which you're exposing to an abusive narcissist and hoping ""someday"" the kid you're dating will be able to support you. 

Fucks sake."
465,"He is being selfish and self absorbed. He could be saying the same thing in 20 years! If I was him I wouldn't want you to miss out on the opportunity, not sit at home sulking because of a choice I made."
466,"He is looking for a hook up, and doesn't respect boundaries, this is not the guy for you. Do not go over to his house, I'd tell him you aren't interested."
467,"There's a fundamental interpersonal power imbalance between a guy pushing 30 and a pubescent teenager, a power imbalance that just doesn't exist between two people the same age, regardless of race. 16-year-olds are notoriously bad judges of character. They're still developing their personalities, their senses of right and wrong, etc. For all the mother knows this guy could be grooming her daughter and the daughter could be eating it up. Whether or not he is isn't the point: the point is that she doesn't know anything about this guy and because her daughter is still socially and developmentally a child, she can't trust her daughter to recognize the potential danger *whether or not it exists*. This isn't two equally clueless or equally savvy people meeting each other on even ground. An adult can convince a child of damn near anything if the child is receptive to it. 

So no, it's really not at all the same as two 16 year old kids, one black, one white, playing basketball on the weekends. And if the mother in that scenario were to stop her kid being friends with a black boy, we'd rightly see that as racist. Because, and I can't stress this enough, there's no fundamental difference between two people at the same developmental age. There is a fundamental difference between an adult and a teenager. This is why we have age limits on diving, drinking, smoking, voting, joining the military, and so on. 

I want to emphasize that I'm not saying the OP was up to anything sketchy, but the mother has no way of knowing that. All she knows is her still-developing daughter was spending time with a fully-developed adult stranger, and recognized that her daughter was probably not mature enough to navigate a relationship like that without supervision."

469,"Go see her brother and parents now. Tell them everything. I am sure 3 teachers from your kids school did not tell her this, I've worked in schools and have teacher friends, the last thing they will do is tell a spouse about cheating, they want to avoid getting involved, trust me.

She's up to something, get the passports and freeze accounts if you can.

She sounds like a friend of mine who had a huge change in behavior, she had a brain tumor. I'm more inclined 5i think she's either cheating herself or been watching too many lifetime movies."
470,"If you do decide to tell her, be prepared - have receipts, and make sure you are ready to deal with the blow back from possibly both of them."
471,Why not ask one of the group that you are closest too why you were not invited ?  Say you would have love to go on future events like this and see what they say - maybe you were invited and he didn’t want you there ?
472,Oh please do not marry someone who is not only pressuring you but putting a price tag on your relationship
473,"So... yes? If I am attractive, safe to assume I can't have friends who are boys even when I'm in a serious relationship? I really don't want to accept that. But I also really don't want to be put in this position again, so do I have to?"

475,"I mean ok, you're right but that's just how the world works. We don't all live in NYC or a city that has good public transportation that we could take instead of a car, we can't all have a designated driver every single time we go out and cabs are downright unnafordable most of the time."
476,Sure. But this dude is flat broke so...
477,"I mean about hiding the phone, it’s shady but I do the same just because I don’t want anybody looking through my phone no matter who, I have like 3 people I text and 4 photos of turtles but I just like my privacy. But to be fair in the most ideal situation here (and the one I’m hoping for): he’s in contact with this ex of his and is in a completely platonic relationship that he just finds uncomfortable to discuss with you because he’s unsure how it would make you feel. On the worse side (and the more realistic here): he’s planning on (or already has been) cheating. Please sit him down for a serious chat and tell him to tell you what you want to know."
478,"Holding you down is physical abuse. Please stop seeing this man. Going over to his house along is likely going to put you at high risk of sexual assault. He’s shown you that he doesn’t care about you as a person and thinks your boundaries don’t matter. 

It’s only been two weeks; a text saying you aren’t interested in seeing him anymore is sufficient and safest."
479,Your girl seems to harbour a lot of irrelevant resentment towards you. I don't think she's really mad about the little things. I think something bigger is the issue. Try asking her what's really wrong.
480,"I don’t think of it as taking away from my children at all. And I think that’s cultural. It would be my mother. It’s not about money. Also, having grandparents in the household is awesome. Nobody loves children like grandparents. Spoils them, plays with them...


I don’t think there is anything wrong with taking care of parents as they’ve sacrificed themselves time and over again. After raising children for 18+ years, giving everything, I think it’s appalling and sad to look at them as $$ or leeches. It’s disrespectful of the love and opportunity they’ve provided. 

I come back to culture repeatedly. It’s an old broken record but a valid one."
481,"It sounds to me like if you genuinely want to stay broken up with this person, you need to take a big step back. Did you just recently break up and then continue hanging out? Sometimes you need to take a break from interacting with a person to really start moving on. 


Unless you actually don't want to break up or want some kind of FWB situation, it is not a good idea for you to be hanging out with your naked ex and thinking about how hot she is. There are certain boundaries that are necessary for a platonic friendship between exes and you both need to be on board with enforcing them before one of you gets hurt."
482,"Yeah that could be it too, I admire that he takes it seriously like that, I think we just process the thought differently. 
Thanks for the insight :)"
483,"This is difficult to answer. I would just say: give him the story point blanc. That you like him, have liked him, but that there is also things holding you back. Simply be radically open and transparent.

And then, if he says he is fine with it all, chose a course of action. If he wants to try, nevertheless, you might consider taking a leap of faith and just see what happens. 

Either way, you'll have put everything onto the table. Also a big human problem is regret. And in a lot of cases leaping in and trying is much better than looking back,n 5, 10 or 50 years later having to wonder how things might have been, if you just had tried. 

It is a scary thing and not an easy decision that in the end nobody can make for you."
484,"I think you did the right thing breaking things off with D, if you hadn't she would have learned that she could get away with it and would do it again, or slightly less worse things as shed know this would be your limit. The only reason she Might not do it again, as you think, is that by breaking up you showed her she crossed the line

I think you rushed into a relationship with J too fast, you should have stayed single for awhile and take the time to recover from the heartbreak and learn how to be happy on your own. Now your emotions were never processed, and you never gave D and yourself the chance to maybe patch things up or try again.

I think you were unbelievably stupid to ask J to marry you while still in love with D, you should have known it wouldn't magically make your feelings disappear, though you might have hoped they would.

I think there's a few things for you to do right now to start getting over this mess and prevent making any more mistakes, one: get closure. Contact D and see if shes open to try again, or if that door is closed forever, itll ease your mind from the ""what ifs"" youre otherwise going to hold onto forever.
Two: sit down with yourself and be really honest, if both girls would be equally eager to be with you, and you could just pick one to marry/be with, Would you go for D? If yes, dont marry J.
Three: open up about it to J, youre in a relationship with her and there should be no secrets, she deserves to decide for herself if she wants to marry a man who is in love with two women, you both might decide its better to cancel/postpone the marriage and first work on these issues

Good luck, its a shitty situation but don't dig yourself deeper in mistakes. This is a situation where you should listen to your heart rather than your head"

486,"I was tested yesterday. It was humiliating, every aspect of it. From the nurse telling me she was so sorry, to the doctor telling me of the STD’s that I could have, to sitting with three people in a room looking at my vagina and watching swabs being taken.

Distrust isn't your future, it's your past, where you doubted yourself in favour of explanations you knew were inadequate. You have a great compass to tell you right from wrong, you just have to actually listen to it.

To be clear, I don’t think you should have magically read her mind and she could have walked over if she wanted to, but “she was on her phone so she didn’t want to join” isn’t necessarily the case, especially if she’s awkward or introverted."
505,"You should be upset.

One of my #1 pet peeves is people that agree to do something then either cancel last minute(without a real excuse) or don’t even show up or bother letting me know they won’t be there. It wastes my time. 

He could have easily texted you and said “sorry spending time with son, won’t be able to hang after all”."
506,"Cmon man... you know what happened. She wanted to fuck him, she lied to your face like basically every girl that brings up polyamory does. Pro-tip, if a girl ever says they want to open up the relationship it's 100% over as she already has a dude in mind. When she couldn't fuck him without ""cheating"" she decided to do it anyways in her meet up. She met up with a dude she was willing to lie to you about so she could fuck and then didn't fuck him? Really? You can't work shit out when your girl wants to fuck other dudes and will lie and go behind your back to do it."
507,"I’m never going to date again, I know that much. But just to mentally get over this? This shitshow is lies. Make peace with it. How is that even possible"
508,"You need to make a boundary *for yourself*. ""If she is wearing less than I'm comfortable with, I will tell her I'm uncomfortable and ask if she's willing to cover up. If she doesn't want to, I'll calmly and politely leave and tell her I'll see her another time."" That way she gets to choose what to to, and you're not telling her what to do or saying she's wrong. It's ""I'm uncomfortable, here""s what I'm going to do."" It sounds easier to do than it is. The key is to be calm and nice about it, but stick to your boundary."
509,"I am an asshole, so I feel very comfortable saying this. You’re an asshole dude"
510,"soooo my boyfriend is white, i am not. he grew up in a town that is 90% white people, literally 1% black. there is no way in hell that he would think saying anything like that would be acceptable. i do think that there are certain things that people don’t realize is wrong just because of the environment that they are in, so i don’t necessarily get mad at that. this is not one of those things. 

also, even if you could chalk this up to being uneducated / growing up in an environment where you’re not exposed to POC, the fact that you need to “explain it in a way that he’ll understand” is still problematic. Honestly, a partner that respects you should take what you have to say seriously (not even with just topics like race, but in general.) If you’re telling him “hey this thing that you said was hurtful to me” and he can’t understand or acknowledge that, that’s a problem."

513,"In my opinion it's okay that he gets invited and you don't.  the problem here though is that he's not telling you about these plans ahead of time , so that you are almost finding them out just the day or night before he leaves.

that's bad communication as well as showing you that he doesn't actually care about your opinions of the stuff he does.

An example is that even when I plan a guys trip , meaning no girls are going, I asked my girlfriend if it was okay that I would go with them on a particular date and time.  After she gave her okay, that she didn't have something else I should be doing with her at that time,  then I answered back to my friends that I could go.

And then of course like you said  , a long weekend together on a holiday is a exactly the kind of thing a couple should expect to do. the fact that he didn't even think to do something with you shows another part of him again that he doesn't consider your situation when doing stuff for himself."
514,"Whoa dude. Let her have some fun. It’s okay to not be what she is thinking about, because what is important is that you both are young, and you both deserve to go out &amp; do whatever makes you happy. I bet you can have just as much or more fun without her, right? 

On the other hand, she dumped you for another guy, then when things didn’t work out between them she came back to you &amp; you took her back? This is an odd situation so it’s inevitable to make you have trust issues, which are making you be controlling. This relationship is truly toxic and I don’t feel it will end well. In my opinion I forecast her finding a guy less up her butt, and leaving you in the dust again. Or she will use your controlling nature to mess around and then use it as an excuse."

526,"If it's only when you're out then none of the medical things like IBS make sense.

If it's only when food is present then social anxiety, not liking you, something like that doesn't make sense.

Only thing I can think of is that eating out to him doesn't register as being predominantly a social activity. Particularly if he's finishing and leaving while you're mid meal, it sounds like  he's eating like it's just a normal sustenance meal rather than a thing to do while chatting. So he's fucking off to play with his phone to wait for you to finish so that you guys can then leave. Like he's waiting for you to finish clothes shopping or something."

528,"Your reply here is exactly why you are having such a hard time.  Your level of guilt is incredibly high and you are not willing to let yourself feel better because you remember how you felt when people hurt you.  There is one huge difference though. You had a medical condition that made it *impossible* for you to do anything other than what you did.

At present, you seem to think that since you planned everything out, you did those hurtful things on purpose, just like the people from your past did hurtful things on purpose to you.  But, here's the thing, you were not capable of thinking any other way anymore than you were capable of changing the colour of your eyes.

People with other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder also think they are being completely rational when their health issue is acting up, but others know differently.

Please, please be kinder to yourself and accept that your brain's wiring got fouled up because of the tumour. You took responsibility for your actions as best you could when you spoke with the people affected. Nobody can do any more than that. Everybody needs time to heal.

530,"My boyfriend went grocery shopping when I was at work, do you think he’s cheating on me???"
531,"He helps you intellectually and has plans (social? professional?) with your boss . . . 

Does this dude work at your school or in your field? If so and he's anything higher than a tech or maybe a research assistant or a post-doc I would cut things off now. It might be one thing if you were a post-doc but you're still a student. That's a very sticky situation and could be an abuse of his power. 

Also, yes it's a red flag. Not necessarily that he poked fun, but his reaction to your reaction . Of course you're stressed and sensitive about this! Grad school is fucking hell, and when the wheels fall off your project and your PI is no help it's extremely stressful and just a nightmare of imposter syndrome. 

Personally I think you should take a break from this guy. 

And professionally . . . As someone who has been in your position with a PhD project, talk to your committee, or another PI, about your project. Obviously be diplomatic in how you phrase your absentee mentor, but your committee wants you to succeed. If you haven't tried asking for more direct management from your boss, maybe try that first. But definitely ask for help. Don't just work yourself to exhaustion trying to muddle through an issue. REACH OUT."
532,"My advice is to NOT respond nor answer his calls. You have no obligation nor responsibility towards him. Whatever was said in that text was between you two years ago and has no bearing on your life now. With that said, let go of your past and embrace what happiness you've built since then."
533,"What are you 15 lol

You have a lot to learn about how women think

First off she was upset she just let it go and when his brother  invited him he should have either declined or planned another trip

Obviously there have been other times she felt excluded other wise these incidents would not have upset her so much. Alot goes on in a year, gotta read between the lines

She also mentioned her being upset he declined wanting to move in with her

All the signs are pretty much there that he is just not as into her

And kiddo I've been married over 10 years lol and we never make plans and forget to exclude each other because we actually enjoy trips together. Does not seem to apply here

I'm not saying getting mad over one trip isn't unreasonable because there you're right it is but you kind of can just tell there is more here going on."
534,"He is really immature.  He doesn't put your feelings as a priority.  You already discussed this with him.  

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all this, this weekend was an opportunity for the two of you to have a house to yourselves alone.  How short sighted of him!

&amp;#x200B;

537,"The only overreaction you're having is worry, and I d on't blame you at all. You don't want to tell them something's a problem for you after how well they've treated you.

When the guests are gone, talk to your roommates in a friendly and calm way. Say you thought they were nice, because they were. Ask if they could please let you know a day or two next time they invite someone. It would make a difference if you hear about it ahead of time. You could have nonperishable food in your room so you wouldn't need to use the kitchen when that room is busy.

I agree you're in a bit of a spot because you can't afford to move out. If you really can't live somewhere else and this place is still worth what you pay even though they have a lot of people visit, then you're going to have to put up with it. I'm sorry."
538,Cum guzzling gutter slut
539,"Hmmm.

If he really is *only* doing it when you're out, then my best guess would be that he's using some kind of GPS-based game or app on his phone - anything from Pokémon Go to dating/hookup apps. And unfortunately one of the most likely reasons for going into the bathroom would be to hide what it is, since it's doubtful that he would have a problem playing a game in front of you, so... hopefully not. Thought it could still be online gambling. 

I don't think it's drugs. He wouldn't need that much time in the bathroom to shoot up or anything, and if he was taking so long because he's nodding out then that would be noticeable when he came out of the bathroom. 

Otherwise, it *could* definitely be that you just don't notice it at home. But the amount of time in the bathroom that IBS/IBD sufferers use would be kind of tough to miss over four years. If he's bulimic then the giveaway would be that he would be disappearing during/immediately after damn near *every* meal. 

I can't think of much else here, unless he's tagging the stall walls with permanent marker or has a fetish for masturbating in public bathrooms. I think a GPS-based app or online gambling would be the most likely option, if he *really* doesn't spend that much time in the bathroom at home."
540,Sounds like my buddy with Crohn's. Sometimes he couldn't get back home from a meal without using restroom. Literally had to shit on the side of the road. And that was during remission.
541,"This is such a good idea. If it makes you feel better write or email everyone. Then the ball is in their court. But I’m telling you your guilt will destroy you. Trust me, I know. It can make you physically sick and that’s counterproductive to your healing process. I hope you can find some peace."
542,"&gt; access to the internet has made it easier for predators to communicate with chilcren? Or access child pornography to engaage in their fantasies or meet others who share their preferences?

This is true.

However:

&gt; You dont think children carrying phones and other expensive technology makes them easier targets for thefts/kidnaps?

Considering family is responsible for over 90% of kidnappings, no.

I'm curious, are you around the age of 30-40? Because that's the age of the 24 hour news cycle that spawned the FUD movement of Stranger Danger and you seem to have bought into it hook, line, and sinker. 

The reality is that the occurrence levels haven't actually changed much, but the media reports have."
543,"Yes! Tell her! Make sure you include some proof.  She needs to know.

Wouldn't you want to know in her position?"
544,"I have no clue why everyone is mad about the age gap. Please ignore that and carry on with you relationship. Age is not relevant. I have dated many people older or younger than me and had great relationships with all of them. My long term boyfriend is twenty years older than me and he is the best boyfriend I ever had. 

I would simply ask your mom when she says these comments. “What made you say that?” When people have to explain their bad behavior they often stumble and start to realize what they are saying.

It doesn’t mean she is a narcissist (reddit loves to call everyone a narcissist) it takes a professional to diagnose narcissism and one aspect of a persons behavior is not a diagnosis. 

She may be very bitter about what happened and it’s colored her view of the world. She needs to get over it and hopefully she will. But that is not your responsibility."
545,"You will REGRET it if you have a baby this soon. No doubt. That’s 18 years of responsibility. All life will stay exactly the same except you’ll have a baby to take care of.

546,Not if she had an IUD
547,You watch too much netflix. She's got an IUD so there's not reason for wild speculation.
548,That's called empathy. Just because you empathise with someone doesnt mean you should sympathise with their shitty behaviour.
549,"Yes. Tell his wife. Tell him you told his wife and then peace out blocking him on everything.

People like this need to be outed, he’s an asshole.

A one night stand I can see not telling if you find out they’re married. But a year long relationship while he’s married? She needs to know so she can dump him too.

No woman needs a guy like that. 

And also imagine you were married and your husband was cheating like this. Would you want the woman to just walk away not telling you? Or would you rather her tell you? That is your real answer whichever it may be."
550,"You're 23 and will probably have a few more breakups in your life, and none of them will be easy, but you will always get to a place where you're ok. Literally each day will get better and easier. It's ok to cry and mope for a minute, but throw yourself into a hobby or project, join Bumble bff or Meetup to find some more friends, etc. You got this."
551,"Yeah, this is a huge red flag. It’s only been three months and she storms off like a child and refuses to speak to you because you don’t think it’s a good idea to HAVE A BABY right away? That is completely insane. I would take a good hard look at this relationship and have a conversation with her about how to handle conflict going forward, and also set realistic expectations for your relationship. Having a baby is THE most life altering decision you can make, and it should not be taken lightly by anyone."
552,"Honestly, i think it has less to do with her divorce and more just your mother being a jerk. Doesn't matter if its her divorce issues or not, she shouldn't be talking to you like that. Don't focus on convincing her to go back to therapy or try to handle her feelings with kid gloves (cause she is certainly not doing that to you). She makes a comment? ""Mom, don't talk about me or boyfriend like that."" If she doubles down, calls you sensitive, claims it was a joke, or says anything nasty - get up and leave. Or hang up the phone, whichever the situation may be. You're putting down a boundary. ""I won't tolerate being spoken to this way and if you won't stop, I'm not going to stick around to listen to it."" Be firm. I get its your mother and you're trying to help but the only way the situation will get better is if you're clear with your boundaries and have consequences."

569,"I was dating a woman for a week when I knew I wanted to have a family with her.  10 years, three stepchildren, and two together we’re going strong.  But if you have doubts, it might not be meant to happen."
570,[removed]
571,"Man, get rid of this guy. I'm probably a fair bit older than you but fuck this 'friend'. How can your friendship function while he's like this? Plus he's barely hiding his feelings for you with this behaviour..."
572,"I grew up in a city that’s majority white by a large margin. I was raised by parents who never met a black person until they were in their mid 20s away at college. (And I do mean “a” black person, as in singular.)

Not only has garbage like what your bf said never left my mouth, I’ve never heard either of my parents say anything like that either. If my parents could grow up in the 50s &amp; 60s looking at nothing but other white people and still know how to act right that means your bfs racism is a choice. He’s TWENTY. He has every tool available to him imaginable. He doesn’t need “education,” he needs consequences."
573,"I think you need more help than Reddit can give you. It troubles me that she cheated \*and\* was the one who broke up with you.  You deserve someone who will respect you, but you can't find that until you respect yourself."
574,"The only thing ""raw"" here is how he fucked those hookers lmao"
575,"I'd write an apology letter to each person, drop them in the mail, and move on with my life.

They don't owe you forgiveness, but if they forgive you, so much the better."
576,"Give yourself time. Don’t blame yourself. Feelings change and it’s usually no one’s fault - which makes it all the more sad because there’s nothing either of you could have really done to prevent it - but I promise you, it’s not your fault and what you need is just time to grieve and be sad, and process what happened. Try to distract yourself as much as you can and take people
up on their offers to hang out etc."
577,"Again I wish I would’ve added more context. I did not mention the main reason why she dumped me the first time was that I was away at college while she was still in highschool and it just wasn’t working for her. In our year and a half apart I have transferred back home to a local college (for unrelated reasons) that she also goes to. She also dumped the guy she was dating before me because of relationship issues. I truly believe the only reason we ended the first time was due to me being away, and her being so young at the time. With that being said would like to hear yours and anyone’s thoughts."
578,"This is your life, and no one can tell you if you're wasting it but you.

Do what will make YOU happy. If you want to go to college, come clean and do the best you can to explain what happened. If you don't, tell them you want to stay, and be prepared to tell then that you're willing to move out.

It sounds like you don't like math and science. For the love of God, don't take out student loans in your name to fill someone else's dream."
579,"If his is triggered by particular foods/ingredients, then maybe he's instinctively or knowingly avoiding them at home, but can't or won't when out.

Mine's triggered by some common things and while I'm mostly able to avoid them, I do occasionally get dosed when out.  My reactions tend to be a few hours after eating a trigger, though."

582,"Damn good luck. God Bless you, you deserve better."
583,"This sounds very similar to a situation I was in a few years ago. I experienced almost exactly what you described, but during college rather than high school. This girl was in such a bad situation that when I took a year off from college I let her move in with me/my family and we ended up being in a relationship for about a year. It was very toxic and I didn't know how to get out of the situation without ruining the life I'd helped her build away from her terrible home life. 

I'm not sure what specific advice I would give for now because I don't know the specifics. But, I do recognize these behavioral patterns. Her behavior is manipulative, even though I do recognize that it's probably coming from her mental illness(es) and not knowing how to engage in a health manner due to her home life. 

I'll tell you what everyone told me when I asked for advice in your position: ""she is not your responsibility."" 

I couldn't take that advice at the time, and you may struggle with it to. If you need further advice or support feel free to dm me."
584,Girl he is racist. Get out now before it’s too late and you have a kid with him
585,"Well I don't want to to tell you what to do! But to me this is all red flags and I would be pretty upset to know my SO spends so much time with another man. If you think about it, it psychologically messes you up cause you're constantly on the edge or motion of what exactly shes doing with this man or whether they would cheat or not..."
586,"You can’t really ‘’educate’’ someone who doesn’t want to be. I’m Asian but I was born in Canada in a very multicultural city. My bf happened to grow up in a town where everyone is white and it’s normal to make ‘racist’ jokes. I had to slowly explain to him, over time, that this was not okay and it was beyond offensive to me. The only reason I stayed with him was because he truly expressed that he was different from them, that he was a good person and that he too had a problem with those jokes. If he expressed indifference towards them at all, I would’ve cut him loose five years ago."
587,"He said literally ""I only"", it is a huge leap to be interpret sexual satisfaction from that.

You have to take what he said, not what you wish he said.   He could have wanted to say ""I only watched because I have a wife"".

I mean you can convince yourself of anything, but just because you stop saying something doesn't mean ""infidelity""."
588,"This is really tough. The only thing I can say is the first few experiences with sexual intimacy can be new and overwhelming. Do you trust her? Does she trust you? Do you feel that this was rushed or that you were somehow pressured into this encounter? Were you raised in a religious or cultural tradition that discourages sexual activity? Do you feel afraid of getting caught by somebody? All of these things can influence how a sexual encounter feels for you.

Here's the kicker: if you don't tell her that you're feeling uneasy about what happened between the two of you, she will likely pick up on that. Additionally, she may be feeling overwhelmed too. I would recommend communicating your unease to her but more like ""This is all so new and exciting, and I really like you a lot and I've been enjoying exploring this with you, but I'd like to take it slow together because I'm feeling overwhelmed."" (Something like that.) It's possible she's overwhelmed or uneasy as well and debriefing and opening up in this way will give her the space to communicate her own experience and needs.

If you're serious about this girl, and there's trust between the two of you, then this is something you need to face together.

If she responds poorly to you asking to slow down or if she judges you for feeling uncomfortable, then that is unacceptable and you may need to reevaluate whether or not you want to be in a sexual relationship with her. Consent for each sexual encounter needs to be enthusiastic and affirmative. Everyone moved at their own pace and that's 100% okay.

I know this comment is super rambling but I hope something in it helped."
589,"Love being the safety net...not. Ugh, life."
590,"So reading your replies, it's become apparent that you seem to think that your physical brain is separate from yourself. Like your brain is a separate entity from yourself that you can drive like a car or inhabiting like a house.

You're not necessarily wrong for holding this paradigm. It's one that's heavily pushed by society.

The reality is that the brain is not separate, it's in fact the source of your personality. 

Your mind is an emergent property of your brain. If your brain is compromised, you will be compromised. This is a scary proposition, because I think we view ourself as this discrete spirit that just happens to live in a shell. 
But this experience, has shattered that perception that says that you are not your body. Except this experience has prove that the metaphysical you is based on physical limitations.  Not to mention other diseases like Alzheimer's that also prove it.

That opens up a can of worms about how concrete is your sense of self really? How can it be so arbitrarily altered by random chance?

You will need to come to terms with the fact that you may not a be living in a house (body) but that you are the house itself. And if the house is damaged, that is you being damaged."
591,"I see your point. However, she was playing with the dog before the game started. She was also occupied by talking to other people as well who weren't participating in the game. She was on her phone when she wasn't doing those two things.

I understand that it doesn't necessarily mean she didn't want to join but it was a drinking game and I didn't call her over because drinking is something she doesn't like to do."
592,[removed]
593,"If it's no big deal to pay for it, then why is it a big deal to let her pay for it? Honestly sounds to me like you feel threatened."
594,"Well, as a thirty-year-old man with experience with women, and judging by your girlfriend's behavior and what you've said about your history with her, I would bet all the money in my checking account that she's been ignoring you the past couple of days because she's met a guy at the college she's visiting.

You had a talk with her about how it made you feel when she ignored you, and now she's doing that same hurtful thing again. You're the safety net and she's trying out another guy.

But don't worry. If that guy seems like a no-go, she'll come back to the safety net that is you.

Sorry if that hurts, and no, I'm not being mean. I'm telling you how women are."
595,I've try that before I have and I don't want it to end I'm going to put everything I can into the friendship but in the end it's going to end like that of not worse and sorry

597,GIRL He was psycho from the start
598,"Yes but he’s always been open with his phone and never hid anything , he also cleaned out other messages from his phone and deleted tbe ones with her while he was doing it , I do stuff like that all the time . And he’s not a cheater and he doesn’t flirt with other women or look at or even see or anything like that . 

This girl also supports our relationship , I’m also his first relationship so I feel like he was trying to mitigate us fighting because this is his safe space . 

He also spent 80$ on a software trying to get them back after he realized he fucked up"
599,"Talk to her in person. Tell her how you were feeling, and how you felt like she didn't care, but do your best to phrase it in a way that isn't accusatory.

She may not have known how bad it really was, even if you explained it all over text. She may have known you were going through a hard time but didn't know how to be supportive. Try not to take it personally, and always save major emotions for a meeting in person.

You must be a boomer, I’m assuming that’s why your views on how relationships are so boring and archaic.

Men and women can be away from each other momentarily without it meaning they’re fucking other people.

Sending condolences to whatever dude you tricked into thinking your shit is normal lmao"
603,"Just want to add that even though she left him for another woman that doesn't mean she's suddenly ""safe"" as a friend. She's willingly hanging out with him behind your back. Neither one of them have a problem with lying to you. It's also clear that he isn't over her. You're a replacement until she either takes him back or he comes to his senses. He's only with you because he doesn't want to be alone.

You deserve so much better than this. Josh needs a wake up call that it's not ok to jump into a relationship when you're not over an ex, it's not ok to deceive your current gf (who would have been fine with the friendship if it weren't done in the dark), and it's not ok to trample on someone else's feelings (yours) because he doesn't want to be alone and also doesn't want to give up his ex yet."

You make me laugh with this bullshit. 

It depends on the person, how they feel about it, and what they consider respectful. 

Just because you see a weekend away with a girls solo as no big thing doesn't mean that's how others view it, Hubby wouldn't be cool with it, as we are.married and he would want to also be included in a weekend trip. Just how he is. 

It's one thing if it's a trip with my sisters, or it's a hunting trip with his dad but a trip with friends, that's when it becomes a matter of a one's personal opinion.

You knew there were red flags and yet you chose to have a kid with this man anyways. That’s where you’re partially in the wrong. He obviously is too since he’s being a jerk about it. 

You’re not wrong in wanting a divorce from a partner that’s not being an actual partner. Leave him and find someone who’s better."

613,It is what I wrote above. You’re not happy and secure with yourself. That projects outwards and people see it. You need to focus on yourself and stop looking for happiness from someone else when it really comes from within. You’re basing you’re existence and your opinion of yourself on your dating experience and it’s not healthy. That’s why your not happy.
614,Go to your dad.  Apologize and explain that it was all your fault and not the dogs.  Promise to train the dog to stay out of the kitchen and the dining room if he will agree to let you have one more chance.
615,"When you’ve been nothing but loyal to someone for a long time, it makes everything else very difficult at first when you’re not with that person any more. You get constantly reminded of things you used to do together, all the laughs and fun memories you had when you felt happy. It’s going to take some time getting back into the bedroom with someone else. You have to make sure you are happy with yourself and your family. Once you’re comfortable with being without a SO, then it’ll start to feel more right to say yes to someone who hits on you or asks you out. As for toys, I’d start small and work your way up. I suggest just a simple vibrating 6in dildo for now, until you’re familiar with toys and how they feel. Then work your way up to bigger, sturdier, flexible sizes. I hope this helps! Best of luck to you on your new journey."
