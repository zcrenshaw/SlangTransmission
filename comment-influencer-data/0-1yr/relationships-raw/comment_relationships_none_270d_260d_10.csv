0,"The girl is 23. She's an adult, 4 hours and she couldn't figure out to call the friend she was going to stay with to ask and figure how to get over there? "
1,"When I found out my then-fiance was cheating on me, I threw up. I still have a very visceral reaction when I think about that time, now almost 9 years later. I am in a wonderful relationship now and have not a shred of positive emotion towards my ex. But the feelings were still very intense and still reverberate sometimes "
2,"Why don't you let her know you don't have the funds or vacation time to come visit and ask if you can be introduced and have a virtual hang out via skype or facetime or something?

Frankly, it's shitty etiquette of her to have sent you a save the date and now be making your invitation conditional. My eyebrow is raised in the direction of the fiance who imposed this after-the-fact benchmark."
3,"I would contact the family first personally. Your mother isn’t able to be honest or tell the truth, and what she did was a huge breach of trust. I would just apologize for your mother’s behavior and tell them that her contacting them was not you. That way you can still have that pathway open for you in case future contact with your child is wanted. "

5,"&gt;he had the nerve to JOIN ME at the place I was staying after he found out about it from others. When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me. 

Holy shit, that is like a sociopathic level of horribleness. I’m so, so sorry, I can’t even imagine how hurtful and even humiliating that must have felt to hear him say. 

It really, really freaks me out to think that he likely really enjoyed being able to laugh at you and say no, he doesn’t want to be with you, just wanted to have fun.

Ugh, scum bag. "
6,"&gt;FIL called us to say that BIL was invited to spend christmas with the family because his wife was pregnant. He only wanted to make sure that we knew this because he didn't want us showing up to ""ruin everyone's good time"".

Bull shit. He called to rub it in that BIL is the golden child and your husband is the scapegoat. Really, the only thing to do is to support your husband however he decides to deal with his family. If he wants to ghost the famdamily, so be it. Your husband might benefit from some personal counselling as he processes getting shut out by his family. You and your husband know perfectly well that BIL was not joking. He has an unhealthy obsession with the women your husband has been involved with. "
7,"That’s what I’m wondering about. Apparently she sat at the airport for 1.5 hours waiting for someone, anyone before calling my gf and asking her to come get her. Gf then calls me but I wasn’t near my phone so she drove 1.5 hours to get to the airport herself. 

I have no idea why her sister couldn’t get a cab, an Uber/lyft, the airport train, a bus, or any number of the options available to bring people from the airport into the city. It’s all very clearly marked. "
8,"So is she just ""dramatic"" or is she actually unbalanced? Because I feel like you're soft-pedaling some stuff here."
9,"They are embarrassed because they, themselves forgot her.  It is easier for them to blame you instead of apologizing.  This is a taste of your future if you continue this relationship.


Added:  wow!  Thank you for the silver and bunches of upvotes!  I just got my 15 minutes of fame and it feels sweet!"
10,"If I showed up at my girlfriend's place unannounced during times that people usually sleep and she didn't answer her phone, I'd assume she was asleep.  You know, like a normal person."
11,Let her be angry. Don't respond. She is throwing a tantrum because she didn't get her way. She's being a child.
12,Prince spent a lifetime seducing woman while wearing a full face of makeup. You do you.
13,"Aside from this issue, would you like to be your sister's bridesmaid?

If yes, ""It seems we disagree a lot, how about you pick my dress.""

If no, ""I know I said yes but I'd like to back out, I want you to have a happy and fun wedding planning and wedding and we seem to be arguing a lot. Staying a bridesmaid seems unhealthy for our sibling relationship.""

I also bet this has to do with your bustiness, you might want to check out /r/bigboobproblems for suggestions on dress styles."
14,Congrats on your engagement and I'm glad it all worked out!
15,He can ask you to throw them out (still an overreaction worthy of posting about on reddit) but he cannot throw them out himself.  
16,"She's not in fine mental health.  People in fine mental health do no behave like this.  If anything, it sounds like she has always had some kind of mental health struggles, but because you were raised in this environment, it feels like of normal.  

I repeat...people who really are mentally balanced DO NOT act this way.  She either really believes he cheated (having a psychotic break), or knows he's not cheating but has decided to blow things up for some reason (which still suggests a mental health crisis).  This level of drama is almost impossible without some kind of mental health issue underlying it.  "
17,"You will probably want to ask in /r/legaladvice and/or actually talk to a financial advisor or lawyer, for advice not for a lawsuit.  Because a brief googling of Parent PLUS says that ""they cannot be transferred to the kids"", that's the whole point of it.

And ultimately, your father is asking you to take on the debt without giving you any benefits.  See, what happens is if your parents have debts, the debts eventually go against ""the estate"", and you won't inherit the house or whatever property they have until the debts are paid.

So, as it is right now, he's trying to get you to accept debt, but not offering to transfer the house in your names too.

From what you've posted, it sounds like he's trying to deal with the upcoming financial losses from the divorce.  So if this is something that his divorce lawyer is advising, then you hire your own lawyers or financial advisers for advice in the matter, and proceed based on that.

Talk to a professional, rather than Reddit.  It's a serious matter."
18,"Wow.

Ok, so first of all, you should reach out to the couple that adopted your child and tell them that you just found out your mother reached out and was asking them for money.  Tell them you hope they didn't send her anything because this was done entirely without your knowledge, under false pretenses, and that they should never feel they have to give you OR your family any money, ever.

Second, have it out with your mom.  She has some fucking nerve trying to capitalize on your pregnancy after how she treated you.  And all of her apologies are called completely into question now that you know she did this.  "
19,No. don't stay with someone abusive. He will get worse. You've now started the cycle of abuse where he hurts you and then lovebombs you. Get out before it is too late.
20,"Her daughter took her by surprise and apparently poked a sore spot when she asked about why they had broken up. Your wife may very well have been surprised by the strength of her own reaction. How awkward for her to be asked that by a child, too, and perhaps not know how to answer without either having to lie or going into more adult details than you'd want to share with a 12 year old.

Please don't make this into something about your relationship - bring your wife some flowers and try to show that you understand emotions can be a little messy at times and that's OK. 

Bonus: you'll be showing your wife why the man she married is a better man than the asshole who cheated, too."
21,"If he can work out 2 hours each day, he can do some work around the house and not claim ""knee issues"" as an excuse. 

If you're not enjoying doing these things, which you're clearly not, sit down and have a chat with him (about everything that's bothering you). You're his partner, his equal, not his maid. He's a grown ass adult and can make his own protein shake lol. 

Edit: I JUST REALIZED HE'S THIRTY. WTF. 

Edit 2: He completely berates you when you argue! Do you want to live a life of being verbally abused by your husband? Because this is how you do it. He won't even let you try to express yourself without turning it around and attacking you. Instead of avoiding confrontation (that SHOULD be able to occur in a healthy relationship), you just need to change this situation. He completely disrespects you. Don't let him destroy you emotionally. "
22,"You should have trouble getting past this. She's been having an emotional affair with the guy, hiding things from you and lying about stuff for months. This is not what a quality life partner does. Think about this very carefully before you decide to marry or have kids, this is a major red flag so early in the relationship."
23,"The lack of communication is NOT your fault, and your girlfriend's family behavior is not warranted what so ever.

&gt;I even asked my gf about her sister before she came and if I still needed to do anything and gf said idk what her plans are and we should just play it by ear.
&gt;

Did your girlfriend just expect you to know what time/location to pick up her sister? You did not hear anything from the group text, your girlfriend told you to ""play it by ear"", and the sister did not try to contact you until she was actually at the airport waiting. This is in no way shape or form your fault. You were nice enough to offer, but it wasn't really your responsibility to coordinate the pick up. That directly falls on the sister."
24,"Protect you and the kids. Went through this almost exact same thing. Stayed with him. He did it again, and again and again. Finally divorced him and I’ve never been happier. "
25,"This woman is incredibly unprofessional and your husband is an idiot for engaging with a conversation, *especially one like that* with her and not shutting it down instantly. This is not a problem he can just ignore and it will go away. This could fuck his life professionally if he isn't careful because he is giving this girl just enough rope to hang him by not shutting down these obviously leading questions.

He needs to tell her, in text, to stop messaging him, stop talking to him unless it is strictly work related. This is a hard boundary that you need him to set for your marriage. If she persists despite this, he needs to escalate this on a professional level, i.e. contacting her manager/HR/etc."
26,And dating a 45 year old. Her decision making skills are obviously poor.
27,"It doesn't really matter why he said that stuff but it was horribly nasty. You deserve someone who brags about you, not shits on you. "
28,"You didn’t do anything wrong. Your friend chose to believe the realtor they’ve known for a short time over you. Personally I don’t think it’s worthy your time to try and reach out to your friend, unless you feel as if your friend is actually embarrassed that she recommended a shitty agent."
29,"""A series of unusual events"" is - you slept through a gate buzz and some texts?  And the obvious conclusion to jump to is that you're cheating?

That's nowhere near reasonable."
30,"Well, on one hand it is totally inappropriate for him to do that. It's pretty mean behaviour.

*However*, in your original post you *did* miss out what the card from your coworker actually said, so for the benefits of other people coming to the comment section after reading your OP...

&gt;""Though you only make up a small part of my life your presence fulfills my eternity. Happy Holidays Ladybug.”

That message is all kinds of wrong. Now I can understand why your fiancé got as upset as he did, because that message is completely and totally inappropriate in a message from one person to another in a platonic friendship. And you should really be having words with Jason about your friendship, or at least stop being naive/wilfully ignorant about his intent because it certainly doesn't sound innocent. Having said that, I don't condone your partner chucking everything out, because it was still your property. 

Édit: Thank you to whoever gave me silver. That is amazing! "
31,"Hey man, this isn't worth it. People don't flake like this if they care about fostering a friendship. Invest in people who invest in you. "
32,"You aren't in the middle.  This is your fight, your boundaries to set.  You are responsible for handling your parents, not your fiance.

Adult up and handle your mother. "
33,[deleted]
34,"Screenshot what he is sending you, send it to your sister and politely say “If this is how [husband] wants to speak to me simply for asking you guys to clean up after yourselves, he won’t be welcome again.”

Don’t reply to him. 

Seriously - this is *your house*. What you asked for is super reasonable, and he has no right to speak to you like that. "
35,"OP you're severely desensitised to your mother's actions by her past behaviour. From your comment to another poster it's obvious that she's had episodes in a similar vein before this one (ranging in severity), but you're not divulging and you don't fully realise the severity of her actions.

Honestly, short of professional medical help, you can't really do anything. It's obvious that she's having some form of mental breakdown when she won't even speak to any family member (not just your dad who is the accused, but also you). You suggest to your father that you and he both go to a medical professional and get advice, then get your mother assessed."
36,"When I read the title my first thought was no. After reading your post, I say as long as you feel comfortable doing so, and it won’t lead to resentment of any kind, to 100% do it. "
37,"Time to start telling everyone who thinks your still in a relationship something like this: ""Oh him? He is a creep.  3 months after I broke up with him he tried to crash my vacation.""

Don't let him prey on you due to the ignorance of others."
38,"Depends on how you feel...        
 
Something like ""Hey, my reaction to your apology was harsh. Clearly I still have resentment and I am still working through that. It is more about me and less about you. You are my brother, I love you, and I am glad you apologized, but I still have problems with it. So, I hope we can let the subject go for now and maybe when I am ready, we can discuss again. """
39,"I’m not even going to seriously fault him for initially asking some questions and not being 100% comfortable with it all outright. Not even because of just the fruit basket/card, moreso the sunflowers in addition to it. Doubting Jason’s motivations a bit. Until you told him something along the lines of him doing this for the other women you work with too and how obvious your sunflower love is at work. 

But it’s a bit telling that even though you don’t explicitly say it was any more than that, the interaction was enough you were not even planning on leaving the fruit basket at home and put the flowers out back on the patio. Those aren’t the actions of someone whose partner was just a bit less enthused than you thought they may be. 

Then you didn’t even call him when you noticed the fruit basket was gone. When you noticed the sunflowers, card, and fruit were tossed. Not because you didn’t want to or otherwise couldn’t, but because he was going to get mad. Think about that for a minute. He destroys a gift that was given to you that you enjoyed that you offered to share with your fiancé. Where even if he still doubted Jason’s motives, it was obvious you weren’t hiding anything at all or doing anything sketchy yourself. Yet despite being wronged by this and fully justified in being upset you stop yourself because of your fiance’s reaction to you being justifiably upset. There is no way this is the first time he’s done something like this judging by your reactions. "
40,"I cant get past the bf older than her dad. Yuck. That guy is a creep and she's a dummy. 

That said, no, it's a group gift and that is that. Why should you have to scramble to find something else to give this girl? It is in no way your responsibility to make sure this daughter appears responsible in her mom's eyes (the bf and lack of job already prove she isn't. One gift wont change that.) I do agree with the other poster for giving her credit for picking out the gift. How to deal with her anger? Maybe say you're sorry you cant do more and end the discussion. She's 18, her brain isn't fully formed yet, she will get over it in time... or she won't, but you cant change it. If shes that type of person she would just find something else to mad at you for.

Finally, try to make sure she's provided with birth control. This BF is bad news, the last thing they need is a pregnancy. "
41,"Reach out to the family personally, apologize for your mother's manipulation, offer to repay anything they sent to her (if you are able), request that they dismiss/ignore any further requests from your mother, and then go no contact with your mother.    
   
This individual sounds toxic. Any involvement you have with her will be opening yourself up for stuff like this.  "
42,"I think her sacrificing her job for the sake of yours is a worthwhile trade off if you help her with ~~your~~ her debt. In fact, a lot of couples that DO move for a job end up with one partner feeling bitter or resentful because they had to sacrifice for the other. In this case, you'd both be making some kind of sacrifice which may actually bode well for the relationship.

I think it's thoughtful to do IF you can afford it and it's something she'd want. It might be a tough pill for her to swallow but I'd explain it to her like this: ""I hope you consider this as me trying to be fair. I recognize you'd be moving for my career and taking a hit to your own. I'd feel better about this move knowing I could do this for you. ""  "
43,"People die of alcohol poisoning. You could have died on the side of that street and he would have been the last person seen with you.

You thought you were friends. Now you know he values a good night out more than your safety. Unless this is something that you have done multiple times this year and he already talked about this with you sober, I would say you found out something pretty scary about Mark."
44,"I'd tell him that you overheard him on his birthday. He can't deny it. 

Then I'd leave this douchebag and not look back. You deserve better.  "
45,"""It is exactly what I wanted. I hope when you get married you can be as lucky as I am and have a fiance who knows you well enough to get you exactly what you want.""

She is less likely to be critical if she goes straight into talking about what she wants?"
46,"if you ask and it isn’t your kid, it will be embarrassing but you won’t really lose anything. if that is your kid, uh, holy shit."
47,Same. I love my current partner and have no feelings for my ex but the feelings of betrayal and the psychological damage he caused still lingers. If I have to see him or if someone brings him up I still react because it was a very negative time in my life with bad memories. Its more remembering the person I was/what he put me through that causes distress.
48,"Let's not talk about your BF. He's obvious: a garden-variety selfish user. 


Let's talk about you for a minute.


What are your boundaries? Have you ever thought about them? Could you articulate them? 


How do you enforce boundaries? What strategies do you have for ensuring others don't violate them? How confident are you in your ability to be assertive about enforcing them?


What are your needs? What do you need from a romantic partner? Can you articulate your needs? Do you think your needs are valid? 


I think you really ought to spend some time learning about yourself. I think you should understand why you tolerate someone using you like this; why you don't recognize it as outrageous and toxic; why you invalidated and dismissed yourself in favor of another person.


What's going on with you? How did you get to this place?"
49,"I'm stuck at the damn Uber. It's not hard. My 59 year old mother who can't use a flash drive can figure out Uber.

Like what the hell. 

You didn't do anything wrong here. It was on the sister to make damn sure you were willing and able to pick her up and that she gave you all the necessary details. 

This is literally all on the sister. "
50,"You did NOTHING wrong.

If GF's sister wanted to be picked up, you needed the information to do so.  Moreover, there's absolutely no reason that the sister should have waited 4 hours.  Your GF could have picked her up.  Or her sister could have taken an Uber or taxi.

My warning:  Your GF and her family are showing you how they treat you.  They tell you what to do (GF volunteered you), they keep you in the dark (didn't give you the information you needed), and blame you when things go wrong.  Is that really how you want to spend your life?"
51,"To take the generous view: she might genuinely not realize how much she's asking of you, especially if you two haven't met in person recently. For her a trip somewhere over a weekend might be an easy thing to organize, and it's a human trait to think of things mostly from one's own perspective.

Tell her that you tried but unfortunately realized that you really can't afford it/can't get the time off, and suggest skyping as an alternative (that's a great idea if you ask me!). 

Then take it from there, based on her reaction to your skype suggestion. "
52,"&gt; Bull shit. He called to rub it in that BIL is the golden child and your husband is the scapegoat. 

Definitely! 

""You *would* have been invited to join in our nice family Christmas with us, except you ruined everything by complaining about being invited to your brother's orgy! This is what you get for making a fuss!"""
53,"“I do know my place.  It’s the one with my shower, which is full of your jizz”

"
54,Sometimes people really are actual adults....
55,"One of the secondary problems around sexual harassment is that the victim doesn't feel like they are in control of the situation. Undermining your girlfriend's agency by contacting this creep against her wishes will likely make her feel worse, not better. Your girlfriend was the one who was wronged here. Your best move is to give the power back to her, and allow her to take the lead on what actions to pursue. "
56,"I also think that since she's the one who got creeped on, it should ultimately be her decision how she wants to handle it. Her fear is legitimate. I've had dudes I was with start getting aggressive when I've been catcalled and wanted to just keep walking and it made me wildly uncomfortable and even afraid every time. I think that, while the intention is noble, it's a little disrespectful to escalate something on someone else's behalf when they explicitly state they don't want that."
57,"I already told her no, and I told my husband what's happened. But now that she is angry at me I dont know how to talk to her or respond to her anger. "
58,Awww this is the kinda stuff I’m here for! I’m so glad the situation was resolved healthily and congrats on the engagement! 🤗☺️
59,"Something that stuck out to me:

Keep in mind, the timing of this might not be coincidental. You faded her out last January after her child's birthday party where she requested expensive gifts which shows she might know you have the means to buy them.

When does she start to ramp up her efforts to contact you? Days before Christmas and possibly only a few weeks before her child's birthday party. She might be hoping to re-connect with you before these major milestones so she can guilt you into buying nice presents for her kids.

Maybe this is just me being paranoid for you, but she seems a bit manipulative. Both in the financial sense (requesting expensive gifts after just reconnecting a year prior) and in the relationship sense (asking others about you, having her child cold-call you because she knows you're too nice to be rude to a child.) 

Honestly, i'd keep your distance. If what i'm thinking is true, she'll ramp it down after Xmas and her kid's birthday because you won't be able to provide presents then. "
60,"You can prevent her identity theft and financial abuse from ruining your adult life by reporting her to the police, it is an actual serious crime and gets harder to fix with time."
61,"It is a seriously creepy/stalker move. Combine that with him entering her her place after the break up and it’s clear he has zero respect for her. It’s gross. 

Joke’s on him though. It is SUPER pathetic to show up on her holiday like that. Really sad and desperate. "
62,Ripping up the card is a really visceral reaction.  I'm not sure I would be comfortable that he has so little faith in you and your relationship (you're getting married!) that he gets *that* angry about it.  
63,Your instincts are correct.
64,"""I am sorry you feel that way. I hope you join us tonight to give the gift. I'm sure your sister will love it! You have great taste.""

Don't be surprised if she already told her sister some lie about where the gift came from."
65,"Seems like he took you under his wing when you were at a vulnerable point in your life, took advantage of your naivety and groomed you for a kink/fetish lifestyle that he wanted.  It also seems like he never expected you to actually enjoy it.  Now that you have more self-confidence, more self-esteem, are taking more control of your life, he's feeling jealous and like you don't need him anymore.  He wanted you to be his little sex toy to show off, but that's not you anymore.  He wanted you to fit a certain role and you've outgrown that and become your own person, which is probably something that he didn't expect.  This relationship has probably run it's course and it might be time for you to move on."
66,"Sounds like you are both best off separating yourselves from his family.  WTF kind of mom enables sex jokes to her daughter in law from her other son?

I am NC with my sister and VLC with my Dad over their “jokes” and other issues that could be resolved with a simple apology.

I don’t know what the right answer is for your husband, if he wants to do therapy, by all means.

Me, there’s no level of therapy that will give me a decent family, so I’ve long detached myself and moved on."
67,"Seconded. Let them know that you didn't know or approve of her doing this, that any further communication between you will be from (your email and/or phone number) and that you are doing just fine. Since the emails are from August, you might want to find out if they already bought into her story and gave her money. "
68,"Tough situation, but honestly I feel like it is best to rip off the bandaid quickly so you can get on with your life."
69,You did ask. You asked your girlfriend if you needed to do anything and she shrugged it off. 
70,"First off. They are actively trying to get pregnant. Yikes, I know. I've had lots of conversations with her, so has her dad, and her mom (her mom and I get along fairly well, mostly just communicate about the kids), and her moms boyfriend. So yeah, she doesnt have the best head screwed on her shoulders. 

Her boyfriend is a creep, and also has a 21 year old daughter. So yeah his daughter is older then his girlfriend. He also told her he was 40 and then surprise he lied and is 45. So yeah just.....not good. 

But thank you for your advice. When I told her no, and told her it was from me and her that her and I made a collective effort. I also offered to have her reimburse me for the coat, and she said no. I'm trying to be fair without being mean. 
"
71,"""It was very short and sweet. He wrote his own note that said, “Though you only make up a very small part of my life, your presence fulfills my eternity. Happy Holidays Ladybug (my nickname).”""

Seriously? You left this out of your post. This completely changes the dynamic. Your fiance over reacted, but the relationship this coworker has with you is completely inappropriate.

That is not something a married man says to his female friend. I guarentee you that if his wife saw this hand written love note and heartfelt gift, he'd be in a world of trouble.

The fact that you see nothing wrong with this gift, or the note it came with, is a serious red flag. I personally would have serious second thoughts about an engagement to someone who thought this was appropriate ""friend"" behavior.

Edit: I see you stealth edited your post to include the wording on the card. This is good, as it offers a more complete picture. Generally, though, it's best to seperate edits out. Exactly like this.

Edit 2: Sweet! This is the first reddit silver I've ever gotten! Thank you anonymous internet users for your generosity!!"
72,First and most pertinent question - is this girl your *only* friend? 
73,"He hasn’t just been “contacting them for pricing.” Don’t stick your head in the sand, OP.  Seriously. "
74,"/r/raisedbynarcissists 

You are not the only one. 

The next few years are going to be very difficult for you, since your mother sees you as an extension of herself, as you start to differentiate your identity she will blame you. She will accuse schools and friends and lovers of 'brainwashing' and changing you because you're developing opinions of your own. 

Your best bet is to focus on school and financial independence from her. Start researching student loans now and when you go to college, don't go back."
75,That fart saved her from a lifetime of dealing with this asshole.
76,He went to her place unannounced *because* he thinks she's cheating.
77,"The sister is apparently very sheltered and easily lost according to the rest of the family although the few times I’ve met her she seemed 100% normal. 

It is puzzling to me that the sis would just sit at an airport for 1.5 hours by herself with no thought as to contact someone. I’m not even sure how accurate parts of the story is because I’m obviously hearing it from my angry gf and her angrier mom, who are likely to embellish things to make my actions seem more egregious..."
78,"I'm very glad you got out of that, clearly June is not a safe person to be around. Don't worry about the people who judge you over his version of events, if they're not willing to listen to what you have to say about it they're not true friends anyway.

What your mom said breaks my heart, I hope she eventually finds the strength to leave as well."
79,"At first I was going to suggest he may be depressed considering the low libido and lack of interest in hobbies, but that took a hard turn into controlling behavior. Unless you're blowing copious amounts of money regularly or you two are struggling, he should not be monitoring your spending habits. His attitude toward your food intake is rude and manipulative. When did this behavior change occur, was it a slow shift or did it happen suddenly after you got married? I'm not going to call it abusive without a little more information, but it's certainly not loving and supportive.

Edit: while much of his behavior is still not okay, I just saw elsewhere that you have about $250,000 of debt. That changes my view somewhat. $800 of ""play money"" a month is a lot when you're in that kind of debt and you say he's the one handling all your finances to the point where you don't even know how to do your own taxes. It may be that turning 30 woke him up to the fact that you two need to be aggressively digging yourself out of debt and he's feeling a little resentful that you still want to spend like you're in your 20s, which is coloring the rest of your relationship with him feeling ""parental."" Like I say, the way he's handling it is still not ok, but I think you should add the fact that you have that much debt to the original post because I do think it changes things."

82,"Please, please leave. Strangling a domestic partner is the biggest indicator that he will eventually kill you. He was literally moments away from murdering you if he had held on too long or squeezed too hard. Statistics show that you are 7 times more likely to be killed by your partner than the average domestic abuse victim (i.e ""just"" hitting etc) since he has already put his hands around your throat. 

He is escalating his behaviour, you need to leave before he does something else. I'm genuinely worried for you.. .don't let him take your emotional or physical safety away any longer. 

I dont know where you live but if you are in the USA, you can call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for help and advice. If you live elsewhere, feel free to PM me and I'll get you some numbers and resources that may help. 

You deserve better than what he is offering. You can find someone who will treat you with the love and respect you deserve as a human being.

EDIT: This comment has got a bit of attention. OP, if you see this, please also take notice of some of the other comments in the thread about staying safe if you choose to leave him (and we all really hope you do). He may try to hurt you if you tell him you are leaving so do it safely.. make your plans in secret, wait for him to go to work or somewhere else and pack your important documents (birth certificate, passport etc) and get out and dont come back. Go to a friends or a family members or a womans shelter. 

If you feel like you have to 'tell' him your leaving, write it in a note or txt him. Do not do it in person. Then block him on everything you have. He will work his abusive butt off to manipulate you so you will come back to him and then he will escalate the violence so dont give him a voice. "
83,"Unpopular opinion here, but your father took those loans out, not you. Further to that, he took them out and did not at any time communicate to you that they would be your responsibility. He has retirement in mind and wants to pass the debt off to you as a means to do so. I don’t think that’s fair at all. "
84,Lock in the new job before quiting. Also this is why I NEVER tell my current employer where I am going until after my probation is up at my next job. I was torpedoed by a boss that is very much like yours 2 weeks into my new job and was fired because of what they said.
85,"EDITED AT BOTTOM

Honestly, this would be break up territory for me.

Guys and girls can be friends. And everyone in your office was exchanging gifts. There’s nothing suspicious about this.

He’s gonna get jealous over a fruit basket? A fruit basket doesn’t exactly scream “I’m in love with you. Please leave your fiancé for me.” If Jason had gotten you an expensive piece of jewelry, yeah, it’d be a little suspicious. But some pears, a generic Christmas card, and your favorite flowers, which isn’t a secret because it sounds like everyone knows you are obsessed with sunflowers, is a good gift for a coworker that you are friendly with. 

The fact that he tore the card up and even went so far as to hide the evidence in the outside bin means he knows what he did was wrong, but he didn’t care enough about your feelings. It’s also saying that he doesn’t trust you at all.

Eventually, this could lead to abusive behavior where you preemptively start cutting ties with guy friends because you know it will cause an argument in the future. Your fiancé is attempting to isolate you, at least from other men.

ETA: I was the first person to comment on this post and did not see the edit until I got replies asking if I saw it. 

OP, you really left out an integral part of the story here. I would be extremely unhappy if my boyfriend got a card from a female coworker (who I never really heard about) that basically said that he fulfilled her life.

I still maintain that it was a complete overreaction that he threw everything out and destroyed it. It should have been an adult conversation regarding boundaries and how you should shut down advances from other people and then from there, it would have been up to you on whether you threw the gift away or not.

But, personally, I never would have brought that card home and, if I did, I definitely wouldn’t show it to my boyfriend."
86,"This post sure ended up very different than I was expecting. The friends shit talking your wife are actually right and you agree with everything they say? Not sure what to tell you about that one, except that it's going to take some major work to change the dynamic of a 6 year marriage, and especially if its one where your partner doesn't see a problem (and why would she, when it sounds like even you think you're a perfect doormat for her to wipe her feet on). 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to be cliche and jump on the ""leave"" train that this sub is famous for, but unless you discover a way to change her whole personality, this is who is she is, and so the only thing you can work on is yourself. I highly doubt she's going to like you taking your power back, so even if you don't leave her, she will probably leave you and demonize you along the way. It really sucks you had a kid with her, but definitely (and very quietly) look into all your rights regarding custody and how to as smoothly as possible extricate yourself from this relationship if it comes to it. I'm sorry, OP, this is a tough spot you're in. "
87,"\&gt;  I pulled up on my phone recent cases of women assaulted in the area and he said “blah blah blah” and “when it’s your time it’s your time”. 

It sounds like he literally doesn't care if you get raped or murdered.  You weren't overreacting.  This guy is terrible."
88,"This sucks, and I get why you want to do something, but stop doing anything. 
Disengage, block texts, and leave it for HR to handle now. Continue to show the messages to them.  This behavior is unprofessional and bad.  He never led her on, but it sounds like she got attached. He maybe needs to learn to be a little less friendly at work, or just how to screen better for psychos. "
89,"You asked her if you did the same, would she consider it cheating and she said yes. It is called emotional cheating, in fact. Can you believe her when she says she wont do it again or jump into bed with the guy? Can you trust her not to?"
90,"&gt; I decided to just save the fruit to enjoy at work so my fiancé wouldn’t get even more upset and I put the vase of sunflowers on our back patio.

&gt; I was about to call my fiancé to ask where it was but knew he was just gonna get mad.

I'm just pointing these out as two instances where you modified your behavior out of fear/worry of your fiance's anger. Now, it's normal sometimes to avoid confrontations and fights, because they're unpleasant. But it gets into red flag territory when normal things, like eating fruit in your own home, become things you avoid.

I could understand your fiance's jealousy if Jason had gotten you say, a dozen red roses and some chocolate. But what you got could've come from ANYONE. It's an appropriate gift for a boss to give someone as a job well done; it'd be an appropriate gift for a first grade teacher. If a 12-year-old could give it to a school principal, it's not romantic. Fruit and sunflowers are benign.

And his passive aggression is a big red flag. Secretly destroying your things isn't an okay way to work out unpleasant emotions.

ETA: people are pointing out the card and such; it wasn't there when I posted and I didn't come back to the post until now. Obviously that's gross. He still doesn't get to throw away the present; an appropriate response is to say, ""I don't know if you realize this, but the note he wrote you is rather inappropriate. We need to set boundaries with this coworker to protect our relationship from his interference."" Destroying the gift doesn't improve the relationship or fix the problem, or set boundaries. In general when someone is a possibly inappropriate interloper on your relationship, it's better to view it as an us vs. this outside threat, not a me vs. you or me vs. a vase of flowers and some fruit. Also, the fact that the card was inappropriate doesn't make her fiance in the right. He cursed at her and threatened to spit in her face. That's not an okay reaction."
91,"Lol, wtf. She’s 23 years old. If the message was that OP was to pick her up, she should have been texting you the day before with details and confirmation. Whole family looks like a bunch of fuckups that can’t take responsibility for their own inaction from this snippet "
92,"A guy left me for another woman in the most horrible and degrading fashion that I was upset for years afterwards just thinking about it. If I was at all unprepared for the memory I would have burst out crying too. Even while wanting to rip his stupid face off.

The fact that 12 yr old daughter didnt know makes me think she could be 100% honest, and buried that pain with ""I dont want to talk about it"" before now.  Kids are curious though so eventually daughter thought she could ask. 

Your wife needs someone to talk to who wont be judgemental about this like a therapist. Please dont hold her having feelings against her. Try to problem solve with her instead of assume the worst about her actions here. Good luck"
93,"Woman here... 

?????

No. Don’t do that. It’s none of your girlfriends business and it’s inappropriate of her to even ask you that. Sounds like she got your ex’s version of the relationship and totally just went with it. Fuck that. "
94,"This. I imagine she wasn’t expecting to be ambushed by a probing question about her ex during a relaxing family dinner (not saying this was the daughter’s intent, but I imagine that’s how it felt). Sometimes the humiliation of a particularly nasty breakup long outlasts any lingering romantic feelings for the ex in question. If her chosen coping mechanism at the time was “just don’t think about it,” being asked a direct question about the breakup probably brought a lot of pain to the surface very quickly. "
95,"Sounds like he was caught off guard, and surprised. I’m sure he’s cringing that he said “right back atcha”. But look at the bright side: at least he didn’t do finger guns too. 

Maybe he’s just not ready to say it yet. Maybe he thought he’d say it first. Maybe he does feel it but was just surprised and blurted out a response. 

Don’t go the route of “well, I’m sure as shit not saying it again!” Sit down and talk to him, as uncomfortable as it may be. Understand where you’re each at, and be ready to respect his feelings if he’s not there yet. But who knows, maybe you’ll be pleasantly surprised and he just panicked in that moment. "
96,"This post has a LOT about how awesome Christian is, but very little on what your gf is like. You know better than us - is she awesome too and you just didn't mention it?

There's a few hunches I'd have about what the issue is (I don't buy that she is that strongly anti-religion and you didn't realise til now):
1. Did she have an abortion? Or someone close to her? It would be understandable if the conversation felt a lot more personal and judgemental then (the timing of this makes this my favourite theory)
2. I know you said he never said to her, but the vibe of 'you're a gold-digger' probably bled through "
97,"It sounds like your parents-in-law place a lot of weight on genetics, so the grand children are more important because they are genetically related to them, something like that? I think it's wrong, but I've heard such sentiments before.

But I think talking with your husband is the right call here. He's the one who should be saying ""Hey, my wife is my family, she should be included"". The same goes for his brothers. 

Actually if they all would be on board this might resolve itself fairly easily. All it would take is for the husbands to insist their wifes are part of the family, and be consistent about it for a while. "
98,"&gt;he looks better in person and that his voice matched his looks

Unprofessional as fuck.   Even if he doesn't cheat,  going along passively with those advances will bite his ass later down the line if she's fired."
99,"You two are both oversharing details. Your mom doesn't need you to tell her every detail about your work schedules, your hobbies, etc. She asked when you guys would be coming. You both should have answered by 2pm. There is no need to explain any details of your day before going over, you're simply not available. "
100,"So prank scaring your sibling at 13 is a highly normal and expectable thing to do. Everyone does that. To have that sibling get hurt in that process isn't always expectable, and he felt bad from the moment it happened. He has felt intense guilt *for years* over your injury and your reaction to his attempt to apologize. I think you should sit down with a therapist and get some real perspective and figure out how to talk to your brother, probably including some apology for telling him to fuck off. "
101,"To begin with, the first rule of traveling is making sure you know your itinerary beforehand. Why didn't the sister contact you before she even stepped on the plane to remind you that she was coming and confirm whether or not any last minute changes were taking place? She's 23 years old, not 23 months old. Tbh your gf and mom sound like terrible people and I'd start running imo. Staying with her sounds like a recipe for getting berated over things she didn't follow up on currently and that's an exhausting way to live."
102,I bet they picked the date then planned the wedding and realized shit is expensive and have come up with this as a justification for dumping people off the invite list.  
103,"So this is a case where everyone has held her hand for her entire life, enabled her learned helplessness, and now are blaming you for not reading their minds and following the script?"
104,"Why do you keep giving her money and/or paying for her shit? Like obviously, yes, break up with her - there's no real way to make it painless but I would at least be honest - but you need to work on standing up for yourself before your next relationship and not enabling poor decisions. "
105,"This sounds like classic projection. People who don’t have a handle on their inner lives do this constantly. “I’m miserable, so my SO must be causing it!” Except that no, they just don’t want to admit they are causing their own misery through shitty behavior. It’s time for you guys to go to therapy, and for you to read this post at the first session."
106,"Sounds like your BIL is the Golden Child and your husband is the Scapegoat. Your husband is probably holding back multiple instances where their parents picked his brother over him, and this is just the final straw. 

Why would you be showing up to ruin christmas? Why would they phrase it that way? Because in their heads his refusal to see that BIL is great and doesn’t do anything wrong is bad. 

Go enjoy Christmas with your family. Make sure your husband feels loved and supported and knows that he is in the right here. Don’t let your in laws manipulate you into sweeping this all under the rug. "

110,"&gt; Then you didn’t even call him when you noticed the fruit basket was gone. When you noticed the sunflowers, card, and fruit were tossed. Not because you didn’t want to or otherwise couldn’t, but because he was going to get mad. 

Yes, this. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around your future husband. It can be a warning sign that you're in a controlling/abusive relationship. It can also be a sign that you're letting yourself be a ""cool girl""/doormat and need to establish better boundaries."

115,"Hey so my ex did this to me. Lots of sites, FB, chatted with women he knew from school but also sex workers. I caught him, he deleted everything, and then proceeded to set up new secret accounts. We went to couples counselling and everything. He promised it was just online, that it was just a form of porn to him - until I found messages trying to arrange to meet people.

Long story short, he's only telling you now because he got caught, he's telling you the bare minimum he has to and he'll lie if he thinks he can get away with it.

Don't stay. If he's the kind of person who is willing to do this to you, don't risk yourself, your heart and your time."
116,Your father is horrible. Please don't believe a word he says and don't let him bully you about your weight or grades.
117,"&gt;I almost feel like dropping the whole relationship before it gets more serious. 

So do that.  And on your way out the door, be straight with him:  he will never have a quality relationship with another woman as long as he make it clear that as long as he allows her to keep him on the leash to his bad boy past.   He essentially belongs to her and is happy with that situation."
118,"She’s asking you to lie and misrepresent. That’s all you need to explain to her. Firmly and gently say “I don’t lie”. And don’t be or say sorry to her over this. 

As a parental adult figure in her life, you will help her in the long run, by not caving into to her manipulative demands. She is still mentally a child (judging from what you wrote) and sounds like she needs firm boundaries and correction. 

As a step parent I know it’s a delicate act to win the kids over yet still be an authoritative figure. But she needs this. Good luck "
119,"There are a lot of moving parts here. First and foremost, have boundaries with your in-laws been a problem in the past? Just wondering. 

That being said, you are completely in the right here about not letting your premie around these people and you need to do your job as a parent and protect your baby first. 

Have you talked to your doctor here? Maybe you can use them as an authority figure here. ""I can't visit, doctor says that it's what is best for my baby."" ""Do not touch him! The doctor said so!"" etc."

121,"Let me start out by saying that I am happily married and have been married for over two decades.  But I am still hurt by an exgirlfriend that cheated on me many years ago.  We were the couple everyone looked to.  We went everywhere together.  I was invited to all her family get togethers.  She was smart and very attracted to me.  She couldn't keep her hands off of me when we were together. We, I thought had a great relationship.  I worked some nights during the week but always asked off for a weekend night to take her out.  On the nights I was working she was hooking up with another guy.  He never took her out on dates.  He just went to her house to hook up.  She did this for a year before I found out.  I was the safe stable guy with a job while he was the guy who was getting her on the side.  He knew all about our relationship.  All of her family knew and never told me.  Even today 30 years later I sometimes think of her betrayal and how I looked like such a fool to so many people.  How I was used and taken advantage.  I have no good feelings for her but I am still bothered how she could use me so easily.  Now I wouldn't break down over it but I have talked about it over the years and used it as a teachable moment with my kids.  

&amp;#x200B;

She probably has no feelings for her ex but the betrayal still hurts. "
122,"She's made a decision that she believes is in the best interest of her mental health. Whether the solution she came up with is right or wrong, she has the right to make those choices and it's really wonderful that you're trying to respect that.

However. You also get to make choices for the sake of your mental health. And depending on how long this goes on, those choices might include not allowing her back into your life at the same closeness as before when she comes back. If part of your coping involves moving on, you're not required to re-accommodate her into your life when she wants you to, you get choices too."
123,"&gt;He’s told me that now I know he’s into guys that he hasn’t felt into them as much and that he’s only been feeling horny and yearning love from me instead of his porn

While it's really tempting to find comfort in this and a glimmer of hope, don't. This is a change in his perception of himself and one step in a multi-step journey of self-acceptance. I'm sorry, this is so difficult. I'm sure there must be a thousand questions in your mind. Barring all the emotional stuff, the fundamental question is, ""what will I give up by being with him this way?"" If you meet someone and that person wants to be with you and only you, what will you do? How much time will you lose by being with someone there is no real future with in a married, meaningful way? Best friends one day, sure. Likely, even. But a partner the way you want him to be? Probably not.

Your original situation reminded me of something I've only recently become aware of, something called ask culture vs guess culture. Basically, the idea is that people tend to approach requests in one of two ways. Askers believe you can ask for anything while fully realizing and accepting the answer may be ""no."" Guessers, on the other hand, only make a request once they feel strongly certain the answer will be ""yes,"" meaning their requests tend to only come after a healthy period of observation and feeling. Part of this is because guessers tend to hate telling people ""no,"" and resent being put in the position to have to tell someone ""no."" 

In the situation with your roommate, it sounded like she was being an asker--she was ready to accept either outcome (as evidenced by her making it clear there were other possible venues for the party). My assumption is that you're more of a guesser, and that her request felt presumptuous to you. If  the roles reversed with you, the guesser, wanting to host a party in your new apartment, you probably would have spent more time getting to know your roommate and how she feels about different types of social gatherings before you'd even think of asking. If you got the sense that she was deeply introverted or shy and wouldn't want to have a lot of people around, you would decide that it's just not an option to host parties at your place.

 This sub doesn't allow links, but you can google askers vs guessers--there's a lot of interesting stuff out there that I think applies to your situation.

129,"I went to a catholic high school in a small conservative town and this happened like once a year. There’s so much secrecy and misinformation about sex because our sex Ed is an absolute joke. I actually don’t doubt that the story unfolded the way it did. 

That said, I think it’s great that you listened and then took a walk. That’s a great strategy. I hope you spend more time talking to each other about what he knows and what he doesn’t know and what both of you do and don’t want to find out about it. 

The likely story is that the million was hush money and after she gave birth the baby was given up for adoption. If he still had parental rights and the girl or her parents still had the baby, im betting they would be knocking and asking for child support. 

He should absolutely talk to his parents now that he’s an adult. He need a copy of that contract and to know what his parents signed him up for and if he has any potential liability as an adult. 

I know you don’t want to deal with it, but he may need to look her or his child up for closure or to process his emotions. You don’t have to be a part of that. 

You can step back from him or stay with him. You will need to talk through this if you stay. Why did he hide it from you for so long? Did he ever plan to tell you? What did he fear would happen? He’s not blameless in this situation but I can understand why he didn’t tell you and why he maybe felt he couldn’t. 

Regularly check in on how you feel about this. You’re going to feel a lot of emotions and this may be a dealbreaker or not. Take care of yourself and don’t put all of your energy into making him feel ok. "

147,"&gt; She says her episode was a result of the pain from the betrayal, not from feelings for him.

Why don't you believe her when she says this, do you have reason to disbelieve her when she tells you other things?"
148,"Wow wtf. So he left you there, knew you didn't show up at home ALL NIGHT and never went to find you? He just fucking left you laying in the street and then never wondered where you were? What if you got picked up by someone or you choked on your vomit? 

What a total piece of shit."
149,"I think your heart's in the right place and I'm glad this bothers you. But if I were your gf, I would not report it either, because it was a guy at a gun range. If it was a HIPAA violation or something, sure. But for me, the risks of some crazy, creepy guy who knows how to shoot a gun accurately coming after me are way too high to outweigh the maybe 30% chance that the manager/owner actually does something. *And* if he does get fired, that also may be what sets him off to go after her.

Edit: HIPPA - I'm an idiot"
150,"your age gap is fine. it *wouldn't* have been fine when you were 14 and he was 17, but when you were 18 and he was 21 it was fine, and it continues to be fine. Your mom needs to think of a real problem to worry about."
151,"You need to focus on the ANGER he displayed here. He didn't just put these things in the trash, he took the time to DESTROY the card first. He may have put on a really amazing show up to this point to make you think he's a calm/sweet person, but his guy has some RAGE in him. And he's not apologetic about it AT ALL. He's not expressing remorse or asking for forgiveness. He's making up excuses and doubling-down. 

THIS IS A GIANT GOD DAMN RED FLAG, OP. "
152,"This was what was in the card according to OP:

""It was very short and sweet. He wrote his own note that said, “Though you only make up a very small part of my life, your presence fulfills my eternity. Happy Holidays Ladybug (my nickname).”

He also did not get a gift for anyone else in the office. He also created the nickname for her. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a simple xmas office present. "
153,Let go. His priorities and problems are not yours to own. Everyone deserves to be loved and appreciated in there most intimate relationships. This will never happen in this situation. 
154,"Has your mother had an extreme outburst like this before? If not, rule out any medical problems like a brain tumor or the recent onset of psychiatric symptoms. Otherwise, support your father and what he wants. He was physically attacked for no reason, without so much as a conversation, by his wife. If they get back together, your mother must understand that her behavior was completely unacceptable and abhorrent. She should get counseling for what seems to be paranoia and anxiety. Again, she physically attacked your father for no reason—don’t push this under the rug."
155,"Its really weird that he first assumed “cheating”.

I mean, not answering your phone for a few hours could mean literally anything.   You forgot your phone.   You’re having a bubble bath.   You’re weeding the garden.  You went to a movie.  You’re (legitimately) having (literal) coffee with a (platonic) friend and set your phone on silent.   

If it was incredibly out of character - as in, enough to raise alarm bells, it’s *still* weird that he jumped to “cheating” instead of “had an accident”, “is stuck somewhere”, “some emergency has happened”.  

The insta-accusation is a pretty heavy blow.   BF has just admitted how little he actually trusts you.   Do not rug sweep this one - this needs to be addressed, or it will get worse.   I understand the anxiety, and I imagine that having been cheated on makes him extra sensitive to anything that might be a sign.   It’s valid to expect some sympathy and support from you as he works through this - but it is equally valid for you to expect at least some measure of trust.   "
156,"OP, because of your example in your dad and this relationship with June, maybe consider if you should get some counseling. There's a link there. You've had one main person in your life setting a basis of how you should expect to be treated by the other important people in your life. You found June and if you don't work on this, you'll find more guys like that. Work on you, break that cycle. Maybe stay single for a while, til you at least have some distance from this past relationship and you can identify a few red flags that happened. Maybe check loveisrespect.org, if you haven't already. Your mom might want to stay, but you can make a different choice.



"
157,"He didn’t offer, he was voluntold "
158,Yeah that fucking creep was trying to sext with you. Show your friend. 
159,"That’s my logic. They asked me for a favor so it isn’t on me to keep hounding for more details, they should’ve provided it."
160,"""Bye.""

People try too hard to salvage unsalvageable relationships. Move on. "
161,Is there a reason you haven't taken the issue straight to HR?
162,"“No, it’s still creepy.” “That’s gross.” “I don’t want to hear that.” Etc, etc... Be serious when you respond to him, and don’t sound like you’re going along with his “jokes”."
163,"Oh she did. She told her sister, 8 yr old brother, and mom I was trying not only to cut her out of the present but her entire birthday."
164,I dated a guy that would refuse to drop me off at my car or pick me up from my car no matter how late at night and eventually he admitted it was because he didn’t really care if something happened to me. We broke up and it was the best decision I ever made because after that I dated my now life partner who is the kind of person who would walk a mile in the rain if it meant keeping me safe (and I’d do the same for him). 
165,"OP in case you had ANY doubt about whether he's actually a sweet dude or not, this answered that. You escaped a man willing to travel to another country just to torment his ex. That's some next level scary, twisted shit."
166,"She said he should “play it by ear”... well he heard nothing from them so he did in fact play it by ear, she’s mad he did what she asked. "
167,"&gt;genuine concern/anger that the sis was lost and in danger

She was a 23 year old in an unfamiliar airport, she wasn't in any actual danger. She chose to get on an airplane without confirming she had a way to her friend's place. It's not your responsibility to manage the choices of others."
168,"Dump him. Now way in hell that a discharge covered panty can accidentally end up in your sweatshirt.

Personal experience, I was casually hooking up with someone when I was in his city. I noticed during sex that on the counter there was a whole Valentines Day display made for him complete with a card, teddy bear, sappy crap, balloons, etc., and looking deeper it was clear that a girl had moved in with him. 

He meant nothing to me at all, but I used a tissue to blot my lipstick, and dropped it in a makeup drawer as a little warning signal to the girl because he is trash. 
"
169,"Right? From the title, I was expecting that some dude had broke into her apartment to shower, she walked in on the dude and he ran out naked while her boyfriend was coming in and saw the whole thing.

This...this is just weird."
170,"He should have discussed this with you before the loans were taken. You don’t let someone start working and set a budget and ambush them like this. 

Edit. I missed that this happened after OP’s parents divorced. And after OP told him that they may have cancer and definitely need surgery. Father is an absolute shitbag. "
171,"I have often been the one having to take care of drunk friends. It’s sucks! It’s annoying, frustrating, sometimes disgusting and occasionally frightening. I would NEVER leave someone passed out outside! No matter hiw angry I was at them at the time, I would never wish harm on them, and leaving someone incapacetated in public is an incredible high risk of harm.

If someone have acted inappropriate whilst drunk, drank irresponsible, or have a pattern of causing issues with their they need to take respinsibilty and adress their behaviour. WHEN THEY ARE SOBER! You passing out outside isn’t you dealing with the consequences of your adult decisions, it’s you being in a bad situation. The first priority is to keep you *safe*, then deal with the consequences.

There is no excuze for this imo. No matter how angry someone was or that it was completly on you, the correct thing for any person to do is try to keep you from harm. Not just a friend, but anyone. There are so many bad things that could have happened to you. I simple do not understand the mindset ”I’m angry at you, so I’m okay with you getting hurt.”

I could not be friends with someone that was willing to let me get hurt out of anger. I simply could not feel trust for them, and without trust there can be no type of relationship."
172,"She’s not that much older than you, and if she shielded you, who shielded her? I imagine she probably got to the point where she had to put her health first because she was dealing with too much.

I would personally, go in with as much love as I could muster because it’s only you two."
173,She's an adult so like any other adult you tell her to get over it. There really isn't anything to talk about. Don't respond to her anger at all. It'll only validate her tantrum.
174,"Don't go home. Be honest about needing a peaceful break, and the unfairness of the situation. Or, rent a room at a cheao motel and meet your family places, and book your soare tine up with activities you enjoy so you can just point blank say no without the guilt."
175," 

&gt;\*\*\*update: I just got a message from my mom this morning that reads: “I don't know what you said to F but...wow. I won't message you anymore... You will need her permission first.”

177,"I wouldn't leave a girl who was a stranger to me passed out drunk on the sidewalk, much less a friend. Mark sounds like an asshole. If you are regularly getting trashed and he is tired of cleaning up after you, that would be one thing, but it sounds like this was a one-time occurrence and he just bailed on you. Literally anything could have happened while you were knocked out, OP. I'm glad you're safe. I don't think it's worth bring it up again with him because he seems self righteous as fuck and he'll probably just blame you some more, but you should not rely on him in the future as your ride home or going out buddy. "
178,"No no no no no no no no. 

Get your stuff and leave, right now. It doesn’t matter what you did, no one deserves to be treated like this, and he doesn’t get to brand you to show you your place. Get out. The relationship is dead and he’s going to keep punishing you forever. Run. "
179,"I'm glad you reported her to the management company. Report any other aggression you get from her. Are you friendly with any neighbors? Ask them about their experiences with her and encourage them to report her, too.

They can and will do something if they hear about her enough."
180,I was expecting that he pushed you or hurt you in some way on purpose. 6 years is way too long for you to still be actively angry with him over this. 
181,"I learned something from a company dinner yesterday from lean or some related management program.

If you’re going to fail anyway, do it quickly."
182,I think you mean gift receiving.
183,"Hold it up in front of him and say “what’s this?” And make him explain it. If he’s like, “it’s yours” say nope and stay quiet and let him explain it. He knows where it’s from and he knows it’s not yours. I feel like you’ll regret it if you let him talk you into believing a lie. He’ll say it’s always been there, but you know it hasn’t. He’ll say it got in your laundry by mistake- so the other woman’s discharge made it through the washer and dryer? I don’t think so. Sorry girl. "
184,"&gt;I have told them numerous times they need to figure out their differences on their own as adults and **stop bringing me into it.**

That attitude will be written on the tombstone of your dead marriage if you don't fix it.

Dude, it's *your mother* so **you** brought your wife into this mess. You're supposed to be a team when you're married. And the person with the difficult family (ie, you) is *always* responsible for helping manage conflict between their spouse and their family.

You're fucking up pretty bad here. And you seem to be determined to plug your ears and stick your head in the sand, despite your wife telling you that you need marriage counseling. If that doesn't' wake you up then IDK what will."
185,"Spot on. They fucked up, so OP is the fall guy."
186,"There's a lot of arguing on this thread, so even though I don't have anything original to say, I want to throw in another voice saying that I think you should stick by your guns and tell your mom that a family Christmas is going to be completely impossible, and you have XYZ compromises to offer which don't involve your wife sharing space with your brother, and she has to pick one if she wants you to be at Christmas at all, with a side of ""you know it's not going to be a happy family Christmas even if we all come, you'll feel our discomfort.""

Some compromise suggestions (first options bolded because you should push for one of these two first):

**1) Your mom sees one brother and then she sees the other, both on Christmas Day but not together.**

**2) Completely separate Christmases.**

3) You and your wife come in the morning with no brother there, brother comes at dinner, you all sit together around the dinner table for an hour or two where he's a minimal risk, and then leave directly after dinner while brother spends the evening with your parents.

3a) If your mom refuses to manage your brother, only get there for dinner and leave afterwards.

4) You and your wife have Christmas dinner together while your brother hangs out with your parents all day, after dinner you (alone) go to your parents for a few hours, and then spend a few hours with your parents and brother and then come home.

4a) Or after a few hours your mom has your brother leave so your wife can join you.

5) Figure out a few hours in the afternoon where you and your wife are comfortable with you (alone) leaving, and spend those few hours with your parents and brother as a ""family"" and then leave. Have Christmas morning and dinner with your wife.

5a) Go together but limit it to a few hours and stick together.

*The option of ""Go the whole day and guard wife"" should not be considered, imo.*

187,"It's only been a few months and you're already feeling uneasy about things. And for good reason, too:

&gt; I did not enjoy their sense of humor together. Joking about doing hard drugs together until they were so fucked up they had no idea what was happening, stuff like that. He seemed pretty different from the man I had gotten to know.

I'd pay close attention to the person he is with his ""closer than family"" best friend, because that's likely the real him. At this point in your relationship, you're not dating the real him, you're dating his representative. Sounds like he's not even bothering to keep up the performance when she's around.

Plus if she's always going to be around, do you really want this to be your life? "
188,"Sorry, but even if he's broke, he could have gotten a card for you or something reasonable on sale. He didn't even try. He had time, and he didn't feel you were worth it. Your initial instincts are right--time to cut this off. "
189,"Yikes, indeed. This is even more reason that you need to practice setting boundaries now, before she does have a baby and expects you to babysit at the drop of a hat because you’re already watching two babies, what’s one more? There is a stepparents subreddit you could check out for some more specific advice (not sure the link, sorry). "
190,"It's okay that you're feeling this way. You've been feeling like this for years and only started addressing it a few months ago. There is absolutely no reason for you to be over it now. There's no linear timeline for grief, anger, or healing. 

What if you just accepted that this is how you're feeling right now and decided not to make any big life-entangling decisions with him for at least another year? What if you set times (once every couple of months?) to have a state-of-the-marriage talk with your therapist, so that you can track your feelings? 

Ultimately, it's okay if you decide you want to stay and need serious time to heal. It's also okay if you decide that the damage is too much and you want to leave. Keep taking care of yourself. "
191,"OP, reading through your past posts/comments makes it clear you’ve got your head in the sand here.

**Your husband has physically cheated on you in the past**. You also caught him sexting other women.

If he cared a single bit about your relationship, he would be taking every step possible to rebuild trust, and would completely respect your boundaries with this “mutual friend”.

Instead, he is *very clearly emotionally cheating*, and then dismissing your valid concerns.

Your husband is a cheater. Period. How many times does it take for you to recognize that?

Drop this disrespectful, uncaring, cheating asshole, and move on. Every day spent with him is a day you’ll later regret."
192,"You mom is...not stable. 

Either that or she wants out of this marriage for unrelated reasons, and is just using this bizarre accusation as a cover for her real feelings. Only she knows for sure. Either way, you’ve already done all you can do. She was presented with the truth and your supporting evidence and she rejected all of it. It’s up to her and your dad to figure out what this means for their marriage - the best thing you can do is stay out of the middle. Hopefully your dad can figure out her motivations here and take appropriate action. "
193,"These are great points to get legal involved. Hopefully, my sibs will see it this way too."
194,"Unpaid care labor by women is one of the single most unfair things left over from the bad old days.

You and your family should be working together for your mom.  And use any public sources of help that are in place for such things.

Expecting you to shoulder that work alone is just cruel.  Caregiving is grueling physical and emotional work. And in families, it tends to be work with no time off or other support.  That would be illegal if it were a paid job. So you don't get paid AND it is extreme work conditions. Not to mention that you are not able to contribute to your own household's expenses and future (even if it is just you) since you are basically doing a more than full time job.

I know this is what billions of women do the world over, but it doesn't make it right. 

 Particularly when there are other family members  and if it is just ""expected"" that you would take this on.

You are NOT required to do any of it.  It might make people mad, but that is their business.

You can choose to put limits on what you will do. Again, it might make people mad, but you can and should take care of yourself.

Unless you are in one of the countries where women have no rights, your family can not ""make"" you do it. They might guilt you or yell at you or get mad, but they can not make you.  And my question to them would be...why aren't you doing it? why don't you feel guilty?

My personal experience is that most reasonable people might initially get irritated or mad about having to pitch in or being called out for not...but they get over it because they are reasonable.

Selfish assholes will continue to mad.  Because they are selfish assholes. They don't want their unpaid labor to go away.

I suspect that you are willing to care for your mom some, but on some level realize that it is too big a job for one person. Because it is.  There are women that do it, but it destroys them physically.

You can be a good person and still set limits.

In fact, my experience is that the best people-the ones who can be there for you in a crisis and can have balanced relationships the rest of the time-set the most limits and set them clearly.  Doormats get resentful and end up doing wacky things because they get stretched past their limits.

"
195,"He broke his phone in two the night he told me about the prostitutes he was messaging. You're both right. I told him I discovered the messages about an hour ago and he said he ""jacked off on her feet"" the first time and the second time she ""sucked his dick"". I'm tryin to figure myself out at the moment. 

I think I'll be leaving to visit my family and best friend in Georgia and he can be alone for Christmas to pick up his mess. I set an appointment with a counselor a few days ago and I'm setting an appointment with my primary physician to get tested. 

I'm so fucking scared I'm going to find out I have something but my mom has been begging me to go as it was her parents who died from AIDS. I feel horrible that I've put this weight on her. She is my favorite person on this Earth and I'm sure she would be upset had I not said anything.

"
196,"\&gt;  Am I overreacting to being so hurt? 

No. His family were xenophobic assholes to your parents. Your parents were guests who they knew were visiting from out of the country, they should have accommodated them and spoke in a mutual language. 

Your boyfriend should be able to admit when his parents are being wrong instead of making excuses for them. "
197,It sounds like you did everything right except for not firing the realtor faster.  I think at this point you just sort of let the friend drift until they figure their shit out.
198,"This is definitely his paranoia shaping his reality of the situation— you did absolutely nothing wrong. Just be confident and steadfast in your truth. Either he’ll come around with time. or it isn’t worth it to convince him. You can’t make him believe something he refuses to even try, you know?"
199,"Such a wonderful update, OP. This is should be the standard post that shows how your SO can have a friendship of the opposite sex and there's nothing going on, because all parties involved are open, up front and transparent about everything. 

My husband I each have opposite gender friends and this is exactly how we are. We are all open with each other, we all are friends, there's no hiding people or acting odd about it or making excuses or unfriendliness. 

That's the difference I wish people would see. I'm happy this all worked out for everyone. "
200,Is it possible that she got embarrassed because the free club thing fell through and didn't want to admit it you?
201,"Under no circumstances should you meet with this woman.  Involvement with her would add nothing positive to your life.   You should not validate her interest in you or your husband in any way.

&gt;By husband hadn’t said anything to her because he doesn’t want to hurt her feelings. 

Why does he care about her feelings at all?  She's become a nuisance, he should be doing whatever it takes to shut it down.   Back up his phone and make a copy of all these inappropriate messages.   Then tell him that if he doesn't shut her down definitively, you will take all the messages to the hospital HR and get her fired.   See whose feelings he's worried about then."
202,"OP also left out the ladybug part in the original post.  The rest is there, but the nickname isn't.  I wonder if maybe OP knows exactly how this Jason dude feels and was hoping that Reddit would tell her that everything is cool"
203,She probably wants to be with him. If she won’t stop the harassment he should complain to his bosses. 
204,"When people are wrong, and have been proved wrong, they respond in one of two ways.

Either they accept that they were wrong and try and move forward like an adult. Or they lash out and get mad at others because they can't admit they were wrong.

Your girlfriend is showing you what kind of person she is. Believe her.  

Honestly this would be a deal breaker for me.
"
205,"You should definitely visit a lawyer because your relationship is 100 percent over. Why drag this out? She has literally no intention of fixing things or stopping this. What are you going to do, just sleep in separate bedrooms until she finally files for divorce? Might as well get on with it."
206,"I’m divorced with a couple of kids. My ex physically abused me, which was well documented and uncontested during the custody trial. Despite this, he has custody every other weekend and one weeknight per week because he never hurt or threatened to hurt the kids. I fought with every fiber of my being to get full custody but my lawyer told me that when both parents are fighting for custody, they very rarely assign 100% custody to one parent unless there is a current active threat of physical harm to the kids. Additionally she told me that I should never speak badly about my ex to my kids because the courts frown upon attempts at parental alienation and it could hurt me if we ever end up back in court. I believe my ex is violent and dangerous, but my kids see him regularly and I can’t say a word about it to them. It kills me every day. It would crush me if someday they grew up and believed I just turned my back and let them go with someone I thought was dangerous. "
207,"Umm I was ready to side with you until I realized a few things. 

1. It's pretty telling that you gave your *coworker* a name in this, but not your *fiance*. 



2. It is also telling that you completely left out the bit about him writing you ""...your presence fulfills my eternity..."" followed by *his* specific nickname for you *on the card* attached to your *favorite flowers*. I had to scroll quite a ways down through the comments to see this. 

You are completely ""blind"" to what Jason's intentions are here. Should your fiance have reacted that way? No. But I can't say I wouldn't be pretty pissed if my fiance accepted a gift like that and acted like it was *nothing*.  


Edited to add quotes, because she isn't blind-- she very well knows what is happening and is playing dumb and being manipulative, given the contents of her comments. "
208,They're sending a strong message that this is what happens if you don't play into the dynamic they've built. Sounds like a perfect opportunity to detach.
209,The Human Resources person acted wildly inappropriately.  No complaint should ever be dismissed or taken lightly.  This might be complaint worthy in itself.  I’d go to that hr persons boss and describe the events as you told them here.  If the tables were turned you can bet a complaint against your bf wouldn’t be taken this lightly.
210,"&gt; Should I break up with her?

Yes, you don't have a choice. No explanation can fix this. 

**She cannot be allowed anywhere near your brother.**"
211,"She is very big on gift giving. Last year her wishlist of ‘secondary gifts’ included a $70 stapler.

EDIT: After thinking it over, I don’t know if it’s the gift thing. Her husband makes a lot of money and their lifestyle is lavish."
212,"&gt; said he ""jacked off on her feet"" the first time and the second time she ""sucked his dick""

First it was just pricing.  Now this.  You know that's still not all there is.  He's trickle-truthing you.  In addition to a counselor and a doctor, you need to see a divorce lawyer.  Don't wait to find a lawyer.  If your husband starts shopping around for one himself, the lawyers he talks to can be conflicted out of working for you whether he ends up hiring them or not."
213,"Upgrading your engagement ring is incredibly common, I don’t think other commenters here realize that. Styles change over time, and of course people earn more money as time goes on so they’re able to afford something they like better. It’s not new - people have been doing it for generations. My father upgraded his wedding ring in his 40s. He replaced the one he got when he married my mother as poor grad student back in the day with a simpler, more grown-up looking band made of a higher quality metal. It’s something you wear every day and should suit you and be comfortable.

You can always incorporate the stone from the ring he gave you. And you could upgrade his wedding band at the same time too as a nice gift."
214,Sounds like a woman wanted you to find those.
215,"It's completely reasonable, even recommended, not to take a newborn preemie to a holiday gathering where they will be exposed to everyone else's germs.  There will plenty of time when the baby is older and stronger for him/her to bond with family members."
216,The fact that she is using her child speaks volumes for her character. OP should run.
217,I'd tell them to just fucking drop it or you'll just tell the whole damn family what happened and then they can see some real drama. 
218,"&gt;we were frustrated bc we took her out and thought we had a good time. 

&gt; That made me so livid because I was the one who invited her to the lake and reassured her I liked her! 

&gt;My boyfriend and I are super confused because we don’t know why she is lashing out at him. We spent a lot of time with her at the lake and I thought she was having a good time with us.

Guess what, she will never have a good enough time being just friends with you and your boyfriend. That's not what she wants. 

She has a crush on him and she wants to hang out with him alone, where she can pretend you don't exist and that she's his ""work wife"" who he really wants. 

Or, if you're forced to all hang out together, she wants him to be at her side, making her laugh with inside jokes, while you sit there ignored with your arms crossed and a sour expression.

No amount of happy, fun, friendly times with you could ever make her happy, because that isn't what she means when she says, ""he's not being a good friend to me!"""
219,"She must be so creeped out that a guy she dated for 3 months is still so obsessed 2 years later, especially when he’s dating someone else. "
220,"Sounds like postpartum depression, but if you really want to leave, file for full custody and take on the role yourself. There's daycare for this. I mean, how do you think single mothers deal with it?"
221,"Jeez, this is simple.     

You roommate, she's not your friend, is self centered, and rude, she makes herself feel better by tearing you down.     Friends don't treat friends the way she treats you.  

She's ""seems"" like she's got things together, but she chasing self esteem/self worth by having sex with a lot of guys.  She's toxic in pretty much every direction, ans she's fooled you into a) thinking she's your friend and b) believing the lies that come out of her mouth.     When she's tearing you down she's really telling you how she thinks about herself.  She's got a lot of problems.    

The way she's behaving has **NOTHING** to do with you, it's all about her.  You stop hanging out with your roommate, you need more friends, and you need to start looking for a new place/roommate in preparation for when the lease ends.  "
222,"I agree.  My mom acted crazy, off the walls, no calming her down, crazy at my sisters wedding.  Wouldn’t even talk to my sister on her wedding day, something to do with the caterers.  My mom has a flair for the dramatic as well, but we were all confused and concerned why she would treat my sister like that on her wedding day.  We found out she had thyroid imbalance/hormone imbalance and got on medication to stable it.  Might not be mental, might be hormonal? 
Good luck! "
223,I told him this and he says that it’s his house too and he was uncomfortable with having it in his home. He’s being so unbelievable
224,"Dude, don’t do it. You can’t help. You’re no match for a violent 200 pound psychotic dude. 

I know your pain. My family is the epitome of staying in terrible situations out of love and familial obligation. They would beg me to come and see them in these awful situations they created and wouldn’t fix at all. It made me resentful and I’d just get angry because I’d give up things I wanted to do to waste time seeing them just to have them make me feel totally awful. Don’t do it. You’ll hate your family and yourself. Keep telling them to get help and send him somewhere "
225,"Makeup is commonly marketed as a thing for women and feminine men (typically no burly, rugged men in makeup commercials). Most people usually assume feminine men are gay (as they assume feminine women are straight). That's probably why your friends are questioning your sexuality over makeup. 

Reality: makeup is for anyone. Makeup can be used to make you look more feminine or masculine or alien or whatever. It is a simply a tool used to change your appearance. Wanting to change your appearance/look better does not make you gay (women like men with clear skin, sex symbols are not running around with acne) 

Explain this to your friends, then tell them to fuck off, and keep doing you. 

Also, drink a crap ton of water and rinse/wash your face after you work out/get a sweaty face. (Better and cheaper than any product out there. Cleared up my acne like you wouldn't believe.) "
226,"I know this was a big shock. What I’m hearing in that story is that he was a kid, she was a kid, and it was a big fuck up. He likely didn’t have much of a say in this and she probably didn’t either. I don’t think you have to worry about her showing up, I mean it’s possible but not probable. I’d be super surprised if that baby wasn’t given up for adoption honestly. I don’t think he didn’t tell you because he wanted to hide it from you, it sounds like he’s never fully processed it. I think it would be a mistake to do what you probably want to do which is to make him look her up. I think this is something that was way in the past, legally he was a child, and I don’t think it will come back to bite him. "
227,"To be clear:

* Your girlfriend signed you up for a 40 minute drive without asking 

* Aforementioned drive is while you’re working

* Your girlfriend and her mother blow up your phone WHILE YOU ARE WORKING to verbally abuse you

* Your girlfriend blames you for not being a psychic

Get out of this relationship and don’t marry into this family."
228,I would be the asshole to the in laws and ask them if they are sure on the paternity of the child. But thats just me. 
229,"Yep, that was my brother’s wife exact reaction when we showed her a younger photo of me and the child. "

231,"He is a dishwasher at a local dive bar with several felonies, and she has quit beauty school, dental assisting school, and college. It's a disaster that is so ridiculous that makes me dizzy. "
232,"Your mother threatened to cut you out of her life because of the child and now she's using that same connection for financial gain. Completely disgusting thing to do and I really don't think I could forgive my mother for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were you, I would contact the family and apologize for your mother. Explain how she's being manipulative and that they shouldn't be supporting her financially. If you are able, I would consider trying to pay back some of the money your mother accepted and try to handle this with as much as as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

If you never want a relationship with your son, that's perfectly fine and something most people would understand. If you ever change your mind, you want to keep that door open but regardless, you wouldn't want that family to be financially strained by your mother. That's not fair to them and that strain certainly is not fair to a 16 year old who's probably planning on going to college in a few years. "
233,"What? No! She's projecting the fact that she's cheating and secretly has two kids! He should break up with her immediately, hit the gym, delete Facebook, immediately, because we know better than him about his own relationship! (/s, in case it wasn't obvious)"
234,"“Respect my place or find your own.” 

Their age difference above you doesn’t even matter because cleaning up after yourself,especially when someone has been gracious enough to let you stay in their home (I assume for free), is something a child should be capable of. "
235,"Hi, I'm sorry this is happening.  What you appear to be asking is for your dad's GF to treat you differently than she is.  Others have advised on how to get the food you want by being more independent but that doesn't address what I think is your main point.

Unfortunately, you aren't going to be able to change this woman's behavior.  Based on what you wrote here, you are likely not going to be able to change your dad's behavior, either.  Your dad may be able to get her to change her ways but given you're only going to be there a few more months, do you want to bother with what could be a waste of time?

If so, you need to convince your dad that her behavior is making managing your bulimia worse.  I would approach it like ""Dad, bulimia is about how I view my body.  When GF hides my food, I interpret that as her saying I'm fat and what caused me to purge before was believing that I was fat.  Her behavior is causing me to want to do that again, which could seriously harm me.  Please tell her to stop hiding food from me.""  If he laughs you off, ask him how a risk to your health is in any way funny.

If he can't be convinced, then at least you'll know how your life rates when compared to his GF's frugality.  Then, when you move out, you can never look back.  Good luck!"
236,"To all of the people saying “maybe it doesn’t have anything to do with your eating disorder and you should just buy your own food”, the girlfriend started this behavior as a direct response to finding out about the bulimia, while OP was either still in high school or just starting college.

If her parents have agreed to financially support her while she finishes her education, that’s their choice, and there isn’t anything wrong with that. And sure, she could buy her own food, but that would be sweeping the underlying relationship issue under the rug. It sounds like her dads girlfriend doesn’t have an issue with OP eating food in the house, she has an issue with her “wasting” it by throwing it up (which is a horrible thing to say to someone with bulimia btw).

Eating disorders are not about being fat, they’re not even really about food itself, they are about control. OP, I can only imagine how hurtful it would be to have your dads girlfriend try to control what you eat because she doesn’t trust your ability to care for your own mental health. You should be really proud of yourself for successfully recovering, it’s a really difficult and painful process not unlike recovering from drug addiction. It makes perfect sense to be upset that your dads girlfriend treats you like you still have an eating disorder and cannot be “trusted” around food, because it makes it seem like everything you worked for to overcome this disease doesn’t matter to her. 

Since you don’t have a great relationship with her, I would just wait the few months until you move out. That your dad has a habit of sweeping your feelings under the rug to placate his girlfriend so is a separate issue entirely, and might be best addressed in a family therapy session since it’s been going on for over a decade.

Edit: fixed typo"
237,"Also, from their POV, this was a mistake. (It isn't actually one because you had zero responsibility but we'll play along.) Is this really the appropriate response to an honest mistake? A woman you've met once called and cussed you out... Do you really want to be a part of that family?"
238,"Say that after the first date you pretty much forgot all about the other girl, because of how gorgeous and amazing your girlfriend is. Make sure to compliment her more for the next few days, and doing some romantic things wouldn't be bad either. Especially if you're worried about an ED relapse. 

Sometimes we don't want a proper explanation, sometimes we just want comforting.

239,"&gt;Wife's brother does not trust her to drive on the highway, requires her to drive on side-roads to pick-up/drop-off niece at school which is 45-60min one way from our home.

This is completely insane. Is there a reason or some background for this? Has your wife been in a recent accident on the freeways? Has her brother and he has some PTSD? 

I can't wrap my mind around dictating the nature of the transportation provided for free babysitting."

""Emptying the dryer? Sure."""
241,"Regardless of her actual intent, I don't think I want to sleep next to someone who wrote erotica about my sibling. The possible actual pedophilia is like... dealbreaker icing on dealbreaker cake. I personally would just gtfo. "
242,"Look up the Grey Rock technique. She probably enjoys the reaction she gets from bragging so if you don't engage her at all when she's making nasty comments, you cut off that source of validation for her. ""Okay"" is a perfectly acceptable response to her criticizing your ring."
243,"&gt; She's a stunner with a career.

No she's not, she's a psychopath. If she's such a stunning happy person drowning in men, why would she need to go after your boyfriend? The answer is that there's something seriously wrong with her. 

&gt;  if I wasn't there, he'd happily have said yes to her

Paul would never be happy with her, because she doesn't like making people happy, she likes making people feel like shit. You're psyching yourself out with a negative what if scenario. What if her poison had never touched your life? Would you still feel that bad about yourself compared to others? Probably not, because I bet a lot of negative thoughts were put in your head by her.

Leaving your job sounds like a great plan to me. She's really bad for your mental health and she hasn't changed one bit from the bully she used to be."
244,At 18 it's almost impressive that shes been able to drop out of 3 schools.
245,"You need to stop questioning her immediately and get a professional. Parents are not equipped to do this. With kids this young it is very easy to cover up the truth or create a story because they pick up on your feelings and facial expressions and 2 year olds don’t really have a way to differentiate between reality and fantasy.

Please be proactive with this. My mother didn’t protect me and I can’t help but wonder now if she didn’t notice or if she was complicit."
246,"I think I’ve been sleep walking for most of this relationship, and have only now realised how unhappy I am. She will refuse outside help as in therapy. She thinks therapy is for nutters. She’s very prejudice against mental health or anything that doesn’t sit within her bubble and how she thinks life should be. 

I’m literally sitting in a car in tears right now dreading going home. I have to get my shit together because if I don’t get home soon I won’t hear the end of it. "
247,OP definitely set the precedent that you won’t be asking for money in the future. That will make your position far more believable. 
248,I hope you realise that he’s going to drop you the day after you get the tattoo. Run. Now. 
249,"&gt;Even after I had been in labor for 22 hours, with him getting to sleep through over half of it, complains that he’s tired and says I’m better with less sleep than he is.

WTF, does this not just enrage you to the breaking point alone? Just, holy shit. He's either obtuse as fuck or lacks basic empathy. I'd really like to know what you had to say to that."
250,"This. She’s already had someone really overstep and make her feel uncomfortable and embarrassed- don’t compound this by assuming that you know best. The fear is real, she’s likely navigated this and stuff like it before and to insist on a confrontation without her agreement is not going to make her feel any better."
251,"Others have done a great job with the emotional pieces, but as far as the financial pieces: she's committed identity theft and fraud. Sadly, a lot of narcs do this to their kids too (both underage and adult). Once you hit 18, you can start the process of straightening out your credit. There are a ton of resources online and on Reddit that deal with this specific situation. You are not alone. Your mom will be in legal trouble, but your credit and adult life will not be ruined due to her poor decisions. Hang in there, it does and can get better. xo"
252,"Dude. What the fuck. 

Drop the drug idea. Entirely. Stick to EXACTLY what your doctor prescribed you. And then *call a lawyer.* This marriage is a complete disaster and frankly you do not come out of this post smelling good. It sounds like your wife, whatever flaws she may have, is actually trying, and you’re just going through the motions hoping she’ll finally give up and be the “bad guy.” You’re lying to her, you’re shit-talking your children, and you’re acting like this is all totally outside of your control. 

Get. Your. Shit. Together. If you want out of this marriage, then get out of it. If you want partial custody of your kids, then find a lawyer who will help you negotiate it. If you want to change treatments for your depression, *talk to your damn doctor* instead of ordering random shit on the internet. For fucks sake, you’re 32. Enough. "
253,"I was dating a guy long distance. I knew he was moving and *assumed* we would also break up. I was a fair bit younger, he was moving for some new, exciting opportunities and I figured hitting the dating scene would be part of that. There was a lot of uncertainty in both our futures. And a fair bit of insecurity in mine.

So we talked about it. He reassured me that he preferred the awesome relationship he was in and now we've been married for 6 years. 

For me it was a defense mechanism. I didn't want to be heartbroken, so I just assumed the worst and tried to prepare for it."
254,"One of the cutest guys in my high school went to the beach with us once (this was 10+ years ago) and after he swam we realized he wore makeup because it washed off.  We all shrugged and figured that if it made him feel good, that was his business.  Everyone still thought he was one of the cutest guys in school."
255,Sounds like SHE is the one on drugs.
256,"&gt; Though you only make up a very small part of my life, your presence fulfills my eternity. Happy Holidays Ladybug 

Her husband may have been too aggressive about it but I wouldn't say Jason is so innocent either. Frankly, I wouldn't say such romantic words to a platonic friend especially if I'm married. ""Your presence fulfills my eternity"" Like wtf is that shit seriously. If OP found a card from a woman directed to her husband that says something like this I bet she wouldn't be so cool with it either.

262,I was married to a man who reacted similarly to things like this.  We are now divorced.

This is already such a toxic situation...I'd wonder what these kids have been told about you.  

Amanda and your father needed to plan for these kids, their ineptitude is not your responsibility."
264,"You've got to stop comparing your experiences. She lost her dad unexpectedly. While your dad's passing being expected doesn't minimize your grief, those are very different experiences. 

She's also a first year teacher. ALL first year teachers are a mess. In grad school you are responsible for you. In teaching, you are responsible for many others, and it goes far beyond just being responsible for their academics. 

I hope that you can read the responses here and gain some compassion for your partner. It doesn't sound like she needs to get her shit together, it sounds like you need to grow up. "
265,"You should not have any contact with her. She is dangerous to you, your boyfriend, your pet, and your child. If I was your boyfriend this would be my hill to die on."
266,"There are literally peta-bytes of free porn floating around the internet available 24/7/365. Every kink, fetish, etc. is there for the viewing ... and he has to jerk it to pics of a girl who was just murdered?!?!? 

So clearly something about the fact that she was just murdered sexually excites him. You have to decide for yourself if you're ok with your fiance being sexually excited by a girl's brutal murder. If my daughter told me this about her fiance, I'd be packing her bags while holding a baseball bat. 

This is _not_ a just a ""guy thing."" "
267,[deleted]
268,"Adding to this OP, don't underestimate the power of lovebombing. That's why everyone is telling you NOT to tell him you're leaving! 

If you confront him, the first thing he'll do is cry and beg and plead. He's probably not an emotional person, so his tears will shock you. ""Wow, he must be really sorry!"" is what you'll think. It's a fucking lie. If you stand your ground once he realizes the tears didn't work he will get angry. Very, very angry and I guarantee you he will hurt you a lot worse than a punch to the face. 

This is so serious. Do not tell him you're leaving. My boyfriend buys me flowers almost every week ""just because"" and this asshole, who has never **once** bought you flowers thinks it makes up for getting punched in the face?? 

Don't fall for it please. Call your grandparents and see if you can move back in. Offer to help them out, cook, clean, run errands for them, whatever they need. Find someone to stay with even if it's just a few weeks. Block him on everything and don't tell him you're leaving!"
269,"You can try to be there for her publicly, so she doesn't feel shunned.  I mean just imagine how she feels.  How repulsive her interaction with him now feels.  I would just try to be there with her in public as much as I can. "
270,"I am a busty gal also, and my mom is not, and she is like this. Basically unless I'm in a paper sack, it's either too tight or too low cut. I was maid of honor in her third wedding, and we had something custom made to cover my sin bags. Honestly I was just like, I will wear whatever as long as you are paying for it. It's not worth the fight, so pick a style, I dgaf. I'm not sure if that's an option for you. If you want to stand your ground, that's respectable, I just don't know if it's worth the headache. 

For what it's worth, I think people like my mom and your sister are the weird ones. Not everyone is that obsessed with boobs to the point where that's all they see when they look at you."
271,"You don't have to convince him of anything, because you're never seeing him again. Right?

Staying with someone who is aggressive to you while drunk is not acceptable. "
272,"I wouldn’t. And I would deeply question staying with someone who could butt thier nose into my past and judge me for it. You’ve delt with your  divorce... who the hell is your partner of 10 months to come in and demand that you handle (something that sounds functional and fine) it differently? 

That’s bizarre and kind of crappy treatment. "
273,"""Hey, do you mind not finishing my sentences?""

Try that."
274,"Oh yikes. I think you'll have to be quite blunt here. ""I love you, but you are smothering me. I absolutely need alone time and time to myself. I care about you a lot and it hurts my feelings when you say the opposite because it is not true. But I need you to know that part of who I am as a human requires me to have space and alone time at times.""

276,"When my husband and I had been dating for about a year he was told he would likely never have biological children. Even though I had always wanted bio kids, I didn't even think about leaving him. My very first instinct was ""oh well, I guess we will just have to adopt!"" I loved him so much that I was willing to rethink what I thought my future would be. Now, I'm not saying your boyfriend is a monster, but you definitely have different priorities. There are plenty of people out there who will love you for you and be perfectly fine with adopting, or using a donor egg, or whatever you want to do. I personally would not want to be with someone who was more in love with the idea of bio kids than with me. "
277,"I want to be a part of the kid’s life as long as I live. All this encouragement from Reddit was what I needed.

278,"Please listen to your girlfriend. He has all of her personal information (including her home address), he just got rejected by her (it's not unheard of for men to respond to rejection with violence), and he works at a shooting range. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the impulse to report this huge invasion of privacy but it would be violating for you to report it against her wishes. She is an adult and she made her decision. "
279,"I’ve been in almost the same situation, finding out my partner had contacted sex workers and was speaking to many women. Some he had met in person, some he even took on vacation, some he only chatted with, etc. I thought we had a great life and sex life together as well.

This is the most important thing to remember: the names and faces of those women DO NOT MATTER. This has nothing to do with them, this is between your husband and you. Stop searching for more (I know you are, I was as well) it’s not going to make you feel better... you don’t need to know anything more than you already do. Those fine details do not make you feel better.

With that being said, I would suggest you ask him to leave for a month or so. Gather your thoughts so you are not rushed. Are these things you can work out and how does that start? Are these things you can forgive truly and how long would that take? Are these things that will disrupt your sons life and make it harder for you to parent? Take some deep breaths and start writing down your thoughts. Start there.

Take that month and really do some soul searching. For me I found that I was able to take the steps to try to work the relationship out and set down boundaries. That worked for a year or so, and then I found out he had just become more sneaky and deceitful. There were tears and screams and broken glass, it was worse than first finding out. 

It’s been almost 10 years and I have learned a lot about our relationship thru introspection and intense therapy. He had an addiction. He had a need to be constantly praised and adored by whoever he could find, sex workers or co workers or neighbors, he didn’t care he just needed to be loved. It had nothing to do with me and I can tell you it has NOTHING to do with YOU. He is the one that is sick and has a problem. 

I will also say this, from past relationship experience and from experience being a stripper for 7 years, he most likely had sex with all of those women. Men like him may start off just communicating but they get bored fast. 

He jeopardized your health and the health of your son for his need for instant and sexual gratification. Beyond the lies, please see this and remember it.  The significantly large amount of time and money he used to live this other life was time and money that he took away from you and your son. 

Let me know if you have questions. This is a huge life twist and I’m truly sorry anyone else has to experience it. "
280,"If she tries to bring it up, simply say something like, ""Mom, we've talked about this before.  I was 18 when we got together.  I won't tolerate you telling these terrible lies about [boyfriend] anymore, and if you won't stop, I'm going to leave.""  Then, if she doesn't stop...leave."
281,"I mean, being sheltered doesn't mean she lacks common sense. 

You never confirmed you'd be picking her up. You said you could see what you could do provided they gave you more details about when to pick her up. It was on her to tell you ""could you pick me up at x hour at the airport on y day?"", but they failed to give you more details and expected you to figure it out on your own. If your girlfriend gives you shit about not asking enough, you can always tell her that you were doing her sister a favor. The one who was interested in being picked up from the airport was her sister, so she was the one who should've updated you accordingly. Plus, she should've had a Plan B anyway. It's illogical and entitled that with services like Lyft or Uber, she couldn't figure out how to leave the airport and stayed there for 4 hours. "
282,"Also, I'd suggest looking in to why you're clinging to this grudge. Your brother actively is trying to fix the situation, but what have you done on your part to move forward? It seems like an unreasonably long time to hold on to so much anger."
283,"If my husband texted any of my friends anything even remotely close to that, I would be livid to later find out he’s a cheating creep and that my friend didn’t tell me when it happened. If he texted you like that, he’s most certainly having similar exchanges with other females, probably women his wife knows and doesn’t know. You should show her, screen shots and all. Save her. "
284,"You don't say how old the two of you are, but I'm going to guess you are both pretty young.

Don't be friends with this guy. You need a formal custody agreement and a polite, emotionally-distant coparenting relationship, because that's going to save you a lot of heartbreak. He doesn't want to be with you. I think he's playacting when he's with you and your son, and that's all it is. He probably likes the female attention--not just from you, but from the women around making much of him for acting like a good dad.

This dude is not going to be your happy ever after. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can move on and live your life."
285,"&gt;  Why didn't the sister contact you ... 

Right???  

This is a sign of some weird dynamic here. Is the sister the Golden Child or something? Is the rest if the family infantilizing her because it makes them feel awesome, or to distract themselves from some other unhealthy situation? 

At very least, none of them are capable of straightforward communication, which is quite the red flag right there. "
286,"Well, if your best friend is looking for a woman who doesn’t have normal bodily functions, he’s going to be single for a long time."

288,"He was 28 dating a 19 year old, yeah he had maturity issues and was looking for someone who wouldn’t hold him accountable for them. And if you let this pass, you’ll prove him right, as he won’t be held accountable for almost letting someone he loves dies because he still isn’t mature.

Why are you marrying him? You think he’s a lazy ass, don’t seem to respect him, and he barely seems to care about you and you almost lost your life because of it. 

Why settle for an immature 30+ year old at 22 and know your life is on the line when you could date..: literally anyone else and probably do better? "
289,Yeah. Deffinitely right. Thank you.
290,"... aaaaand this is what happens when young girls are taught that good looks make them special and negate the need to cultivate their personalities.

If you're dissatisfied with the direction your life has taken because you couldn't coast on your appearance forever, figure out what you want to be different and take action. Go back to school. Take up some new hobbies. Start working out. Do something to get yourself out of stagnation.

Also, I've gotta add that your bitterness that your sister seems to have surpassed you in life makes me wonder how much of your identity is wrapped up in being somehow superior to her by dint of being ""the pretty one."" Some introspection on why you still need her to fulfill the role you've cast her in would be beneficial. "

Consider:

&gt;  I've begged her to put him in the hospital where someone can contain him, but she worries that the facilities there would be damaging to him and keeps begging me to return home.

No shit! Hence, you've really done all that you can do right there. They won't do what is necessary, and the matter is more about your parents' poor judgement than your brother. If you showed up, you still wouldn't be in command, and at a minimum, only a witness to the mess that shall unfold. Hence, there's no purpose in going to the aide of your parents. Ultimately, they won't accept it."

So he works from 9 - 5 just like a ton of people with a full time job.   He is not a workaholic, he's just telling you that because he has been able to successfully manipulate you with his ""busy"" schedule.

&gt;I’m a senior in college

If you have more free time than him, it's OK for you to pick up more of the chores but he should have a willingness to do a share of them and it should be balanced.  Based on your post I don't expect your BF to change once you have a full time job and are also working 9 - 5.

&gt;I pay rent!

How are the rest of the finances?  Do you split them 50/50?  If so then his share of the chores should be closer to 50/50 as well.

&gt;The sex sucks too. He doesn’t touch me, just tells me what to do to him.

This alone is a very good reason to break up.  Why would you sign up for bad sex for the rest of your life?"
296,"I would ask your friend what they're going to wear. And base it off of that. New clothes shouldn't be necessary. 

It would be nice to bring the host/friend a gift, even if it's something simple like some chocolates, but you don't have to bring everyone a gift.

As for drinking you don't have to explain why you don't want to drink it, 'no thanks' is good enough. And for clearing plates/whatever else might pop up just ask, like 'where would you like me to put my plate?' "
297,Well. Next time they should stay in a hotel. 
298,"So he does not pressure you about this - it comes up off-hand, occasionally brought up directly by you - and while he admits his interest in a threesome is still there, he accepts that you will never indulge the request. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like when you tell him how much the idea disgusts you, you are hoping that your revulsion will convince him how horrible a threesome really is. You do not want him to just accept he will never have a threesome with you (he has), you want him to completely change his mind on the matter and share your disgust, perhaps even becoming a bit contrite that he ever wanted it. This is a situation where you both recognize you have differing attitudes toward sex, your boyfriend accepts your attitude, while you do not accept his.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want this relationship to work, you would need to actually accept that your boyfriend has a completely different attitude toward sex and love. Accept that he would, in a hypothetical, enjoy a threesome. The key is that despite his interest in one, he understands and is ok with not having a threesome, and through his actions is remaining within the boundaries of your relationship. You cannot police his thoughts and beliefs. When someone's core values are distasteful of offensive to you, part of accepting that person might mean breaking up with them. "
299,They're actively trying to get pregnant but she doesn't work and he doesn't make much money? Wow. 
300,Or that she was embarrassed by the other girls' actions and worried it would reflect badly on her with the friend she just asked a $700 favor of.
301,"That's a much more mature response than what I was thinking, which was to point out to MIL that she shouldn't be in the photo either.  Why? Because it's a *Smith* family photo and she doesn't have any Smith genes. She just married in the same as the daughters-in-law."
302,"You are more patient than I am because I would have kicked him to the curb outside the bar when he chose to go with her. That's ridiculous, especially after the way she acted the whole night. 

She is purposefully trying to sabotage stuff and make you jealous, and he is allowing her bad behaviour. That is a lot for a short relationship, but since you have known him for 2 years I guess I would just sit him down and explain all of her behavior in the bathroom if he doesnt fully understand it and then ask him how he thinks this situation should be handled and his thoughts on his friendship with her."
303,"The only think I know for sure is when he eventually does say it you have to say ""right back at ya' """
304,"One thing to keep in mind - if you do decide to somehow take on this burden, get a full accounting of the debt before you take it on. How much was taken out when and why; records of payments of those amounts to the school or to you. 

You don’t want to take on any debt that wasn’t used to pay for your education, even if it’s labeled “student loan” "
305,"&gt; Apparently I was once a truly horrendous kisser!

This is hilarious and the fact that she feels comfortable enough to tease you about it and you are secure enough to laugh it off bodes very well for your future."
306,It's not that heavy. Just stop trying. Don't reach out first. Be normal in person. 
307,"I just want to point out that sometimes not working just because you won't be making a net gain in money isn't always a good choice. Just because you might not be making monetary gain doesn't mean it isn't valuable to stay working. If you lose a decade of work experience and something happens like divorce, death, sickness, or your partner losing their job you have very little market value in the way of finding a career. 

Just something to consider."
308,"Your boyfriend doesn't want a girlfriend.

He wants a mommy he can fuck.

And it sounds like he's awful at that, too.

If you're more mature at 23 than he is at 30, this isn't going to change. You're only going to grow while he continues to rot."
309,"This is exactly it.

In my situation it cut my self confidence down SO MUCH.  I felt like I obviously wasn’t enough, when I was devoted to him.

I gave up everything in my life to be with him, and then was left high and dry.  

Looking back I was young and stupid.  It was a very unhealthy relationship and I allowed him to completely control my life.

It was such a punch in the gut it took me over a year to start feeling better.  I have been married now for almost 6 years and have 2 awesome kids.  

My husband is the most kind and loving man I have ever met.  He has never done anything but support me.  I love him with my whole heart and trust him with my life.

But my self confidence still suffers to this day.  Sometimes it is crippling.  My husband has never called me anything but gorgeous, but I still have feelings every now and again about not being enough.

OP it had nothing to do with her love for him or you.  It’s the pain of rejection and betrayal that hurts so very much."
310,"This is my view on it too. As long as she was *playing at* enjoying with being with other men, it was fine. Now that she *actually* likes it, he feels like he's lost control and is flailing to gain the control back."
311,"3 years isn't that big of an age gap?

Edit, I meant, I don't understand why the mom is saying it is an age gap. Am genuinely confuzzled."
312,"&gt;I've also emailed the above to our management company but I don't think there's anything they can do.

They most certainly can.  You are paying rent to them and are being deprived of peaceful enjoyment of your living arrangements.  Your neighbor does not have the right to harass you and you need to file a complaint each and every time she does."

314,"Your boyfriend hitting walls and throwing things was a test. He was testing to see if you accepted that level of violence. You passed the test. So, he moved on to the next test, which is punching you in the face. He's waiting to see if you pass that test too, so he knows he can have you completely under his control for the rest of your life. The violence wont stop. The violence is part of his relationship towards you. You've defined him by his temper. That's exactly how he wants it. He wants you to be scared of him, forever, so he can control you.

The flowers are an obvious manipulation, and your gut is screaming at you to notice.

Your sister would probably love your help taking care of the baby. Call her immediately and tell her what's happening, and ask for help.

I'm sorry about your parents, too, they sound even more awful, and I'm sorry you haven't had those kinds of positive people in your life that you deserve.

Your boyfriend may have saved you from your parents, but your boyfriend is just as violent. He is just waiting to make sure you were willing to accept his violence before committing to it."
315,"&gt; She gets a little self conscious of the way she looks though, so I suggested running   
&gt;  
&gt; She took a bit of coaxing but finally agreed.   
&gt;  
&gt; I stopped running and doubled over, tried to contain my laughter 

Yes, your girlfriend was running like an idiot. But it doesn't change the fact that she was already self-conscious, and once she *finally* got the courage to give it a try, you openly *laughed* at her. So now she's going to be a LOT self-conscious. 

You need to openly, sincerely and unabashedly apologise for laughing at her. Then, once she's willing to talk to you again, you can say something benign like, ""I've never seen anyone run that way in real life. It's not a practical way of running; if you were to trip, you'd fall flat on your face without your arms to break your fall. Let me show you a better technique."" 

Still, the poor thing. No matter how much of an idiot you're being, no one wants to be laughed at. "
316,"Oh boy this would be grounds for me asking her to not be my bridesmaid anymore. Your bachelorette party is NOT the place for her to have a mid twenties crisis about not wanting to go out anymore. She should've sucked it up and fulfilled her promise. I'm sorry this happened to you! I would send her a message telling her how you feel about the situation. If she apologizes, then do what you think is right with the apology. If she doubles down, then I would tell her she can come to the wedding as a guest, but you clearly can't depend on her on your special day so she is no longer a bridesmaid. Also, if she doesn't want to ""party"" she can stay home on the day of the wedding and miss what's supposed to be the best party of your life!"
317,I’ll come over here by you. I completely agree. It’s not okay to surprise people with an extra $45k debt. 
318,"Uhh yeah....add 2 more zeros (at least) to that price for a Tiffany ring of that size

Edit: But for real advice: you need to confront him and ask him while he lied, especially when you said you didn’t care about the price. If you’re going to get married there needs to be honesty and open communication. 

Edit: also it would be in a Tiffany blue box..dude *really* didn’t do his research lmao."
319,4 hrs? She couldn't have caught a Lyft?
320,"He’s the one who decided to ruin what should be a fun festive time, over a $10 purchase.  $10.  This is what he’s willing to go to an extreme battle over.  That tells me you will likely never be able to relax with this person without fear of constant meltdowns.  For him to grab the purchase and return it is not only undermining you and treating you like a child but it is also controlling bullying behavior.  Then he wants to come demanding an apology (ie keep fighting) when you are trying to just cool off and be left alone.  His behavior is skirting around the edges of emotional abuse."
321,"What’s probably going through her head is that she’s a consolation prize because this other girl was dating someone else. 

What you need to do is reframe the narrative: That *you* think it’s funny and cute and *clearly* someone is looking out for you if you ended up with this amazing woman. "
322,"Yeah, side-eye to this dude because it seems like he's deliberately gone for someone a lot younger he can mold into being a housewife."
323,You're holding an unreasonable grudge. Accidents happen. He wasn't a man; he was a 13 year old kid doing a prank. You need to mature and apologize to him.
324,He is lying for sure. It might be because of his anxiety or maybe because of something else. I would probably just forget about him and move on. Something definitely isn’t right here
325,"&gt;Bonus: you'll be showing your wife why the man she married is a better man than the asshole who cheated, too.

This part is amazing and so true.  She will know that and it will touch her heart in a way she won't forget. "
326,"&gt; Am I crazy, or should she have texted to tell me she was staying out and that she was ok?

&gt;I got drunk texts at 10:15 pm - presumably after the main event, but the party/drinking still going — where she told me she was crying and losing it and I tried to console her.

It sounds like she did text you and she was not OK.  Why was she crying and losing it?  Did she have a safe way home?   I think at that point I would have offered to come and get her.  "
327,"Listen here girl, you're my friend!
But I don't wanna see what's comin' out ya end.  If there's something you must push out ya tush then feel free to make it rain but FLUSH IT DOWN THE DRAIN!
 "
328,"You're a doormat. Your roommate is a user. In her eyes, this is a perfect match. She's 27 and unless she's got some learning or communication disability, then she's know she's taking liberates and is banking on you being too much of a wet blanket to stop her doing so. 

Practical remedies - just store most of the items in your room. Get a shower caddy for your toiletries that you can bring to bathroom when you shower and back to your room when you're done. Get a lock for your room/cabinets/cupboards.

The next thing you need to work on is being more assertive. You are a bit of a pushover. 

&gt; when her shampoo ran out she just moved on to mine, so I just went to the store and got the biggest cheapest shampoo/conditioner I could find and handed to her. 

Why on earth are you doing this?  You are rewarding her bad behaviour by buying her stuff?!?!?! She knows she can use your stuff with no bad consequences because they worst you will do is buy her stuff?!?!? Bizarre.

You're really wishy-washy about the borrowing rules. You've told her she can use your stuff providing :-

\- she asks your 1st.

\- she returns / replaces it.

\- etc, etc.

She is not honoring these rules so you need to remove these privileges immediately. Just tell her in no certain terms that from now on she cannot use your stuff. No ifs, no buts. 

Seriously, you're too concerned about being nice and 'not being the bad guy' but she's not giving you that same consideration. She does not care about being nice when she uses the last of your expensive face mask? So why do you care about giving her more courtesy than she extends you?

&amp;#x200B;"
329,"&gt; Edit: I JUST REALIZED HE'S THIRTY. WTF.

That with this...

&gt;  He knows I was sheltered growing up so he has helped me learn basic life skills, yet I can’t help but feel he’s taking advantage of this situation.

Sounds like another case of wife grooming. I mean his knee is so bad he can't get his own freaking food, but not bad enough that he can't spend 2 hours working out. This guy hit the jackpot. He found some sheltered 20 year old girl and has been slowly molding her into his own personal mother/maid. "
330,"We  celebrate Christmas at home &amp; have shut this down by saying ""We're starting our own family and intend to create our own traditions just as you did."" They sputter, they mutter, but they don't have a comeback. 17 years later it still works. "
331,"Cruel men have a habit of going for younger women because they’re more likely to put up with awful behaviors. If you read the forum you’ll see a lot of 20 year old women with men in their 40s-50s ending up as house maids who are treated absolutely detestfully.

I don’t know if she is using him for money, but I don’t think it’s fair to assume. 

You should absolutely take care of your own safety first, but I would try to reach out to her and tell her no partner should treat her that way. And if you don’t think your dad would ever hurt you, ask him if he would want a man treating you the way he treats her."
332,"It's ""good"" that this is happening before you get married and I would caution you about moving forward before hashing this out. 

The kids thing is important, but so are finances. Does he never want to move away from the high COL city you're in? Do you actually *want* to be a SAHM? Will he be a supportive partner to you as a SAHM? 

These are deal breakers if you both can't compromise on them without resentment. Since you're engaged, the time for these big, serious conversations is now and IMO he should already be thinking of you two as his main family and everyone else as secondary, or non-immediate family. It doesn't sound like he is though?"
333,"Glad you communicated with him and got things mostly sorted. Though I'm a bit confused by:

&gt; he thinks she is a mess and super annoying when she is drunk and doesn't want to be around her when she is drinking.

How does this statement jive with the fact that he made a decision to follow drunk-her in order to hang out with her at that dude's house?

But yes, I'm glad to see active communication like this. That was the only bit that gave me pause.

E: word"
334,"Yeah I was drafting what to reply to him, but I think this is a good point. I thought posting in this sub would be a dumpster fire but it's been pretty helpful. I generally steer clear of drama so I wasn't sure how to handle this. My conversation was with my sister anyways and not him. It's up to her to deal with him since he's her guest in our extended family."
335,"Okay. You don't want to block her. You do want her to stop calling your cell with her child, and you want to still be available to take emergency calls about your sick mom. This is the main problem, right?

I have a really, really simple solve here. You might not like it but it will work. This is one of those rare r/relationships situations where there actually is a potentially conflict-free solution here.

Change your number.

Change your number *today.*

Make sure your mom's emergency contacts are up to date, and maybe slow-roll (or use another texting / calling app) to friends--I'd be especially careful with mutual friends who might give her your number. edit: if I were you I'd change the number and then try to get on a messaging app that lets you text phone numbers from a place that isn't your phone number, just to keep things locked down.

If anyone asks, you were getting a lot of spam calls, which isn't even a lie.

Change your number and be free, my dude."
336,"If she has an option to put him into care or into the hospital, but is refusing to do it out of concern for him then this is NOT your responsibility. The reality is that your parents are not capable of dealing with this anymore and it is actually more detrimental to everyone involved to keep him in a situation that is unsafe for everyone. Having you there is going to do absolutely nothing to help. 

Your mom needs to stop being in denial. It's harming them, your brother, and you. As someone who works with adults with disabilities, I'm actually of the opinion your mother and father are the ones being selfish here, even if it is coming from a place of love."
337,"From what you've written, he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you, and he doesn't want to be a father.

Which sucks. I'm sorry this is happening to you.

But you need to make some decisions now. 

Do you want to keep the baby?

If you keep it, you'll be a single mother. And I don't think you'll be able to count on the father for much in the way of child support.

So could you afford to support yourself and a child? Do you have family in your home country who would be willing/able to support you? Or do you have enough savings that you wouldn't need to work? Or would you be able to find a job/afford childcare? What would you do if the child was severely disabled, or had serious medical issues? Do you have the money you'd need to help them? (or does your country have socialized medical care?)

If you don't want a baby right now, or couldn't afford to support one, then you have other options available.

Abortion would be the easiest option. If you'd like to choose it, make sure you move fast so that you don't run out of time.

If you don't like that idea, you could look at adopting the baby out.  Make sure you consider all of the possible ramifications of that kind of choice before you go there - it's not necessarily an easy option. 

Would you be open with your family about it? Would they support you about it? What would you do if you suffered a medical injury during the birth and weren't able to work afterwards - would you be able to support yourself?

There's no right or wrong answers here.

You need to think about your options and make the choice that will be right for you.

You can't rely on your boyfriend, so make your decision without considering him."
338,Also you literally *live together* and were three minutes from your home. He didn't have to go out of his way AT ALL to get you home safe. I can't believe someone would be so selfish and thoughtless.
339,"I would go so far as to tell them that you hope they *don't* give her money, and hope that they stop all further communication with her, because of the potential it has to jeopardize your relationship with them.  And make sure they know that she didn't ask on your behalf, you were wholly unaware, and she didn't give you any money she may have gotten from them.  

I honestly don't know if i would be able to continue to have a relationship with my mother after that. "
340,"And to add to that he knew his dad's death was coming, he had time to prepare for it, while the gf's dad died out of the blue. She had no way to prepare for it."
341,"This sounds like genuine mental illness. I’d do a bit of research on paranoia, and bring it up to your parents in a spirit of concern for your sister. It’s uncomfortable for you now, but if she is slipping into schizophrenia, that’s far, far beyond discomfort. Treatment ASAP is crucial,

Hopefully your parents have rational beliefs about mental health and resources to get her checked. They may also know more about any family history of it."
342,You missed a golden opportunity to ask your MIL what makes her so sure that the baby is her son’s and not some rando from the orgy
343,Those are not the actions of a 36 years old man. Seriously ffs. 
344,"I think it’s very worrying if you plan to have children with this guy. You may or may not have children that turn out to be gay.  But let’s say you have boys, will be police their preferences and interests to make sure they’re not “gay”?  Will be ban them from doing say drama or art because it’s not “manly” enough. Will be encourage them to become sexist arseholes that treat women badly or as inferior?

What if you have daughters, will be only like them if they conform to a delicate stereotype? What if they prefer short hair and want to be a truck driver? What if she has an active sex life? 

Homophobia of has very close ties with sexism.  I know you love him, but look closely at your relationship. Is it equal or does he expect you to do all the emotional heavy lifting?  The expectations of the woman doing all the “wifework” get worse once you have children.

He’s told you who he is.  Believe him."
345,"I think we all have a point in our teenage years where we feel the crushing weight of the world and realize that school isn’t forever and we’re going to have to become a functioning adult. If your son is a late bloomer, it wouldn’t surprise me if these revelations are happening to him later than maybe what his friends experienced (17 to 21 I’d say for most is when this happens).

Right now, I think your son would benefit from some counseling and from you guys talking more. If you haven’t been talking a lot about life up until this point is phase it in slowly, or else you might come off as prying and scare his away. But feeling like he has someone to talk to and to share experiences with I’m sure would benefit him."

Based on how the story is presented, it seems like you've always been fully on Christian's side and haven't taken what your GF feels seriously. That's just how it seems to me, and I know a lot of people here don't agree with this, but I really think putting things into her perspective would be helpful, at least a little.

354,"&gt; Ripping up the card is a really visceral reaction.

Yeah, that was an action with a lot of aggression behind it. "
355,"Okay, so:

""Basically, over the course of these 2 years this means I've developed and refined strategies of approaching her when I want to get her in the mood."" 

Here you're saying that you have strategies that you intend to lead to sex.

""Ways to make sure I don't come onto her too strong, so that I'm not interpreted as expecting anything sexual.""   
Um... you are expecting something sexual.  You specifically said that this is a strategy you developed in the hopes of getting her in the mood to have sex.  You just don't want her to know that's what you're doing.

""You see, I can't just spoon her in the sofa and put a hand on her hip, she says my intentions are too obvious and she shuts down.""

Unfortunately for you, your girlfriend has caught on to your strategies where you don't want her to think you want sex until you've gotten her in the mood for sex, which you want.  And now you feel gaslit because she knows what you do when you want sex and you didn't want her to figure it out.  


Look, you're probably just sexually incompatible.  That's no one's fault.  But it's not really okay to use innocuous touching as a stealth slide-in to sex and then get mad when your girlfriend starts interpreting innocuous touching as a stealth slide-in to sex.  Try using your words instead of playing games and trying to manipulate your girlfriend into doing something she's not in the mood to do."
356,Totally blame the 45 year old. What sort of predator do you need to be to want to date a *child* less than half your age?

359,"The level of cruelty she displayed towards your friend is truly disturbing. I don’t think you should try to mend fences at all. This isn’t an issue you should expect James to forgive of a girlfriend of only six months. After such a short period of time dating, I think this is a really strong data point that indicates your girlfriend has serious problems. Being rude to people in the service industry is a really bad sign to begin with, but now that you’ve seen how relentlessly cruel she can be to a person you deeply care for, I’d start to worry that her lack of capacity for empathy could be a real deal-breaker. I’d make sure you do everything within your power to make sure your loyal friend of 17 years knows that you’re on his side in this matter and you’re not trying to make any excuses for your girlfriend’s truly inexcusable behavior."

He's projecting on you because it specifically reminds him of a time he couldn't reach an ex-SO and that person WAS cheating on him. It made him feel helpless (explaining how he felt not that it was appropriate), and it's sort of like a previously abused person/animal that recoils to any sudden movements or perceived threatening gestures - He recoiled. Again, not saying it's appropriate, but I understand it. Or he could just be a controlling dude. lol .... My guess is you'll never be able to make him feel ""safe"" enough if he hasn't put in necessary steps to work through his past. "
368,"""A series of unusual events"" = ""I slept through my phone buzzing.""

Your boyfriend is acting like a crazy person."
369,"If my mom yelled at my partner, I would lose my shit on her. She's not *his* mom and it is not her place, it would be extremely disrespectful for her to speak that way to him.

I'm worried your girlfriend is 

- not listening to your version of things
- not believing you
- picking her family's side over yours
- allowing her mother to misbehave towards you

You and your emotional well-being should be her priority in this scenario, not anyone else's. It's not right, and a good indication of the social standing you have in this family. They're treating you like a servant.

Honestly, I found it a little sketch to begin with that she voluntold you to pick up her sister. You couldn't realistically refuse once she'd suggested you in a group chat. So you're stuck doing it, and then punished for not doing it. You're losing out twice and they're all ganging up on you. Gross!"
370,"&gt;Protect you and the kids. Went through this almost exact same thing. Stayed with him. He did it again, and again and again. Finally divorced him and I’ve never been happier.

Been through this exact situation from 2011 - 2017. Worst decade of my life going back and forth on this exact broken promise.

I don't have regrets because my life is better than ever since I left him, but I'd tell OP to run NOW, just as fast as I would tell 2011 AuntieWhisper the same thing."
371,"Yes. This summarizes my feelings pretty well, thank you."
372,"This is simultaneously her being insecure or paranoid, **and** you being unreasonable. Because you could just repeatedly communicate to her that her behaviour is annoying and makes you feel she doesn't trust you. Instead you're saying ""don't worry about it"" and tilting your phone away, which of course looks sketchy. If you don't have a problem with her knowing who you're talking to, just tell her and stop playing games. But **also** tell her that while you're happy to tell her, you're getting more and more sick of not being trusted, and if she keeps asking over and over again you may have to re-evaluate the relationship. Her trust issues are hers to work on, but at the moment you're not doing yourself any favours either."
373,"Your mom is not a good mother. She's not even a good person.

So never believe her if she says she's looking out for you. Because she's really not.

It's not going to be easy, but you'll be out of there in 3 years. So hold on as best you can.

Grey rock her. Become the most boring teenager in the world. Hide everything about your true self as much as you can.

Maybe take a leaf out of the book of some celebrities - try to always wear the same clothes at home. If you're always wearing the same thing, her pics of you will have less impact on social media (it'll always look like the same set of photos).

If you manage to make new friends at school (or elsewhere)? She can never find out about them. Not their names. Not that they're your friends. Nothing.

As soon as you're old enough to get a job, get one. Even if you have to hide that from her too.

As soon as you're old enough to get your own bank account (if you don't already have one), get one. Make sure it's in a bank that your mother doesn't use.

Until then, try to hide your cash savings as best you can. Think outside the box when considering locations, and also consider that it can't be somewhere that she could see you putting money in/taking money out.

As soon as you turn 18, look for full time work. Only go on to tertiary study if you have a full scholarship (and are confident that you could cover your other expenses with a part-time job).

Otherwise, your main priority should be survival to start with. Find a cheap place and move out. Even if you can only afford a tiny room in a house with 8 other people.

Once you're out, report her to the police about the identity theft. Start the process for clearing your name.

Then... start living your life.

Keep saving money. Keep gaining work experience. 

Look for better jobs. Maybe get some qualifications (if you haven't already).

Start thinking about what you want your life to be.

Would you like to live in a houseboat? Travel the world? Have a bunch of pets? Have a bunch of kids? Raise emus? Find a partner? Make a bunch of awesome friends that are into the same hobbies that you are?

It's your life, so make it a good one.

And you'll never have to see your mother again if you don't want to. "
374,Stop making plans with her and make plans with people who respect you and your time instead. 
375,"Don't talk to them directly. If it really is an abusive or unhealthy situation then you should let child services know, they will investigate and determine if the kid is in danger or not. If the kid is not in danger then I think you stay out of it. "

377,omg just break up. it shouldn't be this difficult.
378,"&gt; my dad is unnecessarily over dramatic.

That's not being ""overly dramatic."" That's being abusive. 

It doesn't sound like this kind of behavior from your dad is a one time thing. He seems to have a need to control and debase you. You understand that this kind of behavior isn't normal or healthy, right?

Time for a visit to /r/raisedbynarcissists ..."
379,"I would definitely say dramatic and short-tempered more than anything clinical impacting upon her actions. She's in fine physical and mental health, so isn't taking/not taking anything that could make her paranoid or react like this. My concern is that she's trying to paint my father as a big bad wolf for some reason, though I would be shocked if she actually left him."
380,"&gt; He guilt trips me by saying “no boyfriends call their girlfriends every day after work. You are lucky!” 


?? Does he... does he *know* any other boyfriends?


Look, all I can say is that being go with the flow has ended with you being in a situation where you're completely taken advantage of. Literally nothing in your post is something I would tolerate. That's not to say you need the same boundaries anyone else has, but it is to say that having no boundaries has gotten you into a pretty toxic situation. "
381,"He’s not a functioning adult. You didn’t notice this because you were long distance for most of your relationship. If you hope he will eventually become an adult, you will probably end up disappointed."
382,"What is your mom's game plan? You come home and stay with your brother. Worst case, it doesn't work and he still goes into violent rages and hurts you. Best case, he does get better but now his crutch is you. What are you supposed to do long term? Live at home and care for your brother full time? It's like the game of, ""and then what,"" and it doesn't get better. 

Your brother needs professional counseling and for the counselor to come up with some viable options for him. You putting your life on hold indefinitely for this is not an acceptable request for your mother to ask.

Don't be upset with your mother b/c she doesn't know any better. She thinks it is the best thing, but it clearly is not. 

I'm sorry you are in this situation. Good luck with it. "
383,"Your wife has just been avoiding telling you she does not want a kid.  Having one would destroy any sporting goals she has and it sounds like the future she wants is those goals. Not a child. 
You are hardly running out of time but you might do well to have a serious conversation with her and ask for a final definitive answer. With what you have said I very much doubt she will be for it. But finally knowing for sure would be something at least. "
384,"You need to be honest with your husband and make it clear that he needs to set boundaries with his mom for your marriage. Honestly, it's on your husband to make sure that his parents respect you. What's the plan to get your own place?"
385,"&gt;I got drunk texts at 10:15 pm - presumably after the main event, but the party/drinking still going — where she told me she was crying and losing it and I tried to console her.   
&gt;  
&gt;Am I crazy, or should she have texted to tell me she was staying out and that she was ok?

Did you actually read what you wrote before you posted it?  Your GF texted you at 10:15 to tell you she was still out and distinctly NOT okay.

Seriously: I'm still trying to wrap my head around the concept that your partner of three years texted you at 10:15 telling you she was crying and losing it, and you didn't offer to just go and get her, and instead just tried to console her by text.  How hard would it have been to go get her, or even to offer to pay for an Uber/Lyft to go get her if you couldn't drive for some reason?

I really hope she's okay.  And I really hope that you do not blame her for any possible ""cheating"" when she reached out to you for help and support and you didn't apparently see the need to go and get her while she was obviously impaired."
386,"Yeah...it may have been a prank but it’s not like he took a bat to you and intentionally broke bones. Unless I’m missing something, I’m not sure I follow the justification for any of this.

When I was about the same age I went bike riding with my dad, was kinda goofing around and accidentally clipped him. He totally ate the pavement and still has scars on his knees and hands from the crash.

My dad never asked for an apology and never mentioned it again. Ever. Not exactly the same, but I’m really grateful I was given that grace, and think about what maturity it took for my dad to handle it that way all the time.

Obviously you can’t just forget, but you mention that he “was a real asshole”, even though this injury sounds way more like things going really bad with kids goofing around. Hell, my wife and I scare each other just to be funny sometimes. It sounds like this has way more to do with other things than this incident...just generalized resentment towards your sibling, that has all become fixated on this event.

All I can say is yeah, maybe you’re getting back at him a little by making him feel like shit for things that happened a childhood ago, but you’re probably hurting yourself more by holding onto all this resentment. "

Okay, wtf. Not appropriate at all. It is frankly pretty creepy."
390,"You’re not a bad person. You’re very young, and if you don’t take the chance to launch your own life, you’ll be stuck. I work in a nursing home, and we had a 21 year old that was primary caregiver for a family member because no one else would, she dropped out of high school, didn’t have time to date, and only left home to go to the grocery store. Unfortunately when her family member came to the nursing home for just a few months, she realized what was going on and how badly she and her family member were being treated, and she refused to be the person to take her back home. Her family made a huge deal about how horrible she was and etc, but she had been doing this for YEARS with no support, and she didn’t give in. The rest of the family pitched in and took the lady home, expecting the girl to take back over once they got home, but she refused, and told family she would call APS if they didn’t do right by the lady. After about 20 days or so, they moved the lady back into the nursing home, it was really the right move, she needed more care than one person could provide."
391,"ONLY if you're 100% convinced saying this won't put you in danger, OP."
392,"Uhh if I were you I'd be worrying about whether she's safe and okay, rather than making insinuations about her male coworkers."
393,"Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I'm still weirded out after going through it because I could never do that sort of stuff to a family member and be so unapologetic about. 

I'm sorry about your experience. I hope you've found your own peace and comfort with people that you enjoy. "
394,clearly the only correct response here
395,"So it’s okay for him to have female friends, but not okay for you to have male friends?

Just because he’s never presented himself this way before doesn’t mean that this isn’t the way that he actually is. Abusers often mask their true behavior as to lull you into a sense of security.

Be very grateful that he revealed this before you married him. Break up with this insecure loser. He doesn’t respect you."
396,"I do this all the time and it's so annoying, I catch myself after the conversation and every time I'm like why am I such an idiot.

For me it comes from being nervous that I dont know enough"
397,"Yes, please do this. It's very worrying that he also found out about where she was going on vacation from other people. There is no shame in a breakup and for OP's own safety, she should really inform people that they are no longer together. I can't imagine how awkward that was to have him show up at her workplace on her birthday, let along the vacation. What a sociopath."
398,"This isn't a guy thing.  This is the thing of a guy that you'll be explaining to Dateline one day.

&amp;#x200B;"
399,"I noted to the lack of mention about the girlfriend,  I would like to know if is because OP really doesn't have anything as nice to say about her."
400,"Listen to your managers.

You have changed your role, which means you are no longer responsible for your old role. Focus on your new one, and stop letting your old colleagues dump anything on you. If something from your old role gets passed to you, pass it on.

May seem harsh in one viewpoint, but I agree with Peter. Don't take on extra work you don't have to, even if it's work you used to do. The only way this would be justified is if you were paid more - ie. Being paid to train others in your old role.

Definitely stop babying them and focus on what you've now been set to do. If they mess up that's their problem.

Edit: I just reread about your colleagues having attitudes with you when you push back. Continue to push back. If they want to ""let it fuck up"" will it be your issue? Nope."
401,"It sounds like your mother needs serious help, and probably has for a long time.  While you are used to her outbursts, they are NOT normal.

Unfortunately, she has already decided what’s “true” in this situation and it will be hard (if not impossible) for her to change her mind without some sort of mental health intervention.

"
402,"I’m not an expert in this community, but my boyfriend and I have explored “the lifestyle” a bit. My understanding is it’s totally fine for a partner to decide to put the brakes on things at any moment. (Someone more experienced can clarify or disagree with me.)

That being said, he did not communicate his wishes to you properly. Clearly, something changed, and he doesn’t want to do it anymore, but rather than expressing why he feels that way, he’s just turning it into a problem with you. From what you’ve written, I don’t really see anything you’ve done “wrong.”

But in addition to that, I’m concerned with how he pressured you into cuckolding. Props to you for being open and interested in this, but it shouldn’t ever come from a place of obligation or pressure. My boyfriend has wanted to explore new things at times, and I’ve had to pump the brakes and say, “Babe, I’d love to, but right now, I’m not in the place for it.” And he’s been really respectful of that.

It sounds to me like a breakdown in communication in general. He has something going on, and for whatever reason, he’s lashing out at you instead of handling it maturely. Might be a good time for couple’s counseling, if he isn’t willing to even discuss this with you.

EDIT: After hearing others’ input, I’m a little torn. You started dating when you were so young that I’m not sure you’ve had a chance to really figure out what you want. And being that he was 31 and you were 20 (which I totally glossed over at first, sorry), it does seem predatory. I think couple’s therapy will shed light on the situation either way."
403,yeah that's super inappropriate. I still don't like how the boyfriend handled it but that card is way over the line of friendship when you're engaged to someone else. 
404,"you're too young to be putting up with this shit. You tried for a few years but this man doesn't respect you, doesn't trust you, and you can't rely on him! Honestly just pull this bandaid off and tell him this isn't going to work...You already know that's what you want

It's not usually *ALL* bad - but I think you two have been together long enough to know what you want in a relationship and if you two are compatible (you've made it clear that this is not what you want, and that you are not compatible) that's okay, nobody's fault - but don't waste any more of your time or energy "
405,"Tell your mother she CAN see everyone on Christmas Day. She can hang with your brother for awhile, then he leaves for a couple of hours so you and your wife can come over for a visit. Tell her that even if you were all there at the same time, it's not going to be like her vision of playing happy family. It will be awkward, because you'll need your brother to not come within 25 feet of your wife or to address her in any way, and for her safety you'll not leave her ""unguarded,"" so it's not like you're going to be sitting around the table chatting and laughing and making conversation. You'll be ""on alert"" the entire time, and your wife will probably be nervous and on edge. Also tell her that asking VICTIMS of sexual assault to ""bury the hatchet"" isn't ""being neutral,"" it's picking the side of the abuser. Tell her even using the phrase ""burying the hatchet"" in the case is so offensive, because it implies a mutual disagreement. It minimizes what really happened - your wife was assaulted and violated and has reason to fear for her safety while in your brother's presence. It wasn't some petty argument you both just need to ""get over."""
406,"&gt;After i said that he strangled me with both his hands.

**GET. OUT. NOW.**

Choking a partner is one of the biggest indicators that that person will go on to kill their partner.  

He's already clearly demonstrated that he has no problem hurting you.  

Please, please, please get out before it's too late.  Secretly make plans to leave, and do it.  Don't let him know you're leaving ahead of time. "
407,"Nope. No one ever brought it up again to me. But when I tell my gf this she asks me why I didn’t ask myself. 

Basically this: 

Me: no one updated me on any of it 

Her: so why didn’t you ask? 

Me: I did ask, I asked to be updated.

Her: but you should’ve realized she was flying in on that day and made sure someone was picking her up. And when you realized no one was then that’s your responsibility to do it yourself. You saw your name mentioned in the chat and you should’ve known that you were the only one close enough to pick her up.

Rinse and repeat"
408,"My interpretation of this story is that your wife has always been on the fence about having kids, maybe even more on the side of not wanting them.  When you were mid-20s that was ok, because she figured she would want them when she was older.  But, as life has gone on, she is finding out that there are other things that are more important to her and now she's gotten to 30 and still doesn't actually want kids, but also doesn't want to lose you, so she keeps coming up with new goals to do first.   
  
&gt; her buzz line is ""I'm sorry for being a shit wife"".  
  
That's a deflection.  Then you say ""No honey, you're the best wife I can image, it's ok, I want you to achieve your goals, we can wait longer."" and she gets her way for a little longer.  It's not sustainable.  If she doesn't want kids, she needs to be honest with you about that and let you go find someone who does.   "
409,"Do you want honest advice? Because as a woman your exact age with two older sisters, I'm having a hard time understanding this level of petty jealousy. I want nothing more than my sisters to find every happiness in this world, including a handsome husband, a stellar career and wonderful children to boot if they want to have a family.

It sounds like you've based your own happiness on being ""better"" than your sister - and really just better looking. That happiness should have matured as you got older, but instead you have recoiled to make excuses for yourself. You think ""life happened"" to you, and you're a victim whose perfect life has been ""stolen"" from you when you had a kid. You are 30 years old, girl. You are not dead. First you need to dig deeper and realize what will make you happy in life, and I really hope you get answers within you that it's more than being a pretty face with a great body. Maybe though, you're lacking in adventure and a career. You made that choice, and you can make new ones. Romance lacking? Talk to your husband. Need adventure? Make time to live the glamour life on occasion. Want a stellar career?Go to grad school. But seriously, you need help rewiring. Start with therapy."
410,"Shorter visits and stay at a hotel, if they're saying chores are non-negotiable then you simply teach them that you're capable of not negotiating as well. Don't let them treat you like you're still their dependent, either there's mutual respect or don't go at all imo. 

Sometimes you have to teach others to respect you by showing you respect yourself more than they do."
411,It sounds like he's cheating on you regularly enough that the woman wants you to find out.
412,"Next time she heads to the toilet, quickly say ""oh, name, I forgot to tell you, we always flush the toilet after we use it here.""

See how that goes.

Presumably she's nowhere near as awkward about toilet stuff as us Westerners are, otherwise she wouldn't be happy to leave it unflushed."
413,"Since your mom has been telling lies to solicit money, check on other ways she may have done this, for example opening credit cards or loans in your name. Get your credit reports and lock down your credit. Ask around your family and friends to see if anyone else has heard a sad tale of misfortune from her which required cash to fix. Has anything of value gone missing?

To stoop this low for money could indicate either a drug or gambling addiction; or could be plain old greed. Either way I'd consider she's burned all her chances for this lifetime and if you choose to have anything further to do with her it should be on a tough love basis."
414,"Jesus, are you the mental health fairy? I have really never heard these questions nor asked them of myself. 

Thanks. "
415,"My Dad is now a retired physician - he's always been a good looking man, and he treats the nurses and other hospital staff like human beings with brains and capabilities, so he is well, well loved by the staff.  Many nurses - not his direct staff, but ones who rotated on the floor where his patients tended to land - were hot for doctor.  He always shut them down, but it was an ongoing thing, especially in his 40's when he was all salt and pepper and catnip for this kind of nurse.

I was a candy-striper, and we set up my shift to be in the hospital on the evenings when my Dad was on-call, so he'd take me home.  Because my Dad was so well-loved, I really hated having our very unique family name on my name-tag - I could get trapped by people who were trying to suck-up to him through me (never worked).  I talked to the coordinator for the volunteer program but she said I really had to have my last name on there.  But, since this was the 80's, she said I could get a bunch of novelty pins and surround my name-tag on the pinafore (as long as they were all inoffensive, obvs).  That way, people were too busy looking at all my pins to get to my nametag about 95% of the time.

So one night, I'm in the elevator - I had to take something from the basement to the top floor, so I had situated myself into the back corner of the elevator, to let people get on and off as necessary.  At my Dad's floor, two nurses came on and started talking, after looking me over and deciding I was unimportant.  One of them was basically planning on how to get my Dad free of my Mom - the other nurse was like ""Come on - he's got a wife and kids, that's horrible.""  Other nurse pooh-poohed her and said, ""Oh I'm sure she's older - how hard could it be to steal him away?""

At that point I piped up from my corner and said, ""I don't know - my Mom's pretty tough.  I'm pretty sure she could take you.""  The shady nurse whipped her head around, sought out my nametag, blushed to the roots of her hair, turned around and firmly shut up.  The other nurse was snickering.  Any time I saw her on future shifts she would determinedly not look me in the face.

(I didn't tell my parents this story until I was in my 30's.  They both laughed REALLY hard.)

So, yeah - your husband needs to step up and deal with this NOW through HR.  I would suggest you come in to that meeting as well, to back up his responses and to affirm his annoyance.  This is beyond unprofessional, and verging on stalking behaviour."
416,"Yeah, hurt-&gt;lovebomb cycle is a thing with abusers."
417,"My mum was like this. Turns out she's delusional, and meds got her back to ok. Though there was a period last year when I noticed she was starting again. Luckily I answered her house phone one day - it was psychiatrist calling to check up how she was doing on the reduced meds they were trying. 
Soon put her right. Turns out my mum was not telling her doctor the truth 

It's really sad to see one's mum losing it, even slightly, and amazing to see the transformation medication can elicit. And how even a slight change in medication can have a deleterious effect.

I have to warn you though that it's a very painful endeavour to bring up and follow through with."
418,"OP, you really gotta wonder if this is the guy for you. He considers his family to be you, his kid and him, while you don't see the same. You're not wrong in feeling to be taken advantage of. If this guy was paying for his own kid and taking responsibility, you likely would've been feeling more 'family-esque', but you've been carrying a lot while he thinks you took on the job of providing for them. Also, why is your grandma's money his savings? The entitlement makes you incompatible.

Christmas and birthdays are rather predictable. Why hasn't this guy gotten a side job for a few weeks here and there over the year to provide for this? What kind of super NASA stuff is this guy studying that he can't do some sidegigs now and then?

A new year is here soon. Maybe consider if a fresh start would be a good thing for you. "

420,"The STD and pregnancy tests are a good idea, but know that pregnancy tests won't show positive for some time after sex (not sure about the exact timeline tbh). 

First off, I think that you need to talk with your husband first and make it clear his reaction could be harming his relationship with your daughter. He sounds like he is taking his concern and channeling it in an unproductive manner. 

I think it's time to have a serious conversation with your daughter about safe sex as well if you haven't already and if she is going to be sexually active, time to consider getting her on BC. Buying her a pack of condoms wouldn't hurt either. As much as you may not want your daughter to be having sex, you need to deal with reality and the reality is she is going to be having sex, so you need to make sure she doesn't get pregnant."

423,"lol well if somebody goes as far as explicitly TELLING you via a note, then this is **super** low stakes. If I were you, I'd even go as far as admitting that I'm clueless -- she'd probably find it endearing. 

You don't realize how ideal this situation is. You have so much leeway with respect to just being awkward and being a straight up dumbass. Few simple rules and you'll be fine: (1) DON'T be a jerk; and (2) Be a gentleman. "

425,"But......you told the MIL to let you know, which then she responded she would ask so and so, so SHE was the last one via the group chat to claim the temporary responsibility until she gave you the info.

Simple comparison:

“Would you deliver this important package?”
“Sure, where do I deliver it to?”
“Let me find out.”

“Why didn’t you deliver the package like you said you would?!!?!”

They’re cray."
426,"Hes not dismissing her at all though. In fact, he’s making excuses like “she’s just trying to be nice” when she’s asking him completely inappropriate questions and he’s still responding to her and engaging with her.

You haven’t described any behavior on his part to indicate that he wants it to stop. You wrote a super long post with a bunch of times he’s engaged in her inappropriate behavior/made excuses for it and literally not one time he told her to stop."

Most adults should know that you get out of a relationship what you put in. In this case, it sounds like he's still in a very selfish phase.

My advice is....stop making an effort. He doesn't understand it and it's not on you to teach him.

If he starts asking where the presents are for Christmas, birthday, Valentine's, etc, tell him they are in the same place yours are. 

This tactic will be a lot less stressful for you because you don't have to arrange it so that you have funds to cover these events or waste worry on whether or not he's going to like his gifts or give you anything in return. 

You have every right to have expectations. However, you have to be careful on who is going to fulfil those expectations. If he can't keep a job so that he has money in his pocket...I'm afraid it's going to hurt really really badly at the end."

You need to be blunt with him and tell him that he needs to grow the fuck up and be a parent and husband.  Those are his #1 relationship jobs now, not being a good little boy for his mommy.  Ask him if he wants your child to die.  Preemies can and have died from getting sick.  Your baby's health is more important than you in-laws feelings.  Ask them why they're trying to kill your child.  Be rude and make them uncomfortable.  Better for them to get hurt feelings than for you to have a sick baby.

445,"When she called you drunk and crying, what was she crying about? If my wife called me crying and intoxicated from a work event I would probably go get her, or at minimum make sure I had spoken to someone sober I could trust who was making sure she was OK. Honestly would do the same for a buddy who called me blind drunk and upset. People can get robbed in those situations, be raped, or die. Maybe she didn't text you she was OK because she WASN'T OK. It seems odd to me that what you seem most worried about is that she didn't text you, not that she was in danger."

456,"To a point he's not wrong. Those are reasons to feel helpless and depressed. They're facing a really shitty world out there with prospects lower than the generations before him.

How debt will be through the ceiling if he goes to college, owning a home is a fantasy for most- these things are depressing full grown adults. Timing them finicially and mentally- it's clear to see that in the faces of people your age or older working at Burger King because social security tanked on them with inflation and will tank harder on us with the retirement age standing at 70 instead of 55 these days.

Yes it sounds like he might have depression. No I don't blame him. He's really not being that cynical. He's facing a very shitty reality for many people his age. Ask around an see how they feel about the new world of they're aware of it. 

You cannot tell him anything to make him feel more hope about his situation. There really isn't much right now,. Instead try and offer him some support to face those fears. He feels left behind because it's abundantly clear he is behind and it's being pushed left and right ""if you're not first, you're last"" this has less to do with you and more to do with outside influences. You can't really stop those. You can suggest a break from the news or social media but he knows it's still there. He's just now uninformed about how it's changed recently if at all.

I keep seeing posts and articles of parents asking why their children are so afraid of the future instead of excited. Why they act hopeless. Why they feel hopeless. Why they are depressed.

It's a depressing time in American history and he's responding to it. Just like an adult might. He's cutting out the middle man of years of soul crushing use of a corrupt system and going right to what takes most people in their 30s to figure out.

This doesn't seem like help since it offers little advice. I'm only trying to offer some perspective because maybe you do know the right thing to do, you just don't know the cause. Like trying to rest symptoms instead if a root Illness. I definitely suggest a therapist so he can work through some of these emotions and learn to cope. This is not a cure all and don't expect his tune to change immediately or maybe at all. He may just get better at handling these feelings of hopelessness internally or in his own.

Your son had every reason to feel bleak. He should get help to cope with it. That's literally all we can suggest.

Staying home to take care of the animal you took responsibility for is entirely reasonable and I totally understand your frustration at your boyfriend not understanding this and wanting to stay with you.

""She's been a vegan for years!""  ""No GF, she ordered the same thing I did. I made a joke about it""

""We must have mis-remembered.""  ""There's no way we mis-remembered all of these instances.""

Be polite. Have any evidence (any messages or texts) on hand. Don't start off by saying this friend is awful. Start by saying you're becoming very uncomfortable with her behavior and you want to talk it out with each other.  That you understand they've been best friends since childhood but there are things that aren't adding up. Stress to your girlfriend that you love her but you're very worried about these lies.  But also let your girlfriend say what's on her mind as well. If you dictate the entire conversation, it'll just be seen as attack on her friend. It has to be an open, honest, kind discussion between you two.  You could even frame it as you want to make sure there are no more ""mis-remembered"" incidents between you two. 

Your gf is so happy to have her friend back, but she needs to be weary if this ""friend"" starts asking for money.

482,"\&gt; he isn’t a kisser.

\&gt; he can’t touch a vagina with anything other than his genitalia because he thinks they’re gross.

\&gt; We’ve literally only had sex once since we got married in September

I don't want to leap all the way to ""he's a closeted homosexual"" but let's just say this is not quite what I would consider 'normal straight man behavior'.  And telling a woman that you think all vaginas are gross (to the point that you will actually refuse to touch one with your hands) is usually something I'd expect to hear from a gay man or possibly a child.  Just saying.

\&gt; he his this from me until after we were married so I couldn’t do anything about it (he denies that, though)

Maybe he didn't on purpose, but intentionally or not, that is what he did.

Bottom line, whatever the cause, your husband is dropping the ball hardcore and you are right to feel upset.

\&gt; He gets upset when we talk about it because he thinks that he’s not what I want..

Uncool.  I was in a relationship where our sex life sucked and my SO refused to talk about it.  Guess what, we're not together anymore.  The real problem was that she refused to give a shit about my needs and wants, the sex was just a symptom.

Make it clear to your husband that HE is what you want, but his *behavior* IS NOT AT ALL what you want, to the point that it's falling short of your NEEDS.  Try counseling or anything else that he believes can help him get over this.  

Sustained communication is the key, and if he improves, it won't be after one conversation where he snaps into the perfect lover.  But if he's willing to work with you and make an honest effort, that counts for something. 

But also, don't gaslight yourself.  Unless there are some very important details you've left out, his approach to your sex life is the problem.  You have the right to a decent sex life, you made it clear what you wanted from the outset, and you're stuck with a bait-and-switch scenario with a guy who not only isn't good in bed, but won't even voluntarily touch a vagina.  Let me just put it this way, people have been divorced for less.

Hope it works out but trust your gut on this, you are not off base.

Note that this is general advice moving forward in your life, too.  If you ever live anywhere with shared walls - dorms, apartments, condos, hotels, etc - you're occasionally going to overhear people's private moments, and there's really nothing to be gained by bringing it up unless it's REALLY intruding into your life in a way that you can't practically ignore."

* He finds the thong and knows it's not yours because you don't wear a thong, but since he's never cheated he'd assume that it's from one of his old girlfriends.  Would he hide it in your sweatshirt?  No he wouldn't, he'd just throw it away.

* He finds the thong and knows it's not yours because you don't wear a thong, and because he knows he cheated.  Would he hide it in your sweatshirt?  No he wouldn't, he'd just throw it away.

If you went so far as to condone sex in your house, then you also should give her the education and resources that she needs to be safe from pregnancy and STDs. These are adult decisions that you are trusting a teenager with (teens don't always make the best choices). 

Since you and your husband know she is having sex why would he think it's okay to walk in on her while she is with her boyfriend? That is quite a privacy breach if the door was closed."
520,"&gt; Frankly, it's shitty etiquette of her to have sent you a save the date and now be making your invitation conditional.

Yep. I don’t actually think the condition itself is wrong - I mean, OP’s friend has been dating this guy for *years*, yet OP’s never met him? Maybe they aren’t that close anymore, and there are others closer to the couple whom it would make more sense to invite.

But that absolutely should’ve been figured out *before* the save-the-dates, like you said.

If you ask someone to save a date on their calendar for your wedding, it should be a given that they’re truly invited to said wedding. Asking someone to save the date because you *might invite them* is selfish and cruel."
521,"Then after the inevitable outrage, say “hey, calm down. I was joking”"
522,How does your mom not know your dad's nickname for you or your phone number? 
523,"It seems like the main problem here is not your libido but the fact that he doesn't care about your pleasure or comfort at all during sex? He doesn't seem willing to compromise or work on the issue at all with you, whereas you are compromising quite a lot."
524,"Seriously. I don't see mentioned anywhere where OP actually uses his words appropriately and says ""gf, I'm so turned on by you. I'd love to have sex / touch you / make out /whatever. You want to?""

Instead he just drives in and keeps going until she rejects him. His constant attempts to push her into being in the mood have made this situation so much worse.

People, USE YOUR WORDS. Women are human beings and can respond to you with more words, and then you can both know wtf is going on. "
525,Possibly she has a type? And so maybe the dad looks a bit like you? 
526,"I'd go so far as to say I even understand why he might raise an eyebrow at Jason getting her her favorite flowers in addition to the fruit basket. When I read the gift I did have the reaction, ""that's kind of a lot to get a coworker."" However, as soon as she said that it was on par with what he got everyone and her sunflower love is common knowledge at work, it should have become a nonissue. If his insecurity and jealousy caused him to bring it up again that might be something that could be worked on, but throwing away your property and ripping up the card? That is beyond the pale."
527,This is terrible. Strangers would offer help to a girl drunk and about to pass out on the street. Your friend is not a good person and you should not rely on him.
528,"&gt;but my sister was apparently a really late bloomer and even I have to admit looks great, especially for 40. So that's hard.

Why is it hard for you to admit that your sister is pretty? Why do you feel like you are the only one who can be ""the good looking one""?

&gt;""Sorry didn't know he was communal property lol""

Your sister's response was actually perfect because her relationship with him is none of your business or any of your friend's business. You're all MARRIED and he is a single dude that found someone he connects with. 

I would strongly recommend therapy to get to the root of all of your jealousy. It seems obvious to an outsider reading this, but there is probably a lot more history here to be discussed with a professional. You need to work on what you can change in your life to make you happy. You're clearly not happy because you're pining after the life you never had. Well, you have a life and you need to figure out how to appreciate what you and your husband have built for yourselves. Let go of the vision you had for your life because this, in the moment, is your actual life and you are going to miss out if you keep dreaming about what you ""could have had"" and pining over your sister's life.

530,"&gt;The rest of the team just sat there awkwardly going about their jobs.

I suspect the rest of the team was silently cheering you on.   The bystander effect kicks in for situations like this so don't be upset that no one else spoke up.   People are afraid to be confrontational.   Good for you for standing up for your co-workers.   "
531,"So the thing that makes me most sure that he is lying is not his story (which is suspicious, but doesn’t strike me as impossible) but his reaction. He has joked for a long time about being reluctant to meet you...if he had a genuine medical crisis that came up right before you were supposed to come, he would not have been surprised that you initially assumed this was a way for him to get out of meeting you in person. Even if he was hurt or upset by your reaction, a normal, truthful person would have responded by confirming for you that it was true, and apologizing for the massive inconvenience this is for you. 

The fact that he jumped straight to blocking you is not the normal response of someone who was excited to see a friend and then was forced to change plans at the last minute for health related reasons. 

How comfortable are you with solo trips? If you don’t mind traveling alone you could still have a good time, depending on the destination. Otherwise I would see if you could get a refund for your plane tickets or have the cost transferred to another flight. Hopefully it won’t be too late for you to find somewhere special and enjoyable to spend the holidays. "

534,"Everyone in your gf's family is going insane and it is not on you that no one double checked or confirmed that you were picking her up. Did your gf talk to you about it again? Did the mom? Did the sister herself? One text saying maybe is not confirmation that you were going to do it, especially when no one even told you any information about it.

Honestly, I would try and get a little space from your gf and her family right now. Spend the night at a hotel or a friend's house if possible. I think some space in this situation for you guys would be good until everyone in your gf's family calms down."
535,"""I'm sorry, I've looked into this and I don't have the money or time off to come visit you at the moment. I've already booked all my time off for the wedding itself and there's none left to use, and that's also where my travel budget for the year is reserved for. Could we arrange a virtual meetup so I can get to know your fiance, via skype, instead? Would it be possible for you to come visit me?""

If she responds that the only possible thing is for you to come visit her, tell her that you're sorry that you're going to miss her wedding, but like you said, you've looked into it and it's literally impossible to do what she's asking of you, that you're hurt that she thinks so little of your ten year friendship that she'd expect this of you and not want you there for such an important step in her life. You're sorry, but it's just not possible for you to make it out for a visit even if that means that she won't let you come to her wedding because of it. You love her and wish her the best.

And then accept that this is a friendship petering out because of her rude behaviour and lack of consideration towards you and slow fade. "

543,"Wow, this is a really hard situation. First, I assume there are consequences for her when she does this, and especially for the violence. Second, you need a new therapist NOW. Perhaps a child psychiatrist. But the current one is not a good fit anymore.

Second, consider family counseling. Your son needs to know this is a safe home for him. You didn't say his past, but if he's 10, he may have a background where there was violence or things being thrown. Just because he seems ok doesn't mean that he is ok.

546,"Hey man, good luck with the question, but keep in mind she may lie. If the ""dad"" is paying child support, is listed on the birth certificate, and has been this kids dad for three years...well she may lie. 

It is also unlikely that you could legally compel a DNA test unless she admits it could be yours since the kid already has a dad. I do not even know if it's possible to collect child support from a guy for 3 years and then switch dads. I suspect even if the kid isnt biologically his, he would be the leagal dad until he gives up his rights(once a dad is a dad for so many years there is no disproving it, even with DNA that guy is legally the father) 

This potentially ruins this guy's life, and could completely change this kid's future. So you better be prepared to step up in a serious way. It is also fairly irresponsible to wade in swinging before being fully aware of the current kid dad situation.  /u/animoorgan

547,"I say this as a mom to 2 year old twins with a 3rd due any day.  Your daughter is 6 months old now.  Why can't she put her down for a few minutes to get a couple of other things done?  Plop her in a bouncy or a swing for a few minutes.   They can go for daily stroller walks so your wife can get in a little exercise and get outside.   As another person mentioned, 6 months is a good time to sleep train so she can sleep through the night.  That should do wonders for her frame of mind, too.  Best wishes to you both.  Having a child is tiring, but there are free/cheap ways of making things work.  "

&amp;#x200B;

If you can't partially or entirely remove him from your life for some reason, then you should probably seek the assistance of a councelor at your university to help provide the grounding and emotional stability you need to get through your degree. As long as you acknowledge that what your father is doing is not only wrong, but actually kind of sick, then you are keeping your head above water. It sounds like you may not see this behavior for as abusive as it truly is. This is his issue and has NOTHING to do with you. It is very likely that even if you were ""perfect"" physically and academically, he'd jump on the first opportunity to berate you for not being perfect. You're just a target of his own issues. Please also know that you are doing well! And whether it's healthy or not, most people put on weight during university - you do have to sit around a lot to study, and eat to keep the brain alive, sometimes great food options aren't available or are not affordable regularly... either way, you should be healthy and work hard for you, not your abusive father.

552,"This post is really wholesome. 

First things first. There's nothing wrong with not being a festive person and not really getting into the spirit of the holidays. 

Dress code - ask your friend.

Presents - Maybe get a gift for your friend and then bring some booze or candies for the household.

Alcohol - You do not have to drink. I don't think people will question you but if they do a simple 'I don't drink' should be sufficient.

Helping with chores - When someone starts clearing the table offer to help. Same with if you see someone washing up, ask them if they would like some help. Otherwise don't worry.

You didn't actually threaten to dump her, or take any action, you just made a speech and then showed that the behavior was completely acceptable, by not having any repercussions for her.  You're too attached to dump her, no matter how much she cheats.

Break up the relationship.  Start with a full break up, and then if she's willing to ""work"" and prove her faithfulness, then you can forgive and get back together."

If you are so upset by him being open to different things sexually than you are, maybe you shouldn't be in this relationship.

Often they think that it's the best thing so as to ensure their kids have a relationship with their dad, or they are cautioned by friends and family not to ""alienate"" the child with honesty about what shite the father is.

I think this pressure is not fair to the mum who has to swallow what he's done to her, and not fair to the children who always eventually find out, but your mum was probably doing what she was told was best, or even was told that any other choice she made could endanger her custody of you.

"
569,"I am going to speak from experience. And I really hope you listen to what I say. 

Being with someone who is a unreasonably jealous, makes life a living hell. You miss out on normal healthy relationships and activities with other people. 
You find yourself avoiding a reaction to their inappropriate behavior, to avoid their rage or being accused of “starting problems.” 
It will start to make you unreasonably anxious in what are commonplace and harmless situations for the rest of the world, such as grabbing dinner after a meeting with a group of male coworkers. 
You will find yourself being accused of things that aren’t true, and question yourself when you are gaslighted and manipulated. 
It will start small and continue to grow in a way that is unhealthy for both people. 

My advice is go to counseling now. Get the issues of rage and control that seem to be hiding beneath the surface out in the open in a place where you are supported by a professional. If you don’t you will be setting yourself up for a long and exhausting battle that will erode your relationship as time goes on. "

573,"DO. NOT. GET. MARRIED. What if he decides one day that he can't ""rid"" himself of his homosexuality? You're connected to him but not at the hip. Break it off, take some time for yourself if you don't think you can be a supportive friend to him right now."
574,"From experience this generally happens when there is either too much intensity or frequency in a relationship.

By the first I mean emotional intensity.  Do you generally form deep friendships?  The kind where there is a lot of personal and emotional disclosure?  This creates an atmosphere of intense emotional intimacy that can be interpreted as romantic.

Frequency is how often and for how long you're in contact with friends.  Is it lots of texting, calling or visiting?  Little gestures here and there through the week?  Again, this creates a positive feedback loop that can be construed as romantic.

If there is a mix of both, then it can get out of hand fast.

Do any of the above ring true?  If so, then perhaps it is time to redraw some boundaries.  Don't fall down the rabbit hole of personal disclosure or excessive bonding.  Hold back on how much you contact the friend and meshing lives.

I know this seems rather vague but it's hard to give specific advice without a clear picture of how you form friendships and how a friendship progresses for you.  Can you give any further information?"

You do sound like you haven't mentally moved past your second year of college, which is understandable if you've spent the past decade raising 3 kids. But it is a little strange to see a 30 year old woman judge people based on how hot they were 15 years ago and be this possessive of an acquaintance you barely knew. It sounds like you switched pretty quickly from being ""hot girl"" to being ""midwestern mom"" and didn't have that time in your early 20s to struggle into becoming a real person. It's like you're an adult but you've never tasted the responsibility and freedom that comes with that.

Honestly I think you just need a job or a hobby or a volunteering thing that you're really serious about, so that you're not wasting your life snarking with the suburban moms and teetering on the line between superiority and jealousy for your sister. You need to engage in some self-growth but mainly you need to get off your ass and out of your head. It's much harder to have the time to feel jealous of others when you're busy living your own life."
587,"I would be SO HAPPY if I saw that my bf was as much into skincare as I am! This has NOTHING to do with your sexuality. As another commenter pointed out earlier, it's 2018 (almost 2019), you take care of yourself however you want to."
588,"I have been on both sides of this coin, I think. I’ve been in a relationship where I felt there was NEVER non-sexual intimacy; if he touched me or kissed me he would ALWAYS try to lead it to sex. It lead to me never really wanting sex and not wanting to be touched, kissed, bothered at all because I felt pressured and like a living sex doll. (It didn’t help the sex was awful and selfish too). 
Having the higher libido is hard and frustrating too, especially if you feel the sex is ALWAYS on their terms and they never initiate. 

That said, I think you both are hurting each other’s mental health. I think it can be hard to recover from this because you both have developed these odd patterns of interacting with each other. But if you want to, I think you guys should discuss some ways of resetting this balance. Sit down with her and have a talk - take sex off the table for a week. Tell her you WILL NOT ask for, push for, or initiate sex for 7 days - you want to develop intimacy without it and work on comfort. Cuddle, make out, kiss, spoon, etc. and keep your word. Don’t lead into sex. I know it’s hard but she feels pressured every time you lay hands on her and recoils and that’s really, wildly unhealthy and your goal is to just enjoy each other without that dynamic. 
After seven days revisit, check in with each other, have a convo about how you both feel. It’s up to you guys when you put sex back on the table - maybe she has to initiate? I don’t know if this will work in the long run because she clearly has sexual hangups/trauma that need to be addressed and your libidos are mismatched, though. "
589,"You're definitely not obligated. Even if you had a brilliant relationship with them, you still wouldn't be, as they're not your children, you don't know them, if you don't think you can raise them and change your entire way of life for then then of course not.
Then add onto the fact that you were driven out if the family in the first place. I think it's only fair you did get the house as it belonged to your mother and all the other things belonging to her were taken from you.

That isn’t true remorse. This wasn’t an affair. This is a person who threw your health and safety to the wind. Condoms aren’t failsafe. He took a risk with your health. Your life. Your children. And I don’t think in this case that staying or counseling is what will fix it.

If you have to take an airplane to get back to your family, move ASAP, there are restrictions on pregnant women flying because the change in air pressure can induce early labor, though this was a third trimester consideration and also old restrictions that applied to my mother over 30 years ago.

In some way I understand him, he's trying to build a different life with someone else, and is investing in his new relationship. Which means for a variety of reasons he can't support you, because that's part of his process for moving on. But you need people you can trust and lean on right now. For your health, move back with your mom."
595,"Yeah an eleven year age difference when she's only 20 just screams red flags, also the fatherly figure stuff was a bit weird. "
596,"I agree, she uproots her life and he helps to stabilize her future. It is not a big deal and if he is really in the top 1-2% than it is a drop in the bucket. On the other hand OP should call it a gift for moving expense so his gf can choose what to do with it. Of course he could hint which action would be most fiscally responsible. "
597,"Your wife has become abusive.  To *both* of you.  Your primary responsibility in this situation is to protect your daughter from being abused further.  If that means separating from your wife, that's what it means.

Normally I'd recommend therapy and so forth, because it's clear that *something* has changed that has caused your wife to become like this...but she's already *in* therapy, and it sounds as if things are not getting better.

It's important that she continue to work on what is clearly a personal issue related to fear of loss of control (thus the routines and rules and the freak-outs if they are not followed).  But while she does that, and *regardless* of her personal journey and struggles, she doesn't get to abuse a 9-year-old kid for *any* reason.

Until *she* gets herself together, the two of you *cannot* be.  For your daughter's sake."
598,"Op, you did ask for details. You asked your GF and she shrugged the question off. Don’t let them gaslight you like this.

Also the sister is old enough to not worry about her like this. It’s really odd. Yah it sucks to be stuck at the airport but it’s so over the top how everyone is reacting. She’s 23. She’ll live."
599,"&gt;She has a crush on him and she wants to hang out with him alone, where she can pretend you don't exist and that she's his ""work wife"" who he really wants. 

Exactly. When OP isn't around she gets to pretend she's his #1, the girl he wants to be with. When she sees OP with her boyfriend, she has to face reality and she can't handle it."
600,"Maybe that’s part of the problem. It could be that Sarah got judgmental vibes from Christian, and OP has done way more to defend and back up Christian than they have their own girlfriend. Perhaps she feels she’s being overlooked in favor of Christian as far as priorities and support, and that’s causing a lot of resentment which brings out the overreactions. "
601,Why does she have to consent to the divorce?  Just do it yourself dude.
602,"Same. I never ever ever think about my ex (who cheated on me with at least three different women) and have no feelings for him but wish him well, etc. But if I were to be reminded out of the blue of some of the shit he put me through, esp. after a glass of wine or two and maybe also if I were tired, I might have to cry a bit. I got myself into therapy to work through some of this, but if I hadn't, these feelings might be even more pronounced. "
603,"&gt; Bf's parents replied polite but in German. I translated it for my parents and bf's mum said 'Only German in this house, dear'. I replied no, because I don't want to exclude my parents from the communication.

His parents and family were being very rude. They had house guests that came a great distance to visit them. They all spoke a common language that was no one's native language. Yet they still insisted on German to the exclusion of your parents. 

Beware of dating a person who will put his family above your needs. "
604,"Lawyer here. While I can’t provide personalized legal advice in this forum, a person similarly situated to you should decline such a request, PLUS loans are taken out by parents - you can no more adopt PLUS loans than you can adopt your dad’s credit card debt. You’d likely have to take out a new loan in your own name and pay off the PLUS loan with the proceeds.

That said, there is nothing stopping you from helping your dad out with loan payments if he’s strapped for cash. But you don’t have to!

605,"First question: has she been evaluated for post partum depression? Since she wasn't too keen on being a parent to begin with it is entirely possible she is suffering from depression, and it could become full-blown post patrum psychosis if you two beat around the bush to get that evaluated...

Second question, were you both making roughly the same amount of money before you two became parents? If so, would it be possible for you to become a stay at home dad while she works? What about having the grandparents take on the child so you both can work?

Looking at post-partum issues is definitely step one before looking at other options, though."

610,"Because the only reason he was shit talking his so called ""friend"" so much was to keep his girlfriend. He sounds like a total gem.... OP, if he talks this badly about her yet follows her drunk to a friends house.... what do you think he is telling her about YOU? "
611,"&gt;Is this just ""guy talk""?

​No, it is not. 

&gt; I'm worried he'll turn it around on me for snooping.

Oh, he will. He will because he's admitted that he's just going to sleep around. 

&gt;How do I confront him?

I don't think you confront him. I think you just tell him that it's come to your attention that he believes he cannot be monogamous, that you respect his decision, and that the relationship is over. Go roam free, ex-BF! Let the wind be at your back! Don't get an STD!

And then go on with your life. 

"
612,"I have additional questions. Such as:

1. If the friend knows that OP is so broke that she can hardly afford to pay attention, why did she not offer to make the flight out to see OP?

2. Why does this gal's fiancee ""need"" to vet her friends? This isn't American Idol, ffs. And if it is, I sincerely hope OP emails back and tells her friend, 'Yea, that's gonna be a no from me, dawg'. "

615,She sounds jealous and your bf probably needs to take a step back from the friendship or reaffirm his boundaries with her. They need to go back to being coworkers and nothing more. 
616,"I think people are being too harsh here and jumping to conclusions with too little information. This is how I imagine the situation went down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Friend and fiancé put together a guest list. After running the numbers they realised how expensive it would be and that they'd have to reduce guests (note: save the dates have not been sent out yet, OP confirmed). They disagreed who to leave out - he wants his friends to come, she wants her friends to come, they struggle to agree on a list. So they come up with a ""rule"". People who are close friends would have met both of them by now right? So let's just invite people who are friends of the couple, who have at least met both of them. Guest list is shorter and looking good now, but there's one long-distance friend of the fiancée that he hasn't managed to meet yet. So she suggests they'll just have to meet her before the wedding. Clearly does not think through the logistics of taking time off and flying there. Maybe they are richer or have more flexible jobs so they don't see the big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Note, this is still a pretty shitty thing to do, but I don't think it's at the level of, he's a controlling monster and she's a terrible friend. They clearly should consider coming to visit her or skype. She should raise those possibilities with them and she how they react. "
617,"You need to respect yourself enough to tell your husband this is making you uncomfortable.  Because from what you wrote it definitely seems like you are.   The texting is completely inappropriate.  He needs to respect you enough to tell her to stop.  It is not about “being nice” or him being “too stupid” to realize what’s going on it.  It is about boundaries.  And they are , in my opinion being crossed.  Multiple times.  I repeat, you should not ignore this or play it off if it makes you uncomfortable, and you need to make that clear to your husband.  If he loves you and is a good man he will understand your point of view and take action.   "
618,"&gt;When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me.

He sounds like a gaping asshole"
619,"I couldn't imagine being able to fall asleep after leaving someone alone on the side of the street unable to care of themselves. Honestly, this makes me wonder if he lacks empathy in general as a human. Maybe go through your filodex of memories and ask yourself if he's been cruel to others, animals, or shown signs of these types of behaviors in the past. It's weird to me that he would go from 'good mate' to 'I don't care if you die' because of an annoying drunk night. "
620,A promise ring for adults is not the way to go. It’s childish and would make her think you’re trying to put it off. Perhaps you could start discussing the kind of ring you can get?

625,"I was out drinking with one of my girlfriend's at a bar about 15 blocks from my house. We start chatting with this guy who was was really nice, but had been hitting the drinks pretty hard. 

We played pool until the bar closed and we're all walking back towards my house. This guy is stumbling all over the place and completely incoherent by this point. After about 3 blocks he starts leaning sideways like he was trying to balance on the Titanic and just...keeps going. 

Falls exactly sideways straight into the bushes. It was so comical we stood there and laughed hysterically for a minute while trying to rouse the guy and he's just mumbles and turns over. We look at each other like, ""Shit, well what do we do now?!."" 

So we each grabbed a shoulder. This guy was really tall and well over 200 pounds and my friend and I are barely 5'3 on a good day and maybe 200 lbs between us. 

We dragged his drunk ass half a mile back to my apartment. We kept having to stop and take breaks because he was so heavy and we were still laughing pretty hard the entire way home. By the end of it we were all sweaty and gross and not in the good way lol. 

We end up tossing him on the couch and notice he's got a pretty decent goose-egg on his forehead. We weren't sure if he gave himself  a concussion so we called the paramedics and they hauled him off. He ended up leaving his phone on our couch, so we called up some of his friends until someone answered and told them where he was and where they could get his phone. 

The point of my long-winded story is your friend is an asshole. There's not many people who would leave a stranger passed out on the side of the road -- let alone a really good friend that you fucking live with. You were **3 blocks away** he could have fireman-carried you home then given you the lecture in the morning if he felt like you were too irresponsible. 

He's just not so nice. I kinda get the feeling he might be into you though, only because his reaction was so extreme. Maybe he didn't like the fact you were talking with that other guy, or maybe he was trying to score and he felt like you ruined his chance with someone else so he got his shitty revenge. 

Either way the guy is just a big fat jerk. I'm really sorry that happened to you. The thing is he could have told Lisa he left you down the street but he didn't say a fucking word. He knew what he did was messed up that's why he didn't tell anyone. 

I would just slow fade. Ignore him as much as possible. He owes you a huge apology. "

630,"Sounds like she was asked to recount a particularly painful time in her life and she was genuinely upset remembering it. Doesn’t mean it’s about you or that she is not over him. 

I’d definitely say there should be further conversation, but I also think it is far more likely that she is upset by this past betrayal and recounting the very painful memory associated with it. "

632,"Your mom has caused so many issues in your marriage that your wife is telling you counseling is a must, and she is afraid you will be separated before next Christmas and you are still just worried about not upsetting your mom this Christmas?!

As so many others have said , there is no question here, you side with your wife. I would show her that the marriage is a priority by being the one to schedule counseling after the holidays."
633,"&gt; I don't know HOW to bring this up without seeming ungrateful, materialistic, or hurtful

I don't think it's THAT unusual for someone in your position to want an upgrade, but I do think you need to be prepared for the possibility that the suggestion upset him. You can get a new ring, but it won't be THE ring. 

If I were in his shoes, I would probably respect the idea to augment the current ring rather than getting a whole new one more. That way you're still making use of the object he worked hard for, and it's symbolic of the success and growth you've had since marriage.

635,"Another idea: if she isn't ready, you could always still ask her dad for his permission for later down the road. Maybe you can even get some recordings from him about his advice for marriage / him just saying stuff to her about xyz so that if you actually do get married, it could be like a wedding gift. Just be sure your lady is on the same page as you about marriage and don't drop a bomb like that on her in this difficult time without talking about it first. Good luck! "
636,"It seems like the sister is setting up a situation where she can blame other people for her poor choices.  She should be called out on this before anything happens.  It should be pointed out to her that no one is holding her down and forcing food into her mouth.  She makes the choice what to eat.  As long as there are healthy options she has no excuse.  

Alcoholics avoid bars. Fair enough.  But they can't avoid grocery stores.  She has to cultivate self control.  She can't control the whole world.  Driving by fast food joints, buying gas at a convenience store,  buying groceries,  she has to take control.  She's being unreasonable. 

Perhaps she's also wanting the attention and support she would feel if everyone gave in to her demands.  It's hard being the only one who can't indulge during the holidays.  If you have compassion for her then maybe you could go for a walk or two with her and let her talk about her struggles.  You can cheer her on as she makes healthy choices.  Not over the top, but a nod and a smile.

However,  I really think she's going to use you all as an excuse to break her diet and then blame you.  Don't buy it."

I need you here with me and OUR family for Christmas. I am recovering from a major event myself and have a fragile newborn who it is nonnegotiable to protect. I know this isn’t what we planned for Christmas but I look forward to making a family tradition of our own this year.”

642,"This is because your girlfriend does not want to take responsibility. If your girlfriend admits that she didn't get the information and pass it along to you, then it becomes your girlfriend's fault. Your girlfriend will feel terribly ashamed, and she doesn't want to take the blame. That's all this is. She will feel absolutely terrible because she's the one who dropped the ball, and she doesn't want that on her conscience.

When I was in high school, I was a champion at doing this. And it sucked. And it took me therapy to learn that what I was doing was wrong and selfish, absolutely unacceptable, and only by taking personal responsibility for my actions could I grow and thrive as an adult.

I would explain to your girlfriend that you know this is not your fault. I would tell her point blank ""Gf, we both know what happened. I asked you for details, you did not provide them to me, and because of that, your sister was stranded at the airport. You and I both know this isn't on me, and you're trying to deflect so that you don't feel bad. I need you to take responsibility for your oversight. We all make mistakes, and all you did was make a mistake. And that's okay. But we both know this isn't my mistake, and blaming me for this is absolutely wrong. I need you to take responsibility for this, because this isn't on me, it's on you. And I know it feels horrible, and I hope your family is kind enough to forgive you, and I hope your sister learns a lesson about communication and how to call an Uber. But until I know that you are able to take responsibility for your mistakes, I have to question some aspects of our relationship. Because it's important to me to know that when you make a mistake, you'll take responsibility, and not try to push the responsibility off on someone else."""

If that's the case drop her. 

Also look up the article on Vox ""My husband raped two women - and I had to answer for his crimes"". It may help you understand her perspective of not knowing her husband was a monster and give you ideas on how to be there for her. Because even if she drops him completely, there will be grief for the man she thought she knew, on top of everything else. And in order to support her you'll need to not judge that. "

649,"Well..9 years ago the guy was 21 years old. I think some of the downsides of being together/getting married since a young age is you haven't fully matured. Some people grow out of their wild side, some people don't. 

Sure, he could be depressed. Or this is who he is as a fully formed person. Or maybe he's one of those dudes who equates marriage to all the fun being over.

I also agree with getting into counseling to get to the bottom of it."
650,"This has been going on for a long time, when I was 7 years old or so I told my mom about it. But it kinda gets brushed off as it's nothing.  My mom has depression and I'm kinda affraid of her because she can become very angry and stuff. So never tell her anything. I don't know if he has mental health issues. "

660,"There is only one way to have this work out for you:

Demonstrate value and walk away. Staying with someone who lies and cheats isn't any more love than their lying and cheating. You're simply being needy and not loving yourself. 

Consequences are usually the only thing which brings about change for people. Reiterating the rules she should have been abiding by all along is nothing more than a free pass.

Right now, the outcomes don't look good. Investing more time and energy into someone who has broken your trust and may very well do it again makes it likely you'll have more regret and heartache later on.

If you tell her you're done and stick with that, you'll be able to heal and welcome something healthy into your life. 

And if she takes the lesson and works on herself, you might actually come back to something better with her.

Sorry to be blunt, I know this sucks. I wish someone spoke to me candidly when I was in the same spot."

What exactly are YOU getting out of this marriage? How does it benefit your life?"
664,"&gt;My father explained he had no clue what was happening when my mother screamed at him to get out of the house when he first saw her. She said that she ‘knew’ about his affair, and about ‘Bunny’. I knew at this point that my mother was completely mistaken. To fill you in, ‘Bunny’ is the nickname that I have had ever since I was little (I had big front teeth and was always bouncing around). This was a family nickname, with my father still using it to this day. 

&gt;I almost feel as if my mother is deliberately creating this situation for some bizarre reason. She knows that I’m ‘Bunny’, and that my father is devoted to her. I don’t want to speculate that there is a more sinister reason behind her acting this way, but I can’t conceive why she would act like this. 

I think you and your brother need to get a delegation together for an intervention (I'm serious about this - call your mom's siblings, her parents, anyone you can enlist that's NOT evil/crazy) and ask her to see a doctor. Because as you said, literally EVERYONE knows that you're ""Bunny"" (I assume) and that your mom is acting nuts. Normally I wouldn't say to air your parents' business to all and sundry but this is serious, your mom pretty clearly either needs help, OR this is some kind of deliberate, sinister act, and having everyone told about it will shame her into quitting (one hopes). If she wants out of her marriage, she can do that *without* accusing your father of cheating."
665,I absolutely agree. I would just advise you to make her part of the process. This isn't a good moment for a surprise. Tell her what you told us. If she agrees then do it and never bring it up again. Especially not in a fight.

This is where I would start digging. I find it hard to believe the social workers wouldn’t take the behavior you’ve described seriously. So I have to wonder if your parents are doing a poor job of describing the behavior. Even so, they can call back. "
671,"Gray rock him. Only talk to him if you have to, and keep it about work. He is in your past, let him stay there. If you are really losing sleep over it, get some counseling. But don't let him know you even remember him or what he did. He probably doesn't remember half of it. People like that act out to cover up their own internal psychoses. He probably thinks about you, way less than you think about him. Don't give him power over you, or any mental attention. "

That being said, I went to go to an art show Saturday and I got there after it had closed because I misread the Facebook page. I had to keep myself from crying, and it was really more a cumulation of stress and migraine hangover. Is there something else going on?"
673,"This was the case with me. 

My ex claimed he was cheated on multiple times by his past gfs. Then when I dumped him for being possessive and abusive he told everyone I cheated. 


He genuinely believed it too. He called me up multiple times demanding to admit what I did. He thought that I must be cheating or going after another guy cuz why else would I break up with him? 🙄


So yeah crazies exist. 

"
674,"Because people generally believe that when you get over someone, you also get over the pain. But that's not always the case, which for some people seems suspicious."
675,"I've been friends with my SO for a few years and dating a year and we still find stuff to talk about.

Talk about a movie trailer you saw, tell him about something funny you overheard in the store, maybe you wanna take a cooking class, maybe you remembered a book you loved as a kid, etc. There's always something.

If you get trapped in the ""how are you"" ""what are you doing"" hole you'll just get bored of each other. Find interests separate from each other and then share your experiences but also if there's nothing to say don't force the conversation. Especially if it just makes him feel bored"
676,Do you have a job or any kind of income? Buy your own food and hide it from them. 
677,So... he’s good to his dogs but he’s only good to people in his life when it’s convenient for him?  Alrighty then. 
678,"Holy shit - this should be at the TOP...because now the guy ripping up the card makes much more sense. Shame on you, OP, for not giving the full details in your post, in order to win people to your side."
679,"""You go fuck your brother and make up, young man!"""
680,"&gt; Holy shit, that is like a sociopathic level of horribleness

I work in mental health, and I know the word ""sociopath"" gets thrown around a lot when referencing shitty people, but I think you're actually, literally correct in calling him that. 

All of what she described is pretty shit, but this vacation thing is just pure unadulterated evil for the very simple pleasure of watching OP suffer and be humiliated. "
681,My coworkers walk me to my car every night after my shifts. Random people I’ve known for a month care more about me being raped/attacked/robbed than your boyfriend cares about you. 
682,"Like I said, you did nothing wrong. Give your gf some space and a chance to come to her senses, but if she continues treating you like you were in the wrong here, then this may be where your relationship dies."
683,Yes you break up with her and I would be concerned that she has acted upon these desires with your brother. You need to check with him. 
684,"Thank you for this super reassuring advice. Any suggestions on how to start that conversation? All that’s coming to mind so far is “So... ‘right back at ya,’ huh?” "
685,"That's very possibly his plan. However, if you stay he can still leave you, men do it all the time. If you get him to stay, you may get an emotionally distant and hurtful partner who ignores or mistreats your child. No father is much better than a bad father"
686,"That was what stuck out to me as a sign that this lady had no shame.

It’s pretty manipulative and a crappy thing to do, both to OP and to her own daughter.

OP the kid doesn’t miss you, her mom is a POS who is getting her to call you because she has no respect for your boundaries and hopes this will manipulate you back into her life."
687,"I just wanna say that this is really considerate and nice of you. This post is very sweet :D

Definitely clear out space for any stuff she might be bringing! The wardrobe and drawers are really nice. But if she has her own towels, spare blankets, kitchen stuff, etc. already having a plan to put those things somewhere is awesome. "
688,"here in Brazil some pipeworks are really narrow and throwing a paper into it can cause many problems. That's probably why she didn't do it, it's just a matter of being used to that. I throw used paper in the trash too, flushing it down isn't really an option due to the risk of clogging it all up."
689,"I like to think I'm not an overly reactive person, but if someone wrote that to me I would be weirded out, and if my husband got that card I would be pissed.  The language is just so wrong."
690,Is couples counseling available to you guys? I don't see your marriage surviving without it.
691,"The contract is legally sketchy. You can’t give away parenting responsibilities.  If she ever needs social assistance the state will want to know who the father is. If she listed him, he’s getting contacted. 

But if it actually scared her into not listing him, if she adopted it out(may need his permission for this) or if the parents argue the million was up front support it may be ok. Honestly the parents would have been better off with a contract saying dad prepaid a lifetime of support as that may actually hold in court. A contract saying he’s not the dad when DNA is a thing is dumb as hell. "
692,"But like, what’s not fair? You made your choices in life, she made hers. Where’s the unfairness?"
693,"You need to leave.

When a man puts his hands around your throat, you’re 7 times more likely to die as a result of domestic abuse. Leave. Now. Grab your stuff and go before he kills you.

If you stay, you’re more likely to die than someone who’s partner just (/s) hits them. Choking is a huge warning sign that the person may kill their partner. If you stay, you are literally playing Russian roulette with your life.

Please leave. You don’t deserve this. No one does. "
694,This is not ok. You have zero to be embarrassed about. This is abuse and you shouldn't be in this situation. I assume you arent in the US? I don't know what laws you have but you shouldn't have to live like this. It isn't your fault and you've done nothing wrong btw. You are the victim here and your parents suck. 
695,"If you need permission to leave, you have it from me. This guy physically hurt you. I don't care one bit if he was drunk, that is abuse. I never thought my ex would hit me either - until he did. Honestly, even before he hit you his behavior was abusive and the fact that you need to plan around him getting drunk tells me that you've normalized his bad behavior. 

You owe it to yourself and especially to your daughter to get out."
696,It's quite a ridiculous request. Who asks to vet a friend before a wedding invite?
697,"Try to put yourself in her place.  She doesn’t want to feel this way.  It isn’t a choice for her.  If you were in the same kind of state mentally, what kind of partner would you hope to have?  One who was there for you and was willing to stick with you until you got better or one who threw in the towel after a few bad months?

You are not only finding out what kind of person she is deep down inside, but also what kind of man you are too.  "
698,My best guess is that your BIL was hoping you'd either sleep with him without telling your husband or be too uncomfortable and ashamed to tell anyone he offered. That's how predators' minds work.
699,DON'T DO IT DON'T DO IT DON'T DO IT
700,"Lol, what? You’re not coming off as needy, selfish, controlling or overprotective to tell him that his ex isn’t welcome to stay in your home. Full stop. He’s being annoyingly oblivious. 

Oh, to be in my early-twenties again. "
701,"Adult conversation?  Good communication?  Happy ending?  Definitely posted in the wrong subreddit.

Congrats!"
702,Could imagine how bad it would've been if you found out about him sending her flowers and champagne and even a ring to her before speaking to him and sorting this out? Lol
703,"Completely inappropriate. If this were a dad commenting on a teenage girl like this it would EASILY be called a sexual predator. And that's what I'm going to call it. She is commenting about his GENITALS. She's known him since he was 15 and makes these comments? She should see him as a SON not a sexual object, no matter how mature or fit or whatever he may look. 

Take the advice of these commenters and call her out, calmly but firmly. It is sexual harrassment and makes everyone uncomfortable and is embarrassing for her, at the very least. But mostly makes her seem like a sexual predator. "
704,"Dump him. You have a project, not a boyfriend. 
"
705,"I think your title would more accurately read: ""my relationship is perfect except for my anxiety and jealousy""

&gt;I was determined for my first time to mean something with someone important to me 

Congrats, I guess?  You put so much pressure on yourself and this relationship to ""mean something"" it sounds like you've inadvertently ruined your ability to relax and enjoy it too."
706,"Damn...

&gt; I have told them numerous times they need to figure out their differences on their own as adults and stop bringing me into it 

So in other words you refuse to take responsibility for the relationships in your life?  Quality man right here.  And I love how it's all about you and how inconvenienced you are ... instead of the people in your life."
707,"It doesn't sound like he is healthy enough to be a responsible partner. You won't be able to trust him until he puts the effort in to be trust worthy and it doesn't sound like they can even do that. You can't really do anything but either wait for him to try and get better, or end the relationship and focus on taking care of yourself. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."
708,"Yeah her mother had said along the lines of  “I’ll ask [younger sister] and see what her plans are.” It wasn’t even a confirmation that they WANTED me to pick her up. It was more like ok he’s an option let’s see what else is out there before we confirm with anyone. 

There were so many steps between that and actually telling me that they wanted me to pick her up and here are the details. I only got to offer my help and they hadn’t even accepted. Just told me “ok we’ll see” basically. How was I supposed to know they hadn’t found someone else?"
709,"I feel so sorry for for daughter.  You're more troubled that your son is giving you the silent treatment than you are that she's walking around with a bruised face. Wake up!

Sounds like he's emotionally manipulating you so that you focus on his problems and not his actions. What he did to your daughter was horrible. 

Mandatory anger management and a real punishment would be nice. ""Bruised her a bit""?  JFC..."
710,"I hope you post an update! I don't have a lot of advice other than I feel that she's probably dealing with her own trauma. My older sister and I had very similar upbringings to you. My  sister has resentment towards me because she was there for me, yet no one was there for her. It's all a complicated mess. Perhaps your sister had something similar and decided to cut contact until she healed.

I am not sure. Maybe she's scared of fucking up as a parent also - because her parents fucked up. I think either way you two talking will be great for you both and I hope it is positive. "
711,"Sort of? I guess? I dunno. I've never been one. I guess I'd like to be one, but not if I'm gonna get shit for it from her."
712,I wouldn’t have a brother after something like that. Just terrible....
713,You need to get off of here and immediately find people who love you and let them take care of you.
714,"&gt;I don’t understand why he did this,

Because he's abusive. He is still abusing you. 

Abusers are often popular and charming with other people. It's how they hook you at first, and how they get other people on their side.

How is he finding out where your new jobs are? Because honestly, you might just need to make a clean break and get away from where you are entirely. "
715,"One other thing though... next time you buy a house, maybe consider finding your own home inspector.  Realtors are often in cahoots with inspectors because they know a passing inspection leads to a faster closing, so that can lead to glossing over big issues..."
716,"You're still doing it. You're not ""stuck"" with anything, seems like the only thing you're sticking with is a really bad attitude.

How is it sexist? I never said there was no value in being attractive as a woman (heck I know your story, I was ""discovered"" too to model at 16 in a grocery store parking lot too and for awhile my confidence rested on this type of attention, and now I'm 30, 10-15 lbs heavier and I'm SO MUCH HAPPIER). Happiness is a choice and an outlook.  I made the point that if you rest your happiness on comparison towards others, you will never learn how to be happy. Your perception is what is keeping you down.

Also, that's a pretty ridiculous way to see her. You know why? Nothing traumatic happened to you and comparing your situation of having 3 kids to being in a car wreck is positively off-putting. What's stopping you from working out and getting your figure back, and putting some time and money into your looks? Get extensions, lose weight/tone up and gain muscle, get a face lift...whatever it is that you're lacking confidence. That's up to you. No one took it from you. You decided to give up."
717,"I have literally heard a judge tell a woman that just because her husband hit her, it didn’t mean that he’d hit her child. Your mom most likely didn’t have a choice. "
718,I wish I could upvote this more! One of my college friends was strangled to unconsciousness twice when she was pregnant and it gave her baby brain damage. And it all started with him holding her arms so she “would listen” to him. Please leave now! 
719,"He doesn't appreciate your efforts.  So, stop exchanging gifts with him.

Next gift giving occasion, tell him that you're done exchanging gifts and he shouldn't get you anything.  Then buy yourself a little something."
720,"This is exactly what’s going on!

OP as a scapegoat child myself who is fortunate enough to have a completely supportive partner, I second this. Your husband will need to decide how he wants to deal with his family going forward. This will likely take years. The best thing you can do for him is validate his experiences and feelings when he does open up, and support his decisions. He has likely been invalidated and gaslighted by his family for his whole life. He may need to learn to remember that you are a safe place for him. Good luck!"
721,"I’m so sorry that your dad is an utter shitbag. Absolutely miserable for everyone involved. 

All you can do is start planning to move out as soon as possible. Look for roommates, shop for the best prices, make sure you have a reliable source of income. Don’t count on your dad for anything - he’s not stable and he’s not trustworthy. 

You were right not to let him in while he was acting violent and belligerent. And you were right to call the police. That was precisely the correct thing to do. Trust your instincts, because they’re serving you well. You can get through this. 
"
722,Run. Fucking run. He is at best nuts and at worst a stalker in the making. Block and move on. Trust your gut!!!
723,"I'd wait on that. If you do it, I'd wait until the new year. I'd also prepare yourself for the likely possibility that she will blame you or deny anything inappropriate went on.

If I were you I probably would just avoid him and not open that can of worms unless he does something further, but it all depends on what you're comfortable with."
724,What do you have to lose by asking? 
725,"Urg I get that might have been a miscommunication there but still she’s acting absolutely ridiculous. She group chat was still there. She knows exactly what you offered to do after she already offered you up on her behalf. She knew her mom was going to check and that her sister wasn’t even participating in that conversation. 

Any reasonable person would assume that when a kindness is offered, and details are requested, the ball is in the other party’s court to run with. This would personally be my hill to die on, because I would not stand for being berated by a SO and their family for matters better left to r/choosingbeggars"
726,"This isn’t an opinion, it’s a core belief about whether or not all people are actually equal and deserving of love, respect, and support. He believes that a gay child is not valuable and not deserving of love, respect, and support. The denial of parental love is one of the most scarring things you can do to a person. Essentially he has told you he would emotionally abuse your future child. He does not qualify as a parent. If you truly have a core belief that embraces queer people equally with straight people, it would be unethical for you to stay with him. For the sake of your future kids, this is a dealbreaker.



"
727,"Oh boy, she's got to be called out and stopped every single time she is pushy with them.  This is actually a serious situation because as a fellow livestock owner, cows can kill her if they get spooked.  I mean, one might just outright stomp her.  I know several people who have been seriously injured by cattle and I myself have had to RUN, dodge and vault over a fence.  So firstly she needs to understand that they are dangerous.  Second, she needs some hard fast rules set.  For instance, with the cows, no approaching at all.  No touching.  She can stand near the pen quietly until they are used to that- probably a month or so, cows have long memories.  Then potentially moving on to hand feeding or a pat.  But she needs to be outright banned from approaching them for her own safety.

Honestly same goes for the other animals.  The dogs can obviously bite her if they get too frustrated.  My own daughter when she was younger had boundary issues with pets- cats and dogs, same sort of thing.  Doing things that they don't like and then wondering why they didn't want to hang with her.  She is now great with all animals and they love her.  But basically time for a new rule where she is not allowed to touch them unless supervised until she learns how to treat them appropriately.  If she mishandles a cat then it's an immediate ""Put it down NOW or face consequences"".  She needs to be eased back into interacting with them and handling them in an appropriate manner.

I wish you luck."
728,"I would start refusing to go anywhere expensive. “Sorry, if we’re splitting everything 50/50 then we have to go where *__I__* can afford to eat. I can’t keep up with you financially.”"
729,"Wow. This story was crazy. I had to deal with your girlfriends situation a few years back. My childhood best friend who was everything to me I hadn’t seen since joining the military was hooked on drugs. I had no idea until I met up with her and even then it was obvious and I made excuses. 


It’s so SO hard but now she could either A) move on or B) confront the friend to see if she can help get her to admit basically she lied and move past and see the deeper issues here. 


You sound like an amazing supportive partner! Your girlfriend also sounds like she handles a crappy situation better than most. Way to help her through this!"
730,"I'm 54. Your mom is wrong. There is nothing in your age gap, if you can even call it that, that is even the slightest bit off-putting. 

Edit: holy hell I hate auto correct. "
731,"The lesson here is never tell your current employer, or coworkers, that you're actively looking at other jobs. Ever. Once you've stuck a deal, THEN put in your notice.

And by the way, that 2-week notice is a courtesy. Nothing more. If the tables were turned and your boss was the one terminating the relationship, you can bet real money you would not get notice.

Got a good relationship with your boss and plan to use them as references? Great! Give them the 2 weeks. Otherwise, it's their problem, not yours. She doesn't deserve your generosity.

Get to your new job and be happy. "
732,Leave her OP. You deserve better than this marriage with a woman who as given you no reason to trust her.
733,So you could say that she told OP to save the date...
734,"Okay you messed up, but he is FUCKED up. Run!!"
735,"Yeah, honestly, they both sound like they've twisted themselves into knots. Her reactions are not uncommon for someone who's been pressured into sex so frequently they just shut down, and his reactions are common for someone who feels entitled to sex in a relationship, but that doesn't make either side of it healthy for themselves or the relationship. ""We're going to makeout"" was definitely creepy and she was not gaslighting him. OP, someone telling you how they feel about your actions isn't gaslighting or manipulation. She's not training you to do anything, she's telling you how she feels. If a guy said that to me, I'd chew him out too. That said, how she feels is that she doesn't want to have sex... At all. For two years. Take a hint and move on if this is your hill to die on (and it's not wrong for it to be, at all). Its way better to break up with someone for sexual incompatibility than to pressure someone into conforming to your sexuality."
736,"So when I originally read the post, my thought was ""Holy Shit, this guy (the fiancee) is a nightmare. That's a totally inappropriate way to react to a gift from a male co-worker who is a good friend."" My wife has dude friends at work. She's literally out of town with one right now at a bar. I don't give a shit because I am a grown-ass man in a healthy and trusting relationship.

That said, I couldn't help but feel like there was something missing. The reaction seemed \*so extreme\* that it didn't fit with the details as given by OP...That's when she starts trickle-truthing, right?

Turns out, this dude who she's ""really good friends"" with at work...she's never really mentioned him to her fiancee.

Also, Turns out, he's ""really good looking""

Also, Turns out, they ""talk all the time at work"" but only ""text sometimes""

Oh, and also, he wrote a very inappropriate note to her in the card where he says she fulfills his eternity and has a cute nickname for her.

In a vacuum, none of those things singularly are an issue, together they tell a different story.

&amp;#x200B;

She brings these things home, he tells her that's weird that she's getting gifts from dudes who as far as he knows are completely random at work. The next morning, he reads the card and finds out that it's not just a rando, it's a dude who she apparently has a very special relationship with, but never bothered to mention once. He got super pissed. At this point, he super fucked up and ripped her shit up and threw it away. That was a bad choice every single time, but in context not the most unsurprising reaction from a 24 year old.

&amp;#x200B;

I think OP left this important detail (the contents of the card) out of the post for a reason, because it changes almost everything. I think that OP left out literally ever mentioning her relationship with Jason to her fiancee for the same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: typos"

738,"I think you’re still missing the point. You make several attempts here to effectively retroactively assign the blame to your roommate for “not thinking” when she texted you. What you continue to fail to see is that there was nothing wrong with her asking you in the first place!! So even if she is willing to roll over on this so as not to make waves, you still sound really curmudgeonly and self-righteous. 

Also, the very fact that you went from calling them dangerous and making accusations about their lifestyles but now you “love” both of them is also a huge red flag to me. You need to treat these people as exactly what they are, strangers with whom you cohabitate. If you can become friends, awesome, but already declaring you love them, to me at least, is just another example of you having an over-the-top reaction to a total non-issue."
739,"I just got married and planned a pretty large, formal wedding. We pruned the guest list before the save the dates went out. Which is the sane and polite thing to do. Everyone who got a save the date got an invitation. It is pretty rude to prune after save the dates."
740,"Since you say she has issues with mental health I'm wondering if she's having some kind of mental health problem right now, doesn't have the right coping skills, and is self destructing. I think both individual therapy for her and couples counseling would do you guys good. Good luck"
741,"Imo he just doesn’t want to lose you so is saying what you want to hear (he just wants you etc). His sexuality is not a switch to turn on or off, if he is gay he will be gay forever and this will definitely come up again. The history must be a huge reason to stay, but you can build that with someone else. Your time will come but probably not with him. Take it as a lesson and move on with your life, finding happiness from yourself instead of a significant other. And also for him, he deserves his happiness too. You’ll get through this, we can adapt to things quicker than you think! 

In short, yes rip the band aid off and be done with it - natural distance in your friendship will occur and you’ll both move on. So sorry this has happened, but take the positives from it, how much you have learnt and grown with him and the memories you have shared, and more importantly, the amazing new people yet to meet. "
742,"Go get some therapy. And here's why. You have a 15 year old. He is right at the point where he is getting ready to fly and be independent. And then it will be your 12 year old. And then what? What kind of friendship circle do you have? Who is nourishing your soul? Because, to be frank, you cannot expect a bunch of fledgling adults to meet your emotional needs. They have their own shit to sort out, and I know you are the kind of mother who will WANT them to sort it out because you want them to grow into healthy adults. But you deserve to have some help and support as you build a support structure that will sustain and nurture you in the decades to come. You deserve healthy friendships, and maybe even to be ready to date someday."
743,"People aren't thinking you cheated, people are thinking you were coerced"
744,"If this is how a referral from a friend gets treated, it does not bode well for the realtor's general clients....."
745,"don’t necessarily think it’s time for a full on freakout, but this is really dependent on your daughter. Does she have the knowledge and ability to call a neighbor, or 911, if need be? Are there reliable neighbors nearby who know the family? Is she anxious or unnerved by being left alone? Does she get up to dangerous stuff, like turning on the stove  or trying to light candles? 

Anecdotally, 2 of my 3 sons (ages 23 down to 17) were trustworthy at that age. I have lots of friends with kids that age now and that’s why I say it is dependent on the kid and situation. "
746,"Yes I want to, but most people would think this is a big commitment, so I want to make sure I’m not missing something. 

I would not expect her to pay me back, it’s a gift. 

I don’t know what I’ll feel like in 5 years, but I don’t think so. In the grand scheme of things it’s not a huge amount of money for me. She’s willing to move to a totally new country with me, so if we broke up it’d be more likely she would be angry she moved there with me, rather than me being angry about giving up 15% of my wealth to make her almost debt-free. "
747,Serena Williams was already at the top when she had her baby (not to mention 6 years older than OP's wife is now). Plus I'm sure being a multi-millionaire married to another multi-millionaire is helpful. 
748,I'm sorry this happened to you but why waste a whole year? Time to move on.
749,[deleted]
750,"Makes sense to me, either OP is super naive or she knows what the flowers are about and still brought them home which is a massive sign of disrespect to their relationship. 

The fact that OP is leaving out massive details like that though leads me to believe she knows what's going on but likes the attention and wants a pity party on Reddit cause she can't eat her cake and have it too. 

Not the best reaction from the husband but it makes sense. "
751,The second text isn’t so bad. The first text is almost unbelievably bad. Did you read this txt yourself?
752,"Like... how is OP even considering this woman come near her? Get a restraining order, block her, and unless you want your kid kidnapped or dead, don't let her near it."
753,"Congrats on the new baby!! 

This kinda reaction during childbirth isn’t uncommon, I’ve heard quite a few birth stories where the mother gets pretty angry and yells at her partner. It’s kinda like how people swear when they injure themselves. There have been studies that show swearing actually helps deal with pain. I think it’s the same kinda principle here; getting angry and shouting and insulting etc etc is a pretty damn fair reaction to the amount of pain a woman in childbirth is in for a prolonged amount of time. Maybe you could find a few examples of these stories, sit your wife down and show them to her? That way she can see that she’s not an awful person and it’s a pretty normal reaction, and why that is. Tell her you love her and you’re so proud of her and she doesn’t need to be forgiven for her mechanism for coping with the agony she was in. "
754,"Absolutely. I am definitely concerned about her 'crying and losing it'. Sounds like cause for concern about her, not suspicion."
755,You side with your wife and the mother of your children.  You have her back.  Period.
756,"&gt; I know in his head I am more important than games, but the way he spends his time does not reflect this.

A while ago, someone else in this sub was having a similar issue. I don't recall the exact details, but essentially she got her SO to list their priorities from highest to lowest and then track his time in terms of number of hours spent. Then at the end of the week they sat down and went over whether his time usage was actually reflecting his priorities (spoiler alert: it wasn't).

If you think your SO truly views you as important, this might be a good way to illustrate that."
757,"Get your shit in a basket legally because your wife sounds like the type to try to eviscerate you in court out of spite if you ever filed for divorce. You might say she's not, but do you really want to take that chance?

Once you do that, it's time for an ultimatum. You're in an emotionally abusive relationship. If this was one person talking shit about her then maybe they're full of crap, but if everyone agrees she's awful and you can even understand why they'd say so then she's probably awful. It's time to tell her exactly what you told us.

""I'm not happy. I feel as though you take your bad moods out on me, you're highly restrictive, I don't feel like an equal partner in this marriage anymore. Somewhere along the way I lost myself trying to keep you satisfied. There are things I need to see change, things I need you to work on and things we need to work on together if we're going to fix this."" The end.

Edit: Also don't be afraid to suggest a therapist for the both of you, either together or individually or both. This conversation is going to come out of left field so she may be defensive, but don't take the bait if she tries to shut it down. Tell her it's something you need to discuss and you're happy to let her process it but the issue isn't going anywhere."
758,He sounds like a fucking idiot. 
759,"You're mom is a manipulative lunatic. I'd take this over to /r/raisedbynarcissists

Your mom doesn't deserve forgiveness. Someone has to be sorry for you to forgive them. It sounds like she's never changed."
760,"I think you're going down a dangerous path with this line of questioning with your daughter. You asked some very leading questions. Your tl;dr is incorrect. You can't have a ""private areas talk"" with a 2 year old who is not yet actually verbal. Your 2 year old cannot confirm or deny that abuse has happened to her verbally. 

You could try taking her to a specialist to be evaluated, but without the ability to actually communicate, there will *never* be away of knowing if there was abuse through words alone. Although it's a bit crazy to put a spycam in the bathroom as another commenter suggested, that's much more likely to be able to prove anything. 

Are you fairly tech savvy and have access to your husband's computer? You could look through his files and internet history for child porn. If he has the TOR browser that's not a smoking gun in of itself but it certainly looks bad.

I think the real root of your problems here is that you've trapped yourself in an unhappy marriage so your husband can have citizenship. I worry that you are looking for a reason to separate father and child while remaining morally in the right. If you're looking for internet strangers to give you permission to divorce or to stop living with your husband, I'm giving it. Living with a spouse you dislike and distrust isn't good for you, your husband, and especially not your daughter. If he's not abusing her, you can at least salvage the co-parenting relationship."
761,"The whole ""you shouldn't have"" attitude towards gifts is an obligation that has gone too far in our society, imho.  It comes from a good place but I think this is an exaggerated version of that.

He makes very good money (it seems, from your post) and he wanted to gift you something very nice.  Gifts, by their definition, aren't ""necessary."" So don't focus on that.  They are the antithesis of ""necessary."" They are unnecessary acts of love/kindness, which is why gift giving is so wonderful. Don't focus on it being ""unnecessary."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Focus on the ""grateful"" and ""sweet"" part and tell him those types of things when you accept the gift :)"
762,"Yeah I once broke down ugly sobbing because I was tired and hormonal and my sister ate the last Twinkie I'd been saving. Sometimes ya just crack. She might be embarrassed about it now, which could contribute to the heavy energy. "
763,"My mom upgraded her engagement ring iirc with her own money for their 20th. I doubt my dad cared, he probably said ""looks very nice"" and didnt exactly notice what had changed when the new one came. She reused the diamond but it was a nice stone, all new setting. I actually have her old setting with a tanzanite now.

Theres always the DO YOU WANT A RING OR A MARRIAGE crowd on these posts but imo it's on your finger all the time, you arent happy with it, and you can pay your own way to change it. Go ahead."
764,Stop answering the door when he knocks. If he later says he knows you were home and isn't sure why you didn't answer the door you can tell him you don't like to be bothered while you're at home 
765,"Let your aunt and uncle handle this since they are the ones hosting / it's their house - If they abide by her demands, there's not much you can say. If they tell something to effect of  ""My house, my rules - you don't live here, you do not dictate what will be eaten here"", then you can tell your sister the equivalent ""Your personal problem, is not the whole family's problem - there will be dessert and you're welcome to not have any of it."" That's where it literally comes down to - what your aunt and uncle says."
766,It sounds like your friend is a people user and doesn't want to come to terms with her financial situation. She should really try to find some income of her own because she sounds like a begger. Not sure how long you guys have been friends what whatever the case honesty is the best. Next time she does this try telling her places that are hiring or give her the job listings in the news paper. You also shouldn't feel guilty as their is a difference between spotting a friend and being taken advantage of you work hard for your money protect it.
767,"THIS. Is he right in being pissed at them the next day because they got too drunk? Maybe. Maybe it’s a pattern. Maybe he’s just expressing his concern for them in an aggressive way. Maybe he told them to slow down drinking and they ignored it. Maybe he was having a great night and was annoyed that it ended soon.

But was he right in leaving them in the street to potentially be robbed, assaulted, get hypothermia, drown in their own vomit? HELL FUCKING NO."
768,"I don't get why people in here keeps suggesting therapy when OP clearly says he's not interested. Those advice are meaningless.

OP: *Does your husband want you to be stressed?* I'm going to assume **no**. So what does he express he can contribute with to alleviate your stress? What is his suggestion?"
769,[removed]
770,"Exactly. Weddings are really expensive and couples find weird ways to trim their guest lists. I personally have never known a couple to do this, but I have heard of the ""both-partners-must-have-met-the-guest"" rule, it happens.

OP, as others have suggested, be frank with your friend. Tell her you can't afford a trip but you would love to meet the fiance via skype. You guys can even plan a cute hangout, maybe you individually cook and ""have dinner"" and wine together and chat. If she says it is not good enough, then you may be right that the friendship is fizzling out. If your friend is completely unable to accommodate your lifestyle and budget, the friendship is unlikely to endure."

772,"You don't get to decide what he gifts you. You will definitely seem ungrateful if you do anything except say, ""thank you."" That's really just the long and short of it.

Stop snooping and being a scrooge! But Merry Christmas, lol

Editing to add a bit more here: you can't shut down and reject it any time someone does something nice for you because you think you don't deserve it or they should have spent their efforts elsewhere. It's poison to a relationship, or to a friendship, honestly. Part of being in a situation like that is accepting the other person will sometimes do nice stuff for you. You gotta work on that."
773,"You should speak to a lawyer. (And probably, to your mother as well. You should ask how this will impact her in the divorce, and what she knows about these loans.)

I'm not even sure he that transferring the Parent PLUS loans to you is completely legal. It's certainly not an intended use.

In your shoes, I'd even be a bit sceptical of him: Are you sure this is a loan related to your education he is trying to get you to shoulder? I'd be asking for the ""receipts"" and having my own lawyer look at them before I agreed to any of it. Your father now owes you complete transparency in regards to these loans.

And frankly, I would never agree to take on the whole debt. Your father was dishonest with you and now what you to accept the damages caused by his dishonesty. It seems clear that he had intended your educations to be a gift, and is now trying to get out of giving that gift because if the divorce. Out of sympathy and appreciation, I might split the loan with a parent in this situation, but I would never accept full responsibility for it. Your father made a choice, and a choice to withhold this information from you so that you couldn't address it or make plans with the full information. That was very, very unfair of him."
774,"If she's a drunk annoying mess, why did he follow that drunk annoying mess to a friends house and ditch YOU for that drunk annoying mess? 


I wonder what he is telling her about YOU"
775,Yeah you won't be able to convince her. She's going to carry this one until there's consequences and she's forced to change her ways. She's absolutely in the wrong but absolutely won't see it that way. Break up with her and go live your life. 
776,[deleted]
777,She doesn't see you as sensitive. She sees you as a push over and is using the language that her predator boyfriend has taught her to guilt trip her on you. 'No' is a complete sentence and she can strop all she likes but just stick to no.
778,"&gt; We've gotten into our roles of ""the fun one"" and ""the responsible one"" so much that I have no idea how to file my own taxes, pay mortgage payments, etc.

Isn't this exactly the problem? He has taken on the responsibilities to an extent where he can't loosen up anymore because someone has to be the responsible one, and you're afraid of doing normal adult stuff. I second counselling, but splitting the boring, responsible stuff more equally may help him realise he can sometimes relax too. "
779,"I'm so so sorry. 

Would it maybe be possible to go stay with your grandparents for a while? That would be less lonesome at least. "
780,"I hope you realize that you will always have to answer all romantic declarations with “right back at ya” for the remainder of this relationship, including proposals and wedding vows. Anything less would be a tragic waste. "
781,"It also sounds like he's hoping she'll still incubate some babies for him, out of the goodness of her uterus."
782,"My husband's grandparents and one of his aunts did this early on. On the upside he checked them on it when he noticed the ""core family"" stuff. On the downside they never did grasp why it was offensive. But they stopped separating my child from a previous marriage from the other grandkids. This is 100% something for the husbands to address. All of them. "
783,"Talk to a professional. My 2 year old, EVERY tome we have to change a diaper and clean her bathing suit areas, cries and screams, “ow! That hurts, stop!” I’m 100% sure she hasn’t been abused because I am with her 90% of the time, but talking to a professional is important "
784,"This is a typical abuse cycle, just FYI.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying this will lead to physical abuse (I have no idea). But the pattern of abuse is there, first he plays super nice, super attentive, teaches you, looks after you, probably isolated you from everyone else because ""he was looking out for you"" etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Then once you were in he started to show the real him. But you keep fighting for the first year him, thinking ""its not that bad, he's just busy, it will get better"" then you blink and its been three years and its been 66% bad and only 33% good. And those odds get worse the longer you stay with him. He may never hurt you, but its still emotional abuse. And manipulative as fuck"
785,"Very often when people who were abused, neglected or traumatised as kids have anyone responsible for that situation die, it unleashes something called 'complicated grief'.

This is a recognised psychological condition that is considered different to the 'normal' acute grief of bereavement. It is about grieving the death of someone who made you suffer, never getting the chance to change that relationship leaving it incomplete, having many unanswered questions as often traumatised kids do not have the same knowledge of their childhood and feel adrift when a caregiver dies because they have no memories to fall back on, only the 'truths' of the caregiver. 

It also unleashes the crippling reality that you now have to grieve the childhood you never had and often this triggers trauma responses such as PTSD that you had repressed for survival until this point. Also when people die they are often deified by others (mustn't speak ill of the dead huh?) and this completely minimises the chaos of your childhood so you feel utterly isolated and often realise your family will never believe your truth that the dead person did damaging things to you and you have lost them as well even though they are all still living.

Seeing other people mourn healthy relationships really emphasizes how painful and different complicated grief is. In trying to come to terms with my family trauma I just physically could not be around functional families because it was like being scalded with emotions. I'd go to the park and feel physically winded seeing a dad teach his kid to ride a bike or end up spiralling into a PTSD reliving seeing parents show how much they loved and liked their children.

I could not at the early points of my trauma work been around a parent-child relationship where the grief was about them dying not around their living. I was an adult but the tiny frightened damaged child I was still drove my brain and my adult body reacted like a desperate confused child. It made me feel freakish and useless and drove a deep deep depression and it made people judge me for who they thought I should be if I had had their childhood and adulthood.

Your GF needs a lot of support. She's experiencing her childhood sabotaging her adulthood and she needs help to disentangle them. you are experiencing the loss of childhood and move into adulthood. They are both painful to each of you, but yours is an expected if horrible part of growing up that needs support to allow you to heal from an acute pain on an otherwise healthy psyche that had resilience and ability to cope. 

Hers is a psychological injury inflicted on someone already at emotional capacity and not given coping strategies and the ability to develop before adulthood. It's like getting sick with a weakened immune system and no vaccinations compared to you being in full health and full protection. Of course you'll fight off the same 'bug' differently.

You have to decide if you can stop comparing when it's apples and oranges and try to understand that you could find common ground if you stop the compare and contrast tick chart you are doing. Eevryone grieves to different time frames anyway and this will obviously be different due to the timing and backgrounds.

You will never get understanding from your GF if you minimise her grief and force her to defend her trauma because that in itself takes up all her spare emotional energy leaving none for you. You both deserve support but you need to think how that needs to be shared out right now.

If you had a bad cold but your GF had a serious flu on top of another chronic serious condition would you expect equal care from each other right now or would you understand how it needs triaged to get you both through?

This is what complicated grief will be like and honestly if you can't try to help, you should break up with her because forcing her to suppress it and be what you need without understanding how intense this is for her will hurt both you. You'll end up resentful. She might end up hospitalised or suicidal or even dead.

I'd suggest you search out some grief counselling for yourself. Here in the UK there are grief charities and often grief support to do with cancer or hospitals or hospices that costs nothing. This can support you but it will also help you see what your GF is dealing with and allow you to see if you can support her in her crisis.

But stop seeing it as a competition and stop trying to parent her. The root of the whole issue is her complicated relationship with a parent who has died. Trying to step into a parental role simply reinforces and doubles down the parental grief. If you stay, start treating her like an partner instead."
786,Thank you.. I will probably block her soon. 
787,"Unfortunately, it's not you he would be targeting. It's not you he might start stalking, and it's not you he might follow somewhere until they are vulnerable. Guys dont do this stuff because they are comfortable with confrontation, so the risk of stalking increases.. And frankly, if it's your gf's safety on the line it's her call. If you were my BF and I found out you went behind my back for the ""public good"" and put me in danger, I would probably be angrier at you than the gun range guy. "
788,"Don’t call yourself a plaything, in any tense.

That was not ever something that *you* were.

You were and are a genuine, honest and good person who was serious about your love and all you had to offer.

Remember who you *are.*"
789,"Good question, and the best answer I can come up with is that Cliff isn't an asshole all of the time. That's what makes it hard. Because a lot of the time he is a smart and capable colleague to work with. He just has this....button, when pressed, causes him to throw all of that out of the window and behave completely erratically. 

It doesn't happen every day, more like every few months, so by the time it happens again, the previous outburst is mostly forgotten.

Going to management to rat him out is a big step, also because of the gaslighting thing. Cliff has this uncanny ability to make you seem like the crazy one when someone who hasn't witnessed his behavior asks what happened. In short, it's a risk. A risk most don't want to take, which means that if I go do it, I could be on my own, putting my job at risk.  "
790,"Frame it as a meet-cute! Serendipitously, you got set up with \*her\*, this girl you're head over heels for and have been with for three years. You were \*lucky\* that you got to meet and go out with your GF instead. 

Honestly, I'd feel a little weird too if I were in your GF's shoes, but, hopefully that wouldn't been quickly resolved with love and affection. Tell her how attractive you found her on your first date and how happy you were to have met her instead, all the butterflies you felt afterwards.

Possible wrench in the plan: do you still see this other girl often? Do you flirt with her at parties or flirt with other girls a lot? Does you GF have any other reason to feel jealousy?  "
791,"Please talk your bf about this, he seems like a genuine, wonderful, good person. 

I can just imagine his Reddit post. “My girlfriend seems unhappy in our relationship. I cook, i help with cleaning,  I treat her out to a date atleast once a week. I’m really trying to show her she means the world to me, but it doesn’t seem like enough”"
792,"Speaking of books, you should read Madame Bovary. It might be life-changing for you.

It's also really sad that the only thing you got from Pride and Prejudice is the fantasy of a hot, rich husband. The whole point of the novel was to show how stupid stupid these fantasies are, and how stupid it is that women collectively waste all their time and effort on gossip, chasing men, and trying to be as pretty as possible. And another theme of the novel is how society limited women to those roles - but you don't live in Regency England. You can work outside the home, have your own assets, make decisions about yourself and your family. You're not limited to fantasies to alleviate the boredom of your life. You can do a lot of things to make your life not boring."
793,"Girl, he is not ""overworked"" if he starts at 9 and is home by 7 with a two hour workout. That's not even an 8 hour work day!! I know his job might be demanding and stressful, but hell, I'm an aerospace engineer who is *at work* from 9-7 and I'm not too tired to give a shit about my partner. "
794,"He knows better, he's just trying to put it back on you instead of taking responsibility for his bad behavior. "
795,"&gt;when it’s your time it’s your time”

WTF? He thinks it is okay to say that to victims? This is a red flag that he is being so inconsiderate. "
796,"Another case of ""the grass is always greener"" in the books."
797,"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.   This is clearly the culture this family cultivates.   Think carefully about whether you can live with this, because it will never ever change.  "
798,"Only think I would add, is keep an ear out for ANY kind of bullying shit. just because you are in a place of seniority doesn't mean it wouldn't pull the same behavior on someone else.  have coworkers and superiors keep an eye out not in a retaliation type of way, but make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else type.  Good luck!"
799,"So she held you against your will, stole your dog, punched your partner in the face, pulled a knife on you both, and refuses to acknowledge wrongdoing?

I would be concerned about her interacting with baby. If she follows this line of behaviour shell probably shake it/put it to sleep with cough syrup/kidnap it/give it alcohol/leave it on its own for hours.

And it sounds like you did not get your dog back after all that!"
800,"&gt; and I've made the mistake of trying to be the cool step mom.

This is exactly the point I was going to make, but you beat me to it, OP. Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, Brittany made an unreasonable request, you politely declined it, &amp; now she’s throwing a tantrum because she’s still a teenager whose brain isn’t fully developed yet. You’re asking essentially how to maintain your reasonable boundary without making Brittany upset. You can’t. You either get to be the cool stepmom, who gets walked all over sometimes because she doesn’t want to upset a teenager - or you get to be the stepmom that wants to maintain reasonable boundaries &amp; respect, which means sometimes bearing the brunt of teenage attitude. It sounds like you’ve put a lot of effort &amp; love into forming relationships with your stepkids, which is amazing. But they’re still children / teenagers, so even the best of them will act shitty occasionally. You have to accept that it’s part of interacting with them &amp; isn’t a reflection of failure on your part. The 18-year-old is raised &amp; is going to act the way she is, regardless of how much you try to be everything you can to her. (That’s not to say you should roll over &amp; accept the shitty behavior - that’s just to say that it’s part of the territory. It’s not because you’re not being a good stepmom.)"
801,"Yes, all of her behavior clearly indicates that she believes that her bond with him is more important and she wants him to choose her.  She DOES NOT like you, OP, and is obviously projecting that onto how she perceives how you feel about her.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing really should be done.  Your boyfriend, lucky you, did the right thing and realized that shit went into crazy territory which is why he notified his boss.  Let him continue to handle it professionally through work channels.  The best thing to do is to keep ignoring her and making it obvious neither of you are interested any more.  I don't recommend trying to repair the relationship as she has no intention of being friends with you, only wants your man's attention on HER and not you.  Not a person you want to accommodate."
802,"No. You can't fake a happy family. If you don't feel ready, and your wife certainly doesn't feel ready, then you shouldn't go. I'm sorry that your mother has cancer. But she can and should respect the fact that her son sexually assaulted her daughter-in-law, and that is not okay. I would skip out this year, and make it up to her another day, but that day doesn't have to involve your brother now that he's estranged himself with your family."
803,"Here’s the thing: putting the money stuff aside, Frank seems to be making a sincere effort to be a part of your life. The fact that James is trying to be in the way of that is really difficult. To start, I’d sit and have a serious conversation with James. Maybe something like: “James, I love you and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me all these years. I wouldn’t be who I am without you and your guidance and love. The thing is, I’m curious to get to know Frank. He is my biological father, and I think it’s normal to want to get to know him. I want to have your support in this because you mean so much to me.” Or something like that, depending on your relationship with James. 

Secondly, as a broke college student, I can’t tell you to not take him up on the financial help. It’s absolutely a smart idea to accept the car or any other help he can offer. Life is expensive and his help is an amazing gift. 

I think the key here is communication on all parts!"
804,"Stop getting him gifts. If he’s 26 and doesn’t get that it’s the thought that counts, he doesn’t deserve them."
805,"You had an epiphany six months ago, spent a month going on bad dates, then met gay Bob, but have somehow been with him a year? Time machine aside, don't marry gay men who view you as a pleasant and convenient shield against their homophobic relatives."
806,"Agreed x 100. 

Story time: my mother had a literal psychotic break 2 years ago. My sisters and I hadn’t heard from her in a couple days, or on the usual days. We all live several states apart with mom in the middle. We were all trying to get in touch, then the call comes from my littlest sister; something was wrong with mom. 

Would I call and see if I could figure out what’s going on? Sure, so I call. My mom is talking about the devil, deals, vacation, marriage and the whole time having a complete separate conversation with my dad. Who at the time had been dead for 6 years (nearly to the day). I asked her point blank, “mom, do you know that dads dead?” She says in her mom voice (you all know the one), “of course I do, fgn15.” 

Then she drops the bombs that she’s been over to T’s house. T is a guy she fixated on after my dad died. He was a total douche canoe to her, but whatever, stalking is not okay. So, I start asking questions: “are you drinking again?” No! “What about any drugs?” “That was your father not me!” Okay, rule out alcohol and drugs. She’s still crazy talking on the phone about meeting my dad but T is the devil. Just straight crazy. So, I tell her to go sit in the kitchen and hang up. I call my littlest sister, and we determine someone needs to get her to the hospital while littlest flies home. 

Luckily, my aunt was able to go get her and take her to the local er. Mom became extremely agitated at the er and things spiraled from there. 

My mom spent 4 weeks hospitalized. It got way worse before it got better. Undiagnosed major depression can literally make your brain go on holiday. People in the middle of psychotic breaks can be at elevated risk of suicide and be a risk to themselves and others. 

If you can, I’d get her evaluated to rule out anything medical. "
807,"&gt;but I knew he was the one I wanted to marry from the beginning

&gt;we never talked serious about our exact future plans...

Wat"
808,I agree with the other poster- sounds like he’s not a fan of women. Pretty harsh &amp; immature to say that about vaginas- would be a dealbreaker if my partner dropped that line. Is your husband aware that just penetration is not going to make you orgasm? Hands at the very least need to be incorporated into your relationship if you’re going to have fulfilling sex. I think you can do a lot better I hope you see that or that you two can work through it. Sorry I don’t have any advice but good luck. 
809,"&gt; She thinks therapy is for nutters

Sounds like she'd be a perfect fit for it.

&gt; I’m literally sitting in a car in tears right now dreading going home

Before coming in to this post, I was about to say that you had one good friend in the bunch.  Turns out you have a bunch of good friends and a horrible wife."
810,yep is he having to make all the plans to get out from under the debt. like he tries to set down and talk about some things but she's just worked for 70 hours and is tired of it.
811,"Really, he should be leaving her.  None of this is ok.  If my mother did this to my father, I would absolutely tell him he needed to get away from her.  I'm a little alarmed at how casually you appear to dismiss your mother's behavior.  "
812,"&gt; What you got could’ve come from anyone... it's not romantic. Fruit and sunflowers are benign.

I agree with everything you said about the fiance’s anger and OP walking on eggshells to avoid it, but OP also kinda buried a lot of important info in the comments.

For example: Jason didn’t get anyone else a present. OP didn’t get any gifts from anyone else, and hasn’t bought any gifts for anyone else (yet - she says she’s going to). [OP says](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7pdmg/my_24f_fianc%C3%A9_24m_threw_my_gift_from_a_coworker/ec59zt1/?context=3), “Maybe he’s just closer to me than the other coworkers, who knows?“

The card Jason left with the flowers isn’t benign. [OP says](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7pdmg/my_24f_fianc%C3%A9_24m_threw_my_gift_from_a_coworker/ec58iqg/), “He wrote his own note that said, “Though you only make up a very small part of my life, your presence fulfills my eternity. Happy Holidays Ladybug.”  Ladybug is the cutesy nickname that Jason gave her.

People say that [OP has a “naturally flirty personality”. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7pdmg/my_24f_fianc%C3%A9_24m_threw_my_gift_from_a_coworker/ec4uxev/?context=3) Her and Jason don’t hang out, but they do “text every now and then”.

OP talks to Jason a lot at work, but doesn’t mention that to her fiance. [OP says](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a7pdmg/my_24f_fianc%C3%A9_24m_threw_my_gift_from_a_coworker/ec4r8n4/?context=3), “I’ve only mentioned him a couple of times and it was in general not directly. Jason is pretty good looking but he’s not single.“

I’m not in the slightest bit surprised that this present made the fiance angry. He certainly could’ve handled it better, and there is some indication that this isn’t the first time he’s shown this level of anger, which isn’t OK. But this isn’t a totally irrational thing. I’d be angry, too."
813,"Yeah, this. One of my best friends growing up is currently in a relationship with a man who desperately wants children, she desperately does not. She is lying to him so he will stay with her. I ended our 15 year friendship because of it. Some people are evil. Not saying this is the case with your wife, but I think you need to have a SERIOUS sit down with her about it.  It sounds like you are destined to be an amazing father, you shouldn't let anything stop you from that. "
814,"You can't save this marraige because she doesn't want it anymore. She is probably cheating, you don't need an excuse like proof to leave her. Get a lawyer and get out."
815,"Yes. OP, you get one life. ONE. "
816,"The kind where you're in the wrong if you don't do exactly what they're expecting even though they never let you know what their expectations are, and they'd rather make drama than productively tackle their problems.

Nobody should put up with that shit. It'd be bad enough if it was just one of them getting mad for not being a mind reader, but the entire family getting pissed is a big red flag that none of them can communicate expectations or resolve conflicts like an adult."
817,"""I named him Forrest, after his dad.""

""He's got a dad named Forrest too?"""
818,"Honestly, I have a pretty good idea. Mombots exist everywhere, not just the Midwest. Given a lot of women manage to have 3 kids, and work, and have their own activities, I really think boredom is at the root of your problem. 

Also, stop being friends with these people. They're bringing you down and making you think that this kind of lifestyle is okay. Dreaming of Prince Charming (whether a woeful misreading of an Austen character, Edward Cullen, or that dude from the smut bestseller) shouldn't be an outlet for a 30 year old woman, not to mention her main outlet. You don't need a man to save you."
819,Thank you for the comment. I have to fight to urge to engage with her. I want so badly to defend my boyfriend but I can see how it will make things worse. 
820,You made a huge mistake getting married. He is telling you point blank that he does not like or want your kid in his life. 
821,"I don’t think so. It’s just a place to live. If theres any rules you could be violating, just ask her in advance what they might be. Plenty of college students are 23 so i don’t think they’d think youre a weird old guy. "
822,"... that just hit me. You're absolutely right.
That's a very unique situation."
823,"You’ve been broken up for at least six months? Yes she’s going to sleep with other people. 

If your relationship can’t last through school, then it probably wasn’t going to last. You failed to put in what was needed. She failed by texting her ex. 

What happened while broken up is irrelevant here. 

If you got back together, you’d need to work on work/life balance, and she would need to cease contact with her ex. Your would need to be able to drop your feelings about her single sex life. You’d both need a better plan for next time life gets hard. 

Can you do all of that? I’m guessing you can’t. That means it’s over. "
824,"Girl take it back! He is 31 and wants to pout that you didn't pick up on hints!? If he wants something SO BAD he can buy it himself, he's a grown man! My fiance and I struggle to find gift for each other because when we want something, we go out and buy it with our big kid pants on with our big kid money.

I don't like him. Dump him. Gross!"
825,"The proof is kind of in the pudding on this one, right?  He told his ex that he loved her.  We're not taking platonic love here.  

He reached out to her in an attempt not only to cheat but to legitimately ditch you for her.  It sounds like what saved you is her having moved on.  

I think you know the answer to this one already unfortunately.  "
826,"&gt;we had something custom made to cover my sin bags

SIN BAGS! LMAO! Amazing."
827,"Getting angry is the wrong move. My mom told me I could and should come to her when I was thinking I was ready to have sex so she could take me to get on birth control, etc. So I did. And she lost her mind, and refused to take me to the doctor. 

The move is to be understanding and show concern. You want her to be safe and make smart decisions, and to understand the potential consequences if she makes bad decisions. Getting mad at her doesn't change or fix anything, and it doesn't teach her anything either except to not know if she can come to you if she fucks up and needs support. "
828,"There is no mental health issue that causes adult toddler syndrome. Leave him and don't feel guilty. If he wanted to stay in a relationship, he should have been a better partner."
829,"Ugh, no obligation, none.  The only connection you have with them is a few common genes - their parents ensured that you are NOT family in any meaningful sense.  And even apart from whatever kind of kids they might be, the stories they are likely to have heard about you would all have been very negative, so you would be starting off in a hole deeper than if you had been perfect strangers.  And that hasn't stopped - e.g., you have ""stolen their house.""  I wouldn't even recommend any contact - in any form it would just just open the way for that awful woman, her daughter's mother to be sure, to try to suck you in. "
830,"I think at this point she needs to just have a clear ""no touching my stuff"" boundary in place. The housemate seems to be struggling with the concept of asking/any sort of fair play so it will save trouble in the long run."
831,"&gt;I just wish she didnt brush this off as, ""o well, it happens.""

OP, if women let themselves feel as angry as we should about all the crap we have to deal with just for being women, we would collapse into a supernova of rage. What do you want her to do here?"
832,"Girl, you would have to be flat out nuts if you let her meet your kid. Like if I were your boyfriend this was my hill to die on. Her trustworthiness was never an issue. The real issue is can you be trusted not to rugsweep the entire thing and expect your boyfriend to do the same. The way you totally folded on letting her keep the dog matter and convinced him to do the same was a mega bad precedent to set. The face that you're already back to talking to your mom and never filed a police report also is bad news. Her bad behaviour has been normalised for far too long and you need to realise if you continue to do so she's going to damage your family (the one you made with your boyfriend). If you have therapy resources please go asap. This baby needs love, not a knife holding grandma who will 100% try to kidnap them."
833,"To be completely frank, her depression is not your problem. You should contact her friends and family so that they are aware of the situation. It is not your responsibility to maintain the happiness of a person, and her threats of self harm are incredibly manipulative and toxic. "
834,"Taking him, alone, to a therapist once isn’t going to change anything. You probably need to be seeking family counseling (if there’s ongoing abuse this isn’t a good idea) and possibly individual therapy for him as well. It sounds like at best he bottles up feelings until they explode."
835,"biggest red flag? Bf saying “they’re not bad people they’re just *bigots*”. And acts attacked. He acts attacked when you try to discuss being respected by his family. 

He’s FINE with this. He’s fine with their bigotry. Their unkindness. Their rudeness. And this is beyond “we like German!” This is “we don’t tolerate any other differences even if it excludes others. In fact we appear to take great joy in excluding others” 

Your bf is, I’m sorry, unacceptably shitty, selfish, and a supporter of bigotry. "
836,"I get that he was sent to his room for his safety in the moment. I’m just saying that I think it sends the wrong message. It’s your husband, your step daughter, and your son in the room. Your step daughter had a violent outburst, and he rushed to console her and sent him away. It’s going to make your son feel like he did something wrong. If he was in any sort of abusive situation prior it is DEFINITELY going to make him feel like he did something wrong. And your step daughter got what she wanted. Her dads attention all to herself. She should have been the one sent out of the room, as he did nothing wrong.

Honestly I think you guys need to come up with a plan where if something like this happens, violent or not, you go to her to talk things out first. So she’s not just left alone and feeling neglected, but also not getting that attention reward she’s after. "
837,"This woman is endangering your child. It’s sad that her life sucks, but that’s honestly not your problem. You absolutely need to fire her because she’s very close to involving your child in a serious situation."
838,"&gt; “I’m really hungry and nothing else at the table looks very appetizing so I would prefer to just eat this,”

That's a very awkward thing to say at a restaurant, because she would be at once criticizing everyone else's choices and the restaurant's cooking. If you weren't ordering family style, you shouldn't have tried to guilt her into sharing; you could have asked her privately why she didn't. You definitely shouldn't have called her out at the table like that, in front of your family. 

&gt; On the way I told her I completely understand her wrist issue and not being able to drive, but I would appreciate if she could be a little more flexible and open to trying something for the first time as everyone was inexperienced.

This seems like a pointless criticism. Did you criticize the rest of the people who were only interested in riding double, presumably for the same reasons as your gf? Why did you feel it was necessary to bring up at that specific time, when it was irrelevant and you were with your family? 

&gt; She refused to ask other for help and had to finish the last part un-assisted. [...] I raised my voice and repeated what I said.

Is it possibly because you keep squabbling with her in front of your family? That's a really awkward situation to be in when you're on vacation with your SO's family. And why did you leave her so far behind that you couldn't hear her - that's not a very kind thing to do to your girlfriend?

I'm not saying that your girlfriend should have hit you, but it does seem like you're acknowledging everything she did wrong but none of what you did.

Perhaps you should take her out, apologize for your part in all of this, and talk about how these fights would have been better resolved. For one, stop criticizing her so much when you are out in public. It sounds like she always has good reasons for the things she does, but for some reason you assume the worst of her when she's trying to save face in front of your family. "
839,"I have a difficult time giving advice about this, because I've never been in your shoes, and so I want to say, ""Just knock it off. When you want to do it, don't.""

However, I know that's no help.

I would recommend dialectical behavior therapy. It's pretty much made for people who can't regulate their moment-to-moment emotions and therefore act out. If you can't afford it/find it, order a workbook called ""The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook.""

Also, check out this subreddit: /r/AbuseInterrupted 

It's focused on ending abuse (both from the perspective of the abused person and the abuser), ending the cycle (ie when an abused person goes on to abuse), and such things. If I were you, I would repost this there. You might get some harsh responses, but I think you already knew you're likely to get some of those. And I think the advice you get there might be more nuanced or helpful than what you'll get most other places."
840,"This is the best move. Just stay quiet and let him talk. The more he kinda freaks out, the more you know. 

But really... it is 97% impossible for this to be anything else than what it looks like. Either he hid it and forgot about it because you were around or she left it for you. "
841,"Just answer the same way every time. Nope.  

Mom: “How was your day?”

You: “Busy but good, thanks.  Had a lot of clients today.”

Mom: “Oh?  Anything interesting?”

You: “Nope”

Mom:  “How old were they?”

You: “Nope”

Mom: “Where do they go to school?”

You: “Nope”

Mom: “What kind of problems do they have?”

You: “Nope”"
842,"That commenter may have meant it as a joke, but I think it's good advice. If they're going to treat you like shit, you don't owe it to them to keep their secrets and since they're too dumb to realize that, you should point it out to them."
843,"she's mad at him because of what ended up being an accident. Even if he was a jerk at that time, I don't think his intention was for her to seriously get hurt. 22 years is way too young to be holding onto such bitterness, she has up to 60 or more years ahead of her, any which time she could be hurt for any reason. "
844,"So the way you deal with it is to take it as a joke. Be sure to tell Bob how funny you and your boyfriend found the CD. You even played part of it at a party and everyone thought it was great! Very Will Farrel type humor, Bob! Thanks for the laughs, buddy!

If it was a joke, he'll love the praise. If it was romantically meant, it tells him there's no response from you and gives him a way to save face. He can lean into the joke part. 

"
845,"That’s SO much work for someone that doesn’t honestly deserve it. The password to her Snapchat? So you can what, add it to your daily list of things to do to make sure that your S/O isn’t trying to get with someone else?

OP I was young once myself. Let me tell you how this goes. The first two to three weeks will be fine. Better than fine. She’s gonna give you the full transparency and seem genuinely sorry. She’ll tell you everything you want. Slowly, it’s going to turn into “why do you always need to see my PHONE?” as the madness eats at you. You’ll start dealing with sunk cost fallacy because it’s been a year at this point and you think it’s “worth saving”. She’s going to grow tired of having to be so transparent and find someone else that she doesn’t need to do that with. The cycle will continue.

She’ll do it again and again. Even if you value the relationship enough to try to make it work, she doesn’t.

Break up. Never contact her again. Do it for your sanity.

"
846,"Oh sweetie. So the first thing I’m going to suggest is that you look into counseling while you’re at school. A lot of universities have therapists and other medical services right on campus. Please look into this because you’re going to need help remembering that you are not a bad daughter, that you’re an adult now and it’s totally normal and healthy for you to grow more and more independent, and you’re going to need help developing a “toolbox” of ways to establish and maintain boundaries with your folks. 

Going forward, the best thing to do is to try to separate from them financially any way you can. Phone, insurance, bank accounts, car.... anything they may be paying for can be used against you to try to clip your wings. If you can take care of them yourself or do without, they have fewer ways to control you. And then it becomes easier to maintain boundaries because all they can hold against you is being mad at you. Of course they could escalate and do things like stalk you at school or whatever but hopefully it won’t go that far, and if it does the law is firmly on your side. Hope that helps, good luck!"
847,"It's a shame - but I guess it shows me how much they actually care about our relationship, which was not very much. "
848,100% this! This is exactly what I was going to say. This was never about her being in control or dominant. This about him getting off on making her play a role that she didn't want to. I also wonder if he dislikes that she's made so many friends in the community. 
849,Well if he is not even willing to consider that he might be at fault、you should definitely be considering that divorce.
850,"So if she is as defensive as you say, she probably won't listen if you tell her the kid is behind. If it were me, I'd be trying to gently push her into getting the kid into some kind of Mother's Morrning Out program or other regular structured childcare at a reputable place 'to give her a break and let the kid meet new friends'. This will make the child's weaknesses in comparison to others more obvious and will also put her in the path of people who know and understand developmental milestones and will likely intevene on her behalf without you having to get directly involved (and will hopefully work on them while she is there as well). That is probably your best bet on making a real difference if she is in denial and/or stuck in her ways."
851,"&gt;His family were xenophobic assholes to your parents.

And to you, OP."
852,"Good advice. She constantly puts me down and then expects closeness. I am currently pregnant with twins and she told her 2 siblings before her dad and I had the chance to tell them because she wanted to be the first to tell them and not let us do it. I also bought her new clothes this year and when she moved in with her boyfriend she left a bunch of them on the ground with the tags still on since she didnt want them anymore instead of saying ""hey can we return these?"" I guess I'm just at my wits end with her and I've made the mistake of trying to be the cool step mom. "
853,He's 30. he's too old to not understand certain things. I would just...not see someone like this.
854,"“So, Dad, I see keeping your dick polished is more important than time with your daughter. See you when you want to see me. Have a nice life.”

Maybe without the first sentence. 

Toxic people are toxic and life is too short to put up with that shit.  

Family is who we choose.  Choose people that support you and leave the door open for people that should have your back come crawling thru. "
855,I like that idea. She must be absolutely repulsed and horrified by the things she learned about her husband of over a decade and hopefully we can all support her in a way that shows we are not judging or shaming her and truly want to help her rebuild a life without this piece of shit in it. 
856,"People process things differently. While coming from an abusive and chaotic background teaches you to survive, it doesn’t teach you how to thrive. When you leave the abusive household, and the abuse stops, it creates a vacuum. This is one of the most intense periods in that person’s life. Where they were so focused on just surviving, they now have all the time to actually process what actually happened. It’s like experiencing all the abuse again, but this time fully, emotionally engaged. It’s absolutely horrific. Your gf sounds like she’s been in survival mode for a really long time, and now that her life has stabilized,  NOW she’s processing and dealing with everything that has happened to her, and her father’s death was probably very triggering emotionally. 

It’s very, very encouraging that she has sought help and has continued with her therapy. It speaks to the strength of her will to live and her character. Trust, she doesn’t want to feel this way. She doesn’t want to be a burden. However, when it’s all you can do to get out of bed and breathe because the demons are constantly nipping at your heels, because it takes everything in you just to keep your head above water, she’s as drained as you are. She is probably facing the hardest fight of her life right now. 

I’m so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is so hard. "
857,"Okay. Well I'm just going to be straight up with you and say run. Run a fucking mile from his gaslighting arse!! He knew you were onto him so he tries to convince you that you are mental. That's classic gaslighting. 
If you don't run, he will never respect you. "
858,"Oh, hell no!  

Their mother threw you out of the home you owned.  Your father and Amanda obviously didn't make preparations for their kids' future in case they died (life insurance, etc...).  Those kids have almost certainly been poisoned against you.  

You owe none of them anything.  Amanda's or your father's extended family (siblings, parents, etc..) maybe willing to take on the responsibility but you don't have to even lose sleep over your decision."
859,"OP should really read this. Men like that arent worth a second chance, hopefully she doesnt stay with him."
860,Or they hit a headcount threshold and are pruning people.  Fiance says let's cut people we both do not know first.  
861,"Haha man this is so clearly what happened now you’ve spelled it out. They couldn’t be bothered asking her and updating OP, so now it’s OPs problem because they are actually angry at themselves. Pretty alarming to be honest."
862,Seems to me like he wanted to use you as interactive porn then got pissy when you enjoyed it
863,"You need to look at your state laws for issuing a check after terminating an employee. Don't go in and beg. That won't end well for anyone. 

How do you know mailing it means you won't get it for more than two weeks?"
864,"My heart breaks for you. I agree with your aunt that your sister came up with a poor solution to the issue. There's really not much that can be done, though. Your sister has to work out her feelings on her own, even if that means zero contact. You should really consider counseling for yourself. I wonder if grief counseling would help you deal with what is basically the loss of your sister. "
865,"Right now, no i cant...so i guess i shouldnt trust much of anything she says about not doing it again."
866,"You guys aren't happy nor sexually compatible with each other. No way to fix it. You're young, dump her and go find other girls to hook up with and have fun."
867,"Yeah I have to say that's very insensitive of him. I don't think you're overreacting because if you're too nice about this sort of thing, the shitty behaviour snowballs and gets worse.
Good on you for sticking to your principles."
868,"Honestly if they had told me specifically that they needed me for a ride on the day of the initial convo, I would’ve followed up myself because it would’ve been in my calendar right when they said “yes please pick her up.” 

The only reason I didn’t write anything down was because no one had even accepted my offer. It was sandwiched between several other ideas and seemingly forgotten about. I just assumed other rides were found."
869,"""Hey, I'm starting to get concerned about your friendship with [student] for X, Y, and Z reasons. Can we talk about it?"" See where this conversation takes you."
870,"He didn't just lunge at her and kiss her, he locked her in a room alone, cornered her, kissed her, and she fought him off and ran. Don't diminish her experience because you weren't traumatized by your own experiences."
871,"This is... deep. If I rang or called by my partner's place and they weren't answering because they were asleep I'd go, aw well glad they're getting lots of sleep. The fact that your SO jumps straight to assuming you were cheating is his issue, not yours.

Edit: if you really wanna try and prove yourself, check to see if Google Maps or whatever has your location history. But I reckon this is the kind of situation where no proof would be good enough."
872,"I was my best friend's maid of honor and I'd never managed to meet her fiance beforehand. We're just really busy and we live super far apart. We literally talk every day online, though."
873,"You can say ""It's always been creepy/gross/weird, I finally decided to start saying something"""
874,"You say ""No"".  This girl doesn't have a job, which means she'll move in with no plan to leave.  Also, she has no way to even pay for her own food or other expenses.

Your BF has to understand that all this girl needed to do to have all of her expenses paid for was go to school.  She probably could have done that part time and modeled part time and her parents would have paid all her bills.

If the closest person she can find to house her is an ExBF from more than 3 years ago, then she's already mooched her way through all of her closest friends and family.

He may be willing to be her next victim, but you shouldn't be.  It would be cheaper and less messy for him to pay for one week at a low-cost motel or hostel than to ever let her in the door.  And that's what you need to tell him.  ""I love that you're generous and can't see how this girl plans to use you, but if she stays at all, it will be difficult to get her to leave.  If you want to pay cash for a motel for her, I'm okay with that, but I don't feel comfortable letting an unemployed Ex come into our home and disrupt our safety snd comfort."""
875,"Take a breath and tackle this one issue at a time.  I understand you want to leave, but I'd say try and fix this first.  While my issues with my wife weren't as extreme, this sounds a lot like my wife before she was treated for depression and anxiety. 

While you aren't responsible for her mental health, seriously urge her to see a doctor about these issues.  Set up an appointment for her and go with her.  She sounds severely depressed.  Medication and therapy will turn this around 180 degrees."
876,"&gt; If I were that important to her, then I feel she would understand why this was hard for me and would have fiance talk to me on Skype or something if it were really that important that he see that I wasn't a figment of her imagination.

I feel like you've already answered your own question, you just need reassurance that yes, this doesn't make sense and no, it isn't a reasonable request for them to make. Frankly I'd be curious if there wasn't a money grab involved.

Plus it seems controlling to me. Whose idea was it *really* that wedding guests had to be vetted?"
877,"Harsh truth - if it was important to her, she'd make the drive down to you.

878,"This is exactly what I was going to say. ""Oh that's nice. Wonder who the father is."""
879,"&gt;My checking account is attached to my mother's overall accounts. She's going to see this... 

You're an adult, stop this immediately by removing her from your account or open another account and transfer your money into it with no access to her. 

Time to stand up and let your mother know you're an adult and you will spend your money however you see fit.

Honest, blunt and to the point. "
880,"&gt;my mom saying one thing all ‘sweet’ to my fiancé, then turning around and unloading her real thoughts to me

This is a manipulation tactic known as triangulation. Tell person A one thing and person B another, then stand back and take advantage of the ensuing discord. The person doing it, in this case your mom, doesn't always necessarily think about it so deliberately, but on some emotional level she understands that if you and your fiance are in disagreement then the heat is off her.

While I agree with others that you need to stand up for your fiance more firmly, I do commend you for recognizing that your mom is causing problems, which honestly puts you ahead of the game compared to a lot of people with manipulative parents. The pattern I see in your post is that your mom is able to drag you into an emotional argument repeatedly. On r/justnomil, they are sometimes fond of saying that parents know how to push your buttons because they are the ones who installed the buttons. I think that's what's happening in a lot of the scenarios you describe.

As hard as it is, I think your main task is to cut off the button-pushing. Be stone cold about it. If your mom starts guilting you about a pre-planned trip she agreed to? ""It sounds like this trip is upsetting you. Let's reschedule it for another time."" If she's talking shit about your fiance? ""If you are going to be negative about F, I'm going to end this call/visit."" Then follow through. Basically, you want to take your mom's  attempts to start a fight, and starve them of oxygen (attention). Bad behavior means reduced contact with you. Good behavior means contact resumes. Either you will train her to understand those consequences if nothing else, or if she doesn't learn, then you will at least end up excusing yourself early from a lot of emotionally charged situations."
881,"She needs help for her mental status at this point. I don't think you pointing out how horribly unhealthy this is will get through now. If anything, she'll add it to the book and continue to stew. Is there anyone she listens to or looks up to the most who could have a conversation with her? It sounds like she would greatly benefit from seeing a therapist. "
882,"Then ignore your ex-friend.  She made her choices, you've made yours.  I would continue by following up with the real estate company.  Complain formally about the realtor and her unprofessionalism that cost you.   CYA and to hell with your ex-friend and the realtor."
883,"Yeah, that's pretty suspicious. He's going pretty out of his way to appear single on social media."
884,"&gt; I'd wonder what these kids have been told about you. 

LOL, I've met people a little like the evil step-mother.  In all likelihood, OP was rarely if ever mentioned.  Usually these evil versions of step-parents would really prefer if the world would open up and swallow the step-children so there's nothing to distract the parent from giving them all their attention."
885,"You just say ""No, I'm not comfortable with that."" And then refuse to discuss it further. The answer is no. Nothing else needs to be said. She can give a million reasons, but all you have to say is no. She is being very rude and selfish. You don't need to explain that to her. Just remember that's she's pretty much a child acting like a child and you are an adult. She will not win this."
886,"Stop trying to appease your family.  You have spent (I’m assuming) multiple Christmas holidays with them, you have a SO and a whole new family to meet.  Plus if grandma gave me her blessing it’s case closed.  "
887,As long as this sub stays self conscious about the crazy ass advice it deals out sometimes then I think we’re in good shape lol
888,"&gt; At the same time, the money she has would be nice to use as a down payment on a home, although I would have to convince her. And her not wanting to be officially married means it wouldn't be mind anyway.

Whoa, dude... hold your horses there. It sounds like your girlfriend is not interested in legal marriage because she doesn’t want to combine finances &amp; specifically doesn’t want to share that $125k. Taking the sugar baby stuff out of it, she’s entering into the relationship with a huge savings, &amp; she’s not interested in that becoming a shared asset. So I wouldn’t go pinning any hopes on using that money to buy a home together. 

And I think that throwaway line is something you should really consider - that you’re jusging her pretty harshly for the choices she made but would be open to using the resulting money to improve your own situation. "
889,"Yes, and no asking for permission like a little child, either. F told her the earliest she could make it was 2 and then asked if that was early enough. Why even give her an opening to complain? Just say what you can do and leave it at that; it’s not a negotiation. "
890,"That last point is a key thing I should have put in my comment. Being in a lifestyle community can be awesome, if the needs of BOTH partners are prioritized. How much have you two talked about what you want?"
891,OP seriously he sounds like he has bipolar disorder. Nobody here is a professional but I have a cousin with bipolar disorder and this is exactly how she behaves. Is there any way you can get him in and get him some sort of help?
892,"I can understand not posting you on her instagram, which is basically a “business account” designed to make her appear a certain way and attract followers in order to get certain fashion benefits.  That’s not too weird. The part that is concerning is her not acknowledging you IRL as her boyfriend. At parties, etc.  That’s a real problem that signals she’s embarrassed or ashamed about *something* about you. "
893,"So say to him, ""we need to talk about a serious problem in our marriage. I am truly burnt out. I am exhausted and miserable, and I need your help. This is not something we can swipe aside, it is a crisis in our marriage."""
894,"That’s good! Glad you’ve been getting some useful advice. 

I personally think this would be the least dramatic option while still asserting yourself. You’re not feeding into his bullshit, but at the same time you’re asserting to your sister/his wife (who will obviously be more forgiving towards you anyway, as you are related) your boundaries. If you can get her “on your side” for want of better words, it’ll be much more effective than blowing up at him. Imo. "
895,"Plus what makes OP think he's not in danger too? If this guy is dangerous enough to show up at their house, angry over getting fired I say that he's more likely to get violent towards OP than her. Worse if he does have a gun. "
896,"1. You did right thing by going to your boss imediately. Directly to HR would also have worked, but you made the right call.

2. Mace is inexpensive and effective. If it's legal where you are, you may want to consider it.

3. Tell your husband what's going on. Sheltering him from the drama won't help him if there's a crazy person out there."
897,"She's being abused, but she's also an adult making a choice. If there's someone I'm worried about in this situation, it's you. Do you have anyone you can talk to about this stuff?"
898,"I don’t know if you being this callous is how you deal with the grief of losing your dad, or if you’ve always been this way, but this is NOT how a supporting partner should act. You’re making this whole situation about you. You are asking for emotional availability from her, but it doesn’t seem like you’re providing it to her, based on how you describe your relationship right now. People deal with grief in different ways, you can’t expect her to deal with hers the way you do. It’s not a competition. Perhaps you should try some couples therapy. It seems like you’re holding a grudge against her for not making the same ‘progress’ emotionally that you are. This isn’t healthy to say the least. "
899,"Exactly!

""I try doing non-sexual kissing without the intention of leading up to sex, but even that doesn't result in her wanting sex!"""
900,Breakup and learn details about how far this has gotten. Shes a pedophile
901,"Do you people not have managers at your place of employment?

Cliff's boss should be having a long talk about his workplace behaviors."
902,May I suggest you seek out a therapist for help with this. 
903,"Make your visits shorter.

Arrive on Christmas Eve, in the middle of the day.

When they hand you a list, scratch out the things you just aren't going to do, like your sister's bedroom.  Tell them you'll do X and Y, but that's it.  And try to conscript your sister into service.

When I visit during the holidays, I allow my mother to boss me around to a certain extent.  She's old and can't clean the house like she used to, so I figure it's either help her and still have a mother to enjoy Christmas with or don't help her and feel guilty that she killed herself vacuuming the stairs.  But I have my limits.  When she starts stepping over those limits, that's when I stop being so cheerful and easygoing, and then that's when she backs off.  It has taken me twenty years to learn how to be assertive without pissing my parents off, but that doesn't mean you have to wait that long."

905,"""Mom, I understand that you and Leslie are close, however sometimes to me it feels like you are more supportive of her than you are of your own son. I can't tell you who to talk to and I am glad you have a good relationship with her, but our relationship was very harmful to me. I am not asking you to not keep her in your life, but if you continue to bring her up in conversations with me, I will have to make some tough choices about my relationship with you."" Avoid JADE, just repeat yourself- if she respects you and wants to keep a healthy relationship with you, she will make changes to her behavior, and if she doesn't, be prepared to follow through. It's entirely possible that once you tell her how this makes you feel, she will ""snap out of it"" and change for that reason alone- she might just be thinking about Leslie's poor-me stories and not thinking about your feelings as a result."
906,"Hallmarks of a predator are seeking out young, inexperienced parters and taking on a fatherly role. He then introduced you to sexual activity you weren't interested in, and forced it upon you when you made it clear you weren't comfortable. He made you feel like he was a caring partner by saying ""We can take it as slow as you want!"" while shoving from behind. Now, hes gaslighting you about and punishing you for the situation he FORCED you to the middle of. You are married to an emotionally abusive sexual predator. "
907,You are NEVER going to be in a relationship where there isn't hardship or heartbreak or some pain from one of you. The fact that you see your partner in pain and the first instinct is to leave is sad.
908,"If you don't know how to tell your friend about her creepy husband, you can always make it about yourself and bend reality a bit.  
""Hey, listen, can you talk to your husband for me?  I know his jokes are harmless and I'm sure he means well / is trying to get to know me, but I'm always awkward with this type of humor and I'd rather not continue, but I don't know how to tell him that. Thanks for understanding me."" And then you show her the phone.

She can take it however she wants to, if she's smart, she may see right trough it, but if she doesn't, at least the husband may get the idea when she tells him about the ""jokes"".

910,I think the Father never thought about asking the money back. I think due the divorce something changed and something is also missing in this story. 
911,"So he can't remember the evening but is convinced you attacked him?


&gt; I don't know if I should try to make Mark believe me


This is the normalizing abuse thing people warned you about. The dude tried to slap you for talking about sex.


What's your best case scenario here? That he admits he attacked you and then what, you date again?



He's majorly gas-lighting you. It's really really hard to continue believing something if someone else just straight up denies it. You start to wonder, if they deny it maybe they're right? Why would anyone straight up deny anything that's plainly true? But people do it because it works! You're thinking it's crazy, you're a mess, you're wondering how to convince him.


Just because he's denying everything. It's a tactic. It's almost working."
912,"I really hope your son is in therapy too. Being in the system, or up and being separated from a family he once knew, is very hard. He has been through *a lot* before getting adopted by you guys. He’s trying not to be a problem. He’s keeping his emotions in. 

Your step-daughter just threw something at him and HE got sent to his room. He’s essentially just been punished double for opening up enough to call him papa. Think he’s going to feel comfortable calling him that in front of her again the way this went down? She got the attention she was looking for, and got her dad all to herself. She’s escalating the outbursts, and it’s working. 

Maybe she needs a new therapist. Maybe your husband needs the advice of a family therapist too. I’m a single mom (father not in the picture) with a son and he would LOVE to have another parent. He wants siblings. He could stand to have more friends and I don’t have many myself. I’m sure I am sufficiently screwing my kid up in other ways as one parent things are never easy, but I say this because in my experience and with people I know the sort of dynamic the two of them have isn’t the norm. 

The concern of her hurting herself is real. If she has given *any* indication she would do so in the here and now yes get her in somewhere. If it’s a fear she may escalate to that in attention seeking and this therapist still doesn’t care you need to get her in somewhere else this week. With more frequent sessions. 

EDIT to add: OP, you mention in your post everything your husband is doing with her. It may also help if you start doing more things with her too one on one. So it’s less like he’s a parent to two kids and you one and you are both a parent to both. "
