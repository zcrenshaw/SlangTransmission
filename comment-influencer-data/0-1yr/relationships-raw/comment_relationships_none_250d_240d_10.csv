6,"Either stop visiting her so often, or stop telling her about all the new things you’re doing. "
7,I've tried to point out my husband is telling during arguments and he insists he isn't as the echo rings back off the walls. Honestly some people really are just not aware of how loud they are when frustrated. They may think they are not yelling (which could be practically screaming for some people) but realistically are still above their normal volume.

9,"Just be honest .
I am really looking forward to the trip I am hoping it is just us can you can confirm my brother isn't coming ? Oh he is well I'm sorry but that's a deal breaker for me I don't want to deal with his issues we are on vacation "
10,"This! Don’t keep him in your life. I foolishly kept a guy in my life, were the story was almost exactly like this. Wasn’t very good for me or my heart. Today I see him occasionally because he works at my work, and there are no hard feelings. He has a very nice girlfriend and I’m married. OP, I’m sure you’ll meet someone great."
11,"I've read both of your posts. 

Break up with him now. He is not a partner you can rely in, and you clearly don't want to be with him."
12,"Agreed! Pills can and do help and for some people it’s necessary to get them to the point where they can deal with what’s going on for them - but it can also be used as a cover and a way of not dealing with what’s causing the depression/mental illness.

Not only could you get on the wrong meds/dose and deal with the possible fallout of that, lots of people have things they need to discuss/work through/heal/change that’s causing whatever is going on."
13,"Ok, first, take a step back and look at this from a little distance. To start, people masturbate all of the time, both in and out of sexually fulfilling relationships. Masturbation is in not  always an indication of your partners sexual competence, most people that I know, who are happy with their sex lives seem to masturbate more frequently than those who have not so great sex lives - both men and women. 

 Next, I dont know how to break this to you, but if you are a 19 year old boy, you are going to not only masturbate thinking about all of your friends, but also about all of your friends together at the same time, some of your friends moms, a bunch of your teachers, confusingly some of your guy friends sneak in there, theres that one chick walking down the street you saw with the erect nipples, like 2 hours ago, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the woman holding the gyro in that poster in every greek restaurant, etc. 

Realistically, there is no reason to be asking him who he thinks about when he masturbates. It is his private business, even in a healthy relationship, based on trust and honesty, not every detail needs to be shared. If he is good to you, if he treats you with respect, and care, and makes an effort to be there for you with all of the important stuff, then pay attention to that. I think he is kind of an idiot for over sharing, but if I had to guess, he probably did it in a misguided effort to share everything with the girl he cares for. If I had to guess, I'd imagine you have probably considered what it would be like to get with at least one of his friends. 

If he is coming to you with this stuff and flaunting it to make you miserable, then fuck that guy, but if this is a topic that has come about because of your curiosity, and nothing he ever would have brought up, maybe see if you can just accept that you dont need to know what he thinks about when he jerks off, anymore than he needs to know your private fantasy.

I am not suggesting you let yourself be walked all over, I am saying figure out what actually matters, and try to let go of the problems that dont need to be there. Good Luck"
14,"Most people on this thread have said it all but I’d still like to add my two cents. My mom is similar to yours, she grew up in an extremely religious country before moving here to have me and give me a better life. 

I do not believe your mom is abusing you. I honestly thing that’s a ridiculous claim. She has watched you grow and has molded you into the person she wanted you to become for 24 years. 

She comes from a place of love and simply cannot understand your actions, especially the extremely sudden change. Most people rebel in their teens and develop their identity over a span of years. In a single year you went through many perceived big changes (tattoos, Mohawk, shaved head.) 

While there is nothing wrong with shifting your identity and learning to be comfortable with who you are/aspire to be, this is a lot of rapid change. 

You compare your parents like your dad is better because he is a logical engineer. Your mom is coming from a place of love and love makes you do irrational things. 

When I expressed to my mom my interest in getting a tattoo, she didn’t talk to me and threatened to disown me. You need to be understanding that in our parents time, tattoos were the symbol of prison and drug dealing. 

You cannot make someone accept you, you cannot change their minds. They are set in their ways and that is something you need to accept. Give it a few years and she will come to terms that you are an individual and no longer an extension of her. "
15,"I don't have any advice for you on how to get over him, but if it helps for closure, I will say that as a guy who goes out on a decent number of 1st to 4th dates, I've realized so much of modern dating is up to fleeting whims. I really do feel that this is a byproduct of our Millennial generation. We have a hard time with dedication and effort because we're so used to instant gratification and if we don't get that, then having the convenient option to bail so damn easily.

I even have a current example I can use. I've been seeing a girl for about 2-3 weeks now recently, have gone on about 4 dates now and we've had sex twice, both really amazing (at least I thought so for both her and me). Overall, she's quite cute, funny, grounded, passionate about her career, and is interesting. When I'm with her, I try to be true to my personality, but obviously I'm not 100% my true self in front of her yet and am guarded. I admit that I do tend to say things I know what girls want to hear, even if it's a bit of a lie or exaggeration.

I'm not much of a texter normally, and even with her, it seems like things are dying off. From my end, the issue is she's a bit emotionally needy and that's not really something that I'm able to provide. I prefer someone who's fiercely independent and is looking for a man to be her adventure and life partner, but not someone who needs to take care of her or provide her comfort. I need someone who can be my equal.

So while things have been going great outwardly, in my mind, I picked on this one aspect and have let it grow to a point that I'm about to end things with this girl. While there's introspective reasoning behind my decision, from her position, it may seem like I just suddenly backed off despite everything going terrifically.

Perhaps you're in her shoes. Maybe that guy has been saying all the right things to you, but he doesn't really see you as long-term and is backing off. Going back to my first point, it's so easy for us to bail bail bail bail bail on dating nowadays given that we have access to thousands and thousands of potential partners at our fingertips via Tinder and other dating apps (at least for those of us in major metropolitan areas), that if you don't fall head over heels for someone, it's easy to just ghost and move on. Honestly, as I was reading your post, I felt like the guy was doing exactly what I do to girls I date.

That said, this isn't a guy thing. I have been on dates with several girls who I jokingly tell my roommate that I need to ""trap their asses"" (because they're totally long-term girlfriend material for me) only for them to back off and ghost/ditch/call it quits on me. Happens both ways, and I get it. This is what makes me sad, and it freaks me out sometimes when I'm thinking philosophically or introspectively that I may have dated someone who would've been an amazing wife for me, only for our relationship to not happen merely because one of us just didn't feel like responding to a message on Hinge or because while 98% of her/him was perfect, there's this small 2% that we just couldn't get over instead of working it through with time and effort.

-sigh- sorry for the long post. I'm feeling some emotion right now 2 am in the morning."
16,"I'm a guy, can confirm it's not at all a big deal "
17,"I know it's not cheating, but I was his friend before all of this and I just know how he imagined all of those things with those girls, I just can't stand it when we're together. Thanks a lot, I'll try to work on it. "
18,This is mild depression.
19,"If you dont have kids or shared responsibilities, 30 isn't that old to start over. People change with time. May be you guys have matured differently "
20,"One day you'll be in a position to put work off for personal events, but you're not there yet. This isn't just about doing something for your boss, but is about you doing something that could potentially benefit your working future. 

Ask if the ceremony or speeches can be streamed. Take a bit of time to send the couple a special gift and card. Even without you being present they'll still feel your love. "
21,"I'm not speaking for you, it's just a opinion that I hold. I'm sorry for your dad but in OPs case I feel like if they're not worthy enough to invite to your wedding, then don't come around to their funeral when they're six feet under either."
22,"Stop telling your mom everything you do, think, want.

Problem solved."
23,I needed to read this. Thanks. 
24,"I also suggest seeing a psychologist to get a professional diagnosis. Just be aware that it takes a few sessions to get a confident answer. I don’t suggest getting onto medications first. I have major depressive disorder and PTSD, talk therapy helped me more than meds did. In fact, most of my meds amplified my symptoms before I was just deemed treatment resistant. 

I know there is a term for not feeling attachment to people when they are not physically present, I just can’t remember the term right now. I’d look into depersonalization, derealization, and dissociation (NOT dissociative identity disorder it is a very different ailment). For your first session you should be prepared with how much you sleep on average, typical food consumption, and any stresses in your life esp if this is a new issue. 

If you ever do decide to go on medication I highly suggest having someone attend those appointments with you that is around you often. This is very helpful because meds do change your behavior and a lot of the time these changes aren’t perceptible to you. It helps a lot to sort of have a “med monitor” person to attend those appointments to inform the practitioner whatever changes they have observed. "
25,That’s the thing I just feel stupid and like I allowed this to happen because I felt like it started but then I checked twice and there was no blood so I assured him it was ok :/ 
26,"It looks like despite being atheist and moving out of the place that had traditional values, she is still clinging to the said values. I come from a religious background and belong to a country/culture that has the same values as the Middle East more or less. It seems like your mom is acting exactly how I’d expect people in my culture to act. 

She needs to remember she chose this life herself and this is what you need to be happy. She can’t move you to the US at that age and then expect you to act a certain way all your life ESPECIALLY when she’s not even religious. Like I understand being controlling is not acceptable in any situation. But it is completely unacceptable in this one. 

You need to tell her she’s just going to push you further away if she keeps criticizing and shaming you like that. If you can’t outright tell her this, let her get an idea through your actions. That she can’t control you and you love her unconditionally but you’re willing to maintain a distance due to her toxic behavior. "
27,"""I am an honest guy. I've never cheated on my wife ever. I also don't  want to damage the delicate chemistry of a bar by hurting the feelings  of another bartender by telling her to stop being herself.""

Which of these two do you think is most important?"
28,"It was his choice to throw them away. Women have been washing their own sheets for years from period leaks. It's not like the sheet was damaged. Does he throw away his sheets when he get a butt stain or ejaculation on it? No. He washes them.

I wouldn't offer to pay. It's the cost of having sex with a women."
29,what kind of doctor is your boyfriend?
30,It's probably not platonic and as such politely declining is the right call.  It's kinda annoying she felt the need to put the decision on you.
31," My boyfriend LOVES when I baby talk (I obviously never do it during sex) but the fact that I was doing it rubbed off on him. I don’t do it all the time but it happened. Anyway, he is a very manly dude so it made me cringe a little too. I just told him and he stopped. He wasn’t sad about it or anything. Just talk things out and get used to the idea that it is vital in a relationship. 

I really doubt baby talking is a HUGE part of his personality that requires major changes. If it bothers you, he can change it, or not, and that’s your cue to move on. Also, 6 months is a really long time to not have sex over something so simple, maybe use that talk to figure out if there are any underlying issues that are causing this. Good luck!"
32,"Thank you for the quote, and for including the author's name as well. Sounds like a beautiful book to read from. "
33,"I really think about it, he told me that he wants to even go to session with me, I attend to psychiatrist and psychotherapist so it would be possible. Thank you for reply. "
34,"&gt; but there are like a lot of girls who gush over him too

Yeah that's why he doesn't commit. He's 31 and doesn't lack young ladies.

You either bring something special to the table, or he'll pass. "
35,"OP, if it helps, I'm in my 40s and just did this with a guy my age too. It's not just being young. People tell you who they are, and you have to listen. He told me he wasn't sure he was ready for a real relationship again, and as I got to know him I realized he hasn't made time for one. His mind just isn't in it. The better I got to know him the more I liked him, and he would say things about how amazing I was, he'd never met anyone like me, sex was amazing, etc. But he still didn't *act* like he was fully into it. I called it off when I had enough of it.
If someone is into you, they'll say so. They'll ask when they can see you again, and pursue setting up that next date. If they don't...they're just not that into you.
It sucks. But there it is. This guy and I said we'd really like to be friends, because we understand each other's lives. But he never reaches out to me. I realized I have to stop reaching out to him, even as friends. He's putting in zero effort. Subconsciously, this is demoralizing for me. That's not even how friends behave - friends check on/check in with each other.  
Good luck, OP!"
36,"True, dating may make you compare people to him, but it also helped me get over mine. There are so many fish in the sea, and they're all a little different. You'll find others who work really well for you in different ways -- or even if they do remind you of him, they might be a better version for you, who actually sees and values you."
37,Assuming just makes an ASS out of U and ME. 
38,"Just tell him. Relationships are all about communication and figuring out where to go together, why not start now by telling him how you feel? I'd argue it's definitely a good time after 4 (assuming successful) dates."
39,"I grew up with a man very much like your husband, even when its not in front of them they can hear it, they can FEEL the tension in their room, im in my mid 20s and loud noises and confrontation still make me terrified, i cannot be in a relationship because i just dont trust men, I have zero relationship with my mother because of the resentment i have of the childhood she made me have because she wouldnt leave him, your children are already showing signs of trauma this is ALREADY affecting them, he wont change, ever, mt stepdad did therapy, anger management, meditation, stopping alcohol, you name it, nothing changed, please think of your children "
40,"Stop talking to him.  Go no contact.  It’s easier with FWB because you don’t even have to tell them, just move on.  Couldn’t be simpler. "
41,"""He has schizophrenia, but under therapy and medication. I also have bipolar with psychotic and schizoeffective features""

I'm sure that there's an enormous attraction between the two of you, but I'm sorry to say that if you choose to stick around, you will have NO chance of a stable life, ever. This relationship is an accident waiting to happen."
42,"Oh, man, you don't seem to be over your ex at all. Let him go already!"
43,"Wow it's nice to see it from your perspective. I was seeing a guy who was pursuing me. Then after the 4th date he just goes cold and doesn't respond to me. From my perspective, it seemed like he went from liking me to losing interest in one day. I still think about him mostly because I'm just curious about what could have possibly turned him off. 

I find it equally frustrating when a guy says things he knows the girl wants to hear if he doesn't mean it. It's hard for me to let myself be vulnerable enough to open up to guys. But this guy said and did all the right things. So when I finally showed some interest towards him, he started backing off. I think maybe he also didn't see a long term potential with me. But I just find it so weird that he would even make an effort in the first place if he didn't even see a future. "
44,"By their reactions you've described, I wouldn't worry about it. They seem to understand that this type of thing happens as a consequence of quality parties where booze is involved."
45,"He works 6am-6pm, 5 days off then 6pm-6am so it’s hard to fit the time in, then it was just Christmas etc so we were both busy over the holidays "
46,I have done this and it didnt go well. Basically accused me of being a hornball.

48,"I (36M) understand this 100% as I myself did this. I got married to my wife 4 years ago (been together 11) and we had decided that she would keep her birth name as I would mine. I didn’t want her to take my name surname. We had a child in 2016 and have just had another this year. Our children bear her surname, not mine. Last year when we went on holiday, I was stopped at passport control and questioned whether my daughter was my daughter because we didn’t share the same surname and I hated it. So a year long debate started (in my head) about what to do. Eventually I came to the decision to change MY surname to hers and our kids. It made the most sense. I spoke to her father, just like I did when I proposed, to ask his permission if I could officially become a “Smith” (example) and he was honoured and gave me permission. I spoke to my parents after that and quite frankly they didn’t really care! Just because my post says John Smith doesn’t change who i am, and I’ll always be John Jones to my parents. The strangest and hardest people to tell were friends. But once the reasons why were explained, they were all like “makes compete sense” and that was that (I told them AFTER I’d legally changed it though). 
It’s absolutely bizarre being known by another name now. When I make calls or book things, it sounds bizarre to say my new name. But like a new haircut, I’ll get used to it. And after all this is the exact thing that women all over the world have to go through. So why not guys? "

50,I mean I want to have kids with this woman she is my everything. But the fact thay we almost never have sex and when we do its extremely plain is just so frustrating. Especially when a young gorgeous woman drunkenly tells you things you wish your wife would. 
51,"&gt;how to move on from a 5yr relationship?

See the 5 years as a big lesson. Learn what you can from it and move on."
52,[removed]
53,"Forgiveness is good, but be ready to stand by your decision later if things dont work out.
You say you love him, if so then it could be difficult to ""exit"" the relationship. Sorry if I seem assumptious, it's just in my case breakups are hard even when they're necessary. In any case, I wish you the best of luck, here's hoping things work out!"
54,"No and no. Your parents are scumbags, mother included. I'd cut them off at once. Invite other members of you family to your wedding, but maybe think of hiring a bouncer in case mummy and daddy dearest try and crash the party."
55,"This 100%. 

Also one of these might be a possibility: 

1) Right now isn't the right time for him. Both people need to be mentally prepared to date, especially when the other person is looking to commit after such a short time. 

2) You came on too strong. Part of the allure of dating is the push/pull. If it's all give immediately, it can feel too easy and a guy doesn't feel like he won it. 

3) he's actively dating and more invested in someone else already. Like others have mentioned, relationships require each person to choose each other. Maybe you guys waited too long and the spark is gone, now there is just awkward what ifs and uncomfortable expectations. 

4) Something is missing from the story. Given the ""ok well, it seems like this has run its course. Happy new year"", it doesn't seem like theres a lot of direct communication or planning the next meetup. "
56,"Everyone has at least one night like this! You might be experiencing a slight case of hangxiety. Take deep breaths and, if your mind starts to plague you with horrendous flashbacks, let them flow through and remind yourself that 1) you WILL learn from this and 2) EVERYONE has been through this."
57,"The way you describe him doesn’t make him sound like a bad person, but there seems to be compatibility issues between the two of you. 

It’s not a bad thing that he’s unsure and unmotivated with his degree - especially if he’s unsure if that’s what he really wants to do - but from what I’ve read there’s a pattern of him doing poorly, then reassuring you he’ll do better next time then doing poorly again, rinse repeat. I feel like this will keep happening and it may very well branch out into other areas of your relationship.

Although you have these feelings of ‘true love’, it seems like in some way you feel as though breaking up may be the best thing to do; maybe a break might give you time to re-evaluate things. 

Trust your gut about this. "
58,Why would a (at least) mid twenties guy invite a 19yr old girl to come drink at his place ? Cmon.
59,"You sound like you’re doing great. If I were you I would space out the visits a bit more if they are only causing drama. 

I grew up in the US with an atheist mother who also cries a lot and gets upset over every decision that takes her children further away. She cried every time she saw us after we moved out for college, and both she and my father have made comments about tattoos (I have none, but likely will - they don’t know). Comments about drugs and alcohol and music. Sibling moved 1500 miles away but they’ll have to deal. Whatever. I just avoid talking to them about much of anything personal, and now in my 30s they may bring up those subjects, but they don’t expect the control/influence they expected before. My mother still gets upset if I call her out for being difficult, and when she gets upset I just avoid her for a bit. She cools off and will reach out again like nothing happened. "
60,"Wow respect to you sir, well played."
61,"Check out r/raisedbynarcissists. There is no dealing with them, writing a letter might make you feel good for a minute until she uses it against you. The best thing to do with these insane people is to cut them out or “grey rock” as much as possible. 

If I hadn’t taken my husbands name, I would have changed it anyway. I think you guys are doing something great for yourselves!!! "
62,"What the hell? This is beyond complicated its kinda ridiculous. You need to get you kids away from this crap before it gives them some totally unhealthy ideas of what relationships are supposed to be like. No i'm not talking about the poly thing i'm talking about all the lying and manipulation and greed going on that's all toxic af. Gather any proof you can that your wife is trying to dupe you, secure your assets and find a good attorney. Get a paternity test for the bun in the oven. "
63,"Just tell him it's not sexy you will care for him in a way that doesn't expose you to getting unwell this is not a bad selfish . You can tell him by not respecting your wish to stay well by him isolating himself which is infection 101 he compromised your situation at work and you feel like this potentially would have been avoided if he had gone home. This isn't that u don't love or want him but that he needs to be responsible and accept sometimes you will need to be apart illness or not.

My hubby when he's sick he tells me he stay in bed I hang in the lounge with the kids and vice versa I'm immune compromised so it's vital I stay away from infectious stuff "

66,"seems really harsh to break up with someone because of how they're doing academically. Like, ""what's that honey? you're failing your exams? Guess we're done."" that seems like a weird way to handle the situation. Most likely added pressure for him and didn't help at all. You said about how he's so amazing and you two are a perfect match, but you're fine with just leaving him if his grades aren't improving. Obviously if you want to end a relationship then that's fine. Just seems weird to say how perfect you two are and then threaten breaking up over his poor grades"
67,Yeah we speak every day. So hopefully tomorrow goes well. I just hate that grey area where you’re not sure what’s going on 
68,"Yep, my problem is that this are a lot of maybes and I don't know what is an excuse or not, because my trust is kinda of eroded when we come to this particular subject "
69,"They both have things to work on. In your example person number 1 starts the conversation on a horrible tone by being accusatory. ‘Why did you ignore me last night?’ automatically accuses person 2 of ignoring them so it already loads the conversation with negativity. If OP is expected to change the way he reacts, wife also should be expected to change the way she speaks in the first place."
70,"You are overreacting. From your description, you shouldn’t be surprised she has this kind of feelings for this guy, he has helped your gf a lot, but that doesn’t mean he’s the one for her. It obviously didn’t workout for a reason. It’s okay to be a little insecure, it’s hard to know that your girl has loved and been loved like that, but at the same time, she can say the same with you, right? I think, this is only a redflag in your relationship, if your gf did anything to cause distrust. But from your story, it seems like it’s just insecurities getting the best of you. You just need to get past it this."
71,Calling someone a derogatory name is not respectful nor helpful. Do you want to remain in a sexless marriage and be disrespected in this manner with your wife whom is not being helpful in coming to a mutually agreed to resolution?

73,"‘Why didn’t you respond? I’ve been calling you for ages. You could at least respond to my calling’ immediately starts the conversation negatively and directly accuses OP of purposefully ignoring her. That’s why he was frustrated - not because he didn’t hear her, but because she was accusing him of ignoring her and acting like he could have ‘at least’ done something he wasn’t even aware was happening."
74,"Honestly, I think you have said what you should say right here: ""The vacation would not be a vacation on our part if he were to come, and we would not appreciate the time we spend with my mother of family at all. He would take up all attention all the time and everything would be twisted to match his needs or desires. He would manipulate everyone to think what he believes and does is true and okay.""

I think you can soften or change the wording a bit if you like, but I think the  overall message is fair and clear enough. If your mother wants to enable your brother's behavior, that is very sad, but at this point in your adult lives, you need to look out for yourself in avoiding toxic people. You can be there for your mother in other ways, and certainly if she does decide she wants to work on her own issues towards your brother you can support her, but not at the risk of enabling an already unhealthy situation. "
75,"I know break would help us or decide whether we should be together or not, I will really try to do it, maybe by the time medicines will work. Thank you very much. "
76,"You're not wrong, it's not your fault, and if you want a peaceful and joyful wedding day, you should not invite either parent.

My dad is a narcissist and was very abusive to me. I didn't invite him to my wedding/semi-elopement. I love my mom dearly, but I didn't invite her either, because they're not sold separately. I was not going to begin my marriage with the sky-high anxiety my dad brings, nor was I going to disrespect myself or my husband by having him there. It was the right choice. 

Your parents - both of them - have spent your entire life manipulating you, stealing from you, damaging healthy relationships, justifying their shitty behavior, and generally being harmful. Your mom is an enabler and likely always will be. If you want a healthy marriage, cut the cord and focus on your relationship with your spouse, rather than on your conflicted feelings about your parents. I also recommend you seek counseling to help you sort through those feelings and to help you avoid repeating unhealthy behaviors you grew up around. 

"
77,"Thank you. 


I told myself yesterday that I won’t be messaging him again. "
78,"&gt; Maybe pressuring you to babysit is her way of trying to get you to face the reality of what having kids is like?

This was the first thing that popped into mind when I read OP's post."
79,"Your boyfriend hates gay people.

Personally I would choose Overwatch over a bigot "
80,Ya I actually kinda did
81,"This is scarily similar to my situation but I was 19. Honestly, if he wants you he'll show his commitment to you. Ask him where you guys are at, if he sees you the way you see him. He could just be doing the same thing he's doing to you to many other girls, just like what happened to me."
82,"/r/raisedbynarcissists 

Hey you, these are your life choices. Parents can be harsh, but everything that happens in your perceiption is YOUR decision. Don't let them get you down. U rock! "
83,"Yeah, I always just scroll through them all to clear the notification, doesn't have a deeper meaning hahaha"
84,"You can keep agonizing over this for the next 20 years, or until he finds someone else.

Or you can just ask him out. Your choice."
85,"Yknow, I never really got the whole “You’re alone yet cause you shaved your head” thing. 

As someone who’s missing a fair bit of hair from alopecia, I’m kinda curious what would’ve happened if you went bald from something like it. 

Cause, ya know, at the end of the day you’re still gonna be bald from something in either of those situations"
86,"I think the bigger problem in your relationship is you’re fundamentally incompatible. You want kids, and soon(ish), she’s pretty clearly told you she doesn’t. 

And you seem not to be taking seriously her stated desire to remain childfree and being dismissive or perhaps hoping she will change her mind or that she doesn’t really know what she wants, which is both insulting to her and a receipe for pain down the road for both of you. 

You say 

&gt; constantly when drunk/high/around other people brings up how terrible, gross, annoying it would be to have kids. This hurts my feelings, and I've brought that up before too.)

But this is quite a bizarre way to look at it. She voicing her personal opinions and desires about a huge life decision. She’s entitled to do that even if you disagree with that point of view. It’s not a question of “hurting your feelings”. She finds the prospect of having her own kids gross. If that upsets you, that only shows the core incompatibility between you two. 

"
87,"I mean, I agree with most other people here when it comes to the fact that you probably didn’t really get to know him so you’re most likely idealizing him because the things you /do/ know are overwhelmingly positive. And normally I’d say, forget him!! But, it seems you really like him and he really likes you. Have you ever been in a toxic relationship before? One where you’re heart is broken and you absolutely want to die? Maybe he hasn’t, but if he has—that stuff changes you! If you’ve ever seen your personal angel turn into the devil incarnate, it’s bound to make you have some trust issues and tread carefully in the future. Intense relationships gone sour could make the most open minded person very skeptical and cautious, because they have EXPERIENCED things that were good, turn into things that were too good to be true if you get me. But he likes you, and you like him and it seems that you’re both stuck on each other so I’d talk to him and let him know that there’s no way you can fully understand what his past and past relationships have shaped him and his trust into, but that you’re willing to wait and give him time. That you want to get to know him, as a person in his entirety—and work THROUGH those issues over time. Don’t be as emotionally vulnerable as before if you can help it, but I’m not sure this is worth letting go? I understand cutting things short before you become too emotionally involved but honestly you might have come off as a bit impatient...sorry if any of this seems rude! This is just the advice I would give a friend if she were in this situation."
88,it’s normal to have arguments especially when both parties are stressed.. it is a concern that you guys are dragging it out over a day though.. something trivial like this should usually be gotten over with or dealt with before going to bed
89,"Maybe for clarity she should relay the situation to her dad and see what his reaction would be. 

I doubt he’d be as chilled as either OP or his gf. 

Instructor probably plays this game every week with the new groups of girls coming to the slopes. "
90,It is illegal to report the wrong dob to the department of bdm such that it appears on an official document. That is fraud
91,"I agree. OP seems in a bit of a rebellious phase (nothing wrong with that). Maybe it’s the culture shock/excitement of coming from a middle eastern country to the good old crazy US and A where anything goes! Wooo! Tattoos and chicks and motorcycles and drugs and PBR and punk rock! Fuck yeah! Party! ...I digress.

OP should learn to conduct himself a certain way around his parents in order to keep the tension low. Keep it casual and relaxed. Tell them about how work is going, or about how he and the gf enjoyed a new restaurant or something. Leave out the part where he did jello shots off his gf’s freshly tattooed ass at 1am at an Anal Cunt show. "
92,"Mention it now, discuss how you'll go about it and ask how he feels about it. If this relationship is meant to be, you'll survive."
93,"Yep she's nuts.

No sensible parent would agree to their child being left with some person they don't know except possibly if they're a professional babysitter. Which OP is emphatically not.
"
94,"::ffffrrrrrrrppppppp:: ahhh, life's little joys"
95,"It drives me insane when people say shit like this to people who grew up with abusive parents. Mine were similar. Punished me constantly, controlled me, screamed at me, insulted me, hit me a few times. Ever since I moved out and am an independent adult they are sweet as sugar to me. Wanna know why and how this change happens? They have no control over you anymore. They cannot treat you like shit anymore but still have you around, so they begrudgingly treat you with just enough respect that you'll stick around so they don't feel lonely."
96,"It's more that she tells me she'll want to have kids one day just to keep me happy, but then at certain times the truth comes out.

She's allowed to not want kids, and I could maybe manage. But she's blowing smoke up my ass about something I care about, and that's not okay "
97,"This may seem a bit random, but if your sister has Facebook, tell her to check out the Subtle Halfie Traits page. There quite a few experiences there shared by mixed kids who grew up with one parent disrespecting the other parent's culture.

 I'm sure everyone else has given you ample advice in regards to the boyfriend, but what stood out to me was how disrespectful he was. I would hope your sister has enough respect for her own culture to not subject herself to someone like that, and allowing her to see other's experiences may give her something to think about. The regular subtle Asian traits page would also be relatable. Not advertising the pages, but I can tell you my cultural pride has certainly improved since I've seen the things shared there. Good luck!"
98,Well shit. My whole existence is a fraud. I’ve been using the later papers for everything and I can’t turn it back. 
99,"Ok I seriously doubt OP is going that far. The things she's flipping shit over seem to be more physical things, IE visible tattoos, haircut, etc. which you... Can't always hide."
100,"There are two separate issues here. Actually, three. First, there is the issue of your girlfriend trying to fob her responsibility off onto you. You are boyfriend and girlfriend, not one flesh. It is not your duty to take on the promises she's made.

Two (or issue 1.5), there is the issue of her trying to fob the care of a baby, something she presumably has experience in, onto you, someone who had no experience. It's not like you have to watch an 8 year old for a few hours, this is a non-verbal baby. I can't imagine the baby's parents would be very pleased to hear that instead of getting an experienced babysitter, they're getting some inexperienced shmuck (no offence). 

Final issue, your girlfriend is taking your lack of willingness to *babysit* as a reflection on your possible parenting skills in the future. Which is absolutely unfair. Just because you want to have your own kids in the future doesn't mean you're willing to suddenly take on the care of someone else's child, nor does it mean you magically are experienced with how to handle kids or babies. And apparently, because you don't want to babysit this child, I guess that means you're no longer allowed to be upset with her when she gets drunk and talks about how disgusting she finds kids. "
101,What is his ethnic background? What is your ethnic background?
102,I just go over there whenever he ask. At night 
103,"You have to meditate on not allowing external forces get too much energy out of you. It’s hard, J am also first generation American and my parents are foreign. There’s a lot I don’t tell them and plenty of times where my mother doesn’t like the things I choose, look like, acquire...etc. You gotta be you! I work in a jail, I write poetry about menstruation and sex, and I don’t want children or to get married! (I am a girl and 27.) You gotta do what you gotta do. Its stressful but you can respect/love your mother and still be who you are."
104,Choosing to be with somebody from the same country and background over an LDR seems reasonable to me. He sounds like he's been honest and not leading you on.
105,Bahahahaha of *course.* Much edgy. So edge. 
106," ~~Everyone~~ many healthy, committed relationships have these types of spats. "
107,"Well tbh I think I explained it wrong. Basically they went and filed a new birth certificate with my name and that’s the one I use. And you’re right, this is something I want to tell him face to face so I’ll do just that. 
"
108,Why are you so freaked out by this? Just show him this post and the evidence :) I am sure he'd understand. Being older than your boyfriend by a couple years does not make you a cougar! Relaaaax :)
109,"He's Indian, I'm a different type of Asian."
110,"This doesn’t sound like a marriage, OP. Even with the distance he should be making WAY more of an effort. It sounds like he’s still living like he’s single and childless. "
111,"The more you talk  With him the worse it will get especially since it should show that you knew he was 16. You need to stop talking to him now if he send you mail, you rip it up. If he send you other forms of communication you delete it. It is over between you 2 and the more you talk to him the worse it will look so now, you just need to stop talking with him and end it once and for all. That is how you will keep yourself safe in this terrible situation you can't do anything about the past you can only fix what is happening right now."
112,"Random girls, or attractive girls?"
113,She's one of my closest friends. Due to our schedules we don't see each other as often as we'd like to. She's married with a two year old son and another on the way. She has a full time job and a business she runs on the side.
114,"I talked already with her trying to confront her.

She told me that for her, the most important person is herself and she's not gonna feel influenced on what she writes by ""nobody"".

I answered that i am his husband and she should have talked with me before publishing to at least know which kind of impact this was going to give me, and gave her my wedding ring telling her if she thinks i am ""the others"" i am the only one believing in our marriage. 

She later on tried to go back to her steps and try to talk me but i honestly was too pissed to discuss again and didn't opened myself."
115,"Thanks, she's a pretty outspoken person. She has her moments."
116,"Yes, exactly. I guess the hard part for me, and maybe OP, was that he wasn’t that clear about it. (Wouldn’t really call it off) And that made me hope it would turn around for him. Should just have said bye bye. "
117,"The comment said that sex shouldn't be the only reason that you decide on a life partner. And that's true.

But you shouldn't discount it either. Sexual incompatibility is a really common reason relationships don't work out. In another comment you mention that when you tried to address this you got shut down harshly. If she won't even have a conversation about this with you, how can you expect it to get better? "
118,"Exactly this ^^.  Just open, transparent, vulnerable honesty. You just want to understand and help. As her friend, she should want these same things. I’m sure she will welcome your call. She must be feeling horrified and shocked too, if she is aware of the eventual suicide attempt. Are you thinking that they may have argued or something that led to the attempt? I’m not clear on why you fear she will feel attacked if you call her, unless you see their conversation as the cause of the attempt, instead of what was more likely: the calls were your fiancée reaching out for support to her bestie.

120,"&gt; This already happened twice.

Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice ....."
121,"I remember when I was super burnt out at work. I decided I was going to be a dental nurse, because I like having my teeth cleaned. It meant a huge paycut, having to retrain...probably never getting back to the wage I was already at, so all the lifestyle changes that come with that. I got to an interview before I realised wtf I was doing and pulled my application. It wasn't actually what I wanted, I just needed to get out.

So what I'm saying is, and without meaning to be totally condescending, are you sure it's that you want to be a flight attendant or are you just not happy where you are now? Because if that's the case there are alternatives. I went back to Uni and did the right course that I should have done first off, and have now had some amazing work experiences. Which would never have happened if I just jumped out the first window I found. "
122,This post is so weird. The fact that your gf called all her exes up to confirm that she’s not a bad person is beyond bizarre. 
123,It’s part of the wife package- bitching and nagging is apArt of the deal. 
124,"You had a realisation and acted on your feelings by going to her. I think that's a healthy outcome in this situation and I'm glad you were able to act in love and do that, rather than act as an individual scoring points. Don't listen to the cavemen here telling you it should've been a bigger fight. The advice about ""I feel"" statements up above is gold."
125,"&gt; what should I do?

You ruled out breaking up with him, so the other option is to accept that he does this and not let it bother you.

Personally, I'd go the break up route."
126,"You got to live for you and not worry about your parents. This is your life, not theirs. Their part ended when you became a legal adult. I understand you love your parents and care about them and their approval, but you can't base your decisions and your happiness on other people's opinions. We get one life - have fun with it! :) "
127,"Oh definitely a really complicated situation, I would be very anxious about it too"
128,"Thank you all so much for the advices, I am feeling much safer and better on this mas will talk to her as soon as I come back. Love to you all!!"
129,"How old is your baby? I'm a mother of a 9 month old and I'm just going to put my own perspective here. Babies change everything! I've been with my husband for just over 3 years, and since baby came along I have to dedicate 99% of my waking hours to her. I rarely get a break, as I breastfeed still. I find it difficult to prioritise myself, let alone my husband. We joke that we feel more like housemates as we tend to only have one meal a day together as I have to plan breakfast and lunch around my baby and her naps, so I find it easier just to do my own thing with meals apart from dinner when she's asleep. Sex- what's that?! 😂 Luckily we have good communication, but I have so much insight now into how babies can break a relationship. It's not their fault, obviously, but their needs ultimately come first, and this is tiring beyond words. I spend too much time on my phone which I want to change as I don't want my baby modelling this. Sounds like your wife uses her phone as her escape to relax with possibly? Definitely talk to her about this, she needs to know how you feel. Maybe even show her your post. Talking is the only way to sort this out, hopefully she'll open up for you. "
130,"I think it's time you drop the pretense that she 'maybe' wants to have kids someday. You obviously already know that she's only saying this to placate you.

Your GF is being absolutely unreasonable about this babysitting situation, but that's not even close to being your main problem in this relationship... "
131,"Sorry that their obviously idiots , you think they’d support you knowing your situation. 

Take some space if your concerned , stick to talking on the phone ... maybe they’ll apologise for being so silly "
132,Divorce this asshole
133,You should've never married her. What were you thinking? She planned to sleep with someone else and  you just sweep it under the rug AND marry her? \*Internal Screams\* I don't want to be rude but she sounds pretty terrible and selfish as hell. Why do you put up with her? 
134,What about the sake of your partner’s happiness? While it’s unhealthy for partners to hold each other back it’s similarly toxic to just act selfishly in spite of your partner’s concerns.
135,Most men are sexist and should grow up then.
136,"I have two friends that are flight attendants. They are single for a reason. The pay sucks, they are rarely home, and the hours are physical rough. Yes, there are the perks of travel but most of the time they are in one place for less than 8 hours and they end up getting wasted or getting up to other dumb stuff. They aren’t actually taking in the history of the world. I’m 35 and they are around my age and they have a lot of flight attendant friends that I would consider “kids” so it’s just an odd vocation overall.  Reality vs Fantasy on this one.

I think sometimes when we get stressed out in our lives it’s easy to start thinking about jumping ship. If you already have a fiancée and you are considering having a child, the last thing you need is a career change like this. It will pretty much blow those things apart faster than you think."
137,"I know there's more than two ethnic background in Asia.

I guess I really am naive, but I was willing to work to make it work. Again, naive probably. He's told me before that his parents were okay weren't too strict on who he wanted to marry as long as he was happy. 

We were together in person more than he has with this new girl."
138,I came here to suggest this as well. Sounds like she needs some mental help to help her get through these 'wrongdoings' in her parenting. 
139,"I agree with the poster below, flip the story and see how she feels.   
Say you had lunch with your ski instructor and you were both having a playful bet with each other that she won and said she wants you to go to her house for a drink. There is no way in the world she would feel comfortable with any of that, from you having lunch with her to the obvious flirting - having jokes / bets. I think she is just immature and enjoying the attention and not realising how hurt if you had been hanging out with a female instructor all day. that obviously had the hots for you.  "
140,"At least not with a very clear incentive. OP, if you want to go this route, then set a deadline and clear rules and be prepared to take drastic steps if he doesn't follow through. "
141,"As a random stranger who is not a witch, a 7 month relationship at age 18 is probably not your final destination.  So what?  Don't do anything that has a permanent mark (get pregnant) just enjoy life."
142,"If you don't want to see her or them you don't have to - that's entirely fair and your decision. As they've apologised this is hopefully a fixable situation, just try and remember it's entirely their problem, their stupidity, their anxiety. You don't have to cater to their worries, you don't have to convince them of anything. They bring up your weight at all, you can just say ""I don't want to discuss it"" and change the subject. If they keep trying, keep shutting them down, or just tell them if they can't drop it you'll leave. Because this is none of their business, even if they say they're ""just concerned"" or similar. It's **their** problem, and you are under no obligation to discuss it with them. They can't drop it and act like adults? Then you'll leave/hang up the phone/whatever.

Just because they've apologised, that doesn't make what they said OK, and it doesn't mean you have to entirely forgive them. If you're still on edge about it and bothered by it, it may be you need to bite the bullet and tell them that their baseless accusation really hurt you, and has made you want to be around them less. Whether they're sorry or not doesn't magically make you feel better about it instantly - if you need time, take the time."

145,"In this case I’d say it’s not insecurities it’s just bad feelings about your gf going to the home of a stranger, she definitely should not have been doing that, crazy."
146,"Wait? So.. Has she been with him, fucked on several occasions and you took her back before? She seems to be a lying scumbag. Ditch her. "
147,"Thank you, that made me giggle"
148,"Staying in a relationship that has been making you miserable time and time again will continue to make you miserable. Breaking it off will be hard and will also leave you miserable at first, but one day you'll realise it's the best thing you could've done. Focus on yourself, do some soul-searching, learn to respect and love yourself and things will get better. You might think it's not possible, but it is. Trust me."
149,"She was appreciating the attention. Willfully clueless. Agreed that it's frustrating that she put it on you, but in that circumstance I wouldn't have a problem putting my foot down and saying I wouldn't be happy about her going. 

He 100% had bad intentions and didn't give a fuck that she has a boyfriend. Dudes like that have no respect"

151,"Honestly, I think you should break up with him. You are very young, relationship-wise, and you need to focus on yourself right now, rather than sorting out insecurities whilst in a partnership with somebody you don't trust.   


You don't have to be okay with him masturbating to your friends, but to try and change him would be unfair on both of you, as well as extremely difficult. This isn't worth the energy."
152,"100%. You also texted him, “it seems this has run its course” instead of telling him how you really feel. It isn’t shocking that after thinking this is your idea of the relationship, he agrees. That’s a lot of hot and cold going his way. "
153,I don't think that will solve any problem - op would still be unconsciously condoning moms actions
154,"You did the right thing, keep contact to a minimum until she’s gone from your life and then block forever. You’re worth more than this."
155,"I had this same problem with my mother until I finally had enough. I pierced my ears and she literally told me that I was dead to her. I stopped talking to her for a while until she “apologized”, she was just saying that I was to blame for her behavior. The only advice I can give you is to not give a damn. I moved out of my country and I couldn’t be happier. She is not thinking about you, she is thinking about herself. She is manipulating you, don’t let her. If she cuts you out off her life for “your” choices, let her. I love my mom to death but I would never allow her to control me ever again. I would rather not have a relationship with her that not been able to live my life."
156,"The only problem I see is you want to change her perspective.  And guess what... that’s not gonna happen. Those things you describe are contrary to how she imagined, and probably contrary to how most 40-60 year old parents imagined. 

So you aren’t going to change her. The best you can do it tell her understand she doesn’t support your lifestyle but you still love her and hope she can continue a relationship without her constant drama about your choices. Let her know you aren’t going to change so it’s up to her to decide how she will deal with it. "
157,"Just interested: After what amount of time, would you consider ending it if the other is not willing to commit still (and you know you want a relationship)?"
158,"You are, of course, right, but I don't undestand why the onus of defusing this is on OP exclusively.

She is starting with:

&gt; “where have you been? I’ve been calling for you for ages! Why aren’t you responding? I started panicking. You could at least respond to my calling?” in a loud and frustrated tone

Were I OP, what I would hear is not ""I love you and was concerned about you"". I would hear ""you are a bad, inconsiderate person for not hearing me when I call you"", which _of course_ makes him defensive - she is attacking him, for something which he arguably can't even be held accountable.
"
159,"You need to make sure you report this to the university ASAP because this girl is a manipulator and can twist the story however she wants, if she’s left alone with your boyfriend there’s potential that she could make a false allegation for rape. 

None of these ideas are mine, I gathered them from sub-comments which I’m not sure you would have seen and I think it’s very important that you see it. I take no credit for this. "
160,"Yeah, the telling you things are fine when they aren’t isn’t okay. But it is expected, given that you do seem to be a fair bit overbearing on the subject. It would definitely seem easier just to tell you it’s all going okay rather than being honest. 

If you want to stay together for all other aspects, this is the only negative, then stay with him. It will be hard with him moving away anyway, and if you need the guarantee that he’ll find his “path” soon (you’re both still really young, there’s plenty of time for this still), then split now before it becomes a scenario where you’re clinging to loose strings. You’d both be happier, and at the end of the day that’s what matters most."
161,"Whaatttt. You're kidding. He doesn't send you any money?

I'm going to say something very harsh here. Guys in the military who are married get certain perks that are supposed to go to their wife and kid. Extra money, live off base, housing allowance, more holiday time etc. 

I think he married you for the military perks. You need to divorce him and then sue him for alimony and child support ASAP."
162,"She knows why you are cold and distant but most guys will change their behavior before confronting a 23 yr old about *their* trashy behavior.

And yes, hitting on a known married man is pretty much the apex of trash. I would steer clear from someone who's morals are as loose as their legs. Prime spot for STDs. 

You also haven't done enough to fix your own marriage. You have suggested things...but have done nothing? Start going to counseling yourself if she wont go. You will get better advice about her. Actually *do* things that you think will help and communicate with her about it. Start fixing yourself(or do you honestly think you need no self-improvement? Because you are flirting with gross little girls lol) 

Put effort in.

Then, if the effort isn't matched move on from your wife, but I still suggest avoiding that girl haha"
163,"&gt; Because we're the closest of friends, I'm gonna keep contact with him and still support him, which is gonna hurt really badly when I know he's with her. 

So you’re choosing to subject yourself to this pain. Buddhism says suffering = pain x duration

You guys aren’t even in the same country. Let this one go."
164,"Where is the line when it's ok to objectify *any* other human? I've had instances in the past where I discovered that female friends were masturbating to pictures of me (I'm a guy). You *could* say that those female friends were objectifying me, but I wasn't offended...why? *Because we're all humans with needs and it's not my place to tell people what they can and cannot think.* As I mentioned before, the problem here is that the guy did it without privacy.

&gt; Would you feel the same way if one of your guy friends was masturba(t)ing to pics of you in a public area of your home?

Interesting question. Let me show two different sides to this question...

&gt; ""Would you feel the same way if one of your guy friends was masturba(t)ing to pics of you?""

No. I wouldn't feel bad. Objectifying me doesn't make me feel bad, especially to friends that do it in privacy because my friends are good people.

&gt; Would you feel the same way if one of your guy friends was masturba(t)ing to pics of you **in a public area of your home?**

Yes. And I already said that this is where the problem is. This is not about objectification, this is about where the man chose to do it...and that is where the disrespect is."
165,Sounds like a bit of a wanker to me
166,"Work on yourself, instead of giving up and staying in a bad relationship. Therapy could help, joining social activities and pursuing hobbies might help you as well - staying stuck in the same situation over and over won't get you anywhere."
167,"Whatever it it, he's gone and does not deserve your time. You don't need a man who flakes on you, and gives up on you before it really started. He will not come back to you. He's wasting everyone's time by fantasising about a guy who has moved on with his life while another guy shows interest and would be willing to invest his time on you.

He didn't have to text you back, nobody does. Sometimes no closure is the closure. Sometimes a guy will just be there for a short ride, then go on without you knowing he doesn't thing you're the one he seeks."
168,He knows I want to date him.... as far as the ex.... did you read where he told her I was dating his friend.... and that he’s not sleeping with me. Why lie to her? 
169,"Balance what exactly?

He treats me well, overall. He's a very good person. Very sweet and fun and good natured. He's had an overall positive impact to my life, despite evidence to the contrary. Most of the time I am satisfied, happy, content. 

It just doesn't fucking last. He is not without his faults and so things fall apart quite regularly. He makes me want to be a better person. I just don't know how. 

He is a very patient person, except when it comes to change. He is quite adept at change and tweaking his personality. He says he doesn't expect me to be the same way. But I feel he does bc he gets frustrated when things like this aren't instant..."
170,"she didn't ask me for money. In fact, her exact words were "" WHY woud you tell my mother I needed money??"" and my reply was "" I didn't say you wanted or needed it, I just wanted to make sure you were going to be able to finally do this financially, and I wanted to help if I could."""
171,"    Was it that you were hoping it would ""fix"" your singleness
No because I was happy before we met, I was just interested in meeting someone. I guess there was some loneliness which is why I started looking in the first place. Aside from that I wanted this breakup because I wanted to be alone again."
172,I can't except naivety as an acceptable explanation - she knows full well the connotation. I sense she's testing the waters or perhaps has insecurities of her own and enjoys knowing OP would be jealous/insecure in that situation.
173,"I think its fair to say nearly all men have thought sexually about women they know who aren't their partner. I know many women find that shocking but I don't think I know any men who would find it particularly weird. 

Someone once said women are tourists in the land of lust, men are prisoners. I think there's some truth to that.

However I think she should dump him because only a very stupid man would actually let on to their partner they're thinking sexually about their partner's friends."
174,"Just tell him. Do it now. Also 2 years is not that big of a age gap. This insecurity you have about your age, being 2 years older than your peers, is really nothing you should care about. "
175,The dish washer is. But otherwise it's 50/50 who fills and who empties it.
176,"Honestly, I don't know what you expected. I have my experience with mental issues as well (depression and now anxiety) but your partner is never your therapist or responsible for your mental health. You are relying heavily upon your boyfriend and apparently aren't really giving enough support/not the right kind of support for your boyfriend in return. This imbalance is really damaging to any kind of human relationship so I'm guessing he probably can't carry all the weight anymore.

You've already acknowledged that you probably need therapy, which is good. Apart from that, try to see your boyfriend's side a bit more. Ask him what exactly you can do to support him, what he'd like to hear during the bad times and if you can't agree on something, you should reconsider this relationship. It's not a healthy dynamic for either of you."

179,"Have you been hospitalised for your mental breakdown? Was it a mental breakdown if you are here posting this? Did you call your therapist on an emergency line? 

I don't see  a mental breakdown here and I don't think it's to be used lightly. 


Your boyfriend doesn't seem to be a medical or mental health professional, so why are you calling him instead of a professional? Surely you can give his number off later to be contacted once you are hospitalised. 

Or am I getting this wrong and you are using your boyfriend as an emotional crutch for your breakouts not breakdowns."
180,The movie *The Big Sick* had Kumal Nanjianis character expressing to his conservative Muslim parents about the frustration of them moving to America for a better life and expecting things to be just like in Pakistan still. 
181,"There’s no way to do this where you don’t tell your wife about your needs beforehand if you really love your wife. 

Imagine you were in her position "
182,"I'm trying to understand.

I don't often vent to him about my feelings at all. I don't go on rants about him. I keep mostly to myself and take most of his criticism in stride. I've never tried to say anyone was responsible for my mental health - these mental breakdowns are actually incredibly rare for me. But it would have been nice to have the support in my moment of weakness. 

I did even say I tried going to various other friends before going to him - which he actually usually gets mad at me for. He usually gets angry if I DON'T come to him, but I also DON'T want to burden him with my problems so I often DON'T come to him. 

I try to support him the best way I know how... I give him everything I can think of. When I do ask him how I can support him better, he tells me to do what he does. When I ask him to elaborate further, he gets visibly angry and snaps at me to ""forget it"" because I'll ""never understand""."
183,"All of this is super strange. I have exes I'm still fond of and exes who think I'm a horrible person. But I moved ON. I can't control what they say or what they think. I can either stand behind my actions or I can admit mistakes in retrospect. But it seems like she's super invested in what other people think of her? People from ages ago who she never interacts with? She has to make her own peace with whatever happened with the nasty ex, rather than expecting external validation. 

Some guy who is fond of her (his idea of her when he dated her) from across the world isn't a threat to you. He never committed to her, never made an effort to be a permanent part of her life. She never made an effort to commit to him or be a permanent part of his life. Let it be. Enjoy your time with her and show her that you love her in a real, concrete everyday way, not a fantasy. "
184,"Whether he cared or not is irrelevant. 

That is relevant is that he was at work. Him working supersedes your controllable emotional state. You’ve already stated he takes good care of you. How does that happen ? Going to work. 

 "
185,"Your girlfriend is being naive, or maybe she likes the attention. This is a situation where she may start out innocent but getting drunk, her inhibitions will be lower. The instructor knows you exist, but doesn't care. I would have her talk with her dad about this for advice about how it looks, because he isn't so naive. She really has to learn to protect herself better, because she can't just blindly wander into these types of situations."
186,"Taking care of me doesn't mean financial support. I also work and take care of that myself. I do not expect him to financially support me at all, by any means. "
187,"Why don't you pay the whole thing? You wanted equality, and now you got it. You don't get to cherry pick all the benefits and leave all the burdens on men. "
188,"Congratulations on being amazing and getting into the top uni!!! This mom is proud of you. Go forth and live your life to the fullest. Do all the things!! Just be safe, wear your seatbelt, &amp; don’t forget a sweater...I don’t want you to get cold! "
189,If you aren't doing anything wrong and your boyfriend is too insecure then you probably made the right call and should date more mature men. 
190,You’re a disgusting person and I hope your wife catches wind of this and divorces you. You need to seek professional help.
191,"Thank you for this. The next day she drove to my place to talk again and an attempt to understand my mind and get over this hump. She says she wants to fightnfor the relationship and asked if there was anything I could do, to be fair, and I left this out before, we were emotionally dating at the time and not official (her Dad needed time to think about it) so I couldn’t put a label on our relationship because of that at the time.

I took her back since I saw her sincerity and honesty to try to save the relationship. She didn’t want to even be friends with the dude again, she said that she did her part and she help him so that’s that.

I wish I saw these replies sooner, my decision would have been different. My plan is to vet her extremely now, and to slow our relationship down. We put back up boundaries and I apologize for my shortcomings and told her that the past is past.

I recognize that I may be making more foolish mistakes here and if I am, please correct me. I may be blinded by my emotions but I don’t sense any deceit in here actions, she hasn’t ever told a small white lie to me before.

I will soon post an update on how things go. Right now, I’m watching for any signs and praying to God"
192,"Yes, this is silly obvious.  

I may get downvoted for this, but accepting an invitation to drink at a guy's house who you barely know is like walking down Malcolm X Boulevard wearing a giant Rolex at 3am.  Sure, it isn't your fault when something terrible happens, but you certainly are making it way easier for bad shit to go down.   "
193,"Your manager sucks at her job. Trini should be shutting down that shit. Why is she just sitting there taking it? 

Am I missing something or did you list a manager who is sitting there for this and is doing 0?"
194,"Leave, what an asshole."
195,Hopefully your wife finds out 
196,"If you are financially dependent on them then..well that sucks. You don't really provide any insight of their characters to even guess at advice for speaking with them.

Unfortunately if you cannot communicate with them and depend on them then you are in a tight spot.

I suggest moving out so that you can make your own decisions. It's time to leave that nest."
197,"&gt; I’m not worried about her cheating as much as I’m worried about the fact that she was still debating 

The world of women dating is weird.  As a dude I don't understand it well either, but there's always some calculation behind the scenes of ""I know this is creepy and weird, but if I say no, will that put me in physical danger?"" "
198,[removed]
199,"As a woman, I definitely have thought about pretty much every guy I’ve met sexually. Not necessarily wanting to jump in bed with them — most of them not, actually — but I’ve at least wondered or postulated what they would be like in bed. This happens whether I have a partner or not. 

However, there is a world of difference between thinking about someone you know sexually and masturbating to their social media photos. Thoughts come and go, but masturbating to a picture/fantasies of that person requires action. At that point you’re just leaning into the attraction and, in my opinion, disrespecting your partner. "
200,"So according to the sidebar rules:

&gt; No gift or activity questions

No, this is not the right place to post this.

No one here can possibly tell what your SO would like, because we don't know him even a little bit, and if you don't know what he'd like, how could any of us?"
201,"Is it really that bad?! I’m usually good at reading people and this seemed so out of character for him... I‘ll try to be more careful, thanks. "
202,"I completely understand how you feel. My parents are also Middle Eastern and freak out about the smallest changes, I remember my mother freaked out because I looked “just like a lesbian” when I cut my hair a little shorter. Just like your parents, they aren’t religious yet they’re very homophobic, so it’s gonna be this huge ordeal when they find out I’m actually gay.

It hurts to see your mother suffering, but at the end of the day, there’s not much you can do if she’s stuck in her ways and unable to adapt to the changes you’re going through. You need to experience life, and you aren’t doing anything wrong by wanting to travel and live your life to the fullest while you still can. 

From what you’ve shared it seems like your mother’s disapproval over your lifestyle is the only thing stopping you from enjoying every experience to its full extent. No matter what you do, she disapproves and I understand that all too well. But there comes a time where there’s nothing left to do, sometimes you just can’t change people. No self-help book is gonna change somebody stuck in their ways, and unwilling to change.

It’s probably not much help, but things became so much easier for me when I reminded myself that it was MY LIFE. And as much as my mother hates my choices, my choices make me who I am. Your mother is heartbroken, not because of your choices, but because of her inability to adapt and accept you as you are. And as emotional and upset as she is, nobody dies from disappointment."
203,"Is this really that bad? I think I still have to talk to him about what went down but I‘ll be careful, thanks. "

205,"Thank you. I don't want to do anything to their friendship, I need to know how to cope with it internally and this helps.

I will never be someone who says ""you can't be friends with x"", I do trust him and I don't think anything will happen without him telling me but I struggle to cope with things being in the hands of a third party, that if she changes her mind he'll be gone with no warning. If the anxiety it causes becomes too much I'll break it off rather than dictate how he spends his time, but I'd rather try and tackle it than end an otherwise potentially very good fit for both of us because I'm jealous.

We spoke about it briefly earlier this week, in which he said he'd only told me about his earlier feelings because he wanted to be completely honest with me and ""the only threat to us is my mental health"" (he's had problems in the past, I've had far more severe ones but had a lot more treatment and am generally better now than he is, and he's not been doing great the last couple of weeks as it's the one year anniversary of him watching a different best friend die traumatically - not unusual in our hobby, we've both watched friends die)."

207,"Ok, so you're definitely not in the wrong here. It's unfair to expect you to take care of a young child when you're not comfortable with it. 

However, I can see why your girlfriend may be upset. She might feel that she does favours for you, and finds it unfair that you're not reciprocating. You didn't mention in your post what time she had to babysit - if it's in the evening and they're in bed for most of it she may feel you may not have to do much. 

Maybe try to explain to her that you're not trying to avoid doing something for her, it's just that you feel you wouldn't be able to keep the child safe."
208,"Do you do other things with your wife? Cuddle up and watch a movie? Rub her feet/back/whatever was hurting her that day?  Hold hand? Physical contact that isn’t sex? If not, that maybe a place to start.

Is she on birth control pills? Has she switched them or anything recently? I know when I wasn’t on them when we were trying to get pregnant I was so much more into it. Now, I have been taking the pills again and I can tell a huge difference in my libido unfortunately. 

The girl sounds like trash. I think if you want to work on your marriage, stay clear of her. "
209,"It sounds like he wanted to be cool with it, and probably thought he could be, but then when faced with it in person discovered that he couldn't be cool with it.  It happens.  We all want to pretend to be relaxed and chill but there are things we actually can't be relaxed about when it comes down to it.

It sounds like he handled it poorly, but it's not that surprising that he's uncomfortable being in a relationship with someone as close as you say you are to an ex.  It's also not surprising that at this point, if forced to choose, you'd choose your old friend.

I think it's good he revealed it this early on - you can break up and find someone more compatible who truly doesn't mind."

It doesn't sound like this is a new thing, either - she  obviously just feels differently about physical affection. Does she mind a hand being held? Maybe compromise with something that isn't as overt as a kiss.

An additional thing to ask in relation to the bedroom stuff: you have to initiate it, but is she usually receptive? If so, you have nothing to worry about. If she loves you, and still wants to have sex, then she clearly just isn't in to initiating - maybe she just has a lower sex drive, and doesn't think about things like that until you bring it up."
215,"I love my boyfriend so much that I can never imagine doing this. I would be so hurt if I was your wife? If she doesn't forgive you, would it be worth it?"

220,I do really really want to tell her but I feel it's something more private to me
221,"In this post I haven't seen anything for him to be insecure about. You've only hung out with Ben in groups, you don't spend all day texting him. You were upfront about everything and introduced them to each other. At the party your attention was on Chris, not Ben. It's obvious you and Ben are platonic. I don't see anything inappropriate with what you did. If it ends with Chris then it's not because you chose Ben over him, it's because Chris kinda torpedoed this new relationship by his insecurity. 

For what it's worth my wife's ex of 2 years is part of her close friends group. I don't care because like you and Ben, it's obvious that it's platonic. Hell I'm friends with her too. It doesn't matter who you dated before as long as it's obvious that nothing's going to happen again and neither of you want it to"
222,"That was a very unpleasant wakeup call.

Your reality is that your husband is using the fact that he's married with a kid on paper to run a frathouse apt. He's the coolest guy on base, with the fun fuckpad. Meanwhile he has only seen his child three times and pays nothing to raise his kid. 

That's not a marriage in any real sense. He's not being a father in any way. You love him, but he is just using you to get an apt. and other extras. 

Can you imagine how awful your life would be if you uninvitedly crashed his party? His friends would be trashtalking you all day every day as the meanspirited woman who ruined their fun and took away their frathouse. He would have no loyalty to you. You'd have no support and no friends. 

You need to start getting child support and just continue building a life for yourself and your kid where you are."
223,"This isn’t a great option either, though. My grandmother did this sort of thing with me with one or two foods I wouldn’t eat, and I wasn’t a very picky eater. What it did was help morph into an eating disorder for me because it helped teach me that if I could control nothing else about a situation, I could control my food and what went in my body because I would not eat for days rather than eat whatever she was trying to force me to eat and that control carried into my adulthood now. There are definitely kinder and more appropriate ways to handle this especially when it looks like OPs sister might have a weird psychological relationship with food already. "
224,"It kinda sounds like you're asking him to subsidize a fantasy job that'll take you away for long periods of time within the first six months of your marriage and, most likely, make trying for a baby (your current plan) much more difficult.  Is that right?

At the end of the day you can do what you want, but I for sure see why he's not excited about the idea."
225,"You need to leave it be. You are your boyfriend trying to “comfort” her is only going to add salt to the wound. It could also give her some wrong ideas and give her hope that she still has a chance with him. 

As long as she’s not posting anything that indicates she’s going to physically harm herself, let her go through the grieving process. "
226,"Dude it kind of sounds like your girlfriend has broken up with you and moved out to be with another guy and just hasn’t gone through the formality of telling you. She’s not even answering your texts anymore!

Hell no you're no overreacting - if anything you are underreacting. She’s playing you for a fool."
227,"I think the husband is very much in the wrong here, however the son asking to talk to his dad is not necessarily a sign of a lack of contact.  I live with my husband and he does the full morning routine with our son as well as part of the bedtime routine.  My son that is the same age as OP's will randomly ask to call Daddy while we drive home from daycare approximately once a week.  "
228,"How can you “fall in love” after just one date?? Falling in love requires getting to actually know someone over a period of time. You’re only 19. You have plenty of time to find the right person for you. It doesn’t have to be every girl you date. Honestly, you should date, a lot. This is how you figure out what you want in a relationship and what you want in a person and trust me it takes a long time for that. IMO , date and have fun with no expectations . There’s no rule on when you need to be in a serious relationship. Don’t get offended by these girls opinions of you. Remember, they are doing the same thing, trying to figure out what they want too and you just might not be it at the moment. One lesson I learned is that you attract what you are at that moment. "
229,"I‘m just sad that he wasn’t honest about his feelings with me. I understand that being close to an ex is a stress factor in a relationship and that’s why I wanted him to talk to me if something bothered him. 

I just don’t want to choose. Chris and I had an amazing connection and it feels so wrong to leave it behind. I really thought we were compatible. But Ben has been my friend for so long and I cannot lose him over something like this. "
230,"My mom did the same thing when I moved out.  She tried to guilt trip me into staying because of selfish reasons.  I flat out told her she needs to grow up.  Stop harassing me about it or I won't visit again.

This stopped pretty quick after she thought I was joking.  I told her, every time she does this I'll double the time I spend away.  Now it's up to 1 month.  It's been a year or so since she last bothered me about it.

On the bright side, our relationship improved. "
231,"I masturbate to nearly every attractive woman I see, coworkers, friends, whomever.  no, it doesn't make things awkward or make me want to cheat."
232,"It's possible, but I fear you're looking for zebras; if he were into OP but had other things going on, he'd likely at least say something along the lines of ""Hey, I've got this other thing going on but I will get back to you at [time]""."
233,"You are being an ass. I realized I wanted to do sex stuff with other people, but didn't want to lose my partner, so I talked it over with her. We are now into the fifth year of an open relationship, where we both get to screw around, and so it's all good. You, on the other hand, are not only going behind her back, but also going to do it with people who know and respect her? This not only shows you are being deceptive, but are also being really stupid about your deception; there are just so many obvious ways this could go wrong. In addition, you said she'd even be up for a threesome - do you really think putting your penis in another person is going to feel any different when your wife isn't there? You literally have the opportunity to get what you want without deception, and you're still planning on choosing the path of an ass."
234,"&gt; I know no one here will justify my actions and most will say talk to my wife and arrange a threesome. 

I sincerely doubt most replies will."
235,"&gt;I‘m just sad that he wasn’t honest about his feelings with me.

I don't think he was dishonest with you.  I think he genuinely thought he'd be fine with it, and then, when seeing a lingering hug, realized he wasn't.  It's perfectly normal to think you feel one way about something until confronted with it.

Listen, life is a series of binary choices.  It's perfectly normal for Chris to be uncomfortable in this situation, but building a relationship with someone uncomfortable with this while maintaining your friendship will simply lead to more heartache and pain and make things worse when either your relationship or your friendship with Ben ends.  It sucks you have to choose, but you and Chris have incompatible priorities and boundaries."
236,Are you sure you're in a relationship?  If she doesn't say she misses you and you're not even seeing her off at the airport...
237,i think the first suggestion is solid . baking a cake is nice too. but i would pop over and let her know if she needs anything she can call . that’s nice if you. 
238,"Understand your concerns. Your sister’s diet is severely lacking in diversity and nutrition. It also sounds like your parents have given up. 

I know some kids get picky and that it’s a control thing. If you think about it, what they eat is one of the only things they have control over when they are little, but 11 is too old for this I would have thought. 

Clearly it’s not an aversion to textures or tastes if she will eat ‘normal’ food out of the house - it’s an indulgence thing.  Your parents have indulged her in this behaviour.  However, making a scene over her eating may not help at this stage. 

My cousin was extremely picky as a child. It got to the point where my aunt had to make him different dinners from the rest of the family. She got so sick of it that in the end she would put dinner on the table. If my cousin wouldn’t eat it she didn’t make a big deal out of it but she would be clear that that’s all he was getting - if he didn’t want to eat it that’s fine but he wouldn’t get his own special dinner. 

After a week or so my cousin realised that he was no longer getting special treatment or attention for being a picky eater and got so hungry that he gave in and started eating with the rest of the family. 

Maybe it’s worth trying this with your sister? Clearly your parents have to get on board though and if they won’t then there is little you can do - she is their child after all but enabling these poor eating habits is not going to help in the long run and hopefully they will listen. "
239,Couples counselling isn't about blame. if things are as above the counsellor will likely get some insight from your wife on it. There's no harm in trying it  
240,It's bad advice to teach someone how to walk on eggshells around combative or otherwise unloving behaviors. OP needs to know that the way she's treating him is unacceptable too.
241,"my mother has apologised, to her credit, over text but my aunt has not... she's the one that's pressing to see me, and part of me thinks it's because she wants to apologise in person but damn the idea of having to talk about my non-existent meth addiction again is panicked hell to me. she also might have 0 intention of saying sorry but god I don't want to see her regardless right now... but I also don't want to *not* give her a chance to say sorry either? ughhh"

I‘m more upset over how Chris handled it. Either he lied about being cool with it or he later realized that he was bothered and didn’t communicate it correctly. 

If I had known that he felt insecure, I‘d be able to make things more comfortable for him. Like, tell my friends to tone down these jokes, bring Chris to more friend meet ups so he could see for himself that Ben is no threat to him, but he didn’t even give me a chance to do something like that and that’s what made me sad. "
248,"I understand, thanks for the insight.  Yeah I guess I was just being stupid. Idk, I just never got alot of affection from females when I was younger.  I feel like that has caused me to feel like I need to prove myself or something."
249,"Closure is not something you’re going to get from this guy, at least not to your satisfaction. You want some specific reason why he stopped responding to you, that you can understand &amp; accept so you can stop wondering about it. Chances are, even if you keep contacting him, that he’s not going to provide you something so neat &amp; tidy. (If he tells you that he met someone else, for example, would you say “oh okay” &amp; move along, or would you start wondering when &amp; how he met her, whether he was looking to meet other people while you were dating, etc?) So just so your best to conclude that he’s not the right person for you because he’s the type of person that ghosts someone after texting about a follow-up date. "

251,"Sounds like she is afraid to see you grow up and live your own life.  That's hard for mothers (speaking from own experience).

Sounds like your mom did a great job (by American standards) actually. Do what everyone else is telling you regarding establishing boundaries but also point out that she moved you to a country that encourages independent children and self expression. You're not her therapist or emotional support animal - neither of those things are healthy for you or her. Encourage her to make friends of her own and find some hobbies. Good Luck!

The other answer is she's not vocal because she doesn't feel the same.  I am probably going to make this assumption in my own life when it comes to these situations.  The rest is conjecture.   I have been fabulously wrong while engaging in conjecture.

275,"As someone who has tried for YEARS to get my mom to talk to a therapist, good luck. Even after making the appointments for her she still would find excuses to not go. Not saying your mom will be the same, just giving a warning. The only way therapy actually works is if the person attending it WANTS it to work and puts in the effort required. If they won't even make an appointment they probably won't put in the work either.


Plus it shouldn't be your responsibility to make mental health appointments for her. She should be adult and mature enough to do that on her own."
276,"Trust your gut on this.

I don't honestly see anything wrong with the opposite sex being friends, even if you're 1:1.  However, I do think time and place is important.  In this scenario I don't think I'd trust this guy to not make a move.  Now, it sounds like your girlfriend wouldn't be receptive, so at least you have that going for you. 

Many people do things with good intentions and they turn out badly.  Sometimes people just want some companionship, you have a few things, and one thing leads to another.  It is important to not put yourself (or herself) in positions where mistakes can be made.  Not saying that everyone and anyone will cheat if given the opportunity/situation.  There is something to be said about avoiding potentially bad situations.

I trust my wife and she trusts me.  Neither of us with ever dream of cheating on the other.  Would l like if she went over to some guys house by herself to drink?  I'd be pretty uncomfortable about it.  I wouldn't try to stop her, she knows where the line is, but I'd would tell her I was uncomfortable.  Now, if it was one of our mutual friends, I probably wouldn't worry about it.

295,"As you know, the immigrant experience is very complex and can be different for 1st (mom), 1.5 (you...those that were brought here as children), and 2nd (those who were born here) generation. 1st have can have their feet firmly in the country/culture of origin and can find changes scary. 2nd can have their feet firmly in the new country, this is the country they know. (Though of course this may not apply to everyone, this may apply more to ppl who’s countries of origin are very different then their new country).

And then there is the poor 1.5 generation, like you and I, who didn’t have their feet firmly in either country so they have to figure out how to acculturate on their own. They often can be sad in these process and also very exploratory. This can cause friction within the family as changes and acculturation happen, the may feel they are losing their children.

Part of this process is you figuring out if you give in to your mom’s anxiety or you fight it or you put her on an information diet and allow her her process of freaking out. I suggest option 3. You can tell her you love her and can see she’s upset and you guys can talk when she’s feeling better. You CANNOT “fix” her, but you can work on how much guilt you feel due to her actions. (There is therapy dealing with acculturation issues for the family/her, however that maybe not something she is interested in). These changes are new and exciting for you, but scary for her. Don’t give in but also know that she will give up her behavior after a while.

If that was from the beginning of you relationship, it probably wasn't that great to begin with and with your mental illness in mind, I would definitely reconsider such a difficult relationship even more than I already would.

However, your attitude towards mental health issues concerns me a bit. What you're doing is obviously not working and I don't consider it good for a relationship either. What I mean with your partner is not your therapist is that you can't expect them to drop everything when you're having an episode, e.g. work, appointments, really important responsibilities or expecting them to always be perfect and understanding. That's what a therapist does.
But you need to share what is happening to you as it's a big part of you and it affects your partner as well. Plus, in my experience, bottling up leads way more often to breakdowns."
308,"I'm not implying you should give that all up, just that your current dating situation makes total sense considering the life you lead. I think marrying later in life/not having a family at all is something that happens to a lot of medical professionals, just because of the nature of their job. If you want this job and a relationship, then you might just need to resign yourself to the fact that dating will happen once the busiest part of your study is over and picking a specialty which is not super high pressure.

I feel for you and I wish this type of sacrifice was not asked from people in this field, but dating someone who is insanely busy is exhausting and not a lot of people are up for that."

I would try to talk to her again making clear that you would never cheat on her, you don't understand why she is always accusing you of cheating and that you can't go on like this. I understand that you love her, but I don't think that you're happy with this and if she's unable to change and can't even tell you why she's doing it, it's not worth all the trouble."
313,"&gt; I had some moral desire to tell him.


What does that mean?  He knows he's being sued.  What does morality have to do with anything?  Your wanting to communicate with him again for this completely made-up reason is troubling."
314,"Good point. But then he met up with her, and made it seem like it was all good; and all of a sudden ghosted her. He’s definitely hiding something. Maybe his wife found out lol"
315,"There is absolutely no reason to be jealous here. The only wrong choice she made was going outside not wearing a shirt, but it doesn't sound like there was any sexual tension involved at all."
316,Sometimes we don't know how we will respond until we have been in a situation for a little while. We would like to think we will respond one way but then we respond another. Just because your boyfriend changed his mind doesn't mean he was lying before about being cool about you being friends with your ex. Odds are he had time to be in the situation and think about it and decided it bothered him. 
317,Thank you kind stranger ❤️
318,"True, though I am not sure she cried so much as he was growing up...maybe the crying could be somewhat hormonal? Meh, I just think the acculturation process can be difficult but it’ll will even out in the end."

321,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude but.... you forgot to drop your mic."
322,This! And the women are telling her she did no wrong. If I was the guy I'd be confused as hell. Too many assumptions and clearly no communication and feedback. You women are crazy lol we still love you though!
323,"She is alright with the intimacy that we have, because sometimes I actually achieve what she wants, it just varies. Thank you for your comment."
324,No they don't pay me. And when i said to do it she was annoyed by that
325,"&gt;i'm not sure how that can help when it's something she has to fix with herself

Because talking things out with a neutral third party can help you both communicate better, and may help her to see the situation differently. The worst that happens is nothing changes, and you're where you are now. The best is, you guys improve your communication and the nitpicking gets better. What have you got to lose?"
326,"What's wrong with going out with just a coat on?  Why is it a problem to do something that is easier and more comfortable?  I totally do this when running on to get the mail, or for a quick stop at the store."
327,"&gt; but I want my children to grow up with their extended family.

One problem I have with that kind of thinking is that attempts to replicated something for our children rarely have the expected results.  There are too many factors that can lead to a completely different experience.  In fact I'm sure that some of your relatives have a very different take on what you experienced.  

You think that what you had was ideal...but it seems to have crippled your ability to imagine long term happiness outside of it.  You felt that way at 18, and you've held on to it in spite of having a good life elsewhere.

Many families are dispersed yet feel close while others live within minutes of each other and spend less time together than you do visiting your family.   The members of the first group look anticipate each opportunity to see family, appreciating those links rather than taking them for granted.

Have all the cousins of your generation stayed in that town?  Were they all able to find rewarding jobs with long-term opportunity?  Would you be able to find such work for yourself?  

If your image of the perfect life means more to you than the life you have built with your husband.  You should free him to be with someone who values real life with him over a dream rooted in the past.




"
328,"I wonder what role your parents play in this. Maybe she likes the attention of requiring “special” accommodations. For some family dynamics, this is sometimes the only way some kids get attention, sympathy, or approval from parents — acting like you “can’t handle” certain things or are helpless. 

Perhaps your parents are reinforcing this dynamic. Sometimes parents get into a rut with their kids. Like, “oh she doesn’t like to eat fish. When she was five, she threw a tantrum over fish,” but they never update or challenge that assumption as she gets older. "
329,"Yeah, I was missing a point that they were checking their social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise my imagination is too strong to reject those fantasies sometimes. And I don't really have feelings about it the moment I ejaculate, so I don't find it damaging to anyone."
330,Definite overreaction.
331,I agree with you. Guilt tripping is an abuse. 
332,"My daughter behaves almost the exact way. And no surprises....feeding her has been always a big deal/drama in our house. I think it has to do with me being impatient and forcing her to eat as a toddler. She refuses to try new things, but yes not to this extremity. Now I just try to focus on not forcing anything and trying out different foods myself. Sometimes they just watch and imitate. But more than the picky eating, what bothers me most is the affinity to sweet foods. My daughter can eat anything sweet and needs a desserts after food. Sugar cravings are never a healthy sign. But I don’t know what to do about that myself :( "
333,"Just because you have let this dynamic be for 5 years doesnt mean you can not change it!

Your wife doesnt respect, your kids dont respect you, and you do not have enough self respect to stand up for what you want. That last part is the root that leads to the other two!

If you give into them (wife and kids) all the time why will they ever listen to you? The answer is the wont.

When it is your parenting time you can do what you want, raise the kids how you see fit. Make sure your words always have real meaning, so your going to have to stand up for yourself and not give in.

This will anger your wife and she will bring up the past.... you just need to stay on

 ""hunny your right I did accidentally step on the cats tail 5 years ago, now back to how I would like to find a compromise on the kids sleeping situation""

Your going to have to be a little self deprecating and admit that you fucked up by letting her raise the kids how she wanted even though you weren't happy. Then you can talk about how this is not going to work in the long run, and things you are going change in your behaivor.

Remember you can not change her, but you can change how you treat your family (that's the first step) and how you expect to be treated. 

You can earn your kids respect, and they will love you for it."

339,Yeah I'm going to say that plays a part into why he's hesitant to say that he loves you.
340,"I would say, when you’re around her, give her lots of love and affection. Especially when she’s in a good mood and not upset. When she is upset, be as kind and affectionate as possible, but leave or end the conversation when she gets overly upset. If you show her that you’re happy and still love her, and minimize the amount of time you’re arguing (especially since she probably gets unreasonable and emotional, there’s no way to have a calm conversation about it), then she will hopefully begin to realize that you are still the same son, just happier and more grown up. And she will begin to associate the time she spends with you with being happy. 

Some things I just wouldn’t mention/discuss, especially now. For instance: Why even tell her you smoke pot? For now, talk about happy things and be really affectionate and happy to see them. You’ve thrown a lot at them, let them adjust and realize that you’re making good decisions about your life and friends. Then you’ll probably be able to bring them around about other things. In fact, I’ve seen many parents change their mind drastically about issues, because they had tactful, happy kids that were still in their life. What they really want, is just to know they’re not losing you, that you still love them and will still be there. "
341,"&gt;Who the hell goes out of the house without a shirt on?

Someone who doesn't expect to have to take off their coat before they get home.

&gt;I don't blame you in a way for feeling strange about it, because now her dentist probably thinks she's freaky and might see her that way in the future.

Who cares if the dentist think she's ""freaky""? "
342,"Heartbreak and Heartache are 2 things which are very difficult to get over. We have all been there where we always think about the one who got away. But things happen for a reason and this was not to be. While you said you made out and did not do the deed, think of all the negatives that could have happened. He probably had a small member and would come in less than a minute. He probably doesn't cut his nails regularly. He gets dandruff very often. His skin gets very dry and he probably watches a lot of TV while picking his nose and examining his boogers in great detail before rolling them into a big ball of snot and then sticking it under the table. Using this kind of vision and imagination should make you feel like throwing up everytime you think of him. Also start watching women friendly pron which shows lots of hot guys doing all the right things to their ladies. Within a month he will be a distant memory."
343,"Ugh, I'm sorry this happened to you. If only we could mandate that women wear some kind of covering when outside that would protect the men who see them from impure thoughts."
344,That's great!  Really happy to see this update.
345,"I am around your sister's age, and I have siblings so I kinda get what she is thinking. First, thank you for keeping the oath with your sister by not telling your fam, but your sister really needs to open up herself to see from your parents' view. She needs to know why they think of him like that, she needs to take a step back and see her relationship as a whole. He might be what she told you: ""been through a lot"" and etc. But 

&gt;	'he's been through a lot and just needs a break.'

This. Maybe he does need a break, but he still should not be taking advantage of his girlfriend, and being rude to her family. By rude, I mean not respectful to her fam's culture and what's worse is he is not trying to understand it at all. That shows how little of education he has had.

If your sister still won't listen, maybe you can still compromise? Like, 

&gt;	She briefly mentioned something about enjoying 'fixing' him which is a little worrying.

Then she needs to discipline him real quick. If she can't 'fix' him, she might just understand why her parents are not taking any likes in him. 


"
346,"I think so, I am slightly concerned, but I would think it's more yelling, fighting, he's a hot head etc. "
347,"How does your dad feel in all this? More importantly, it sounds like she has great unresolved issues with herself and possibly her inability to be who she wants to be and that’s why she reacts so extremely to minor things. You are not your hair and tattoos and if that makes you happy you should change it/get them. You are still you and it sounds like she doesn’t get that. Not from that type of background, but very staunch Christian parents here. Recently got my mom to accept that many what is considered “alternate lifestyle choices”are ok including Marijuana, same sex marriage, etc. just by talking to her. My dad is far less reasonable and may never come around. But I still go visit due to wanting to keep a strong relationship with mother and hopefully one day a good one with father. But most important here is don’t change any part of who you are as a good well rounded adult to please her."
348,"She wont, because of complications with the pregnancy she step down from her job to a lower, less paying position. "
349,"Of course she got irritated. You comment on her face every day and she felt uncomfortable. Because of that discomfort, she communicated with you and established a boundary.

You mentioned in your post that you consider the two of you close friends. Stepping all over ones boundries is disrespectful and not how to treat a close friend. You basically chose to make her feel uncomfortable.

If you value this friendship i'd suggest that you take the time reflect on your actions. Ask yourself why you chose to disregard your close friends request. 

One more thing. There is most likely a reason why she came to work without makeup on. In passing if you notice a girl isn't wearing makeup but usually does wear it, then don't comment on it. She will already get flack from her female piers. 

So to summarize, reflect and find out why you decided her comfort shouldnt be respected. Consider taking some time to think of a quality apology. 

Good luck and mistakes happen. Make sure to choose to grow from it."
350,"You deserve much better than this and you will be teaching your son how to respect himself by your example of not allowing someone to treat you this way. Stick with your family if they're supportive of you, and go talk to a lawyer to start thinking about your options. It doesn't sound like he has the basic respect for you that is necessary to work things out in a relationship...he literally said as much to your face. I'm very sorry you're going through this, it sounds awful. "
351,"The second relationship started after someone we don’t hang out with too often told us what a shame it was that we were broken up. We had a long chat about that and figured we could try, didn’t really work out and we ended it after a month. We didn’t even have sex the second time. 

I probably should have mentioned that in the post, but Ben had a girlfriend earlier in 2018. They broke up in June because, ironically, she still had feelings for her ex. But I think Ben and I both moved on and are happy to be friends. 
"
352,"It’s not necessarily about your wife and ex, it might be more about what they represent for you.

It is not a good idea to make real life decisions based on dreams especially when trying to interpret them literally. But sometimes it is good to try to understand what they mean to you. Professional counseling is a good step and help.

But like another user wrote, it is merely a dream after all."
353,"I would cut him loose. Not saying you can or will, but I sure as hell would leave him to play with his little pals. His priority is not his wife and child."
354,"This definitely isn't the time to become a flight attendant.  You're about to get married and try for children, so a job that requires a lot of travel should really be the opposite of what you want.  I would put off making this sort of decision until you're done with maternity leave.  You may also find being a paralegal is less boring when you're doing it part time and as a break from being the primary caregiver of your child.  "
355,You’re misreading me and honestly sound very young and inexperienced in relationships. 
356,"&gt; I actually sided with OP (and the other comments) until I read yours.

OP worded the post and title to make it sound like ""Am I an asshole for not wanting to babysit?"" was the main issue, when it's clearly not.

Either he did it deliberately to try and garner sympathy and support for his stance, or he's really that oblivious to what the underlying problem is."
357,I think you're overreacting in terms of jealously... But uh... That is really bizarre behavior from an adult woman. It's not even like she forgot! She did it on purpose. Totally bizarre. 
358,"This:

&gt; but I want to 1. Change his ways at least a bit

...is a problem.  It's not *for* you to ""change his ways""; if he didn't want his ways to be as they are, they would already be different.

If he is not someone you see a future with, then ""sticking with him for the experience"" is just as much using him as if he came here (for instance) saying ""I don't want to be with her but the sex is great, should I stick around so I can keep getting laid?"" would be using *you*.

360,"I think it's important to note that you lack the ability to perceive your interactions with Ben from the outside looking in, everything that you perceive as ""normal"" and ""platonic"" could look like much more than that to an outside observer. All the ""jokes"" from your friend group about how you and Ben are perfect soul mates who can read each other's mind, blah,  blah, blah...you perceive them as just jokes and as normal behavior, but would a complete stranger?

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is to try to remove yourself from the situation and attempt to observe it from the outside. If a complete stranger was invited to this party and observed you and Ben, can you honestly say that they would see your interactions as the completely platonic interactions of good friends? I'm not saying you're doing anything bad or wrong, I'm just saying you should do an honest assessment. You have a ""really good friend"" who is also an on-again off again boyfriend. Shoot, this is almost the exact amount of time between your last breakup and the first breakup. I'm suggesting that ""good friends"" with an extensive romantic history likely have low physical touch boundaries, low boundaries in regards to ""flirty  jokes"" and whatnots, usually interactions that Ben wouldn't have with say his platonic male ""good friends.""

&amp;#x200B;

Chris handled it poorly, I think he thought he was going to be cool with it until he was faced with the reality of it. You're going to need to decided how you proceed with that moving forward. I'd say if you really dig the dude, you should work on this - but doing so is definitely going to involve the aforementioned honest assessment of your True relationship with Ben. So, be prepared for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Just my too cents. I'm curious, though how dudes in relationships after Ben but prior to Chris have reacted to your relationship with Ben? Is Chris an outlier, or is this a pattern where the new dude gets upset and you just cut bait because you don't really care about the guy, but Chris is different because you actually like him?"
361,"Thank you! I get them mixed up lol, will go fix it"
362,Whatever you're using in your head to justify this situation you need to quit doing that and immediately divorce her.

363,"&gt; then you said the wrong thing.

No I didn't. We are talking about a specific issue here so there was no need for me to mention women or female doctors. But I guess there are many sensitive readers on reddit. So again: THIS ALSO APPLIES TO WOMEN DICTATING MEN'S BODIES AND HOW THEY FUNCTION AND IN MY OPINION (my opinion!) FEMALE DOCTORS ARE ALSO LESS QUALIFIED TO ASSES SPECIFIC MALE HEALTH ISSUES THAN MALE DOCTORS. 

And even without mentioning this, my original post was not misandric. Again me telling a woman not to allow a man to dictate what happens with her body is not misandry. It means standing up for ourselves and that we know our body best and that we do not allow lies to be spread about our bodily functions. You know you're body best too. You know your body even better than your GP. 

Let's just call this a misunderstanding ;)"
364,"You should be careful but it is NOT your fault, it is never your fault that someone abuses you

Move out when you are ready - also much much easier if you have savings. Possibly don't tell anyone about savings. Get as many qualifications as you can afford. It's the right time in your life to study, don't waste it. I did and I so regret it. Best of luck. "

It's a short-term relationship. IMO you can try to make it works as LDR but if you don't want to, it shouldn't make you feel all weird about it.   If you don't, just call it an experience of dating and let him go.

He has already lied to you about his school stuff.  That is usually something you can tell any student about, because they will all sympathize with you, even help you.

In your other comments, you mention that you even offer to tutor him in some subjects that you can help him with.

The degree and university isn't a measure of future success, but if it's your deal-breaker, then that's OK.  Take that as your reason and end things with him.


"
370,If you want your gf to be honest with you then you shouldn't be upset that she was honest with you (telling you what happened) and honest with others (the dentist). If you want your gf to be more deceitful with others then she will inevitably become more dishonest with you. Be careful what you wish for. Lying is a skill that takes practice and lots of practice tends to make it a habit.
371,"Do you have aphantasia? Once I realised I had very limited ability to picture friends and loved ones in my mind, I wondered if this might link to how quickly my feelings for family and friends dissipate (having been so strong in their company) when I've been away from them for a few days. Might be totally unrelated!"
372,"&gt;I want to have kids sometime in the near future, girlfriend never wants to give birth or have a child ever, but says maybe possibly one day she'll want a kid, but constantly when drunk/high/around other people brings up how terrible, gross, annoying it would be to have kids.

So why are you wasting your time??!? Break up. Also what kind of idiot leaves a baby with some random person who’s never watched a baby?"
373,"I don't think it is worth it, for either of you. You don't see a future with him so continuing this relationship will probably make it harder for both of you when the time inevitably comes. Both of you will only get more attached if you stay together longer. 

Another important point is that if you're feeling this, and judging from the length of your post you've been thinking about it a great deal, you should share this with your boyfriend. 

I was in a similar situation with my ex, I was in your boyfriend's position, and my then boyfriend didn't tell me he wanted to break up before uni (college), for months, even though he'd already decided. I can't convey how much pain was caused by him hiding the truth from me. 

So my advice is sit down and talk to him. Tell him how much he's helped you and how much you want to help him, but definitely do tell him that you can't see a future with him, then take it from there and decide together what you're going to do."
374,"Do you think some family counseling sessions would help?  The fact that she asked her dad was an indication that she never really accepted the idea that you wouldn't be getting back together

Children see everything in black and white without nuance.   Counseling could help her develop in that area; not just with regards to your marriage, but for other things in life."
375,"This is her life and she has a right to be angry at her dad - not so much for what he did to you, but what she feels he did to her family. If you really want things to smooth over between her and her dad then be honest with her about the state of the marriage before the cheating happened, this way she has the whole picture and understands things may have been heading for divorce anyway. That it isn't all his fault (assuming that's how you actually feel). 

You should look into getting her a therapist who specializes in family issues. And give her space. "

377,Why on earth isn't every day healthy? 
378,"Talk to her and explain to her that relationships are complicated and that even though her dad did cheat on her, it wasn't the only problem in the relationship and you aren't upset at him about it. The more you tell her that YOU'RE ok with her dad, the more she will realize that she's holding onto a grudge for herself only "
379,Somewhat sounds like she is projecting and may be cheating. 
380,check his post history lol. he needs a slap of reality
381,"&gt;Well bro, watching porn and masturbating everyday can't be healthy

Actually, it's likely good for your prostate.  Studies haven't found the direct cause/effect, but men who masterbated at least 21 times a month had a 20% lower chance of getting prostate cancer."
382,Sounds like he married her to get that sweet sweet BAH and comrats money to live off base with his bros. I wonder if she even knows about that. In the DC area around 2008ish timeframe my wife and I got around $1600 extra month for housing and another $300 for comrats.
383,He would be smart to break up with you. You are going to ruin him financially.
384,"No, I've kicked that Idea to a curb because I do have sexual interest, it just doesn't seem like it's up to part with other men.

Where it seems like most men are ready to throwdown as much as possible, for me it's more of a ""I like this, but sometimes I'm not really interested in it"""
385,"Yea men, I went trough the same thing a couple months back. The sooner you do it the sooner she’ll heal and move on. "
386,"There is nothing you can do about your mothers reactions, thats her problem and hers only. If she wants to keep contact and know whats going on in your life, she has to either accept what you do, or stop asking. And you need to put up some boundaries if you wish to keep talking to your mother about whats happening in your life. Also, you do not have to tell her/ be honest about EVERYTHING, sometimes its better to keep things to yourself especially if you know the result ends up in attempts at manipulating you.

If your mother questions how she raised you all the time tell her ""mom I'm sorry you dont feel confident in how you raised me, because if you did you would trust that you raised me well by teaching me to be my own strong willed, confident, and empathetic man you see before you today. If that brings you shame then so will everything else I do. Have a nice life""."
387,"""Mom, you may not agree with my lifestyle choices, but I consider what I'm doing safe, reasonable, and within normal limits of my own life. You need to stop shaming me and abandoning me for a week, and then acting like everything is normal. This is not normal. I have people in my life who appreciate me for me, and if you can't be one of those people, I don't know how to have a successful relationship with you."""
388,Time to cut the ties 
389,I wonder if your boyfriend is having doubts because he knows about your feelings for your friend.  I mean that would make me doubt my relationship.
390,I would not say anything unless he says something first. And maybe this is a sign that you should start making a plan to come out of the closet.
391,"You told her you are fiscally conservative.  On your wall you called out people claiming to be fiscally conservative who you believe are spending money on wasteful projects.  

I guess I don't see how your post is in any way contrary to what you told her.  As you can do is ask her why she thinks that this is different from what you told her and see what she says."
392,Returning the money will cause distress and anger to her in the short term - keeping their money and planning will cause distress and anger in the long term to you and your SO. Give the money back. That’s what my SO and I did - used our own money and ignored parents and we had a blast. 
393,"&gt; Idk why everyone is being so harsh on your girlfriend and not seeing the implication.

Because OP, whether intentionally or not, has slanted the story from a certain angle. There are people who are picking up on the details and questioning stuff (like the implications of OP having zero experience in childcare at the age of 32, even though his gf babysits regularly), and there are people who've just completely identified with his pov and the way he's presented things."
394,"Personally?  Let it go and then if your brother does come home from his trip and asks you about it, then that means he's genuinely interested and wants to know more about his brother.  If he doesn't say anything?  Meh, he probably thinks you're traumatized enough and you'll discuss this  later on down the road at some point.  But I cringed when I read this so I can't imagine your horror.  \*hugs\*"
395,"It may be worth putting her on an information diet. Certain things she might just not need to know. For example, if you're going out of state, you can say you're going to visit a friend from college or want to see a particular museum. If you get a new tattoo and it's maybe not so likely she'll ever see it, just don't say anything.

You're 25. You don't need to tell her everything about your life if this is how she's going to react."
396,"Dude you have to divorce her. Just the age gap is concerning. An 18 year old moving in with 27 yr old. I'm not saying that just because of the age gap. 18 year olds have a certain naivete to them. But shit man, this is in no way a healthy relationship for you. She is shitting on you with her friends all the time. Just be thankful that you don't have any kids. Because I'm pretty sure that this woman would have fucked them up as well

My main concern is that she is going to try to sleep with some random guy that she has known for a few months instead of being with someone who's she known for a decade"

398," 

Toxic relationships are dangerous to your health; they will literally kill you. Stress shortens your lifespan. Even a broken heart can kill you. There is an undeniable mind-body connection. Your arguments and hateful talk can land you in the emergency room or in the morgue. You were not meant to live in a fever of anxiety; screaming yourself hoarse in a frenzy of dreadful, panicked fight-or-flight that leaves you exhausted and numb with grief. You were not meant to live like animals tearing one another to shreds. Don't turn your hair gray. Don't carve a roadmap of pain into the sweet wrinkles on your face. Don't lay in the quiet with your heart pounding like a trapped, frightened creature. For your own precious and beautiful life, and for those around you — seek help or get out before it is too late. This is your wake-up call! webbsolutionist at gmail dot com"
399,So an ex staying with her for a month and her telling you to stay away because he would feel uncomfortable is ok but you having drinks with a group that includes a female is not ? 
400,"Yup, take it from someone’s that’s done the family hoop dance, you can’t please them all and end of the day gotta do what makes you happy "
401,Let her be upset and angry for a while then if you feel she's wallowing a bit tell her that her Dad only told her the truth because he was sure she'd be mature enough to handle it and understand that the betrayal was of you and not of the family and you're past it. If she's like any average 14yo she'll be desperate to let everyone see just how grow  up and mature she really is.
402,"You want children, she doesn't, the relationship is doomed.     

Staying with her at 32 is not only a waste of time but it's a poor strategic move especially if you want children.   

I think she's using her babysitting gig as a way to ""pay you back"" for the pressure she might be feeling from you about having children.   

You should **NEVER** do anything that you don't want to do, especially be responsible for someone else's life.    "
403,"IMPORTANT: IF he is cheating, make sure you can prove it. Adultery is a punishable offense under UCMJ, and his military career will have a quick flip, especially once it comes to light that he is housing single soldiers, who should most likely be in their barracks.  Contact the local JAG office on post. 

I hate to say this but it seems like he married you so that he could get BAH and leave the barracks. Is he giving  you half his BAH? I believe these days the Army requires that if you live separately you’re entitled to half of the BAH, but I’ve been out for a few years and never married, so I’m no expert. Once again consult the JAG office on post. "
404,"No one is perfect and most people are not doing as well as it seems they are... I'm also getting married in several months and we both want to lose weight, but I'm usually too exhausted from work to make smart choices. Our apartment is almost never fully in order unless we dedicate our entire weekend to cleaning. If you really feel no motivation to do anything, you could try seeing a therapist for depression. More likely it seems like you're just burnt out from trying to do everything. Does your fiance help with chores, cooking, etc? "
405,Yeah I appreciate in hindsight how screwed up it was. I could sit here and wax lyrical about how I was under a lot of stress but it doesn't change the fact that I did it. Thanks for the perspective. 
406,"There are so many comments on here but one way you might want to talk to her about moving to another state in these terms.

""Mom, you and Dad left YOUR family. You left your cousins, siblings, perhaps aunts and uncles to pursue a dream. Now, why would you deny me the very thing you to modeled to me? You taught me that it is ok to follow opportunity or else you would still be back in our home country."""
407,"Dude he invited her out to have drinks, probably knowing that she was underage. Then just so happens to be like hey well I have alcohol at my place lets just go there. Dude it totally trying to fuck your girlfriend. 

Honestly the fact that she even though it was ok to go have drinks with some random guy alone at his place is kind of odd in itself. 

Have her put herself in your shoes, you spent all day with a girl having a good time learning something new. Then later that night she asks you to come over to her place alone to have some drinks with her. 

I don't think your girlfriend would be happy with that at all."
408,But...how would they be exposed? People don’t randomly try to take off my coat/jacket when I’m out and about.
409,"You responded to the wrong comment, I think.

Though, she didn't go to the dentist with the intention of getting looked at, aka a situation where she would have the reasonable expectation of taking off her coat, she stopped in to make an appointment during a trip anticipated to take less than 20 minutes. A coat is just a top if you don't take it off. "
410,"&gt; Am I a bad person for finding other girls attractive when I have a girlfriend? 

No it's normal.  You'd be a bad person if you acted upon your attraction to another woman while you were in an exclusive relationship with someone else."
411,"Totally agree. There is a difference between living your life the way you want, and rubbing in your parents' faces everything you do that you know will upset them. As e_finch said, the haircut, maybe some piercings and tattoos are unavoidable to hide (and you shouldn't try to), but the drugs, concerts, moving plans, etc, are not their business and telling them seems more like an act of defiance to see their reactions. Keep them to yourself. They will eventually come around, or maybe they won't, but if you want to keep them close, as you say, and not cut them from your life, be smart about what you share with them. "
412,I just wanna say my brother who’s 19 has eaten almost exclusively pbj sandwiches since he was young
413,This is not a marriage. 
414,"You're a 24 year old adult OP and you need to start figuring this shit out. If you can't find a good job that fits your career path, it may be time to find a temporary part-time job that isn't ideal for your career path to get yourself out of the house and get yourself some money in your pocket. Your lifestyle doesn't sound super healthy and I don't see it getting better until you do something about it. "
415,"Your girlfriend is either incredibly naive or wants to get a reaction out of you. 

If I was in her shoes and my bf said he felt uncomfortable with me hanging out with this guy, that would be it. I would not go. Why does your gf care if it's a nice gesture or not? You feel uncomfortable. That is enough to not go. "
416,However I surely understand if someone who has not had such a toxic person in their life finds it hard to understand. 
417,"It's not the end of the world, really. No child is going to die because they missed a meal. They may, however, remember that empty stomach next time they choose to refuse to eat dinner."
418,"Stop involving your mom in everything. She doesn't need to know about every tattoo (unless visible), same with piercings, garage punk concert, relationship your in. You have changed, she hasn't. If you are really bothered by her reaction stop showing off /sharing. You sound selfish to me. "
419,"I wouldn't want my SO to be a flight attendant either, honestly. You're really brushing the issues with this pretty rash decision under the rug. Did you take out loans for these legal degrees? How do you plan to pay them back, or do you expect him to do it? You said you basically expect him to support you financially, is that what you two have been doing up until now? I know I would be *really* concerned if my SO was suddenly like ""I'm going to take a job where you have to support us entirely now, good luck!"" and didn't seem to think that would be a problem. Honestly, I would wonder if they were ramping up to take financial advantage of me long-term, because that would indicate a complete disregard for me as a person and a huge red flag.

I don't think you should continue in a job that burns you out. But I think you're thinking of this job *because* you're burnt out, not because it's a good decision. Your fiance is keeping you grounded here. You should save up some vacation time, take a long vacation, and don't go anywhere. Just recuperate from burnout and consider what you *actually* plan to do for the rest of your life. Not a jaunt in minimum wage to clear your head; an actual life plan. You're saying here ""I'm burnt out in this job that uses my degree"", but not what you plan to do after. You can't just ""go from there"" anymore."
420,"&gt;  but when he told me to stay it broke my heart. 


That's understandable. But this sentence right here, if nothing else in your story, is the nail in the coffin.

He told you to stay. He doesn't want to be with you. You hooked up young, you got pregnant, getting married seemed like what you ought to do, but he doesn't really want to be married, and he doesn't want to be with you. You were the hookup whom he's now saddled with because you're a baby-mama.

I was in the military, I've seen how this goes down. Your story is sadly typical, and it always ends pretty much the same way.

I'm sorry, but there is almost zero chance that a heart-to-heart talk will result in him coming to an epiphany and realizing that he really loves you and wants to be a husband and father and he needs to get his shit together. Oh, a tearful conversation might make him feel bad, and think about ""manning up,"" and remember some of the good times you've had, long enough for him to think maybe he can ""make it work."" But it won't last, because his heart isn't there. All you can do is maybe drag it out a while longer, with him becoming increasingly resentful."
421,"I’m going to get a lot of people disagreeing and will get creamed....

Lots of people jump at conclusion and play victim empathized. You are an adult and went to a party with a lot of alcohol. And you are deflecting the blaming for your friend for telling you to go with it. 

Has it occurred to you that you are partially for the blame putting yourself in that situation? I understand it is not your fault for what happened but you should really know your limit and the surrounding you’re in before getting wasted.

Your boyfriend probably think that you could’ve stopped by being more forceful, scream, or yell out sexual assault so loud that the neighbor could hear. 

Again, sorry for what you went through but your friend shouldn’t be getting your blame deflection if you both are an adult. Your boyfriend is a different story altogether."
422,You don't give her dessert. End of. 
423,"What evidence do you have to support the second half of this statement other than sexism?

I have to be honest, not wanting your first solo childcare experience to be babysitting your girlfriend's friend's one year old is not tantamount to not wanting to equally share parental responsibilities with your partner for your own children. That's \*quite\* the leap."
424,"Thank you for your opinion. Personally, I don't think I'm any of those things. Still, I'll reflect on this and make sure that I'm offering him a safe space to be himself around me."
425,"It's completely wrong for you to be JEALOUS... how in hell is this girl worth JEALOUSY???    


What are you missing out on here?  This IS NOT a Keeper.  RUN!  FAST!"
426,"She seems unstable, and maybe even projecting because she is cheating on you with her ex of 15 years. Time to cut ties and be happy you escaped your first wife, you don't want to have to escape a 2nd."
427,Can you point her to online resources so you don’t have to give a private sex ed lesson?
428,"I am working through my stuff I see a psychiatrist and a therapist and usually am doing really well. That doesn't mean I have my off days like everyone else. I'm raising our son on my own. All of my energy goes towards him or my schoolwork. At the end of the day there isn't much left for me. I even apologized the next day to his friend about what was said, but I do still think he needs to understand that he is not more entitled to my husband's time than me. Did I say that? Of course not. I apologized explained what was going on and he in turn said he ""has no respect for me"". I know it is a lot. And I really try not to be dramatic, I rarely tell him or anyone in my life what's going on, but sometimes I need my husband. In regards to the military he joined seriously right before we found out I was pregnant so I can't blame him for that. Does it suck? Oh totally, but it was no ones fault at the end of the day. What I heard was disgusting. And it's true if he really thinks that about me then we shouldn't be married. I've been fine on my own this whole time, but I deserve someone who respects me and if he can't and doesn't do that why stay? "

....and your BF is continuing the assault.    If he's not part of the solution he's part of the problem.    

I know you don't want to think about ending the relationship, but he's just not re-directing anger over what happened.  He's actively blaming you, in effect he's saying, ""I think you wanted to have sex with those two guys and after it happened you were afraid I'd find out so created the story that they assaulted you.""  He's making your assault about him. "
437,"It was so cringeyy, my face was like white as a ghost. I just hope he doesn’t tell anyone else like his gf because she’s pretty gossipy "
438,"She's not asking for anything bad, just knowledge that she thinks you might have. You could stop her from making a horrible mistake like getting an unwanted pregnancy, so unless it makes you incredibly unconfortable you should show her some guidance, or at least some website or something, nothing wrong with that."
439,"I think it'd be a good idea to tell your bf just so he knows that you guys have been talking and there's nothing weird going on. I don't think you should buy condoms for her, that's a situation that could get weird down the road. "
440,"Yeah, not to mention you worry about coming across as presumptuous or conceited if you assume the guy has romantic intentions. Like the meme where the girl tells the guy “Sorry, I have a boyfriend” and the guy was just asking her about a group project. She comes off as a b****."
441,"My wife an I don't cook together, it doesn't work.  We both have our styles and it creates issues.  We figure that out very quickly. So when someone is cooking we'll check in once or twice, maybe steal a little something, then leave.  Otherwise is results in nitpicking and bad attitudes.

442,"&gt;He said of course they took that as a opening because I didn’t refuse to go in to the room with them.

Your boyfriend is an idiot who doesn't understand consent. The absence of a ""no"" is not the same as a ""yes"". Everyone knows drunk people can't consent.

446,"Of course it’s not rude to ask for help. It’s never rude to ask for help, especially when asking your partner.

How he reacts to it depends on his situation such as how tired he is, his mood etc. But if you convey your situation well enough, I’m sure he will put in the effort to help you sleep.

Maybe you can help him help you by asking for specific stuff. Maybe ask for a head massage? Lullabys? Whatever works. Ideally, ask him before he goes to bed. Good luck :)"
447,Meal prep would be a good idea. I used to do that back when I had more motivation. I just walk home and see the sheer number of things to do and just end up doing none of it out of mental exhaustion. My fiance and I talk about overhauling our lives all the time but we just have no fucking clue and end up doing nothing. I wish I had some sort of step by step guide to having an organized balanced life. 
448,"It’s not rude to ask them to help you, but it’s definitely rude to wake them up to do it. Their sleep is just as important as yours."
449,"I think you're mis-interpreting the statement.

She's not telling him ""I'll want to have kids one day to keep you happy (in the future).""

She's telling him ""I'll want to have kids one day"" to keep him happy (now).

&amp;#x200B;

She knows he wants kids. She doesn't want to have kids. She's lying to him and telling him that she will want kids one day in order to keep him happy right now because she knows it's something he wants in the future. She's stringing him along, but tells the truth when she's drunk. OP is still with her for reasons I haven't figured out yet, denial, maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

OP is not a bad person for wanting to have kids. He's also not a bad person for not wanting his first solo childcare experience to be babysitting a random infant.

OP's GF is not a bad person for not wanting children. I'd argue that she is a bad person for stringing OP along, and using his desire for children as a weapon when he doesn't feel comfortable bailing her out of her situation. "
450,"Your sister needs to be seeing a child psychologist, or even just a family physician if that's more feasible, about her odd eating habits. As others have pointed out, it could be caused by a number of things: ADHD, sensory processing disorders, autism, OCD. Some people with these conditions can force themselves to choke down hated foods when they're with friends or strangers, so they don't seem rude or weird.

Your parents need to do something about this, so she doesn't end up unhealthy and resentful as an adult. If she keeps eating like this, it will be very difficult for her to adjust her eating habits as an adult -- trust me, I've spent the past 5 years training my boyfriend out of being a super-picky-eater (although not as picky as your sister). Being an adult picky eater sucks. You can't go out on dinner dates or to dinner with friends because you can't eat any of the food. It's a huge strain on longterm relationships, because your uber-restricted diet is a burden on your significant other. It will almost certainly make you obese and unhealthy, because picky eaters (your sister included) tend to only like carb, salt, and sugar heavy foods. 

My boyfriend resents his mother for not forcing him out of his picky eating at a younger age. He credits it as her #1 parenting failure."

459,"You're right. My interactions with Ben feel natural to me but I've never taken an outside perspective into account. I only briefly talked to Ben at the party as Chris was my priority and I wanted to make sure he felt welcome. I talked more with my girl friends that night. I'd hope that my friends won't joke about my ex being my soul mate in front of Chris but I probably should have had a word with them before the party, just to be safe. 

Apart from an occasional hug, Ben and I rarely have physical contact. I also wouldn't describe four month total as an extensive romantic history, but I see what you are getting at.   Over all we are a pretty open and close knit group and I don't think I treat Ben different from the others.   

Chris overreacted and handled  his jealousy not very well. I'm gonna meet him tonight and see if we can talk things over. I'll try my best to be insightful and understand his concerns but I do hope that he'll apologize and get that Ben is my friend and I won't let him dictate my friendships.  

I've only dated two other guys aside from them. One in July 2016 but we hadn't much in common so we ended it early and he never got to meet my friends. 

The second guy was from September 2017 to March 2018. He and Ben met a couple of times and always were civil. The guy wasn't really the jealous type and said “He can live with it” and we never really had to argue over our relationships with other people. We split in March because we kind of faded out and weren't into each other enough to work on the relationship. 

So yeah, thing with Chris is that I really wanted this to work but I've never had to deal with jealousy before and am a bit overwhelmed. Chris and I have a lot in common and worked well so far. I was really close to ask him to be official before his outburst and now I'm left to see how things turn out tonight... I hope we can recover from this, I still really like him.

&gt; He half-heartedly cuddled me, but I felt no warm intention or effort on his end. 

He was asleep. And worse you are ascribing intention to his actions. He has no control over your feelings about his intentions.

&gt; It just makes me feel so alone and wishing I was in my own bed alone. 

This is confusing. You would rather be by yourself than with someone not cuddling you?

&amp;#x200B;

I think you are going about this all wrong. You two can talk NOT AT NIGHT about what he is willing to give to you when you can't sleep. For example if I were him I would say ""I'm willing to cuddle you if you ask before bed but once I am asleep it is unacceptable to wake me for the purpose of helping you sleep.""

it was her irresponsibility that got her into this mess - don’t let her drag you there as well.  it will not end up good for you.  you will get fucked in any outcome.  if you really think she will try and kill herself then make some calls to get her help and get her monitored in these times.  obviously she still needs help if that’s her first thought.

Like... preventing your GF from getting drinks at a public place with friends or co-workers because you think she might get drunk and cheat is wrong.  


And then there's common sense like the sky instructors intentions. He wanted to liquor her up at his house and get frisky with her. Not saying he is a terrible person or anything for wanting to have consensual sex, but I mean this is like basics.

I think starting off an interaction with a stranger by telling them you know potentially embarrassing personal details of their life like this would throw a lot of people off.  They don't know if you're genuinely interested in helping or if you're just snooping for juicy gossip about your neighbors.

480,"Honestly, I think you should break up with Chris. I also dated a dude who had some jealousy over me still hanging out with an ex (an ex I wasn't as close to as you are to Ben, even!), but he didn't try to manipulate me or get all passive aggressive about it. He was honest about feeling jealous, we had a conversation to see if we could figure out any solution (other than me dropping the friend, which even the dude didn't want; he didn't want to be *that guy*). We didn't really come up with anything other than 'just give it time and keep communication open', and ultimately the jealousy ended up fading as the relationship progressed and got more secure.

Chris sounds like he's really not mature enough to handle his jealousy like an adult, and it's just going to be *waaay* too much effort dating him without cutting out your friend.

Sure, there are dudes who will be put off by you having a very close friend, but everyone gets to define what they're looking for in a SO and it sounds like one of your dealbreakers is 'can't handle I once dated, very briefly, my BFF'."

I recently had a conversation with my bf in which he pointed out that he wishes I would wear heels more and I asked him when he plans on wearing formal shoes as well. He said they hurt his feet and I said same for me. 

I asked him for an equal amount of effort as he is willing to see in me. It toned him down a bit. 

I also explained the costs involved in terms of financial and time spent and the actual value of it. 

Ask him to take you out more if he expects more.effort from you but at the same side point out how superficial that can be.

""Until you can behave reasonably I won't be talking to you for a month. I will contact you. If you force contact sooner the time will be extended."" Stop having conversations about you and your life. Simply state you are an adult. You've made your decision. ""This isn't open for discussion."" If she persists leave or end the call. And be ready for backlash because she doesn't sound stable. In time you may find the only option is to cut her out of your life. I hope she comes around but it doesnt sound like it.

The idea of being ""sex positive"" is nice and all, but the fact of the matter is parents can still raise a whole world of ruckus for someone over ""corrupting their child"" if they get their nose out of joint over the whole thing.

You also were pressuring him into a relationship he wasn't ready for; that's pretty bad too. If he doesn't feel ready, then he's not ready and you shouldn't be trying to throw him in the deep end like that.

You've also already broken it off twice in a short amount of time; that's emotionally draining on both people and not a good start to a relationship either.

All the advice in here that's coddling you instead of pointing out the numerous mistakes that you've made is absolute bull, so I might be sounding this harsh because of it, but you've made your bed, now lay in it.

You need to let your daughter deal with this on her own. Be there for her if she needs support or someone to listen to, but ultimately it's up to her if she wants her father in her life after this. If she doesn't, that's her choice and you need to respect it. "

Please do not listen to people telling you to stop giving her private lessons.  She is coming to you because she trusts you. I think everything you have said so far is great in terms of protection."

I think it's not fair that you're the only one making plans for the both of you. A relationship should be fun and it should be about enjoying eachother's company too. If she doesn't put in effort into doing that for you guys, especially if it used to happen in the past and not now, I bet it feels frustrating. I would be upset if I were the only one trying to keep it fun and my SO responded with ""yeah, sure, whatever you want"" and doing things only to please me. I wouldn't want it to be obligatory and I'd want it to be something that they're looking forward to too. 

Maybe talk to her about things and ask her what she genuinely likes to do with you?

498,"Check out r/ARFID.

I have this eating disorder and thankfully have worked my way out of its clutches due to people around me being kind but NEVER enabling. Your parents are 100% doing her a disservice by not trying to help her grow. 

I didnt start improving until I was in my 20s and pay the price for it every day (chronic health issues) and most people never get better when they are enabled. "
499,"I work for a large media company, but this advice is good for any job.

1. Get your priorities straight. If you primarily work for X, make sure you get the stuff X asks of you done first and then work on Y. That is unless you are told otherwise. We have a lot of interns and people that don't last long and a common theme is them not doing the work in the correct hierarchy. I've given people priority #1 tasks to do and yet they wait to do them until a priority #5 task is completed simply because they started on that one first. Be flexible and get to know what is important and needs to be done ASAP and what can wait til later.

2. Work first, fun second. If you need to sit down and shut up for a couple hours to get something done, do it. Don't feel bad if you have to step out of a conversation or tell someone ""Hey, can we talk about this later, I have to finish this"". Some people feel pressured to be social, but in the end work should come first. I've heard a lot of people at my work miss deadlines because they were didn't have time, but I see them talking in the break area with so and so. Not okay. This isn't to say you shouldn't be social though. Being a healthy and fun part of a workplace is vital. Not just for others, but for you too. It's good to have friends at work that can back you up, support you or cover for you. Hard to have that if you are the office loaner.

3. Enjoy it. Nothing says bad employee like the person who constantly looks like they don't want to be there.

4. Stand up for yourself. Just because you are an intern, doesn't mean you are always wrong. If you think something is being done wrong or could be done better, be diplomatic about it and let someone know. Even if you are wrong, it still shows initiative that you want to help the company improve and as long as you aren't coming across as I-know-better, you should be fine."
500,"Well, fake it till you make it. Try being proactive and don't say no to challenges and opportunities. This seems to be your chance to learn new things and make connections, so make sure you use it. Force yourself to talk to people, accept tasks you are clueless about (have the ""I've never done it, but I can learn it"" attitude), and practice small talk. People usually like being asked how their day is going, and also reply if someone asks you the same.

A word of caution: I'm not sure how they treat their interns, it can sometimes be the case that the companies abuse the people who work for free. Accept tasks that are related to your field, but also don't be a pushover. You are starting at the bottom of the ladder, but that doesn't mean the company should abuse you (and it's capitalism, they see you as a money-making resource probably, nothing more than that)."
501,"I was a picky eater as a child and it follows me through adulthood. It's more an aversion to textures though but similar to your sister I could mostly eat whatever at other people's homes (minus tomotaes and onions gross) I didn't enjoy it but was polite but at home my palate was more limited.

At 11 it's normal, she's gaining her independence now so hopefully that will come with being a little more grown up and you can just keep offering her new foods but she'll grow out of it. Worst case start sending her to school with a packed lunch of baby food and that should break that habit quickly. "
502,"Whether he loves you or not isn't the issue. What you want is for your partner to firmly, unequivocally express his love for you and he seems incapable of doing it. Are you okay with being in a relationship for this long, maybe even marrying this person who can't express his love for you? A person who just ignores your texts when you bring up an issue that's really important to you?

If you're okay with it never happening, then by all means stay. But you can absolutely do better than a guy like that. You should be with someone who not only *can* say he loves you, but *wants* you to know that he loves you."
503,"That was the bit that really stood out to me. Picky eating is one thing, but it's even worse that the only food group of which she enjoys a wide variety is sweets. That's pretty telling. 

Six pieces of chocolate after lunch and dinner - I mean, everyone has different notions about health and diet, but that sounds like way too much to me. Even if the child were eating a normal, nutritionally-balanced meal, I would think that was a bit too much. Maybe 2 or 3 pieces after dinner, 1 after lunch. MAYBE. You really don't want to let kids overindulge in sweets even if they're not particularly unhealthy. In the case of a severe picky eater like this (who probably isn't even getting all her required nutrition as it is) should definitely not be given dessert all the time. Yikes. "
504,"So I'm coming at this from a different perspective: I think she's allowed, at 14 years old, to decide where her morals lie. Here's why.


My boyfriend's grandfather cheated on his wife and broke up their family. They had six kids. The oldest, who I believe was in his late teens, decided to never speak to his father again. Despite the fact that the event was directly involving him, it was enough of a moral issue for him to justify never involving his father in his life again. The rest of the kids and the wife actually moved on, and the seven of them (five kids and both parents) have Christmas and whatnot together. The oldest son is not involved. He's nearing 60. It's been 40 years. I'm not going to argue whether I agree with the oldest son's actions, but personally I think a man being so offended by cheating can't be too terrible.


Your daughter is allowed to make that choice. I agree with others here that the best thing can be to express your wishes for their relationship, but don't push it. If cheating is a big enough deal for her now, she'll turn out to be a very loyal adult. That's not a bad thing."
505,"Would her parents be unhappy with her having sex at her age? Or what do you think would make them get dramatic about it?

I mean, you are not the reason she has sex. She would probably do it, even if you didn't give her any answers about it, so noone can blame you for anything as long as you don't tell her complete nonsence and I don't think you would."
506,"Well I guess because the husband appears so dang clueless and stubborn in his post! I agree they BOTH need to dial it back several notches, and someone flipping out over not being able to find me when I was in the back yard all the while would get an eyeroll from me too. "
507,"&gt;Because i walued the 10 years we passed together

Sunk cost fallacy. Google that.

You need to get out of this very one-sided relationship. She has shown you who she is, believe her, this is who she is, she will never change. You deserve the chance to be happy and find love, and you won't get that while married to her."
508,"Thank you for your kind words.

As part of the ongoing training that those of us in the ministry team undertake, we studied end-of-life transition counseling some few years ago, in order to help those whose lives were coming to a close, and those they would be leaving behind, cope with the feelings that they would inevitably face.

But grief happens with all *sorts* of major (and sometimes even minor) life changes, including job transitions, relationship breakups, and (as in OP's daughter's case) learning something devastating about a loved one's actions.

Though the cause of the grief can be one of any number of things, the process of grieving is actually pretty much the same across the board, though perhaps greater or lesser in magnitude depending on the nature of the loss.

I've found that applying the principles of end-of-life transition to other forms of grief works well, because every change is a death of a kind, even if only of what was before."
509,"This is what I suspect as well, thanks for a firsthand account. "
510,Well it’s a great sign that she is willing to try other foods at friends homes and at school. Maybe talk to her in private and tell her you are concerned. Don’t scare her or anything. And tell her that if she tries something new she likes to tell you. Also maybe work on her liking one new thing a month. Take it slow. You mentioned she likes sweets. Could she eat a homemade fruit smoothie and you can tell her it’s a milkshake or something?

522,"Your mom is going to do this for a while, maybe forever. I saw another comment you made asking someone if you should get your mother a therapist. No. Your mother should seek out her own therapist if that is something she wants to do for herself, but do not get involved with selection of getting your mom a therapist over this issue you are having with her. What is happening for you is simply independence, and your mother is in her habits of control right now. Her reason is because it still works on you.

What you described as her punishment is she cries, ignores, things go back to normal. If you want to change her methods you'll have to be clever enough to control and change your reactions. For instance, the next time you announce something to her and she starts crying about it... laugh at her. Don't stop laughing at her until she gets angry with you. You are 25 years old. It is ridiculous that anyone treats you this way, including your mother. I'm not suggesting you laugh at her like a bully, more like laugh at her like she's a toddler. Look at her like she is a toddler, and continue to laugh and treat her as you would a little toddler throwing a temper tantrum until she stops. 

Why is this ok? Because your mom is not crying and upset over a legitimate reason, she's doing it to control you. You don't have to put up with it. You are putting up with it, bc it's hard to see our moms cry. But, at some point you're going to have to take control of all of it, and show her yourself (not via a therapist) how foolish she is for treating you like this. That's the only way you'll get her to actually stop the loop.

The first time you do this, she might end up ignoring you for a longer spell... that's how you know it's working. Best of luck.

524,"How does she expect you to reassure her that your not cheating other then to deny it?

I'm just baffled by people like her. Does she want you to jump through hoops or something every time she suspects your cheating to prove you aren't. Does she want you to prove you are where you say you are. Prove that your female friends and co-workers are platonic and professional. Never leave her sight since that means your looking for other woman. GPS track your location so she can make sure your in the right place. Never talk or text another female since that means your cheating.

She needs some sort of counseling to work through her insecurities. "
525,"Except the part in which stalks her disliked persons, I could have sworn that you are describing me. Ashamed to admit it but maybe it gives your perspective. 

Instead of pointing out the obvious addiction. Ask her in a heart ro heart conversation over dinner or so, how she sees your relationship now and in the next 3 years. What are her expectations and work it from there...

Also,I would not sway off the depression aspect. I discovered that I felt my brain was just flatting out and decided together with my bf to join university again. It gave me joy and excitment. True excitment for learning and doing something new. I wanted this but didn't know how to figure it out that I wanted it. I was afraid.

529,"Haha fuck all that. When my sis popped out some pups I told her straight up that I wouldn't babysit. Just tell her no, you're not doing it. Sack up. "
530,Jesus are you sure she's not 12 years old
531,"I think he wanted to tell you how he felt just to communicate with you how he feels. You tried to explain your perspective, which he saw as you being defensive. He wanted to tell you how he felt and your response is all about you and your perspective and how *you* feel. What about him? I see him being very kind and supportive. He is just asking for that in return.

I think all you had to say was ""I'm sorry yesterday didn't work out like we wanted."" I think *you* think this is all your fault and your projecting that onto him."
532,"There's something else going on here too, home from work exhausted but then can't sleep. A doctor is definitely the best route here. "
533,"Unless you live in an extremely economically disadvantaged area, that means you're doing something wrong. Either your resume is crap or you interview badly.

539,"Where has OP ""insisted she sacrifice so much"" for a potential child?

Where is the correlation between ""I don't want to babysit a stranger's child because I'm ill-equipped and never volunteered to"" and ""if we have a baby, all the responsibility will fall on my GF""??

There is too much missing info for folks to be making such declarative statements about OP's capabilities as a father. And it is quite common to make it to 32 without ever changing a diaper. "
540,The part where it has been at least two YEARS in this relationship where the girlfriend can only be honest about her feelings on this issue when she's drunk/high/around other people.

542,"Also friends and family.

You do need to get a consultation from a lawyer to make sure you aren't on the hook for abandoning your family, but you need out of the house.

Do you have someone you can live with for a couple months?  Do you currently have a job or the ability to get one?"
543,"I agree with this?

That doesn't really affect anything I said, though?"
544,"I take showers and wear clean clothes, I think it’s more of the first one that he wants me to look like I’m going out when we’re casually hanging out. Shorts, a nice blouse... jeans a sweater and heels as his suggestions. 

Also I thought I’d mention there has been times I try to “dress up” and he makes fun of me saying I look like a lady making tortillas at a restaurant or whatever because I’m Hispanic and sometimes like to dress in a flowy tops with embroidery and look a little indigenous or business casual. I think the style he wants me to wear is revolving around rompers, shorts, cleavage kind of deal with trendy clothes. "
545,If y'all haven't been dating for too long you might have to break it off or you could play the waiting game and give her some time to come to her senses and talk about why she pulled a stunt like that and  anger management dude. 
546,Dude. She made you call your mom to pick you up. Yes. Break up with her.
547,"Don't wait for him to fall in love with you. That's a trope that seems to work better in romcoms. You deserve someone who loves you for you, and that person exists. He just isn't the guy you're dating.  


And it does sound like you're not cut out for casual relationships. No shame there; they're not for everyone. Do what's right for you. You'll be amazed at what that will do for your sense of self-esteem. You deserve better."
548,She should have never asked you she should know better to just refuse the offer. She wanted to go and let you know she was going. Ppl have drinks with a group not 2 of the opposite sex alone. And then he wants to take her to his place come on. Is she blind. She liked him and she wanted to go she asked you so she wouldn’t feel guilty. She kept bringing it up to you meaning she wanted to go badly. as soon as he said my place that should’ve gave a girl who’s in a relationship a red flag. Alone with another man who’s not your bf never a good idea. I’d be careful of this one. You both need a long talk about where your relationship is heading. 
549,"They need to now. Alcoholics are masters at hiding it. Some of the child’s problems may arise from alcohol. The doctors need to know she is an alcoholic, as it may affect the treatments they give the baby. "
550,"If you feel this guilty about forging a signature, it’s safe to say you probably won’t drain his accounts. "
551,"You're 19. The relationship isn't the healthiest, either. You have a chance to move here to Canada (I'm Canadian) and develop a better life. Canada might be able to offer you a better job and more stability over time so its a good move to make for yourself. We also have an array of social services to assist you if you wanted counselling for some of the issues you mentioned above."
552,"Talk to your boyfriend about it. If there's something bothering you, it concerns the both of you, especially if trust is involved. Open and honest communication is crucial in a relationship."
553,"Wow, gosh. I wish I had more to contribute other than ""I feel ya"". My dating history is a bit similar: 

Ages 13-26: Whipsaw between ""Bad Boys""/""Mr. Wrong"" and sweet shy nerdy dudes who I chewed up and spat out (not intentionally!) ALL the wrong choices. Much older dudes, dudes with serious issues, going back to exes, you name it. 

Age 26-35: single on purpose, casual dating only.

Age 35: got together with a friend, intense but it flamed out and crashed and burned 

Age 38: got together with a different friend and it's a ""slow burn"". The intensity isn't there, and honestly I do miss it at times. I've questioned if it's the right relationship for me and for him. Most of the time it's peaceful, mature, sweet, loving, caring, and supportive. (like 5% bickering or upset). It's the hands-down best relationship I've ever been in. And when I need to ""scare myself straight"" I just read the tales of guys who slam cupboard doors, are addicted to pr0n, trash talk their GF's while they're pregnant, have no libido, don't wash their own butt, and on and on. I do realize I'm very, very lucky! 

But there is something ""missing"" and 6 out of 7 days I'm okay with it. You can't have it all. I chose stability, kindness, peace, and harmony over intense OMG passion. I do miss feeling like the world outside could burn as long as I had ""Pookie"" (or whoever) but I'm almost 40. Those years are behind me now, and that's okay. I have memories of wild times and super passion and I have a wonderful man who I love very dearly. I don't need to get greedy. "
554,"I would recommend you shut him down HARD.

“Boyfriend, you need to push aside whatever jealousy is in your head because I need you to HERE FOR ME. I was attacked and assaulted. There was no consent involved. I need you to realize that and help me work through this. Can you do that?”"
555,"I have a brother and mother like this. The best thing you can do it be honest. She'll pick him, every time. She'll cry that you don't want to participate if he's involved. But she can't make you. And eventually, even just deep down, she will get it, and understand that you're making the right decision for yourself.

I plan separate trips to see and spend time with my mom, and my brother goes on trips with the rest of the family who haven't grown the spine to cut him out yet. It works for us."
556,Sounds like you cheated and are trying to come up with excuses
557,"Gong for drinks with an opposite sex friend or colleague is fine, going for drinks with an opposite sex ski instructor who you just met is a date."
558,"He’s military, he has income that can be *easily* garnished for child support."
559,Do you have a link to that clip or an episode number?  I know a couple of people that seem to think if they stop talking they will stop breathing and I would love to see that episode.  
560,"It’s fairly common as a outfit in the US mostly amoung college students though. And mostly the same although when we go out in public he dresses up sometimes and I’ll go in leggings and a shirt with tennis shoes. And he does put effort shaving, cutting his hair etc. Maybe I’m overreacting, it just feels a little embarrassing that he has to ask me to do this because I didn’t see anything wrong with the way I was presenting myself. "
561,[removed]
562,You're completely right but I really do care about her and suddenly leaving her because of my internal problems seems very selfish. She's expressed how bad it would hurt her to lose me but she has no qualms about staying apart from me for 1 or 4  or 8 months at a time.
563,You need to make it clear to your friend that his behavior isn't ok and that next time you see or hear it happening police will be called. 
564,"I'm not saying I don't think he'd try anything. I just think it's a question of trusting the girlfriend to do the right thing.

In my case, I trust my girlfriend completely, in this scenario I know she would tell the guy she has a boyfriend, and if he tried anything then she would leave.

I think going back to the house of the ski instructor is a major red flag, but I don't see any problem with them going for a coffee or dinner."
565,All i really wanted was to have a happy life with the person i love and i feel like i tried my very best to make her happy. I think most of the people commenting here are right. But honestly i feel like i am blind and i question my own  judgment. This is why i really need someone else to judge all of this.
566,OP...ive seen this shit happen in the navy...best advice is call his command and tell them he hasnt/isnt helping you or providing for your son. That will get his attention real quick. 
567,Go fuck yourself.
568,"It was about a month ago. And yeah, it’s just so hard not talking to him everyday and hanging out together. "
569,Yeah only way I would have been said if it was like a lunch invite or something. 
570,"You shouldn't lie to someone if you don't have to. On the other hand, having an issue with her having 20 sexual partners while you have 18 is kind of hypocritical and all of that just because of a study?"
571,"Op I actually think this might be a way to make it LESS obvious you’re avoiding him. It’s easy to say you husband can’t get time off work, or you guys have a social commitment or whatnot, there’s a bunch of reasonable excuses.
Overall, how certain are you that the trip will take place and that your brother will be invited and can afford to come? I ask this because unless you’re fairly certain he is likely to attend, I don’t think I would tell your mum in advance. There’s no point bringing it up and making things awkward if he isn’t likely to come. 
You say you are afraid he would know you are avoiding him if you select overlapping dates, but how can you be sure that your mum wouldn’t flat out tell him what you’ve said about him?
You are right that this will hurt her, but I’m not convinced she will understand or accept what you’re telling her, and she may become angry with you because you are forcing her to face an unpleasant truth. 
It may be cowardly, but if he’s as evil as you make out, I think I would wait to see if he’s invited and then be vague about the reasons you and your husband can’t attend."
572,"Since you have a girlfriend I would really consider telling at least her if she doesn't know.  This isn't something that should be withheld from someone you see a future with and if you don't tell her it is likely she will find out sooner or later, be it from your brother or if you just get sloppy with clearing your browser history or closing private windows.  It will definitely be better if she hears if from you, otherwise she could end up feeling like you are using her as a beard if she finds out another way.  

&amp;#x200B;

It is obviously totally up to you to disclose that or not but I think that given your situation and your brother's gossipy GF that may be the best option.  "
573,"Your husband is using you and your child so he can get BAH and live off base.  I'm sorry, and this must be really awful, but I think this is very clear based on his behavior.  You can't tolerate this anymore."
574,"If you have to bide your time to afford to leave her, do so.  Just try to limit your exposure to her.  She will use whatever she possibly can to manipulate you into falling back into the same routine you're used to.  Including love bombing you for months on end.

She is an abuser and will always return to abusing you.

Save your money (in a place she can't reach).  Research lawyers.  Use them to figure out your next steps."
575,"Then you need to move to a different city where the COL is less, find a roommate so you're paying ike 400-500/month for rent, and start understanding what it's like to live on your own. Both you and your sister are using your parents for stability. You're not 18 or 19, you're 24.

Also you keep on harping about enjoying the small things in life. Yeah, you can do that, when you start making money to pay for life's necessities AND THEN with whats left over you can enjoy the small things.  Imagine if I just got to take my money and enjoy life's pleasures. I'd be on the street."
576,This is entirely your problem and your own insecurity. Let her go so you can work on your self esteem and probably learn how to proof read too. 
577,Maybe you and your sister could move out together after you find some employment. Even if it's a studio it will likely feel less cramped than your current house.
578,"You want what everyone wants, to love and be loved in return.

But you're not getting that from her, so why stay?

You have tried everything to make her happy, but she has not and will not return that effort. So again, why stay?

I'm sorry, waking up from this kind of denial is very very hard and upsetting.

Have you considered maybe going to counselling? Just for you. To help you figure out how you feel and what you want and how to move forward."
579,I didn't realize it was bait and switch until you pointed that out. You're totally right.
580,"I am your age and I can't even IMAGINE waking my partner up to make him cuddle ME back to sleep. Holy shit, how incredibly selfish. 

When I struggle to sleep, after he's already fallen asleep...I CUDDLE HIM. I big spoon HIM. The fact you're complaining that he didn't wake up and cuddle you *well enough*... do HIM a favor and sleep in your own damn bed.

No, it's not rude or unacceptable to want your partner to help you sleep *when they are still awake*. It is completely rude, selfish, and unacceptable to WAKE THEM UP to make them cuddle you back to sleep. "
581,"&gt; Just my opinion but in this scensrio I personally would never go for drinks with someone of the opposite sex out of respect for my partner.

Are you Mrs. Pence?  I have gone out to have beer with a two different women who are a part of our friend group before quite innocently."
582,"She's definitely wrong in pushing it on you, but in regards to the future kid situation, this hits the nail on the head."
583,Stop calling it a mistake and take responsibility. You deliberately broke the law the to benefit yourself. I've done it tons of times. Just own it and move on.

585,"Regarding fatherhood. As the child grows, the responsibility grows, and the requirements grow.

Initially they need diapers, food, and snuggles. Some rocking when they cry. The hospital nurses and assorted sisters &amp; in-laws who stop by will teach you these things. You build up from there. 


Your gf is throwing unjustified dirt at you, probably because she's terrified of dropping her commitment to her friend.  You're right, you're not qualified to babysit today. You might be able to learn though and do it. It's a growth opportunity."
586,"This is pretty much my reaction. One of the feelings that she brought up having was the feeling they it’s unfair that a guy who might have strictly platonic intentions would get shot down over a fear of him having sexual intentions. But to me, a guy in his mid 20-s trying to explicitly respect a girl’s relationship status would not invite her over to have drinks at his place after spending all day with her. 

I have a hard time believing that he could have been unaware of what it sounded like he was offering. 

We’re both on the same page with regards to how we’ll treat these situations in the future (an offer from the opposite sex to come drink at their house = declines). And so at this point I feel like I’m beating a dead horse thinking about it. She has been great communicating with me this morning (we talked for an hour at least) and I feel like we’re a lot more on the same page now "
587,"Let's look at this like grown ups, instead of crying an running away from the adult conversation. 

How much money do you bring in after taxes each month?"
588,true. sounds like OP isn't quite there just yet  but that would certainly get his attention and give him less drinking $$
589,"You should get her to delete social media. Social media is known to cause Depression and a feeling that your life sucks. She's probably always looking at what other people are doing and thinking ""Why am I not there, I wish I was there. My life sucks"" Social media is just what people put out for everyone to see. Nobody knows what's going on in their personal life, what they're struggling with. It's obvious she's addicted to social media and looking at other people's lives, it's her hobby and prevents her from having other hobbies. I recently deleted all social media except for Reddit obviously and it was the best desicion of my life. I've become more social, less caring about what people think of me, more outgoing, and overall happier in the quality of life. I no longer care about what other people did over the weekend, their new instagram posts and snapchat stories, or their new shoes.


If I were you I would have a talk with your girlfriend. Girls care more about their image and what people think of them, i know cause I am one.


I would make her delete social media. it's obviously taking over her life and draining her. She should be focusing on the relationship you guys have.
I hope you guys talk! "
590,"Stop making plans with her, she's flaky."
591,"I mean, once or twice a week really isn't an abnormal amount. This doesn't sound like you have 'little interest' at all, just a bit less than her. And I think there are lots of people who need a bit of 'freedom' after sex. To me this sounds like a simple incompatibility, not like there's something 'wrong' with you.

Whether or not this has anything to do with your past.. idk? I wouldn't say so but obviously I'm not a pro. Therapy could be really good for you anyway."
592,\^\^\^  BINGO
593,"Cut that off. Find someone who fits with you. 
Whos not want gerting fucked by some other dude"
594,"WELL, that changes things a little. Honestly it sounds like you two just have different preferred styles. (And I am super side-eyeing him here for asking that you dress up... and then making fun of you when you do. WTF?) When you two first started dating, did you dress more in your flowy tops/business casual style, or his preferred 'power couple' style? Because if he's trying to get you to change to a style of dress you've never actually been into, I... would be very skeptical of that. It's ok for a partner to ask their SO to wear something outside their natural inclinations to please them, but they have to be aware that it's a *request*, and they very well might get a no.

Also, have you expressed to him that it makes you feel *unsafe* to dress the way he wants and then go out? His first priority as a BF should be that you feel safe, and if he's asking you to do something that makes you feel unsafe - *for his gratification* \- that's not good behavior from him. It's possible you two could talk through a compromise (like romantic candlelit power couple dinner *at home*)."
595,Stop making plans with her
596,"Your mom has been a caregiver her whole life and will continue to be until your father dies. That is a hard, thankless job. One you would be doing if it werent for her. 

She could probably benefit from the support of other caregivers. There are many websites you can find and share with her. There may even be meetups. If there are, offer to stay with your dad (if he needs it) while shes out with them. Either way, she needs to get out of that house and spend time with other people. You, her mom, and her husband have been her whole world, now only 1 is left. She likely feels abandoned and lonely and is absolutely still grieving after 14 months (I actively grieved my father for 2 years and from what I'm told caregivers tend to take it harder than most). 

She would also likely benefit from therapy. Just her being able to be honest and vent about the resentment she feels (that's probably why she's cruel sometimes) toward her husband, her mom, and you would be beneficial. "
597,"I agree.  It's one thing to say ""I want my children to be close to their relatives and know that they are loved"".  It's another thing entirely to think that the only way that can happen is to live in each other's pockets and for their daily lives to be enmeshed."
598,"Don't listen to u/cheshirecat6669.

You need to leave before the abuse gets even worse. DO NOT give him time to answer. Get to a lawyer NOW."
599,Is this a cultural issue? That level of restriction is very extreme. 
600,"that would have been a MUCH better response than saying 

&gt;told her that I wasn't really interested in the responsibility

The way OP phrased it here makes it sound like he just doesn't care and is being lazy about it."
601,"Hey OP, are you any clearer on how you want to move forward after hearing the opinions given here?"
602,He will not have to see her because they have a son. Nothing will MAKE him be an involved parent. Its a choice and he has made his.
603,"&gt;I want my children to grow up with their extended family.

You know, it's one thing to say ""I want my children to be close to their relatives and know that they are loved"".  It's another thing entirely to think that the only way that can happen is to live in each other's pockets and for their daily lives to be enmeshed."
604,"Bottom line, you should wear clothes that make you feel good in whatever situation and environment you're in at the time.  If that means that most weekends you wear clean, comfy sweats, that's awesome.  If that means that every now and then you wear something stylish and sexy as a treat for your boyfriend (something that makes you feel sexy, not just something that caters to him but makes you feel vulnerable, objectified, or uncomfortable), that's awesome, too.  I'm sure you know, it's very possible to be stylish and modest at the same time - I'm guessing you've already struck that balance with your school and work wardrobes - so you don't need to turn yourself into some sort of fetish object for his gratification.

However, if his method for trying to get you to dress up is to tear you down, and/or if he's mocking you when you do dress up a bit, that's completely unacceptable.  He needs to treat you with respect, and that has absolutely nothing to do with the way you dress."
605,"Honestly, I think it takes a lot of courage to allow yourself to be vulnerable with someone else and that sort of vulnerability is how you build intimacy in a relationship. If your partner can't accept you when you're vulnerable, then they're not the right person for you. The brave thing to do is to share how you're feeling IMO, not hide them."
606,"Idk but if i was on the fence about having a kid with you at least I’d know it’s now a stupid idea. I would not have a kid with a guy that thinks watching a 1 year old for a few hours is too much responsibility.

Honestly i don’t see why it’s a big deal. Kind of on the gfs side. If you want kids this was your moment to show her you can handle it... you totally failed."
607,Sounds like your girlfriend is naive and the ski instructor may be preying on that. Also curious why finding out she was underage caused him to invite her back to his place rather than deter him from pursuing her company.
608,"What you're describing is toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity is responsible for men hiding their emotions, bottling them up, refusing to seek support and help for their mental states because it's not considered 'manly'. It's at least partly responsible for the higher suicide rate in men.

You need to just get over this. Nobody who lives in reality correlates your feelings with your gender."
609,"That's one of the big messages of society, because of the idea that masculinity necessarily means a high libido, etc, but once you start talking to people as individuals, there are lots of men who have lower libidos or who have specific needs to get the motor running.

I can't speak for the asexuals, because I'm not one, but I do know there's a lot of variety claimed under their umbrella, including being interested in masturbation but not actual partnered sex, or the ""eeeh, it's fun enough but I could happily also not ever again"" as well as ""nope no sex ever, no thanks"". It might be worth a look around the internet for an asexual community to see how you feel about it after reading up some.

However, regardless of where your low libido comes from, I really think that the fact that you started a post about your sex life and ended up writing a short story about your dysfunctional family means that you might benefit from finding a good therapist. Maybe the sex stuff is connected, maybe it's not, but sorting out your feelings about your family seems like a positive either way. Though I personally think that with that much abuse, I'm not surprised you don't desire a close relationship with them, that seems like the human relationships version of ""should I put my arm back in the bear trap? It doesn't look as sharp as it did before..."""
610,"There's nothing unmanly about having or expressing feelings other than hunger, anger, and horniness.  If there's something you're experiencing, you should absolutely be free to talk about that with your SO.  If she's got a problem with that, that's *her* problem, not yours.  Honestly, the sooner you learn whether she holds you to some unreasonable, impossible standard, the better."
611,"The entire time you have been seeing her she had been cruel, unkind, hypocritical, jealous, exercising a double standard, and almost certainly cheating.  Why the hell you ever kept seeing her is beyond me.

613,"&gt; She wants him to come with her, and it would just be the two of them all week at her fancy island house. An important note is that I’ve met all of these girls a few times and they’re very nice, albeit alcoholics, but sometimes they rub me the wrong way. Like he and one of them will go out to bars together, just the two of them. One other will model clothes and outfits for him and ask him his opinion.

&gt; her mother has said multiple times that my bf “is too young to be tied down in a committed relationship” and that her daughter (Caribbean girl) should “really try to date my bf.”

From what I have read, you have every right to set boundaries for your boyfriend or at least voice your concern about him going on a trip with a girl he knows when it will just be the two of them on an island.  The fact these girls are alcoholics shows that things can get out of hand once drinks are involved.  Regretful things.  

As for your bf being ""blind"" to this, I'd say he likes the attention.  I mean any straight guy likes how a bunch of model-type girls are interested in him to the point of inviting him out to the Caribbean?  I mean who wouldn't?

I'd voice my concern if my gf thought it would be fine to go with a guy friend by themselves for a week."

&gt;She told me that for her, the most important person is herself ...
&gt;

Well man, there's your wife and her priorities. 

You have to decide whether that's ok or not. We all build our own marriages differently. So you are faced with a wife who will not take your interests and values into account. 

(I also suspect she manipulated you at 18 for her own ends, but that's just generalized suspicion of all older people dating 18-20/yo) 

Personally, I'd suggest couple's therapy as a reasonable next step. I think I'd also contemplate divorce. "

I think he likes the idea that other men will envy him when we’re together and I dress like that."
619,"You seem to have not read the entire post. OP's husband is essentially telling his own WIFE that she and their son aren't important enough for him to man the fuck up and be the husband and father he willingly signed up to be. 

They are already married, and already have a child together, yet husband is acting like a frat boy with his shitty friends, and is using military benefits to live in off-base housing, where his wife is supposed to live with him. Instead, he has a Tinder fuckpad in which his nasty military buddies are fucking random girls and disrespecting his wife.

620,"How has no-one else mentioned this yet? OP, I don't want to be mean but come on. The way you talk about yourself is grating and the way you speak about her is insufferable and disrespectful. An 8/10? She isn't a number. Also, 'no competition'? Because of her teeth??? Holy shit. If you know her as little as you claim to, then how do you know she doesn't already have her fair share of guys that are into her? There's also very high chance she's already seeing someone/has a crush on someone else anyway. Drop the attitude, start behaving like a decent member of society and then see what happens. "
621,I have a coworker like this. I eventually just walk away or I won’t get any work done. She doesn’t even give me a chance to say “I need to get back to work.” She’s so busy talking to whoever she can that she doesn’t get any work done herself. She always has to one up everyone with some woe is me story. My supervisor never works at the same time so not much can be done bedsides ignoring her.

625,"I should add that the majority of the people that is a part of her social media routine are girls that have disrespected her at some point, and usually that person's friends.  These people are garbage human beings (cheated on their husbands, neglected their kids, divorced with no incentive of maintaining custody, etc). The only reason we knew them is because it's a small town.  The others are some shitty family members that truly are bad people.  A few off cases involve some friends of mine that have done some bad things. I maintain very loose contact with these 'friends' simply because they initiate conversation sometimes and don't live near us anymore (and don't see in person). I hate to admit it but I think she takes pleasure in these peoples misfortune. 

I've brought up the issue a few times before, and she'll try to make things right for a while but ultimately she returns to the current habit at some point.

I do know she wants to spend time with me, at least me being near her or at home.  That is not to say she's jealous because I have 0 problems when doing things on my own. I know she loves me too, but it seems like she's just 'there' when always on her phone."
626,"Why didn’t you use condoms? Or a get a vasectomy? You knew your gf’s stance on an accidental pregnancy and you still didn’t take every precaution available. That said, if you’re unhappy, you should leave and get a custody order. You also absolutely need to pay child support- you were responsible for the child’s conception as well. Don’t be a deadbeat. "
627,"She did not force anything on you.  You had the option of ALSO wearing a condom for double birth control, instead of relying on one form.  You had the option of NOT having sex if you didn't want a child.  

You act as if your life is over, but many people go to school and better their lives with a child around.  You don't have to stay together with your girlfriend, but you need to be a dad.  Stop moaning about the past and start making your life better."

I think one of us is misunderstanding the post.  I read that he is masturbating to pictures on Facebook of their friends.  It's one thing to have someone you know creep into a fantasy.  It's an entirely different thing to pull up pictures of women you know to jerk off too.  I have never done this, not even when I was 19, except obviously for women I was dating."
629,"You can break up and co-parent or pay child support. You don't have to remain with your gf. If you stay, that's a choice that you're making. It does your kid no good to have a miserable parent."
630,"Your girlfriend did everything right-- both of you did by having clear communications over a potential issue. I don't think she would have told you about this if some part of her didn't suspect something was weird about it, and even so, she also said she'd have no issue shooting him down if it came down to it. As others have said, it's only a matter of experience for her to see more clearly he's trying to bang her. 

However, trust is realizing at some point, a guy will come onto her without you knowing and you being confident in the idea she will turn him down and handle the situation appropriately. It was right to let her know it makes you uncomfortable-- these are your own feelings after all-- but she is her own person, and maintaining faithfulness should be a bare minimum of a healthy relationship, so try not to worry so much."
631,"I have the same problem as your wife but like to think I am self aware of it. When my husband does cook, he likes my company. I have a lot of opinions about what level the burner is set at, etc. It does truly bug me that he does is ""wrong"" (in my mind)and I work all the time to curb my attitude about it. I admit I am being overbearing what I do it and tell him it feels like I can't hold in the comment but I want him to ignore me because I really don't want to boss him either. My mom did this as I grew up. We often end up joking about it.

Maybe talk about setting up a funny safe word that you can use in the moment when she starts in. If she truly wants to change she will try and learn to let it go. She probably has found ways to not nag others and finds it easy to let go of that override when she's with you, but it really is better if she keeps it up. I have found that I can let go 100% and enjoy my time, but it does take effort to get in that mind frame."

&gt; I also don't want the burden of child support for a child I had no say in

You had all of the say in the *world*; you *knew* that she would keep a child if she got pregnant, and you stayed with her and had sex with her regardless.

634,Your “husband” doesn’t want to be married and be a father.  He wants to be a frat boy.  
635,"Honestly the dynamic is so weird. Unless you are ALREADY friends with them, and I mean, beyond just knowing them/being acquainted with them... it's impossible for me to believe *anyone* would think ""oh they just want to hang out as friendsssss"". I love making new friends and going out with them. IN GROUPS. One on one is a date regardless of if one of them is already attached. "
636,"No you're not in love. You are infatuated, but love is something that exists BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE. This person is in a relationship and you are only damaging yourself by carrying around these feelings. "
637,"&gt; A)  Should I tell her exactly how I feel, and potentially risk losing my friendship? 

You already told her how you felt. The ""extent"" of those feelings doesn't make a difference. Following up ""I think I like you"" with ""I'm in love with you"" months later doesn't do anything but make her reiterate her original stance: she's not interested in you that way.

&gt; B) Depending on the answer above, do you have any advice on how I should deal with it? 

You don't want to be her friend, you want to be her boyfriend. That is not possible. Since friendship isn't your goal and trying to remain friends is just making things more difficult for you, you need to step back from the friendship. You shouldn't try to remain friends with her until you actually want to be her friend. Throw yourself into other activities, meet new people, etc. Your crush will fade in time, but until it does you cannot be a good friend to her. "

639,"Age gap!! The age gap concerns me, especially since you met over 10 years ago and were really young! Can you imagine going after a 19 year old now that you're in your late 20s? That's essentially what she did, target someone young and manipulated them.

You deserve better! "
640,"Honestly, I think this is classic case of projection. She sleeps around with exes, none of her male friends are actually platonic relationship, and she casually dates/has booty calls on the side. So the moment you go out with a female friend, she assumes you must be doing the same thing to her.

Frankly, she sounds like trashy wreck. Why are you wasting your time on a manipulative, lying, self-righteous 30-something? You've got to know you didn't go through a divorce..  for this to be on the other side?

There are so much better fish in the sea. You sound like a sensitive, honest guy who tries to see the best in everyone. Find someone who actually appreciates that about you, instead of using it against you.

It sounds weird but it just seems to me that someone that goes through the trouble of sending me an actual letter on paper is putting too much effort into our relationship to also cheat at the same time. It was just a bit of mental comfort for me."

643,"Love is not all you need to make a relationship work. IMO, a healthy relationship is built upon 3 separate but equally important pillars: love, communication, and trust.

648,"You need to forgive yourself. You made a mistake, you told your boyfriend about it, and realistically nothing bad is going to come from it. Maybe it would be helpful to speak with a therapist, as your guilt sounds out of proportion to what happened.

But yea after today if she cancels, I don’t think I’m gonna try again. "
650,"Life is long, people are imperfect. In a relationship mistakes will be made. Learning how to move forward is critical.

Can you not accept you made a mistake? "

I’d leave the relationship this is so unhealthy for you. "

Would you say he's not addicted to cigarettes, in that case?"
655,"&gt; A) Should I tell her exactly how I feel, and potentially risk losing my friendship?

No.  She's still dating someone else.  Trying a hail mary ""I love you!"" isn't going to convince her to break up with her boyfriend to date you.  This is real life, not the movies.

&gt; B) Depending on the answer above, do you have any advice on how I should deal with it?

Stop focusing your attention and her and focus it elsewhere.  Work on bettering yourself and dealing with your social anxiety.  Then, you can direct your attention towards others who may be interested in dating you and are single."

657,"There's a difference between knowing what your parents would be okay with for a school trip, or even me signing something for my husband of nearly 6 years, and what OP did, in my opinion. Like, my husband and I have legal rights ans responsibilities to each other and school trips aren't that big a deal. But this is something I would not have taken for granted when me and my husband were 'just' living together. While it may have actually been 100% fine, it still breaks some principles of trust because it involves financial and possible legal remidies."
658,"Yes, but you and Kate have something in common. They're so different. I think the only reason they're friends is that they've known each other for so long.  
You're great! I feel a bit better knowing it's possible to get used to this."
659,"US immigration is shit.

You don't need a lawyer to sponsor her for citizenship as a fiancee.

You do need to prove the ability to support her on a single income - which you do not have and won't have for probably until after you are done with school and college.

Finally - please don't take it the wrong way - but you're 17. Trust me on this, you don't want to spent the next 5 years in some ""long distance"" relationship while you ignore the women around you.

Also do not assume that if she comes over - everything just works out.


It didn't for me - and the girl I sponsored had been someone who I had kept in touch with since I was 7 years old, dragged her over to the states at 22, and it all fell apart. We were great together as bf/gf when we traveled together or she visted, we were great long distance - we thought we were totally inseparable and nothing would keep us apart - ever - after all we had been keeping in touch all this time - surely it would work - but living together just didn't work at all.

I'm not saying that you should break up with her right away - what I am saying is that you stay realistic about the relationship and the fact that the odds of it working out are extremely slim. "
660,"Like everyone else, I recommend therapy for him -- especially as you're going LD. You're smart to be thinking that his trust issues will worsen. He needs to be in a situation in which he learns to systematically retrain his irrational thoughts and replace them with rational ones."
661,"&gt; The pain was so bad that he was crying. It broke my heart because I have never seen him like this. I was about ready to call 911 but he begged me not to.

Yeah this is tough love draw a line in the sand time. He has to go see a doctor. You should have probably ignored him and called 911 anyway. "
662,"On one hand, I find ""don't watch porn or masturbate"" to be a very controlling boundary. It's not exactly unheard of, but it's definitely unusual and it's normal to feel a little put off. It also makes me wonder what your future is with this woman - will she be holding this resentment forever? Do you see yourself marrying her, having kids, and 20 years later she's still saying you're going to cheat on her? There has to be a path that ends in ""and then the relationship returns to trust and healthy boundaries"". If the rest of your relationship is going to be mistrust, then there's no point.

On the other hand, it's not exactly normal to feel unable to resist looking at women naked. While the restriction came from a bad place, I'm not sure it's a bad decision for you anyway - a deep need to see other women's bodies is concerning and very much not a normal impulse.

This makes it really hard to give advice here, because this is probably good for you in the long run but not necessarily good for the relationship."
663,"I’ve seen this happen with a fair number of lesbians who identify as asexual and later realize that they just hadn’t considered being sexually attracted to women. We (as lesbians, I mean) face a lot of pressure to be sexually attracted to men and only men, and so even once we realize that we may romantically be into women the sexual attraction part isn’t always recognized. Of course, the way that you identify is up to you, but based off of what you’ve said (and your comments regarding boyfriends you’ve felt emotionally close to) you might just be a lesbian. Or at least into men and women romantically, but sexually attracted to women. Good luck! "
664,"Jimbo was saying that BetiGrewUp missed your point, Duffman - they weren't criticising anything you said"
665,"These people sound pretty awful, all of them. Including Mike. Why would you even want to stay in a relationship with him or be around them?

&amp;#x200B;

If you stay with Mike, it sounds like you need to accept that he will continue to throw you under the bus, if it suits him. You also now know that Anna is totally untrustworthy - though honestly, it sounds like you could have had this conversation about Sally without calling her names; it would have been the more mature thing to do. But to get back to the main point - all these people sound awful, and it seems you'd be better off without them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you said that Mike is great other than these people, but it sounds like these people are a huge part of his life, so I'm not seeing how it could be that great. And even if Mike is the world's most awesome dude, part of who he is is the people he associates with. And if he's OK with his friend's being shitty to the people he dates, then he's not awesome or a good person to be in a relationship with. 

&amp;#x200B;

AND he and Sally exchanged nudes before! So it doesn't even sound like he's an upstanding guy.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: All these people are trainwrecks - dump, block, move on. Maybe spend some time in therapy learning a bit more about you and why you were willing to be treated like crap by this dude's friends (while he passively stood by and watched, from the sound of it) for a year and a half instead of walking away the first time it happened and Mike didn't have your back. "
666,"I'm not sure if you're in the UK or not, but you could always just invite her over for a cup of tea! Just say you want to get to know your neighbours more and slip a note under her door. Then the ball is kind of in her court but also you've reached out and given her the opportunity if she wants a chat or some company :) "
667,"I used to be sorta like him. When me and my husband were about 6 months into dating I started to feel really insecure. I got paranoid that maybe he was cheating or that he would cheat. I have abandonment issues from my mom leaving us as a child and I was so afraid that he would stop loving me.

In the first few months I didn't worry about much, but as time went on I was like ""Oh, shit this is my longest and first serious relationship. I love this dude and I really don't want him to leave me."" I needed constant reassurance from him. Eventually after a while I stopped worrying about it. I realized that he did in fact love me very much and he wasn't going to leave. After 3 years of marriage and a 4 month old baby I definitely know he's not going anywhere and I don't have the fear I once did :) It just took time and reassurance to get over it, but for your boyfriend it may take therapy. It's different for everyone."
668,You’re husband is immature. He’s not ready to be a “husband” per se . Cut him loose and let him run free

Ask her. I think odds are in your favor. "
671," You comes across as a giant jerk. She helps you financially, fucking help her out and give her some money to assist in her setting herself up and let her take the damn chair she paid for. Stop being petty. "
672,I will suggest it! 
673,"Because I felt he wasn't attracted to me (girls).  I had this happen to me back in my late teens with an ex (now bff) that ""wasn't interested in sex"". A 18/19 year old not interested in sex? Yeah, he was gay. And he loves sex, just not with me. "
674,Have you talked to a therapist about this?
675,"Yes, but don't confuse I statements with just starting every sentence with ""I feel like."" Make damn sure you are following this format: When you \[insert behavior\], that makes me feel \[an actual emotion, not just your opinion\]. 

To illustrate the difference: 

""I feel like you are fucking rude to me.""

""When your tone of voice sounds harsh, I feel scared and upset that you might abandon me.""

The first one is just stating your opinion with ""I feel like"" in front of it. (Words that are completely unnecessary, btw.) The second one clearly identifies a behavior, then clearly identifies the emotion that behavior causes. You can test yourself by removing ""I feel like"" from the beginning of the sentence. What do the words after that convey? In the case of this example, it's just ""You are fucking rude to me,"" which is such a discrete statement and subjective at that, what can anyone say to that aside from either, ""No, I'm not,"" or ""Well, that wasn't \*my intention."" 

This is a great way to avoid name calling and using superlative statements that are rarely accurate, i.e., ""you always,"" ""you never."" The other thing is it helps you to not actually criticize the other person or blame the conflict on their personality or some other thing that they cannot change. But we are all in control of our behavior, so being aware of what emotions your behavior evokes can certainly increase the levels of mutual empathy. 

Now, go tell your wife that you're sorry you scared the shit out of her by not responding and see if she apologizes for overreacting. I mean, she could have stepped out into the yard and asked if you could hear her, right? 

Couples counseling will teach you how to fight fair and still be considerate of each other's feelings. Never, ever apologize with ""I'm sorry you feel that way,"" because that is the most passive aggressive non-apology that exists. Whenever you apologize, identify the behavior you are sorry for. Say what you did. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Which brings me to another point. Your intent is irrelevant. I might not have intended to get drunk and kill somebody from drunk driving (fictional example), but that doesn't mean I'm not responsible for my behavior. It's not your *intent* that matters, it's the *effects* of your words and actions on other people that matters. "
676,"I’ve been bottling it up, mostly. I’ve been *so* successful at this new job. Already got a raise and a promotion. But I feel so guilty because the whole thing has been built in a lie. At least, that’s how I see it in my mind. :( "
677,"Although Chris acted very inappropriately, it's very very important you recognize that for many people, having such a close relationship with a (relatively) recent ex will be a giant breach of trust. This is no fault of anyone, but some people won't mind that at all, and some will find it very uncomfortable and very untrustworthy.


I don't think it's healthy or fair for SO's to say who you can and can't be friends with, but it's also very important to understand the different boundaries that individuals may have. Especially recognize that your boundaries may be incompatible with those of some people. 


Hell, read this sub long enough and you'll see dozens of posts of people upset over sexual infidelity but not minding emotional infidelity alongside swingers having marital issues because they hang out with their additional partners too much outside of the bedroom. It all comes down to the individual! "
678,"Counseling. 

 if I say 'thanks for dinner' when we ate our midday meal, his response is going to be 'you mean lunch' instead of 'you're welcome'. It's the impulse to correct being stronger than bring polite or considerate. This happened and I blew up at him saying ""Did you understand what I f**king meant?"" 

It was an issue for a while because even when I said ""I'm having a hard time with my dad's estate, I really need some encouragement"" 

His response: ""I don't know anyone who could've done it better... You know, with no experience or training."" 

We talked to a humanistic counselor who was great at drawing out some of the reasons and motivations behind his behavior and helped me express feeling like he just didn't put in the effort to balance the things I do well with the corrections. And that the corrections were more important than keeping his mouth shut and letting it go.

It helped me to understand what I was doing that bothered him sometimes too.

Approaching your wife about this could be tricky. Explain that you are feeling like she's being too controlling over the small details and it's taking away from the experience of being married

OP explains their situation at the time and honestly I can see how you could make that decision in a split second and under stress. What about kids who forge a signature on a sick note? Should that eat at them? We aren’t all perfect and hindsight is a wonderful and terrible thing. How many things would you change if you could do over? 

The fact they feel this guilty is a good sign that they aren’t likely to move on to stealing money or drowning kittens. "
682,"I finally got Mike to reach out to Jake to ask why he even went to Sally and Roger in the first place. Jake made it known again that this was totally my fault. Mike never responded to Jake's text. And then Mike spent the rest of the day hysterical (to the point that his Mom had to come over), saying he didn't know what to do and wasn't sure if I could come home. And then he admitted again that he threw me under the bus and that I didn't do anything wrong. This is just such a childish mess."
683,"It was awful. He had just put pants on, his belt was undone, and he was shirtless. Pretty sure he had just got done banging his gf. *cringe*"
684,I’d wager that most men who are exclusively addicted to m/f porn aren’t gay. 
685,"&gt; He's always recognised that I have not done anything wrong, even in the beginning.

It's heartening that he realizes that this is not a you issue, but a him issue. So he's not abusive, you know? Hope you can work this out with him, and that he can work out his trauma so he can fully enjoy your relationship. You sound like a very good gf. Good luck, OP."
686,"What a POS. I'm so sorry that this has happened. I would lawyer up quickly and, if you haven't been, record your phone calls and save your text exchanges.

It seems that your husband wants to live the single life, so let him and begin healing. Claim your freedom back."
687,Definitely tell your brother. She sounds like a future female stalker. Her obsession sounds very unhealthy. And could possible do something stupid. Telling your brother will help him be aware of her obsession and he can be more careful in interacting with her. Should also have a talk with her and tell her your concerned about her mental health.
688,"Kids forge signatures on sick notes and things all the time. I’m not saying what you did was as trivial as that or in anyway ‘good’ but it’s not exactly terrible. Your BF forgave you, you can forgive yourself. 

Next time you are in such a situation ask your boyfriend or whoever first. Simple solution. No beating yourself up required! :) "
689,"Yeah, that's a no from me. It *might* be different if there were a bunch of people going, but just her &amp; him. Hell to the no. "
690,"The first thing to do is be honest in therapy, so they have the whole picture.  Without that information, they have an incomplete picture of the situation."
691,"""Wife, I am starting to feel neglected and distant in our relationship for X, Y, and Z reasons. I need more physical intimacy together. How can we work together to solve this issue?""

Honestly, this may be something you need couples counseling to solve at this point. "
692,Also if his friends are living with him and the apartment is on base they are violating the base housing restrictions  and can be punished for it.
693,"&gt; She grabbed a pair of his dirty boxer briefs. I saw and told her to drop them and she did. Not long after I saw them in her purse and she has no idea I know

That's not just crossing the line, that's going so far over the line that you can't see the line anymore. 

1. Tell your brother immediately
2. Have a very serious talk with your friend and tell her that your friendship is in jeopardy of ending due to her actions "
694,[removed]
695,"I agree with this comment completely - it's not up to her who babysits her friends child, and it is not appropriate for her to ask you. 

I do, however, see a little bit of the point she's making. If you want kids in the near future, and you've never changed a baby, and you are currently using that as a reason not to babysit, will you be expecting her to do all of that? She may have inferred from your argument that you will not be a hands on parent, and will expect her to carry, birth and then raise a child that she mostly doesn't want. You say you are sensitive about the fact that she says she won't have kids, but it is also likely she is sensitive to the fact that you do. Therefore, some of the reason she may be so upset at the moment, might stem from this point of tension in your relationship. 

I suggest that you suggest to her letting her friend know she is unable to help her this time. Once you've had that discussion, it might be worth talking about what ""having children in the near future"" looks like to you - what kind of parent and partner you expect to be.l, what that means for your respective education's/careers. Many relationships between people that do want children and those who don't often end, sometimes after a long time of one placating the other, and communication on this issue is very important for compatibility."
696,"Having been a 19 year old girl, yes I can fully believe someone is this naive, and trusting. Women are socialized to trust men and take them at face value and believe them. For some of us, it's only hard experience that turns us doubtful and untrusting."
697,Right? I just asked my boyfriend (he's in his 20's) and he said he thinks it's weird as hell.
698,She can just call JAG and they will handle the divorce. Its free for her as a military spouse. She will get a cut of his pay and housing allowances because of the child. 
699,"let that baggage go, bro. how invested is she if she can't deal with your relationship issues without finding comfort with another man? I'd block and move on. "
700,"As a guy who has/had many single friends that are ski/snowboard instructors, he was definitely trying to fuck your girlfriend. "
701,This!!! He’s single outside of the paperwork. I’m sure he’s mingling too
702,"Do you even have any way to contact her? Also, a few lovely conversations are great, but that doesn't mean you're not in vastly different places in your life or that she'd be interested in you in return. "
703,Cool sorry for the confusion.
704,I’ve definitely never done that. Why on earth would I? 
705,"You're probably not wrong, your rational is sound but I think you handled things poorly.  You had a real chance to man up and help your girlfriend out but instead you shrunk away and argued.  You are a 30 year old man who wants kids but is afraid of being left alone with an infant.  I can see how that could be both a red flag about the future a disappointing moment for her. 

I am not trying to tear you down just lend a little perspective.  Partners constantly let each other down, if it's not babysitting its cleaning, or holding down a job, or a thousand other things.  It's just part of it, make peace and move on.

Its probably not the best idea to trust an inexperienced babysitter, either.  "
706,"I assume it's a difficult place to be, perhaps you want to establish some basics first before going into the ring. 

1) Does she already have a boyfriend

2) What's her age (if she's asian probably she looks WAY younger than she actually is)

3) Some means to contact her outside of uber

&amp;#x200B;

Once you get those, and if shes like OK to date (Legal I guess), take a risk and ask her out to dinner, maybe? I'd say approach with caution - maybe she just talks back to you not to be rude, or out of genuine interest. Does she initiate conversation or is it just you? do you just talk about the weather or something a little more personal? Depends on all of those I guess. But #3 would be a good way to keep the line open ;)"
707,"I love him for separate reasons to my ex. 
Completely. 
Despite the previous more interesting sex life, I would never return to him. 
Yes I understand he would be upset, it’s not something I would tell him directly though, I have discussed with him, it would be so nice if one day you.... I would love if one day you just.... 
I’m giving up trying because it doesn’t seem to be in him to be dominant. It’s not his preference, he’s too gentle. (Maybe better suited to somebody else)
I wouldn’t mind somebody throwing me on the bed and seducing me. 
In the time with this partner I’ve never once been seduced. There’s zero foreplay and zero sexual drive. 
I was confronted by his ex partner who disclosed she felt undesired and unloved and from my knowledge, on separation she went to sleep with twenty plus men in a matter of months. 

It’s not exactly great for your self esteem when you always have to initiate sex. 
I explained it’s always me pursuing sex, never once has he initiated it. 
Don’t get me wrong, in every aspect elsewhere he’s an amazing person and gentleman. I’d just like somebody a bit more dominating and bossy around the bedroom. A bit of tit grope, hair pulling, pin my hands down wouldn’t go a miss. "
708,Is the alcohol responsible for the NICU situation?
709,"2/3 commentors are assholes apparently so I'll help. So first of all, unless you actually see her again, don't contact her because you would just be using her Uber info and EVERY woman finds that shit to be hella creepy. The only thing you can do is hope she shows up again and if she does, just be brave and ask her out. Worst that can happen is she says no. If you're 52, surely you're not still so fragile that the possibility of a simple no could stop you chasing your dreams. Good luck!"
710,[removed]
711,"I've always wondered this. I was cheated on in my first relationship so I've been curious how someone in your shoes were filled. Whether you take it as a compliment that a trustworthy (well, not so much) man cheated to be with you. It's a bit surprising to me that you can hold a man like this in such high regard, but I suppose cheating isn't a huge no-no for you.

Either way, regarding your question, if this girl has any self-respect, she won't steal your man away since your boyfriend was a piece of shit to her. So for her sake, I hope she has moved on and found someone who is much more trustworthy and respectful. 

That being said, I think you can ease up on your insecurities."
712,"You are 24 spending so much time stressing over this. Arguing daily isn’t normal. Arguing from November to March isn’t normal. You’re in a LDR constantly worried about what she’s doing and who she’s with when she’s proven to be untrustworthy before. I know it hurts like hell (I’ve been I’m a similar situation), but you would end up feeling so much better if you just ended it."
713,He did not mark it. He checked after I just told him and said he didn't mark it.
714,Do you even know her name? I honestly don't know how people can claim to be in love with someone when they know next to nothing about them. This is just a crush. Let her live her life and date men her own age.
715,This does not fall under the type of information a therapist can break privilege for.
716,"It is not an easy situation and thanks for not being aggressive like most of the replies. For what I understand she doesnt have a bf, I was too scared to ask for her age but she is more than 18 because her destination is always her job and no she is not asian.

It was me who started the conversation and the first time she was clearly nervous but the other times she looked normal. It's really difficult and I don't understand why it is seen as ""creepy"", just for example when I was 18 years old it was OK to think that 18 year old girls were attractive, well this doesn't change with age, they can be attractive to men of any age but there's a lot of negativity if I like a legal, younger girl. "
717,This isn’t love. It’s infatuation. You don’t know this girl.  Anything you do to try and pursue her based on the information you have would likely come across as inappropriate. I’m sorry. 
718,"&gt;Backstory on this last comment: about two years ago the topic of having kids came up. I want to have kids sometime in the near future, girlfriend never wants to give birth or have a child ever, but says maybe possibly one day she'll want a kid, but constantly when drunk/high/around other people brings up how terrible, gross, annoying it would be to have kids.

This woman is lying to you, she does not want kids. Are you ready to give up that dream to be with her?"
719,"This is interesting, because just from reading the title, I actually came into the post with exactly the same opinion as you. I thought it was a straightforward case where the babysitting argument was the only argument and OP was being pushed to look after a child when they didn't want to and didn't feel ready, and I was completely on his side.

Then I started reading the post and saw more and more things that made me go ""huh?"" Just in the neutral sense of, wait, this story is odd. He's the one who wants kids and she doesn't... but she has regular babysitting experience and he has none? She just randomly came out with this unreasonable request for him to babysit on his own, out of nowhere? When she's never had any problem babysitting for her sister before?

What I'm trying to say is, I think people's reactions to OP are varying wildly based on whether they felt a ""left turn"" while reading their story."
720,"In what context did you see her another 4 times? Were these dates, or did you drive her again? Did you go out of her way to seek her out? I definitely need more information, because if these were not dates, you are being INCREDIBLY creepy right now. This legitimately sounds like the beginning of a horror movie. As a young woman myself, I can't even begin to tell you how nerve-wracking it is to be in Ubers or other vulnerable situations where I'm literally PRAYING AND HOPING that my driver doesn't cross any lines or try to hit on me - or worse. As her Uber driver you have crossed so many boundaries already. You even asking for her facebook is incredibly inappropriate, and the fact she said she ""doesn't really use it"" is a CLEAR SIGN SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HAVE HER PERSONAL INFORMATION. Trust me, I've said this exact same thing to get out of giving my contact info to creepy older men while still being polite. I am almost 100% sure that if she was talking to you in the Uber, she was just TRYING TO BE NICE AND NOT GET KILLED BY A STRANGE MAN SHE IS TRUSTING TO GET HER WHERE SHE NEEDS TO GO. You are crossing so many boundaries it's unbelievable. She may be a TEENAGER. It doesn't matter if she's of legal age - you need to step back immediately."
721,"Yeah, I get that it’s a natural part of adjusting to new relationship, but we’ve been together for over six months now and things don’t seem to change. I genuinely want to grow to like his friends and I’m definitely not like “it’s me or them”, but I’m slowly starting to feel like I don’t really want to go if I know we’re going to meet in a group.

I try not to overreact and not to force anything on my bf, but like I’ve said - most of my friends live out of town, so we don’t see them as often as his friends and I’d like to enjoy our outings together instead of forcing myself to sit through them.

I’ve always tried not to make big deal out of it and the only time I’ve mentioned it to my bf was after one particular evening when his best friend’s gf (who used to be friends with my bf’s ex, but isn’t anymore) spent most of the time going over the summer trip where my bf and his ex met and how it was so cool, and how they all did this and that, while also avoiding any kind of conversation with me. I mean I get, it was a nice summer, but it was almost ten years ago, one would think that they’ve made nice memories which aren’t such a potentially touchy and alienating subject. I felt it was a bit weird, considering she’s not even friends with my bf’s ex anymore (I would sort of get it if she was still friends with her, you know, it would be natural to feel some resentment towards me).
 
On a side note, I don’t think I fully agree on the replacement part, since most (not all ofc) relationships end because people are looking for something else in a relationship. I know that what I had with my ex and what I have with my current boyfriend are two entirely different things and I wouldn’t consider it “a replacement” and vice versa - my boyfriend’s past relationship is completely different than ours. "
722,"Of course I know her name, this is information you can see as an uber driver "
723,This made me laugh TBH
724,"You asked permission and if Boss A, remembered, you're covered. Next time, get it in email/writing. Very important. "
725,"In the future, make sure any vacation requests are done in writing so he can't go back and say he doesn't remember.

As far as this trip is concerned; enjoy your vacation. He'll calm down."
726,Usually they are ok as long as I am not constantly taking time off and always tell them before hand. That’s why i was so shocked he was pissed..
727,"No, you’re right that I’m making excuses for myself.  I make enough to live with a roommate if I really wanted, but I don’t.  I still have this unshakable feeling that I’d be making a huge mistake by leaving him and that I’ll never find anyone like he used to be at the beginning of our relationship and I just hope he’ll come back to me.  We had our millionth conversation last night about me wanting to leave and he threw all the same promises at me again that I know are bullshit but god I just want it so bad to be true, I want to give him the chance if it means my soulmate coming back."
728,"I just want to say that it sounds like you guys have a great relationship. She was trying to navigate the tricky space that some guys like to put women into ""it's just a hangout/drink at my place"" and because they haven't been explicit about romantic intentions, you feel it would be rude to say ""I have a boyfriend"" or ""I'm not going to sleep with you"". Because she's so young and she's likely often going out with you, it's probably a new experience for her. Seems like you helped her work through it.

It sounds like you both did a great job about being honest about your feelings and boundaries. It's generally a bad idea for women to drink alone in strange men's homes (even if they seem nice at first). This guy threw up some red flags by changing the bar plan to a ""my place"" plan. Even if he was just a cool guy who wanted to make a new friend (not likely IMO), it was the right call for her to bail. You setting boundaries and sharing your feelings may have given her the ""permission"" she needed for herself to do the slightly rude thing and bail on the plans. 

Anyways, way to go on being a great boyfriend! It sounds like you were a good listener, shared your feelings and did it in a way that wasn't like ""laying down the law"" or being controlling. "
729,"Sounds like you had a physically and emotionally abusive childhood, have been betrayed by authority figures you were taught to trust, and now have some pretty strong aversions to intimacy. I'd say that all lines up pretty neatly, OP. 

Have you unloaded all this on a therapist before? If I were you, I'd be looking earnestly for an impartial, professional third party who could sit there while I got all this out of my head. Not that therapy is a magic bullet, but I had some, uh, childhood traumas also, and it feels much better to exorcize them from my head so I can straighten out the crooked thoughts. 

My therapist helps me question some of the programming I took onboard from my family as a kid, lots of it stuff I never thought to question on my own. It's amazing how much childhood abuse will teach you to grow up and abuse yourself without anyone else's help! "

736,"Other commenters have said pretty much the same, but I wanted to chime in and say it would be so nice of you to just stop by and check in on her!

749,"You should have just told him something along the lines of ""hey I'm going to sign this with your name for (generic reason)."" But This is not something to get upset about in the first place. If he's over it, get over it. Done."

Dressing up for him makes him feel wanted and desired. Its pretty simple, actually.

I think you should compromise. Maybe you put on some sexy lingerie and fix your hair every once in a while. Maybe he puts more effort into his look as well, maybe you shop together once in a while and get something you know he likes and wear it occasionally. 
"
751,Honestly doesn't seem like that big of a deal and you should get over it. 
752,"&gt;  so I could evaluate my options.

Here are your options.

1. Stay with her.
2. Break up with her.

That's it.  Either way you are a father and need to do right by your child.  "
753,"She’s unlikely to give up her writing, especially when she’s so successful. Rights don’t really come into it— you can divorce her for any or no reason, or stay despite anything.  

Lots of people work out crushes and fantasies, though. Yes, she damaged the relationship by saying she doesn’t like you to friends and talking about plans to cheat, no matter how unlikely the opportunity to cheat with the rock star is.

But if you want this to work, both of you need to do what everyone with sexual fantasies beyond the relationship, which is almost every one, does:

— take protections so it doesn’t f up your real life. 

— don’t rub the partner’s nose in it and don’t snoop

— take care of your partner’s sexual needs and respect their boundaries 

—honour your promises


By talking about you to friends,using rock star’s name, she’s messing up the first one. Idk if he could sue for fanfic, I guess not, but it’s messed up. By putting it on her personal social media, she’s embarrassing you and could mess up her office job career. Did she really think rock star would sleep with her? That’s certainly not respecting your boundaries.

She sounds like a typical 16 year old, tbh. Maybe you’ve outgrown her. "
754,"Sure, I guess, it's all conjecture though. Taking medication doesn't mean she is infirm though, and living alone is hardly unusual. This woman seemed rather embarrassed by the check-up. Going further to suggest that you want to help pick-up groceries or other tasks is even more wild to me. To me it really strongly suggests that this lady is infirm. 

I feel like if she was infirm OP would have suggested as such. I don't think advice stating to treat her this way is reasonable. "
755,bitey mccrazy pants buahahahaha!
756,"She has it all right now - you two are broken up, so she has no obligations to you, yet you are still paying for everything. Win, win for her and lose, lose for you. Maybe you should try standing up for yourself instead of being her perpetual victim."
757,"Do not do this. Do not do this, ever, and stop turning uber on when you are near her house. Stop driving by her house. Stop searching for her. This is terrifying. "
758,"&gt; First, I watched porn and masturbated almost every day (this didnt seem to affect my performance with her) 

Maybe excessive, but that's not really for her to decide. If it's not affecting the relationship then it's not really her business. If this was just about proving that you have it under control and it's not an addiction, then 4 months is plenty long enough.

&gt; Second, she felt that this is a sexual impulse that is out of my control and feels that if I am unable to control this kind of temptation I wont be able to control the temptation to cheat on her in the future. 

Bullshit. You're having sex with her regularly, so clearly the desire to masturbate is a separate issue. If anything, it makes you *less* likely to cheat because you're channeling your natural inclination for variety into fantasy instead of pursuing it in reality.

&gt; Third, she thinks it is childish and unattractive. 

Again, not really for her to decide. You know what's really childish and unattractive? Trying to tell someone what they can do with their own body.

This has nothing to do with masturbation and everything to do with control. She wants to have that power over you, to alleviate her own insecurities and maybe even as a means of punishing you for the crime of sleeping with someone else while you were broken up. Drawing a hard line on this wouldn't put you at risk of losing a relationship over porn, but losing a relationship because your controlling partner doesn't accept that you have agency over your own body."
759,"""I point out how she behaved when we got together and she complains she’s sick of being made out to be a bad person.""

But she *is* a bad person. 

She's abusive: biting you (you should have had her arrested btw), invited you over just to berate or call the cops on you, trying to isolate you from friends, yelling and insulting you when you have a normal boundary request in regards to joining her at the bar with her ex.

She's a total hypocrite: you're not allowed to have a totally normal and appropriate friendship, but meanwhile she gets to shack up with an ex for a month while he puts in a new kitchen (...did she pay him or?).

Aside from that she sounds incredibly emotionally immature and way too old to be doing this shit. And you're too old to be putting up with it. You're not teenagers, relationships shouldn't be this upsetting and draining this early or really ever. Just pull the fucking plug and tell her exactly why, preferably in a public place or on the phone since she's violent. Maybe she'll learn something and get some much needed therapy. 
"
760,"Maybe I’ve just got an extremely cynical world view but knowing someone so under legal drinking age and suggesting they come back to drink with you alone doesn’t sound like an innocent suggestion.

If it was a situation where it was a long time friend of hers I think your concerns would be valid but I think you’re on the money in this situation."
761,"Especially since he works in a tourism industry. He's just smashing girls on vacation, there's no real repercussions for people cheating, if they don't get caught. "
762,"Sure, that might be taking it too far, but OP is simply asking if she should make contact with the neighbor to offer her phone number. I think that's pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things."
763,"Maybe she is depressed or suffering from anxiety disorder. Maybe she jsut doesn't like you.

The why DOES NOT MATTER. What matters is that you have asked her to stop, you have explained how this decreases your quality of life and she is NOT LISTENING. She is not changing her behavior to improve your life. That is VERY concerning. 

Do you have kids? does she do this to the children? If so, you need to step in and get this to stop no matter what it takes. This kind of behavior is very damaging to children 

I suggest couples counseling, ASAP. "
764,"Please don’t. 

Jeebus, I wish there was some way to warn the poor girl. I hope she reports you to Uber if you do something that inappropriate, but most likely she will stop using Uber so she doesn’t have to deal with you. I can guarantee she is getting a creepy vibe from you. "
765,"First, you can't dictate what kind of comments you are going to get. Everyone is entitled to post their own thoughts. Majority of people are trying to help you not scar a young girl.

Second, you are going to make this poor girl so uncomfortable if you ask her out. Please leave her alone. You don't know her AT ALL, you are over twice her age, and you meet her through work. It's so inappropriate. When I was her age I had older men hit on me, all it did was make me feel super creeped out and uncomfortable. 

Thirdly, I don't say this to be mean..but getting therapy might not be a bad idea. Maybe to try and understand why you want to date someone who could be your daughters age and why you are ""in love"" with someone you chatted with a few times at work. "
766,"If you want to nuke all the trust in your relationship because of your past history, go nuts I guess. Otherwise, I'd recommend therapy. This is just going to follow you and ruin every healthy relationship you have unless you put an end to it. You're going to end up with another paranoid and jealous controlling person in a toxic relationship without mutual trust if you keep it up."
767,Diabetics can eat cake - no worries :) its all about the amount of it in one sitting. 
768,"&gt;Like, do you not expect to be told to remove your heavy fur coat when meeting with a medical professional?

She was stopping by to make an appointment--not be seen by the dentist. He happened to ask if he could take a look at the tooth, which she didn't expect since she only went in to make an appointment. "
769,"I would suggest looking into therapy and doing extensive reading on objectification. Have you ever become infatuated like this before? If not, what's going on right now that you're laser focused on this individual? Was it something specific she did or said or maybe she reminds you of a time when you were happier?  


I'm legitimately not trying to give you a hard time here. You probably feel all the strong emotions you describe, but you need to understand them a little better. If you let yourself linger on the cycle of desire&gt;pining&gt;desire, you'll make yourself sick."
770,"Wow. You buried the lede there, OP. I'm not gonna say anything about your childhood because that's beyond our pay grade but I'm so very, very happy for you that you're in a loving relationship now cuz you deserve it, and I hope this advice helps!

Is there any way you can express affection/love in a different form? I've been with people who weren't that touchy/feely but they still made me feel loved and adored. Whether it's a text when you're away from her for the day, reminding her that you love her, complimenting her on specific attributes/body parts (of course you love her for more than that, but if she's got a bangin' butt, admire it!)

Last thing I will recommend is giving her massages. It seems like she really likes being touched and it has several benefits for y'all

1) She gets her needs fulfilled (a lot of touch)

2) You limit what you don't like (being touched, as you're just using your hands)

That way she'll be fully relaxed. Seriously. She'll love it, she'll probably think you're the most freakin' amazing guy on the planet for being that giving, AND you get out of the stranglehold! Just look up some techniques and don't put too much muscle into it, be gentle, you aren't trying to work out knots. If you want to be extra fancy use some massage oil/coconut oil (just a couple drops, not a huge dollop)."
771,"Money makes people act weirdly. In my (limited) experience, the more money one is used to, the more of an ""issue"" it is. I'm sure there are exceptions.

To be clear, I'd be upset if my husband did this to me before we were married (though I've definitely grown up solidly working class), but it wpuld have nothing to do with trust. I would not like someone else making a decision like this for me, even if I 100% would have signed that piece of paper. But I need to make that decision for myself and it's not someone elses to make.

It's been a year and this is still weighing on you though. You need to either have a conversation with your boyfriend, or a therapist, or maybe both. It's not healthy to hold on to something for this long."
772,"Sounds like a bad idea. This is assurance seeking, but over time the effect tends to be less important. Then you'll be worrying about hidden phones/apps and other skeevy shit he can't provide, if he's a reliable guy. He'll have to always put his privacy on the block or the relationship is in trouble. Makes one feel unsafe in this bond eventually.

Try counseling, so you can talk about the true bad people: your parents. Your dad was a cheater, but your mom stayed. It's a dynamic, both pingponging back, not just one side causing the drama. With a counselor you can talk safely, talk about all the things your boyfriend does that remind you of your parents, without impacting him. That person can help you find coping strategies for your fears then. "
773,"idk i guess i think there's a relationship problem happening that's bigger than ""whoops suddenly got unattractive"" if he's masturbating to porn every day but not wanting intimacy w his SO"
774,"What is especially scary is it’s not a much older man hitting on her in public, at a bar or party with people around. She will be alone in his car, with him in control of the vehicle. This is exceptionally scary because she will feel trapped and most likely very, very unsafe. This poor fucking girl. "
775,"You're jumping to conclusions. PLENTY of men and women use the months of pregnancy to better situate their lives for childrearing, whether that means moving house, learning hands-on skills, changing jobs, or getting therapy. To suggest that he'll be an inept novice father because he's not willing to bend to her absolutely irresponsible demand is pretty unfair."
776,"Uhhh this is giving me a bad unhealthy vibe. Trust is such an important part of a healthy relationship. You can’t have a strong, long lasting relationship without any trust. Especially if he hasn’t given you any reason to not trust him and you’re just paranoid.

Men are not generally pigeon boxed into this one kind of behavior like your father proclaims. And probably used these excuses to justify his selfish behavior. Some people do find monogamy difficult, and some people don’t. I honestly believe asking this of your boyfriend will kill his trust and will negatively affect your relationship with him.

It’s hard to love someone who just can’t trust you. I suggest you get some help professionally to deal with this inner paranoid of yours. Plus a professional will be able to help you and your boyfriend over come this together. "
777,Do you want a restraining order? This is how you get a restraining order. 
778,"When are you moving out? If it's a long time still, better get help now, then you at least have support til you're out. "

780,I'm completely shocked that he even cared in the first place.  I've done this tons of times with my wife during our entire relationship.
781,"Why exactly did you block her tho, seems like such a childish move. No offence. I understand why you’re worried (that guy is basically a pedo), in the end it’s her choice, not yours. Maybe tell her parents if you feel like he’s a weirdo."
782,"If you have asked him a million times already and you've discussed it, know this... it's not going to change. Which means you have to make a decision, is it worth it? Can you accept these things as they are or is it going to come to a head? It's up to you on what you will and will not accept as tolerable. You may not be able to change him, but you can change how you react to it. "
783,"She thinks it's social, she doesn't see the risks. He is hoping to get her drunk and flirt and get her to forget about the rest of the world for the evening. Start as social and see how far he can take it. I don't believe she has any intention do do anything. But if she is naive and inexperienced enough to not see the red flags, you should just tell her not to go."
784,"This is exactly spot on. I have tried to no success to show him that those 3 people are absolutely horrendous human beings. I have brought him around my friends, my friends don't do this. Thank you for responding."
785,"Think about it this way: right now you're focussing on the ""small things in life"" because your day to day life is unpleasant and stressful. But if you could find a way to live away from your parents negativity, that stress would not be there and that in itself is something to enjoy. 

My first couple years on my own I had to be very very frugal, but I knew I was working toward a better future for myself, so it was bearable. "
786,"You forgot to change his ex's name at one point here, might want to fix that."
787,"To me, the takeaway from this is that she said it’s not even worth upsetting you. Learning to reprioritize in a relationship is a really important thing that took me far too long to learn. I didn’t understand why going to a concert with my friend, his wife, and her sister, upset my girlfriend. I was stupid. Well, ex girlfriend now, for obvious reasons she dumped my stupid butt.  Point being, you have a girl that considers your feelings in her decision making and already knows to weigh the priorities and can recognize that you’re more important to her than a mildly fun night, and that you can’t always have both. That’s pretty impressive and I would value that very highly in her, and make sure you appreciate that.:)"
788,"Erotica is awesome and there’s no shame in writing it. It’s also the one field of fiction writing that a decent writer with good marketing skills and determination can readily turn into a career —- but it still takes tremendous effort. It’s amazing that she’s succeeded at that, good on her!

That said, omg OP, get out. You were way too young to get involved with this person— that age gap!! She will never value your needs and interests in a relationship, and you have no respect for her passion. You two are a terrible match, and it’s time for you to move on and find someone sexually and socially and romantically compatible. She will only continue to prioritize herself and her fandom over you, as well as her delusions that she might actually get somewhere IRL with her celebrity crush. Don’t stick around. You know what’s worse than ten years of your life drained by this relationship? Eleven, twelve, or more... "
789,"Accept that you’ll be staying home. 

“Mom, I know how important this trip is to you. I want you to know that I want to be there. You and I are aware of brother’s condition” (call it a condition, not issues. He may not be diagnosed but it sounds intense enough to just refer to it as a medical or psychological problem. Don’t call it an issue). “I understand he has every right to go. If he does attend this trip my husband and I will need to miss it. Im asking you to understand that his behavior is poor enough that the trip will have only bad memories if I attend with him. That isn’t fair to you. Maybe we can work something else out. But I cannot attend the trip with brother due to his condition and his treatment of others.” 

She is going to rally at you hard because she can; you’ve got typical emotional responses and she isn’t afraid of you so you’ll be the one she can express herself to. And if she gets out of hand id get direct. “Have you considered the issue is not my choice to avoid brother’s actions, but his own refusal to consider others and get the help he needs?” And then back off and let her calm down. "
790,"Oh I do, every day she gets home I giver her a hug and tell her how I missed her. I hold her when she is sad or upset, etc.

I do give massages sometimes as well, I make sure that I try not to deprive her of what she needs, I just wish that I enjoyed those things as well."
791,"I think you’re getting some honest feedback from a lot of other commenters, so I’ll just give you some advice for the three months long distance you’ll be doing:

1. He should be in therapy, ASAP. Before the long distance begins.

2. Set a specific time to call each other (daily, every other day, whatever works for you both). Set this time before you go and stick to it. If it needs to be moved for any reason, give each other a heads up ahead of time). 

3. Take pics together before you or he leaves. Write each other a cute note. Look at the notes and pics when you miss each other/he becomes insecure. 

4. Set boundaries ahead of time for communication (part of step 2). Otherwise, it’ll be easy to fight over missed calls/texts/etc. these boundaries will help to serve as proof that nothing shady is going on. So if you miss a call from him, he can remind himself that your call time is 9pm (for example), and that you’ve already discussed your schedule, so it makes sense that you’re not answering. 

Good luck. "
792,This has often been a problem with me and my gf cause she has had a lot of serious relationships before me and I have only had one pre dating our relationship. She’s  older than me and has already gone through her party phase and has a lot of good memories with her ex’s. This does not upset me it’s just that I do feel alienated when she talks about those experiences with her friends that’s she has known for quiet some time. Often times it can make me uncomfortable when she mentions explicit sexual things she has done with her exs and it often makes me shut down to avoid being an asshole. It’s hard cause you know they deserve to have those memories but it sucks on the other end cause you want to be a good part in their lives and have memories with them. Just know you’re not alone. Best advice would just be to speak with him and have him try to help make you more part of the conversations cause you can’t change the past and odds are their are gonna be more uncomfortable situations like that but if he can try on his side to make you feel more included that would significantly help your relationship and also your state of mind
793,"Dude, you don't even know her, you have barely even spoken to her. You can't love someone you don't know. This is just infatuation/lust, and it's completely inappropriate. If you approach her she's likely to file a complaint against you and you'll lose your uber gig. Not to mention be completely freaked out, because it's 100% creepy to act on what you are feeling."
794,I had to bury my comment because I didn't want to be attacked by the PMS deniers.
795,"Totally agree, parents like this enables spoiled brats that they raise that never had to over come anything with blood, sweat, and tears."
796,"I did at one time, however I am still in college (obviously, behind in life). Money is a little tight so I don't exactly have the best affordability with it. I have some anxiety issues as well (over-worrying, etc). 

It is on my agenda, but below obvious needs like food, water, gas etc. I am sure there will come a time when I am able to throw down cash for this. I do think it will benefit me, when the time comes."
797,[removed]
798,The only way to find out is to try it. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. 
799,"We try our best in this context, generally besides me getting her going sometimes we do participate in mutual masturbation. 

Sexting for some reason seems weird to me now, but didn't seem weird to me when I was younger. I guess, i'm so familiar with her sexually and as a person that it doesn't feel as ""mysterious"", etc."
800,Refusal to seek help when you’re aware of your impact on others is on brother. He knows. He doesn’t care. 
801,"No. Don't cherry pick the one overly-ethical person here. You had no intention to do harm.

This is not a ""shitty thing."" It's a technicality. I guess to some extent it matters how close you are with your boyfriend. I would forge my wife's signature in a heartbeat if I had to - not to do anything bad to her (I wouldn't!) but because a lot of the time it's just a technicality. I'n not a thief. One time, I signed a form to get a replacement ownership for her car because she was out of town and an hours' drive away. She just laughed when I told her. Was it illegal? Sure. Did it harm her in any way? No. If I was the sort of person that would do harm, she wouldn't be with me in the first place.

The person you're replying to/agreeing with is like a priest who forsakes anyone who brakes rules without considering the IMPACT of those rules being broken. In this case, no harm, no foul. 

Move on. Honestly. If your BF is past it, just let it go."
802,"When you don't have a boyfriend you're single, but when you don't have friends you're alone. The only situation where I would ditch a friend for a SO is if my friend did something bad. Never just because my SO wants to. I probably would never ditch a friend for someone I've dated for a month"
803,"You can always choose to leave the relationship if this is too much for you. There's nothing you can do here at this point other than be patient with him. He's getting help for his issues. 

OP, you deserve happiness and love as well and if this guy isn't meeting your needs, you have every right to leave him. He's a 39 year old adult and you're not responsible for him if you leave him. Stop setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm if you can't handle this relationship anymore. "
804,Gives more opportunity to the rest of us though. 
805,"I am aware (on the last bit). On one hand, I do feel the need to maintain a relationship with my father (who was the one that treated me much better). I would feel guilty if something happened to them and I was the one keeping far away. On the other, it is difficult with my past.

I am aware of the therapy thing, and it's on the agenda but being in college and all money is tight. We are also saving up for a house, all that good stuff too."
806,You should be delighted you have grounds to obtain full custody of your child now.  I would get away from her as fast as humanly possible. 
807,"This crossed my mind too. The only way to ensure not being subjected to the brother is to not attend at all. If I was OP, I’d be on edge that he’d show up the entire time I was there."
808,"Breaks don't work. You guys can be successful co-parents together without being romantic partners. She sounds checked out and honestly, this sounds like one of those ""if you love them, set them free"" situations. "
809,"If you haven't already, try to pick places that are new to the whole group.  New places - new memories.  If  you can entertain, you can invite his friends to a pot luck/game night at your place - good will gesture and again making new memories.  

The friend who was friends with your boyfriend &amp; boyfriend's ex has his own demons to conquer.  Not your problem; but, maybe he's afraid to loss this friend too.  When he starts monopolizing the  conversation by overwriting the present with the past, your boyfriend (not you) should deflect and bring you into the conversation.   

You can make it clear to your boyfriend that you're not asking him to pick them over you, you're asking for the common courtesy of being included.

You can also try to make new friends as a couple and incorporate them into the current group."
810,"I don't think most jobs would call the cops after a single missed day, unless they knew she had an on-going on serious medical condition, though."
811,"&gt; I was just saying guys in their 20s suck

Not all of them. I would argue that a 50-something year old falling for a 20 year old probably has more issues than a guy in his 20s. Especially a 50 year old who apparently has stalkerish tendencies 0_0"
812,"Break it down to a series of steps. In my opinion, the first step would be to ask the doctor if they think fetal alcohol syndrome might be the reason for the child's current state. It would be worth quietly investigating that. Then break it down from there: find a divorce lawyer, get paternity results back, figure out a living situation, plan the move, etc. All quietly so she can't manipulate you or throw a big wrench into the works"
813,"Sometimes people don’t realize how negative they are. If you call attention to it every time...she’ll start to notice.  And hopefully be embarrassed by it, and make an effort to change it.

If not, at least you have taken a stand for yourself, and let her know you don’t want to be treated this way. 
"
814,"Please refrain from insulting.
"
815,She is 30 years younger than you. There is a huge power imbalance here. You have nothing in common with her. You're infatuated with her because she's young looking and are considering stalking her. Keep the fuck away.
816,"So, she’s in the wrong. I think your misstep was in specifying diaper duty as a reason for discomfort. It’s enough to say “I don’t have experience with very young children and the first time I’m responsible for one, I’ll want some additional support til I can do it 1:1.” When you specify that you’ve never changed a diaper as the reason for discomfort it’s too easy for her to say “WOW what’ll it be like when you have a kid”. 

But let’s be clear; her expectation and favor wasn’t appropriate. When you expressed discomfort she should have accepted it. She didn’t. And backed you into a corner. 

I’d be pissed if it turned out my 1 year old was being babysat by the partner of my friend that she’d never met. It sounds like this friend doesn’t have her childcare sorted out and that pressure is 2nd hand to your gf. But it’s simply not her job. “Something came up and I can’t” not “let me pressure and guilt my partner into it even though they don’t have experience with babies.” 

OP I have a 3 year old and still don’t feel comfortable with other people’s babies unless they are very young or toddler aged and up. 1 is a weird age! You’re fine. Your gf owes you an apology. 

But you know a difficult conversation re: your own family planning is also in your near future. Don’t shy away from it. "
817,[removed]
818,"This is not unreasonable on your part and the situation is *very* different than being a father (even in the near vs far future).

As a father myself, having kids is a whole different ballgame to babysitting. First of all, with your own kids, you have 9 months of notice (usually) to prepare and read up and learn and then, when the kid arrives, it's *your damn kid*.

Her analogy would be the same as if you said you wanted to train for a marathon in a few years but you've never run before and she said ""Okay, run a half marathon in 2 weeks"". One thing does not inform the problems/difficulties of the other.

Hold your ground and refuse to do this and if you know the baby's mother enough to reach out, I'd suggest letting her know that she'll need to find another sitter. Just reach out directly and say something like ""Hey, GF asked if I could babysit on X date and I'm not available. Just wanted to give you notice so you had plenty of time to find someone else... Thanks!"" 

Doing it that way shows that you sort of assume your GF told her about the change in plans and if not, well, she'll ask your GF about it, but she'll certainly know your GF is unavailable as well and find someone else."
819,wait what?he has every right to be mad about his girlfriend forging his signature.
820,"&gt; I know he is the owner, but this boss takes at least two 2 week vacations a year and on both occasions never told me until a few days before he was leaving. 

This is not a good argument so don't even bring it up. Just tell Boss A what is going on and tell him you can't back out. Hopefully he will run interference on Boss B. "
821,"Thank you for your reply, I’ve asked Jon about her briefly but I also don’t want him to think that I am being crazy, so I wanted to see if other people might agree with me before I talked to him. I would like to portray myself a certain way. Would you still think that they are not into one another if I included: (response to another commenter)

At the surprise party they threw for Ellie over the summer, she and Jon talked in private for a long time. Jon is usually really careful about including me in everything and making sure I’m comfortable, and he didn’t even look my way once during their whole encounter. It just looked really intense, and I was awkwardly by myself the whole time watching them which made me feel so uncomfortable. Also we were at someone’s pool, so he was shirtless and she was in a really skimpy bikini the whole time they were talking. I guess I just feel like intense private conversations are not normal for exes? Unless they have feelings for one another?

Also I forgot to mention this but Ellie and her fiancé just broke up last month so I wonder if that’s part of the reason why she is reaching out to Jon now. I definitely don’t want to seem controlling or possessive, I want them to like me! But I just don’t trust her around Jon. "
822,"Lol there's no misunderstanding. This dude isn't secure in himself and wants you to warp reality to placate him. Like many, many men.

Props to you for engaging and educating. But don't let him convince you what you said was wrong or out of line. "
823,"Of course you want her to get help. She was the love of your life and the mother of your child. But, she's not the same person that feel in love with you.

Lawyer up and protect your son. That has to be your priority right now."
824,[removed]
825,"He didn’t give specifics and personally it sounds like a pretty tactful way to address it. You say yourself you’re defaulting to leggings and large shirts because you don’t go anywhere. What if you’re in a loop? You don’t look prepared to go out so it never happens and next weekend you just pack more sweats. He may be making assumptions based on your clothes. Or you can plan day trips or evenings out. 

It would be concerning if he was specifying stuff like types of makeup or clothes but what I hear is simply “more effort”. I mean he doesn’t wear makeup...A tinted lipgloss, maybe mascara on you is probably a massive difference to him. 

Now if this isn’t your personality, ok! But: you used to make an effort. You may not have the same funds or time but I’m sure you have pieces that are for going out, or jeans to wear with a sort instead of leggings, etc. 

Decide what small changes sit right with you and gauge his reaction. Maybe he was actually very pointed but the way you explain it doesn’t sound tactless or like he’s asking for a Barbie doll partner. "
826,"Talk to him and stop acting like a child. You seem to desire the attention that acting like a brat usually brings you. A mature, emotionally healthy person like him isn't going to put up with your nonsense forever. Learn to express yourself verbally or get ready to be single very soon."
827,"A lot of different issues can be caused by alcohol. It would sick if she did this to your kid.

Either way you need to leave before she ""accidentally"" gets pregnant again."
828,Surely she's not hiding anything and projecting on to OP!!
829,She is closer to a child than you are to her age so that’s still gross 🤷‍♀️
830,"Good, don't.

It doesn't for several reasons. Many of which are in every other part of my post. Your boyfriend's jealousy is unhealthy and delusional, as are the reasons he gives for having them. 

The second is because I honestly do not believe that no other aspect of your life or your relationship is impacted.

What does he get upset about?"
831,"OP, you NEED a lawyer. Save the money and do it. Ask for help if necessary. The only way you can totally protect your son is by making sure she can't have access to him. Otherwise, she can fight for custody herself. "

834,"&gt;Why exactly did you block her tho, seems like such a childish move

I think he was justified here

&gt; she was just sending me videos of her singing and dancing, I felt like I was talking to a wall and told her that I was done

She's naive, immature, foolish and annoying. Sounds like he tried to get through to her, but she's in a fog. He's right to block her and try to ignore/move on. 

Pretty standard for many people after a breakup. Nothing childish about blocking someone you're no longer with, who makes bad decisions and won't listen to reason. It's not his obligation to keep in contact with anyone for any reason, especially someone who thinks they're suddenly the mother of someone else's 3yr old baby, after meeting them online 2 days earlier. Maintaining a relationship with her would be emotionally draining."
835,"I hope everyone is aware that I am aware I don't speak in absolutes. This is just like, my opinion, man"
836,"If the information is accurate (seriously, just check his driver license), that is a deal breaker. He didn't just fudge by a year or two, which already wouldn't be great, but by 10 years! How are you supposed to trust anything else he tells you if he lies that much about his age?   


Date someone closer in age to you. "
837,"This is a problem for her parents, not you. There isn't anything you can do to change it.

Live your own life."
838,"Ok, so what’s your solution? They should be upset about it and let it eat through the relationship forever? "
839,"&gt;But what do I tell her, I have called her and talked to her on monday because we were on a mall, she said that she was going to break up with him, on tuesday she tells me she is tired asf because she was talking to him until 4am and that she couldn't break up with him and everytime I talk to her she tells me to give him a chance, I really wanna do something, but idk what to do.

 Just when you thought she was starting to get it, she tells you the very next day she can't break-up, etc. She doesn't want your help, so don't waste you time. Leave her blocked and move on."

841,"No keep her blocked. She definitely does not care about the effort you are putting in. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and 10 years from now you will be in a much different place in your life where you can look back on fhis stuff and almost laugh at how much you cared. I’m not saying your caring is a laughing matter, I’m just saying that the emotions and drama we have at 16 don’t compare to what ends up mattering to you at 26 and beyond. You’ll be okay, just cut her out before she drags you down with her. Finish high school, go to college, create a life for yourself. "
842,"This woman doesn’t sound stable or healthy enough to be in any kind of relationship, let alone a marriage. It is NOT normal for any person in their late 20s to not only pursue a barely-legal teenager, but convince that teen to move in with them. This is predatory behavior. Can you imagine having a lot in common with an 18 year old girl at your age right now? Would you want to move in with someone who was a high school student within the past year? I doubt you would. She took advantage of you then, and from the sounds of it she is continuing to take advantage of you now. 

She has made it perfectly clear that you are not and never will be a priority to her. Making your spouse a priority in your life is literally all that marriage is. It’s a promise to remain faithful to another person and value them and their needs as much as you value yourself and your own needs. She has never truly been a partner or wife to you. 

You should absolutely end this. Don’t try to talk it out with her, or confront her, or threaten to leave and not follow through. Go talk to a lawyer, begin divorce proceedings, and look for a new place to live for either you or her. This should be over. "
843,"Yes, follow up.  Maybe it slipped his mind.  Never hurts to ask to hang out again."
844,Its so rough and I will do what I can. She worked and I stayed at home to take care of the kids. Since she had the better degree and made more money. Child care costs is no joke. I really wish I would have seen this coming so things would have been different. This all happened so fast.
845,"I prefer to believe that people are honest, you can tell or guess when someone lies but I didnt get that from her when she said she doesnt have fb. Why everyone assumes that she lies? not everyone has fb, let's get real"
846,"Well shes always nice to me, im reading this like a signal to keep pushing"
847,"Sorry if it's a late reply, but your words were really kind and I couldn't ignore them. Thanks a lot, I really needed to hear some kind and loving words. It was as you said, I was in panic but not pregnant, as it was really early on my periods. Thank you so, so much. Sending love to you ❤️"
848,"OP you remind me of myself. I didn't exactly have the best childhood either and my parents fought a lot. I was *extremely* adverse to touching and hugging with everyone. I had that same feeling of feeling trapped and uncomfortable. I wanted to crawl out of my skin like a snake and get the hell away!

I really, *really* suggest therapy. It will take a lot of time and effort, but I swear it will be worth it. I went once a week to cognitive behavioral therapy (talk therapy basically) for about a year and then was gradually able to scale it back to once every other week, then once a month, etc. I was very lucky and clicked with my first therapist. Lots of people don't and that's okay. You may have to try several different therapists. It will be frustrating and discouraging but don't give up!

My therapy sessions have made me feel so much more at peace. I can even happily initiate hugs with my close friends and partners now! Just remember that you're not broken or a bad person and you should not feel ashamed or guilty. You didn't deserve to be abused by your parents. What you deserve is to have a happy and healthy life with lots of love and support from your friends and girlfriend."
849,"Who knows, who cares? The bottom line is she doesn't want you in her life and you need to respect that."
850,"Seriously. I would never think to forge my SO's signature, but if I somehow needed it and she wasn't around, I'd at least text or call her to explain what's going on and why I'd like her permission.



No way in hell would I ever use her signature for something she didn't have knowledge of and/or didn't approve of"
851,"You are being way to hard on yourself. Yes, you may have done the wrong thing and there is the question of legality but it was for something you know well never be needed because you aren't going to steal from your boyfriend. You made a mistake, owned up to it to your bf, apologized and offered remedies to the situation. He forgave you, forgive yourself. 
If you feel this bad a year later that you forged his signature then you are not the type of person who steals money online."
852,"Am I missing where it’s confirmed that he demanded, made fun of her efforts, or expected her to make an effort that he does not? A lot of details are buried in comments but I didn’t see anything like that. I don’t like his use of the word power couple either but I can respect that he attempted to be tactful and asked directly without being unkind. It’s never going to be a conversation that feels good. "
853,"Just because she was into you a year ago doesn't mean she's into you now.  If she wouldn't want you to confess feelings, it's because she doesn't reciprocate them.  I really don't think she's interested."
854,"He's not sending you mixed signals, you're creating the mixed signals in your head to fill in the gaps from his total lack of signals. Ask him and follow up. "
855,Thank you.
856,"It's been a year - I would talk to him. You guys are a team, he decided to stay together. Check in with him about how he feels regarding it. Let him know you regret it every day. I would also assure him you'd be willing to a sign a pre-nup (if you would be) if you guys get to that point. He might be able to help you let go of some of the guilt you feel. If he doesn't fully trust you a year later, then you both either can't move past this or need to put in more work/communication to do so."
857,"Depends on how many people you've dated.

Not best friends, but if as you get older &amp; have more relationships and it seems that every single one of your past relationship ends in a burnt bridge/nuclear winter? Yeah, that's a bit of a red flag. It's to be expected that at least a few of your exes should make the cut into being friends, at least IMO, or at least cordial acquaintances. 

Being able to be friendly after dating someone is good when you're a mature adult. Nobody expects it from younger people because generally the end of a relationship (when you're young) is a trainwreck. Managing the crash so it's less of a wreck is important. "
858,"&gt; I was playing true or dare with bunch of office friends

Did I miss the memo on this one? "
859,"That's how my hubby and I are with working out.  We've tried working out together, and it just doesn't work.  We tried a few compromises, and it still didn't work.  So we just stopped doing it together.  Might be a solution for some of the situations that OP and his wife don't need to do together, like cooking.  "
860,"Nowhere in her post does it state that she pressed herself against the door to listen. If I’m sitting in my living room and someone is at the door of the apartment across from mine, I can easily hear their conversation. And that’s with an outside corridor. Sounds like hers in indoor, seeing as how she had to buzz the police in, which would only make overhearing conversation in a doorway/ hallway that much easier. "
861,"It's not disturbing, it's pretty typical.

Society has conditioned everyone, but especially women, that it's the natural order of things for everyone to want to have children.  It's not.

And many people tell their partners they might want kids someday, knowing full well that they never will because A. They love their partner and are hoping they will change their mind, B. They think they can ""fake it till they make it"" and have a child to make their partner happy.

And sometimes people are really Fencesitters and don't truly know if they want kids, despite thinking they are annoying at times, gross, draining, etc.

Because children are all of those things.  But there's an asinine stigma that won't let anyone, especially not parents, admit and accept that fact.  You can like children, want your own, love your own, and still rightfully acknowledge that a lot of what's involved in raising them is disgusting, monotonous, frustrating, etc.  There's also a lot that is heartwarming, hilarious, unexpectedly fantastic, etc."
862,"Your obsession is not healthy for you or for her. Please seek counseling. I’m sorry you are in this situation, but you need to understand that the way you feel is not healthy and you need to work on managing those emotions. "
863,"Because it's not what really happened that matters, it's how she FEELS about what happened.

His feeling are irrelevant, apparently."
864,Have some self-respect and break up with this bitch
865,Age gape isn't in itself an issue. My friends parents have a 15 year difference and have been happy married 20 odd years. I think it's am issue with the wife in this situation.
866,Yeah for real. I told her that and that’s why she deleted it. 
867,"“Of course I don’t see you as weak. People get injured and quite honestly the strongest thing to do is to get seen. This is about your health, not your reputation. I am your wife. You are always strong to me. I need you to see a doctor.” "
868,"If you are looking at problems and trying to assign blame, your marriage is not going to last. Follow the overwhelming advice here and go to couples counseling. You have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing so. At a minimum, obviously your communication is shit otherwise you wouldn't be here. "
869,"Let’s be realistic: does he want a Barbie or a little more feminine and put together look? Pretty sure he is asking for the later. Who says you need endless hours of grooming to look good? No one. There are 5 minute tutorials on basic natural make up. Run the straightener through your hair a few times is plenty for some people. How about cute sweaters and more feminine clothing?

I am lazy AF and my job does not allow a lot of flair nor do I give a rats ass to spend a crazy amount of money to look a certain way. I keep a clean feminine look with simple and versatile jewelry and natural make up which is usually eyebrows and mascara.

A little effort goes a long way."
870,"If your friends made comments about you two being soul-mates or whatever I can see how that made him really insecure about how no one will get you like how Ben does. I would not mention to Chris how Ben said he was cold towards him. That will make things much worse and seem like Ben is trying to sabotage the relationship. Ben should understand your new boyfriends might take some time to warm up to him.


You're definitely owed an apology. You need to have a good talk to make this work. He needs to tell you what made him go from okay with it to not anymore. You need to take an outside look at the relationship with Ben and see if there are some things that might have upset him. The relationship can work as long as hes willing to work with you, but if he doesn't and insists on him or Ben its time to end it.  "
871,"If that's the case, then you sound like you could benefit from some therapy to work through your issues from your previous relationship and not have to burden Jon with them unfairly. "
872,"Sign…. Mistakes that I made , I was weird and shit back then , bunch of shit happened continuously back then"
873,I've read nothing good about this scenario. I think you know what to do.

877,"dude you're not a psychiatrist. stop with that ""disordered thinking"" shit "
878,She lonely and or desperate. If you don't want to talk to her block her and forget about it. 
879,"If you didn’t tell her to delete the pic of the kids dick (it feels very wrong typing that out) would she have on her own ? Because that’s considered child porn. 

So if the wrong person discovered that she’d be in jail. That might be me sounding hyperbolic but that shit is crazy bananas illegal.

It’d be one thing if the kid asked her “hey I like this one girl in school but I don’t know what to say” and your gf said something like “hey man, it’s all about confidence. Tell her she looks nice or ask her if she wants to hang after school”. Totally fine, very appropriate.

But to have it get here ? Nah, dawg.

She needs to set up boundaries otherwise (also possibly hyperbolic) the kid might just start sending dick pics to random female classmates.

If your gf can word it correctly have her talk to the kids parents that this isn’t ok and reinforce these good behaviors instead of punishing him for wrong behaviors."
880,"I haven’t read all the comments, but I think making her something and going over to check on her would be a great idea. "
881,"I agree. Planning on becoming a father means you've got all the time trying to conceive and through the duration of the pregnancy to learn about babies and how to care for them, plus you're not usually left alone with the baby immediately. You've got people around you watch and learn from and to ask questions. Being left to babysit someone else's kid with no support on short notice is a completely different situation than preparing to raise your own child."
882,[removed]
883,Do both of yourselves a favor and break up. This woman is a 23 year old adult and she'll be able to figure her own shit out after you end the relationship. 
884,"Here's the thing about boundaries: they are YOUR boundaries that you decide you're comfortable with. Your partner has every right to not agree with your boundaries and not follow them and if that's the case, it means that you two are just incompatible. But, you trying to control who he and his friends hang out with is an unreasonable boundary on your part. "
885,"Agreed. I don’t want the police at my damn door if I’ve got diarrhea, the flu, or whatever. "
886,"Maybe if it comes up with your bro, be casual like “bro im not gay, not really even  “bi”, I’m just just freak in the bedroom” he might get uncomfortable and drop it, no one wants to talk to their family about their brothers “freaky sex life”, just a suggestion. 

Good luck! "
887,"My sister once commented on the fact that I didn't vacuum in the direction that would make a pattern with the lines.  So, then I vacuumed in a circular direction attempting a spiral.  She just left in a huff and suggested to our parents that we no longer be paired to complete chores together.

&amp;#x200B;"
888,"I mean, you two just sound incompatible. Does it sound like she's getting feelings for you? Yeah, but if you know that you can't meet her needs when it comes to life/relationship goals, then you shouldn't try being in a relationship with her. Like, she deserves a chance to find someone that wants to marry her and if you're not that person, you two are just incompatible as romantic partners."
889,"&gt; wanted me to have counselling to find out if anything was behind my feelings.

Seems she wanted you to go to counseling to see if there was anything else behind your feelings. "
890,"Maybe you two have different ways of showing your love. One idea that gets mentioned on this sub from time to time is the ""five love languages"", you could look that up. And think about what the ways are that she seems to prefer showing her love in. 

"
891,Can you update your post with specific examples of how this man is actually shaming you and disrespecting your choices directly? It changes the advice quite a bit. You’ve positioned him as asking tactfully but comments show that he makes racist comments and minimizes your experience with sexual harassment which makes all of this unacceptable.

893,"I've already pretty much cut any way for them to steal from me again. The only thing I share with them now is that I'm on their cell phone plan, and I've been wanting to split to be on my own for a while now but my provider requires the account owner's permission (my dad's) to do that kind of thing for some reason. I doubt they would be petty enough to steal a physical non-money gift. Plus I'm not really a big ""gift"" person since there aren't many things I want, just financial stability, so I doubt that would be an issue anyway. "
894,"&gt;saying other men got to experience what he never has had from me

WHAT.

Honey, I'm sorry to say this, but I think it would be best to break up with this dude. He's not the worst guy I've seen on this sub, but he's, uhh... got a lot of growing up to do. He has *no entitlement* to 'experience you' the way previous guys have 'experienced you', ugh I feel gross just typing that out. It doesn't matter what you've done in the past (whether that's dress up more, wilder sex, or idk what else, cook and clean for your man), he has to be happy with what you're offering *now*. People change; you've changed. You don't want to be the person you used to be, and he seems to be more interested in dating you for who you *could/used to* be, than who you *are*.

This breakup doesn't have to be acrimonious and accusatory; just tell him that it seems like he's looking for someone who *isn't you*, and that you are breaking up with him so that you can both find more compatible partners. It's not wrong of him to want a girl who likes wearing sexier clothes in public, but it's wrong of him to try to mold you into that shape."

898,That’s already happened a couple times haha
899,"1.	My mom was supposed to sign two sides of a permission slip when I was in school and only signed one. 
2.	Someone gives me a credit card to buy something for them and I sign for them.
3.	Someone who lives with me needs to sign for a delivery and isn’t around.

etc etc "
900,He hasn’t taken any initiative to spend time with children OR learn how to take care of children.
901,"I mean, you can set boundaries with your mom and I think therapy would help teach you how to deal with your living situation better until you move out. 

Here's how to set boundaries with your mom: learn to walk away. She starts prying? Walk away. Stop spending so much time in the house. Go to the library or a coffee shop. Find ways to get distance from your mom even though you live with her. "
902,"As a youngish-man with chronic pain/low back pain, there is a factor that your husband is not entirely incorrect about.

Someone in his/our demographic showing up to an urgent care clinic or an ER is just going to immediately get labeled as ""drug-seeking"" or ""waste of time"" - the job for an urgent care or ER doc is to churn through as many patients as possible and make sure the acutely ill people aren't at immediate risk of dropping dead. A young man with back pain is just going to get a cursory, 2 minute examination and a prescription for high-dose ibuprofen or meloxicam/some anti-inflammatory and kicked out the door.

Your husband likely needs an orthopaedic doctor, or even more likely an orthopaedic neurologist - coupled with a regular physical therapist. Even with the best specialists and care, there is often not much you can do outside of treating the pain symptomatically, and doing strengthening/stretching exercises to make sure things don't get worse. The recommendation for a psychologist/therapist to come up with coping strategies for a life of chronic pain is probably advisable, too.

I mention all of this to maybe give some perspective on *why* your husband is so reluctant to ""just go see a doctor."" He's probably been eye-rolled at, accused of manipulating the system for oxycontin/Percocets, told to ""quit whining,"" etc, by more doctors than you can shake a stick at. Best case scenario, even if he's taken seriously, there's not much the medical industry is going to do outside of giving high-dose NSAIDS, shrugging, and referring to a bigger and better specialist.

While that doesn't make *your* experience any better - as watching your loved one writhe on the floor must be a *lovely* experience - again, I just want to give some perspective and a sense of realism for why people like us are so reluctant, sometimes."
903,"You’re not a prop. If he didn’t like how you dress, he shouldn’t have started dating you. It’s one thing to ask someone to dress up for an event that has a certain social dress code, but “dress up for me when we hang out” is pretty ridiculous, and (per your later comments to the thread), “dress provocatively in public because I want people to look at you like my prize” is a whole field of no."
904,"Universities sometimes offer therapy to students for free, you should look into it."
905,"I understand the sentiment, but it’s wayyy to harsh. She isn’t doing shitty things for personal gain, she signed a document for work, dude. She isn’t scheming on how best to screw people for her gain. What she did isn’t even “shitty” maybe sucky, but come on, that’s way too much of an overstatement "
906,It’s extremely common for someone to use social media to flirt with someone when all they know about that person is what they look like and if they seem vaguely funny. I’m sure you’re thinking  about it way harder than this girl is.
907,"I think it's more rude to lead someone on, when you aren't really interested in having any kind of friendship/relationship with them. "

910,That's kinda my point
911,I mean he is the type of guy who has a continuous intense back pain because of ****multiple**** motorcycle accidents.
912,"this woman: slept with her ex the first night you met, was probably cheating on you in the beginning (or still is), called the cops on you, BIT YOU, and calls the mother of your kids a fucking slut. dude, you're 47 years old. how is this even a question? how do you not know better than this?"
913,"Curious about what?  You gave her your boundaries, she followed those boundaries.  Maybe she thought she could do FWB and realized it didn't work for her.  It wouldn't work for me and that doesn't require feelings for the other person."
914,"I value the relationship. I want it to work. I don't find her spare tyre attractive. Are you suggesting that to spare her feelings I just end the relationship without giving her the opportunity to fix this problem, Of course she can call me a first class git and dump me.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I tell my GF that I don't like her spare tyre without being rude because I'm all ears here - my experience is that commenting negatively on any aspect of a womans' physique is never acceptable however well it's couched."
915,She literally reported to you that she doesn't like the way this arrangement makes her feel. It's not that she developed feelings. She doesn't like the way she was being treated. Having sex with someone brings up feelings and sometimes aftercare is required. That doesn't mean she fell in love with you it means FWB doesn't work for her.

919,"Well here's my little story. Me (27f) and my bf (32) were talking about the actress Zendaya and he proceeds to tell me how awful she looked in a Spiderman movie. I proceeded to look up that role of hers and a bit slack jawed I replied ""that's exactly how i have looked for the past three weeks!"" ( finals) and he enthusiastically answers 'I know!' Idk what the moral of the story is. I have a broad sense of humor so I didn't get butt hurt, but I also don't really ever feel put down for being a bum. He would just as well have me naked all the time. And if your not attracted to her, that's pretty fucked up. Of you. You suck. Blahblahblah personal standards, you still suck."
920,"This waaaaaaay too complicated to make any sense out of; move on son, there are better matches out there."

924,"Well clearly it's flying over your head, especially since you're one of the proponents advocating for her to forget and move on. The people I tend to associate with at least don't deliberately involve their SO's when committing felonies, and if you think that's just a ""simple mistake"" anyone would do rather than a character flaw that merits serious self-awareness and addressing in order to be dealt with, then we live in different realities"
925,"whooaaaaaaaaaaa. This is... entitled. And kind of gross.

932,"&gt;I'm not even asking that much of her

Yes you are. You're asking her to change herself in order to meet your standards. You're entitled to your feelings, but this is a stupid thing to be upset about. "
933,"Do you feel depressed?  You sound depressed to me.  It's not always about being super sad.  I'd make an appointment with a therapist to see what they think.  Even if it's not depression, talking to someone about these issues could be beneficial.  Best of luck."
934,"My wife has forged mine when cashing birthday checks or using the shared credit card with my name on it.

Lots of relationship boundaries are strong for some and fuzzy for others, this is one of them."
935,I wasn't trying to be hurtful but she had to know there was a problem and what the problem was in order for her to decide whether SHE wanted to fix this problem or dump me. I couched it in the nicest possible language. She was hurt but that was never my intention.
936,"I don't think you understand, the issue is not that Ben is your ""ex""-- as you said, you really weren't romantically involved for long --it's that you have maintained a deeply intimate relationship with him for so long.  Your friends are used to it but new guys may not not find it as easy to handle it as they thought.

&gt; The guy wasn't really the jealous type and said “He can live with it” ...weren't into each other enough to work on the relationship.

And you really don't know whether some of that may have been that he didn't think it was worth it to work on a relationship with someone who was so clearly bonded with another man. "
937,"It may also ruin her sister's relationship with one or both parents.

I'm 100% for keeping affair details away from children until they are adults and it is relevant. 

OP, why does she need to know? To spread the misery? If you need to talk to someone that's ok, ask your dad to pay for a counselor."

Buddy, that was ridiculous to read through. Just red flag after red flag.  If this was a soccer game, the only people left on the field would be a ball boy and linesman just waving that shit in your face.

Is this the first pussy you're getting since the divorce? Is this better behavior than your Ex wife? Jesus christ, why are you putting up with this?  Trust and believe there are ***far*** more mentally stable and just as attractive women out there. I hope she was at least hot &amp; good in bed, but that still ain't worth this bullshit. 

Sorry to be harsh, but *man* she is soooooo obviously projecting because she ***regularly*** fucks her exes like the first time you met her, and the time she gave the dude a place to stay and blow jobs galore in exchange for a new kitchen, and thinks you're fucking 3 year old."
942,"There is a line between, being a massive slob at home and dressing up like you would on a date.

She shouldn't have to dress up as heavily as she does for work, dates, or going to the gym when she's at home that is unreasonable and you don't seem to be making obnoxious requests.

You said you don't care about bra, makeup or hair which is a large part of the dressing up portion, You're not asking her to be 100% you're just asking her to not be 0%"

944,"If he most likely lied about his age, it means that he most likely doesn't want you to know his real age. It's interesting scenario, beacuse it's easily verifiable. He obvioously did it beause it makes him look better in your eyes, which is a problem, because you only do it when you think short-term, it's never done in a real relationship."
945,"Doubt is natural in any relationship. It happens and usually passes quickly when confronted. Yours feels a little more endemic and unresolved. It's probably time you talked to someone professional to help you deal with your past. Between now and then, write down when you feel anxious, time/date. What you feel triggered it and the first four random thoughts that pop in your head. 12-15 words max for the whole thing. Maybe there's a pattern you can fix with your professional.

950,"I don't know your brother, but if he's at all a decent dude I would say the fact that he just sent a picture and no actual words means he was really saying ""Yo you're broadcasting your porn, shut that shit down"". I think you can safely ignore it (other than making sure you're not accidentally broadcasting your porn anymore).

Most brothers do not want to think about their brother's sex life, much less discuss it. This is just a modern-day variation on walking in on your brother looking at a nude magazine or some such."
951,"I think you're missing the point.

She was checked on by police because she hadn't shown up to work in a couple days. That usually means a no-call, no-show. She just didn't show. If she had called in and told them she was sick they wouldn't just send police over. It sounds like maybe the woman was fibbing about being ill and could be going through something else - a depressive episode, anxiety, whatever and I think the OP being a bit concerned is warranted. She could just leave her number in case she needs anything, which is just kindness. No judgment or explanation needed."
952,"“Hi! This is your neighbor in 25b. I just wanted to drop a quick line to let you know that if you need anything, I’m right next door. My number is 555-5555. Please don’t hesitate to call or knock. Hope you’re feeling better!” 

Being a decent person isn’t a red flag to anyone else. She may not need the assistance, but hey, you offered. "
953,"Yeah, he doesn't care about you. Consider yourselves broken up and try to move on from him. "
954,I have an illness that I am constantly having to adjust meds for.  When I lived by myself it could be very scary because I was all alone.  I was always worried about what if I got really sick what would I do?  I think giving her your number would be so great.  I know I would’ve really appreciated that it would’ve given me a little more peace of mind.
955,"Hoping you saw the last thing I said? 

You are very kind. I have kind neighbors. We don't hang out, but we help each other. It's kinda perfect to me that way."
956,"There are some good excuses to use if it comes up and you don't want to get into it. 'Hahah got ya' is probably the easiest one to use.

In terms of talking about it, I think it only depends on the type of relationship you have with your brother. I think the way you describe it is that it's just a preference, and we can have a strong relationship with a person with without them knowing exactly what way we like to get touched or look at in the bedroom.

If it's an important thing about you that you want him to know then yeah go in and let him know that about you and open that discussion. 

But honestly it sounds to me like this might just be a TMI type of issue, like we know everyone poops but you don't have to describe what your average looking turd is shaped like, if that make sense. "
957,"&gt;She still wants to be best friends 

So that your heart can break every time she cries on your shoulder about her new boyfriend(s). 

The best way to get over a breakup is to block her on your phone and all social media. Out of sight = out of mind."
958,No he would insist on cleaning it by “burning-off” everything so he would heat up the pans while dirty and our house always smelled like a burning pig farm
959,"I don't get why you think is important to drag your 15-year old step sister into something that had nothing to do with her.  It almost seems as though you want her to feel the same pain you did at 14.

She'll eventually figure out how the dates line up (assuming that she hasn't already) and will ask *her parents* about in her own time.

Leave this alone."
960,Just do it. What are you waiting for? If you wait for the right moment it will pass you by.
961,"You fucked up by telling him to cancel with his friends. You wanted to see him I get that, but honestly they're his friends and he has a right to hang out with them. He left because you were manipulative."
962,"&gt; If you want kids in the near future, and you've never changed a baby, and you are currently using that as a reason not to babysit, will you be expecting her to do all of that?

I want to buy a car in the future, yet I don't have my license yet.  

It would be irresponsible (and illegal) for me to drive a car now, but at some point in the future, yep, I'll take the time to learn and jump through all the necessary hoops, and make sure I'm a good driver.

No, it's not a very good argument.  It is a very poor argument."
963,"This is just some stupid bullshit form. Your career is not based on a lie. It sounds like you're having intrusive, obsessive thoughts about this. Perhaps a therapist could teach you some CBT techniques to stop focusing on this. I also had obsessive thoughts like this before I started getting treatment for my anxiety."
964,I mean I side eye anyone who says 'I can't change a diaper' because it's wiping someone else's arse. It's basically no different to wiping your own and I wouldn't be too quick to advertise that you don't know much about that.
965,"Awesome, thanks for the support. I was almost about to forge someone's  signature but you kept me on the straight path."
966,How long have you been together? Did she look like this when you started dating?
967,Agreed.
968,Man the assumption on OP. This is hilarious
969,I think it’s totally reasonable for you to ask him to not break off from the group with her.  But I don’t think you can ask her not to talk to her at all.  But if he is getting too intensely into it or ignoring you I think you have a reason to talk with him.
970,"Well, yes it is.

""Whoever steals, takes, or abstracts, **or by fraud or deception obtains** any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned.""

The US Federal Statute on what constitutes mail theft disagrees with you, so stop splitting hairs to keep your moral high ground."
971,"not always, but most of the time. I’ve known them both for about 6 yrs, we’ve all been to festivals together - (including 33F).  The last couple of times I was round their house with both of them. "
972,There’s the comment I was looking for! The boyfriend is not harmed! The company is harmed! The boyfriend retains a right the company wanted him to give up. Act natural. 
973,"This thing called a compromise, it exists in relationships"
974,"I might be an insecure ass too, but I totally get Chris and at least I'm not the cool girl whose boyfriend is anywhere but with me and always too close with ""that one girl"" and I'm just standing there smiling pretending that everything is okay. 

It's good that Chris spoke up. It's obvious that he and OP have different perception of boundaries and that's a deal breaker any way you look at it."
975,He's not worthy of you.  He's clearly childish.
976,And she doesn't want to. So you need to let it go and get over yourself. 
977,What if it is too close to her rejection and she is just not ready for a relationship yet? 
978,And the law doesn't give a fuck how comfortable you are with you SO. Forgery is still a crime.
979,"I once broke up with a woman because she had 2 giant dogs who slept in the bed every night and annoyed me to no end. I love animals, but I love sleep more. "
980,"This was a few years ago. My ex's brother is guilty of this. He's 50 and posed as 35 on a dating site. He didn't look 35. He actually met someone who believed him and got her to move in with him. 

The age thing was just the tip of the clusterfuck iceberg. There might be other things, just keep your eyes and ears open, and trust your gut! "
981,"You can use soap on cast iron. You couldn't back when soap was made of lye, but you probably aren't using soap made from lye these days."
982,"If your wife is asking you for couples counseling, it means that there are other problems beyond how she likes her burgers salted, bud. Give it a try."
983,You can't be her best friend and pursue her at the same time. You can either choose to be her friend and support her or ask her out out and take step back from the friendship if she isn't ready to date. 
984,"Honestly, I wouldn't say anything and just be thankful you have such supportive parents. Starting to return the favor is a great way to show them how appreciative you are. "
985,"Tell her now that she’s a roommate and not a partner, give her legal  notice of a date she needs to be out by because you are going to change the locks on that date and she will not have a spare key. and tell her she needs to pay you rent based on a dollar amount for every day she is living there. The agreement as a couple was that you would cover rent but that agreement is no longer in place. Sit her down and talk to her about that. If she says she can’t afgoed to give you rent make her sleep on the couch and make it clear she is not allowed on the furniture. Should make her uncomfortable enough to leave. "
986,"I’m not sure how much more transparent she can be OP. Call me an asshole, but it sort of sounds like she is isolating herself from her social circle for you (or because of you). 
Do you have anything to confess? Because if someone is so obsessively checking on this stuff, it can stem from guilty feelings. 
"
987,"You come across badly here. As long as she is clean, she can do what she damn well likes when she is at home and relaxing. I bet she makes an effort when you guys go out, and that should be enough."
988,"This sounds like a good idea. What do you think would be the best way to approach this topic? I'm honestly not a guy who is very good with words and I tend to just steamroll people with my thoughts, which doesn't seem like the best approach here. "
989,Pls send them my address. 
990,Three words: *talk to him*.
991,"Have you considered that your bf might not be too sure about your future as a couple? I mean 2020 is still quite far ahead and right now, you're still in the honeymoon period.... A lot can happen till then."
992,Casually ask him about the 70's.  He should know.  He was there.
993,"There isn't. Some people have a compulsive relationship with it (as we can with anything fun) but porn addiction isn't in the DSM. There isn't a consensus that it's a real thing.

There are lots of perfectly healthy people like OP who are catching flack for it, of course. But that's just a controlling relationship."
