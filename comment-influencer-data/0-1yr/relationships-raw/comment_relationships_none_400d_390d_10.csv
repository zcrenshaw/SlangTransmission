Talk to your sister and develop conditions that your parents will approve of, and later give them to parents and announce them together to your sister. This way your parents will think they're ""in on it"" and won't feel like they're being cheated. Tell your sister to act surprised, maybe throw a tantrum or get a little upset. But between the two of you, you know what the real rules are."
1,"He sent pictures of himself fake crying? Jesus, if that’s not a turn off, I don’t know what is. "
2,"Not being stood up for teaches you, at the very least subconsciously, that you shouldn’t stand up for yourself.

There’s a reason that “you go girl” type of stuff got really popular. It helped struggling girls gain confidence and stand up for themselves when they might have otherwise felt like society didn’t have their backs.

By doing this you’re signaling to her that she would be in the right to stand up for herself too. Fuck that nonsense your friends said. Being an adult doesn’t mean you grew up right. She could very well have been bullied or had bad parents and never learned how to be hard, or even like she’s *allowed* to stand up for herself.

I was that girl and I was with my abusive ex for 2 years. Outward support is **powerful** and the only reason it lasted so long was because I was used to my dad yelling at me growing up so I always internalized it and thought I deserved it. I watched my mom witness my abuse and stay quiet and that taught me that I should be quiet too. Watching almost all these people quietly accept her being treated poorly likely had the same effect — feeling like it’s not that big of a deal and she’s not allowed to be upset, or that she’d be causing a scene by standing up for herself.

She deserves for society to have her back just like everyone else. Fuck being abandoned to deal with your own shit when clearly you’re being verbally abused. He was nasty as fuck and no one should have even wanted to be around him. Let alone some of you guys not only accepting him, but thinking other people should keep quiet as well. Yeesh."
3,"You absolutely have to ask him.  Just sit him down, tell him his mom showed you the painting, and ask why he's getting the same thing tattooed on him."
4,Your brother sounds amazing! Congrats on getting into your top choice!!
5,"Moping?! Nah. I mean i guess share with him your frustrations and give him a cance to change, but that would be a dealbreaker for me. "
6,"Matching shirts for the wedding party that say ""Please not here"""
7,"He offers a legal separation? Wow. I am so sorry. I can't even imagine my husband bringing up something like that with me and I'm not sure how I would respond to it - I'm trying to put myself into your shoes. I've kind of always wondered what an open relationship would look like and I don't know that I could do it without crossing boundaries (falling for someone) or getting jealous. 

The good news is that he told you. He was honest about what he wants. It's not crazy that he would consider or imagine having sex with another woman or other women. Many married folks have thoughts of straying or just having no strings sex with someone so that's not out of the ordinary. I guess the hard part for you is that he wants to act on it and make his fantasy a reality. That's where it gets dicey.

So, the bad news is that you two do not see eye to eye on this and he's spilled the beans and he can't take back what he blurted out to you even if he wishes he could. It's too late for that and now you're affected emotionally to the point where you are sick over it. Does he know how deeply this request has affected to you? It sounds like he doesn't realize the damage it's caused. If I were you I'd make it 100% clear to him that you have become devastated over this, feel like you can't trust him any longer, and are ready to file for divorce. Show him how upset you are. Don't laugh with him when he tries to joke about it and brush it off. You shouldn't laugh about it because to you, this isn't funny. Your feelings are valid and he needs to recognize it. 

No more jokes, no more pretending you're not crying everyday when you have been crying. Just be as honest with him as he was with you. I know sometimes things get to a point where you just can't talk anymore about what's already been discussed and it gets to be overwhelming and you're not getting anywhere anymore. If you talk it through, show him your honest feelings, and maybe even get some counseling together there might be a chance to salvage what you've got. If not, then I wish you luck. "
8,"This is the first real test in your relationship, but not quite in the way that you think.

First and foremost, don't assume that your bf's parents remember the reputation (no matter how awful it might have been) that a random teenager garnered in high school 8-ish years ago. Even in a small town, you've got to assume they have more to do than keep abreast of the teen gossip, much less connect that gossip they heard to the woman their son is dating in his mid-20's.

Second, your BF knew you in high school. Which means he knows these rumors are false and malicious. He also knows you now, so even if they were true, he should be proud of the person you are in 2018. Which brings us to the actual point:

So the test here is **to tell your boyfriend about your concerns.** Be honest with him. Tell him you're scared that your reputation and your past financial situation make you worry how they'll see you. If he's even remotely worthy of dating you, **he will be 100% on your side in making sure that IF his parents actually do know about anything of the things you mentioned that he's right there by your side to ensure they know those things are FALSE.** That's what a good partner would do.

You two should go into this dinner as a team, and I think you'll feel much better knowing you have ""backup"" in case things shake out even remotely the way you are worried they will. It'll be ok!"
9,"I think you handle the situation pretty well, the moment he started berating his girlfriend in public he made it a public thing therefore everybody's business, and you stepping in probably stopped the situation from escalating. "

11,"Don’t really have any advice, but you sound like a great brother. Carry on. "
12,"I've got to give your husband *some* credit because instead of just wandering off and having an affair like most people, he brought up his issues with you directly and then backed off when he realized what he was broaching was too hurtful for the relationship. He even committed to getting help. 

That's *something*. 

I can completely understand why you are hurt. It's incredibly hurtful to hear that from somebody and to think that you're not enough for your partner.

But I still see your husband struggling with these urges and trying to do the right thing by you. I feel like that might be enough for you to hold onto and to get through this.

He should follow through on therapy and you guys should get into couples counseling. See where this goes. He does seem to be committed to you and your marriage and fixing himself. That might be enough to make it through this."
13,"Dating is a series of auditions. If someone doesn't seem right for the role, you let them go. You don't try to make them be the right one."
14,Just tell her no? You seem to never make any kind of move to show her you are not okay with it
15,[removed]
16,"If you do this, you should also negotiate with your parents and make clear that if they cut access to your brother in any way, or send him to one of these bootcamps, the alleged ""restrictions"" on your sister will be gone. By ""giving"" them something they want, that puts youin a position of power. Don't squander it.

Oh, and carry on being a fantastic brother :-)"
17,"I think given that she reached out to you when the tables were turned, it's safe to say she'd want to know about this."
18,She clearly has issues from her parents divorce that she didn't take care of properly. She needs therapy. 
19,"&gt;  I guess the ways we each viewed that situation was too different for him (my putting work priorities before family), so he broke up with me when he came back. He said our views are too different 

Dude, no. Your views are different, but it's not work before family, it's acting like a grown-up and making plans in advance so you can afford your hotel room before sponging off your girlfriend. He made his own bed here.

I know this is painful, but sometimes break ups are the right answer."
20,"No OP, life has not magically “improved for the better”.... You MADE it better. "
21,"That's very paranoid behavior. People have work phones all the time , it's pretty normal though her reaction is not normal . I say cut your losses and move on. It sounds like she has some bad insecurity issues. Does she snoop through your personal phone? "
22,"&gt;browsing vibes together was a weird but fun experience!

Is it weird that this is oddly heartwarming? It just shows how good a space you guys are in now- this is a great update. Glad to hear an honest convo was enough to get you both on the same page, and that you're working together to find what works.  "
23,"&gt;She's stopped talking about him to me, but is actively talking about him to friends and she's still looking him up on social media.

Your fiancée wasn't ready for another relationship, let alone marriage.  She was with this other guy for less than a year and yet she's allowed her obsession to overshadow your relationship.  Not only that,  she flat out doesn't care about your feelings.  She dismisses your justified concerns and continues to obsess about the other guy.

I don't understand why you would punish yourself this way.   Shut down all the wedding planning, even if it means losing deposits.  Then tell your faux fiancée you are going to find  someone who will be happy to have you and never look back.


  "
24,"I'm flabbergasted that you would even consider giving up a lifelong hobby that you still enjoy immensely for a girl you've only been dating for ***TWO MONTHS!!!*** Even if she had the world's best reasoning, the decision to give up something like this over an 8 week long relationship would be really short sighted.

If her interest in dating you is contingent on whether or not you play chess, she can absolutely find someone else to date who fits her dating criteria."
25,"He meant to text someone else. He didn't forget you were best friends, he thought he was texting some other girl from the looks of the conversation. Sorry."
26,"I think you will both be better for it if she goes off to college and graduates. You both need real adult experiences on your own, and like you said, not to have things chosen for you. Give her a lot of space to make new friends and connections in college.

Once she gets older and independent enough to make her own decisions, you can see where you both are in life and reevaluate then. It could be neither of you are interested, or become different people once you get some experience.

Keep up with the therapy!"
27,"I would not stay in an apartment with roaches and rats. If that becomes a deal breaker, so be it.

Also, be careful he doesn’t bring any roaches to your place. They can hide in bags and travel to
the next destination. "
28,It sounds like he’s trying to pass off incompatibility as you not being good enough. 
29,"Good for her!

My mum had a small car crash with me in the car when I was 2-3 years old. Since then she has refused to drive again. That was 35 years ago.

My dad and sisters are fed up being her driver. I told her I wouldn't drive her anymore because she stresses me when she's the passenger. She's one of those who screams whenever something ""scary"" happens. Those ""scary stuffs"" are things that nobody else think is scary..."
30,"&gt;When I told him that I wasn’t ready for sex yet, he started to beg and say that he was suffering from the fact that we haven‘t had sex and that „a man needs sex“.

Red flaaaaag!  You don't owe anyone anything, let alone sex.  A guy who actually respects you might be bummed out, but he wouldn't pressure you or act like you owe him anything.  He's emotionally manipulative and I wouldn't waste your time on him.

&gt;Apparently, that day was an important date to him, because his favorite musician died and his favorite sports team won a game, and thats why he wanted to lose his virginity on that exact date.

This is so stupid.  I can't wrap my head around how stupid this actually is."
31,"It's funny because I have a lot of gorgeous friends who would always get hit on before me and when they said they had boyfriends the guys would turn to me like a second option. I felt like it was a great way to weed out guys. The one that's for you, will hit on YOU and think that you are the most beautiful girl. "
32,"&gt;So, this is where I need help. My SO gets very defensive during arguments and I want to raise this as non-confrontationally as possible. Although I've caught him lying, I feel infinitely ashamed that I snooped. How should I go about this reddit?

People assume that a ""break up"" requires an iron-class case, like as if you're going to court. It doesn't. You can tell him ""Hey, I know you're still talking to [ex], we're done"". You don't need to tell him how you know, or show your evidence. You don't need to feel like you can't break up with him, just because you snooped. 

He's proven time &amp; time again that he can't be trusted. Why bother?

You're unhappy, you deserve better, and you can leave."
33,"Thank you.  Thank you so much for standing up for this girl.  How many awful things have been done in this world because people didn't want to get involved?  Because they thought that it wasn't a big deal, or they didn't want to make a scene, or because they thought someone else was handling it? So many horrible things have been done because people lacked the courage of their convictions to stand up when they saw something was wrong.  You stood up.  Thank you.

As for your ""friends"" (who are kind of cowardly IMHO), they say, ""his girlfriend is a grown adult who can handle her own shit.""  Let's question that.  Your friend has become so comfortable with criticizing and berating his girlfriend that he now lets it be seen in public.  How much belittlement goes on behind closed doors to give him that sense of entitlement?  Enough to make him an emotional abuser?  This girl, who may will be emotionally abused, can NOT ""handle her own shit"" if all of her emotional energy is going towards keeping him appeased.  It will make her forgetful (feeding the meter), clumsy with nervous energy (spilling the water), and paralyzed into inaction (her inability to stand up for herself).  People who are locked in these toxic relationships do not have the perspective to see what it looks like to healthy individuals; you gave them both a reality check.

There are four parties here who owe you some gratitude.  First, there is the girl because you told her that she is worth defending.  Second, there is your friend because he needs to know that he is becoming a horrible person and that needs to be corrected.  Third, there are the other people there that night because they need to be reminded what it looks like to do the right thing.  And, fourth, you need to thank yourself because you can look at yourself in the mirror and know that you walk your talk.  Good job.  Keep it up."
34,"Incubation time 1-3 weeks, but it could be months, as there aren't obvious symptoms.  Plus 1.5 months since you noticed your symptoms.  So that puts your infection at 2 months ago.

Her incubation time 1-3 weeks ...  call it another month, so 3-4 months ago, estimated time of her contracting it.  Analyze her behavior back then, if possible; it's a major accusation, so take the time to think back and verify, if possible.

IMO, you know you didn't cheat, so you are suspecting and accusing her.  

From her point of view, she knows she didn't cheat, so she is suspecting and accusing you.  Especially after she demonstrated loyalty for 7+ damn years, you cheat on her after all that effort and trust she put in the relationship and you?  You're an asshole, she's revolted by you, and she's deeply hurt, and it's over, and she never wants to see you again.

Except she's not acting that way.  She's acting meek, and hopes that you won't accuse ~~falsely~~.  IMO she cheated, and she knows when.

36,"This sounds like the old “I don’t wanna be the ‘bad guy’ so I’m going to be such an intolerable intromittent organ that you break up with me” tactic.

I’d comply and break up. "
37,It's been only six weeks and you're already dealing with problems. This won't turn into something beautiful.
38,"""So I'm good enough to get her groceries but not good enough to be her granddaughter?"""
39,"You and your brother might end up being the only two truly happy people in your family. 

The rest of them sound miserable. "
40,"I'd normally be on her for misleading you for so long, but the 5 years of your relationship started when she was 16...I wouldn't expect *anyone* to know 100% their stance on big life things at that age, or even 18 or 20.  "
41,"""I'm concerned that we're just not very compatible, and he'll never understand.""

Your concerns are well founded, and probably correct. You guys just have differing views on a lot of important things, perfectly reasonable reason to break up."
42,"I don't understand how you found out about the ""which one, the sexy one or no?"" 

But between that and the ""he's not, trusttt meee, he's not"" (that ""friend is not your damn friend)...this sounds so immature. Not that people 20 or 40 years older than you can't be cruel (because they can), but I remember how insane the lack of mouth-filter was back then. 

Here's what: yes, you can do other things together with your BFF, but having a blast in clubs is kinda where everyone wants to be at your age. If you don't like clubs, don't go. But if you do, don't let some idiots deter you. When I look good, know I look good and look good for ME, no one derails that confidence. Sure, being BFF's with a goddess will suck sometimes, but be your own damn goddess. I hate my hair. My best friend has great hair. When we go out, she gets loads of compliments on her hair. Which makes me happy because she rocks. But that doesn't take away from me. I have a bunch of ish I rock just fine. 

And TELL her. She can tell something is up with you. I'm sure it would break her heart to know you're going through this. She will want to talk about it or help if she can. And she should know some guy she's interested in is making awwwful comments like above. "
43,"that's how I feel around literally every girl I know. I've always been the ""funny"" girl, the ""chill"" girl but also always the ""ew no, she's the ugliest of them"" girl. Sadly I do not have any advice for you because I simply got used to it and accepted it, but trust me that not everybody likes ""perfection"" and there is a ton of guys out there who would say you're the sexy one. Keep your head up girl! As you said, it's not your friend's fault but she should know about this. I'm sure you will find a solution together :)"
44,"If you want to be petty, reply to him saying ""Please don't e-mail me again."" and put her in CC."
45,"&gt;Should I move by myself and just have us visit in both directions for a while to ease her into the idea? 

At your age you absolutely need to put your career first and take this job.   Giving her a year to decide if she also wants to move is fine if you can both agree to it.   

&gt;I would then end up paying for two apartments (or one and a half I guess) in two of the most expensive cities in the country since she couldn't quite afford our current place by herself

Nope.  She can find a roommate to split costs in her current location assuming she continues to refuse to move.  You should not saddle yourself with paying her rent.  Pay out the lease you are currently in with the understanding that she will need to figure out her housing situation when the lease runs out."
46,Dude...come on. It's time to leave. For you and for your kid's sake.
47,"Then I guess he can have all the sex he wants. With himself. He is purposefully disregarding your feelings about your own body and your own autonomy. You don’t want to have sex in public places? Perfectly reasonable. Don’t do it, you could get in trouble."
48,"You have every right to call it a night whenever you feel is appropriate, especially if you have to work in the morning. Your boyfriend is being ridiculous."
49,"&gt;he offers legal separation?

I know right? WTF - he says he doesn't want to divorce but then offers up a serving of diet divorce? 

I think he's more serious about making this happen then he's letting on."
50,"You need to just sit her down and tell her that your preferred model for handling food is that you each buy your own groceries and cook your own meals. I've always had a ""condiments are shared"" policy with roommates because otherwise you end up with a fridge full of double and triple condiments, but whatever you prefer, you just need to make it clear.

This is one of those things that there's probably no way for you to keep it from being weird or awkward, because that's not in your control. All you can do is be clear, firm, and kind, and if she takes it badly that's on her.
"
51,"DO NOT RETURN TO YOUR HUSBAND.

Stay with your family, find a divorce lawyer and divorce him. Or just get the marriage annulled.

---

Your husband is an abuser. His threats of divorce are emotional abuse and all about control. 

If/when you call his bluff, his tune will change, but only long enough to get you on the hook again. Then he will slowly start ramping up the abuse again.

Accusing you of lying is basically gaslighting. Trying to get you to believe a false reality so that you will doubt yourself.

Dragging you in front of his family only to yell at you until you cry is just straight up abuse.

For your own safety and health, you need to leave this man."
52,"How has she got to 39 and not realised that the majority of people don’t have $400K in savings?

"
53,That's actually a nice plan. 
54,"That's awesome, I'm not premed but my degree had me working along side a lot of pre med students and the MCAT studying is no joke.. Really happy it all worked out for you two. "
55,"Why can't your wife help your Mom? Couldn't she go over and hang out with her while the water heater guys are there? You're taking care of two adults who don't have jobs -- I don't see why they can't help each other out with the day-to-day stuff. 

You have to put your foot down though. Write down a list of things you need to keep your sanity and work out solutions for each one. The first thing is the crying shit. Do not give into it. Your wife is a child and like a child she needs to cry it out. She's manipulating you because it works. Every single time she starts crying just calmly tell her, ""We need to have a serious discussion about this and that can't happen with you crying. We're going to discuss this again once you've calmed down.""

Then wait for her to finish and do it again. And again. And again. Consistently with every issue. If she wants you to do something you don't have the energy to do tell her no and let her cry. You have to stop this now because your kid is going to catch on soon that if she wails and screams she'll get whatever she wants. 

Separate the finances and get your family on a budget. Use prepaid debit cards for your wife if you have to. Figure out a timeline for when your wife needs to go back to work. You can't keep working two jobs. You're going to burn out. Discuss this with your wife and when she cries about being a terrible person be honest and tell her, ""Right now, you are being terrible. I need to be able to discuss my feelings with you without you crying and making it all about you."" 

It's going to be hard and you need to get tough and be a little selfish here. Your Mom comes last -- she needs to start adulting -- period. Show her how to do basic things, write out a list, and tell her to figure it out. Make yourself unavailable and start saying no. Tears be damned."
56,"&gt; Aww, you only get paid 15.50/hr? That's so little, I get paid 20/hr 

That's an asshole move by your boyfriend.  Regardless of all the other insensitive crap he's doing, this one is the worst.  That's not unintentional either, he's doing this on purpose."
57,OP will look back on this relationship in a few years and shudder. This may or may not be coming from personal experience.
58,"They think Computer Science isn't ""useful""? Are they aware that there are constantly tons of high paying jobs in high demand for that degree?? Good grief. Support that girl, especially if she's going into something like CS. It's hard, it can be isolating as a woman, and it's a great degree to have."
59,"I would have reacted the same way. He's within his rights to tell you he doesn't want to be exclusive, and kudos for his honesty. You're also within your rights to stop seeing him, and if you've already started getting attached or seeing yourself developing feelings, it was the wise thing to do. "
60,"Oh my god. Oh my GOD.

Your girlfriend is .... that is awful. Awful. She gaslit everyone about this poor girl and made everyone hate her... for what? What did it gain her? She manipulated everyone, including you, and you played right along with the cruelty. Monica dropped out of school because everyone thought she was a crazy when she was telling the truth. Callie literally ruined this girl’s life. 

Your girlfriend is really something. And not something good. "
61,Don't let her in the Dr. Office with you.  Make her wait in the lobby. You are a grown ass woman. Don't rely on her for transportation if you don't want to deal with her.

66,"&gt;When I shouted for him to help me take some toilet paper he actually refused to and said that I should have made sure there was toilet paper before using the toilet and he was really angry that I asked for his help.

What the fuck? There’s something incredibly off about his mentality here. That’s the sort of thing that I’ve asked of family, friends and occasionally strangers in public bathrooms. No-one has refused me or even done it grudgingly. Because it’s not a big deal, it doesn’t take much in the way of time and effort and the alternative is for someone to soil their underwear going to get their own paper. 

What if you were to get really sick and couldn’t look after yourself for a while? Do you think he would put aside his extreme pettiness and rigidity to be a half-decent husband instead of a difficult roommate? In any case, the way he’s behaving right now is unacceptable. 

At the very least, take kids off the table until he has stopped behaving like this. This attitude of “it’s every person for themselves,” would be absolutely hideous to bring into parenting. "
67,"I'm a little older (32) and being attractive has nothing to do with how happy my friends' relationships are. I know some really geeky looking people, some obese people, etc, who are in ridiculously happy healthy relationship. I know utterly beautiful people who have just never made it work.

ALSO you know what sucks about being pretty? Guys date you just because they want to fuck you, not because they care about about your personality. All these guys hitting on your friend? What do they know about her personality, interests, or intelligence? Nothing. All they know is that she's hot. Imagine how much time your friend is going to waste on guys who don't love her.

Moral of the story is, if you're looking for true love, looks aren't the key.

Edit: loving these replies"
68,"Anxiety ruins everything. If you had friends on the trip you'd have anxiety about which friends. If there was no trip, you'd have anxiety about being home, or going to the mall, or not being home, or not going to the mall. You see what I mean. Anxiety chews you up inside and out about every issue and every non issue in life.

The only issue you need to talk to your parents about is how to seek the proper treatment for anxiety. You're young. You can either enjoy the youth ahead of you or have anxiety make you miserable more times than necessary. The look back on the latter choice isn't a good one.

Start talking to them honestly about your anxiety and possibly seeing a doctor or therapist. Go on the trip.

69,"For future reference for anyone who might not know, you can mute posts on IG in addition to muting their stories so they don't come up in your feed.  

Anyway, I think she's being very immature about this. "
70,"Please see a counselor, even if just to vent to someone removed from the situation.

Also perhaps some reframing may be useful. As a father, your children’s needs are paramount, as is your own wellbeing, enabling you to be whole and present in their lives. Unsupportive wife and mother’s requests, if push comes to shove, are secondary. Any issues, big or small, coming between your kids’ need for you to be there and be well can be rightfully framed as such, and might help you begin to set necessary boundaries. Best of luck."
71,"This needs to be addressed by her father.  And he's the one who needs to get his head out of his rear and realize this is more serious than what he thinks.  Why?  Because the reality of the situation is that a 13 year old girl is telling everyone that she has a boyfriend who is actually a man in their 30s.  Regardless of how you look, the age on your ID is what's most important.  All you need is a parent who doesn't know the whole story reporting you to the authorities and this whole situation blows up.

You're absolutely right to nip this in the bud, immediately if not sooner.  Press on your fiance that you two need to be a united front on this and work together to resolve this.  If you need to consult a family therapist for a few sessions to work on the communication, that would likely also be a benefit."
72,I think this is a good idea and fully support you. 
73,"You can get the dress fixed. However, you can't fix someone who doesn't place value on things that you care about.

To me, this is pretty bad. I know it's not popular by people in our age demographic (idk if I'm still in yours, 25 girl) to put value on things, but I do. 

If someone broke anything of mine that I cared about and didn't even feel sorry, and made fun of me or put me down for crying about it, then that would be it for me. I would dump them. He's not a considerate person."

78,"It sounds like she knows you don't like her and she figures, if you are all going to be hanging out together in a group, you should try to all get along - the necklace seems more like a peace offering than anything.

It seems like their relationship was bad, but she doesn't seem particularly toxic, based on what you've said here - they're just not right for each other. 

Also, it seems like you're judging Annette pretty heavily here - you admit to not knowing her all that well, but think you have her all pegged down. Many people who act happy all of the time are actually suffering on the inside. "

Hahahaha, that sounds about right. Beggars can't be choosers. This lady isn't getting any help because she's a massive sexist. 

You are doing the exact right thing. Your grandma is toxic and has never lifted a finger for you her entire life. She isn't family. She's a stranger that despises you for your gender. You are well within your rights to refuse your dad's request. Your dad has some serious issues to work through."

82,"First of all, it isn’t okay for him to speak to you like this. 


Second of all, you are not an “idiot” and I hate that anyone has made you feel this way for doing something as simple as forgetting the day. You need to work on your esteem so you feel comfortable standing up for yourself.  


Third, you have every right to be hurt. Communicate it to him. "
83,"&gt;I have always made it clear ( or thought I did) that when I am proposed to I want it to be very intimate with nobody around but the two of us

And in your edit


&gt;I hinted here and there but we never had a proposal talk where I clearly stated I didnt want people there.


Hinting is not a good communication strategy. There is also no such thing as ""flat out hinted"" - unless you two had a clear conversation about both of your expectations and wants specifically surrounding a proposal, it's safe to assume none of your hints made it through. Really seems like this ultimately isn't a big deal, I'd just recommend having a conversation about communicating and make sure y'all are on the same page for the future.

85,"My husband proposed at a concert.  Someone next to us said “omg he’s proposing!!” And I wasn’t paying attention and started looking all around and yelled “who’s proposing?!”   Hellllllooolo your boyfriend is down on one knee, asshole.

86,"Stop inviting him over. When he asks, tell him it's because of the smell. Be blunt. Time to stop worrying about hurting his feelings. "
87,"Hi OP,

I'm bisexual. You've gotten a lot of good advice and perspectives here so far so there's just one more thing I want to add. In the bisexual community, there's a phenomenon called the ""bi-cycle"" where your attraction to each gender will fluctuate greatly. One month you may find your attractions pretty evenly split. Another month you might find yourself obsessed with men. The next month you might find men to be just okay and your focus is mostly on women. This is understood to happen to many bisexual men and women. (You can check out r/bisexual and you'll definitely see a few posts about it.)

If he's just becoming comfortable with this side of himself, it makes some amount of sense that his attention is more on the masculine. This doesn't mean that that is how it will always be. In a month, you might find that he can't get enough of PIV intercourse. Of course, you also might not.

All that said, it's also supremely important that you feel valued and validated in your relationship. I recommend having some heart to heart conversations about your concerns and the way his comments made you feel. The bi-cycle isn't an excuse to make your partners feel worthless or less than. It's more akin to just fluctuating sex drives in general: sometimes people are super sexually driven and sometimes not, and I think this is a natural fluctuation for anyone....but when someone's in their ""not"" stage, they should still try their best to make you feel important, desirable, and valued. That's something he should be able to understand and meet you halfway on.

I hope this helps! "
88,"I guess the curiosity can eat you up, but man. Most sex absolutely sucks. Finding an unselfish generous attentive partner who knows what you like is way superior. He's going to get his rocks off and then probably realize it was better with you."

No seriously, no reason to stay with this guy. Zero. Cut him loose. You’ll find someone who matches you better, sexually, emotionally, everything. 







If I could go back in time and explain to myself that sex should be fun otherwise don’t fucking bother, I can instantly think of a half dozen people I would have turned down and at least as many I wouldn’t have slept with twice. 






Stop caving to his silly expectations of how much sex he thinks you should be having. Quality over quantity my friend has rarely been more relevant a phrase than when talking about sex. "
92,"Don't you dare cancel that suit order.

My husband and I both work full time and have joined finances. That being said, we have separate accounts that have our 'spend money' in it for each of us. That's $500 a month for us to use at our discretion. No judgment. 

So that's what you need to do. You need to separate your spend account, and this way you can spend your money on what ever you want without the other saying  anything. If you feel like letting your money roll over each month so you can make a big purchase in the future, that's your decision. If she wants to blow through hers every month, that's up to her. **Separate petty cash accounts.**"

What I do believe is that your husband is an abusive jerk. One who's almost certainly made you believe that you're an idiot.

You're not. And you deserve better."
108,"I’m also so glad OP said something. I was also that girl for 3 years and my bf’s friends never said anything to him. They’d make VERY minor comments to me when he was out of earshot but I always thought that I was overreacting or being dramatic because people saw and heard him and never said a word to him. I always just assumed I was too sensitive. And then we broke up and I was devastated, while all of HIS friends were like “why are you so sad? We all heard him abuse you for years.”

It’s not like you were loudly swearing in front of children at church. Maybe it’s an issue of compatibility. If you’re a more outgoing, carefree person, you shouldn’t have to feel embarrassed about that because your boyfriend is uncomfortable. It’s really frustrating to feel like you can’t be yourself around your significant other or feel like they’re embarrassed of you. Have you talked to him about it or how often it seems to happen? Did he have anything to say? "
112,"Ask him about it. 

You don’t know the story behind the painting yet. It’s possible that it’s the symbolism of two lions that was always special to him, and that that was why the ex painted it, and that that is why he wanted a tattoo of two lions. 

Don’t jump to conclusions,  and don’t play games. Tell him how you felt when you saw the tattoo and just ask him about it. You might not like what you hear, or it might make perfect sense- either way you will have the answer. "
113,"I agree with all of this...until I’m reminded of the legal separation suggestion. That doesn’t seem fully committed to the marriage.

128,"That’s what is frustrating me about this thread. People are acting like OP’s husband is such a good communicator and should be commended for discussing this with her and I would totally agree... except that his response to her refusal was a nuclear bomb. 

Based on what OP wote, this is the first time he has ever brought up an open marriage. In fact, this is a total about face from what he has been telling her for their entire relationship. People are allowed to change their minds and I think it’s good that he brought it up to her... But the next step is not, oh hey, you aren’t on board with this totally new and huge change to our relationship dynamic? Time for a legal separation, aka the first steps to divorce.

It feels like he asked her about an open marriage (only on his side? It’s not clear in the post) because he wanted permission to sleep with other women and not have it be infidelity. Once that option was shot down, he went for option B, which was a legal separation, where he could still sleep around and not call it cheating but he could “get it out of his system” and go back to his wife and tell her he was wrong, they should stay together, she’s the only one for him, etc etc.

Idk, if the husband had come to her with just the conversation, listened to her when she said it wasn’t for her, and then suggested couples counseling because it was something he couldn’t let go... I would be on his side. But how he brought it up and the bombshell of a separation makes me understand why the OP has been crying. 

"
129,"I had to check his age again.

30? Very immature. If he needs to party during a workweek night, that's okay. Being sulky because you go home after spending 6hours with him? Not so much.

Find someone who treats you with respect, calls you if you got home safe and supports your decision to be a responsible adult. "
130,Sounds like she’s being emotionally manipulative to keep you on the hook while she has her freedom from the relationship. I wouldn’t trust her. Don’t reply to her. Block her if you need to if it’s messing with your head and keeping you from moving on. 
131,"You weren't wrong to let your boyfriend know how you were feeling. What I don't understand is why you are so upset about it now. You told him how this was making you feel and he changed his plans. So... what is the issue? That he's sad that he didn't get to see his best friend? That seems like a normal reaction. 

It sounds like you have some personal issues around this friend of his. If I was in your shoes I would be going out of my way to try and connect with her and see if you do like her. Flakey is annoying but this person is important to your partner. And it's going to be no fun being in a relationship with this guy if you dislike and resent his best friend. There must be something redeeming about her... I would be working on finding that instead of building up more reasons not to like her. "
132,"What you're doing in this comment is worrying about his intention behind his actions and ignoring the actions. He has control over his actions and behaviours, you should trust your gut feelings on the bad vibe you're getting from this. 

Also girl, get your self-esteem in check! Your self-defeating, put-downs are not doing you justice. You write intelligently, compassionately, you clearly care for others, see the good in them, and have an interest in the world around you. You're not ""uninteresting"", you don't have to ""be a better person for him"" you just need to start respecting and loving yourself. 

Get rid of disrespectful boyfriend and get into some therapy. I'm struggling with self-love and self-confidence myself at 26 and I wish I did something about it at your age instead of settling with my own self-loathing. Good luck OP and I hope you take everyone's advice with deep consideration &lt;3"
133,"Here's the thing... besides your cultural stigma, anything to do with marriage and partnership is dead in your relationship. You don't want to have sex with him, you don't want to have kids with him, you have lost trust, respect, and basic decency. He is only you husband in name. 

Let's be clear - he exploited you. He pimped you out on the internet with zero privacy and with zero permission. If he had released a sex tape, it would be the same. He indulged in his kink without consulting you and made you a very unwilling participant. 

If you can, I would recommend leaving him. You say the reason for the divorce will come out. Is there any way for you two to come to a consensus about a ""no-fault"" reason for the divorce?"
134,You asked him to respect your time and he got mad at you. I think this one is worth letting go.
135,"Time for some relationship counseling. This is *one* of the many issues that you need to be able to discuss and come to some kind of middle ground on before you get married. 

Seriously. Find a counselor. It's good to have someone who can guide you in conversations. 

For what it's worth: I (and quite a few studies) agree with you. Staying together for the kids isn't a good idea. Staying *friends* or at least friendly coparents is much better. Yes, you may not live together or be married, but if you can get along, the kids still get to have both parents actively in the picture and don't have to deal with animosity. 

Also, kids aren't stupid. They know when there's trouble in the relationship. And with some people, those troubles are going to be even more obvious. 

I also want to say, at 24, she's still fairly young and some of these ideas may evolve or change, especially with counseling. "
136,"""Sex is like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's good.""

second, I think this is proof that he is not over his ex and this would be a deal breaker for me. and/or he is literally not in his right mind, as this is very strange. "
138,"He said you sound dumb? Huh. I wonder how he'd react if you started hanging out with one of your friends at your place *every day.*


Having long-term friends is great. He needs to understand that this would be annoying regardless of gender. Nobody would want to be the third wheel in their own relationship.

This is exactly it. He's jealous. I mean, I'm envious and it sounds like you get to enjoy some perks whilst doing your job. But this is your Boyfriend, someone who should love and want the best for you, and be happy that you're getting treated nicely and get to enjoy aspects of your job. If he's not satisfied in his job then he should get a new one, but it's not his, or anyone elses place, to criticize your job"
142,"Are you sure that her relative actually offered to pay thousands of dollars for her travel expenses to this destination wedding? Seems like kind of a frivolous thing to give someone money for. 

I wonder if she asked them for the money to pay for her dogs emergency operation as well and they agreed because it’s her beloved pet, maybe she’s just playing you both. 

If not, this would still be a dealbreaker for me. She should be far more concerned with paying you back vs. going to this destination wedding solo. 

 "
143,"&gt; I immediately asked my boyfriend to explain and he’s basically ignored me since then.

This is not a good sign, does he always ignore you like this when you ask him difficult questions?"
144,"&gt;He’s talking about having kids and getting married all ready and I don’t know how to softly tell him I’m not ready for that. **He asks me daily “ do you want my babies “** and I never quite reject it in fear of starting a fight or hurting his feelings  

What the actual fuck OP. You have been dating a month and he is already talking marriage and babies, plus accusing you of cheating when you hang out with male friends. If your family is upset because you ended a month long relationship that says more about them.  There are so many glaring red flags in this post. RUN."
145,"I'm with your husband on this.

&gt;but she is not a BAD person.

&gt;my sister is rude and has always been just a rude sister to all of us 

""My sister isn't a bad person. She's just insufferable and immature.""

You're perfectly free to pursue a relationship with your sister. That doesn't mean that anyone else in your life is obligated to, including your husband. 

&gt;I have tried to explain to him that for my sister, it seems like we don’t love her because we never include her and it puts me in the middle. 

Instead you make it look like you don't care about your husband instead by making him choose the person you admit is rude to everyone despite being a grown woman. Who cares if she feels bad? Tough shit. She should learn then that if you're rude to everyone then no one will want to be with you.

Furthermore

&gt;she isn’t going to change until SHE hits a point where she will change.

No, she won't change because you coddle her and teach her that her actions have no consequences. You also try to force others to go along with it because consequences will make your sister feel bad.

You're perfectly capable of pursuing a relationship with your sister on your own. You're absolutely being selfish by making your husband do it too.

Why does your husband have to be in the same car as her and why do you have to bring him with you to dinner when you're in the same town with her? You're also a grown woman. You can drive your car with her or you can tell her sorry but no. You can also split off from your husband for a night and have dinner with your sister rather than force him to cater to her too.

You're actively and consistently choosing to prioritize a selfish rude sister over your husband who's only ""negative"" quality in your post is ""He doesn't want to spend his free time with a rude person."" It's selfish and I guarantee you will come back to harm your relationship.

**EDIT: Also want to give one last piece of advice:**

Being a considerate person doesn't mean doing what you want until someone has had enough. It means consciously being aware of your actions' effects on people even when they don't outwardly show negative emotions.

Your husband has been trying to tell you how he feels about your sister and you repeatedly ignore what he's trying to tell you. He may not have yelled or snapped at you but I guarantee that your husband is building resentment inside from his own wife not taking his feelings into consideration.

You should *really* stop and think how you're treating your husband. From this post it sounds like you think that so long as your husband doesn't outwardly get angry that you can continue to put yourself first without consequence. That's not how people work. You need to be aware that your actions are negatively affecting both your husband and your relationship even if he hasn't said anything up to this point.

You should filter through breakup posts on /r/relationships and sort by controversial. Many of them follow a common theme: They took advantage of their partners' kindness and assumed that because they didn't complain too much that everything was okay. One day their partner has had enough and leaves. OPs then realize that they should have taken their partners' words more seriously when they brought up how upset they were, and despite OPs' efforts to change the partner is now gone because the emotional damage is irreparable.

Don't let that be you. Someone snapping/getting angry/telling you that they've had enough isn't a sign that you should now stop and be more considerate of that person. It's a sign that you should have stopped a long time ago and there is a good chance that by then it's too late to fix anything."

150,"Ok, seriously the best advice you can possibly get right now is to delete this post and cease speaking to anyone, online or otherwise, about your situation. Then hire a lawyer and an accountant. Looking at the facts as you have laid them bare, something extremely suspect is going on.

151,"Firstly, I'm SO GLAD to hear you're not going out with that manipulative idiot anymore. You should be punching the air — you're free! It's sad to hear that he's torturing some other chick now, but that's not your concern. 

&gt; Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this pain and betrayal? 

Firstly, find your righteous anger. The dude is an asshole loser who thinks he's an actor who is still taking classes at 37. (Remember this when you are 37; believe me, you'll find it funny.) (NOTE: Nothing wrong with improv classes — I've taken many. Which is why I know these kinds of dudes.) 

Secondly, refocus. Your mother is dying. I spent the last two years with a dying friend – he succumbed to cancer a month ago. And now I'm a carer for my elderly parents. *Every* moment counts. You will struggle to remember this guy's name in a decade, but you will remember every moment with your mom. Focus on her. 

Thirdly, get some help. You are clearly stressed and anxious beyond belief. A psychologist, stat. 

Fourthly, are you starting grad school or not? Make a decision. Do not collapse into a puddle on the floor — can you put it off for a year, or do you need to start to keep your job? Either way, make a decision and then focus on that decision. 

Fifthly, where are your friends and family? You need your support system around you right now. Even if it's one person, reach out. 

&gt; How am I trust someone again? All my relationships previously have ended amicably and we’ve remained friends. This is the first time I’ve experienced break up pain to this magnitude.

Don't even worry about that now. The fact that you've had healthy relationships previously just proves you know how to pick the right people. You messed up once. Later on you can analyse that, work out how he fooled you, and learn not to get fooled again. But don't worry about that now — focus on your mom, on school, on work, and on the people who really love you. 

"
152,"My ex gave me a nickname that i identify with to this day (and a lot of my friends began to use). It has become part of my identity irrespective to her. I might actually get a visual based on that tattooed one day.

I would say it was very stupid of him to get that artwork tattooed without discussing it with you even if his intentions were super pure, but apparently he doesn't know you know. 

I'd say discuss this with him honestly first before accepting random redditors instantly declaring him guilty of everything ever

Edit: I know it's hard to relate to this thinking if you don't have tattoos or just have meaningful ones, but for a lot of people their tattoos don't have to mean anything. It's really just a pretty design on their skin. 

So if he is well and truly over his ex, I could see him finding that painting and being like ""wow this is a badass artwork.""

In short, this looks bad and COULD be bad but talk to him before making any decisions! "
153,"What I see is a man who was having a lot of fun bullying you and is now desperately trying to keep his job. You, of course, wouldn't be that unprofessional, but people like that judge everyone by themselves, and if he were in your position he'd be firing you, so he is FRANTIC to backpedal and convince you it was all in good fun.

Be professional and very detached and chilly toward him and do your job. ~~You may want to check in with HR and mention that he has spent the last X years bullying you and you'd like them to know that just in case he accuses you of retaliation.~~Edit: you probably don't want to do this; it was a thought and there are some excellent comments below about why you shouldn't.

And then rock it like the rock star you are, okay? :)"
154,"I don’t think you can show up on tinder if you aren’t actively using the app. I mean you might if the last time you were on it was like 3 days ago, but not a year as far as I know. "
155,"Number one was your chance OP. She wasn't sure if she was intruding, so she straight up asked you, and you still didn't make it clear. That kinda set the precedent for the rest.

Just tell her that you're sorry you weren't clear about it before, but that you don't like her eating your food. Totally reasonable thing to want. Tell her you'll let her know if you ever have extra."
156,I think you should go with your “normally I’d break things off straight away” option. You now know what he does when you are unavailable.
157,"It's completely unfair. And he's clearly so financially insecure he's willing to burn the entire relationship to the ground to avoid it.

This is an issue that requires therapy for him. He basically has a phobia of being unemployed because of his childhood. Unless he processes this trauma, it will continue to negatively impact your relationship."
158,"I'm really annoyed with people lecturing you about all the big tests in his future and saying he needs to get it together. It's missing the point in my opinion. Admittedly, I'm not in that field at all so I don't know what this kind of stress feels like. 

That being said, my take away from this is that you two talked, found a solution and moved forward. Next time a big stressful test comes up you already have some kind of system and you know it takes work on both sides. Your relationship grew because of this and you were able to support him while not feeling used. 

Great job to both of you! Also, great job to your boyfriend for being such a hard worker. I'm glad things worked out. "
159,"Yeah, this was him pretending like there was an issue that existed that didn't. He basically invented excuses once he realized she wasn't going to let him sponge off her anymore, so he doesn't have to seem like the bad guy

Good riddance. 

OP,  I know it hurts but that'll pass! Good luck!"
160,"Thank you for calling out your asshole friend, seriously. You did the right thing. If he's like this in public he's worse in private. He's likely always been this way, even with his other girlfriends, he's just finally showed his ass in public. Your friends saying she's an adult and should handle her shit are also assholes. I hope she breaks up with him."
161,"Ask him to move out. If not for yourself, do it for your mother ...she doesn’t deserve the extra workload to allow herself to feel comfortable in her own home because of the choices you’re making. "
162,Nope. Sounds normal to me. Pretty sure the way it's structured there isn't really time to sit and get to know the people you are with. Did martial arts twice a week for years as a kid and I didn't even know the names of some of the people I trained with. 
163,Dude hes fallen for your bestfriend. It doesnt even sound like he *likes* you anymore. Just move on.
164,"It's normal to get crushes on people throughout your life, even if you are in a relationship. **How you deal with it, is what will set you apart as an adult, and a loving partner.**

You know your feelings are becoming/ have already become inappropriate. So you take steps to stop this. Stop texting her about non-work related stuff. Stop going out to places she will be, stop putting yourself in situation where you have 'moments' with her. You make it sound like this stuff is out of your control, it is completely within your control. 

Second you need to realize you don't **really** know this woman. What you know is very basic surface stuff. You dont know what she is like when she is upset and gets mean, you don't know if she is a slob at home, if she kicks puppies in her spare time. You and your fiance have been together 8 years. You know everything about each other, the good, the bad, the ugly. You need to stop romanticizing the situation with your co-worker. Think of it this way. This woman is in a relationship, and also knows you are getting married. If the 'moments' you guys have been having are real, do you think you could ever really trust her? If she is willing to flirt with an engaged man while in a relationship, how do you know she wouldn't do that if she was with you as well?

Now lets think about your fiance. How would she feel if she found out about all this? **The woman you have been with and loved for 8 year.** The pain you are putting her through right now, she knows something is up, but not what. If you were to drop everything for this silly crush, how much of your world would crumble, and how much of her life would you be screwing up? Family, friends?

Go home to your fiance, start dating her again, and reminding yourself what a good thing you have. Bring her flowers, go on a weekend staycation somewhere in your state, have a wild night in bed with her. Look through all the photos you have together with her of the past 8 years. I am married, and have also been with my husband 8 years. Love and Marriage isn't a Disney Movie, its not this magic thing that makes everything better and work out. **It takes work.** So stop focusing on this other woman, and start focusing on your fiance."

166,Then you can't live with him. You need to tell him that he needs to get a paying job (he can write too) and contribute to the bills or you will have to find a different roommate situation with someone who is willing to contribute. You need to be serious about not living with him or don't say it. 
167,"Thanks, just trying to take care of my little siblings. "
168,"Yeah, he's being a total baby. You are 100% in the right here."
169,"I’m glad you are getting help. It sounds like you could use some distance from your uncle. Maybe even if you don’t enjoy it try to meet some new people (even if online). Also give her some space so she can get over her romantic feelings and get to know people her age. 

I’m glad she also seems to be getting out of this environment. The fact that her parents wanted to marry her off at 18 to a man almost a decade older so she wouldn’t go to college is incredibly creepy and gross. 

I wish you both the best of luck in finding your own paths without the involvement and grooming of other people."
170,"&gt;Can I just step out of everything?

Yes. And as a parting gift, you might want to do the rest of humanity a public service and buy him a jumbo box of condoms. "
171,"If I was your current girlfriend I'd be pretty mad seeing you tidy my stuff away for your ex to spend the night. You didn't do your ex wrong, she's overreacting. You are not a monster but I think you need to ask your current girl how she felt about it and sort that  out."
172,"I really doubt anyone except your mom is upset or even cares. If extended family cares who is in your wedding party, they need a life and actual things to worry about.

Do what you want. You are under no obligation to fulfill anyone's requests unless they are paying."
173,"He needs help. He knew the dryer was free but wanted to play a game to make you feel bad. This is not acceptable. 

I get the feeling from the way you talk about yourself that he probably does this all the time. I can tell by the way you write that you are NOT an idiot. He may know more things in certain areas than you do, but that doesn’t make you dumb. 

I think instead of responding, you take a hard look at your relationship. It sounds abusive. 

P.S. If someone in the house is doing laundry, they can do everyone’s laundry. Or at least wash and dry it and hand off the folding/putting away to someone else. “I only do my laundry” is for roommates, not family. "
174,Screenshot his text to you and sent it to her
175,"Don't settle for someone who doesn't enjoy making sure that you're enjoying yourself.  Learn this now, and save yourself many years of self centered partners and bad sex."
176,"Yea I see that now.  When we got married, I promised to love her in sickness, she's sick, but shes not trying to get better.  So yeah, I'm cutting her out."
177,Yeah you should seriously reconsider whether you should continue to be friends with people this tactless and stupid. 
178,"This hits home to me man, my dad didn't pass away, but he did cheat on my mom and bail on her when he was her only financial support. It left me in a bad situation of taking care of a wife and 3 kids, and my mother and her special needs brother(my uncle). I was the only one working as welll. I did it for 5 years and was practically a zombie. I ended up abusing painkillers just to get through the day to day of it all. One day it was like I woke up and just said fuck this. Took my wife and kids and moved into a seperate house, told my mom it was time to grow up and learn to take care of herself. Told my wife that she needed to get a job because obviously she wasn't cut out for the stay at home mom gig. It was really fucking hard at first but it's been two years now and I can honestly say I'm glad I did it. Completely changed my life. "
179,Really fucking hope he gets his shit together during med school and residency. Y'all got a long 7+ years ahead of you.
180,"Blood all over the place could violate local/federal labor laws or maybe OSHA regulations.

But if he's ownership... you're probably not gonna be able to fix this AND keep your job.  "
181,That would be an addiction. Your wife needs help if she can't detach from her phone for a few hours for quality time with her husband.
182,"Yes! I remember seeing somewhere a couple with a similar story. For their engagement pictures they held up cute little signs saying:

He asked

She said ""Oh God no""."
183,You are a good man. Your friend sounds abusive. Your other friends sounds like weak sheeple. We need more ppl in the world like you -ppl who speak up for what is right. I would have done the same and so would my bf. But I am so surprised that so many ppl just follow the crowd it's so annoying. Group think.

185,"It sounds like your boyfriend vents his emotions by yelling at you &amp; then he feels better &amp; is “over it.” Not only is that an unhealthy way for him to process those emotions (because then it makes it your job to deal with being yelled at), but it’s also really hypocritical to think that crying as an outlet is unacceptable but yelling as an outlet is fine. "
186,"&gt;Because it’s not a big deal, it doesn’t take much in the way of time and effort

It's not because he can't be bothered - he's explicitly told her he does it because he thinks she's spoiled and needs to be ""taught a lesson"". Which is a really gross attitude to what is supposed to be an equal partnership."
187,"OP, what’s safest for you is to worry about taking care of yourself. She doesn’t seem like a safe friend. She’s not your sponsor. She has bigger problems than you can handle. 

You did the right thing with this situation. "

189,"&gt; At one point, he dragged me to his parent's house, bashed me in front of them, screamed and called me a liar, and left me crying on the couch by myself in front of his mom and dad.

Divorce him. Are you up north now? If so, stay there."
190,"I'm not sure where you're living, but in most American cities, $28k a year is nothing - it's frankly amazing that she's managed to put anything in a 401k. 

Why can't she use her degree? Does she want a new job? Does she enjoy what she's doing? Does she lean on you for help, or do you just want someone who can afford a nicer lifestyle? I'm going to go ahead and say that she's doing REALLY well managing such a small income, and if she's not interested in pursuing higher paying work, then you can't reasonably expect her to save more. 

If she wants to find more lucrative work, give her your support and help if you can. If not, then it sounds like an affluent lifestyle is just more important to you than it is to her. "
191,"If she really got spontaneous chlamydia that she can't account for, she would be asking you a lot more questions and not be trying to stay on your good-side. She initially asked you because I think she hoped that you both had cheated and neither could be blamed/she could blame you. She knows what she did but can't admit it to you or herself because then she would have to accept she is a shitty person."
192,"OP, immediately filing for divorce and cutting all contact with this woman wouldn't be considered overreacting in this situation. What you're doing is being a doormat. Get away from her as fast as you can."

196,"&gt;I basically just need to know, do I leave him?

my god YES. If that woman had been down for it he would have cheated on you with her.

And more to the point - you simply can't trust him. You keep catching him in lies. His word isn't worth anything, what will it mean when a proven liar says ""I do""?"
197,"Seconding this Op. Shes your best friend, you should be able to tell her anything. Tell her how you feel. My best friend and I had an awkward few times when we went out, you know why? Both of us felt ""showed up"" by the other and it was fucking with our self esteem. My best friend is curvy with big breasts and an awesome butt, super long hair and her makeup game is on point. I am tall and thin, have no ass/barely any boobs, and my naturally curly hair likes to turn into a poof when I try to straighten it. When we went out, I felt like a dude next to her and told her as much during a drunken moment of vulnerability.

Best thing I couldve done. We laughed and laughed and laughed because she thinks Im stunning and I think shes stunning and you know what? We're both right. We are our own worst critics; find things about you that you love and rock it! And, tell your best friend. You'll both feel better :)"
198,"I mean, he let her go to the ER alone while he was on a raid.  I think he's made his priorities clear. "
199,"Sooooo glad things have worked out so well for you! It’s so hard to leave, but absolutely worth it in the end! "
200,"I also think it has to do with the abandonment feelings from her childhood. 

This sounds like something for a professional. Her anxiety around this isn't healthy for anyone, much less a child that needs to feel like both their parents are partners and support each other. 

FWIW, I don't agree with the girlfriend/fiancee. Kids are very perceptive and as much as you think you are hiding from them and pretending it is ok, it isn't enough. And knowing something is wrong and only seeing little pieces and clues fucks with a person's head, especially kids. People don't give kids enough credit. "
201,[deleted]
202,That's nightmare fuel.
203,"She didn't just run home and try to forget about the night. She ran and called the police. She tried to get help.

You're right, people don't know how they'll react in that kind of situation. Fortunately those situations don't come up super often, but it also limits how much experience an individual will have with them. If it was two girls, drunk, vs a highly aggressive guy... it seems like running would have been best for both of you once the pepper spray failed (which you should write the manufacturer about).

And think about how things *actually* played out. You went down, and he went after her. She led him off and away from you. That was one of the better potential outcomes there.

As a guy, if I were in that situation, I would want my girlfriend/wife to put distance between the two of us and call the police. If the guy went after her and she could get away, I'd absolutely want her to do that. Once the police are called, there's a countdown on the assaulter being found and stopped. That's one of the ways to put an end to the situation.

No offense meant to your two guy friends, but they're young and they're looking at that through male eyes. They may not have thought the whole situation through from her (or your) perspective. If you have concerns about it, you can talk to her about how she feels about the night, and lead the conversation in an *""I wish I'd done this better...""* direction to see what she wishes she'd done differently. Get a feel from how about how she viewed that night and her reactions."
204,"You guys are *really* young to be considering marriage. It makes sense that she may just be figuring stuff like whether she wants kids or not out. This is one of the many reasons you shouldn't marry so young.

Unfortunately, kids are the ultimate dealbreaker. If you want them and she doesn't, the relationship is over."
205,"No, he clearly hasn’t tried to work on your marriage - he has lied multiple times to you, and constantly seeking attention from other women."
206,"The old ""I like you but think I can find someone better"". You know what to do."
207,"As others have said, don’t address past behavior. She’s asking if she can eat your food, &amp; you’re not explicitly saying no. You’re suggesting that you’d prefer her not to &amp; hoping she takes the hint. So if you decide you’re going to revisit past instances, all that’s going to do is derail the conversation you want to have (which is to stop doing this in the future) &amp; change it into a she said / she said of, “Well, you never told me I couldn’t have those cookies, so why are you bringing this up months later? What do you want me to do about it now?” She will feel trapped or ashamed &amp; will get defensive, &amp; you won’t even get to make the point you want to make, which is simply, “Please stop inviting yourself to my meals.”"
208,"If you've spent years internalizing messages that standing up for yourself is wrong or bad, well, you're going to feel bad when you finally do it. You can't reverse years of conditioning in one burst of effort, especially if you're also fighting the fear that there will be negative consequences for speaking up. 

That said, you did the right thing by not letting him trample all over you. You *were* brave, and I hope in time you can feel proud of yourself for it. "

You document everything. "
211,"I think it's super sweet because he was showing her that he really cared about her ENJOYMENT, not just his ego in giving her an orgasm. 

He doesn't mind if he doesn't make her come, he genuinely heard and cared about BOTH issues (she misses coming herself and is frustrated with the change, PLUS she's feeling stressed and pressued with that being the focus during sex). He honored both of those concerns separately (""here, let me make sure sex with me is as fun as it can be for you by taking off the pressue. Also since you do miss coming, let's upgrade your equipment so you can explore your new situation with minimal stress on your own terms.""

It was a very emotionally attentive and loving attitude to take - and he didnt' make it about himself and his ego vis a vis orgasms. wonderful outcome!"

In my state, a new driver can't even drive a non-family member in the first 12 months of having a driver's license.

At my university the biggest perk of the position is that their on-campus housing is paid for by the university. If he wants to get his PhD and do research, he is not limiting himself long-term in any way by passing up this position.

edit: I'd suggest he explore options in the labs, talking to his college advisors about research opportunities. "
222,She totally has been through your personal phone. There is no way someone would have such a reaction to a work phone when they haven’t even been in your personal one.
223,"hey, i've been with my husband for about that long. i find myself in your wife's shoes sometimes and so does my husband. here's the vicious cycle - if you're having sex, then it's easy to want more; if you're not, it's easy to just avoid it and sometimes the thought of it seems like ""too much work"". i've honestly thought about just ""scheduling"" it in daily before, though that isn't very romantic or ideal, because I notice once I have it I'm much more in the mood to do it again.

this is usually how i break the complacency cycle with my husband. i sit down and have a talk with him where i tell him, ""look, we've gotten lazy about sex and we need to work on that. it's neither of our faults, but let's just clear the air - no pressure on having it this second."" then one of us admits the idea has just not been appealing lately, gets that off his/her chest so that guilt/avoidance lifts a bit. i'll throw out ideas of things that are sexually related but not about sex themselves, such as - would he be interested in reading a book about sex together? (we've read erotic novels, and books like she comes first). how about listening to a podcast while we cook dinner? (lately we've been listening to guys we fucked, which is pretty funny). we'll bring up sex as a topic of conversation more often like, ""how do you feel about foreplay? what do you enjoy the most? any fantasies you've had lately? i read some tips on giving bjs that were interesting...is there anything you want me to try?"" talking about sex keeps it on the mind without putting pressure on having to do it this second. all of those ideas are alternatives for either of us when someone isn't in the mood but we don't want to stay like that forever.

for us, the key is 2 real things. 1) just starting to have it again and doing so with some regularity (both of us are on the same page about this momentum making all the difference) and 2) having frank and fun conversations about it, clearing the air, discussing what we like and things we want to try, without the pressure of that leading to sex.

And I think OP is normal and justified in her feelings and response.

Usually here at Reddit we are dealing with people that don't bother to communicate.  We don't know how to handle it when someone actually DOES communicate.

I actually have high hopes for your marriage.  

Go ahead with the counseling.  Make sure you stick with a counselor that helps you BOTH feel heard.  If you are not both feeling it with one therapist, try another.  Therapy is an art, not a science. Not every therapist is your Michaelangelo.

Honestly, this would be a great time to employ 3 therapists-yours, his and ours.  You don't need to hear how his emotional sausage is made and neither does he.   My parents did this about 20 years into their marriage.  It saved their marriage. They have been married 51 years.   The process wasn't pretty, but it worked.  I figure 6 months with all 3 and then tapering off.  It will not be free, but waaaaaaaaaay cheaper than divorce.

Even if you ultimately decide to separate, you  will be able to do it with clear hearts and minds-which is wsy better than broken and resentful."
235,Hello it’s me. Your long lost older sibling.
236,"This is tough. I can understand your mom's feelings being hurt if she tried to treat you in-laws like family and they paid her for their stay. But I can also see your in-laws side, especially if they don't come from a tax bracket where people just own beach houses. 

To resolve the immediate situation, my suggestion would be that your mom take the $500 and pick out a nice piece at a local art gallery to send to your in-laws. ""We had such a lovely time during your visit and we wanted you to have something to remember it by."" Your mom gets to feel like a gracious hostess and your in-laws hopefully get the point that they were treasured guests. Just make sure you remove all price tags. 

I think the long-term solution is figuring out a way for your in-laws to feel that they are expressing their appreciation without leaving cash. Had you mentioned your normal methods to them or was it not discussed? Maybe they could give the money to you and you can figure out a way to spend it on your parents?"
237,"Can I first just applaud you for your bravery and realistic view. 
Not a lot of people would realize the negative effects of an emotionally empty relationship and definitely not many who would willingly walk away because they know how poorly their partner is making them feel and that is not right. 
You’ll find someone who will look at you and only you in the near future. 

Until then, keep your head up! "

239,"To be honest, this update was a bit disappointing to read.

The comments in your last post overwhelmingly pointed out how very inappropriate any potential relationship would be - not just because of the 18-27 age gap, but also due to the nature of how you met.

And now you know your uncle was creepily trying to set you up with her, all the while convinced that he could “smooth over” the very clear impropriety.

And yet you still let her come over all the time. You still spend tons of time with her, and even took a one-on-one camping trip with her. You admit you still foster strong feelings of love (I’m assuming in a romantic sense) for her.

I’m glad you’re in therapy, but man...you really need to start establishing some *real boundaries* with this girl. She almost gave up on college to stay around you, and she’s clearly still head-over-heels for you.

You know this relationship is inappropriate. You say so in your post. But you’re still allowing the relationship to grow and move forward, and your mutual feelings for each other to keep getting stronger - even if you’ve convinced yourselves (and your uncle/her parents) otherwise.

I would suggest stopping the one-on-one trips. Give yourselves some real mental/emotional space. Start building some other, healthier connections with other people (romantic or otherwise). And let this relationship with Lily ease off into a *truly* platonic friendship."
240,It sounds like a tiff about the laundry is the least of your problems if 1) you think you're an idiot who makes life difficult for your husband and 2) he's comfortable sending you angry texts threatening to piss on your clothes.

Meanwhile get to making cool Christmas plans with your friends! "
246,"Y'all are putting wayyy too much emphasis on the Hallmark idea of romance. Yes, it's nice to have a storybook proposal, but ultimately it's not what matters in the grand scheme of things. 

If you haven't already, let him know you're sorry that you reacted that way in the moment. That it's not a reflection of how you feel about him in any way, and that you're so excited to get married to him.

And ideally he should apologise for either misunderstanding or ignoring your wishes (whichever it was). 

Seriously, try not to get too wrapped up in this stuff. Everyone has a few minor hiccups like that. Maybe they hate the ring, or something goes wrong at their wedding, or they fight on their honeymoon. Shit happens, and in a healthy relationship you just talk through it and learn to laugh about it with time."
247,You can try telling her you're on a food budget and are saving the leftovers for later. Or just scale down your recipes so you're only cooking enough for yourself/boyfriend.

Your GF is being selfish and uncompromising. That is not the foundation of a good relationship.

Clearly any indication that she gave in the past about a willingness to move was a lie.

You are too young to pass up on a career opportunity like this. If your relationship to her is strong, you can try LDR, but it will most likely fall apart, because she has no real interest in moving."
253,I think the fact that you're considering whether or not he created a situation to avoid helping you during a pretty emotionally and physically demanding time says that you don't trust him enough to continue pursing a relationship. 
254,"Do this! Screenshots can be edited but you can't just add a text on imessage. Ask the boyfriend to show the texts on his phone. 

Honestly, the bf sounds manipulative and emotionally abusive, from lying, stirring up dramas, to distancing your brother from someone he's close to. Clear this up and help your brother realize that"
255,"Holy fuck. No, you aren't being unreasonable. I had to triple check her age. She's incredibly selfish, and if that were me, Id break up with her. 

You're not going to get that money back. If you decide to stay with her, insist she pay you rent, get it in writing. Don't loan her money anymore. "
256,"Stress builds up. I think it's not abnormal at all. And let's face it some people deserve consequences. Nobody rational encourages street justice, but when it happens, sometimes the sentiment is ""couldn't have happened to a nicer guy"". People with life experience will understand that.

&gt; e said our views are too different and he feels like a totally different person around me compared to when he's with his family or friends. He's always had a problem with my being shy and introverted. He almost broke up with me toward the beginning of our relationship because of it

is a load of crap. He's trying to sell you these very vague ""flaws"" of yours (""living outwardly""? The fuck?), in order to avoid the very clear problem that he was taking your money for granted and using you as an ATM.

Don't let his BS get you down, and don't let anyone ever try to convince you that exploiting people or *blatantly trying to arrange an affair in front of them* is ""being an extrovert"". Jesus Christ, what an asshole."

261,"That was 100% inappropriate for your friend to have done that. You aren't a minor and she's not your mom. She has no authority to gatekeep you. Lots of possibilities here, these are some that I thought of:

1. She wanted to bang/date this guy herself and absolutely didn't want you to have him.

2. She's a control freak on a power trip who doesn't want you dating anyone because she's decided you aren't ready, or these guys aren't the ones she's ""chosen"" for you.

3. She's worried you'll abandon her if you begin a relationship with someone else and is jealous in that sense.

4. She is spiteful and doesn't want you to have something she doesn't (a relationship). There are some people who just don't want to see other people happy.

Talk to your friend. Try to get to the bottom of her behavior. Explain to her that it is NEVER ok to cock-block you like that. Ever. And keep your distance for awhile. It's 100% up to you if you decide the relationship isn't worth it and it's better to just be friendly acquaintances."
262,"This is really, really smart. I've been in the position of having my younger brother withheld from me by a spiteful parent, but I can't imagine having to navigate between two siblings. Good thinking to turn it around and use it their controlling behaviors as a safeguard."
263,"First off, congrats! I hope you have a wonderful day tomorrow and that your marriage is happy and all good stuffs.

However, if it were me, I wouldn’t talk to her. Chances are, a conversation would include lots of excuse-making that would just make you angry on your wedding day, which you don’t need. Those are horrible things to say to anyone, especially given that it wasn’t a very big deal in the first place.

The thing is, though, that it may start some additional drama if you cold-shoulder her. People like to forget that your wedding is not about them and the attention they receive. 

"
264,"Oof.

Firstly, good for you for coming out of a bad situation so well. That takes a determination that certainly not everyone has.

Have you talked with your boyfriend about these concerns? Has he indicated any nervousness on his part?

If he's the same guy that was good to you in your youth, he will certainly stand up for you to his family. If anyone makes any snide comments, he better be ready to stand with you in not accepting them.

For what its worth, his mother seems like a lovely woman, and while this may seem counterproductive at first, maybe it would be good to mention to this woman how nice it was for her to prepare backpacks for needy kids every year, and how much it helped you in your youth. Should make her feel good seeing a tangible effect her efforts had on someone.

As for the rest of the family, stay open minded but be ready in case someone says something off or insulting. Make sure if they only say things to you when your boyfriend is not in your general,vicinity, either address it calmly but assertively, or go straight to him and let him know his family is being inappropriate.

Good luck"
265,"I think in a way you got lucky.  This guy showed his true colors before you two got married or brought a baby into this world together.  

He sounds narcissistic in a sense, he was very manipulative and inflexible about your past.  He only wanted a woman within a certain set of parameters, but he was too much of a coward to be honest about it.

You will live many more decades, and you are beyond unhappy with this man. This will eat your soul - better to get out at 30 than 50.

273,I once casually dated a guy who didn't want me to come over to his place because he lived with his brother and he thought it would be awkward.

274,"You’re not crazy — you’re not wrong. I’m surprised he isn’t THANKFUL you’re extending the offer to stay at your place until this is sorted out. 

I’ve dealt with a mice infestation last year when moving back into my college owned apartment after winter break. Did the exterminators take a while to deal with it? Yes. Did I force my boyfriend to eat at my place and neglect sterilizing everything like a maniac? *Hell no.* I bleached every surface, put ALL food and eating utensils in the fridge to make sure no vermin would touch it, and even bought traps myself until the exterminator came. There are ways to be proactive about this situation before an exterminator even walks through the door if you give a shit, which he clearly doesn’t.  This is a health hazard, and if he refuses to deal with it and acknowledge your concerns, then yes I would see that as a dealbreaker for the relationship. 

Also, just and FYI, if you’re actually seeing mice and roaches frequently in commonly used places where humans usually visit, that’s a sign of a much larger infestation that has been neglected for a looong time. Hearing mice chewing wood and wires in the wall is one thing, but encountering them on counters and in cabinets either means they’re comfortable with human presence or competition is forcing them to be ballsy, or both.

He left you suddenly for an EIGHTEEN year old? Gross. Gross. Groooooossss. That won’t last long, don’t worry.

He didn’t have as much experience sexually and you’re a whore? Honey, he sounds like a complete psychopath. Who stays with someone for 3 yrs and leaves suddenly because your sexual experience bothered them?

You are much better off without him."
282,"&gt; so what should I do?

You remember that this relationship is 100% optional. He's a 28 year old slob (and horrific pet owner... 2 weeks without cleaning out/changing kitty litter?? That's straight up neglect) who has decided that he is totally okay with living in squalor and forcing you to do the same. He doesn't want to change, which is why he hasn't, yet.

Is this the type of person you really want to spend your life with?"
283,"ETA: alternative solution:

Text your brother or send him and bride a group email ""Hey, just wanted to let you know I passed along your message to [boyfriend] that you guys wouldn't need his help and decorations after all"". Pretend that you genuinely understood that this was your brother's wish. Insist that *he* is the one who told you to cancel the help and decorations: ""I am pretty sure you told me that on our last phone call, remember, you said you didn't want partners at all. Is that not what you meant? I thought you guys wanted the partners to attend as simple guests??"". Pretend you don't get it/genuinely misunderstood and ask clarification. 

It will be on him to explain that by ""no involvment *at all*"", he didn't mean ""no involvment *at all*"" but meant ""involvment in the chores but not the festivities"" and he will have to ask again for boyfriend's help while refusing to involve him, if he cares too. And if he does, you can simply say that this doesn't sound very fair/reasonable.

Then you two actually attend like simple guests. After the ceremony, I wouldn't attend any event during which boyfriend was snubbed, so we'd leave after the ceremony, when the VIPs go get their pics taken, or before dinner. If you don't want to create a scene, you can make up an excuse to the other guests so that only you, your boyfriend, bride-and-groom, and your parents know the truth/drama behind the curtain."
284,"He admitted to it and betrayed your trust; personally, I wouldn’t be able to be with someone like that long term. The fact that he got angry is also a huge red flag to me. "
285,"When he told you he was ""looking for a wife"" he was telling you you were auditioning, not that he was taking your relationship seriously. What an arrogant doof. He's also pressuring you to stay because he ""wants you"" but isn't interested in what you want (exclusivity). If it were me, I'd bail, because he obviously isn't ready for the kind of relationship you want if he's this selfish. "
286,"If it were my husband, I would want to know. Even if it ""breaks up the family"" I'd rather be divorced and co-parenting than married to a lying-ass selfish cheater.

288,"So....I reread your post after reading the critical first comment, and I disagree with that first comment. You sound hurt over years of feeling like your parents (esp your mother?) Love your sister more.

I know *exactly* how this feels. I won't go into my 'story' because this isn't about me, but I too have a little sister with whom my parents have an entirely different relationship and expectations. This hurts *so much*. 

That being said, I understand your hurt. I think it is legitimate hurt. I would ask: can you talk to your mother  (because I think letting it go will just foster further hurt and resentment) without bringing up all your other hurts regarding her relationship with your sister? I ask this because any time I have tried to approach my parents on this type of thing, they insist I am 'hanging onto the past' and they don't actually end up hearing what I am saying. 

Maybe write a letter. Explain how you would have liked the one you loved. It's done now, but I think expressing your feelings on the subject will help you move on from this. I am so sorry OP. This is tough. "

I'd also say you didn't take an opportunity away from someone else - you didn't do anything underhand, you didn't sabotage their efforts. *They chose to tell you about the program!* You got in because you were better than the other person - that's how life works. That coworker may have found out about the program from someone else himself!

And if he takes ""he forgot how to read"" as a literal complaint, it sounds like he doesn't have much of a sense of humour. You can have legitimate concerns about this guy *and* make a joke about it. All you can do is explain your point of view and not get into an argument about it - either he or you will decide you're too different, or you'll both find a happy medium. But don't feel like you have to endlessly defend yourself, and don't let him berate you for making different choices - he can express his opinion, sure, but everyone in life needs to learn when to leave things alone."

An adhd-er here, not suggesting your wife has it or anything but I understand the need to have something on top of just talking to people. There are a million focuses that make it hard to stay checked into a conversation.

While a phone may be a thing that she feels, has she ever tried just having anything else to fidget with that doesn't draw as much attention away from you.

Fidget toys.
Rubber bands.
Pens or pencils.
Paper clips.
A ring.
Etc.

Anything for her to have in her hands to occupy herself while on a date with you. Assuming she is open to this idea.

But as previous comments state she could be a phone addict and if that is the case, she may not be open to these suggestions and that is a different story.


Edit; you can't diagnose her with adhd from one symptom alone and there are plenty of other reasons why she could be like this, I was only trying to offer helpful solutions on the idea that this is a focus thing and not a need for a phone that works for me."

298,"It's not wrong of you to be upset or want to break it off. It sounds like he is wanting you to just be a different person from who you are. I'm also bothered that when you do make an effort, he doesn't even try to help conversation along or anything.  This really comes down to incompatible personalities. "
299,"You didn’t do anything wrong. He is being rude and childish. Personally, this kind of behavior would be an instant dealbreaker."
300,"If she had stayed, you both could have been hurt or died. She ran AND CALLED THE POLICE.

To be fair, we had 5 people living in the apartment and sharing the kitchen, so it was a bit more confusing and harder to let everyone know to their face. We ended up sticking those cheap circular stickers on the outside of the fridge and any food items dubbed ""shareable"" got a nice red or orange circle tacked on them. It was super duper helpful, and easy to do when putting away groceries since they were just hanging right there.

Your partner is a guy who tries to literally blackmail someone into dating him. Yuck.

I have a hard time imagining anyone is going to side with him on this one, and I agree with the other comment saying that heading him off at the pass is a good idea. Your family and friends like you for a reason (many reasons!) and I really hope that they would have a compassionate response to telling them ""I've just broken up with \[M\], and he is threatening to share something from my past in retaliation. I wanted to keep this private, but I know you would rather hear this from me than him; I had a DUI three years ago, and went through a program to reinstate my license.""

You mom couldn't hold the door open? Let her have that defective heater. Your wife can't stop spending? No more joint account, you will open a separate one for her that you will put money in monthly. Kid not being watched? Wife gets a job and 3 year old gets daycare. 

Stop running yourself ragged for people who know how to get what they want from you. They are willing to sacrifice your peace, money, hard work, time, job so *they can have more more more* without lifting a finger. 

I'm sorry about your dad. I hope you get enough time away from your family to properly grieve him. By enabling his wife to use you and manipulate you  you aren't honoring or taking care of her. I think he would be angry if he knew what they were doing to you."
320,You probably won't like my answer but this trip will be incredible friends or not. You will see and experience things many your age will not see in their lifetime. Your parents recognized this as a worthwhile investment for a lifetime learning experience go and live life. You may even make a few friends.
321,Be really pretty and BCC
322,"You think so too?

Another friend of mine also mentioned incompatibility but I can't tell if he's doing it on purpose or if he's just working off his newly-acquired knowledge

I'll think about this though, thank you"
323,Him saying he needed you to in order to trust you was 100% a manipulation tactic. I’m sorry. 
324,A friend has hit the NYT bestseller list several times over and she's started selling handmade jewelery and working odd jobs to make ends meet. I feel like so many people look at JK Rowling and assume the money just rolls in when you're published.
325,Also remove her name as someone who has permission to access your medical information. 
326,"Is your boyfriend from a small town? 

Cause 100% of that absolutely would get to my mom by the time I got home where I grew up.

Took a long time for the small town paranoia to fall away. Being chatty in public is definitely a perk I have come to enjoy living in a bigger city."
327,"Your wife is wrong. There is no way I would let a 16 year old drive my nice sports car around the block never mind to a school dance, you know what happens, they drink or he lets one of his idiot friends drive it and they get into an accident. Sure giving him the car for the dance would be ""nice"" but he has in no way demonstrated he deserves this kind of nice.

You actually offered him a reasonable compromise. You are going to have to live with the idea that your wife thinks you are unreasonable. I am curious, does she have this attitude about everything, that because your father is wealthy that her family should be able to have things because that might be a bigger problem to sort out."
328,"OP, I'm with you on this one. The statue is horribly racist, and cringe-worthy. I'd go as far as to not visit your mom &amp; step-dad at their home, and only see them away from the house."
329,"And by solve the relationship issue do you mean armchair diagnose the wife with ADD or an addiction based off one statement by the husband? Because that doesn't seem like it's going to solve anything. OP is asking the wrong question by asking why the wife feels the way she does. We can't explain his wife's behavior off of little to no actual information. I'm answering the better question of how to handle it, which is accomodate date nights around her tendencies so they can both have fun."
330,"Are her friends single, so your GF is essentially playing wingwoman for them to introduce them to groups of guys?  If so, as long as your GF is up front about being in a relationship, then I wouldn't worry about it at all."
331,"This is crazy.  And as other people have pointed out, you can mute someone.    

HOWEVER, you still have to deal with the fall out.  So I would write an email to SIL, cc brother and your mom on it (so there is no room for misrepresentation).  Say something like:  I checked my account and it does look like I accidentally deleted you.  I'm sorry for the misunderstanding it caused.  I'm not an avid Instagram user, social media is simply an occasional distraction for me.  I would hope that as my brother's wife any relationship between us would be more meaningful than a social media follow or like.  Best, OP.  PS I added you back again.
"
332,"You'll end up resenting your girlfriend anyway if you turn down the offer to appease her. And to be honest, you sound as if you've made your decision already. Pack your backs and go!!!"
333,"Honestly? You should have insisted he check into the hospital because it sounds like he really, *really* needs it."
334,"You're not obligated to let anyone drive your car. And I think not letting her at it is a good move considering her history.

Just a side note but your gf sounds like a mess. Her car just got repo-ed and she's been in multiple wrecks at the age of 27? You sure she's the one for you?"
335,"I remember reading your post before and I’m glad the situation worked out well for you both! You seem like a level headed girl with good intentions, I wish you all the best!"
336,[removed]
337,tell your landlady your parents are away taking care of a very sick relative and maybe you can have one of your friends or your boyfriend pretend to be your mom or dad over the phone. 
338,"Call CPS. 

Yes, I am telling you to call CPS on your own family, to save yourself. Tell them you're being held against your will and not allowed to leave. Get the fuck out of there. 

Find a women's shelter, join the military, anything, ANYTHING."
339,"No matter how strict you are with your dogs, you're never going to train them to not trip over cables that are in their only way though the house. That's just unreasonable. I understand your husband is upset about his computer, but if he actually wants these dogs to behave, he first needs to set realistic expectations for their behaviour. Then actually train them, using proper techniques. Setting arbitrary rules for your dogs, and then getting angry at them when they break them, is stupid, cruel and ineffective."
340,"Shouldnt you be proud y'kno, cause she is yours and if she is faithful then she is only yours and no guy could be with her? That kind of pride of ""you can check her out all you want but she is with me"" "
341,just block all avenues of contact. she deserves nothing and will only look to stir up drama if you give the slightest inch.
342,"""Who is X??"" ""How do you know X??"" I mean, no matter what his first language is, he knows your name and knows who you are."
343,"It sounds like the problem isn't her- she sounds supportive and lovely. It sounds like the problem is these men. Why not try to hang out with her in situations that don't involve dating or flirting, like getting coffee, going on a run, movies, hanging at home, etc?"
344,Yeah I think you’re right
345,"From what I've heard, this is a very painful procedure. If you aren't interested in doing it for yourself, I don't think this is a reasonable ask to request of a partner. 

Just like I wouldn't think it was reasonable for you to ask her to get a boob job.

It's not a great sign for your marriage that she's trying to dramatically change your appearance three months in. I'm surprised she didn't push on this for wedding photos if she cared so much about it."
346,[removed]
347,"Honestly - I wouldn't approach it that ""hardcore"".

Tell her you feel that need more time for yourself and you are not ready for something romantic,  suggest you stay friends - then go out for a drink with maybe a couple of friends - him included and see where this is going naturally without forcing.

Telling her ""I am not ready but I know someone"" sounds a bit like ... I don't want you but maybe you like the second choice.

I have coupled a bunch of friends including one pair wich is (still) happily married when I was in school and a couple others who turned out into LTR :)"
348,"Me too. 

Another thing I didn't mention was that big tests stress him out a lot. He grew up poor in the midwest but was extremely smart and talented. He only had one chance to take the SAT because his family could only afford for him to take it once and they had to drive over 200 miles to the nearest testing location for him to take it. He studied so so much because he knew how important it would be to his future. Ended up getting a perfect score and went to Yale. 

So I guess you could say (and he's admitted it too) that he doesn't like big tests and they stress him out to no end. Of course now he can afford to take the MCAT as many times as he wants but he still doesn't want to. It's the history and the lasting impression it left I think. 

I know it seems like he handled studying very poorly and doesn't have his shit together but hopefully this gives at least a little bit of insight. He told me about his testing anxiety because of the SAT just recently. He usually handles other sources of stress really well. "
349,"Winner, winner, chicken fucking dinner. Came here to say the same thing. This guy doesn't go for girls who speak up for themselves. Take your red flag, cut it into a sexy swimsuit, and swim back in the with other fishes. Thank yourself for being assertive! "
350,"You can be very grateful for the gift, **and still want the money she owes you**. She owed you £120. She didn't owe you a coffee machine, you didn't ask for a coffee machine, you didn't want a coffee machine. Tell her to keep the coffee machine, but you need the £120 she owes you. Returning it is her problem. Just because she made an impulsive and stupid decision, doesn't magically mean that she doesn't owe you money any more. Because a gift is just that - a **gift**. That's not repaying a debt. If she's trying to ""repay you"" with something you don't want AND get credit for buying you a gift **using the money she owes you**, she's being underhanded and unhelpful at the same time.

If I owe my friend £20 and buy him a birthday present costing £20, especially if it's something he didn't want, I don't then get to say ""that's me repaying you, and by the way aren't I lovely for buying you a gift""! *At best* it's one or the other, not both.

You're not a spoiled brat, your mother is an asshole. If nothing else learn from this and always get money from her upfront for anything similar in future. When someone shows you who they are, believe them."
351,"I’m sorry, but it sounds like she never really intended to leave the city you’re in. 

I think you need to sit her down and ask her what she wants to do. Does she want you to turn down the opportunity? Does she want to break up? Does she want you to move and try long distance? Does she just need some time to adjust to the thought and will be ready to talk in a few weeks?

My gut is saying that this relationship can’t work. You’ve made the sacrifice of staying in this city for her, and she is unwilling to move to a new city for you, even for this great opportunity you have. I think that’s valid—if she doesn’t want to move, she shouldn’t have to move—but what’s upsetting is that she always indicated she was open to moving when she’s clearly not."
352,"Yeah, you and your boyfriend don’t sound compatible. He’s telling you that he thinks you’re unethical for your choices: it’s not like you can explain yourself and make him change his mind. In fact, you’ve tried to explain yourself and he digs in deeper."
353,"There are some men who think that women use tears to get what they want. They think that *all* women do this. And it’s at least partially rooted in their *own* strong reaction to seeing a woman cry - it makes them feel bad, which makes them feel out of control of their emotions, which makes them angry at YOU for “making” them react that way, you must be doing it on purpose!!

It’s bullshit. "
354,"It sounds like this situation goes beyond just a phobia of being unemployed. He is more than willing to  uproot his entire life (and OP as well) for multiple cross-country moves whenever he is unhappy, but only on his terms. He continually prioritizes his own happiness and security over all else; that attitude makes for a pretty crappy partner."
355,"He's 16, I'd say if they haven't got him yet, he's immune. 


16 year olds have a healthy scepticism about what their parents say"
356,"Call off the wedding. Give her some time to figure out what she wants. If it's not you, then you're saving a lot of time and effort. If it's you, then she won't be hung up on this guy forever. You should be her first choice, not her second, third, fourth, millionth, etc. – especially if you're getting married.

Either way, that situation is tough. Good luck."
357,Showered *with soap and shampoo*
358,Cocaine's a helluva drug
359,"\&gt;FIL says he has no idea what we're talking about. He never agreed to give us the money for a house. That was for a wedding. Since we got married at the courthouse, we don't get wedding money. He claims the restaurant conversation never happened.

You didn't include your FIL's age or any background on his mental health. Has he been forgetting things lately? Are there other conversations or things happening in the background that may seem ""off""? Sorry, edit: FIL's age. "
360,"Your boyfriend sounds like a lovely, supportive person."
361,Oh yeah either way we're going to do that. Even right now her bank account statements and other mail come to my place. 
362,"Liking other girls half naked photos is a boundary I have in my relationship. I do not put up with it. I understand other women are cool with this. That's fine. I understand other men think they are entitled to this- they need to find other women. 

Liking other girls half naked photos while asking you not to post half naked photos is the biggest fight I have ever had with my husband. 

BUT, 

Liking other girls posts, telling you not to post stuff like that, and then not even liking your posts? That's insane. I'd post a half naked photo and tag him. Then I would dump him. "
363,"At 24 lack of contact is usual. At 14 it is absolutely not. It's just shitty parenting. Unfortunately you're facing a known phenomenon where the second marriages become the true ones while people desperately try to forget the first one including the kiddie baggage with it. A lot of kids from the first marriages feel this way when they're sidelined for the second one. The fact that she doesn't include you in social media and interviews is because she can't. She does not have day to day contact with and can't make a fake relationship with you out of thin air. Besides teenage mom is not part of her narrative either. 

Unfollow her and hide her posts from all social media. You're wasting your time trying to keep up with her over there. You're only punishing yoursef over a fake cultivated image of her. I know you want to know your mom but this is not the way to do it. 

Secondly, start with your birthday. Do tell her you're hurt by how much she claims to be family oriented but can't be bothered to be part of yours. Her reaction will be what you need to look out for. If she tells you you're wrong and things get ugly then you know reshashing it isn't worth it. Keep the relationship with your sister and the rest can go hang. "
364,This is what he does when he's in your mother's home. Imagine what he does when you two have your own place. Now that's scary...
365,"&gt; She's been looking for better jobs for quite a while, but there really is almost nothing out there that utilizes JUST a bachelors of psychology. 

She won't find anything that utilizes just a bachelors of psychology, pretty much anywhere.  

What she will find is something that uses a ""bachelors degree"" with high GPA and a good work history.  

She needs to broaden her search.  If she wants to work in psychology directly, she needs to go back to school; if she wants to get into marketing, HR, or other things, she can work on getting into those roles with her current education.  

Especially in Dallas - a pretty big city - she should be able to find a corporate role that will value her more qualitative skills.  "
366,"&gt;  I don't want to ruin their relationship

she did, you are simply informing a poor guy whos being used by a shitty person."
367,If you leave the relationship is not wasted. You had good times.  They're not a waste. Starting again is not a waste. This is simple. Your standards are no longer the same. She can explore her sexuality and you can move onwards and upwards.
368,he is amazing and thank you! 
369,You should stop calling this asshole your friend. 
370,"If I were you - just my opinion, not an advice - I would give him my Apple ID and password, and tell him to look up any text messages he wants. You can always change your password later. Ask your brother if his boyfriend will offer your brother his Apple ID and password. I doubt he will."
371,What does this tell you about him and how he sees you?
372,“Who’s Jake? I don’t think you’ve mentioned a Jake before” 
373,"Its hard sometimes to walk away from a first love, especially considering he was ready to tie the knot. Given, he SHOULD have stayed far away, considering her cheating (btw, was he tested for stds?if not he needs to). Try to be sensitive to the fact that he was weak, and he went back to the first person he ever loved, even if she is a terrible person. You dont have to support his decision, or hang out with fer, but as he is your close friend, I wouldnt nuke the friendship over his poorly made decision. Inevitably, this cycle will repeat: She will cheat again, the relationship end. Hopefully the second time will be the charm and he will walk away forever. 

In the meantime, tell him you want to hang out with him still, but you dont want to hang out when shes around. Try something along the lines of, ""Hey man, Im happy for you for getting back together with someone you can about, but after what she did to you repeatedly, I cant resume anything resembling a frienship with her. I know you want us all to hang out together, but i would prefer if you hang out with her on your own, and we hang out separate."" 

It may also help if you make sure all of the other people in your friend group are on the same page as you about the hanging out part, so theres unity in this decision, and it doesnt sound like your just being the difficult guy of the group."
374,"I love this. My husband never had to give me an ultimatum- we had a baby and I realized that I HAD to overcome it. I had PTSD from two bad accidents and could never drive. He got me a car (I picked it out which gave me a sense of ownership) and I went to therapy as well. He taught me to drive and not be afraid anymore, and finally I was able to do it. I still get happy whenever I get behind the wheel and it's been 4 years! 

Congrats to your girlfriend, and props to you for not abandoning her and supporting her even though it had to be hard for you. You're a great boyfriend!"
375,"I want to clarify, you absolutely CAN be angry. You can feel however you feel, please don't judge your own feelings. Anybody would be overwhelmed by this and there's no ""right"" way to feel.

I think couples counseling is a really good idea - it may not have helped with your ex, but that's because he was already a cheater. Your husband is not and obviously wants to work through these feelings, so if you are able to see staying together, I think you should give him the opportunity to do that. It will also allow you to express yourself openly about all of this in a safe space with a trained mediator instead of letting it fester inside you silently."
376,"Yeah, break up with him. Seems like he’s preying on younger women he can control. "
377,"If your vagina isn't as dry as the Sahara by the point he sends you a pic of himself fake crying to get what he wants, surely that reason would destroy any possible attraction.

Personally I'm sure mine would detach if I was told that to my face. "
378,"Yes you should dump him. 

I’m an exotic dancer, so I can say whole heartedly nothing would have happened, she was just hustling for his money. 

However he lied and his behaviour was completely unacceptable. I am super liberal about stuff like this, my boyfriend is welcome to go to strip clubs with friends on like a night out or when he’s on a trip and get a dance or two, that’s fine, what would not be fine is him contacting the stripper in any other way. It would be unacceptable. 

I would leave him. This isn’t a little white lie this is him clearly disrespecting you and searching for something outside of his relationship. Why does he need to be in contact with her? Why’s he trying to talk to her? 

You know what to do girl. "
379,This is the correct response. Tell your dad he knows how she treated OP and her sister and that he still expects them to be at her beck and call is frankly pathetic and reflects badly on him as a parent. 
380,"Yes. This. Every. Single. Time.

I did this when my neighbours kept climbing onto my roof (I've got a skylight above my bed and they'd go up there to do coke at 4am and I'm a very tiny woman living alone).

Anyways, after they finally got evicted, I decided to ask my co-worker's husband (Police Chief) if he could get a record of how many times I called them.

47 times. 

Fourty Seven Fucking Times.

They came every single time. 

For the longest time I was worried I was wasting the police resources, but he reassured me that they could be dangerous to others (IE: me) and not to feel bad about it. 

Anyways, my calls finally gave the landlord enough to evict them (amoung other things).

They said they'd rather get the call than never get it and something bad happens. "
381,"A couples counselor can help you have the conversation. He's being very unfair, expecting you to shoulder the entire burden of unemployment and financial dependency. You are supposed to be a team, meaning you share risk.

Btw, is it possible that the reason he's not happy is him, not the big city?"
382,"Yeah, I agree.  I doubt this was the fiancee purposefully leading OP on - I'm willing to bet she didn't really know what she wanted or thought she would change her mind as she got older.  16 is super young to be certain about having a child.  Even early 20s is super young."
383,"Sounds like she also has a history of poor money management, considering it got repossessed. You on the other hand sound like a solid budgeter and know how to pay things on time. Sure you guys are compatible?

As for your question, no, she should not be driving your car. Youve been dating 8 months. Youre not married. And she has a history of poor driving skills. "
384,"Wow, she has no shame. I can't imagine inviting myself to a couple's Valentines Day dinner date. I'm mortified on her behalf. "
385,"I mean, I can see how at first it might seem weird that a second phone pops out of nowhere. But if you break it down: 1) you pulled the phone out right in front of her, so it's pretty darn unlikely that it's some burner phone for cheating on her. 2) you showed her as much as you could to prove it's a work phone and even directed her to the number on the website, which is 100% solid proof in my opinion. 3) you said she already knows you can't tell her about your clients, so it makes total sense that you would have a phone solely for this purpose – cuts out a lot of potential accidents or slip-ups (for example, going out drinking with buddies and your phone gets lost).  


Does she go through your regular phone? If she's actually pissed off about this second phone and won't let it go, I'd be out of there. You've given her every reason to NOT be suspicious, so for her to just ignore facts and decide her own truth.. That's a red flag if I ever saw one."
386,"&gt; She still didn’t get it and said “Hmm, I’m sensing some hesitation, is there a problem?”

How did you respond? Because this situation was so clear-cut. You were making dinner for *you and your boyfriend.* You didn't want your date crashed by the moocher. Please tell me that you didn't let her scarf down the fancy seafood you made for your partner.

You're going to have to learn to start saying ""no"" and worrying less about being nice. *She's* not concerned about being nice, she just wants your food."
387,"Hey there! I've had a couple of rugs pulled underneath me as well, so I get how you feel. You are 100% entitled to feel upset and disgusted by your friend's behavior. However, you are also 100% entitled to ask for space to process your feelings. It's hard to gain perspective on something if you're right in the thick of it. There is no need to make a decision about the future of this relationship right now.

My advice is to be straight with him. Tell him how you feel and that you need some time and space to sort out how you feel about this. You can tell him that you still care about him, but need time to process. You are not obligated to be his therapist. If you are afraid he may hurt himself, send him whichever helpline is relevant to your area or call in a welfare check (if the situation is more dire)."
388,On the bright side your best friend is awesome! You are lucky to have someone so loyal.
389,Unless he is overly sensitive to his diagnosis I dont see why he would be offended. Just explain that you are losing sleep and the exhaustion is getting to you. 
390,"Your mother is not only abusive; I suspect she is also mentally ill.

You do not have to expose yourself to abuse. You are not required to subject yourself to that sort of treatment. Set your boundaries and be clear with them. You can feel sympathy for her and mourn her while still protecting yourself. "
391,"I don't understand the amount of chiding you're getting here. Your boyfriend is a moronic child and he deserved the tongue-lashing you gave him. If you don't get a sincere unprompted apology from him that includes offers of payment for a repair, I'd bounce and look for someone more considerate and mature. "
392,"Right, I find that similar to people who say they ""want a break"" rather than just breaking up. A legal separation is a slippery slope, and it doesn't seem honest of him to state that he doesn't want a divorce if he's that willing to go this far. "
393,"Only 2 things will help fix this. You keeping clean and time. If you keep clean and respect her wishes, Im sure over time you'll be more involved. Shitty situation "
394,"&gt;When he gets angry he yells and one time even called me an asshole (he said I was being an asshole and he was just expressing his true feelings but I don’t think it’s right to call people names, even when you are angry.) 

This is not only a double standard, it's straight up abusive. It sounds like he's trying to control you like an abusive partner would. If he slowly trains you that you have no right to your own emotions, and only he gets to express them, then he can better control the relationship, and thus you, over time. 

Tell him that he never gets to question your tears again and ALSO he doesn't get to be abusive and yell again. If either behavior come up, you should leave. Because there are already plenty of red flags flying."
395,"If you want to learn to be okay with what has happened, find a therapist.

If you’re not sure if you want to learn to be okay, find a therapist.

If you don’t want to, get a divorce.

All of these are valid and reasonable."
396,"Just send your mom this post! Seriously, this is so sweet!

Anyone would be appreciative of the nice things you've said here about her appearance, but she will be beyond touched by the thoughtfulness and love you so clearly articulate in your reasons for wanting to say them. It's beautiful, OP. Any mother would be in tears, and feel both incredibly fortunate to have you as a daughter and just as proud to have raised someone so kind. "
397,"&gt;Apparently, it doesn’t work if he tries to shower immediately after waking up in the morning, midday, or anytime long before he plans to sleep. He just absolutely cannot fall asleep. 

Good lord, he should have gone straight to a psychiatrist to get his sleep problem figured out after you lovingly and kindly swallowed that load of bullshit."
398,"Can I ask why you want to work it out? He sounds like he doesn't respect this marriage at all, and quite frankly you deserve a partner that isn't so immature."
399,"Because it's the way to handle things without any problems and to make sure you're fully informed of everything that entails during a divorce. Don't think of having a lawyer as a nuclear decision, think of using it as going in with a fully informed plan."

403,“I know you are still talking to your ex. This isn’t the first time you have lied to me about it. We are done. I wish you luck with her.” Then drop it and cut him off.

404,"&gt; Vivian knows what she's done as it was explained to her when she was sober but she just said it's embarrassing for her and she wishes making out wasn't cheating. 

This has all the makings of her making out, sucking off, or fucking a male stripper at her bachelorette party if James proposes.  You're right that he deserves to know the truth, especially since Vivian lied by omission about her previous actions.  But without any kind of actual proof, unless all the people who were there agree to tell the same story, this could end up being matter of she-said vs. she-said."
405,"This same thing happened to my mom’s best friend, and it turns out he was already cheating. He suggested an open relationship as a way to softened her up to the idea. OP, I think you should be open to the possibility that he may have already done the deed and was using this as a way to gauge your reaction."
406,"It sounds like at this point he just doesn’t want to have to deal with the stress of having someone who he has had conflict with around at a place meant to relax, which I can’t blame him for. Were they both wrong for fighting about the vacation while drunk? Yes. But clearly for her it continues to be an issue for her that she isn’t invited. 

Here’s the thing. Just because she’s your girlfriend doesn’t mean she’s entitled to tag along to any vacation, especially when it’s at your friends parents house. If I were in her shoes, where he drunkenly invites me then soberly admitted it was a mistake, I would have shrugged it off and said “you know, I completely understand. after all, it’s his parents place, and you guys deserve to hang out with friends without me tagging along”. Instead, she made snide comments, leading to drunken fights, which she is now talking about with others, insinuating you have to pick her over your friend. 

You need to talk to her about this. It’s a problematic mindset. "
407,I would be calling any adult you could trust. An aunt or uncle? Or the parent of a friend and ask for help. It’s not acceptable to be isolated like this without reason. Get any adult you can to get onto your parents and tell them to sort this shit out.

410,Yeah it can be scary to open up and tell your SO your deepest insecurities but it can and most often will really take a relationship to the next level.
411,"&gt;He just said, “It looks bad,” and hasn’t said anything since.  He knows that I know and now he’s just trying to figure out a way to explain the photos.

Yep, he is struggling to come up with a believable lie.  

&gt;I’m not sure what he expects me to think, but in my mind he either cheated on me or got really close to cheating on me.

I feel like him lying to you first and then trickle-truthing you now make it obvious he knew what he did was wrong.  

You'll have to decide how you feel about this.  If his friends wanted to drink and he just got caught up in conversation with this girl, are you willing to forgive him for the lie and try to work things out?   I assume that if he went further than conversation with this girl that you would be out due to cheating, right?  Or are you thinking you would forgive him if he was honest about the cheating and wanted to work it out with you?"
412,"This seems extremely harsh! If Tom had written this post he would have said 'I'm dating this great girl but I feel like she's habitually dishonest' and people would be taking his side, someone would say 'she's gonna cheat on you dude' or something with no evidence of that at all. Just as you're implying he's an abuser because he doesn't like lying. I don't think either of these people sound bad, just unfitted for one another."
413,"I'll bet you a suit that as soon as he says ""let's do separate accounts"" she caves instantly. "
414,You don't do anything. It's between her and step dad.
415,[deleted]
416,"&gt; but she had been leading me on for the whole length of our relationship 

Yep, between her being 16 to 21, which means during a 1/4 of her life, which is a huge part of the body development, and of the personality too.

She didn't leaded you, she just changed.

"
417,Yea.  If your friend is Betsy Bestfriend then he probably texted her when he meant to text Betsy Hookupgirl.
418,[deleted]
419,"^ Yep, exactly this. She is not over her ex, and she is not ready for a new relationship (or a marriage!). To be honest, I think she does not love you. Perhaps she thinks she does, but no. If she really would love you, she would forget about her ex. You are more like a placeholder, and she mentioned to leave you (even if she diesn’t say that to your face) when her ex blinks with an eye. 

You deserve better than this. You deserve someone who loves you, don’t use you as a placeholder, respect your feelings (don’t hurt you or gives you the feeling of being worth less), and to be ready for a new relationship. 

Do yourself a favour and call off the marriage. She won’t stop adoring her ex when you two are married, and in the long run, you won’t be happy with her or the marriage. "
420,"You're gonna be getting divorced. You can do it now or later, whatever is more convenient.  

Go ahead and start planning and talk to a lawyer."
421,"He did cut all contact.  But it doesn't matter. I didn't think anything would happen with her (I just didn't -- she knows all about me, and from Facebook I also know he's not at all her type, plus she's newly dating another guy who IS her type).  I'm not worried about her or them starting an affair.  I'm more angry thinking I can't trust him, can't trust his judgement and he makes stupid decisions."
422,"He's autistic so you're gonna have to be blunt. ""Dude you can't come in my house until you shower with actual soap and put clean washed clothes on"" if he doesn't listen at least you won't have to febreeze the sofa again"
423,The imaginary break is my personal favorite 🙃
424,"Right? They're unemployed, so it's not like they're busy. They're living with her, so it's not like it's inconvenient. They should absolutely be the ones to help out."
425,"6 weeks, early 20s, immature selfish boyfriend: next!"
426,"Actually it's normal to be more sexually attracted to someone with whom you grown emotionally close.   That's the reason most emotional affairs end up going sexual eventually.  The participants always swear that nothing could happen because ""she/he's not my type physically"" yet at some point that doesn't matter.

You're in your twenties and think of attraction in terms of physical attributes.  Look around at people you know with successful long-term marriages (as in 20+ years) and think about how many of them are objectively physically attractive and whether they ever were really.  Emotional intimacy is what sustains the relationship and in the end, it's much more powerful than everyday lust.

Don't tell your friend about your feelings; unless you want to act on them, it would be teasing.  Just continue as friends.  Either your feelings will fade, or they will become compelling enough for you to act on them. "

428,"Call CPS.

Also see if you can call his mother in that other state.

Additionally if you can, have a chat with your co-worker about what his plans are when he turns 18.  He should have an escape plan in place for leaving and never going back."
429,"I think you need to have a discussion with him.

First, let's try to get to his mindset. It makes him nervous; his reputation and impression is at stake here. He has a much younger girlfriend who always has bruises on her. Even if her coworkers know, strangers might judge him and think she is in trouble. 

If someone from his work sees all the bruises on his girlfriend, or his boss sees it, he could be in big trouble. Because, even if her coworkers believe her, his coworkers might not believe him (people are inclined not to believe an abuser who says they're not abusing). 

Okay, so he is in kind of a pinch. It makes sense that he doesn't want people to see them. But he also has no right over your clothing choices. Sit down and have a talk with him. Call him out on it that he's afraid of the judgement of strangers. That he needs to be okay with what you wear and that the opinions of strangers are not important. But also, you need to step up to make him feel comfortable too. If people enquire, tell them what you do. Mention it in conversation with new people before they get concerned and judge him with no basis. Let everyone know that you're proud of your fighting injuries. And let him know that he can be proud of his super talented girlfriend, too. That it's okay to show off your bruises; they just show off how awesome you are. "
430,"Would it be possible for you to attend Thanksgiving with your family without him?  I mean, you two are engaged, you're not attached at the hip.  The type of rigidity that your fiance is displaying in this situation is a little concerning too.  Life isn't always fair and circumstances should dictate decisions sometimes, regardless of what's ""fair."""
431,"I wrote out a lot of analysis, but then decided it was pretentious and deleted it.

1) It's not your property, so ultimately, legally, you can't do anything.

2) You've made your case. They doubled down. Logic wouldn't appear to work.

My advice to you would be that for every gift-giving occasion, be it birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Labor Day, whatever... I would send them a card, and include the receipt for the donation you made in their name to the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund, or the local black historical/heritage society...you know, since history is so important to him.

You're not going to wear them down, so go with the semi-regular notification that he's being an ass, and maybe the thank you letters from the assorted charities will eventually make him feel like enough of a doofus to take an appropriate action on his own."
432,"I really don't see how you did anything bad here.. if anything, you did the current gf wrong by inviting your ex. That would probably make me uncomfortable if my BF invited his ex to sleep over. But you're the one that tried to save the relationship with your ex. It seems she doesn't want to see you move on and is showing a lot of jealousy. That's her problem and her loss because she didn't want to keep trying in the relationship. You have done nothing wrong and you are far from an asshole/monster!!"
433,"Sadly, I think your parents are being a little dramatic here.  If this were truly an issue with them, your mom. could simply call in-laws, thank them for their generosity, then tell her that this is absolutely not needed in the future and that she considers them family and they are welcome any time. That would ease the situation intead of just passive aggressively returning the money.  I don't know your parents, though- perhaps this is their normal MO? "
434,"So, he

 * Waited until the *very* last minute to get ready. Not even the night before, but the very moment you should have been walking out the door.

* Gave entirely incorrect information about how ready he was. He should have said, ""I'm not ready, go on without me,"" but instead kept saying he was almost ready. 

* Is refusing to take responsibility for how his lack of organisation impacted you. 

* Is acting like he never wanted to go on this trip on the first place, and was only going as a favour to you.

So he's selfish, inconsiderate, unreliable, wholly incapable of achieving sometime as basic as getting himself ready on time, and refusing to take any responsibility for what he's done. 

What do you do? You dump him.

"
435,"Ok the lube one is just hilarious...

But he sounds really uptight and... repressed? Like I'm from a super WASPy family, and we just don't talk about a lot of things, but thats usually money/income/mentalhealth issues. We're all over gossip about creeps and lecherous teachers... LOL

Is he very image conscious? Like overly concerned what other people think of him?"
436,"If he can take the time to like other women’s pictures, but scrolls past yours...that wouldn’t be okay with me. It may not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but I mean, what are his reasons for not supporting you? And he knows that you can see the posts he likes, which obviously doesn’t really concern him. It shows a lack of respect and appreciation on his end. You’re not overreacting. I would talk to him about it if it really bothers you. He should be understanding "
437,"&gt; he is not sure that he wants those things with me. 

He is sure. He doesn't want those things with you.

&gt; He then says that I'm pressuring him and that this is my age speaking,that I'm showing signs of desperation and what is important is that we love each other and we should live in the moment. He says that he doesn't know what i want from him and why it is so important to me to feel secure. 

These are really fucking cruel things to say to your GF of 2 years. I'm really sorry. Feeling secure in relationship is like a first priority need. It's not rocket surgery. Humans crave love and belonging. Nothing you are doing is wrong here. He just doesn't want the same things as you. Take him at his word and move on.

His looks and living in the moment right now are not as important as what you want for your life."
438,"&gt;  She also does NOT want me to have a journal that's for my eyes only. If I have a journal she needs to have access to it. I've even tried writing locked notes on my phone. SHe'll find them and demand that I do nothing else until I unlock them and let her read what's inside.

Why are you with this person?

Keep the therapist appointment, lose the girlfriend."
439,"Don’t you dare cancel that order. You mentioned that your wife consistently spends a significant portion of the pooled money on things for herself. Pull up the last three months’ worth of statements and show her what she has spent compared to what you’ve spent, and if she has half a brain she will back off."
440,Trying on a bikini? Yeah right. She cheated.
441,"You aren’t your boyfriend’s mom. 

I say that with sympathy for you OP. You made your desire to be included known, and then it was up to him. Maybe a reminder here and there, but if you feel like you need to go around telling him what he’s doing wrong and telling him what to do differently the relationship is doomed. If someone puts their hands on you drunk or not, you don’t keep following them around telling them what to do. If you think they are a danger to themselves or others you gather up some of his friends to take him away from the party, or call the police, or something. If it were me in that situation I would go up to his closest friend, tell them what was going on, put them in charge, and leave. If my boyfriend was literally running away from me repeatedly without putting his hands on me, I would make sure he had a way home and then would also leave. Because you don’t have control over the behaviour of others, only your own. "
442,"Given your post history, you're in a relationship with an emotionally abusive man who abandons you four nights a week to spend time with his non-biological daughter, whose much older mother has been shaking your BF down for money and babysitting for decades in an extremely abusive, questionable way (he was 19 when she started preying on him at 36).

The entire situation is broken and dysfunctional. This is just the latest instance of it."
443,"When someone shows you who they are believe them. No one should pressure you into having sex. That's not love, it's control. Knowing the difference is so important."
444,"This is tricky because it sounds like there's way more to this story than what you're telling. I'd be interested in getting more examples of what your girlfriend has experienced/her perspective because the way I read this, there's either two options:

- your parents have been far more unpleasant to your girlfriend than you realise and your judgement is clouded because of your relationship and history with them

- your parents might not be the most welcoming but your girlfriend is reading into things and is stirring the pot 

Either way, what it comes down to is that everyone seems to be fighting over you and you are being made to decide between them. On the one hand, it sounds like you and your parents will never see eye-to-eye anyway due to your differing beliefs but on the other I'm also concerned when you say ""she has a way of yelling and convincing me that her behaviour was justified"". That doesn't sound healthy to me. Does this happen often? Is she controlling in any other way?

Be selfish and try to decide what is best for you and only you. "
445,"The cruise was a reward for weight loss. She didn't lose the weight. She doesn't get to go. 

It sucks when people change and you feel left behind. I feel bad for your sister, but she made this choice. Perhaps you guys can all reach out to her with love and let her know that you still care about her and want to spend time with her when you're back from this trip, so she doesn't feel quite so excluded. "
446,"Hang on, he went to the hospital and threatened to have himself committed, but then when that wasn't an effective tool to get what he wanted, he abandoned his plan and came home. Am I reading that right? That is honestly one of the most manipulative things I have ever heard. This isn't about him acknowledging the context. It's about him creating hugely dramatic situations when he doesn't get his way, and trying to manipulate you by any means necessary. 

What exactly is he doing to work on his mental health? It's bullshit to give him leeway because of anxiety. Having a mental illness doesn't give you the right to abuse people. I've got anxiety, depression, and PTSD, and I sure as fuck don't scream at my husband and threaten to have myself committed. "
447,Lawyer up tomorrow. There's no way this doesn't end in a custody battle.
448,"I wouldn't give him the chance to lie. I am totally against baiting people to see if they will be truthful.

"
449,"I don't really think someone who was this big of a piece of shit to another person can somehow be changed. It sounds like he set you up to be raped, and your sister knew about this. Maybe you should unpack this with a therapist. I wouldn't go to the lunch, I don't see what it's supposed to accomplish, I can't imagine there's anything he could say that will make you feel at peace with this. Does your family know about his bullying and that this is who your sister is with? I would sit down and really think about what kind of relationship you want with these two going forward."
450,"&gt; I guess my question is, what's my role in all of this?

&gt; I've always just taken the side of supporting DH and his decision not to have contact with his dad or his family.

You answered your own question. That's exactly what you should have done and what you should continue to do. No further questions or overthinking needed. "

452,"Been there girl and hopefully you can move past this and keep your friend :)

Men would always go to my best friend (the wholesome blond) and not me (the alternative weirdo). Another close friend was just as quirky as me but the alternative guys I was in to would swarm to her. She was a smidge prettier and her hair was cooler.

I used to care like you. Nights out with other social groups and making guy friends helped at the time. And now I'm just old enough and comfortable enough with myself to not care.

I have a good man who I met through work and we have kids and shiz and I can just enjoy myself when I hang out with my friends.

In all honesty I'm grateful being the runner up in the looks department - my best looking friend is a hot Asian and is pestered by all the wrong guys and it pisses her off no end. She also struggles to meet the right guys.

Men in bars are always going to scout the room and all head for the most attractive. It sucks but not worth losing a friend over.

Tldr: one day you won't care so much so please don't give up on your friendship. Suck it up, tell her why you've been weird and get on with life. And don't take superficial blokes in bars' opinions as a sign of your worth and attractiveness"
453,"It sounds like you’re doing a great job. I say make sure each compliment is thoughtful. Something like “you’re so pretty!” May not have the same impact as “your cheekbones really make you look so glamorous”. But personalize it! Tell her she rocks! When you see her admiring herself, even a little, lean into it, say “hot damn, who is that fine lady you’re checking out?” Loving yourself is a long, painful process, but with you by her side, she is on the best track. "
454,"There's zero way that showering in the morning causes him to not be able to sleep that night, like 18 hours later. Either it's a mental thing, or he's just using it as an excuse. I wouldn't tolerate that. Either he needs to start showering regularly and get past the mental block or dislike, or he needs to see a medical professional. "
455,"Yup, after I got out of an abusive relationship, all his friends I talked to (who proceeded to hit on me....class acts) would tell me that they knew he was ""bad with women""."
456,"Buzzcut or shaved bald.  That'll look much better than transplants, and likely much better than a CD size hole in your hair.

Do a google image search for Jason Statham, and then Jason Alexander to see the difference."
457,"She sounds like a nightmare, but if you want to smooth it over I would just refollow her and then mute her (new feature, you’re still following them but their shit doesn’t show up on your feed.)"
458,So he’s reasonable and understanding except for when he actually needs to be reasonable and understanding is what it sounds like. 
459,"I’ve been debating it because I hate unnecessary drama. However, I’m moving out of state in 2 weeks so thinking of waiting until I’m safely out of state before I email her. I don’t want a freshly dumped and desperate ex showing up at my door."
460,"""The baby came out of your body. You should've thought about infants popping before feeding it. Stop acting like a brat and just change it.""


Baby needs diapers? You should've thought of that while you were at the store a few days ago, GOD!


I'm joking, but also... not. A baby will only make all of this 100x worse. Both her and that child will be in an awful place."
461,[deleted]
462,"Oh. My. God.

OP, your fiancee needs some help from a therapist. Her issues sound seriously deep and dangerous.

I sure as shit wouldn't have children with someone seemingly so unstable. You need, at **minimum**, some couple's counseling to find out if there is any way to solve this problem. 

Because this is a major red flag for structural flaws in the very foundation of your relationship that you didn't even know were there."
463,"I have to assume this will get worse right away, considering you’ll have to take client meetings that you’ll be bound by an NDA not to disclose anything about.

If she’s freaked by your work phone, I can’t imagine she’ll love “Hey honey, I’ve got a dinner meeting tonight until 9. No, I can’t really tell you what it’s about. You *know* I can’t talk about it, and I *promise* it’s all boring work stuff anyway.”

Your job means you need an SO who can accept less than total transparency when it comes to work. I mean, you’re not in the CIA or anything, but even those folks get married and work it out. She’s being demanding and y’all are incompatible. Juggling her insecurities will drain the joy from your work *and* your relationship."
464,"It doesn't sound like she expects the same amount she has, and she may not view herself as being compatible with the majority of people.  Savers tend to want to be with other savers - especially if you plan to merge finances you don't want to be with someone who's going to want to spend all the money you want to save."
465,"Hmm I'm of a different opinion of most of the people in this thread. It sounds to me like your partner has been financially supporting you throughout this entire process. He made sure to save up to take this risk. Its really sad that it turned out being a musician wasn't what he wanted, and that he failed, but ultimately he made sure to support you financially throughout this entire process.

I would be pretty disappointed to find that the person that I was financially supporting felt resentful towards me for using my money to take a risk on being happy. And not only that, but he's trying to support you through housework too. You are being cared for in almost every way by this person. "
466,"Don't go back. Get a lawyer. Explore your options.

DON'T GO BACK."
467,"As someone who grew up in a household with parents who stayed together ""for my benefit"" it is the worst thing that I could have gone through as a child and teenager and lead sever depression and left me with major issues I'm still trying to work through in my mid twenties.

Really, really reconsider if she's the kind of person you want to have kids with. "
468,"Don’t meet with him. You’re under no obligation to make this easier for him, and frankly someone that shitty for that long, probably is still shitty on some level. Even if he’s 100% a better person now, his actions still have consequences. You deal with them everyday. I don’t know what your sister is thinking. 

You don’t have to be nice to him. You don’t have to see him again. If your sister knew who he was and still chose to date him, she can handle the awkwardness. This is something you for sure should talk over with your therapist before moving forward. "
469,"You are an adult. If you would just start to act like it, your mom would start to treat you as such. 

Give her control of your feelings and she will always manipulate you into giving in. 

Visit r\Justnomil for tons of tips on setting boundaries between adult children and parents. Good luck."
470,There is absolutely no way in hell I would let you watch my kid again after that. I would make a heartfelt apology and leave it at that.
471,Hire the divorce attorney before making any changes.
472,"&gt;But my sister thinks meeting her could help motivate him and get him excited about the future

This is literally the worst reason to get him motivated. He could be imagining a relationship while she wants to meet him once just to check up. He could be devastated if she never meets him again. Meet her first to vet her intentions of she asks again. If she refuses then she's only thinking about herself and not your brother.  "
473,Being blunt is the best method.   People on the spectrum often miss social cues so being blunt will be the best approach.
474,"IMO the kids will have a better childhood if the parents divorce and have a custody agreement that's civil and fair, than if the parents stay together, cheat on each other, and otherwise bicker each day.

Kids have a tendency to interpret every fight between the parents as if it's somehow their fault.

If your fiancée doesn't get some counseling and doesn't improve her outlook fast, you need to get out of the relationship.  Take her threats to destroy you at face value; weapons are available everywhere, and people who are that crazy are that crazy.  If YOU ever were to threaten her that way, she would fear for her life; you should for yours."
475,"Why did you marry someone who refuses to see you as a team? Why did you marry someone who doesn't respect you? Did you think he'd suddenly be better once you were married, or was he not always like this?

Either way...this is not what a functional relationship looks like. This guy would probably take your future children's clothes out of the washer to wash his own, too. 

And if he's super nice to everyone else, that means he's actively and deliberately choosing to treat you like this. He will help others, but not you. Because you don't matter to him. 

Do you want to be with someone who makes it clear that you're not and will never be a priority?"
476,"&gt;He asks me daily “ do you want my babies “

ugh, this made me shudder in disgust.

OK, now that that's out of the way - dump him. He's lovebombing you and moving WAY WAY WAY too fast. 

&gt;I feel like my entire family is going to be mad if I end this.

Fuck your family. You've only been dating this guy a MONTH, how the fuck are they so invested in him already? "
477,"You can't change her parents' views, but you need to talk to your GF about how badly her parents are damaging your relationship.  If she can't get them to back off, she'll either have to cut them out of her life, or you'll have to just admit that she's effectively choosing them over you."
478,[deleted]
479,"There's a Captain Awkward letter about this (#820 if you want to google) and it basically says ""Some men are just...too much trouble, girl. This guy is one of them."" 

It seems like some people have weirdly low cleanliness standards AND a side of extreme, harmful to self stubborness. Those people need to be single. 

For ""how do I dump him"" I'd give him a call and say ""BF, I've decided that we're not compatible. While I care for you and wish you the best, this isn't working. If you need to talk, I'm here, but I think a clean break would be best."" 

MAYBE give him one chance to realize how serious you are because honestly...99% of men don't take women seriously and then ""suddenly"" their wives leave ""out of nowhere"" despite having been told roughly 4 million times that roaches are not okay. I'd sit him down and explain this is a deal breaker and is he willing to lose you over it. don't fall into the ""stop or I'll tell you to stop again"" trap. Your words have to have meaning and follow through. 

Best of luck. "
480,"Don't give notice until you have a confirmed, accepted job offer and start date at the new place.

As far as your current job goes, who of the remaining people do you think is best suited to replace you?  Have that person work closely with you in developing the new plan, so that they can take over once you leave.  "
481,"&gt;I wanted to include my brother at some level in the wedding, so we were going to add him and his daughter as ushers- we just haven’t let them know yet. 

This is a good solution.

&gt;When my mom called last night, she made it sound like my entire family is upset with us that we have not included my brother as a groomsman. She said people are talking about it

Doubtful.  Its most likely just your mom and brother talking about this.

&gt;“It’s not just your wedding, it’s OUR wedding too.”

No, it's not.  It is YOUR wedding and you are paying for it.  You need to stomp all over this so she doesn't continue to push boundaries associated with your wedding decisions.

Time for you to get your mom out of the middle of this and give your brother a call to ask if he and his daughter will be ushers.
"
482,"Your girlfriend is horrible. She lied and destroyed this girl's life. No wait! She lied and destroyed her SISTER's life. So if you do something that fits her definition of horrible and she destroys your life? What then? Did you just deserve it? 

I wouldn't trust her. That's all that I am going to say. Have you seen Gone Girl by any chance or read it? Because your girlfriend reminds me of Amy. "
483,"Yes, because this is HIS mother. You shouldn't have the added emotional labor of dealing with her on things like this.

I ask you again: why is she the expert on your child?"
484,"So if I make a small list of things in your post that jump out at me immediately, I see:

-He gets mad when you don't beg for money for him

-He gets scary when he gets angry

-He does not stick to meal plans or budgets

-He does not make you feel like you can talk to him openly without anger

-He makes you do things you're not comfortable with like bugging that woman you mentioned for money

To me, it's very obvious he is a manipulator and is NOT someone you should stick around. Leave for your own good. "
485,"I won't lie, I get a little heated when this subreddit comes up and the ole classic ""everyone just tells you to leave!"" immediately comes out. I don't think I have ever seen a post that did not deserve all of the comments advising to leave.

It also completely neglects  to acknowledge the context...if someone has been driven to the point to even post on Reddit in the first place, isn't that a pretty big sign already? And that leads to the also very common post from people actually NEEDING a barrage of comments telling them to leave. People that know they need to leave, they just need some validation...and we give that to them! 

Reddit has helped a lot of people, and this and other relationship subreddits have helped a lot of people, and it's usually been through a barrage of replies saying ""leave!""

That's all I'm saying. /End rant"
486,"Yeah, it’ll be her baby and he’ll expect her to look after it instead of being so entitled to expect that he’d just share the load. "
487,"I have been in her position before. I would have loved for someone to have called the cops to get my SO to stop, because I couldn't. I would call them. "
488,"I'm sorry you're hurting, but thankful this relationship is over. Don't take him back if he comes back later. Anyone who dumps you because you weren't willing to finance his irresponsibility (and regardless of whatever bullshit rationale he threw at you, that's why he did this) isn't worth your time.         

Also, you can try to get him to sign an IOU and repay that money, but I suspect it's going to be your version of the asshole tax everyone has to pay at some point in their life.      "
489,"&gt;I was also told in no uncertain terms that if I went rogue and sat with my boyfriend, then I would be removed from the wedding without a second glance.

This comment would be the end for me.  I would have said enjoy your wedding, I won't be there.

&gt;I don’t think it’s fair to expect my boyfriend to do this (he is providing many of the decorations free of charge as he works for a party planning business) when he’s excluded from being a part of the celebrations. My boyfriend is also expected to be chauffeuring family from the church to the reception after photos have been taken 

You and your BF can enjoy a nice quiet date night at home instead.

Tell you mom about this so she hears your side of the story and knows you were will to compromise and your brother wouldn't."
490,seriously. i also would NOT be comfortable with a bf who spends a lot of time with my best friend and admittedly has a crush on her. that would make my skin crawl. i'd also be looking at the best friend differently. this is so fucked up. 
491,"He's a creep who preys on younger women.  Is this a friend group? 
 Why are any of you hanging out with this guy?  He's a horrible person. "
492,"I've got an idea!! People here are validating your concerns, but not offering a ton of practical advice. I've got a device in my car that was supplied by my insurance company that basically tracks my driving habits and either increases or decreases my rates based on what it finds.

The important part is that anytime I brake hard, it chides me, so I've been wayyyy more sensitive to my driving habits. If you were to get that, then it's not you correcting her, instead an objective little device beeping every time she brakes suddnely. From the sounds of it, it seems that her big issue is hard braking, so this may be a way to hold up a mirror."
493,"I think you should unleash your girlfriend and start taking notes when she stands up for herself and others.  I've dated anxious people before, and I've never been more annoyed and frustrated by them than when their intense compulsion to absolutely never offend, inconvenice, or upset other people applied to everyone else except me."
494,"I was in an abusive relationship in my teen years, and it really messed with me in all kinds of ways.  While I should have been learning about how relationships work, I learned about how to placate an abuser.  It's really hard to describe how it gets into your head, but it does.

That said, you don't deserve to be cheated on and you can't fix your girlfriend.  I think you need to have a really honest conversation with her.  She needs therapy to process her trauma, and she needs to cut all contact with that guy, whether you are together or not.

You are not a bad or unsupportive person if you end your relationship over this."
495,Lol 30 seconds. Yeah girl move on you can definitely get much better than that from someone who will actually put in the work to make you feel good too!!! 
496,That’s not unintentional 
497,No one should ever make their SO feel bad about not wanting to participate in a sexual act they are uncomfortable with.  This applies to both women and men.  This sounds like an insecurity of her own that she needs to work on.  And it's definitely wrong of her to shame you for not wanting to do something you're not comfortable with or to pressure you into doing something you don't want to.  
498,"&gt; Do I risk the great thing we have for years to try the unknown or do I try to get over this?

If you met a hot man, and maybe even one who propositioned you, and you really wanted to have sex with him, would you be prepared to throw away your entire marriage for some hot sex?

If the answer is no, then what difference does it make if it was a woman you were fantasizing about instead?

If the answer is yes, you should probably let your husband find someone else."

500,"&gt; Part of Tom's problem with the training program situation is that the co-worker didn't tell me about the program, I overheard him telling someone else he applied.

And WHO CARES? Why does your boyfriend even CARE about this??? He's borderline nuts. OMG OP, I'd quit the relationship now before it drives you insane. He's never going to stop. He's one of those people who's convinced he's right and nothing will change his mind. A self-righteous person. They don't make good SO's."
501,Always take the dream job.  
502,"I am a bit confused. You and Ashley have been dating a year and Jake, your best friend, just met her a month ago. And then you say this:

&gt; Jake is a very competitive and sometimes jealous type of person, and I'm sure that he feels a bit threatened by the fact that I have another significant person vying for my time. 

Have you not been spending time with your friends since you have been dating her? Why is she just meeting your best friend? Honestly the way it reads to me is that your friends want to spend time with you and have missed you being more present with them and that your girlfriend may not be a joy for them to be around. I really cannot imagine yelling at my partner's best friend the second time I ever met them. It is possible you kept the two separate for the time you did because you knew they wouldn't get along?"
503,"She doesn’t like them. Just because you like them and think they’re cute doesn’t mean that’s it’s a thing she can suddenly like about herself. If it’s already a thing that’s effecting her self-esteem, you might want to consider corrective dentistry because she might just get it done herself eventually. It’ll just take longer and cause her more unhappiness."
504,"Its so gross he's trying to teach his wife lessons. This isn't the time for ""tough love."" My abusive bf would do shit like this to me and it felt so creepy like his rationale was what a parent would use. OP's husband isn't her fucking dad. He isn't the person to teach her lessons. And if he were, stranding your SO in the bathroom without toilet paper is not the effing way to do it! What an asshole"
505,"I get how you feel –– but I actually think it is pretty important for you to consider the drugs and the context when you think about the future of your relationship with these people. You say in another comment that you can't even trust that they'll show up sober when they come to apologize to your dad. You don't necessarily need to cut them out of your life forever, but it might be time to think about setting some boundaries with these friends. It sounds like they're taking their lives in a direction that is increasingly incompatible with your own."
506,"&gt; I can't say I fault you for being logical about it especially considering she isn't insured.

That alone gives me pause.  OP, you need to realize that if you let your GF drive your car and she gets into an accident, that's a claim on *your* car insurance because it's a permissive use.  The other party would come after *you* as the owner of the car because your GF has no insurance policy or assets. 

I would not take that risk. "
507,This. Move on. It is clear he doesn't respect you.

509,"&gt; I am starting to meet her extended family.

The appropriate time is likely before this happens. "
510,"OK first off, tell Ms Holden Caulfield over here to grow the fuck up and respect your social life, and stop casting judgments upon every social interaction you have. People like her who are obsessed with ""authenticity"" and ""being real"" generally have a very arbitrary and child-like view of what is ""authentic"" and constantly use this random, arbitrary high bar to decry what everyone else around them is doing. It's just a tactic to feel superior to all the people around you. I would find this incredibly exhausting. 

First off - there is nothing authentic about you liking friends and wanting social time with your peers, and then you fold on that desire and don't hang out with your amigos because your GF judges you for it. That is super inauthentic, and mark my words if you do change yourself to fit her ""I just read Atlas Shrugged"" world view, I 100% promise she'll lose respect for you and judge you anyway. Judgmental assholes are going to judge - they trick you into thinking that if you meet their standards, you'll get their approval. But really they just move the bar. What is ""authentic"" and what is ""inauthentic"" to them is constantly shifting, it never stays static -- this keeps you always contorting to fit the new definition. 

I would also tell her that it's OK to have seperate social lives - but she is 100% in the wrong for treating you like shit and saying ""she no longer feels connected to you"" because she observed you cooking with friends. If she doesn't want to hang out with your clique that's totally fine, she doesn't have to. But she shouldn't just linger nearby giving you the withering judgmental glare because you aren't a ""freethinking individual who rises above social expectations to have friends.""

You are dating a close-minded, narcissistic snob who read too much pretentious lit in high school, and is judging you based on a philosophy that she probably hasn't even fleshed out herself. There is no win here - you fold and be like her with your friends (aka cut them off) then you only appease her temporarily. Let Thoreau go live on her pond and judge us lesser humans for enjoying casual company. "
511,"Because it’s not as innocent as you think. You mentioned him constantly complimenting a girl and tried to defend it because she’s gorgeous. A person in a committed relationship doesn’t do that - he likes chasing girls and flirting. 

And he stayed out all night - failed to tell you honestly who he was with. If my partner did that - fail to arrive home, lie about who he was with - I would have been livid. "
512,"Yeah, if anything she's on the younger side of realising she doesn't want children. "
513,"I agree - I didn't grow up like that, either, and I think it's a good thing that I learned to entertain myself and that sometimes, you're just gonna be bored.  It's a part of life."
514,"Confirmed, I'm ugly and happy."
515,[deleted]
516,"That was another thing that bothered me, he never contacted me to see if I made it to my uber, to my car, or back home safely. Then when I got in bed I sent him a message asking to let me know when he got home safe, and he made a few taunting comments then never let me know when he got home. "
517,"The division line is something we've definitely brought up, but she just for some reason assumed that I'd be able to get my work email on my phone because ""that's what most people do"". I have been having a good time with her but especially if this were to go far down the road (0 plans to really ever leave this industry) this would probably only get worse with her insecurity here."
518,"""Hey, I went to a ... convention the other day and saw something you might get a kick out of..."" 

I've learned that the phrase ""get a kick out of"" sounds more platonic. "
519,"Seriously, joke about it. 

I proposed on a mountain with our friends after a really hellish day of people (my best man) getting lost and we thought he was dead lol... 

Then when I propose, she goes ""Wait, why are our friends here??"" before she said yes lol. 

She never thought I'd actually do it in front of people. "
520,"Definitely sounds like there's a trust issue happening there if she's approaching strangers with details of their relationship. 

Best thing would be not to reply and let him know, who knows what she is to him, she could be some kind of stalker. "
521,"Just so you know, your mother didn't spend £120 on the coffee machine, she spent probably £50 and is pocketing the rest.  That's why she can't show you the receipt. The aggressive name calling (""brat"") is so you drop it and just accept the situation without further questions. "
522,"&gt;Now that I’m less in denial I have tried opening dialogues with my parents and they shut me down. They make fun of me sometimes for being too sensitive. Maybe I’ll try to get them to come in for family therapy. 

Don't bother. Child abusers rarely admit they abused children. Your parents won't. "
523,I think you should tell your dad about this stuff. And try to go to court for him to get custody of you
524,"What did he say prior to your best friend's response?

Sounds like he sent the message to the wrong girl, then panicked when he realized he messaged your best friend. There is literally no way to explain way the ""Who Is X?"" text. 

I'm sorry he's such an asshole. At least he's stupid enough that you caught him earlier than later (and in a way that couldn't be explained away). "
525,"He already knows, what I'm worried about is them cutting access between us and him and then brainwashing him. "
526,"This so much. The credit is yours, OP. We, internet strangers, are proud of you. I promise you deserve to be proud of yourself. "
527,"“He told me I sound dumb and I’m overreacting”

Well that’s just really rude and immature of him. It’s also gaslighting if he’s actually into her. 

Try this: ask if you can have 2 nights a week at home just the 2 of you. 

Also... point out that it’s your fucking house too and you don’t want to host someone every single day. "
528,I gave up on ever checking Snapchat maps because it’s been so terribly inaccurate for me. Just something to keep in mind. 
529,"I would think of this like any other illness. If my friend was consistently ""sick"" whenever I needed her help/support, but had no problem taking care of her own business or doing fun things, I would feel used.  But I wouldn't feel used if my friend was just sick most of the time, or happened to be sick when I was moving. I think it's only a problem if it's a pattern."
530,"&gt; didn't want to speak to me for a few days because I was stressing him out 

How *convenient* for him. He takes some time away from you right around the time he is meeting up with another woman and is blaming it on you. So if something happens between them he can blame it on the fact he thought you were on a break and it was somehow your fault."
531,"Yeah, your mom is cruel and manipulative. You had to beg her to meet this guy and she sabotaged the evening. You need to let go of the expectation that once she meets him she will get over it. That's clearly not happening."
532,"Honestly - I am more curious about you guys being together for only “about” a year and are already married. Should have waited at least a few years before tying the knot seeing as you don’t know the type of person your wife is.  
  
Which is shady. What she is doing is very very shady."
533,"The legal separation makes perfect sense, if you try and see what the husband is trying to do. I read this as ""I love my wife, and I regret not exploring more when i was younger because I feel like I missed something. And its driving me crazy. But I know it would hurt my wife, so maybe if we separate, it will create some distance to help her cope, and then we can get back together"".

It isn't thought out very well and I dont think it's a good idea at all, but I see compassion here, not manipulation or malice."
534,So have you considered the possibility that this is a bad relationship for you? 
535,"Something you have to keep in mind is that for the entire length of your relationship, she was a teenager, a veritable child. When you're 16, 17, 18, talking about a future and a marriage and a family with four babies and all that is 100% fantasy. No different than daydreaming about how it'll be when you're a movie star - pure fantasy.

So it's great that she's come to her senses *before* getting married. This conversation would've been a lot more difficult if you'd been married for two years and you were thinking it was high time to really get down to the business of making babies.

Now it's your time to think over your life goals. You say it's not a deal-breaker, but are you being true to yourself there? If you've been really into the idea of having kids, are you for real able to say ""ok, no big deal, I don't want kids""."
536,"The problem is that to hear him explain these ""accidents"" it always magically turns out his wife/girlfriend/whoever was manipulating him and lying about being on birth control. Yet somehow despite believing women are crazy and can't be trusted, he'll bang them anyway with no condom! Then play the victim later saying ""she said she was on the pill! I trusted her!"" Never his fault, never his responsibility. 

Hasn't stopped me from already having given him several boxes."
537,DON'T CLEAN HIS HOUSE FOR FUCKS SAKE 
538,"It is a shame when kids aren't raised well. But unfortunately, unless there is abuse or neglect to the degree where the kids are in danger, this is the price that we pay for a free society. People are allowed to have kids and raise them badly and there's not a whole hell of a lot that you can do about it.

The animal abuse and the dog poop and dirty diapers lying around the house might be sufficient to get CPS involved, but if your brother and SIL can get the house clean, since there's no physical abuse or drugs it's unlikely they would be removed. You could monitor the situation closely and get them involved if you see any signs of abuse.

I had a neglected niece and the best thing you can do is to stay in their lives. You offer to watch them as much as possible. You expose them to a safe and nurturing environment. You develop a personal loving relationship where they can get another perspective on the world. My niece is now 16 and instead of trying to kill herself last month, she ran away and came to live with us for a while. These are difficult situations to navigate because her parents are so dysfunctional but they are still her parents -- but I personally am still glad that she has us as an alternative to suicide. 

You could be that person for your nieces and nephews, but only if it doesn't disrupt your life to the point where you can't handle it.





"
539,She's crying because she didn't get her way. You're not the bad guy.
540,"So, the good news is, she's an evangelical Christian who for five months did not push her religion on you.  

The bad news is, you're going to have to have a hard conversation with her.  That conversation looks like this: 

""What do you want from your life, do you imagine having kids, do you want them raised in the church?""

And then you need to think about what you want. And decide from there."
541,"""Hi Anna. Your boyfriend is still here at the apartment. I had planned to spend this time alone. He doesn't seem to respond to me, so I am hoping you can let him know it's time for him to head home."" "
542,"Everyone is right on this. You don't show up unless you're actively using the app and since it was a recent photo, that's even more obvious. Unless he came forward and he straight up admitted, ""yeah I downloaded it with my buddy and showed him what it's like and must have forgotten to delete it."" He is probably lying to you. 

Downloading tinder doesn't mean he's 100% cheating, but if he's lying, which he clearly is, he is probably cheating/trying to."
543,I had an ex that was this way for my *public education* job. We sometimes go to different cities for college recruitment. Jealousy was one of the major nails in the coffin 
544,"Go stay with a friend or at a Air BnB asap, get out of there. 

&gt;What the fuck do I even do from here?

Once you are out, cut all contact.  Block on all social media and phone.  Focus on your schooling and your hobbies.  

If you lack hobbies, now you have plenty of time for them, try all the new things,  try things you thought you could not do.  You will end up so much happier I promise!

This is gonna be hard and painful and sad.  But do not prolong it, do not seek ""closure"", just rip the band aid off, so to speak, and start living your new best life! 

You have got this, be strong and lean n your family and friends as much as you have to. "
545,"He's only been in  a somewhat aware state for 3 months; I think you are right for not wanting to upset that progress. Maybe after a year or so in that state, he can handle a little more drama."
546,Wow. Thanks for the update OP. I hope that she gets the help she needs and well done for joining the dots on this before she did anything more sinister. 
547,"I agree. That is something. It's almost harder because I can't stay angry that he shared his feelings. I just keep sinking into despair. 

He promised to make an appointment to see a counselor which is a big deal for him. He's never been before. I did go to couples counseling a few times with the ex who cheated on me. Based on that experience I don't see how it could make this any better."
548,"Yeah that's weird. I'd ask her about her reaction and why she's so opposed to kids being taught about a perfectly normal bodily function. But honestly depending on where you are, there are HUGE differences in how masturbation is viewed/taught to girls vs. to boys. When she said 

&gt;  it's something private that shouldn't be talked about with anyone else

that's probably what she was taught. It's a common but outdated view. 

Also just want to point out to her, they're not teaching kids how to masturbate. They're probably just trying to normalize it (like you said), and how to do it safely, which is great. "
549,"My ex did this when we broke up. Not the crying for sex, but sent me snapchats of him crying. It was really cringey and probably had the opposite effect of what he was hoping to accomplish."
550,"Maribel is treating you like you're her sugar daddy.  You aren't ever getting repaid the money you lent her.

Don't give/lend Maribel any more money.  Don't pay her way for trips or anything else.  If she stays with you when you aren't funding ger lifestyle, then the relationship is real.  "
551,My snapchat had my wife in Spain when she was right next to me in New Zealand...
552,"Are you guys spending any time together as a family? I think 4 days of separate time from being together is way too much, personally. "
553,"Yeah, the moment you typed ""They actually often threatened to send us to these troubled camps"" that advice becomes dangerous.

But wow, two years from now, all three kids can show them the middle finger and they'll never hear from any of you again. And they'll never understand why. Idiots."
554,This is the right answer. One would think that you would immediately apologize after destroying a sentimental object; not attack her for your mistake.

560,"After reading and re-reading this post, unless OP's husband is a sadistic MF, the only conclusion I can draw is that her husband does not like her. This is beyond resentment. This is true dislike of a person. He not only makes her feel unloved, he makes sure she *knows* she's unloved by doing calculated actions to demonstrate his dislike of her existence, such as actively taking her laundry out the washer just to do his own and saying nothing to her. Like... WHAT... THE... FUCK... if my laundry was in the washer, my fiance would be texting me to ask if I wanted my clothes washed and what settings to use!"
561,Feels nice to read this. I think  people in this sub advice breaking up a lot more than is needed. Good that u stuck with him 
562,"That would be considered cheating in almost all relationships.

But if you don't care, then you do you."
563,"&gt; To this he suggested we just use a credit card...he'd rather pay off debt in the future than have a job right now. Sorry but that's just a bad idea. 

Whatever you do OP do not have your name anywhere near this credit card. All the debt needs to be in his name alone and don't you dare marry this man until this is sorted out.

And the reason she hasn't pursued claims of you having cheated is because she knows she cheated.  She may even have talked to the person she who gave her the STD and confirmed that's where she got it.  

She definitely cheated."
567,"He sounds insufferable.  I may be older but the last thing I would need from a partner is judging and criticizing everything I say or do.

The types of “lies” you are telling are socially appropriate in my opinion.  No one needs to know the darkest dirtiest details of our private time or thought process.  Actually we would probably all be fired and have no friends if we were 10O% honest about everything.

Tell him to stop criticizing you and he can take a hike if he doesn’t like it.  Best of luck to him finding someone who can meet his idealistic standard of ethics

EDIT:  I’d also argue some of his ethics are in fact the unethical choice such as writing an inauthentic positive review for someone, or covering for an underperforming co-worker"
568,"Hopping on the top comment to mention that OP says later down that her bf refuses to accept a ""no"" for sexual intercourse and instead she has to perform other sexual acts on him!!! OP this guy is not worth it and sexual coercion is never okay! You're so concerned about how you make him feel but you need to look at how he makes you feel. "
569,"&gt; He admitted she's fun to look at, but he never intended anything to happen in any way. He claims he just was bored and a bit drunk and wanted company.

There are 3 outcomes here:

1. He's already cheated
2. He's planning on cheating
3. He'd cheat if the opportunity presented itself"

572,"“No.”

There’s your answer. You don’t have to justify it, or explain why not, or be drawn into a discussion about it.

574,"He doesn't want to commit to you, and he's willing to throw every fallacy and illogical hoop at you to divert you away from commitment. He doesn't even want any part of a relationship that isn't just fun. That's why he was more worried about sex than your health when you told him you were spotting. He's willing to talk about all of the big things, like kids, marriage and the future, but only if it's fun and never includes even a thought of being difficult. It really seems like he wants a fairy tale relationship, where everything is always butterflies and sunshine."

577,"I had a stalker in college for three semesters. I had met the guy once for about five minutes, and from that moment on, he believed that we were dating and would follow me around campus from a distance of about 20 feet. Every time I looked behind me, he was there. I lived on campus too so it was scary. I would have to loop around and try to make sure I had lost him before going home because I didn’t want him to know where I lived. He memorized my class schedule every semester it seemed. He would just look for me on campus and start following me. 

Called the police half a dozen times, printed out the emails (he got my email address from a class sign in sheet and would randomly email me) that showed he believed we were in a romantic relationship and gave them to the police, told cops how scared I was..., they told me they couldn’t really do anything and to just keep a paper trail. Ok. Cool.  So I guess if he kills me and marries my corpse, you’ll have a good head start on the investigation. 👍

Edit: I think I clarified in a later post, but my stalker was obviously suffering from a severe mental illness and needed help. Part of my frustration was that the police should have intervened to get him help at the very least. He was a very sick, possibly schizophrenic young college student. The police could have at least attempted to contact his family to let them know something was going on. Stalkers are not always bad people. They may be very sick, like my stalker and the woman in the OP. It’s still scary to be the victim of a mentally ill stalker, and I don’t discount that. I feel like an intervention is necessary not just to help the stalkee but to get help for the stalker as well before things escalate.  I really wish the police did more in these situations - not just to punish or deter the stalker but to bring in mental health resources when resources are needed. "
578,"&gt; I just feel like everyone keeps needing something from me.

This is pretty common in moms with newborns. You have this needy, helpless human being physically attached to you every two hours, and the last thing you want is another needy human being touching you. 

&gt; He knows this but everytime he wants a BJ or just puts my hand on his dick

Are you sure he is 31 and not 13? Did he really reach adulthood without having learned to express his sexual needs with words or to seduce you? Next time he asks for a BJ, tell him, ""nah, but if you want to go down on me, I'm up for that."" I think you need someone paying attention to *you* and meeting *your* needs for a change.

&gt; we currently live with my mom

&gt;  actively ""help"" unless it's his day off (and again, he helps by doing what I ask him to do)

&gt; my mom who helps

Ok, your mom helps. Your fiance does not ""help."" Neither does he parent, which is what it's called when it's your own damn baby. I don't care if he's conflicted about being childfree and having a baby. He has a baby. Time to face reality. He can be conflicted to himself, with you and the kid, he needs to be all in.

&gt;  I breastfeed and she doesn't drink my stash so I can't be away for too long. 

I understand from listening to women that pumping sucks, but can you pump the rest of your stash so you can be away from your kid for longer while your fiance parents?

&gt; But I guess I also have some anxieties at this point with leaving her because I haven't gone out in so long.

I admit, I am not a woman, and I am not a parent. So maybe there is perspective I am missing. But think of it this way, the kid's father can handle be away. There is no earthly reason why he should be more able to be away from his kid than you. It's his kid. So, emulate your fiance, and take some time away from the kid. If pumping is not an option and you can only be away for an hour, then take that hour. It will be good for your health to have some time to yourself.

Find something out of the house for your mom to do for that hour, too, bc otherwise, I guarantee your fiance will dump the baby on your mom.

You will have to be understanding that your fiance will make mistakes and willdo things differently than you do. If he makes mistakes, fix the aftermath and remind him that practice makes perfect. It's not like you came with baby knowledge pre-installed. If he doesn't things differently, as long as the baby is not actually in danger or about to suffer diaper rash or something, let him do things differently.

Good luck."
579,"&gt; he said that he and his fiancée had changed their mind and didn’t want partners involved in the wedding at all. 

Tell him ok, but ask him where he will get the decorations, the driver, etc...

Because no partners involved at all, means you ask nothing to them.

But as others suggested, you should free two seats. Because even if you bf wants to play it nice, there is a border to not cross, and become a doormat. And that's what he wants to do, be a doormat, for the sake to not hurt anybody, except him, and you.

580,"From my reading of the original post, I doubt she had literal, diagnosable PTSD. She definitely had some serious psychological hang-ups about driving that she had to work through, but it sounds like it was more rooted in her upbringing than her trauma."

I remember being antsy to leave the first small apartment, not so much because I didn't like it, but because we had always planned to move to a bigger place before starting to try for kids. I remember nagging my partner somewhat about moving because I didn't want to constantly talk about wanting to have children (because moving seemed like a less sensitive subject). She's 31, maybe she feels like her biological clock is ticking? Like others have said, maybe try to talk to her about wether something else is behing the desperation to move."

It may help ease the sting a little if next time you can work in a ""I'm delighted that you're well-paid, when are you taking me out to a nice dinner to celebrate? ;)""

It would probably hurt a lot less if he was making any sort of attempt to have his success also be your success, in a 'rising tide lifts all boats' kind of way. I get that he can't, like, bring home lunch sushi in a takeout box for you, but he can at least use a little of his extra $5 an hour to take you on a nice date.

Kind of side note, but I am also really side-eyeing his ""I can't believe I'm getting paid this much to do basically intro stuff."" I'm a CS major, and especially with internships you actually don't really want to be doing intro stuff, you want to be doing work that will prepare you for the real working world. It might be easy *now*, but when he has to explain his summer work when job searching he's either going to have to be real good at bullshitting (and then learning *real fast*), or he's going to end up in a mediocre job.

589,"Came here to say this.

Sometimes a ""break"" really is a break. I took a break from a relationship about 4 months into seeing this guy when both of our lives got REALLY tumultuous. Had we been together longer we agreed that the relationship would be a source of support. However at that time we didn't feel close enough to share such personal issues going on in our private lives. It felt like putting a lot of heavy expectation on a new relationship. And the relationship felt like another stress. So we broke it off with the intention to get in contact in ""a few months"" if and when things leveled off. We did, dated 3 years after that and it was great. The reason we split up for good was he wanted to move out of the country for a job and I didn't feel it was smart for me to be tied to one person and only one person in a country where I didn't speak the language and probably would have a hard time working. 

However most breaks are a prelude to a breakup. A break or getting back together will only work if the issues that caused the problems are resolved. If you legally separate he'll..... what? Decide you're good enough again if he can't find a better offer? Because that's how it will shake down. He doesn't want time to resolve an issue, he wants time to see if he can ""trade up"". "

No, you're enabling her to make *choices.* Choices are often mistakes when you're young and still getting educated, but literally c'est la fucking vie. Everyone ought to be enabled to make mistakes while they're young and can do so relatively consequence free. Your parents are nuts and you're the best sibling ever. "
594,"He's wrong. It's normal for people to have active hobbies including martial arts. Yes, you will occasionally have to say ""oh, I do [martial art], that bruise is from sparring"" or whatever, but most people get that.

595,"&gt; We have only been together for roughly two months

Two months? Move on. Chess has been a constant your whole life. Your gf doesn't have to love chess or understand what you get from it, but she does have to accept that it is something important to you and you are going to continue doing it. She does not. Move on.

If this were a long term girlfriend and your chess was impinging on the time you spent together or the time you spent maintaining a shared living space, then I would say she has a point. Two months, though. Just move on."

598,"&gt; He has told me before that if I could react more lightheartedly, it would help him control his reactions...

Nope. Fuck that. 

He is responsible for his choices, he is responsible for his actions. He does not get to antagonize you to his heart's content and then make you bear all the emotional burdens. Your reaction did not take place in a vacuum, you did not yell at him at random, you yelled at him as he is alated his disregard for your stated desires and boundaries. You are not obligated to coddle the feelings of someone who is so in hiterested in harming your own, regardless of their reasons.

I think that when you discuss this it needs to be clear that when you ask for so.ething to stop, it needs to stop because the need to care for one another flows both ways. Otherwise that negativity feeds into itself and this, easily avoided situation happens. He is showing you that he only takes you seriously when you yell."
599,"The thing is, a lot of abusers are super charming to their friends, coworkers, family, etc. That's how so many abusers get away with abusing their spouse: they are friendly, funny, hard-working people to everyone who's an ""outsider"", while they release their uppent frustration of the day (even just their irrational angry violence)  behind close doors. So when the spouse overcomes their shame and tells other people, a lot of people don't believe them. ""Are you sure he was really yelling at you?"" ""Wow, you must've him really angry - it takes two to tango you know."" ""Steve? Steve wouldn't do that, I've known him for many years, he's a really great guy."" 

Or, like now: ""Maybe he's going through something"". I think you're a stand-up guy (literally :)) but please don't shut your eyes to the possibility that your friend has always been this way. It may very well be possible that over the last couple of relationships his behavior has slowly worsened, and that it's now normalized (to him) to the point where he also shows (part of) it in public. 

And to add to that: the behavior of the rest of your friends is condoning his abuse. The fact that up til now nobody spoke up, was his sign that ""this is okay, I can act like this without a social fallout"". Personally, I wouldn't have been surprised that if nobody had said anything for a longer period of time, eventually he would've slapped her in public as well. Abuse worsens over time. 

tl;dr \*You\* may know him as a great guy. But you've not been his SO, you have not spend time with him in such a relationship. You don't know what he's been like behind closed doors. "

So, first thing first,  if you can help get your sister out of that living situation and into some therapy because I guarantee you she has a lot of emotional and mental stuff to unpack now. 

On to the.. uh... negligence stuff. Your mom is an adult, she is responsible for herself unless it has been deemed that she needs someone to care for her. Generally, at least where I am, that caretaker process is a little more formal because it can include you receiving money from the state to help take care of the person in question. Regardless, there is such thing as self negligence too. Even IF your mom called the police to report that she was being neglected they would most likely hold it to some sort of self neglect situation and put her in a care facility, or help arrange for services to help her. Again, that is what we do. Your locale might be different so don’t stress over it too much. Your mom is using guilt, fear and manipulation to try and keep you all involved in her life. You don’t owe her anything more than being her children."

606,"Whether or not he cheated is one story - but you definitely have trust issues even though you indicated otherwise. Watching someone's location on a map does absolutely nothing for their safety, all you are doing is giving yourself piece of mind.  You can't see a robbery or an assault on a map, and luckily for your husband there isn't a huge market for kidnapping adult men in the US.  You indicated below you have anxiety, and I think it is extending into obsessive behavior.  If a man had posted this, watching his wife's location, and accusing her of cheating even though she even offered to drive the husband to the supposed house, the comments here would be very different. If you trust your partner then you have to give him the benefit of the doubt when he tells you nothing is going on AND offers to give hard evidence by driving to the scene of the supposed cheating.  All you can do other than that is speculate.  "

People worry about injured women. I think that's a good thing for society overall. People are much less likely to worry about women who post about their training regimens all the time and about the injuries that naturally result. I used to be an avid climber and was always banged up from the wall. Never thought twice about it, nor did anyone else, as far as I know. "

However, what matters here is *not* your relationship with your sister, what matters is your relationship with your brother-in-law. And, if applicable, with your nieces and nephews. The question isn't whether you should hide your sister's actions, its whether you owe him the truth or not. I'm pretty confident that if you think about it, you'll know the answer. It could go either way, I have in-laws that I don't owe anything at all to, but I also have in-laws to whom I'm closer than the actual blood relatives they married. Being the 'nicest guy ever' isn't necessarily enough, but it's still something you have to judge. 

Don't ask whether you should keep your sister's secrets. Instead, ask whether her husband should hear the truth from you."

Good lord, what a bunch of bullshit. You couldn't even have any more of those good times with her if she wouldn't spend time with you. And to twist a problem she created back onto you is just horrible. I guess it's not surprising after the way she treated you when you brought this issue up with her last week. She is going to cringe every time she remembers this in the future, but hopefully she'll use that as motivation to improve herself.

I think you did well given the circumstances. Breakups hurt and there's no way to avoid that, regardless of how much you care for them or want to do it as nicely as possible. And you really did the right and kind thing for yourself and her."
621,"You don’t need to let this go. She’s not using the middle name because it’s more natural for her and easier to pronounce. She’s not using it as a grandma/grandchild nickname. She’s using it out of spite, and because she doesn’t respect YOUR language/culture. 

When she refers to your child by its middle name or a pointed nickname, politely but firmly correct her; especially when she does it in front of/to other people (“oh, actually her/his name is __.”). You and your husband should both do this, every single time. Maybe other close family members too if possible. Introduce and refer to the baby as its first name, often, to reduce confusion with other relatives. If she pushes, don’t back down. “This is the name we chose for our child, we have asked you to use it. Please respect our choice.” If she’s going to disrespect a name, even if you compromised with the middle name AND last name, she will fight you on every choice you make between your culture and hers, big or small.

Maybe you can have a conversation to assuage her fears on culture exposure; explain (as a team) that both cultures are important to you and the upbringing of your child. Assure her you want her to involve her grandchild in her culture, as it will be involved with yours. But that can only happen if she respects your decisions as partners and parents, AND RESPECTS *YOUR* CULTURE.

Is it absolutely necessary she stay with you until the baby is 5 months old? If she continues pushing, maybe that time can be shortened. "
622,"I was in a similar position as you, once upon a time.

My wife is tall and thin, with naturally small breasts.  She had always wanted bigger breasts, but I was rather meh about augmentation.  I was honest about giving her my opinion, but then I said that I would support her, either way.\

After having three kids, her mid-section was all messed up in ways that I can't describe because I am not that good of a writer.  She decided to have surgery to fix both her mid-section and to enlarge her breasts.

I decided to tell her the truth (that I thought her breasts were fine as is) but yet I still supported her fully as she went through the process.  For example, I was an active participant as she discussed the surgeries with the doctor and I helped her pick a pair of implants that fit her body.  She wanted to go much bigger than what I thought was attractive for her body.

When it is all said and done, she is very happy that she had them done and I enjoy them too (more than I thought that I would).  I am definitely glad that I talked her out of going with larger implants, as she looks plenty busty now... such that bigger breasts would look fake/unnatural."

624,"The first rule of self defense is to run away and get help.  You're right and your friends are men who have never had to worry about what it's like to be in a fight with someone who is probably significantly larger and stronger than you.  

What if Ana hadn't run away? She could have gotten her ass beat right along side you, and you'd both be lying dead in a proverbial ditch.  

My google-fu is failing me now, but a few years ago, I saw a gofundme for a brain damaged lesbian who was attacked while on a date, late at night, with her partner.  The partner died from her wounds in the beating they both took.  I think they may have both been raped?  

When your male friends fear violence based their gender and sexuality, they can get an opinion.  "
625,"Phenomenal advice. I'd just tack on for OP to also take a breath. You've been through the ringer, and look at yourself now. You have nothing to be ashamed about and so much to be proud of. If your boyfriend's parents are half the picture-perfect community leaders you describe...then empathy, kindness, and respect shouldn't be too much for you to expect. Nothing you've said makes them sound like you should be afraid they'll jump to conclusions or be cruel. Unless they're only serving the community to be condescending (unlikely, given your glowing description), then give his parents a chance to impress you. And give your boyfriend a chance to do the same by opening up about these insecurities."

The other day, &lt;event&gt; happened. I wanted to have this talk with you because I want to be the best partner I can and if I was in your position I'd be really worried*.""   
   
That way you get all the difficult stuff out in the open, and there's far less room for misinterpretation. Listen to the other posts here tho, don't expect them to believe you 100%, and don't try and over sell your story of what happened. Time will show them what kind of partner you are, and laying a foundation of trying to communicate will set you up in the right direction. "
628,"Woah... this is way out of line and you are not overreacting. I would lose my shit if my partner did this to me. He is being intentionally obtuse. 

Not that big of a deal? You pick the guy your husband is most insecure about and say “what if I told you that I had met up with Johnny twice before without telling you? Would you think I didn’t tell you on purpose?” 

He is 100% into her and I’m not really sure why she met up with him. She definitely knows he’s into her. If a married man posted hearts on my photos then asked me to meet up, I mean that’s pretty blatant. He got drunk before inviting her the 2nd time, so his inhibitions were lower. Liquid courage. 

Not cool not cool. I’m not sure what you should do. Maybe counseling. He needs to stop acting so fucking clueless though, you’re not an idiot. 

Catch him off guard and ask to read their messages. Either he already deleted them (guilty) or he will get real angry and defensive. "

630,"The saying that ""alcohol removes a person's inhibition and reveals their true self"" isn't necessarily true because a normal person has Inhibitions for a reason. Some people are happy drunks, others are bad drunks. Your boyfriend is the latter.

As long as he's serious and doesn't drink to that extent ever again, there should be no problem. Like I said. Alcohol may remove a person's inhibitions but that doesn't necessarily mean that is their true self."

636,"I was that girl in the group too. Admittedly, I am the ugliest in the group. When we would go to clubs, guys would dance with them or hit on them, but never really me. That kind of changed one night when we were all sat in a booth and a friend recognised a guy in the booth next to us. He came over to chat and despite being the ugliest girl in the club, he came, put his arm round me and we spoke most of the night whilst the others went off dancing and drinking. It was crazy that someone was interested in me. 

I saw him the following week, he remembered me (which felt weird because I'm the most forgettable one because everyone sees me as boring/gross) and flirted on and off all night. What I didn't really expect was the friend who initially got him to come over to us the first night started getting jealous and was drunkenly slurring and all over him, but he just brushed her off. It felt so odd for the roles to be reversed, for the first time in my life, I was getting attention  (which I think most can admit makes you feel good) rather than being the sad/jealous one watching on the sidelines.

I don't really have any advice, just that one day someone will come along and adore you. They'll look past everyone else and the 'conventionally pretty' type and just focus on you. In those moments, it's like it's just you two in the place, everything else fades into the background. Honestly, as rubbish as it sounds, it just takes time and someone will come along that thinks you're absolutely drop dead gorgeous. "
637,"It sounds like your wife is doing a really good thing by attending to her own emotional needs. It's not going to kill your daughter to entertain herself while her mom does that. It's *good* for kids to be bored and not entertained all the time. When they are entertained all the time, they never learn how to cope with boredom.

Perhaps your wife could have a little more balance between activities focused on her and activities focused on your child. But this does not sound like a huge problem. Your child will also be in school full-time within the next year, make friends, have playdates and do all of that stuff that you're talking about. "

To me, the time to START talking is when you and your partner need to work something out.  This is that time and he went the opposite way with it, ignoring you instead.

Unless his phone spontaneously died or he's out with no service, he should be talking to you about this instead of going radio silent.  His partner is in distress (reasonably so, because I would be too if I saw pics like that/put two and two together) and he's gone silent.  Not good."

This is a lot to process, I’m sorry. The fact that your sister kept it a secret for a year doesn’t make it any easier. Nothing like being blindsided that not only has she been dating him, they’re at the marriage point.

Your sister had to agree to a first date, knowing who he was. Then another, then another. She could have stopped at any point, she could have thought that I could get serious about this guy &amp; that would upset my sister. But she didn’t.

You owe them nothing, they shouldn’t have any expectations *at all*.

Personally, I’d tell them that from this moment forward, they don’t get to expect anything from me. Direct that to your sister. That you owe them nothing. That any indication that they’re ignoring your boundaries will mean full no contact, as in they’re dead to you. And that you’re no longer the scared teenage girl cornered in the darkroom, afraid that he sent the hockey team in to rape you, while he stayed in the background laughing. You’re not the young girl with red paint all over the back of her clothes, being ridiculed.
You recognize that everyone makes choices in their lives, &amp; that it’s not up to you to question them. You’re sorry that they chose to hide this from you, deliberately manipulating &amp; ostracizing you &amp; this situation for over a year, but you’re not surprised. 

You understand that they’ve decided to marry &amp; have a life together, &amp; you expect your involvement in their relationship to be about the same as it was over the last year. That you’re not sure if they have some fantasy about you three being friends, but to expect nothing. Expect nothing of you for the engagement, at the wedding, during their marriage, involvement with their future kids.

OP, you sound very together &amp; analytical about this. I get the impression you’ve done a lot of hard work in therapy. Remember you’re allowed to feel how you feel. You don’t owe anyone, let alone those two, any justifications or apologies for what you do.
Don’t give them any space in your head. They’re truly not worth it. I don’t know what your sister was/is thinking, the betrayal here is staggering. She chose the one man in the world guaranteed to cause nonstop drama with her sister. For a year, this has been going on, countless discussions &amp; her probably playing torn between the man she loves &amp; her sister. You don’t have to be a part of that drama.

Be clear, be concise. They’re adults, you have absolutely no say in what they do, decisions they make. You expect the same from them. You demand the same from them. You will not *ever* JADE to them.

Hugs, OP, I’m really sorry. They deserve each other.  :(

642,"I agree with u/Mabelisms and think it would be nice if she showed remorse, but find that answer neither here nor there as the reality of the situation is much weightier.

There is a reason you asked this question about something that happened years ago, and I would guess it is because of the affect lies have on people and where your imagination goes if this vitriol was ever turned your way.

Lies are so insidious because they increase the distance between our perception and reality. No one's perception ever lines up perfectly with reality, but lies, and incredible ones such as this go a long way in destroying people. You can't tell where the truth begins and ends and as a result you wonder what other lies have been told and could be told.

This may have been for revenge, but that's not the point. People do evil shit to people then try to pick and choose the consequences of their actions. ""I only hit you this hard so you can only hit me this hard back! Ow, you hit me too hard!!!"" This is why I don't fuck with people as much as possible because you never truly know how much you hurt them and how much they may retaliate.

That being said, your girlfriend's tendencies seem to lean more towards metaphorically throwing haymakers and taking bats to knees when someone pushes her in the sand. There are a million of ways she could have retaliated **IF** Monica did something wrong, but she chose this method and that should scare you to a certain degree. The ease in which she told such an incredible and ridiculous lie should also frighten you too.

You are her boyfriend and so there are few ways your relationship will most likely end, in a break up, marriage and divorce, or marriage and death. In 2 of 3 of those scenarios you are her opponent and as you can see she doesn't hold back.

You sure you want to stay in your position?"
643,"I wouldn't want to date someone who is also dating other people. It's a waste of my time, when I could be dating someone who actually cares about me. "
644,"&gt;She claims this has nothing to do with her finding chess boring, me having less time to see her or the fact that Chess is not 'cool'. She refuses to give me an actual reason, other than 'It's not worthwhile.'

I'm dubious about this. It would be one thing if she were upset about the fact that chess is going to take up the majority of your time for the next 3-5 months and she won't be able to see you as much as a result of that. I could dig that.

But she doesn't get to decide whether or not you find something to be worthwhile.

Stick with the chess."
645,"I don't think this is ""Date 1"" material, but it's definitely ""Full disclosure in a private setting before meeting the kids"" material."
646,"Compromise?

Take one shelf in the fridge for you, give one to her. Maybe once/twice a month go shopping together, buy some meats, pastas, etc and split the bill and put on third shelf.

I have found my best living situations, in this department, is being pretty generous with what you call staples. Milk, eggs, cheese, condiments, bread, rice, noodles, etc. I don't want to call my roomie to ask to use his mustard."
647,"Anxiety, left untreated, will control your life. It will prevent you from doing things that can enrich your life, hinder promotions, cut you off from friends. You should be honest about getting treatment. This trip could be a once in a lifetime opportunity- it would be a shame to waste it. "
648,"Stop picking up his stuff and be stubborn until he gets the message. Tell him you're his wife, not his mom, and you stay home to focus on the kids, not his messes."
649,"You need to be comfortable (or at least confidant) saying no. It's a life skill. If you can't say no to people you well end up in a lot of bad situations where you are taken advantage of over time. 

As others said, don't address past behavior. Just tell her no *every single time* now, ignore if she is pouty or tense or looks sad, and she'll catch on it no longer works with you eventually and stop asking. 

&gt;“Hey mind if I join you for breakfast?”. 

""Actually, I was really hoping for intimate meal with boyfriend"" (if you don't want her to sit down) or ""You're welcome to sit with us but the extra food is for me to eat later in the week so you'll have to make yourself something"" (if you just don't want her to eat your food). 

&gt;I was making tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for my boyfriend and I for dinner. Again, we obviously had plenty of soup, so she invited herself to sit down and eat our food with us.

First of all, don't acknowledged any hints and invite her. Don't serve her any soup. If she asks for some, say no. If you want it gentle ""Sorry, I'm saving the soup for later in the week. If you're interested I'd be happy to give you the recipe."" 

&gt; Lynn was trying coach him on how to make the cookies to her own liking (even though she was never offered any). 

Boyfriend: ""These are for OP and Friend, so I'm making them how my girlfriend will like them. But thanks for the advice about adding walnuts, I hope you get a chance to make yourself some cookies with walnuts soon.""

&gt;When he asked me and my friend if he could get us a bowl of ice cream Lynn immediately said “oooh yes I’ll have some” (again it was not offered to her”. She took the biggest scoop(s) and left hardly any for us. 

Boyfriend: ""Oh, I was talking to OP and Friend's name. Sorry if that was unclear."" 

&gt;Then when the cookies were baked she took HANDFULS of them. 

Boyfriend: ""Actually, I made these for OP and Friend's Name since she's having a hard day."" 

If she ever just takes your food or helps herself, I'd go with an indignant ""Excuse me?"" or a ""What are you doing?"" Make sure to get/take back anything she takes. "
650,"Your mother actually *did* get you a $120 gift:  *an excuse*

The next time she asks you to front her some money for something, you can tell her, ""no, because you still owe me $120 from the last time.""  She probably will never pay you, but she will also learn quickly not to ask you for money any more."
651,"Don't be friendly; your relationship is professional. I recommend going and reading a lot of Ask A Manager--and maybe asking her a question. She's the best with issues like this!

You got this, sis."
652,I appreciate you for putting what I could not organize..
653,"It doesn't matter if the OP wears the dress every day or only whenever the commentariat thinks is a special enough occasion - the fact of the matter is that her boyfriend accidentally ripped it, then started swearing at her when she started crying.  That's pretty rude and he owes her an apology and remuneration.  "

656,"He's not coming up with a lie.

He is having fun with that girl and ignoring you. Perhaps even, ""well she found out, so who cares now"".

Liars dont take as much time as this to lie, he simply doesnt care right now. He might start caring again once shes out of his sight, but he might not. 

It could be he cheated and now considers himself single..to me, that is the way he is acting.

You can rail against the storm or become the storm."
657,"Essentially this man wants a yes or he’s not interested. I know he did mention therapy but it’s a lot of extremes out of nowhere. Who’s to say he didn’t cheat already and found that he wants more? He did mention that he wants to date and have a fling. 

I’m so sorry OP. Being a divorced woman myself and having been cheated on, i can tell you this is extremely difficult and hate that you have to go through this.

Don’t forget that sometimes people say a little truth to hide a bigger lie. "
658,I got about 10% through your post before thinking you need to break up.  Managed to get through to post only to confirm what I knew from the beginning.  This is way too much drama and you're putting way too much thought into this.  End this and move on.  
659,going to vegas when youre under 21 with a group of 21+ would be a huge drag... sorry

662,"Buddy, being deaf is harder than a pissed off girlfriend. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it.

She has absolutely no idea how deep your ear canal is. Never allow anyone without a medical degree and specialized tools to insert anything into your ear canal. The membrane is so thin, one flick will tear it, and you will be in hell."
663," Speaking as a guy who is okay with period sex, she is completely out of line. Some people don't like bodily fluids, it has nothing to do with misogyny. Should a person automatically be ok with having cum on them/in their mouth? Saliva? Urine? If you don't like it, you don't like it. "
664,"For some women if her periods are becoming irregular she would/could get birth control to regulate them and have a set schedule. 
Does she experience any intense cramping or anything while she’s on her period? (Because birth control can help that too). 
I’m not saying it isn’t a little weird but as a woman I know that there’s several reasons why I started taking the pill at 17, that had nothing to do with sexual things. 
Hope this helps a little! "
665,"Slowly stealing money from your partnership over the years and lying about your daily activities is also dishonest. This is about protecting yourself, your estate, and your children's futures. You need to speak to another lawyer, one who won't be biased and doesn't have a personal relationship with your and your wife. The need for hiring a PI is that you don't have any other way of figuring out what she is up to without tipping her off. "
666,"He deliberately picked the most hurtful things to say so that you’d be too shocked and upset to have a calm and respectful discussion about ending your relationship. Otherwise, you might have brought up awkward tidbits like ‘why would a man want to be with a girl 10 years younger than him?’ Or my favourite ‘oh my god, were you grooming this girl when she was 17? Do her parents know about this?!’.

He doesn’t want a partnership, he wants a girl who isn’t experienced enough to see all the red flags he’s waving. I’m so sorry he has hurt you, but I’m glad you’re now free of him."

One of my friends posted SIX SELFIES today, and they were all posted one by one, at various times today (not doing anything, like, not a selfie w/ a cute animal or something. Just.... her weird smirk). I'm like. Why. But she has a tracker, I know, and I don't want the drama lol"
670,Congrats! Is she now also getting help for her PTSD?
671,"You can’t prove a negative (you’re not cheating), and even if she “comes around” on this, she will still hold it against you. 

She doesn’t trust you, and why put up with that when you’ve done nothing wrong?"
672,"&gt; I noticed there was tension between us after that for a couple weeks, but then she started inviting herself to meals again.

She’s doing it on purpose. Consciously or unconsciously she’s acting towards a deliberate end. There is no subtle way to “hint” that you want her to stop. You have to come right out and say it: “Lynn, I’ve noticed we have kind of a weird dynamic going around food. From now on I’d prefer if you didn’t eat my food or join in at mealtimes with me. Let’s handle our meals separately. Thanks!”"
673,U should run as fast as u can from this guy.... “borderline violent”? Really? Hes sounds like a psycho.. run seriously run from this guy... 
674,"She should leave and live with you again, if possible.

Your mother can't report her for shit if she leaves, your mother is an adult not a child being neglected or an elder being abused. She can call 911 if she has an episode. Or not. Who cares anymore, she's abusive and your sister should just leave immediately. 

Your mom can contact social services rather than keeping her child as a house slave. "
675,"&gt; To be fair, she had help from a whole lot of people who had no reason to give a damn about their soap opera bullshit.

This is what really gets me about this story. They were presented even by Op's post proof time and time again that Callie was lying. But instead of making even minimal attempt to verify any of this before participating in a bullying campaign against some girl they didn't know, they just went along with it for months. 

GF might have been behind the campaign. But Op and everyone else are not guilt free. "
676,"OP excuses it as social awkwardness, but this whole conversation tells me that Lynn knows exactly what's going on, how it's awkward, and is choosing to try to manipulate some free food out of the situation anyways. "
677,"If he'd been sorry and it had been an accident, his immediate reaction would ALSO have been distress, panic, and freezing when he heard the rip. Like, ""Oh no! OH NO! I am so sorry!! Is it okay, can we fix it, I'm really sorry! I didn't mean to, It just came apart-"" etc.

Instead, he told you it wasn't important, your reaction wasn't rational, and essentially that he could do whatever he wanted with the dress, and you needed to deal with it.

What happened here was you communicated a boundary. He didn't like that. So he broke that boundary. KNOWING how important it was to you. In fact, that's why he did it. Then he didn't like that you reacted badly. You should have prioritized HIM over a stupid dress, and taking care of his needs.

Nope, nope, nope, nope. He did this on purpose. You communicated ""This is important to me"", so he went right for what you had said was important and destroyed it without a single apology. Then he got mad at you about it. 100% a huge deal breaker."
678,"But he is a saver.  He's got $35,000 more than many people."
679,"&gt;Is this the 4-year itch, or is something fundamentally wrong with the way we interact with each other?

There's something wrong with the way she interacts with YOU.

&gt;tl;dr girlfriend seems to be only caring about her needs, and can be rather spiteful and hurtful. What can I do to make the situation better?

Find a less spiteful and hurtful girlfriend.
"
680,I'm glad you stood up for her and everything that all the other comments have said. My additional issue/concern is why is it okay with the rest of your friends for him to act this way?  Is he like the general group douche bag or was this out of character for him?  Seems like a sensible group would distance themselves from a person such as this and not ignore his abusive behavior. Little disappointed in your friends 
681,"It sounds like your daughter has plenty of stimulation and doesn’t need her mother to plan special outings with her.  I don’t think your daughter’s developmental progress is at stake here. 

I think the thing that is at stake is your daughter’s relationship with her mother.  Your kid will become less socially dependent and want to do her own things with her own friends in a few years. If she doesn’t enjoy spending time with her mother at that point, it will be hard to change that dynamic. I don’t think mom needs to entertain the kid every minute that she spends with her, but I do think she should make sure that they do some special mother-daughter fun things together and build good memories.  

I also wouldn’t put too much weight on a 5 year old’s declaration of boredom.  Kids can be more cleverly manipulative than they get credit for, and who knows what she’s telling your wife in private about her outings with you. 

Anyway, I think you might approach it by telling your wife that you’ve been finding it really rewarding to get to do all this fun stuff with your daughter and get special bonding time.  Encourage her to do one special kid-centric outing with your daughter per month (edit: and if she’s already doing at least one kid outing per month, I think you should respect your wife’s stance on this).  It definitely doesn’t have to be twice per week, but it would really be a shame if she missed out on those kind of bonding opportunities entirely.  

And, like other people said, its fine for the kid to be bored sometimes.  Also, it sounds like you and your wife currently have a good system going, where you’re both getting breaks and living rich lives, and your kid has a good life as well.    "
682,"""My boyfriend got angry at me because when he behaved badly I didn't anticipate it and cover for him in advance.  To make my boyfriend happy I should expect him to behave badly and preemptively help him hide it.""

Diagnosis: Asshole.

Prescription: Breakup."
683,"Your brother is the common denominator for all of these mistakes and poor choices.  🙄 If I were you I’d disengage from your brother, his exes, his freaking drama.  You can’t stop him but you can stop participating.

If you’re not ready yet then you should encourage him to get a vasectomy so he stops making more babies he isn’t going to support or be there for."
684,"Seconding that — the biggest thing here is that it is *not ok for him to speak to you like that*. What you did to “provoke” him doesn’t matter. And you did nothing to provoke him, for the record; he had plenty of time to do laundry, but he chose to send that text not because of legitimate frustration at being prevented, but because it gave him some satisfaction to hurt you.

Depending on how normal scenarios like this are, this may be one of the classic “iceberg” posts, where one weird incident is actually just the surface layer of a horrifyingly dysfunctional relationship. That’s something you’ll have to investigate for yourself — ideally in individual therapy so you can learn to have healthy expectations of how you want to be treated, and in couple’s therapy if you honestly think your husband can learn to meet those expectations."
685,"Wow, thank you! That's actually very helpful and I never knew about that. I'm going to research more about it haha. That made a lot of things click for me."
686,"I mean, it’s not normal. And no dentist on earth would recommend this kind of dental care, or lack thereof. You can choose to mention to her the facts about neglecting teeth brushing (I’m sure it can be found online) and see if that makes her reconsider. But other than that, you can choose to break up, or accept it as something she doesn’t do and stay. It’s really your call."
687,"Your boyfriend is being a jackass. You did nothing wrong. He just wants to feel like he's always ""helping"" you, even if his help isn't at all helpful, and he thinks what he wants is more important than what you need. He whined and snapped at you when you said no thanks, and now he's trying to make his immature rudeness your fault.

Being in a relationship is supposed to make your life better, overall. Is he making your life better? Or is he just making you anxious all the time?"
688,"I honestly don't know how it's possible to move past something like this. You can't unhear what he said regardless of how he claims he meant it after the fact, and it's obviously still affecting you deeply.

It kinda sounds to me like you two are incompatible in some major ways. You have different attachment styles, he has some kind of erectile dysfunction but won't cut back on his porn consumption, and he wants you to just get over the incredibly hurtful thing he said because your feelings are inconvenient for him. 

I don't think I'd stay in a relationship like that. "
689,"OP, just talk to him. It sounds like your relationship is pretty strong. "
690,"Jesus christ, thank you. The armchair diagnosis thing across reddit is legitimately driving me up the wall.

The greatest irony about all the ''ADD diagnoses'' in this thread is that we're all literally on phones and tablets on reddit.

For what it's worth, I think your suggestion was an excellent one."
691,"Do not apologize  Everyone concerned -- your shouting friend and your other friends who have criticized you -- should be apologizing to you.

You were an ""upstander"" while everyone else stood by and watched someone be mistreated.   You might want to think more about why you are associating with people who wouldn't have a problem with that."
692,"It's only been two months, this relationship has barely even started and instead of being all over each other and enjoying the honeymoon stage, he's been flaky, he essentially stood you up repeatedly, he is blatantly and unapologetically disrespectful of your time and the fact that you have a life outside entertaining him... I think the message he's been sending you is clear: you're an exclusive fwb to him at best, and he only bothers with you when it suits him and he has nothing better to do, plus he clearly assumes you must have nothing better to do yourself. You should have ghosted *him* long ago, you can ghost him back now, better late than never. And when he reappears out of nowhere eventually, please don't respond, not even to call him out. "
693,LOL. I was expecting that she was going to say that she goes home because she hates to use the restroom at work!!
694,"Jesus man, have some self respect. She's betraying your relationship--repeatedly. This isn't a one-time mistake. It takes two people to salvage a broken relationship, and she has no intention to. She's staying with you because it's comfortable, and feels guilty because she knows her behavior is wrong. Stop letting yourself be used and find someone who will give back to the relationship."
695,"Don’t go for it. If the physical attraction isn’t there, neither of you will be happy. Other people have mentioned that he could change and become more attractive, but it’s a bad idea going into a relationship with the intention of changing someone.

Can you imagine if a guy asked you out and you found out his skin crawled at the thought of your fingers touching him? You’d be heartbroken.

Just enjoy your friendship with this guy. "
696,[deleted]
697,"First thing is call off the engagement and get refunds. 

Second thing is to end the relationship. You don’t want to be with someone who, at this point, isn’t sure that they want to be with you. Don’t wait for her to make up her mind; make the decision easy for her by removing yourself from being an option that she could choose. "
698,"Uh, so you really DON'T have an amazing relationship.  "
699,"He's being incredibly rude. He's is comparing your positions and he needs to stop. You need to tell him, if he's interested in your day he needs to ask about it and not ask about specific situations in your day right after he got finished bragging about his specific situations. He's being rude."
700,"She lives far away, and you are the parent of your child not her. Take everything she says with grain of out-dated salt.

&gt;“you keep talking. I have a limited amount of time with you here and you keep talking.”

Incredibly rude. I wouldn't respect her opinion on anything if that's how she treats you. Why would you want to take her advice on children then?? Do what you think is best. If she wants to interject again, shut her down and thanks but no thanks. "
701,"Yeah. A lot of people here are being really hard on this girl for being mad or for wearing it, but that's ridiculous. 

She shouldn't have to worry about her partner fucking up her stuff. They weren't having passionate sex, just kissing. My old boyfriend never ripped any of my clothes during sex because he knew how important they were to me. 

Breaking stuff happens. I broke one of my old boyfriend's wine glasses. You know what I did? I apologized and replaced it, because that's what you're fucking supposed to do. If I were OP's guy, I'd be looking at tons of seamstress shops to pay and get it taken care of."
702,[deleted]
703,"Every time he makes those comments, call him out on it, ""That's a rude thing to say"". Call him out on the behavior in front of his family stop taking the heat and letting him be rude to you. You tell him how you expect to be treated, and just because he apologizes later, you don't have to accept it. "
704,"Your boyfriend is angry because you allowed yourself and the home you share with him become involved in what may well have been criminal activity. He's quite right in pointing out that you don't live alone and you can't make that kind of decision unilaterally. What your friend was doing was very sketchy and holds potential consequences for both you and your boyfriend now that you've made yourself party to it.

So yeah, you're definitely in the wrong here. "
705,"My philosophy is that it's better to just break-up rather than take a break.  She even bluntly said that she is damn sure that it won't work out.

&gt; The more I know you, the more I can't stand you most of the time

&gt; you are still stupid enough to piss me off

Anyone who said this to me - boyfriend, friend, family - would be gone. "
706,"I'm sorry, but I think he has someone lined up - perhaps they are just friends now but he senses he can have more with her if he asks.

My fear is that this is going to lead to him resenting you for not letting him have his cake and eat it, too.  He wants to date but still maintain the moral high ground.  He wants to be single but with a safety net of a loving wife waiting for him at the end of the day.

You are right, it doesn't work like that.  Even in open marriages this has to be well thought out with a ton of rules in place.

But I don't think he wants that because nowhere does he say it's OK for you to also start dating other guys.  

This is all about him, his dick and his midlife crisis.  Nothing good is going to come from this.  I'm afraid he is going to convince himself that you owe him a hall pass because you weren't a virgin and then he is going to get new relationship energy and think he is in love with whatever piece he finds to have an affair with.

Protect yourself.  
"
707,"Let me get this straight.

Your money is mutual money and her money is her personal money. She spends her money and the mutual money, and gets bent out of shape when you want something nice. Correct?

You need your own bank account."
708,Very true. I will start doing that from now on. Thank you.
709,"Welcome to the end of the honeymoon phase. Time for serious talks. Knowing what you sort of now its time for REAL talk.

\-Kids - yes no how many etc

\-What sort of marriage do you want? Both working? One of you as a SAHP?

\-Does she expect you to convert/attend services with her?

\-IMPORTANT - Sex sex and more sex talk. Time to find out how knowledgeable she actually is. Not just the basics of tab a into slot b, but full comprehensive knowledge. 

etc.  The cat is out of the bag and there is no putting it back. So you talk. And talk. And talk some more. "
710,"&gt; I appreicate everything that you do. And all the support and interest you show in my passions.

Even his texts trying to get her back show his self-centeredness. Nothing about what he offers her, just ""I appreciate that you pay attention to my interests, and that keeps you in the running with these other women."" "
711,"He’s already managed to isolate her from anyone who would take her side in a fight.

OP, RUN."
712,[removed]
713,"&gt;No, she's never done anything like that.

That you know of. Do you carry it with you in the bathroom? Keep it under your pillow while you sleep?

Seriously, OP, like others have said, she would NOT react like that if she didn't go through your personal phone on the regularly. It just makes no sense for this reaction to completely come ""out of nowhere"". Most likely, she felt secure and happy in your relationship in part because she does regularly look through your phone, so she knows what you're up to. Seeing you have another phone means that you could be doing all sorts of things behind her back.

If you DO see her again/spend the night with her again, please try the following: change the password to your regular phone, and don't let her see what the new one is OR change it to thumbprint ID, if it has that capability. Don't mention to her, just do it, and see how she reactions. 

If she cares AT ALL, that will tell you a lot. "
714,"Sounds like you have a manipulative grandmother. My grandmother is similar. She makes comments about my appearance and my relationship and is also extremely judge mental about everything that doesn't concern her. She insulted me the last time I visited her and I hadn't talked to her for weeks after. She called me trying to guilt trip me for not talking to her. I wasn't phased by it. She honestly rarely crosses my mind when she acts like that. I'm not dependent on her for anything though. If you can, you should become less dependent on your grandmother. If you ignore her and distance yourself she will realise the manipulative nonsense doesn't work on you."
715,"Your grandma is an asshole and a manipulative boundary stomper. She wants to control you. You did not make her cry. She is crying because she can't control you right now and is using crying as a manipulation attempt to try to make you feel guilty to put you back under her control. 

Don't fall for her fake-ass crocodile tears. Tell her how it's going to be and if she can't respect your autonomy as a person, she doesn't really care about you."
716,"OP's BF: If I don't leave with OP to at least take her back to her car, and she has to go alone, I'll look like the selfish jerk I actually am to my friends, BUT, if I try to turn it around on her, I will alleviate any guilt I may feel for being a crap BF."
717,"&gt; Despite my anxiety, I still don’t think I’m wrong when I get upset about her confrontational behaviour in public.

You can get upset about whatever you want.

What she is doing is not wrong. And if you are taking your upset out on her or punishing her for it, it's *you* who is massively in the wrong.

You need to double down on therapy, and if  you can't stop dumping your problems on her, you might need to take a break.

&gt; She thinks this is compromise, and I do not.

It is. It is literally a compromise, and it's quite audacious for you to demand she puts up with shitty treatment in the first place.

You are free to accept whatever inconveniences you want. You are *not* free to demand others do as well."
718,"&gt;you don't owe someone you don't like a job reference

Actually, I think you owe them to *not* give a reference! The first rule of references is only agree to do one for a person you can recommend! If you don't think highly of the person, you would be doing them a *disservice* to be their reference."
719,"&gt; I feel slightly silly because the whole thing really isn't my business, but for some reason, I find myself questioning whether or not Tim is a good person.

It's not silly. One thing might not define a person, but that doesn't mean that you should also be okay with a single thing your friend did. People place different moral/ethical issues at different levels of importance. For you, cheating is an incredibly big deal. Tim doesn't have to be the worst person on Earth for you to not be okay with him.

FWIW personally I'm with you. Cheating is something I'd cut someone out of my life for because like you I simply don't want to associate myself with someone who'd willingly hurt someone they care about like that. I understand why people don't feel the same way and want to stay friends with them, but my boundaries on this issue are my own and no one else's.

Ultimately you'll have to figure out how big of a deal this is for you. If it's something you can move on from, there's nothing wrong with still being his friend. If it's something you're not okay with, nothing wrong with leaving him either. The only factor is how important is this one specific issue to you?"

728,"I've spent the last hour having this very talk. Getting all these comments motivated me to not let him stonewall me anymore.

This went very weirdly and I'm still trying to process it...he let me talk, which was at least a start, instead of insisting we table it ""for now."" I laid out all my concerns already mentioned on here. I asked specifically if he's got any thorough plan for this goal. I told him bluntly that publication won't just fall in his lap, there's work he has to do to get there.

The way he reacted to that was so strange that I'm worried he's extremely ignorant about the actual logistics of what he wants to do. He INSISTED that he ""will write a famous novel"" and that ""he'll take care of us for the rest of our lives."" He said right now is the ""price we way for greatness later."" When I asked HOW he plans to achieve that greatness, like what is your actual step by step plan, dude, he just kept talking on and on about how this book is like nothing that's ever been written before, it's ""inspired,"" and ""it will publish itself."" He seriously freaked me out when he said his ideas are ""alive"" and ""have the will to create themselves."" Everything I'm putting in quotes is directly what he said.

He has no idea, none whatsoever, about the work other people here have described that goes into being an author besides just the writing. 

This is so insanely romanticized and naive isn't it? I don't know what to do. I know next to nothing about novel writing and publishing but damn. It's like he's lost in a fantasy world.

I have a lot of serious thinking to do."
729,"Honestly, I would be kind of upset if a few days before my wedding the best man still had not bothered to figure out travel arrangements.  "
730,"I think when she does this you have to repeat the mantra in your head that "" choices have consequences"". I wonder if she is unhappy in her marriage. There are many things she could be doing to bring more into her life and she is not. You and your husband have to work in reframing this because she is not going to magically stop it."
731," If it were me, I would want to know.  I was in a similar situation with an ex who cheated and the girl he cheated on me with contacted me and said she knew he was with me but he told her we were broken up and she believed it but we were in fact still together.  I'm still friends with that girl and have not contacted him since I broke up with him.  She came to you and was like ""hey check this shit"" she seems like the kind of person that would want a heads up if he was up to it again. "
732,"&gt;instead of just wandering off and having an affair like most people, he brought up his issues with you directly and then backed off


it's true, but, on the other side, this would make me wonder forever if he went through with it behind my back. it's not only hurtful, it's a paranoia that maybe will never go away"
733,"""How can I get him to notice me again and just appreciate that he already has a beautiful women standing right next to him?""


You can't. He has 0 respect for you. Youre not even a person to him anymore. You just exist for him to play with when he's horny. My ex said the EXACT same thing your fiance did. It was always my problem not his. I had to work on it. He could not stop. He was even looking at other women online when he was sitting across from my mom. 😡"

I see it as a lack of mindfulness, especially if you said please be careful about my dress and have explained how much you love the dress. 

I treat things well and am careful not to break or damage them. I used to have a friend who would borrow my things and return them damaged so I stopped letting her use my stuff. 

It’s a difference in personality, and for me I’m not compatible with people who damage things habitually. "

739,"This is the sort of thing you should tell your partner earlier than later, because it is potentially a HUGE compatibility issue.

Honestly, it's the sort of thing that you should have done before hitting 2 years. Before you settled into a serious relationship.

"
742,"Your very first sentence literally describes the problem:

&gt;My older-brother figure best friend doesn't approve of my boyfriend **because he doesn't like how fast we got together.**

Full stop. Who the hell is he that he gets to determine what speed your dating life goes at? You are an adult sharing good news (yay, I'm dating!) with a *friend*, not a middle-schooler asking their parents for permission to go to a movie with a boy.

**Yes** your boyfriend is right to be upset and concerned, I would be too.

**Yes** this ""friend"" almost certainly has a huge crush on you, and if he somehow doesn't then he's still **massively** overstepping his boundaries.

**No** you are not going to find a partner who is ok with you having another man in your life who gets pissy/offended/""has a problem"" with *how and when you decide to date.*

The TLDR? This is none of your friends business, and the fact that he thinks it is combined with his negative reaction says he has a very warped and unhealthy view of what your friendship means, and you are allowing him to do that, making your boyfriend (rightfully) uncomfortable.

You need to step in and enforce boundaries with your ""friend"" immediately. He gets **no** say or input on your romantic life unless you specifically invite him to provide feedback."
743,"If it’s just for 2 years, would it be possible for him to move? I mean taking a job somewhere else for 2 years wouldn’t look that bad on a resume (perfectly normal in fact) and easily explainable. You guys have done long distance before, and as someone who just closed the distance in an ldr I would be hesitant to go back but for an opportunity like this both of us would understand if the other wanted/had to go."
744,"Don’t let someone hold you hostage to save yourself some embarrassment. End the relationship. If you truly believe he’ll tell your parents, maybe preemptively tell them yourself. Let them know that you owned your mistake, took the necessary steps to correct it, and what you do now to prevent it from happening again. It may not be an easy conversation, but it’s gotta be easier than staying in a toxic, manipulative relationship. "
745,You are not being petty.   He definitely needs to follow through on therapy and you should both go to couples counseling so you have a space where you can talk about how hurtful this request is.

748,"Seems like almost everyone on Reddit seems to think that snooping is the worst thing ever, but I think if your partner is a lying scumbag who has shown that he can't be trusted, snooping is pretty understandable.

749,He badgers you for sex until you give in and you don’t enjoy it. That is sexual coercion. Run. You don’t want a platonic anything with a person like that.
750,"&gt;Recently my boyfriend has started complaining (and even moping) about how much sex we have, saying ""he had expected more [sex] from a relationship"".

Tell him to get a hotel room or find his own place.

&gt;He has been trying to get me to have sex with him in places I don't feel comfortable having sex (like the beach, on my friends couch, when we were taking a walk through the woods) and when I tell him no he mopes so normally I give in.

Ok, he's an asshole who pressures you into sex you're not comfortable having.  Gross.

&gt;I do not enjoy having sex with him, because after were done he just rolls off of me and I end up feeling used.

Double gross.  You shouldn't put up with that.  You can find someone else who satisfies your platonic needs _and_ isn't an asshole about sex, too."
751,"Regardless of whether or not cheating actually happened, he lied at some level and is not concerned with your justified anxiety since. I think you need to consider whether you want to be with someone who doesn’t prioritize your feelings."

Honestly, so many people who come here seem to need to be told this."
753,"You have clear set boundaries of not getting involved and have been encouraging her to get mental help and not pulling any punches when it comes to telling her that her behaviour is not normal or healthy. That's pretty much textbook what you should do. You're doing great. 

Ultimately she's the only one who can help herself. Even if she was forced into therapy, nothing can make her participate in any meaningful way. She needs to be open to accepting help before anything can work. And right now she's not.

Are there people around her you could mention your concerns to? friends and family who are physically close to her can keep an eye out for her becoming dangerous to herself and others much more easily, and can help encourage her towards professional help."

755,"Oh, this was not a one-time thing? I think once the immediate situation is resolved, your husband should have a conversation with his parents and explain that while your parents appreciate that his parents want to show their gratitude, it would be more polite for them to use the money to treat everyone to an experience. A day out on a sailboat, a spa day for your mom and your mother-in-law, a trip to a local winery, something like that.  "

757,"&gt;I’m worried about how he’ll react to whatever I say since he’s clearly okay with following someone in the first place

Then bring a friend with you. Tell him it's not cool and end the friendship. I don't think you're under reacting. That's actually freaky when you combine it with his other behavior."

759,"You still don't appear to have actually set any firm boundaries yet. 



Send a text/ email stating what you want her to do when interacting with you, and spell out what the consequences will be if she ignores those instructions. 

E.g. ""You are not currently welcome in our home.  I will let you know if that changes in the future. If you show up unannounced, we will not open the door. If you refuse to leave, we will call the police""

Or

""We do not want you to buy anything for our home.  If you do, it will be immediately donated or trashed""

Or

""Please do not insult me.  If you insult me again, i will leave/hang-up/ have to ask you to leave. ""

Think about the behaviors you don't want and then come up with consequences for each. 

Then TELL her about your new boundary.

If she crosses the boundary, follow through with the consequence.

760,"**Run, run far away.**

No one should try to pressure you into sex, that he went to these extremes shows this isn't just someone who made a mistake without realizing, he was intentionally manipulative - this is a HUGE RED FLAG.

You have a lot to be proud of, and I bet your BF is proud of you too.  If someone brings up the past, just be cool and let that stuff slide right off.  You don't need to explain anything.  If you haven't already, have a talk with your BF and tell him how you're feeling and ask him to support you and come to your rescue if you need it.  He'll probably do that anyway without your needing to ask.

774,"That's the first thing that jumped to my mind. But, for the five years that I have been dating him, I have never once got a hint that he was still into his ex. He's dated multiple people since, she's also dated multiple people since, and the only time they really communicate is when he comes back and visits his old friends from his home country.

I think she has to bring this up, and make it easier to get her father to understand the problem by taking the money off the table first - telling him not only is she not asking but would not accept it, and then tell him she'll need some time away if he can't remember when he affirm his middle daughter's worth."

793,"When I had an issue with a neighbor who was stalking me, I went to the police expecting to have to defend every single accusation with proof and times and dates. I had been involved in one case of domestic violence 15 years back and remember the police officer asking me, ""Now what could you have done to deescalate his anger?"" (when my dad beat the shit out of me). So my guard was way up and I was sorta ready for a battle to be believed.  Instead I got a female sergeant who told me, ""I think this guy sounds dangerous and here's what I would do if I were you..."" And she went through all my options and never once acted as though I was being histrionic or overreacting. 

So I did as she advised, kept documenting, and took it to court. At the court date the neighbor brought a lawyer and the works to try to discredit me. The judge straight up asked him, ""Why are you fighting this order, and want to remain in contact with this woman?"" He could barley sputter a reply. It was such a monumental moment. 

Oh and I was given more protection than I asked for initially in my order. 

WA State, King County Court system. I expected to be treated as a joke and I was actually given protection. 

But I don't know if I would have taken it all the way if I wasn't believed during that initial police contact. To have a woman in power look across the table from me, and decide to run a quick background check on him, because she was genuinely concerned about my welfare has changed the way I think about police and my own protection. "
794,"It’s definitely problematic that she is not a safe driver and is in denial about it. I wouldn’t feel at all comfortable driving with a person who has such a tendency to get in frequent accidents. I think six accidents in five years speaks for itself here. 


But as a side note, I do just want to mention that you can get a speeding ticket for speeding even if you are just “matching the flow of traffic”. I personally try not to speed even if others around me are doing so, because I’ve fallen into that trap before and ended up with a ticket. So I wouldn’t hold that part against her. 

"
795,"&gt; His family and friends always tell me that his life is a lot better since he's met me

This line stood out to me, because it raises a really important counter-question: is *your* life better since you met him? I've been in a similar situation to you in regards to weight struggles-- I lost a bunch of weight over the course of two years and lately started putting some of it back on. My boyfriend, who met me when I was close to my lowest weight, has mentioned it a total of one time, and that was because I brought it up first. All he said was ""I've noticed your weight gain has been bothering you, and you've turned into a bit of a shrinking violet, if you need help getting back on track I'll do whatever I can to help."" That's the correct response. Your boyfriend criticizing you, belittling you and your struggles, and making you feel like shit is not the correct response. 

I don't want to make assumptions about your relationship, but if I had to guess I would say that your weight isn't the only issue he acts like this about. Honestly, if I was ever dating someone and they told me that they didn't know why they were with me, even in the heat of an argument, I'd be out of there. You're young, and there are so many guys out there who are going to treat you better than this and who will find you attractive and beautiful in ways that your boyfriend apparently doesn't. "

798,"You should have already brought this up frankly.

This is a deal breaker for you, and something that needs to be addressed early in relationships.  At this point, since you are already meeting family, this will be a more serious conversation.  This is a relationship-ending topic and you put that off and you both got invested....so now there is a high likelihood that she's going to be really hurt by this.

In the future....this doesn't have to be a bid deal.  Its something to mention early on, before anyone gets invested.  It doesn't have to be intense, just a :  i don't ever want kids, where do you stand?  "
799,"That’s a great suggestion, I’ll definitely pass it on!! 

My in-laws have stayed in this house twice in the past and both times left cash but never this much.

What you have laid out seems fair and you said that you both discussed that it was shared so I agree with you on the fact that spending a little below half of it on a suit is okay because it’s your half.

It doesn't sound like Black women don't like you, it just sounds like you don't live somewhere that Black women live or hang out where PoC are.  I'd say the title is kinda miss leading.... 

Join meet up groups maybe?  Volunteer or join a sports team? You cant meet women you like is they aren't around. You have to go looking  "

803,"ha!  you're not too far off.  when I lived in said cabin (alone, during grad school, with no internet or TV - those were some dark and wonderfully melancholy years), I remember sort of looking at the mouse poop on the kitchen counter and being like ""well, sorry guys, we were living in harmony, but now I've got to start murdering you."""

Thank you! My b-day present to myself is a class at the local community college (I am working towards getting a B.A. one day) and loved the writing/English courses. 

&gt;  have a feeling his parents are gonna be kind and gracious   


  
I really hope so. So many rumors swirled that I'm not even sure I know all of them. It's embarrassing and I hope to them it's a forgotten memory.

806,"Most abusers come off as charming, likeable, and reasonable to those outside of their abusive relationship. This is extremely common. 

People can be one way with some people and another way to others. 

Something victims often experience is something you’re most likely experiencing right now, and  it’s called cognitive dissonance. It’s when two strongly held beliefs exist at the same time in the mind - and their contradictory nature causes extreme confusion, or lapses in judgment. ie: « he is my friend, I know him »  vs  « that was horrible and extremely wrong, maybe I don’t know him at all »

Victims often experience the same thing, but magnified to a thousand. « This is the person I am in love with, and trust the most » vs « this person is purposely hurting me »  

These two concepts are fighting for dominance in the mind, and are so opposite and conflicting, and the victim naturally wants the good reality to be true, so they deny the reality of the abuse altogether, even to themselves. Often they start to believe their abuser when they tell them they deserve it, or they’re stupid, or selfish, or worthless. It’s a form of brain washing. That’s what emotional abuse is. It’s total control over another person. 

Statistically, ALL physically abusive relationships start as emotionally abusive ones. Not all emotionally abusive relationships become physically violent, but abuse predominantly tends to escalate unless the victim removes themselves from the relationship. 

You did the right thing. 

Take some time away from the group. Take some time to see it at a distance. Try not to engage in making excuses for your friend, and try not to engage the group in arguments about it. 

You know what you did was right. We know what you did was right. And she may not know it right now, but she will one day know what you did was right, too.

807,"He blows his nose for an hour in the bathroom and gets blood everywhere? Sorry but I don’t think he’s just blowing his nose, read between the lines...."
808,"No, absolutely do not address past events. Your chance to address those was at the time they happened, and that time has now passed. Plus there wouldn't have been past events if you'd have said no to begin with, so kinda unfair to her to bring it up now. Just tell her your wants moving forward."
809,"Depending what it was like to deal with you as an addict they might not forget for a very long time, if ever. 

It feels like a long time for you because of how hard it has been emotionally and physically, good on you for sticking to it.

But I would point out that even in this comment thread you are talking about a recent relapse that they know nothing about which is effectively lying by omission. 

That among other things you've said shows me that you're still not looking at this from the angle of you messed up and need to accept that these things take actual time, you want the ""rewards"" of sobriety on your timeline and that is not how these things work.

Regarding your sister  - Keep working on you and give her the space she needs. 

Also cut the victim stuff out now. 

Your brother in law is trying to protect his family, he may not be being nice about it but in his mind you are a threat and he has the right to do what he thinks is fair to exclude known threats from his kid's life. 

Focus on what you can do to show you've actually changed and are no longer a threat. Focus on living your life free of drugs and when people are ready to let you back in be aware you may need to keep working to maintain relationships (again depending on how badly you breached their trust in the past). "
810,"Just so you know. A women just died in Brasil killed by her husband. She was a lawyer and quite successful. He used to beat her in the elevator of the building they lived in. The neighbours said they heard her scream all the time but never did anything because "" you shouldn't get between a couple"". Also all her family and friends saw that he treated her like shit and never said a word. 

I am not saying your friend beats his grilfriend. All I am saying is you are braver than most and  thank you for standing up for her. "
811,"Reading these comments, I realize that this will probably be a great experience and I know I need to get help, but I don't know how to ask for it.

Be yourself, join clubs, do sports, create and LEARN. Education is where you are most likely to develop a strong personal identity as your schooling will lead you into a defining career. "

816,"This is a case of abuse, for sure. You just know when these posts start off with any variation of  “I am not a smart person”. Obviously OP’s self esteem has been ruined. And the fact that the husband would text that.. Jesus Christ. OP, I hope you can find a way out of this relationship, it doesn’t sound healthy for you or your daughter."
817,"Hi.  I'm just going to list some quick thoughts for you here.  Anecdotally, I married someone quickly, my parents tried to tell me it was the wrong decision or hasty at least and it fell on deaf ears.  Looking back, it was all pretty obviously dumb so I figured I have at least a frame of reference for some of your situation. 

&gt;
&gt;[We] have separate recovery programs, in order to avoid taking the other person down with us if one of us does relapse.
&gt;

Perfect!  Sounds smart. 

&gt;Simon is 11 years older than me, has a criminal record, an ex wife and an estranged teenage daughter.
&gt;

Yikes, ok, maybe I'm on mom's side.
&gt;
&gt;all they know is his criminal record. They haven’t had a chance to see what he’s currently doing with his life, only what comes up when you Google him.
&gt;

I think it begs asking, what exactly is his record for?  My thought is it must be serious for it to be popping up through a simple Google search. 

&gt; a breakup was implied. 
&gt;

I agree your mother's method seems a little overbearing, but imo *most* parents do usually have their kids interests at heart.  How has your relationship been with her in the past?  Have you spoken with her directly about your concerns?  Is she worried about you relapsing because he was also an alcoholic or is this more about his criminal background?  What about the age difference? 

&gt;My plan right now is to just take all the cash I have saved and mail it to her, but not have any other communication. 
&gt;

I think this might be rash.  I would talk to her and try to find the root cause for her concern.  Again this depends on how your relationship has been with her in the past.  In my situation, my parents had always been there for me but I was so in the moment I thought they were just being biased.  In hindsight they were concerned for good reason and a few years later I've finally gotten through divorce proceedings and found someone better suited for me and my future.  Good luck to ya!
"
818,"That’s understandable, but I just want to emphasize that a medical career is going to include a whole series of very important tests - beginning with Step 1 and basically never finishing, because you have to recertify every so many years.

Which is to say, your BF is going to have to find a way to handle high-stakes test taking.

Looks like you found some good strategies the last couple weeks; hopefully that can continue into the future."
819,"There was a post here a few months ago about a women who told her BIL that her sister had cheated on him. She didn’t have anything to back up her claims as the cheating was well in the past and the sister had given no details about it. The BIL didn’t believe the OP based on so little evidence. The sister of course found out and cut her out of her life, but also badmouthed the OP to the rest of the family. Essentially the poster was asking for advice on how to deal with her whole family thinking she is a liar and trouble maker.

The overwhelming consensus of the commentators was that the OP had been thoughtless and meddlesome for telling her BIL. That she had absolutly nothing to support her claims, wasn’t that close to her family, and was somewhat sanctimonious made people have less sympathy for her. It was sometimes pointed out how different the comments were from posts were the OP asks wheter or not they should tell on someone they know is cheating, and the commentors mostly replied again with how little evidence she had and not being close to the family and all this was different. But some also ackowledge that people on reddit tends to hate cheaters and want them to get their comeupance, and that can drive them more than concern for the OP.

Right now many commentors are telling you about morals and that you should be enpathic towards your BIL. But with that other post in mind I want to give you another perspective; what would the consequences be for you? If your BIL didn’t believe you, if your sister found out you told on her, if your family got different stories from you and your sister about what happened, then how would it effect your life?

That doesn’t mean you can’t tell your BIL if you believe that it’s the right thing to do, but that you have to be very careful and smart about how you do it.

The standard advice is to give news such as this anonymously. You would need to decide on a method of communication that helps you stay anonymous but also what to write that doesn’t reveal to much about who wrote it. Right now you, your sisters friend, and her one night stand are the only ones that know, and concealing your identity is necessary to not make it completly obvious that it’s you. Assume that whatever you write BIL is going to show your sister.

You also need to give BIL as much info as possible so that he can use it to question and confirm. He needs to know at the minimum what date the cheating took place, but that the friend was present and knows is also important info.

This is no easy thing to deal with for anyone. Moral beliefs do play a part in how you want to continue, but so does self care. As a ninteen year old I would assume you are very much dependent on your family still, and that means family drama that comes from accusing your sister of cheating can have real consequences on your life. That is something to take into consideration too in how you decide to move foreward. Good luck!"
820,"&gt;How do I get him to change his driving behavior?

Unfortunately you can't. You can't *make* someone change. They can only change when they want to and your BF made it very clear he doesn't want to.

From a third party perspective it sounds like you're dating someone who's a danger to others, doesn't care that he's a danger to others, and never had to face consequences for his actions. That's not the personality profile of a mature person or someone that'd be conducive to a healthy long term relationship.

I'd seriously consider getting out. I'd understand if he was simply a bad driver. That can be fixed through additional lessons, defensive driving courses, etc. But him blowing you off, him purposely choosing to drive recklessly, and his family covering for all of his stupid actions? Not good."
821,"He sounds like he's in the grips of a manic episode. Does he have a history of mental illness? The things he's saying are far, far beyond romanticized and naive, they are insane.

&gt; He seriously freaked me out when he said his ideas are ""alive"" and ""have the will to create themselves."" 

Seriously, this is *scary*. Are you able to contact his family?
"
822,"Then if hes agreeing to her levels of control, theres not much you can do. I would definitely though as a unified group (you and all the people in your friend group) agree to pass along the message I gave you or something similar to him, so he knows where you all stand. In the end, he may decide to go with his girlfriend over all of his friends (love is blinding sometimes). If that's the case, just say you understand and to reach out when or if he ever becomes ready to hang out with the group without her. It may be months or over a year before he does, but he will. Likely when the relationship blows up again. At that point, take him back into the fold so to speak and support him through that. "
823,Let her tell his wife. It won't go how she thinks it will.
824,"You do nothing. It's up to her to stand up to her parents. If she refuses to ever do so, it may be time to move on from this relationship. "
825,"I would reply advising her not to come visit.  You will not have the time to entertain her  If she does come to (your area), you recommend (hotel X) and (solo activity Z).  "
826,"Whatever kind of person Monica is, Callie did something very cruel."
827,"You're incompatible. You don't have to do everything together, but you should both respect each other's wants and needs, and that goes both ways. In that yes, you should respect the fact that he likes staying in more than you do, BUT he should respect the fact that you want to go out, and being in a relationship means spending time together at least sometimes! 

Couple his utter disinterest with the fact that he gets shitty if you don't invite him, plus what sounds like gaslighting you about birthday plans, or at the least not listening to you, and I've got to start wondering why you're even together, from either of your perspective! Because you shouldn't be putting up with his childish attitude, and he doesn't sound like he even wants a girlfriend, he just wants to be left alone forever."
828,"Run. 

That's what you do. Run like the wind. "
829,[deleted]
830,"&gt;  I have decided I’m going to start doing is using the boyfriend card.

Don't use the boyfriend card.  You think it's saying ""I have boyfriend, so no chance for you"" they think you're saying ""I have a boyfriend, but I'd date you if I didn't"".

That'll just get losers orbiting you waiting for you to 'break up' so they can have their chance."
831,OP's mom sounds like she could tell us a bunch of stories over in JustNoMIL.
832,"Agree 100%. She felt secure because she knows what's on your personal phone, and the work phone threw that out the window. "
833,"If a partner taunted me like that I'd dump them on the spot. Seriously, that phrasing is so incredibly disrespectful I would consider it a dealbreaker. Does he always compete with you like this? It sounds like you havent shut him down. You should. HARD! Every time he teases you about this you should call him out immediately and not back down (or just dump him cause he sounds awful)."
834,"Ignore her. She is being extremely selfish, and weirdly judgemental about this *long-standing interest* of yours. Don't give up something you love for someone you've been dating for two months. It's not worth it."
835,This would have become an even bigger issue for you two down the road. You absolutely made the right choice. 
836,"Is it possible that you are not your father's biological child?  The focus on appearance,  the favouritism of your sister...  Regardless it's not your fault and it sucks that you're in this position."
837,"&gt; He said he'd give me money to destroy it. We agreed on $100 (it probably could have been pawned for the same). 

This sounds like a pretty unhealthy dynamic."
838,"Holy shit, I didn’t see those comments. OP is definitely in danger and needs to get out of there. Threats of murder-suicide should be taken seriously. "
839,"&gt; I feel heartbroken even though he didn't actually do anything


He did plenty. Is the worst part of your husband cheating someone touching his dick? Or is it him wanting to cheat and threatening you with it. "
840,You can mute now‽ Praise be!
841,"I'm the same way. I had to tell a girl in clinic that ""it is EXTREMELY unlikely that you got this from anywhere except your boyfriend."" But she told me her boyfriend cried a lot, and he never cries, so she believes him. Poor girl. Dude definitely cheated. "
842,"It's not that he lacked ambition but moreso that he doesn't play ball.

Refusing low paid work when you're qualified for more is one thing.

Believing you're above entry level work when you still need to pay for your dues is stupidity masquerading as ego. "
843,"How about the compromise is that instead of expecting her to go along with your extreme self-effacing behaviour, she gets to ""confront"" people if she does it politely?

Stuck behind annoying couple ""excuse us can we just get past you?"""
844,"I’m going to be totally honest with you, this might very well have to be a choice between your marriage and this opportunity. You’re going to have to do some deep thinking and really figure out which one means more to you. Either option is a valid one, but I don’t think you’ll be able to have your cake and eat it too in the scenario. "
845,"&gt;  Flakey is annoying but this person is important to your partner.

This might be a bit of a stretch, but they're Italian. Her being flakey and disorganised likely isn't seen as *that* big of a deal since, afaik (from living on the Mediterranean myself), last minute changes and people being late in general is pretty common."
846,"She doesn't need a $500 per night hotel. But Jesus, dude, you need to stop assuming you make the decisions and are in charge because you make more money. If you show your wife the same contempt and disdain for her that you're showing us, no wonder she's pushing so hard for this- she probably feels like she has no voice in the relationship, because you can always pull the ""I make way more money than you, what I say goes"" card. 




Also, as an aside- say you spend the $500 per night. It's a two week vacation, so that's $7000 on hotels. Your flights are probably around $5000, if you're flying business class. $3000 for meals and discretionary spending, puts this vacation at less than 3% of your gross combined income. I don't know what your household expenses are like, but that does not unreasonable to me.
"
847,"First question... Is she on birth control? My wife's birth control kills her sex Drive, and when she's off it, she's a different person. 

Second, to answer your question ""is it worth it?"". The answer is a resounding ""maybe"".. To some, it is for sure.. To others, they realize it was a ""grass is greener"" syndrome. 

At this point in your relation though, it's worth long discussions and probably counselling before breaking it off"
848," I think that's exactly what she was doing. 

&gt; When someone is being annoying in public (think, blocking a hallways/pathway/trail, being loud or obnoxious in a public space, cutting her off, etc) she likes to let them know they shouldn't be dong X and ask them to stop. 

From my reading of the post, I think she was saying things such as ""Excuse me, this is a shared space -- would you use headphones for your music so we don't all have to hear it?"" OP sees this as confrontational and blunt... but OP is also someone who repeatedly **crosses back and forth across streets** to avoid meeting other pedestrians in the sidewalk.   


OP's spinelessness is an inconvenience for anyone who has to spend time around him -- namely his girlfriend."
849,"Then he gets off on being a martyr. 

I'd extricate myself from this guy if I were you.

His life calling seems to be ""sanctimonious doormat"".

Do him a favor, though.

Be excruciatingly honest when you break up with him as to why."
850,"So to clarify, this guy:

- Started dating a teenager when he was 25
- Seems totally fine with his friend being a habitual cheater
- (At the very least) tried to cheat in the beginning of your relationship
- Got an STI test 5 months into a monogamous relationship, even though both you and he were clean when the relationship started

Not only that, but you've got a dead bedroom, and you fight all the time.

*Why* are you in this relationship exactly? What are you getting out of it? Do you see a future with this man?

Just remember - this isn't a court of law, you don't need to *prove* or *argue* your way out of a relationship. Breaking up is a unilateral decision, you can do it at any time.

For example, when the relationship is already doing poorly, and you discover evidence that he attempted to cheat on you, or maybe actually did. That's a great time to leave."
851,"Yep. My verbally abusive ex was like this. He would throw fits and lash out at me and the angriest he ever got was when I was hiding in the bathroom (literally afraid of him because he was having one of his screaming fits at some minor transgression he decided I'd committed) and I called my friend crying and asked her to pick me up. He spent months berating me for that, for letting someone else know how he treated me. That was supposed to be our secret. He was Mr. Nice Guy to the rest of the world. Couldn't have them knowing how he spoke to his gf when no one was watching. After that, I wasn't allowed to hang out with that friend because she knew what he really was. I eventually got up the nerve to leave him and then (being young and stupid, I was actually around OP's age), I tried being ""friends"" with him (just why?). One night we were hanging out and he looked at me and told me that we could only get back together if I cut that friend from my life again. And I thought, hold the fucking phone, who said I'm getting back together with you? For the first time I saw the red flag and realized it. I made an excuse to leave (so he wouldn't realize how pissed I was because deep down I was still scared of his outbursts). Then when I got home I texted him that I was choosing my friend, and never wanted to talk to him again (and blocked him). Felt real good."
852,"You got it, he’s just jealous of your job. 

Is he happy with his career? 

I don’t want to make any assumptions, but he could be very frustrated about his job, and is taking that frustration out on you, which is not okay- but we’re all guilty of taking out frustration on our partner at some point or another.

"
853,"&gt; Is it possible that her behaviour is not so much about your housing situation, but about the time line for starting a family? 

Considering she is literally saying ""we're never going to have a family"" while sobbing all weekend, this is the obvious problem. I'm not sure if everyone just glossed over that line or what, but it's clearly the root cause here. "
854,"He is ending this relationship because you stood up for yourself, not because you “experience the world differently” because you are more introverted! There’s nothing wrong with you being more quiet than him...

He realized that you were setting boundaries and not letting him walk all over you and use you for your money and it stopped being fun for him, so he made it about you instead of his faults"
855,"It stopped being unintentional when he started making it a competition. Got sushi for free? Great! Why is there a need to ask if you also got free food. Got free stuff? Great! Why are you asking if she got free swag? 


The comments are all intentional. It's hard to be happy for someone who is trying to one-up you all the time. "
856,"&gt; Why would you let your kids be so disrespectful, judgmental and ignorant in YOUR house?

i'm guessing she always has and now it's come back to bite her."
857,"&gt;He says he would rather us both dead than me to leave him

This phrase is not common and should be taken as a serious threat."
858,"Was gunna say the whole spill about communication and such until the vacation part. Yeah get out of there.

Make sure you: cancel all bills in you name, leave the keys behind (slid them under the door), and leave a note explaining why instead of a text. Honestly, he will probably try and contact and if he doesn’t then it definitely shows more was going on.

Good luck OP!"
859,"The important thing is when you told him how you felt he acknowledged right away that there was a problem, he didn’t get defensive or angry, he didn’t play the victim, he knew that he was hurting you. That’s major in any healthy relationship. Same for you too - if you do something that bothers him and you own up to it, the two of you will continue to have a good relationship. "
860,"Really weird that she's not accusing you more. Its an STI...she called you and asked if you cheated to throw you off because yeah, thats literally the exact course of thought when you contract an STI. But she didnt even press it? Ask to see your phone? Even grill you for lying? Thats what anyone who was in a monogamous relationship and didnt have sex with ANYONE ELSE would do.

She also seems...VERY sure that she's the one who contracted it. No blame on you. If she didnt cheat, why would she be so sure it was her that got it? She's trying to appease you. Even if there was a genuine belief that it could be contracted through something other than sex, she'd not be so sure it wasnt you.

I'm only giving you all this in case its not obvious that she cheated dude. Challenge her to get honest. You're letting her bullshit you."
861,"Make it a rule - If he's on the spectrum he'll probably react well to a clear set of rules.  And your new houserule is that he can't enter if he didn't take a recent shower. 

It detaches the action from the cause. He can still choose to believe he doesn't smell. It's sometime very hard for people on the spectrum to see ans understand someone elses position. 
"
862,"Absolutely. I had a violent ex as well. He started out okay, but was unable to control his shit behavior and started escalating. By the time he started embarrassing me in public (once because he accused me of smiling at another guy at the mall), he was very close to putting his hands on me. So OPs friend may be working through a similar cycle, as abusers tend to go in cycles and that guy is most definitely abusive. "
863,Sounds like she was cheating on you from my point of view but that's me dude. Good  for you for doing something for yourself. 
864,Uhh $35k while still carrying student loan debt isn't a lot when you're 37.  It doesn't indicate saving for retirement is a high priority.
865,"&gt; Your daughter sounds spoiled tbh.

The fact that OP's first response is to come here wringing her hands about how awful this is and ""how can I make my kids happy"" instead of putting her foot down and telling those two to grow up and show some goddamned respect to their uncle tells me that this didn't happen in a vacuum. I'd bet this isn't the first time the kids have pulled this shit."
866,"""And we’re too poor on both money and time to afford marital counseling."" 

Sounds like a perfect time for a baby! Babies are cheap and self sufficient, right?"
867,"Yeah, I understand why your feelings are hurt, but odds you're making it worse than it was or needs to be. I think, first and foremost, I should let you in on a little secret - despite what literally 100% of media would have you believe, men's sex drives are just as complex and delicate as women's. We aren't 2D, nonstop sex machines. Whether it's ED due to biology, performance anxiety, depression, eating too much too recently, being tired, having a bad day...we can have trouble getting it up even when we want it the most.

Maybe your husband was feeling a little drunker than you thought and was worried he couldn't perform that specific night, so he wanted to expedite getting in the right ""head space."" Maybe he's just gotten used to warming up with porn as a way to pass those 5 minutes you're getting ready, but then he developed a slight dependency on it (this can happen, and doesn't at all mean he's not into you...he's just conditioned himself to rely on visual stimulus, which can 100% be undone). Maybe he was just gassy and figured porn could help him power through the discomfort and get horny regardless.

You have NO idea. You need to sit down and - without judgement - actually talk to him. I think you should also consider the fact that your husband is getting older. I'm only nearing the end of my 20's and I can tell my sex drive is different now than it was 10 years ago. I imagine that'll be just as true 10 years from now. What if he's simply trying to deal with his changing body and now you've turned his crutch into something humiliating? You're seeing it as you aren't sexy enough, but he may be feeling like you're accusing him of not being man enough to get it up on demand. The only way to deal with all this and avoid this problem snowballing is to simply talk.

I have to say, though, it kind of sounds like you already know he didn't really mean it like that. You just still have your feelings hurt and your ego a little bruised. Odds are, you really don't need to feel that way. But the only way to deal with hurt feelings is to talk through them. Good luck!"
868,"Firstly, I wouldn’t trust that he has told you the whole truth, either about his separation or the current state of his marriage. It’s a well-worn cliche for cheaters to misrepresent their present relationship to make their affair partner feel less guilty: at least you’re not ruining a ‘happy’ relationship /s.

Secondly, the wife deserves to know. She has a right to know who her husband truly is, as well as the necessity of getting herself tested. It would not be you who broke up this marriage, but him. "
869,That's also my plan. 
870,"OP, I know that for you the resolution is finding an answer to a seemingly simple question, but I don't think you've realised the giant can of worms this has opened.

Her obsessive feeling of being unclean is to the point where it actively interferes with her life so that she cannot fight the compulsion and acts on it. These are some big red flags for unchecked OCD, and the showering sounds like a ritualistic behaviour. She shouldn't need to go home to shower, and shouldn't be to the point where she cancels other plans or conceals her behaviour. She may think that it's functional, but it isn't.

I am not an armchair psychologist by any means, but I am diagnosed with OCD and multiple showers was one of my compulsions and it got to the point where it was wreaking havoc on my skin and I had to see a dermatologist to break-through and undo the cyclic thinking with information (essentially that over-washing actually dries out and damages the skin making it more susceptible to infection, not less; and that balance, gentle cleansers and less frequent washing would benefit my skin's health more). I went from showering 2-3 times a day (minimum) to once every other day with gentler bath products that were suitable for sensitive skin, and I now have techniques to combat the need to over-wash.

872,"Consider this an expensive lesson about him and his priorities. He only cares about himself. He doesn’t care if he inconvenienced you or cost you extra money. It’s a hardship for you? Well it’s not a hardship for him and so it simply doesn’t count as a problem. 

If you pay the $500 now and keep him in your life, that 500 will balloon into thousands of dollars (and that’s just the monetary cost. What is your time worth? What about your self respect?) 

He made it very clear who he is. It’s up to you what you do with that knowledge. "
873,"thanks for the update, but just saying I don't think being a ""mean asocial troglodyte"" is something to just be ok with. Maybe you're just putting on a pretense in some kind of defensive way, but realize that you can be asocial without being mean. also, good for you for continued therapy. :)"
874,"oh my god NO, you are not an asshole or a monster. Not even close. Your GF broke up with you and then needed a favor. You warned your ex that you were dating, etc. Any bad feelings your ex had upon seeing your current GF are 100% on her."

877,"Do the Southern Belle thing: oh, auntie, let’s not talk about this and make my wedding day unpleasant” or “let’s not talk about unpleasantness. You sound polite but also know you managed to sneak in a little snark. 

Congratulations and enjoy your day!"
878,"Don't give in. First it's the wedding, then what ? They belittled you and they just want to use you. 
Use your money for YOUR wedding if you get married, or for anything that will make you really happy. But set boundaries with your family. Maybe say you can help with planning the event or something ?"
879,"Your MIL lives 14 hours away. I think you should greyrock her, tune her out and do whatever you think is best for your child. I also think your husband should trust you and himself as parents rather than listen to possibly outdated advice from a woman who doesn't seem to respect either of you."
880,"You are more than entitled to reject an open marriage.  You rejected it, and he asked for what is basically a break-up.  In both the post and in another comment, the way he's acting now is waaaaaay too light, especially with how badly he hurt you.  Is this worth saving?  Are there any other issues in the marriage? "
881,"&gt; Callie literally ruined this girl’s life. 

To be fair, she had help from a whole lot of people who had no reason to give a damn about their soap opera bullshit."
882,"I passed up going to *Oxford* for a boyfriend that I had when I was 18. 


There literally isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t regret it or think of it, and I’m almost 30 now. 


Never, ever, ever, give something like this up for a crush."
883,"&gt; fucked up really bad and I just don't know how I'm going to move without my parents showing up and making a big scene. 

Call the police. Explain the situation (that your parents are trying to physically prevent you from moving out) and ask them to send an officer at the start of your move to ensure that they don't block the proceedings. The officer can supervise and warn your parents and you can call them again if your parents throw a fit.

Have friends help you move if you can - they will offer additional protection from them.

You should absolutely move out. Continue with this plan. You can do it.

Inform your landlady that your parents are abusive and that you are moving to escape them. "
884,"It sounds like he just wants you and him to have a casual relationship. From what you've said, he doesn't seem to be interested in something potentially more serious.

Talk to the guy, though. Give him the ""what are we"" conversation before you potentially get hurt "
885,"If dad threw a dog against the wall so hard it didn't bark for a week, that to me is a serious, serious problem. Not only because it's straight up animal cruelty, but because he ""solves"" a ""problem"" with violence. I just hope those girls get good kindergarten teachers, who will be in a better position to know if there's anything they need to report. "
886,"I'm going to guess the person who keeps telling her all these things is her abusive husband. 

She doesn't need to tell him he hurt her. She needs to get away from this abuser.  "
887,"You are not at all crazy for thinking this is a deal breaker. If you move in with him, it will be entirely on you to clean up after him and you will resent him so much for it. "
888,"&gt;The rest of them sound miserable. 

One of the wisest things I ever heard in my life was ""happy people don't make others miserable."" I mean, why would they? It's people with a shitstorm going on in their lives that love to spread that shit around.

889,"If you marry her right now, it’s almost guaranteed you guys will get divorced. Are you really ok being the second choice? She’s basically saying she’s settling for you and will leave you if the ex or someone better comes along"
890,"I see that now, I needed reassuring.  My son and I will be just fine.  Being a doormat sort of runs in my family, I watched my mom be one for years.  I really need to break this cycle."
891,"What other option could there be? You can't make her have sex if she doesn't want to, and you don't want to have sex with other people. So, it sounds like you guys are incompatible and should break up."
892,OP is going to get fucked up when this girl moves on in college.
893,thanks for the advice. when you put it like that it makes me think about it very differently actually. it make it seem very obvious what the right thing to do for me is 
894,"The market is hot pretty much everywhere for real estate (in the US at least). It’s really tough for buyers to get what they want in their price range because of this... so many people want the same homes because there are so few available which is driving prices way way up. 

But, do not settle for something for the sake of buying. I would sit her down and ask her exactly what she wants in a home - then sit down with your realtor and let them know that too. Maybe, your realtor is confused about what the two of you are really looking for and that’s why you’ve been looking for so long (it shouldn’t take 5 months even in this type of market to find a home). 

Also, if you’ve signed a contract with that agent, you should find out when that expires... she may not be doing what she really needs to be doing for you two. Buying a home can be such a frustrating process and having someone who isn’t really helping you the way you need to be helped can turn the process into a nightmare. 

I’m sure you wife is just frustrated with how long it’s taking, but I’d also sit down with her and ask her to be honest with you about what’s going on in her head. Maybe it’s a combination of things. 

"
895,"So many ""I think, I like, I love, I, me"" statements. What about what your daughter wants? "
896,"Agreed. Learning how to deal with boredom is an essential life skill and the earlier we learn it the better. Personally, I don't think we do kids any favors by raising them to believe that life is all about them and fun-fun-fun all the time."
897,"Talk to the school when you get there. Talk to your sister. There is no 'should' on your part here. Your parents may be doing this out of misplaced love, but it was the wrong way to handle it, full stop. They 'should' have told you what's going on. Your sister won't find it as easy to block you in person. You don't need to be rude, it's not her fault presumably, but she's old enough to think for herself. And absolutely do let a counsellor know what is going on. "
898,"This is a clear case of ""she has more balls than you"".  Get comfortable setting boundaries.  You can be firm but kind.  Use phrases like ""Oh, there's really just enough for me for tonight and then my lunch tomorrow"" or ""Thanks, but I'd rather just eat alone"".  When she asks to join you tell her you'll happily eat with her and then ask what she's making for dinner.  She'll get the hint eventually."
899,This is exactly what’s happening.  He doesn’t want to be in the relationship anymore and so he is trying to push OP away while maintaining a “good image” because he doesn’t want to be the one to end it.
900,"To me, the real concern here is that her spreading these rumors could make someone wonder if there wasn't something to them, which would obviously be extremely illegal, immoral, etc., and nothing good could possibly come of people having those suspicions about your family. Even if you have never done anything inappropriate whatsoever wirh respect to Brandi, you really, really don't want to be put in the position of trying to convince her school/DHS/the cops of that fact after Brandi has been going around basically saying otherwise. That's the angle I would approach things from when talking to your boyfriend and Brandi. 

Edit to add: you need to take a delicate approach with Brandi because IMO she's not acting out of malice but rather teenage attention seeking and insecurity, but with your boyfriend, you need to make it absolutely crystal clear that him doing nothing is unacceptable. If he doesn't listen, then surprise, surprise, the guy who dates someone closer to his kid's age than his own has judgment problems and doesn't treat his partner with respect, maybe that's not the right person to be with. "
901,"Red flags everywhere!! Listen to your gut, you shouldn’t be feeling this after a month , he has a bit of a creepy side as well. "
902,"Have you ever held the word no.
No I don’t feel like going shopping.
No I don’t want to go to a party just now.
No I can’t do this task right now.
Just say no.
And mean it."

904,"&gt; Buuuuuut if we ignore the whole creep-who-takes-advantage-of-drunk-young-girls thing

WHY WOULD YOU IGNORE THIS?!?"
905,"Real talk:

Let's say your Mom decides to let you change your name. You go through with it and walk out of the court house with your new birth certificate or whatever. You go to bed and wake up and go to school the next day.

You go to the office and give them your new paperwork. They alert your teachers. You're sitting in class and the teacher does role call. She calls your new name and you say ""Here!""

Now what? Those bullies are suddenly gonna change? They are most likely to keep calling you Abigail and tease you **even harder** because they know it bothers you. Even worse, they may tease you for changing your name instead. 

I know you think changing your name will stop the bullying but honestly, things don't normally work out that way. 

Make your weakness your strength, OP. Look at them dead pan when they tease and say ""Yup, i'm white as snow Emily. I do white people things like buy mayonaisse with a credit card."" Then roll your eyes and just keep doing you. Just try to act like your name is old news. You got 3 more years, OP. You can do this! :)"
906,"I'll assume you don't have kids. If you think you're planning to, i would give this some serious consideration. Kids are WAY more work than dogs when it comes to this kind of stuff.

Personally, i couldn't handle this kind of situation. Locking the dogs in a room doesn't teach them anything beneficial and certainly doesn't address the issue. Instead of removing the dogs from the area, he SHOULD be removing the cause of the issue, which you have asked him to do.

Perhaps having a trainer in to work with you at your home would help him understand. Sometimes hearing it from someone else can help to reinforce what you're saying.

If he refuses and keeps up with the anger towards them, the decision is up to you whether to keep the dogs and tolerate it, rehome the dogs somewhere that works for them or potentially leave and take the dogs with you. 

"
907,Definitely take the job. 
908,And isn't it great that he showed you what a manipulative asshole he is so early on? You can break up now and walk away with a light heart. 
909,"Tactfully deal with your brother? How about dealing with your horrible daughter.  Who in the hell does she think she is to judge your brother for having a baby? That is none of her duck ng business. I know you love your daughter, but she is so out of line here that she would be the one I would ask to leave.  "
910,"This sounds really toxic imo. Marriage is a partnership and it’s true what you said about him treating it like a room mate situation. I’m worried that when you have children, he’ll expect you to do most (if not all) of the work because of his mentality. "
911,"Damn girl!  Grow some balls!  This guy is stomping all over you.  He has fucking **NO** respect for you.  You can love him all you want, that's fine, but what's the point when he doesn't love you back? 

While he's out with his ""friends"" tonight, get all your important papers together.  Get some of your essential things (change of clothes, medicine, whatever you need for a few days) and stash it somewhere with your papers.  Then go see a lawyer.  Don't continue to be a doormat by sitting back and letting him get the house and dog."
912,"A month and he's trying to get you to take your implant out?

You have to run. He's not safe."
913,Sleep with a body pillow between you. Then your gf will cuddle that and not you.
914,"Outside of the issue with your mom, just popping in to say that while you have your own baggage with your recovery, you still managed to get with a guy who has a LOT more baggage. If he was JUST a recovering alcoholic? ok. If he was JUST 10 years older? Ok. If he was JUST divorced? Ok. If he JUST had a kid? Ok. If he JUST had a record? Maybe ok. But ALL of those together? girl, them's a LOT of flags. "
915,yeah it is a really strange situation. I think you should just sit him down and tell him straight that you know what the tattoo is based on and ask why he chose to get it done. and tell him how you feel about it 
916,[deleted]
917,"It is completely okay for your daughter to be bored for a little while when her mom is socializing with friends. That's what an imagination is for. I say this as an only child whose parents did not subscribe to the ""it's my responsibility to keep my kid entertained 24/7"" ethos so popular today."

919,"&gt;  My boyfriend has a tendency to fight unfairly by being condescending and calling me hurtful names 

&gt; he's lost faith in my ability to be healthy 

&gt; doesn't know what he's still with me or why he loves me 

&gt; He also told me that he's not sexually attracted to me anymore 

&gt; He said that there's many women that have commented that I am lucky to be with him 

&gt; he just kept telling me to stop playing the victim 

To put it simple, you are better off without him."
920,"It's not just the cheating- it's that he's threatening to cheat as a way of trying to *force you to do sexual things you don't want to*. That's completely, 100% reddit-verified scummy and a low, bullshit way of handling it. It's one thing to say something that stupid but to get to the point where he'd LITERALLY drive to Vegas? Really?!??

Like, look, I'm not a huge fan of giving BJs. Not for the reasons you mentioned, just some associations that make it hard. My partner loves them. Does it bum him out that I really rarely give them? Sure. Does he have a fucking temper tantrum or ask me to do them when I'm *sick??* No! Because he's not an asshole and it's not the most important thing in our relationship. I do plenty to make sure his needs are met in other ways. It sounds like you're doing that in your relationship. 

Honestly this is one of those things I'd take a real, sincere step back from the relationship over and start counselling. Because if he thinks this is acceptable behavior, I guarantee you can expect many more years of it during your marriage."
921,"Basically he wants you to be with him when he's out (good), except he doesn't care how that affects your life (really bad). Pressuring someone to stay out longer than they reasonably should is very much a young 20's thing to do. It's not the most terrible thing to do as we want others to have the same fun as us, but staying upset about it is really the big line draw. At that point he only cares about himself and not you."
922,"Yes. If he is this unhinged at 6 weeks, I’d actually see that as a red flag for future abuse. To be honest, I would consider it an extremely emotionally abusive incident as is. Even his apology was manipulative. u/brandyviper look up the cycle of abuse. Look up lovebombing so you’re prepared for what is likely coming.

People are on their best behaviour at 6 weeks. Either he cares about sex more than you, or this is his best behaviour.

At 20 I would have put up with this because I learned from my parents that my own needs weren’t to be respected and valued. At 37, after years of therapy, this would be an immediate, on-the-spot dealbreaker."
923,"This is my waking nightmare. My fiance's kids are living with us currently and I've been in their life for years and watched them grow up. It'd be right hellish to get caught up in any type of accusations because I love these kids and our family. The world isn't a kind place for homosexual relationships, much less ones between different ages and ethnic groups.

I just want to get everything cleared up before it gets to that level where the rumor she's spreading to sound cool or to keep from being embarrassed in from of her friends ruins our lives."

925,"What kind of chit chat with a waitress brings up ""I'm done having kids""?

Also, **how have you been with this guy for 14 years and never talked about things like ""should we have more children?""**

But hey, at least you have an easy entry: ""Hey babe, when we were at the restaurant the other night and you said you didn't want more kids, what was that about"". Then go from there.

After **14 years** (and a kid), you're not boyfriend/girlfriend. You don't need to dance around this shit. "
926,Women are so trained to give in to this shit. Don't. His feelings are actually not more important than yours.
927,"If I were me I would tell James. If this is a pattern for your friend it means her moral compass is not straight and a marriage certificate will not change that, she will end up cheating on him."
928,"And if he continues to be dismissive then what? 

At some point you need to look out for yourself. My fear is that since you’re so hard on yourself and your looks, you’re putting up with bad behavior and huge lack of respect from your partner. Which is basically to say...watch out. Being labeled a pedophile will haunt you for life so make this serious, and if your partner doesn’t take it seriously, he doesn’t respect you as a person, flat out. Reading your story made me hard cringe at how things could go quickly wrong in this day and age - I have no idea how he found it funny or cute. "
929,"&gt; No offense meant to your two guy friends, but they're young and they're looking at that through male eyes.

Yea, these guys' reactions are pure naive machismo. Not only have they never been in this type of situation, they've also never been *a woman* in this type of situation. Their shaming of OP's date is disrespectful, ignorant, and a bit gross."
