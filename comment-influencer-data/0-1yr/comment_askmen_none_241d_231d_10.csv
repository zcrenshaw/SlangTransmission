"I just asked my husband this and he said:

“You used to make a layer cake most weeks and put it right on the counter in a glass display case. I don’t know when that stopped but I miss it from the deepest parts of me.”

I told him he should try for something more broadly relatable and he said:

“Back the car into the driveway for once so I don’t have to reverse into traffic first thing in the morning.”

Thanks r/askmen, this initiated a good talk. "
"Just because I have a day off, doesn’t mean i am free that day. Do not make plans for me."
"More random physical contact. A quick brush on the arm, a hug from behind while I'm cooking, etc. "
"Don’t be offended if I want some time to myself. It doesn’t mean I don’t want to be with you, it means I don’t want to be with anyone. It’s nice to have that once in a while no matter who you are."
She is 1.5 hours late and you're worried about a polite way to talk to her? Bruh....
Give me “me” time and not take it personally 
"Say “Oh yeah sorry about that, you were right. You’re fine carry on!”

"My first serious girlfriend was black, we were together for a couple years. 

One thing I never was made aware of before was how black women style or make their hair look the way it does. She went through so much trouble and paid so much money at the salon to get those all those many long braids tied into her hair, and before I realized they weren't actually hers, I could have swore they were real. When she had them taken out, all she had left was just a little poof. She wore a rag on her head for a while, wouldn't even take it off, just wore it like a hat, day in and day out. I convinced her to let me see underneath it at least once, and she was embarrassed by it, but I thought it was adorable."
"Admittedly at first was going to say sexual acts and overall being engaging, but I'm going to take it a smidge further. Return affection. I loved giving oral and she likes getting it but I know she doesn't like to give, cool. Her sex drive isn't anywhere near where we used to be, also fine. I'm the only one that reaches out for affection. 

kisses? Gotta ask for them. 

back/foot/leg/booty rubs that I happen to give on a near daily basis? Gotta ask real nice for those and I get 5 minutes of it IF at all.

 I kissed her neck, embraced her and gave her scalp rubbies every chance I got... I have to ask or lead her for that too.

 One day I stopped asking for those things. one day I stopped initiating everything. Everything died when I stopped. We had so many problems in our marriage... I won't go into details, but I dealt with all of her flaws and I love every last hair on that woman to this day, but I swear if she would've just returned a little affection it would have saved our marriage. 
I take care of my house/kids/finances/dogs and I don't need anyone for shit, but I can't kiss my own forehead. Men need love too. We feel insecure sometimes too. We might have more experience with rejection but you turn a man away too many times and it hurts us like it would hurt you to be turned down. 

TLDR:

If there are ladies reading this, appreciate your man every now and then. Kiss his forehead unexpectedly. Tell him He looks handsome, tell him you love him sometimes, not in passing but REALLY look at him with some love in your eyes so he knows. Grab his butt. Touch him in passing even just a little. Remind him that he's loved too."
Love herself more. She's such a bundle of anxiety and self doubt. I love her and wish she could see herself as I see her.
Stop crashing the car into other parked cars or other stationary objects 
She could surprise me with a divorce.
"This post has started a good convo between my wife and I. 

One thing my wife does that is really good is she asks me often “anything you want to talk about?”.

I’m not a big talker and this makes me share and open up more than I would. "
When their thighs widen out when they sit. 
"Racism. I learned racism. In order of how common:  
  
Racist looks or comments from: black dudes ""You KNOW he aint' hittin' that right"" or just blatantly hitting on her in front of me, following us to my car, etc. Had to shut that shit down real quick.  
  
Snide looks and muttered comments to me or about her from white girls. Couldn't hear them often but when we went out drinking together sometimes it felt like she was in mean girls. And white girls would try to hit on me in front of her like she was invisible. Had to shut that shit down real quick too.  
  
Occasional snide looks and muttered comments to her or about me from black girls. Though this was about 50:50, some were mad she was dating out of her race (""can't find you a good black man honey?), some were were like ""You go girl, get that white boy paycheck"" (I was pretty fucking broke at the time).  
  
Mean looks from old people, directed mostly at me since I dressed pretty preppy at the time.  
  
Racist comments from trashy redneck white guys: happened only once but was pretty jarring because they were blatant as hell about it and we were in farm country.  
  
Also I learned that white people are ashy too you just can't see it because we're white."
Found the wife
" Drives me batshit, my wife volunteered me to go pitch hay for a friend of hers. My wife who knows absolutely nothing about farming or the work involved of getting 2 trailers of hay into the barn, volunteered me, the boy who joined the Army to get away from farming to go pitch hay... she was rather shocked when I laughed in her face. Another time she volunteered me to go serve drinks at the Ky derby so her school could earn extra money.....again that was a HARD no."
30 minutes with communication. Probably 20 with no communication. 
"Can you at least, ask me how I am?

It hurts when you don't."
"My wife, after 12 freakin’ years of marriage, admitted yesterday she was wrong about something. Said she was wrong to have married me."

"I find it incredibly attractive when they let themselves nerd out. Like, the minute the polite facade drops as they really get into something they're passionate about, that's the most beautiful thing. Yes, spend an hour telling me every obscure sea turtle fact (or avatar, or Sanderson, or whatever) you can remember and let me bask in the glow of your joy about it. 

Basically when the pretense of manners drops and they are really their genuine, dorky self, that makes me fall in love, so to speak. Dare to be a hopeless nerd about *something*, doesn't matter what. It shows your humannness and makes me feel less alone. "

"Lots of things can be attractive if they feel natural and not forced.

My first girlfriend hated her voice and look after waking up for example but I loved it because it felt so 'real' if that makes sense.

I like seeing a girl smile when she is excited, I like hearing a girl laugh or speak in general. I like it when they find me trustworthy and share stories with me. Being comfortable in her own skin and with physical contact is attractive too, like a touch on my arm when she laughs at I joke I made for example."
"As a black girl dating a white guy, it is so incredibly comforting to see a thread like this around. Even when it comes to things like hair maintenance and silk pillowcases, to bigger issues like racism it makes me feel so much less alone to read about other people’s experiences...even though I wouldn’t trade our relationship for the world, it can definitely be a stressful dynamic at times"
"Quit drinking 
:("
"Not married, but 5 years deep with my partner.

I just wish she'd drive more carefully."
"Yeah...women are sensitive about their hair.  Multiply that by 10 with black women.  As a black man, I'm actually glad that I can cut my own hair without the need for a barber.  My only problem now is the same as men everywhere...having hair to cut."
Awww i hope you do him that cake.  
"I'm not dating her anymore but I was amazed at how differently I was treated when I was with her. Service people tended to be more snippy with us as a couple then they ever would be with me as an individual. We would get followed in stores. People looked at us a lot. 

It kind of clued me in to how common that stuff was for her as a black person because she didn't even really pay attention to it anymore. It was just a part of her life. It made me very uncomfortable. It put a lot of my opinions into perspective."
"I’ve found that living with someone really cranks it up.

Like.. even if you see your SO 7 days a week,  you still have time to yourself if you aren’t living together... but somehow after you move in, heaven forbid you want an hour or two to just chill. "
"I plan to. Things got busy and for a while I was baking semi-professionally so didn’t often feel like baking recreationally for the house. But I’m flattered to know he misses it and I’m going to make him his favorite lemon cake with chocolate butter cream tomorrow.  

I really should back in I just never think about it because reversing out doesn’t bother me. It’s safer to back out though, and besides, if something that simple would make him so much happier, it’s a no brainer. I’m glad I asked him the question. "
"you should really sit down with your wife and tell her to stop doing that shit.

maybe say it nicer than that though"
i'm 5 years deep in your mom hahaha
"Not rag me about not getting stuff done around the house because I don't have any free time. 


When she was the stay at home parent and I worked, I came home to a messy house and nothing done. I never complained. The kids required her full attention. I understood that. I saw it as my duty to do whatever I could after work (clean house, give the kids their baths, play with kids while she relaxed, etc.).


Now that the roles are reversed and I'm home with the kids all week, she expects me to remodel our house everyday because I have a little bit of handyman experience. I couldn't even install outlets without taking several breaks to do stuff for the kids. It's not even worth it to try and do home projects unless the kids aren't around. "
"When a girl takes her hair out of an up-do after a long day and shakes her head around to loosen it up. Bonus points if it’s super curly. 

Also when they act all lovey with their dog. "

"When my wife is “on” around our friends. She thinks she’s awkward and she has some social anxiety, but I don’t see it. She is so charming and funny, it’s a treat for me to sit back and watch. "

"grabbing your arm when she's scared, trusting you through a stressful situation, looking out for your well being when your too focused on work (bringing you food, reminding you to go to bed), etc."
"Curly hair snags and frizzes against a cotton pillow case, whereas it glides on a silk one. Black women have super curly hair and so are more likely to sleep on a silk pillow case to prevent hair breakage/frizzing"

I swear I'll never stop touching the butt 
Recently went out with a black woman.  She tried to explain her hair/weave.  I still don’t quite understand it. 
Just occasionally show interest in something I'm interested in.
"Sorry, can you elaborate?"
"Give her three choices. Tell her to either pick one or veto one. If she vetos, you make the final call."
"Our relationship didn’t work well and we were at the point of divorcing until I started to take more time for myself. 

I started telling my wife sometimes: “I want to be alone.” In the beginning I included that it’s not because of her but that I just need this. Now it’s a natural part of our relationship, I don’t need to tell her anymore. 

This has saved our marriage, together with us trying to change ourselves selves instead trying to change the other. 

We have a happy marriage now. "
"Her parent's were more racist that she was with a white man than my parent, who was raised by racists. I learned to accept that I am not accepted, had a great relationship. Her mother never once talked to me.

Some people are so set in their ways, I'm glad it didn't persuade my GF to leave me. 

The hair thing is so true tho, don't touch it, don't comment, don't do anything but pay for it."
Don't ask her out again.
"Stop spending money. 

She’s not materialistic...it’s all stuff we need....it’s just everything all at once instead of spread out over time. "

"I learned about how some (maybe even the majority) of them find forearms and hands to be attractive, and even more specifically when they can see the veins in them. 

I also learned that (almost) every time a girl does the “wow your hands are so big” thing and then you both put your hands up to compare size, theyre lowkey into you and it was just an excuse to make some physical contact with you.

Definitely wish she had told me that one earlier because I definitely missed a few hints with that one."
"Assuming there was a very good reason, I'd wait 30mins max. "

"Cornrows look better if the braids are long, but many women don’t have hair long enough to pull it off. So you add what we call ‘extensions’ to make the braids as long and as thick as the style requires. 

There’s many types of extensions. For braids, cornrows and the like, the best type of extensions looks like loose, long hair. It comes in a two-foot plastic package, commonly referred to as a “pack of hair”, lol. Because it’s loose, it’s easy to pinch off 20-30 strand clumps and braid it into your hair. If you want thicker or longer braids, you use more strands.

However, it’s not impossible that she’s wearing a wig that *looks* like cornrows. If it’s a wig, she probably avoids activities that endanger the wig, like I do! I use hair gel to secure the wig to my hairline, but if I want extra security I use wig glue. I still am very unlikely to go swimming though.

Let me step in here to point out that your perception of what a wig looks like is likely very limited. You likely only notice the bad ones, and can’t fathom being unable to tell if someone was wearing one. But done well, wigs can be imperceptible. That white-haired chick on Game of Thrones is wearing a wig. [This is a wig.](https://youtu.be/wNt_H9dYemM) Homegirl looks fierce.

Underneath the wig (if she is indeed wearing a wig), she’s doing whatever it takes to make the wig lie as flat as possible. Personally, I shave my head because fuck it— I’m never gonna wear my real hair. Other women flat-iron their hair and sculpt it around their head as flat as possible, securing it with a wig cap. Still others braid their natural hair in tight cornrows followed by a wig cap. Whatever is necessary to make sure the wig doesn’t look/feel like it’s sitting on top of a bush.

If you want a little more info, I suggest following [Dem and Ika](https://youtu.be/thQAfBvGLzw) on YouTube! They are a totes adorable couple and even have a video called “3 Rules to Dating a Girl Who Wears Wigs/Weaves/Clip Ins”, lol

Hope that helps!"
"I like you. I think we would get along, hanging out at the edge of parties, but never actually talking.  "
"This is why I feel like I’ll never meet a guy organically. Unfortunately, it seems like approaching someone in public is now viewed as weird or creepy, which I’m sure it could be in some instances, but I honestly wouldn’t mind if a guy struck up a conversation with me. I don’t go out much to bars or clubs, and I’m a med student, so I spend a lot of time at the hospital or in clinics. I always secretly hope I’ll meet someone while grocery shopping or while out &amp; about in some way. Pretty much leaves me with online dating, which has its own issues."
"This is a chance to tell my fucked up story! 

I was spending time with this girl (lets just call her Pam). She was just a friend to me but she wanted more. I was not interested. On my birthday my friends bailed on me. I was alone and down. Pam offered to take me out. We went to have drinks and dinner. I had one drink and thats about all I remember. 

I woke up the next morning naked in bed with her in a hotel room. I flipped out and ran out of there. I was barely 21 and had no idea what to do. I am pretty sure I was ruffied and taken advantage of. We talked and I told her I never wanted to see her again.

Fast forward to a few months later. I am walking into a restaurant with my new girlfriend and inside is Pam and a bunch of her friends. A mini panic attack swept over me. I had get the fuck out of there. As I was walking away one of Pams friends runs out and says ""Pam is pregnant and it's yours from your bday"". 

I freak out, run over to talk to Pam and she yells at me says how terrible I am, how she is going to keep it and she never wants to see me again. This was before social media and it was way hard to track people down. All I had was Pams cell phone number and she disconnected it. 

This is about the time my life fell apart. This caused me so much anxiety I lost my gf, job, dropped out of school and became ill from all the stress.  I had no way to contact Pam and I desperately wanted to be there for my child. Fast forward to about six months later I am at a party chatting with some people. I introduce myself and this girl says ""oh! are you THAT gochaca? The one that knows Pam?"" even just thinking of how I felt right at that moment is making my chest hurt. The girl says ""I can not believe Pam did that to you"". I ask what and she replies ""you know, made up a pregnancy to get back at you"". 

I had no idea. It was all a lie. She was never pregnant. She just wanted to hurt me for telling her I didn't want to talk to her anymore.  I immediately left the party and went home to cry and feel relief. I think I slept for 18 hours the next day because it was the first time I was able to get a decent nights sleep in more than half a year. "
"I dated a black girl for a few years. Don't say shit about her hair, they work hard on it and pay a lot of money. That's why she was so excited whenever she was going to get her hair done.

The racism is there and it's not just from white people. Lots of dirty looks all around, but I didn't give a fuck. The older white people were too big of pussies to follow up on their shitty comment. It's easy to just tell all the haters to fuck off.

It was an interesting experience. We ended up breaking up because we just weren't compatible enough as a couple, though we're still great friends. "

"19M dating 19F. She is half-black, half-Mexican.

One thing I learned was that as a kid, her father (black), taught her, and her siblings, that racism is almost a thing to be expected, and that she would have to work hard and be a good student, because nothing would be handed to her. Having never experienced this in my own childhood, when she told me this during a debate/discussion about race issues, it really changed my perspective.

Another thing I learned when having Thanksgiving with her father’s side of the family; their cooking has Cajun roots and everything is, in my opinion, overly spicy. Apparently salt and pepper is a white people thing.

Also, in public we seem to get a lot of attention, which I doubt we would get if we weren’t different races. I don’t know whether it’s positive or negative, I’d imagine it’s a mixture of both, but people sometimes double take or nod their head in our direction when talking to their friends (this happened today in a mall).

Finally, I learned who the racist people are in my family, not a good feeling when some of your family doesn’t like the one person you love being with."

She has put up with 13 relocations and decorating our 9 houses. She is the handyman in the house, not me. She is my best friend and we take care of each other when sick.

She has been at my side for 46 years and cannot imagine life without her. I have tried to provide her with a lifestyle she never dreamed she could have. She asks for nothing, so I give her everything.

She still loves me fiercely after I stopped being the hot guy she fell in love with.  She has always been free to date others and yet never wanted to. She is the proverbial one who I let free and showed she loved me by coming back to me. I cannot imagine her doing anything more to make my happier. "

"My partner has extreme anxiety and lots of other problems going on. I remember when we first decided to move in together he said 'i'm going to need to be alone a lot and that's not your fault'. Sometimes he will come home from work and spend all day in bed, or just physically won't be able to talk to me for a few days. I've not done anything wrong, he just can't cope with any more people. That's cool. It's super tough but it has slowly become easier over the years. 

A lot of my friends tell me I need to force him to talk to me or make him come downstairs or go out on dates or ask him to make it up to me etc, they would 'never let their man get away with that'. But as you say, regardless of whether you have anxiety or not, being alone is or allowing another person to be alone without being offended, is such an important part of a relationship. 

I do wonder sometimes wherher we live in a world nowadays where people just expect others to be around them for their own benefit. Like, you should be making me happy. Make me happy. I dunno. This is just such a small but incredibly important point. "
"Start making decisions like you did before you met me.  I am all for discussing important matters but ever since we got married it is as if she lost all confidence in her own abilities.

"It doesn't matter what the other person's gender is... ±15 mins is acceptable, but then *I* will attempt contact, and communicate that I expect to be informed as a matter of courtesy about lateness, and if no response for 15 more minutes, I'm outta there... If I can reach them, I'm likely to suggest another time if they're not going to make it within the next 30 minutes; but, if they break their ETA again, without initiating a call to me, I'm ghosting that fucker! Simple courtesy dictates that you inform anyone that's waiting to meet you, as soon as you realize your going to be late, even if it's 1 minute beforehand."

"Right? I hate being volun-told I'm gonna do something. It's bad enough that, being a jack-of-all-trades, everyone asks me (or through the wife) to help out with shit, but then to be volunteered for things? If I'm home and didn't have anything planned, maybe I didn't WANT to have anything planned. As I've said in the past, sometimes it's nice to be able to enjoy what I've worked my ass off to get, to enjoy what I pay for. "
Had to break up with my GF of 4 years several times after her therapist's recommendation. This was because she damaged her brain to the point where she no longer retained long term memories after her final binge. Trying to explain to someone that I loved very deeply that we are no longer together and haven't been together for months (multiple times) when the last thing she remembers is leaving our apartment for work is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Please seek help for your wife before it becomes too late.

Doesn't sound like much, but I hate people taking photos of me. I'm very unphotogenic, mainly because of my (in my opinion) ugly ass smile. That comment cut through everything. It was the nicest thing he ever could've said. 10/10 compliment. I'm still self conscious about my smile, but never around him. "

"Mine never goes as far as to say I sit on my ass or call me lazy but she makes passive aggressive remarks about all the stuff that needs done around the house and I have to remind her that I had literally zero minutes to myself. And when I do occasionally get the house to myself for a few hours, I feel so guilty about the stuff that needs done that I pack the entire few hours as full of doing projects as I can. On the few occasions that she's taken the kids away for multiple days on vacation, she comes home to a completely remodeled room every time. "

I'd actually love to go out the occasional evening and make grown-up friends and play with other adults too, not just the kids.

"What stands out most to me from the two longest relationships I had with black women (no more than a couple months, but still), was that neither of them wanted me to meet their parents. 

One just didn’t want to deal with the drama it would cause (which I was fine with) and our relationship just kind of petered out soon after that. 

The other flat-out told me that if her parents found out she was dating a white guy, she’d be kicked out of the house. Since she couldn’t afford for that to happen, it was a no-go. I was more saddened by that than angry.

And I expected it from black dudes and old and/or racist white guys. But the white girls really pissed me off the most because it’s not like she “acted black” or anything.

Men need that sappy couple-y appreciation too. I would have killed for a surprise hug from behind while cooking. And yes I did eventually ask for this kind of thing. Did not get. 

I’m sorry to hear about your experience with this. I dealt with it for a long time bc her son had grown attached to me. For clarity there were many far worse things going on, but this kind of thing almost hurts the most bc they are tiny and easy. "

Wig incident stories... you mean like having it blow off in the wind, lol? No, nothing like that has ever happened. There are too many tutorials on YouTube these days to allow for accidents.

It’s a lot worse than most people think. My former girlfriend took me out for some pizza and immediately when we sat down to wait a few guys started to catcall her and try to demean me. Constant “Why are you with him and not us?” Or “you’re betraying your own kind light skin” or “fucking (racial slur) tryna take our women”. By the time we got our food and walked back to her car they were feet away and following us and ganged up around her side of the car trying to get her to go back to their “party” and trying to sweeten the pot with weed and 40’s. It ended with her flashing her gun and they scattered like roaches. 
"So like, you don't want to be happier in your marriage?"
"As a Black man, it's nice to see White men and Black women dating. Maybe it's because I'm in France, but I don't get to see many Black women being with White men, or simply non-Black men. Even if I don't care about the race and stuff, it can't be ignored at the end of the day by some people. Some women I know say it would be ""betraying our blackness"". I don't see it that way. Falling in love isn't about race. But dating, then marrying someone, is about a lot of parameters, including race sometimes. 

I won't publicly congratulate a mixed relationship more than another couple but just know that I'm proud of all of you. It's the XXIst century, it's time for race not being a problem anymore. We all have our types (for me, it's Blacks and Arabs born in the 90's since I was born in this decade) but it doesn't mean we must be racist. Unfortunately, I can hear people saying bad things when they see an interracial couple and it's useless to name them since you more or less know them. "

First I just want to say that a lot of girls (not just black) wear weave/extensions/wigs/etc. 

It’s def what the other poster said, it’s mainly personal preference. I know girls with long hair who rather just tuck their hair up, throw on a wig and go about their day. Girls like to wear extensions for that extra oomph. It’s all about feeling beautiful and there are certain hair types that are not considered “desirable” which is why women wear weaves. "

I think a conversation needs to be had here.
I once dated an Italian lady who asked me if I would have a problem walking with her through the mall.  I thought it was a weird question because I don't get why that would even be a problem.  Turns out this was due to her insecurities she developed with her baby daddy who himself was insecure.
"Not even married yet, but this sort of thing I've realized is a huge deal. My last relationship fell apart for many reasons, but one was that I placed too much stock in the other person telling me when things were wrong. In my current relationship (going on 3 years), I've always tried my best to be perceptive of when they're feeling down and ask them what's up, and it's helped a lot. Even if the person doesn't want to talk about it, they'll still appreciate the gesture of reaching out."
"How my very liberal father, even after watching Get Out, still couldn't help but act like the antagonists of that film.

To be clear, he never tried to hypnotize my girl or give her non-consensual surgery, but I swear it's embarassing how often he asks her questions as if she's supposed to represent her race, and sees her less as a person and more as ""a black"".

A few examples:

""I hear black people don't like the TV show Black-ish, what do you think,(girlfriend)?"" (This not in a discussion about TV, or black entertainment, or anything relevant).

""I saw an article about Black Panther in the Entertainment Weekly and thought you might like it, so I saved it for you, (girlfriend)"" (the first and last time he did something like this)

I mean, sometimes if I want a different perspective, I might ask her something, but holy shit, it's like my girl is the be-all, end-all of being black to my dad. It's fucking weird. "
"Additionally, standing up straight and holding her head high! "
"Six years of Thursday night date nights. We set boundaries early in our relationship that we wanted alone time, alone time spent near each other, and time together. It really helps, especially after new game releases and other hobbies. He doesn’t feel guilty if he wants to “ignore me” for three days in a row for a video game. We live together and have this entire time. I recommend it."
"Perhaps it's silly, but just knowing this is the case makes me feel a bit less alone in this."
This is a mature and reasonable answer. Follow through and lead a happy life.
"My wife gets easily stressed about little things. She's very intelligent and capable, but little things get to her sometimes. I wish she could be more relaxed."
"I don't know how old you are but I'll give some perspective. My parents have only grudgingly accepted the white men I date and it's more of a ""I trust your judgement"" than anything else since they've been stand up guys. But from my the POV of my parents they don't particularly like white people because white people have treated them like shit for all or most of their lives. You just wouldn't celebrate your daughter dating your abuser's son. That's about how they see it and... given the stories of their life and hell my own experiences, I don't blame them. There were a shitton more racist white people around when they were younger and even I have to inquire about a guy's parents before date them. And even then you'd be amazed at how many guys don't know their parents are racist as fuck."
"When she is super attracted to you and is trying not to show her cards, but her body language is betraying her - her eyes widen when you make eye contact, her mouth is slightly open and her tongue traces the roof of her mouth, you touch her ever so slightly and her breath catches, her shoulders do that back and forth sway as she talks to you.

It's different from conscious flirting."

"Did it twice.  The interaction with the girls wasn't too different than with white girls.  If there is one difference, I would say it is black girls are more direct in their communication and about telling you what they want, while white girls tend to be coy and will make you guess.  Another aspect is that black people really seem to stand up and take notice when they see an inter-racial couple and are perfectly willing to acknowledge it.  I was a lifeguard at the time and when another (black) lifeguard found out, he started laughing and singing ""TearsofLyys got Jungle Fever!""  When we were driving down the road in a black neighborhood, we got a lot more looks than when going through a white neighborhood.  Not a single white person I came across would even acknowledge the fact we were of different races.

"To me this is the right way to go about it. If you see genuine interest and are enjoying the conversation ask for a number to continue said conversation. The thing is you have to be honest about it.

However, if you chat her up because you genuinely think she seems interesting than those feelings will be reciprocated. "

"all 3 individually said their ideal penis length is just under 7"" and massive ones scare them and think they're a waste cause they can't fit them in anyway. made me feel slightly better"

I would love to see a poll of some sort with how women feel about being cold approached in like a grocery store.

"Stay at home dads are very under appreciated. The incredible value that you are adding to your children's lives by having dad stay at home is immeasurable. 

If more men and women reversed roles every few years throughout raising children I think we would all better off. 

I used to be the stay at home mom. Now I work and their dad is at home. I understand the struggle of making three meals and several snacks during the day and cleaning up after them and you all while trying to make sure they are getting what they need from you emotionally and developmentally. Keeping them alive and thriving and healthy is constant, and then you have to try to take care of you. 

When I get home, if my kitchen is dirty and my husband has had a hard day with a screaming 1.5 year old and a cranky 4 year old, then he can go chill for a bit while I set the kids up with an activity and clean up. It's difficult to be both the at home parent and the working parent. Both offer different struggles. If the house is clean when I get home and I am exhausted, I am beyond happy. "
"I started losing my hair pretty early (like 13 or 14), so finally choosing to regularly shave my head was quite the emotional ordeal. Took a while to get used to seeing myself in a mirror."
That women’s public restroos  are as disgusting or maybe even more disgusting than male public restrooms
"YES. My partner always manages to come in for the sneaky hug from behind when I’m pulling a hot tray out of the oven or tossing something in a pan. I worked in a commercial kitchen most of my life so burns don’t bother me much but he hates them... yet every time, I tell him “not while I’m at the stove” and he doesn’t listen. So I get the choice of hurting his feelings or him getting hurt physically 😑 "
30 minutes. No show then I’m on the go 
Okay so give my husband even more alone time haha 
"Sounds like you married an asshole. I’m sorry. If you want to understand why a husband treats you the way he does. Ask about his parents and how he saw his mom treated. Most men reflect how their parents acted in front of them. 
I personally do what I can to help, but it’s also a two way street. My wife tells me about problems, but she refuses to work on her own issues I have with her. 
"
i thought she was fucking the dog for a minute 
"I get it! My idea of a vacation is to set at home and enjoy the home we pay on every single month, but only ever really sleep in."
"My wife is gorgeous, is an awesome cook, and keeps us active/healthy through diet and encouraging exercise. But she's a distant mother, in that she makes little effort to know our child, his friends, or interests beyond the basics.

She doesn't know their favorite color. She doesn't make their school lunch, or know much about their day at school. She never reads to them at bedtime. She doesn't tuck them in. She never takes them to after-school activities. She rarely drops them off at school in the morning, and rarely picks them up in the afternoon. She rarely makes plans for us as a family. She never reaches out to other moms for play dates, sleepovers and social nights. She struggles to hide her disinterest in kid-friendly activities that bore her. She rarely attends social gatherings of other parents, meaning I go solo (raising eyebrows) or not at all. When she and the kid are home together (random days off or I'm working on the weekend) the kid's entire day is spent on YouTube or video games.

And so all of this becomes my responsibility despite the fact I have longer hours (she works less than 30 hours a week, I work 40+). Being the caretaker, aside from her meals 2-3x/week, from sunup to sunrise burns me out. I love our child and enjoy being their hero, but I don't want her to miss out on the kid's affection now and in the future; as it is, I've had to explain too many times why mom couldn't attend &lt;fill in event here&gt; when the truth was she was probably at home browsing Facebook. Our child is an awesome, smart, witty, athletic, amazing person who deserves her time and attention. Sometimes I feel like she sees the kid more as an opportunity to earn Likes because they made Principal's List again rather than flesh and blood worth knowing.

And yeah, I have selfish reasons too: it'd be nice to have a little more free time myself. To enjoy my own hobbies, get some shit done around the house, or catch up with the few friends who are local. To not get weird side eye glances from other parents when I'm contacting the female half to coordinate kid activities. And holy hell I'd love to be able to hang out with other parents without them asking if they'd done something to upset my wife (on account of her repeated absence) or going as a single dad yet again."
"Your friend is a cunt. A cunt with an extra $300, but still a cunt."
You cannot.
My Girlfriend is black and one thing I learned from her is how important lotions and moisturizers are. The first thing I noticed is how soft and radiant her skin was and she said it takes a lot of work to be that way.

"Chokers, nice fingernails but not overdone just nice painted nails and short shorts"
"As a bigger, ugly looking dude myself, I typically try not to follow women on the street if we’re walking in the same direction, especially if it’s dark out, etc. I’ve crossed the street before to avoid potentially freaking her out. Other than that I just totally ignore women (politely) unless they directly talk to me or I need something of them. 
I’ve also, on a number of times, told off hobos/panhandlers trying to sweet talk/cat call girls, clearly making them uncomfortable. I live in a rough area with college students, so stuff like this is common.
For Tinder dates, I have insisted we meet in a public space and facetime first to make her feel safe (and I guess for my own safety).
In certain situations that would merit a compliment or some sort of courtesy such as complimenting a dress or etc, I usually just say nothing as to not creep anyone out. I don’t comment on insta/facebook posts. If I make smalltalk in the elevator, it’s never a compliment, just something kind.

Wow, I never realized how much I take this into consideration."

"So... at least in  my friend group (we're all 22Fs) we aren't talking about how big you are, or if you were really bad... we're more talking about things that confused us. Like my friend would message me to ask if anyone had ever had someone go soft on them, and if that means he's not into her anymore etc. Or why he didn't kiss me after our date, or something like that. It's more about counseling than anything. We don't have group chats ripping apart the guys we're sleeping with. "

Absolutely savage
"My boyfriend does this for me. He gives me several choices, and I choose one. It's been pretty effective so far. "
My first serious girlfriend was black and had straight hair.  It wasn't until two years into our relationship that I found out it was naturally super curly. It was after we came out of a pool together and it got wet and dried that I saw it for the first time. She explained that she went to the salon a lot and always got it permed. Kind of sad because I actually love curly hair so would have been happy to find out earlier.  She let it stay curly from time to time after that.
This. It kills me that she doesn’t have any interest in even trying to learn about my book.
I'm five inches deep in her mom.
Now I wanna learn how to stitch shit on to cushions just so I can stitch one with that
Black women are extremely sensitive about hair. Shit is no joke. I'm a black man and I see and hear this a lot.
...Oddly specific 
"1. She was a doctoral student at UPenn
2. She owned a business across the bridge in Cherry Hill, NJ
3. She was the director of a childcare center
4. Her dad was dying of cancer

I operated under the impression that all these things were true for awhile. I was desperate to get out of a really bad situation, and she was desperate to have me move in with her. 

The day we were slated to move into a beautiful apartment in one of the hippest neighborhoods in Philly, her dad “died”, and we couldn’t move in.
Feeling like something was up, I called the business she “owned” and asked for the owner. It wasn’t her. I then looked up the child care center she was “the director of”. That was a lie too. She was listed as a teachers aide.

I had packed my stuff and everything. Looking back now I dodged a .50 caliber bullet. There was clear signs of serious mental illness and I was using her as an escape out of a bad situation. It was no good.  

But the lies blew me away."
My SO wore a bow/headband thing on Saturday and I don't think she knows how cute/sexy I found it. 
"""Ooh yeah eat that PB&amp;J motherfucker"""
I think a lot of men are like this. Every single time I get mad at my SO he tries to get me in bed! I thought at first he was just trying to distract me and get me to shut up but he gets legit turned on! And that usually just makes me even more mad haha
"Sex. 

I would overlook the stupidest shit if only I were able to get laid 3 times per week.

"This one for sure.  I've had more than a few conversations on dating sites where she told me she 100% was not into hooking up,  and I told her that that's all I was really interested in,  so good day and good luck ma'am and then lo and behold since I was so ""special"" she could bend the rules ""just this time""

Yes, sure 🙄"

"this is so alien to me, I live in a country with a big black population but wigs and weaves are not common at all.
there is still (although getting waaaay better) the discrimination against curly hair, but the usual alternative is chemical straightening. 

can I ask more questions? 

- why do you say you'd never use your natural hair? how long ago have you used it last? 

-do you have any wig incident stories? 

"
I was gonna say the same thing about being a guy dating a black girl!
"I’m not married but was with a girl for an extended period of time. 

I would have loved it if she just STOPPED reading into what I was saying. I told her repeatedly “I am blunt. What I say is exactly what I mean.” 

After I said that I’m sure her thought was “oh my gosh what does that mean???? Are we breaking up???”

(Im exaggerating and being harsh on her. She was a great friend and we had a healthy break up)"

"I am guilty of this. I have a terrible time making decisions and my partner gets so annoyed at me. 

However when I do finally make a decision, he always has a problem with it so I feel like I can’t win.  He’ll say “Next time pick somewhere cheaper/classier/closer to home etc”. Or “well I would have chosen ***** if it were me”. At times he can be rather self important. 

So maybe that’s why your wife is scared of making the decision? "

"Profile said single, she was married, they did not have an open marriage and the poor bastard didn't know a thing. I only found out because the husband saw the dirty texts and nudes she sent me. We were discussing meeting up in person (she lived in a neighboring city). Dodged a nuke, I think.

Other than that, I haven't really caught *that* many lies from women on online dating. Like u/LEIFey and other guys have commented, the big one is misleading pictures - that's fairly common.

Also, I've met a lot of slim girls who considered themselves fat and fat girls who considered themselves ""fit"". So, really, when it comes to weight, the only thing I trust is my own eyes  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "

Aye. Love the oversized t-shirt messy bun look
My relationship with my wife is great. Very little to complain about. But I would say that she could have more drive or ambition. She doesn't have any serious passions other than me. 
My boyfriend and I are both at home for the most part. He hangs out in the bed to watch TV and be on the internet. I made me a woman cave downstairs where I can do my arts and crafts and watch my shows. We come together throughout the day to eat or just check in and around 8:00pm I go upstairs to bed and we hang out together. It works for us as we both agree we do not need to be on top of each other all the time. Eve discussed it and neither of us feels the other is just trying to get away from the other. We are both very happy this way.

"I blew up at my 6 year old daughter for eating her cheerios too loud, mid screaming rant I saw her eyes, her facial features and body language. In an instant I was transported to my own child hood with me staring at my mom while she screamed at me how I didnt appreciate anything and I was worthless. Turns out I have clinical anxiety, PTSD and depression that have all been feeding off each other in a cycle of shit."
"Oh, no prob.

I have a dozen wigs. Maybe more. But I’m eccentric, so I wear every color that compliments my skin tone.

I will switch to a different wig every month, but I do take it off every night, wash it every two or three days. When I’m feeling a new color, I put the old one in a plastic bag and save it for when I need it next time.

Keep in mind I could totally switch it up daily! But If I’m feeling a particular color, it will take me about a month before I want to change it up. What I’m saying is that there is no rhyme or reason to the month limit. Some women have exactly one wig and wear it daily for years, and if it’s a human hair wig it can last like 5-10 years if taken care of."

"Stop explaining things in arguments, I’m not an idiot.  

Stop retelling me everything from the beginning to the current state of affairs with your friends.  

Stop picking fights with me and the kids.  You’re a bully.

Stop waiting for me to shower before coming to pick arguments, I have no way of getting away from it.  Same goes for car rides.  Road trips are the worst.

Raising your voice doesn’t make you right.

Comparing yourself to shittier women doesn’t excuse your actions or methodology.

False promises to the kids are more damaging than doing, and saying, nothing.  

Actions speak louder than words.

Stop using the expression “that’s what I’m saying” we know through and through that that’s NOT what you were saying.

"When her eyes lift up after she finds out I’m REALLY ticklish around my midriff and she starts to chase me around the room to tickle me even more.

When she puts on my glasses while we’re hanging out.

Basically whatever she does as long as it’s clear that she’s legitimately enjoying herself."
"Probably not. Neither of us are there to meet people, if I was in her shoes I'd just be annoyed that someone was bothering me while I'm trying to get shit done.

Funnily enough I remember saying it and I think I actually believed it... I have since got some self awareness, thanks to my boyfriend lol  "
A woman who is just naturally determined and you can see it in their face. The power of their will is a physical force and carries others with them like an ocean tide. It's incredibly hot and intimidating.
This is also done by black women who get relaxers (a chemical to straighten curly hair) because if they scratch (create an open wound in the scalp) they will burn their scalp there when the chemical is applied. It causes burning and scabs in the scalp later. 
My girlfriend taught me that. She uses lotion like every 5 minutes and tells me I need to because my hands are ashy I just can't tell because I'm white.

Like- it's not so bad when it's just like touching my arms or something, but randomly touching the face/beard without warning is just awful, and I feel like an absolute dick telling them to not, so I just sort of have to let it go"

"White guy married to a half black(her dad) half white(her mom) woman. I learned that her only being half black makes a huge difference for her. She doesn’t really fit any black stereotypes. She has, as she puts it, white hair. She doesn’t listen to “black” music. She doesn’t have what you would call a booty, or boo-tah as some put it. Most importantly she hasn’t faced any backlash for her race. She’s never been called any names or had to say “it’s because I’m black” in a negative way. 

I’ve been treated more poorly than she has for us being in a interracial couple. I had a dispatcher back in my EMT days that admitted to singling me out for unwanted over time and shittier calls because he, as a black man, didn’t like the white guy who was engaged to black chick. I recall times where he tried goating me into saying I called my wife the N-word and shit like that. This was 2010 or so and I never thought I would actually run into someone like that. "

So he could drive 30 minutes to take me home. Just because I was sleepy. The entire time I was thanking him he thanked me because he would otherwise worry about me, and then I fell asleep on the car ride home.

"I've told this story before but here we go again

I come from a white family but when I meet people for the first time they always assume what kind of Asian I am. So much so that they think i'm lying when I tell them that I was born from white parents. So anyway, my first serious relationship comes around and of course the first thing she ever asked me was if I was Chinese/Japanese. 

So a few months into our relationship I decided to play a little prank on her and I started to build this whole narrative of how I took a 23AndMe test and found out that I was adopted. I told her that my biological mother took the test as well and that I was going to fly to LA to meet her since she lives in China Town. She ate that shit right up, started going on and on about how she knew I wasn't white and all that. A few weeks later I start talking about how my mom, LuLu, was brought to the US as a child and was knocked up by her childhood sweetheart but they couldn't afford me so they put me up for adoption. 

I started telling her fake stories about my Chinese family that my biological mother told me. Then over spring break I went with a close friend to California so that we could visit China Town. While there we found a middle aged woman and explained the situation to her. She thought the whole thing was hilarious and decided to help out on our dubious task and she pretended to be my mom for a few hours as we took photos/videos. Her last name was Zhèng and thus I Americanized it to Cheng to make it easier to type. So we completely convinced her that I was adopted and had another family in LA. 

Eventually I spilled the beans and she was pissed but after that I started going by my fake mothers name, LuLu Cheng. "
"To add to this, ghosting is just shitty. Just say what you mean - tell the person that you no longer wish to date them since they couldn't be on time. How hard is that?"

"Yeah hi. I’ve been with my partner (now fiancé) 12 years and must suck on that D 2-4 times a week. Often because I want to, and often because I think “I know he would love this”.

I imagine all caring partners, male or female, think this about their partners and oral. Go down on your man, go down on your woman. Just do it! For you, for then, for the relationship."
I was so shocked the first time i went to a blow dry bar. Clientele was predominantly white girls with blonde-ish hair and i want to say like 90% of them all brought their extensions to be styled in. Piles of extensions sitting in front of each girl. It was like i was suddenly in on their secret! Lol

"I once waited 2h for a date to show up. She didn’t show up.  Right when I was about to leave, I saw a girl sitting at the corner who looked like she needed a person to talk to .  I approached her,

"A girl I'm seeing was telling me about a conversation she had with a friend recently about the new guy her friend had been dating/sleeping with. 

In this short conversation she had with her friend she already knew how big dudes dick was, whether he was good in bed, whether he went down on her and whatever else. 

I made a comment like ""damn y'all share a lot of personal info"" and she immediately responded saying guys must do it to. Surely we talk at length about the size of their tits or what their vagina is like and I said no not at all.  We might mention who we are sleeping with and whether she's good in bed or not, but thats it.

"Unfortunately it's incredibly expensive to maintain and very bad for the hair. 

You have to bleach your hair all the way, which is super damaging, then stain it the exact right blue/purple that cancels out the hairs natural yellowiness. And that only lasts about 5 washes before the stain washes out and it's yellow (""brassy"") again."

"Nothing. That's the honest truth. The two of us are so symbiotic. We have a great relationship. If I had to knit pick, it would be, when I cook for dinner, usually she would clean and vice a versa. But if I cook and offer to clean. Please let me. Because I know her, and know when she's had a rough day, or just wants a lazy day. I will gladly clean up. To be honest I like cleaning.
She's great though, she'll always insist. But I'll find a way to do the cleaning just so she can relax.

"In these modern times, dating can be quite difficult. I’m in my early 30’s, and it’s hard to meet someone organically (not a dating app). With the ever growing mentality of “what is around the corner could be better” type vibe, it’s quite challenging. 

I’m still single, in my 30’s and have had very few serious relationships. 

I’m trying to learn that everyone has a different time line. And to not try and follow others. People have (I did too) an expectation in life when you hit a certain age. Like a career, house and kids by 30-35. I don’t have a career, or a SO for that matter. 

Yes, it gets me down sometimes. And yes, I miss companionship. But I learned the hard way, to not get into a relationship because a time line said so. I ruined a year of my life, if not more, dating the wrong person. Essentially forcing myself to love her more than I really did. "

"I recently watched a movie about this successful black woman who never let her cute n also black fiance see her without straight hair, but it's difficult to do her hair herself so her mom would come over at dawn to do her hair before the guy wakes up. She never went swimming because it would ruin her hair etc. In the end, she finds her true love and jumps into a pool at a party overthrowing the shackles of societal blah blah. I enjoyed the movie!! 

I really want to see that Chris Rock docu movie too, heard he did one about hair, a very sensitive topic.

I also like watching YouTube videos about how black women do their hair, esp with wigs, n how they iron straighten it (it's like magic!! Fascinating) and I also like that series Insecure... It's strange, I'm Chinese."

We both work and do our own separate me-time activities and it's great. We hang around on the couch and watch Netflix, or sit around quietly in the office reading and that's also great. Wouldn't trade any of those things for the world.

But I'm a cuddly motherfucker at heart, when we're laying in bed first thing in the morning or when we go to bed at night I want to cuddle with you and I want you to put your phone down and cuddle me back. Maybe we can initiate some sexy time, but that's optional, just acknowledge that I'm cuddling you and reciprocate a little. Twitter and whatever news alerts you've gotten on your phone aren't going anywhere, but we only have a narrow window of time before we have to start our separate days and I want to make the most of it.

But when I'm standing at the stove stirring something or chopping veggies, that's exactly when I don't want to cuddle. If I take my attention off of what I'm doing, shit is going to burn, or I'm going to cut my finger off. Save it until after I'm done cooking. Our tiny apartment kitchen is not big enough for 2 people, get out of there when I'm cooking."

"My last college relationship and then my first serious relationship, which started about 4 months later, were both with black women. 

First thing to note: People are people no matter what they look like or where they're from. Second thing, their skin texture is different. 

90% of the time I didn't notice the color of their skin at all. The second girl occasionally made me aware of some things either by pointing them out or explaining them to me. Like the culture around black women dating white men being viewed negatively as an example. 

But really the very most important thing that was reinforced, though I knew it before, was that people are people. There is very little difference between us that we don't ourselves project and create. Right now I'm dating an asian immigrant so even an entirely different culture. There are a lot of cultural things I learn about her and why she comes to the decisions she comes to. But at the end of the day she's still just a person and no different at a fundamental emotional and interpersonal level than me. Race is nothing. People pretend race is something other because they can't deal with it. It's the same reason we have this stupid notion that men and women are so vastly different that we need to bridge some illusionary gap to understand each other. We're not. And we don't."

I got it sorted. Not as in the depression was totally sorted out, but I called it what it was and took steps to fight it. Now I feel like my heart is on fire. I do so much and feel so much, on all ends of the spectrum. It's miles better. Sometimes worse, but even that is something that I appreciate after so many years flat. "

It does kind of suck that while it is getting more ""trendy"", it's still very much a love it or hate it kind of thing (in my experience).

"My current girlfriend of two years is black (I’m a white dude) and one of the biggest things I learned is a difference of culture.

Often it’s easy to assume that all households operate on a similar level to your own, but at least at her house things were generally different. Her family has different sayings they use to describe a certain situations/ things. Also cooking style is completely different, like growing up in my household our standard was chicken breast, mashed potatoes, and peas for dinner. On the other hand my girlfriends family had a whole slew of recipes ranging from “sweet buns” to “Dorito taco salad” to “spam fried rice”, and I’ll tell u personally it was all really good.

On the other side I saw her family places emphasis on different things than I did. I’m not entirely sure if this is a racial thing, but her family doesn’t place importance on education nearly as much as my family did. Like when my girlfriend would tell her parents she had to do homework, they would call her a nerd and want her to watch a movie instead.

Finally I would say that my girlfriends family is generally a lot closer knit than mine. Once again not entirely sure if this is a racial thing, but her family put a lot more emphasis on family gatherings and going to events all together not splitting up. I grew up on the opposite end of the spectrum where I was on my own for most stuff and given a lot more freedom.

"What'll probably shock her even more would be to find out that not only do a lot of guys not talk in detail about the sexual details of their relationships, but that it's actually so frowned upon (in most cases) that the guy would be actively shunned for being such an oversharing weirdo.

A girl I went out with for a bit was not only surprised by this fact, but she said that she also felt a little sad that guys and their friends don't have that kind of trust in each other to talk about that stuff. I told her that it isn't so much an issue of trust as it is just seen as sharing too much unnecessary info...and I still don't really get how girls blabbing about their man's dick is a bonding experience for them. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

"As a brit and an alcoholic I found this both confusing and funny.

After 30 minutes at a bar/restaurant waiting for someone, I would've started drinking probably too because why not; not like I've got someone to impress anymore (pissed = drunk).

On the other hand being stood up really wouldn't make me angry; very rarely do people show you who they are *super early* into a relationship. It takes lots of time to find out a person is terrible usually- OP dodged a bullet. Anyone that'll let you sit around for 30 minutes doesn't care about your time and thus isn't worth your time.

"My dad has made the comment that he got married and started raising us kids when he was 27 years old. I'm 33 now and I don't have any kids nor any prospects.

It does fuck with my head a little bit but I remember that my dad grew up in a time where having just an AA degree at a community college was all you needed to become an electrical engineer and homes were so cheap that you didn't necessarily need a home loan. He paid only $30,000 for a house that 30 years later is now worth $1.2 million.

Our parents/grandparents talk shit about how lazy millennial are but lived on the easiest difficulty. Right now you need a bachelor's degree to work at an entry level job and homes right now are so expensive that you will be paying $4000 a month over 30 years if you want to buy a house."
"Well put me down in the positive column. I mean, I wouldn’t want a guy to blatantly ask me out first thing without me knowing anything about him, but striking up a conversation, and then respectfully asking me out for a cup of coffee? Absolutely. It sucks that men feel like they can’t even approach a woman in public anymore without it being viewed as creepy. I enjoy being asked out. It makes me feel desired. But in the age of online dating, it’s almost nonexistent anymore."

Serious relationships are a million times more complicated now. The current culture has really skewed the dating world to the point that most ""serious"" relationships don't last more than a year.

"I'm a stereotypical guy in the sense that I love to smell my own farts, joke about farts, fart around my guy friends, etc.  So eventually, when my first serious relationship happened and we got into the ""we're comfortable farting around each other"" phase, I thought I'd have the upper hand on smelly farts.  I could drive her to the other side of the room if I was eating the right stuff.  I took pride in it.  That pride was shattered one day when I wsa sitting on the bed with her, helping her with some spreadsheets for work, and I smelled something that would be illegal in warfare, something that smelled like it'd call for a gas mask if I were in the trenches of WWII, something that you'd get called a terrorist for releasing over a city, something so foul that satan himself would need noseplugs.  I abruptly launched off the bed and asked ""what's that smell"" and that's the day I learned about the existence of period farts.  In the following 5 minutes, the smell became so horrid that I not only had to go to the other side of the room, no, I exited the room into the hallway.  And it followed me there, so I had to go downstairs.  It was that bad.  After that, I never terrorized her with my farts again.  No farting in the car and locking the windows, no farting directly on her when play-wrestling, none of it.  We had an unofficial truce from that point on; she'd won the fart wars."

I have very long hair, I do not wear wigs or weave. A lot of people assume my hair is fake, and I have friends who have told me I should cut and sell my hair to make wigs (not for cancer kids, but for profit for myself).

Once I went on vacation and was in the pool talking with some white folks I'd met. As I went to climb out the pool,  I felt someone pull my hair hard enough that it jerked me back into the pool. WHAT THE FUCK. I turn around to see the friendly little white girl I'd just been chatting with, standing in the pool with a shocked look on her face. She goes, ""I just wanted to see if it was real.""

If it hadn't been real, she would have literally snatched the wig off my head or ruined any extensions I had in. "
"Skwat chicks. Women look fucking awesome when they pick up heavy shit and put it down again. They don't get bulky, they get curvy and tight - I'm so happy this is breaking into the mainstream."
"I went through almost the same thing recently. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years now with 2 kids, but we’d been dating almost 6 years  before that. She was always affectionate every chance I got to see her, up to the 3rd year we were married. After that, it sort of slowly went away until I noticed that 99% of the time I was the only one that would usually, as you put it, reach out for affection, with the hugs/kisses/random grabass. Up until recently, I just chalked it up to me thinking I was just being really needy. As a guy, I was really unsure how to really even put it to words how I felt about it. I’ll be upfront to say that I’m a slight bit insecure about stuff like this, so my first thought was me wondering if she was starting to feel a bit disinterested with me after all this time. As time went on, I pretty much just bottled that up, until one day it she asked me if everything was ok. At that, I fell apart. I told her that I missed how affectionate she was when we first got married, that she was always excited to see me and was practically attached to me with attention that we’d give each other. That she was and is the love of my life and I was afraid something was wrong. We were both pretty upset at that point, but after calming down a bit, she let me know that she had no idea it had meant that much to me. According to her it sort of slowed because we were always with each other now, not the shorter bursts of time together that we had because of school and dating. We talked for a little while after that, but came to conclusion that I was her “lovable doofus” and I had nothing to worry about. Things are way better around the house now, and I feel great not having to carry all that worry around anymore. Now, I’m not the only grab-ass in the house. I know it’s been said a thousand times and more on this site but here it is again: talk with them, no matter how painful/worried you are. Don’t bottle it up. It sucks, but get it over with. Try to put it to words the best you can."

"I like that. It’s like being a fly on the wall, they might forget you’re there and the true colours come out. 

That’s how I realised girls aren’t so different from guys. It seems like both sides put a mask on when the opposite sex is around. "
You can do better than someone like that.
See a sex therapist with your wife. Worked wonders for us. 
I disregarded females and acquired currency.
"Yeah, I do that so I don't get a false accusation regardless of gender. Did it as a grad student too. When I need to have a very serious conversation with a student I ask a colleague to either be present or walk by once or twice. "
That’s because they know about lotion.
"Typically only men wear durags. They're extremely thin and really only work for very low-cut styles. Black women wear either head-scarfs (a giant silk square that can be wrapped around their hair) or a bonnet (shaped like a shower cap, but cloth or silk instead of plastic). I have some head scarfs that have the ties like a durag, but it's really the difference in size and material to keep all my hair tucked in.

Tbh I'd be really weirded out if my dude referred to my scarf as a rag 🤦‍♀️ I paid like $30-50 a piece for the silk ones I sleep in, and I'm thinking of bleach-stained rags you clean your toilet with when I hear 'rag'."
That sounds like a delicious cake
"My wife and I have been together for 8 years. In all that time she has come to me for sex maybe 3 times. At first she said it was because she was uncomfortable living at home, with the threat of being caught. I believed that for years. Now we are pretty sure she is asexual. No desire for it. Never thinks about it. Has no interest in it.

I could not feel any more unwanted. Any less sexually satisfied. I am 27 years old and have the miserable sex life of a 20 year marriage with no spark. I lay in bed, awake at night, hating her for it.

I just want her to develop some desire for sex. I won't lie, It is the single most important thing in a relationship for me. I have a very high sex drive. She has literally none. I just want a normal sex life with my wife. "
And now you know ;) 
"My girlfriend is a not black but she is a woman of color.  It had never occurred to me until she mentioned it after telling her parents about me, that she didn't know if they would be okay with her dating a white person."
"Now it's your biggest assest, unless thats your ass."
"Lifts up her shirt, exposing her almost six pack when it gets hot at work.  Makes me lightheaded."
"Basically, anytime you have ever gotten lucky and end up congratulating yourself for doing everything  right, just realize that SHE made up her mind about hooking up with you within the first 30 seconds.  You didn't do ""everything right"" , you just managed not to screw up and cause  her to change her mind in the meantime.  "
"I went to a fancy smancy highschool.  One of my English courses was Utopias/dystopias where we read things like Brave New World and Handmaids Tale ect.

One project was to design a Utopia (later on in the course, after discussing what an impossible feat it would be) but we got to cheat and just magic our utopia into being.  No revolution or setup just one day society is however you design it.

Everyone else in class created a super highly segregated (like straight out of dystopian YA novels) society.  One girl I remember the most had everyone broken up by area into upper middle and lower class.  Lower class had people like housekeepers who could only travel to the other areas to clean.  The upper class was made up of doctors ect.  She even made sure (by design) that the upperclass people had nicer homes than middle class who had nicer homes than lower class.

These people were so entrenched in the class system that even when they could design a perfect society dictated by their will they still made sure people were born into classes and their living conditions decided by it.

I thought I was going to be revered as fucking brilliant when I presented my Utopia (which looking back would appear like some insane Libertarion-communist hybrid brainwashed hippy-fest) and everyone gave me these weird disgusted looks and asked why everyone had access to everything.

I think we all failed pretty hard when you look at it but it was eye opening to me at age 16 or 17 or whatever."
"I've had several over the years who I would respect when they didn't want to talk about something going on in their lives, but would expect me to be an open book about every aspect of my life.

Twice I've had female friends screw up my attempts to date someone, because they didn't approve of my choice/wanted me to date someone else. It maks me very uncomfortable neither of them saw anything wrong with this behavior."
Yes. Yes we do.
I think people look so attractive like this too! They’ll be like “oh sorry I look gross rn.” But I’m thinking they look their best. Guys as well! It’s my favorite style 
"Yeah, you should still be careful about that one.

"I’m so guilty of this as a wife. We have shared interests that we can connect on, and when I do something on my own he at least fakes interest. But I have so much trouble when he’s telling me about his stuff, I don’t know if it’s his delivery or my selfishness but I tend to forget what he says as he’s saying it. "
Idk I never looked. Flaccid my Weiner is super duper tiny though so it kinda just sticks to my body at all time anyway 
"I don’t know but my wife was in the habit of telling everyone about my expertise in certain areas of our sex life. Some of our friends would get uncomfortable and shed usually share stuff when I wasn’t around. I told her off one day and said that what happens in our bedroom is between us. 

She stopped giving out information, but I honestly would like to try some things in bed, but won’t even bring them up for fear of her running her mouth."
This feels like a dad joke. 
Aaaand we’re back
I was pretty strict with alone time when I first got with my wife almost 10 years ago.  We still have our own time and our own time.  Surprisingly one of our favorite things to do is run errands together.

Damn dude. You got one really shitty deal. At least in the domestic aspect. 
I'm creepy af for this but I love when women look innocent in public when I know they're a freak in the bedroom. Not being sexy is sexy when I've seen the other side of them. 
"I like buns and braids but yes, absolutely. Hair that is up and out of her face. It lets me see her."
"That sounds like a red flag to me. Even hobbies I don't care about that my SO is interested in, I still at least try to listen and look half interested because if they like it so much, and I love them, then there must be something redeeming about it. Or even just because my SOs face lights up talking about cool old cars or sports helps me deal with listening to stuff I find completely boring. He does the same for me as well when I go off about a book I'm reading or something I'm coding. "
"She still is!

I dunno, we'd known each other for a while and she was always quite a reserved individual.  There's something awesome about seeing someone come out of their shell and talk passionately about something they're interested in that feels a bit special, whether they needed chemical help to do so or not.  You get to see a whole new side of someone that you didn't really know was there.

I also seem to get affected a bit differently to most when it comes to cocaine.  It actually makes me more relaxed (but also alert asf) and interested in those around me.  Almost a bit like MDMA in some ways, come to think about it.

To her credit, she kept asking if I was actually interested or getting annoyed by the ranting.  I was most definitely interested :)"
"Yes,they dressed like that on purpose. They know what they're doing."

"I don't know bro. I was at Costco a few months back and there was this dude who was washing his hands beside me. He then proceeds to do a farmers blow into his hands repeatedly while continuing to wash. I'm mortified and need to leave. As I'm drying my hands, another dude comes up to the same sink, makes a hand bowl and starts drinking the water. It was so gross that I  broke out in laughter and let the room immediately. "

I don’t understand this at all! There is nothing worse than showing up to a date and seeing someone deflate the first time they look at you. I only have face pics on my tinder (I hate taking any sort of picture) but through Snapchat or just verbally I make very clear that I’m heavy. Why would people set themselves up to disappoint their date? How on earth do they expect that to lead to any kind of meaningful interaction?

So I work at a law firm and one thing we work on is transvaginal mesh after a hysterectomy. These poor women are constantly saying how their husbands left them because they couldn't have sex and it was too painful. It's really sad but intimacy is part of a relationship. It's hard to deal with that if it's gone.
"Had that a couple weeks ago. Sat on the train, girl sat down in the seat to the opposite of mine.

Seemed relaxed, took her jacket off, didn't let me catch her look at me once for the entire 15 minute ride, but in the reflection of the door window I saw her twisting her neck to stare at me when I got up to get off the train. I liked that. "
"I dated a lot of white/non black guys and they complained to me about the stares. Now some guys loved it, a lot of them couldn’t handle it. I mean, I get it...but I just reassured them that we make a cute couple and people just wanna look. 

Second biggest complaint was the flack they’d get from black guys- which is hilarious because black guys rarely hit on me/talk to me/etc but the second I’m dating a nonblack guy they wanna say some shit. If any dude is dealing with this, don’t feed into it. They want a reaction don’t give them the satisfaction of giving them one"
"Had a very serious girlfriend tell me she was totally okay with me never wanting to have kids. Turned out she wasn't okay with it at all, she just said so because she thought I would change my mind eventually.

I was bitter about that for a long time afterward. Maybe it didn't ""sting"" as much as getting cheated on would have, but it still felt like a monumental betrayal. It was definitely the single most important conversation we ever had -- with far-reaching implications on our long-term compatibility -- and she told me the exact opposite of the truth.

I mean, if she would have been honest at that moment -- acknowledged that she *did* want kids someday -- we would have broken up on the spot. But it would have been an amicable breakup. We would have parted ways realizing neither of us were what the other was looking for, and that's okay. We would have wished each other the best and remembered each other fondly.

Instead, I referred to her as ""The Lying Harpy"" for months after our considerably less pleasant breakup.

Now I get the ""I never want kids"" thing out of the way within the first three dates, every time, no exceptions. I figure it's either a selling point or a dealbreaker, and either way, I win."

No it’s actually both. Curly hair snags and is robbed of oil on cotton pillowcases. Can confirm
I can't even imagine a scenario like that; I hope you're doing okay.
"I'll be honest--I don't know why but this seems to be a reoccurring problem with women I've dated.     
The assumption is that I will and should take interest in all of her hobbies and come along for them but that assumption isn't the other way around.      
Which is fine--I choose my hobbies because I like them so I don't care if my SOs join in or not but it'd be nice if they'd give some stuff a shot.     
I dated one girl who was always planning for me to go with her to this or that, which was fine, but I gave her my favorite book to read and she never even tried to read.  I'd ask every now and then if she had started it--nope.      
Just a tiny bit of interest goes a long way.  Most of my hobbies are exciting to me and I have almost no one who cares about them.  When I meet someone who does like the stuff I do it's a huge thrill to be able to talk to them about it.      
So, you don't have to get terribly interested in everything but just deciding to really focus and try to listen and maybe even get into just one of his hobbies would probably be huge to him.      
Even if you don't end up loving it--it'll mean a lot to him, I'm sure.  "

Honestly, I've got things to do, so I just don't have the time for that. Sometimes on top of that, he'll have a nap in the afternoon. Like, okay, I got to sleep 6-7 hours, and have been working(have 2 work from home jobs)/taking care of the child/doing housework since 8 this morning, and you got to sleep, and now you get a nap, too? And if I say anything about it, I get the old ""But it's my weekend and I work all week, this isn't fair to me,"" speech. 

Sometimes it's about unfair distribution of work in the home. If you want that nap, earn it and I won't say a damn thing. I'd sure like a nap sometimes, or to sleep in. "

Kids are taught manners, and our attitudes and expectations for each sex’s behavior is becoming more egalitarian; but many women were subconsciously “programmed“ to defer to others. I see it in myself all the time when I bump into a corner and still say, “excuse me.” Women have long felt stigmatized for being assertive and I’d bet your SO knows how you feel but still falls back on these habits unconsciously.

You need to get to couples therapy asap.
