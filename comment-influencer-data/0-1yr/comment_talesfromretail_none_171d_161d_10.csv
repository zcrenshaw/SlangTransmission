"I've seen some bad attempts to apply for a job, but generally swearing and berating at ANY member of staff repeatedly might not be a good first impression"
She's 90. She already won. 
"This isn't as funny as your story but my wife and I both learned American Sign Language in college.  Sometimes we would use ASL when our mouths were full, etc.   One time we were at a restaurant in the mall, and we were speaking in ASL, but not verbally at all.  Both of us could hear perfectly well.  

A family two tables down started talking really loudly about us.  ""LOOK AT THOSE DEAF PEOPLE!"" And generally saying mean things.  We started talking about them in sign language.  I wanted to go up to them when we finished and say, ""You know, not everybody who speaks sign language is deaf.""  but they left before we did. "
"I worked at a bar and we always had to open bottles of beer to serve them to customers (for legal reasons). A lady came in and ordered 4 bottles. I opened them, gave them to her, and she went to sit down at a table with some other people. I went over to the table to see if they wanted anything to eat or just the beer. The lady had her back towards me and said “no, just the beer, but that c*nt at the bar opened all of the f*cking beer bottles and I only wanted one open!” She then turned around and her demeanour changed when she saw who she was bitching to lol "
"OK,  trying to figure out who had it the worst: Karen for having to be in the police car with the Pap, Pap for having to be in the police car with Karen, or the poor officer who had to deal with both of them. I think I'll go with........the poor officer. "
"Love when some think changing language can easily let them get away with things, especially when the one they're stealing from undertands FLUENTLY"
"Hmm.  I have a feeling that she's very bad at parking and keeps running into curbs hard.  Would explain the reaction when she's ""called out"" on it."
There's one major sign that you could have used to tell them how you felt.
Plot twist: shes actually 47
"I had a customer like this too! Our plumbing backed up and the pipe burst causing feces and water to be all over the floor. We blocked it, put ton of signs up saying ""out of order."" Then a lady comes in asking to use the restroom, and we tell her ""you can't due to plumbing issues."" Oh boy she didn't like that... ""EXCUSE ME?! I HAVE A RIGHT TO USE IT WHEN I WANT TO AND I WILL BE CALLING YOUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND TELLING THEM ABOUT THIS!"" She tried to go to the back and use it anyway but the doors leading to the bathroom were locked. The manager told that she needed to leave, she did after yelling at us more about her ""bathroom rights."" Oh that day was just...yikes"
"I had a super sketchy guy in last night, when his girlfriend asked about our ‘Now hiring’ sign and hour much it paid I told her the hourly rate and sketchy dude asked if that was under the table. 

I laughed.

He was serious."
"If I hadn't worked retail, I wouldn't believe someone could be so stupid.... But yeah, some people are that stupid. "
"This sounds like someone who doesn't want a job, but wants a copy of an application so he can prove he was looking for a job.  Either that, or he's just really dumb..."
"Have to admire her lack of giving a fuck though, she got caught by the balls and still told you to go fuck yourself haha "
Talked with the person who ended up talking to her last and we both came to the conclusion that she was trying to get with the mailman as she kept mentioning him every time she called. After her account title was fixed she cried down the phone to my co-worker. That was her 2 day working here.
If she didn't buy anything... did she leave without a shirt on? Or did she have a spare with her?
"My favorite was when I worked fast food. One guy wanted to apply while I was working register. Not only did he tell my boss that he knew me (never saw this dude in my life), but said that he wanted DOUBLE the hourly rate ($8.50 at the time, so he wanted $17/hr) with zero work experience or recommendations

Surprise surprise, he said we were losing an amazing employee and left when my boss said no to the absurd rate"
"There were two officers, so at least they had each other. "
"I had one get pissed that we had set the pump for (iirc) something like $3.05 worth of gas. My coworker and I were confused as hell because it was set for the $20 he had given us and he hadn't started pumping yet. It took a moment for us to snap to it, but he was looking at the price display thinking it was what we had put as the prepay amount. He said we should make the pumps less confusing as though we have the ability/need to do so.

People are fucking weird."
I have never opened my own beer at a bar
She wore out the shirt that she had just bought at Madewell haha.
"This reminds me of that story from a couple of years back where some guy who was on the faculty sued a college claiming discrimination because he was handicapped, so the college agreed to settle out of court for $80k on the agreement that the case would not go public and remain just between them. Right after that, the guy's daughter started bragging all over social media about how her dad just won $80k from that ""stupid college"", how she was going to spend the summer in Europe, and how that college (that she specifically named) can ""suck it !"".

So guess who didn't get their settlement ?"
"I mean... Good on him for trying to do the right thing, assuming he was doing it for the right reason. But... maybe listen when someone is trying to tell you something. "
"A friend of mine works retail and she was ringing some stuff up for two ladies who spoke German. They were talking to each other and bad-mouthing the store. She interrupts and says in German to the effect of, ""My German is terrible but I can understand what you're saying."" Both ladies turned red."
That's fairly likely although it would still be a bit odd that only the one specific tire is the one getting damaged.
"I worked at a gas station that was on the campus of an international airport. We were super busy almost all the time because everyone that was returning their rental car would come to us to fill up, plus all the Uber and taxi drivers would come hang out in our parking lot while waiting for fares. 

There was this one old dude, at least 80, who still drove for Uber. Every day he would come in and buy a 20 oz monster, 2 packs of pall mall red 100s, and he’d ask for 2 packs of matches. One day he made an offhand comment about how caffeine and nicotine were the only things left that gave him joy. It was profoundly depressing. I hope he’s doing okay now. Nobody should have to work at that age. "
She could have an assigned spot at work or something so the kerb is always on one side.
Better to be safe and assume every single person you see from the parking lot all the way to the hiring manager is going to report their impressions of you to management. And definitely don't act like this dumbass.  
"AFAIK, it's because they are a bar and can't sell beers ""to-go"" like a grocery store or liquor store. The alcohol must be consumed on the premises and you can't leave with it, by opening the beer that makes it harder to do."
"This reminds me of when my sis got hired at a new coffee franchise that was opening. It's their first week open and they are getting slammed, and the staff being new is doing their best. I went to pick my sis up from work, getting there a bit early so I can grab a drink, and the lady in the line in front of me turns around and starts complaining to me about how slow and stupid the girl taking our orders was (my sis). I just snapped at her something like, ""they just opened this  week and considering this is my sister's first job I think she's doing pretty well, though I imagine the impatient customers are the hardest part of the job...."" she went beet red and didn't say another word to me. "
"&gt; undertands FLUENTLY 

I undertood that."
I’d have been petty and said ‘there was a sign and multiple things in the way of the door. There is no possible way for you to not have known the bathroom was out of order. You will have to pay for the damages you caused intentionally’ 
"As an extremely white looking Puerto Rican, I can confirm the joy of doing this to customers. There were two women who came through my line who I had helped find a bible in Spanish. The younger of the two is a semi-regular customer. She also speaks perfect English and prefers to use it in the store. The older woman was an aunt or her mother, I’m not sure which. She was a Maria evacuee, and was not in a good mood that day. I showed the older woman where the Bible selection was in our “Libros en español” área. She approached the line to pay telling the younger woman that I “wouldn’t know a Bible if it bit me on the ass” (she said it in Spanish, thinking I wouldn’t understand). She had come to my register and I continued the transaction in English. She again sald (in Spanish) something twblir needing to keep an eye out on my rear end for a copy of the Bible. As calmly as I could, I replied to her in Spanish. I told her that I used my eyes to read, not my ass, so I would have no issue recognizing a Bible. Then I gave her the total to pay for the book. (All of this was in Spanish)

Not the first time but definitely the most memorable. "
There used to be a TV show about stupid criminals that always made me laugh!  Some of the DUMB things they did were hysterical!
"Sorry, I can’t make sense out of the fourth paragraph at all. Whose girlfriend and where did she come from? Why is she talking to you? At no point does she seem to say anything related to the older co-worker so what would prompt the response of “she’s newer than me”?"
"Even so, if all he cares about is the application so they don't cut off his benefits he might as well at least be cordial and when someone says they are the manager ask for an application.  Easy peasy.  I just don't get why people are like this. "
"They've got the pap, they've got the Karen, but most of all they've got each other"
