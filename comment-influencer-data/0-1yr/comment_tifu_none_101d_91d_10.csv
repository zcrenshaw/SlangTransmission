You mean she didn't walk over and show her daughter how it's done? The internet lies.
"Nice zero tolerance. Kid hits your kid every day, no one does shit about it. The second he fights back, SUSPENDED. What a crock."
#LOOK MOM NO HANDS
Not sure how this is a TIFU. Honestly just a great story
UNSUSPECTING STUD GETS FUCKED BY HUNG ROOMMATE WHILE PRINT SHOP GIRL WATCHES
Props to your dad for trying to joke about it
"They shouldn't find better spots for the spare keys, they should just use each other's plant pots so the person trying to break in would have to know to use the other door."
Happy family torn apart by fowl play
He came. She went
"TL;DR Sent cousin to get wet wipes, she came back wet."
"you've gotta call her thunder thighs now, I don't make the rules"
"He was actually really cool about it.  I explained everything and apologized profusely and cleaned up the sandwich (pastrami on rye)  After he had calmed down and realized I wasn't a crazy lady, he found it pretty funny and wasn't mad.  We were outside in the area between their condos when Jenna came home.  We told her the story and she was cracking up.  I suggested they find better places for their spare keys because that is apparently a really common spot and next time I might not be around to throw a sandwich at a burglar."
"The zero tolerance shit kills me. It encourages bullies to do their thing because nothing ever happens until the victim fights back. If they do get caught, so what, they don't have to go to school. Win for them. Zero tolerance is code for zero liability for the school."
This story gets better if you date each other. No pressure.
"Could be worse, you could have been paying for tinder gold for 2 months for no matches."
We shall call him 'two-can-Sam' from now on...
"The mom left because he ejaculated. Had he not, I'm sure this situation would've happened."
"She must be pretty sensitive about her weight/being compared to her sister for her to snap at you that way... Of course people are going to be confused if they don't know that you're a twin (especially if their facial features are very similar).


I've had a total stranger come up and hug me, believing that I was my sister. Sometimes it's just difficult for people to tell."
Will need update when they're back down on the ground.
"We're gonna need some update on this OP.


Please."
"Now she'll wonder about all those calls from your contact named ""todd"""
"&gt;This is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs.

Man, I'm sure glad this story didn't end up where I thought it was going."
"Ah, ejaculating in front of the mom. Asserting your dominance."
Time to start introducing myself as my fat twin.
"That's your half-sister, not step-sister."
"If it makes you feel better, years ago I used to have to send emails from my phone because of how busy work was getting and I had no idea it included the name I gave my iphone.. 

My emails were ended with ‚Äúkind regards, ‚Äî-(my name) followed by ‚Äúsent from weasel dick enterprises iphone‚Äù"
Zero Tolerance rules are what leads to school shootings. change my mind.
You certainly helped clear more shit out of her life than she was expecting.
"Think its tine you and your dad spoke about some solid home truths.

A couple months woukd be enough time for your mum to figure out ""who she is"". Time for your dad to get his balls out of her purse and make the call hes been too afraid to make.

He doesnt want to split the family apart, but you're already divided.

V's family is in the exact same situation. This isnt some new millennial Brady Bunch shit. Time to call a spade a spade and get the paperwork filed.

Pull the plug while things are still somewhat amicable. Before too long your dad will start to resent the situation (if he isnt already, albeit silently) and that wont mean a respectful divorce. It's for the best really. Why go on pretending the family is something its not.

If your dad is worried about what to tell your younger brothers, put that on your mum. Her decision, her responsibility to explain it to them."
How did he react after an explanation and what kind of sandwich was it?
"Seems like everyone else here is ignoring the elephant in the room so I'm just gonna come right out and say it...

Braided stainless brake lines are a bad idea for a daily driver. Hard piped mains and rubber hoses to each caliper are a staple of the Auto industry for a reason. Rubber hoses are longer lasting, less likely to leak, AND cheaper than braided stainless flex hoses. Your sister just saved you from making your truck less reliable."
"my son did this when we had a Gulf War vet (with *terrible* PTSD) to our house for Thanksgiving.  We were enjoying our meal, and my son asked,  ""You were in the war??  Did you kill people??"""
Are you the head nurse?
"Her parents away, she's home all alone

She wiggles her crotch and looks toward the phone

Housesitting is boring, she lacks entertainment

She dials her man for some bedroom detainment

&amp;#x200B;

He enters the house and they waltz to the bed

But suddenly run to the sofa instead

The clothing goes flying

She's moaning and crying

The dogs look away as they're heavily sighing

&amp;#x200B;

Unknowingly though, her brother is sneaking

His footsteps not pounding, the floorboards not creaking

He sees them and shrieks and runs out with great force

His sis and her man playing cowboy and horse"
Don't make me admit the truth.
She probably sees more in you than she did in Hugh Jazzcock.
"USB PRANK GONE SEXUAL!!!!!!

Do you live in a model house? Maybe there's another one just like that in Iraq.
"""TIFU I taught my son that if someone punches you in the head every single day and they can't rely on authority to deal with it, you should punch them back and take care of it yourself."" Not a bad lesson to teach someone in this day and age tbh."
"Wait, how old are both of you?"
I think dad was afraid it was the vid HE had just watched playing on the radio

"Well, from the title I went into this with a different view than the ending. From creeped out to oddly wholesome in just a couple of paragraphs."
"As a Iraq war veteran I get annoyed when adults ask me that question; I've even got the question in an interview which I think is probably illegal.

I expect it from children though, they're curious and don't know better."

FTFY"
Come again?
Questions you didn't think you needed to tell you children not to ask...
"Bless you. You were 15 and this is the age of asking those kind of questions without knowing the consequence. Look on the good side, it taught you a lot and it's a damn good lesson to learn.. xx"
Well that‚Äôll teach her to knock next time
"""Aww, you're such a cute couple! How did you meet?""
""Well it all started when she broke into my apartment and threw a sandwich at me..."""
Thanks for clarifying that your sisters are female.
Oh my God! That‚Äôs disgusting! Your sister‚Äôs insta account of spandex booties. What account? Where did she post those?
"I mean if this is true...

I don't think you were the one that messed up your relationship. Sounds like she's been thinking about this for a while so this situation has basically been a ticking time bomb waiting to happen."
"Yeah I saw that going a different way..

Dad had a pretty good sense of humor about all of that."
this the most clickbait title in this suns history üòÇ
That's worse!
r/AccidentalAlabama?
are door locks not a thing?
I don't see the TIFU. This is how you teach your kids to deal with bullies.
TIL the perfect cover story for masterbation in the office.
"OP is busy right now, he‚Äôll get back to you later."
THIS is a VERY important question...

"In my line of work, I hear shit jokes regularly.  That was the first new one I've heard in a while."
Bro you're telling me you got home and a woman was waiting for you with a sandwich? I've dreamed of this.
"Hey man! Congrats on standing up for yourself.

Something I have learned is ‚Äúhurt people, hurt, people‚Äù 
so when you said that you think your bully comes from a rough home you‚Äôre probably right. But that still doesn‚Äôt give him the right to push that pain onto other people. 
A good bop in the head is something he needed and it‚Äôs a good thing he got it early in life.

Good luck with the rest of your healing from the surgery. The results are incredible!"
"Do you know what the true definition of relative humidity is??






It's the sweat running down the crack of your ass while you're fucking your cousin..."
"My cousin did this. He went to visit my grandma who lived out in the country and never locked the doors. She wasn‚Äôt home so he let himself in and chilled in the loungeroom. He noticed some kids toys but knew our other cousin and her kid had been staying there, so thought nothing of it. 

While he was waiting, decided to call his dad and asked where grandma was. He said she was at home. My cousin explained, not she wasn‚Äôt, because he was in her house and she wasn‚Äôt here. His dad asked if he was at her new place? Cousin had no idea what he was talking about. Turns out my grandma had moved recently and a new family with kids moved into her old place, the place my cousin had just let himself into.

He booked it out of there quick smart, and we never found out if the new owners realised someone had been in their house while they were out. I hate to think what would happen if they‚Äôd come home while he was there!"
"Things I have learned from r/tifu

It's a double pun because you can't fucking hear.
Perfect composure.
"Take my upvote, and please give that little dummy some kisses for me"
Text her and ask if she's done yet.
If it makes you feel better it really wasn't you that caused the divorce.
Apparently not. And apparently knocking is a foreign concept.
Poor guy's still waiting for his blowjob.
I've had tinder for 6 years. I've never got a match other than a few bots :(.

"Yeah, it‚Äôs weird. If my cousin asked me to get some wipes, and I found condoms instead, my first thought would be ‚Äúoh, she told me to look in the wrong place‚Äù not ‚Äúshe wants to bang‚Äù."

Check your gender settings...
"""Oh yeah, my twin is out of town for like 3 months. He did mention that he wanted to ask you out on a date when he gets back. You game?""

If she says yes, then you have 3 months to train."
At least you didn‚Äôt blow it
"Look at me

Some people would see this as an absolute win.
"There is a phenomenon that happens when siblings, that don't grow up together, end up being really attracted to one another when they meet up later in life. I'm not looking that one up on my work Computer, but it's a thing."
Unfortunately mine are correct :(.
So how are you going to explain your aversion to that couch next family gathering?
"""How's your skinnier twin?"" is the easy way to negotiate this sort of encounter."
That ship has sailed. Across an ocean of uncut dicks apparently.

"I call BS. Everyone knows strawberry things go in red packaging, not blue."
"You‚Äôre right. We probably couldn‚Äôt handle it. At least, not without *the attachment.*"
Sounds like you could have gotten away without anyone being the wiser if you just shut your mouth.
Well that‚Äôll teach her to ~~knock next time~~ join next time
You sure he wasn't just messing with you?
At the next family gathering will your sister assert dominance by proclaiming she saved you a seat on the couch?
"Yup it definitely taught me to try being less ‚Äúfunny‚Äù and snarky. It also opened my eyes as this was the closest I‚Äôve ever been to a real war (and civil wars like those are the worst). To be honest I still feel bad today for bringing that up. A and V broke up many years ago, and I‚Äôve moved to a new country myself, but still bugs me not being able to apologize."

"&gt;The zero tolerance shit kills me. It encourages bullies to do their thing because nothing ever happens until the victim fights back. If they do get caught, so what, they don't have to go to school. Win for them. Zero tolerance is code for zero liability for the school.

The problem with zero tolerance is that it leads to situations where one side (or both) decide they're going to get suspended anyway so they might as well earn it and a fight that could have ended after a few punches turns into one kid kicking the absolute shit out of the other kid because they're going to get suspended anyway"

If your daughter threw your phone at you downstairs how did your wife hold it up for you to see upstairs when you entered the room?
"I received a lot of supportive messages from women trying to explain that men care more about dick size than women do. Some were baffled that men care at all. 

It took me a while to process this, but I realised that my ex knows that I‚Äôve had exes with bigger tits, smaller waist, bigger ass etc and that‚Äôs something that she‚Äôs had to deal with.

I like small tits, big tits, droopy tits, plastic tits. I would be baffled if my ex was affected by the fact that I‚Äôve had sex with girls with different tits - some that she may consider better but I just consider different. Does that make sense?

She genuinely seems to enjoy sex with me and everything is great, so who cares if his dick was bigger? Ok I still care a bit but I‚Äôm working on it."

You did the right thing honestly. The school is in the wrong in this case. But be proud that your son defended himself.

"I think it would be too awkward to say anything now. The best option would be to play dumb, power through and have sex with her a couple hundred times. Then slowly start easing her into how the relationship is not going to work and transition back to being cousins."
I am a dad. So that works.
"Went better than my friend. I swapped my number and his mum's number in his phone. When I left at the end of a night of heavy drinking he texted me and said ""Have you two gone to bed? Mind if I join ;)"" or something similar. Obviously his mum texted back saying ""I think you have the wrong number"". His response was something like ""No, I definitely have the right one. You two gone for sexy times? Want a threeway?""  


I can't remember exactly what happened with his mum after that but I know he was really fucking pissed with me the next morning. It was great fun."

He bent Tina over the side of the bed.

Tina did scream with joy and delight,

And then with a gush and a glorious moan,

‚ÄúI thought you'd hold out!"" moaned Tina so sadly, ""I tried but I couldn't, try not to feel badly!""

Tina reached in the nightstand which sat by the bed, 
The bed she sat in with now unconscious Ted, 
She pulled out a vibrator and flipped on its power, 
She gurgled and moaned for the next quarter hour,

She gurgled and moaned, and she gurgled some more,

She looked in his eyes and she said with a smile,

"I'm calling BS on this entire story. We've uncovered something else entirely, a coverup of preposterous proportions.  
  
OP and Chad have been hooking up for a while now. What OP didn't mention was that the accident happened while Chad was on his way to her house for a night of Jolt Cola^¬Æ fueled passion.  
  
Enter Chad's wife Jenny. She becomes suspicious that the accident happened on the opposite direction from where he was supposed to be going. She installs cameras and microphones in the house to try and catch Chad.   
  
OP then arranges a night of grab ass with her audio messages. Chad in his horned up state of euphoria begins cleaning house. That's when he finds the microphones. Panic set in, he knows he's busted. He calls OP and they have to come up with a story and quick. Then genius strikes.   
  
Chad's wife is an avid Redditor. She often recounts hilarious posts on /r/TIFU. They carefully craft their story as ""evidence"" that this was just a simple case of mistaken identity. It's nearly perfect, but they weren't counting on one thing: Me.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have presented the facts of the case here today as they are. It is up to decide what to do with those facts. But before you make that decision I ask you to think about all of the victims in the defendant's wake of destruction. There's Chad's wife of course, who's worst fears came true, tearing her family apart. Lets not forget the good people of Reddit, who waded through paragraphs of lies and deceit, played like a fiddle to cover up these heinous crimes. And there's the biggest victim of all.. AJ.

I used to live in an area where I could hear a bunch of loons calling to each other from the different lakes and ponds. It was great to play that record, later in the summer, and hear them trying to figure out who the new guy in the neighborhood was."

And what I mean by that is no matter how good or how bad a relationship is. If it doesn‚Äôt work out just examine it and say hey, this went good, and this went bad. That way when you start talking to someone you already have a step ahead if this is is gonna be a good fit. But most importantly, love yourself. Be happy for yourself. Don‚Äôt let this world hold you down for a second, life is far to short to be spent crying over some person that didn‚Äôt work out. We‚Äôre all scared to get hurt. But if you spend your time and energy making you the happiest person you know. The right people will find you when the time is right.

"Barely a fuck up in my books, you made an honest comment in an environment where it was entirely plausible that she was aware that the condoms were causing the blockage. Great story though!"
"Sounds like your mom is trying to ""have her cake and eat it too"" while not having to share any of it.

Your dad needs to realize that this isn't a fling or a journey of self discovery anymore and it is only a matter of time before even your little brothers know, which will likely be much sooner than you did and may be a little harder to process.

And the tough news that your dad needs to swallow, is that your mom may love him, but is clearly NOT in love with him anymore. Whether she was unaware of her sexuality in the past or is finding out something new about herself, it is not ok to treat your father as a failsafe. And she isn't exploring her sexuality so much as she is exploring a new relationship that happens to be with a woman (and may be learning that she is bi or homosexual in the process). That is a big difference and is not fair to your father given that she isn't comfortable with him doing the same thing. (Also this may be a little conspiracy theorist of me so take it with a grain of salt, but as a stay at home mom and I don't think I know Vs job, financially they may be unsecure enough that neither would have a fiscal plan to be together and may be looking to keep the status quo for as long as possible and divorce/separation may ruin these plans.)

Regardless it looks like your dad needs to have a gutcheck moment and figure out what he wants and make it known. Divorce is never ideal, but if done amicably it is much better than living with an ongoing affair and building resentment for the other person which is good for no one and will only build future drama. 

Wish you the best in this situation and sorry you and your family is going through this"

So either the bully has a great time away from school or a horrible experience with their parents disciplining them. The latter leads to anger, which surprise surprise, gets taken out on the victim all over again. The former shows them that there's no consequences to their actions.

"I came to similar realizations when porn convinced me that my size was an issue.  My wife explained why she specifically loves mine even though she's had bigger and ultimately, I came to understand and appreciate that she chose me based on the overall package, not just my dick."

At least they aren't sending them to his girl.
Wait...you guys were trying to do what?? Light coffee creamer in mid-air?
"It doesn't really make sense. Why after growing up together wouldn't she just think, whoops, they forgot what was in the box. Since when us a box of condoms and an old dvd considered a come on? It's way too cryptic for people who've known each other their whole lives.  And why would she say yes?"
That man is a *Legend*
Seriously. I don't get why people leave that shit on 24/7.
"People confuse me and my sister all the time, we're not even twins. Even if you were a different body shape than them or maybe didn't wear your hair the same way, you'd be like ""oh that person I know looks really different,"" she shouldn't let it get her down. I have heard that eating disorders with twins are very common though, so it's probably a sore spot."
Yea after he got out to his truck.
"Why do you have to sneak in the house, dogs don‚Äôt like you?"

Be a big girl and unblock him and tell him it was for a gig and just let it slide. I am sure with all the emojis that he was just messing around. His wife would notice a large amount of money missing...

"as a gay man, this is very very true and cannot be stressed enough."
"Yea, this is what I want to know too. If this has been going on for so long, and had such a severe consequence for OP's kid, were any charges pressed?"
"Fuck the wife. 

I‚Äôm not good at advice."
A little bit of both
"Explosive crying is what encouraged my bullies.  Explosive anger is what made them stop.  

When my mental anguish eclipsed my fear and natural aversion to pain, I lashed out.  I wasn't trying to win.  I was intent on making everybody lose.

"As I am reading all of this Sweet Home Alabama started playing in the sky and as I looked up ill be damned if Lynyrd Skynyrd didnt appear like jesus in the clouds and started jamming next to John Denver who tipped his hat to me and rode off firing pistols from atop a mighty steed and all that is still more believable than this this made up story.

I was totally expecting him to walk into his sister having sex with the dog. Barely could finish masturbating when I realized she didn't
"Similar thing happened to me in middle school, I used to mention things about abuse and assault and even wrote it in my stories as a plot device (the absolute worst). When I said a particular ""r"" word around a friend of mine she patiently asked me to stop and told me why. I made the effort to stop and though I slipped up a few more times, I eventually erased it from my vocabulary. I've had several more female friends and acquaintances tell me stories of their attack or go quiet when the topic was brought up and it hurt to see their pain and how some of the nicest people I knew went through terrible things. I refuse to say it now, seeing as how you could have no idea who has been through it (male or female) and what it takes to recover. 

I'm glad we both learned. :)"

You had Aural Sex.
Was on tinder as a girl looking for girls once and asked a guy why he was using it and he had done the same thing. Thanked me for pointing it out.
Dude that really sucks your hearingwill never be 100% agin. at least anytime you forget to do something for her you can just be like *ohsorry babe i didnt hear you my bad*
"Buddy, I've got to say this here. The situation sucks. I get it. But it isn't your fault. Regret it hurt someone, but don't beat yourself up.  You had no way to catch this. 
And she might be upset at your dad, but that brief conversation I can say two things about his view on it. 1. He didn't approve of M's actions, and 2. Wanted him to stop. He kept his friends secret, but he seemed to advocate that M needed to acknowledge his mistake. It's not an easy position to be in, and is easy to mess up. 

This isn't your fault. It was an unfortunate accident."
"He lick, she kick"
Lol imagine what he's thinking
When did you transition?
"I was investigated by the Feds once.

This was years ago when I managed the mail services division of a very large company, and some absolute muppet in print services created an enormous mailing (hundreds of thousands of envelopes) and my division metered them (put the postage on the envelopes), QCd the addresses, and sent them out.

What this absolute muppet had neglected to tell me was that there were ALSO hundreds of thousands of business reply mail envelopes (which are prepaid postage by the company) WITHIN the envelopes my division had mailed out.  My name was on the BRM account with the USPS, so when all these BRM envelopes started coming in and there wasn't money in the account to cover it, the local postmaster called me to let me know we owed them several hundred thousand dollars.

Okay, NBD, this kind of thing happens.  I'll get a check cut and problem solved.

However, no one had approved the BRM envelopes.  Not the division sending the mailing, not the print shop who had printed and stuffed the envelopes, not me, who actually mailed the envelopes.

So an interdepartmental pissing match starts within the company over whose budget is going to absorb the expense.  It goes on for *weeks*.  Meanwhile, the BRM account that *my name* is on is accruing more and more unpaid postage.

The postmaster finally tells me she's going to have to get a Postal Inspector involved.  And as the USPS contact within my company, I was legally on the hook for getting this money paid.

USPS Inspectors are legit Federal agents.  They can and will fuck with your life just as bad as any FBI investigation will.

I finally ended up having to set up a meeting with my waayy higher ups, the postmaster, and the postal inspector to make it clear to them that I was facing Federal fraud charges if someone didn't cut this goddamn check already.

The check was cut.

Having the Federal government breathing down your neck is a special butt-clenching type of fear that you don't truly appreciate until it happens."
You did her a favour
Hey props to you for swallowing your pride. It must have sucked at first but I‚Äôm sure the lump in the back of your throat is gone now. Congrats!

"As someone with severe pectus excavatum like OPs son, the pain of getting the surgery/bar moving and having to be readjusted is beyond excruciating... That kid is tough as nails having to go through that let alone getting bullied throughout the process.

"First, from the daughter of another Vietnam Vet, to you, Missy, and your Mom, my heartfelt condolences üïØüïØ We lost my dad in 2003, for much of the same reasons üòû I still miss that man every single day, some days are harder than others, find what helps you, and you‚Äôll get through. 

Second, I BAWLED there at the end, as I‚Äôm sure you did as well when you realized. I don‚Äôt know if it would help, but maybe playing it for her every now and then wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing. She is grieving as well, and it‚Äôs her ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs‚Äù voice too, so she may find comfort in it as well. 

I only suggest it, because my experience‚Äôs with my cat, Garfield. Garfield is one of our three, living, cats, and is the son of our cat Maximus, who we lost in February 2018. Garfield went through a major depression after, and seemed to worsen when we moved, and his ‚ÄúBig Daddy‚Äù Max didn‚Äôt come with us. My husband found a video of us talking to Max, and him responding with meows, so he played it, and Garfield perked up. He was SO excited to hear his ‚ÄúDaddy Cat‚Äù who had been gone for a good six months at that time, he started meowing back to the video. We play that video for him a couple of times a week now. He‚Äôs perked back up, not as depressed, and has started interacting with our other cats again (we had four until we lost our Max. Now we just have the three). It‚Äôs been good for him, even though it can be hard sometimes, it seem to help him too. Good luck, and much love."

"Wait, wait wait. So your son was punched and had to go get surgery to put it back. So the bully doesn't even get punished for that? BUT Your son gets suspended for decking out the kid for giving him surgery needed injuries. LITERALLY SUE THE FUCKING SCHOOL. Like Idf care what country or state you live in, its 1000% the schools fault for even allowing that to happen."

"It is ok to have standards and boundaries. You need to *boldly* announce them.

 Tell your mom ""You are an adult and free to live your life, but don't force me to watch you torture my father. Do not bring your lover to the house your husband and children live in. Show some decency and respect."""
"- Yes, and you call it an assignment despite the fact that it's obviously gay porn. 
- One thing I - excuse for for one second. 
- Of course."
"I tell my son (13) and daughter (7) that they will never be in trouble for defending themselves no matter what the school says, but I didn't always take that stance.

I used to tell them that under no circumstances were they to hit other kids, until my son came home in tears with anger...a kid moved to their school who had ""issues"" and he was basically riding rough shod over the teachers and kids in his class, which up to then had been in perfect harmony, apparently they were all colouring in and the shithead said ""this pen is blue"" to which my son loomed up and said ""it's grey"" ...long story short, shithead explodes and attacks my kid, having to be dragged off him by the teacher as he tried to strangle him. 

I got a call from the school; ""Mr Bollicks, there was a wee incident in school today, shithead got upset and there was a little bit of an altercation, nothing to worry about, just letting you know."" So I think ""OK I'll talk to kidder when he gets home"" 

Then I get the full story, so I told him ""Remember when I told you never to hit? Forget it all, Dad was being too soft, the minute someone puts their hands on you, you light them up on the spot...OK?"" 

""OK Dad.""

Now, I was an amateur boxer in my day and also did some Judo and 6 months of JJ, so I know a little bit when it comes to unarmed combat, obviously I have a great respect for martial arts and had been showing my son a few things so he had the tools in his box should he need them, and self discipline, hoping to give him a bit of knowledge before sending him to a gym or Dojo. 

FFWD 3 weeks, I get a call from the headmistress; ""Mr Bollicks there has been a serious incident resulting in BabyBollicks punching shithead to the ground, this sort of behaviour is unacceptable in our school and we are suspending him for 3 days"" I asked what led to this happening as I don't think my wee man would instigate violence; ""Well...shithead hit him with a chair and tried to strangle him again, and we will be dealing with it..."" ""Let me stop you there, I told my son that if anyone was to put their hands on him again that he was to let them have it,  fat from being I  trouble,  he is going to McDonald's tonight and the cinema, also you realise that the action of putting both hands around someone's neck is usually a stark warning of serious intent to harm? In an 8 year old that is terrifying, and maybe shithead needs moved to your unit where he can get the care he needs rather than disrupting 32 other kids who get along fine? I'm going to the board with this"" 

In the end it all disappeared and my kids know that dad always has their back, so double down OP, fuck that bully."
You're pretty damn weird to do that not gonna lie.
"I called them too, but they aren't picking up :|"
"Lmao sometimes they don‚Äôt come up to him or it‚Äôs in a loud crowded place, but the number one reason which I‚Äôm guilty of doing as well is because sometimes you can‚Äôt remember fully if this is a person you met one time and can‚Äôt remember them so you play it off and get out of there as quick as possible.  Shit gets awkward when you say ‚Äúno sorry I think you know my twin‚Äù and they reply with ‚Äúno I met you ________‚Äù"

Why would your twin not inform them first? Like does he just look at them strangely and wait for them to leave him alone? Lmao
