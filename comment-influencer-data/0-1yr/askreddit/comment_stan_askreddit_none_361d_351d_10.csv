"When I say the teachers at our school were incompetent, I *mean* incompetant. They would leave us and be in the staffroom watching TV most of the time, which left us kids to our own devices. So a group of students gathered in the auditorium one day and had some sort of seance/ritual where they drew a huge stanic symbol on the floor and cut up the stage curtains and used them as robes. They took everything from the cafeteria, including the poor lunch lady, in order to lure in the stan. The teachers were only alerted when students went for lunch and found the cafeteria suspociously empty. By the time the teachers found the auditorium, it was like a war scene."
Female pop stars and the whole ‘stan’ culture fan base associated with that is pretty toxic
