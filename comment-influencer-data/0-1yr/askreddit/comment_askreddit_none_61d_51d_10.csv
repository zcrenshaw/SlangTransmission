&gt;Oh fucking shut up, it was fun and crass. That does not equate to some bullshit about how white mean are oppressed. 

The fuck are you even talking about? I loved CBFD, I never said it equated to ""white men being oppressed"". 

I'm saying it's no longer acceptable to mock anyone except white men. I wouldn't mind it if not for the double standards and hypocrisy. No group should be off limits from being mocked."

"That’s right people, downvote this. Your generation has it sooooo hard. Jobs fell into people’s laps during the Great Depression and all of the other economic recessions. Learn some basic fucking economic history, Jesus fucking Christ.

Now quit whining and o apply for more jobs, quit waking up at noon in your parents basements “because life is just boohoo so tough”."
This is also a personal conversation between 2 acquainted people. So maybe there should be a bit of consideration when discussing movies. Movies specifically well known because of their plot twists.
Why not just do it now then? I have no sympathy for that at all.

3. Better exclusive titles, at least on the PS4. 
4. I grew up with PlayStation, so it has my favorite games from my childhood.

"Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with the all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, that's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier
Then only for a minute (only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go"

I'm not a fan of a lot of what trump does and pushes for. But Im probably going to vote for him in 2020. Why? The democratic party seems to have gone completely off the deep end with every candidate seemingly trying to be more radical than the last. I also like the fact that trump pisses everybody off.

Not really.
It's not competing well. I've not seen alot of review on it yet but I'm doubt that Apple is pulling that off. The reality is Apple is looking at how they have been overcharging and saying it will work better too.

"I was hella enjoying this but I feel like you sort of lost the meaning here at this point. Why the fuck do they suddenly want to be naked?

No one wants to be naked, it's not just social stigma it's just natural for humans to prefer to be clothed and covered in most environments. 

I thought that was the point, now it just ended up being kind of stereotypical being naked is powerful, the choice not to wear clothes, as if they just took on the males agenda after vanquishing them."
Pornhub thinks otherwise.

"Looking at their post history they do post on gender critical, which is a pretty bad sign, but no I was referring to the comment itself. It builds on the implication that trans people, specifically trans women, are forcing or ""tricking"" unwilling  cis people into having sex with them, which is a transphobic misconception because obviously the vast majority of trans people don't want to have sex with somebody who wouldn't consent to it. The discussion was about whether or not people's dating preferences can be transphobic, but certain individuals sneakily change the goal posts by proclaiming that nobody owes sex to trans people, which was not the topic of the discussion and is something that no trans person said in the comments above."
I'm aware of that. I'm just saying the vagina is definitely not a closed system.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because who is the audience and what guarantee do you have that they aren't taking it seriously *and* won't parrot it back to someone else who does? Obviously you can't control that, so the question is, where does your responsibility end?

I believe this the crux of the issue. It seems to me that the argument being made here is just that on an individual level you should be respectful to everyone. I think that's a pretty fair general position to take but I think there are some nuances, where I believe I would start to agree less and less with this, and I think this next sentence is where I would start to push back bit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And dehumanization can pretty much be defined as mocking

I'd agree that some mocking is dehumanizing, and maybe I'd go as far to say mocking is usually dehumanizing. I think the first counter example that comes up is a roast. Comedy Central used to do those all the time. It seems to me that context matters and that this is probably the strongest case for a context that.

By this mocking definition would you agree that late night comedy hosts dehumanize Trump? I've certainly heard an argument about power dynamics (Trump obviously having the power here), but those arguments only seem to justify why it's ok to dehumanize Trump (I could be understanding them wrong though but it seems this dynamic is very crucial to people leaning left).

Or less of a joke. I think it was 2016 or 17 where Bernie Sanders made a comment about how the change of healthcare Trump was doing would kill millions. A Bernie Sanders fan then shot up a congressional baseball game. Personally I don't think Bernie Sander has any culpability. However, it seems to me I could use a very similar argument to at least criticize Sanders and at worst find him culpable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also present an argument why I disagree with this line of thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

To start I think we agree at the destination we want. People to not dehumanize or be mean to eachother, and love one another. 

My criticism is that a lot of these things like political correctness or banning jokes based on content rather than intent leads to these words, phrases, and topics to being sensitize, rather than desensitized. This in turn sharpens the tools of the hateful people. Bans on the stuff doesn't change the hearts or minds of these people it only gives them a more potent tool kit to attack. If no one cared if people used the F words (that degrades homosexuals), then online I wouldn't have scores of 16 year olds on COD calling me that word. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*slightly tangential point: Isn't comedy usually based on pushing back on what is acceptable?

&amp;#x200B;

If pressed in real life I don't think these kids would hate homosexuals based on their sexual identities. I think they are just using the word because it's prominent effect at eliciting negative emotions. Therefore my contention is that the best way to deal with this is to ignore or looks (while saying in your mind ""really that's what you think is funny? sad). I think this stigmatizing words, jokes, and things, making them stronger in the hands of people who haven't and won't necessarily change their hearts with censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I think it should be ok to make any type of joke you want in a private setting as long as you also add a message or disclaimer to go along with the video. In this regard the impressionable people still get the right message, while we try to slowly reduce the stigma around this stuff. Jokes targeted at someone's intelligence aren't nearly as bad as ones based on gender or race, and I think the utopia we both see has all 3 of these things equally destigmatized."
Or maybe the biggest clue is answering a question directed at non Canadians and openly admitting that I wasn't from canada?

"Try using one of those vibrators that you can insert and just leave in till you're done. Leave it running until you finally get off (even if it takes an hour or two) and do this often.
