"The last time we had a post like this, didn't a commentor kill Stan Lee? Playin' with fire..."
I specifically remember someone mentioning Stan Lee in one of these threads just hours before his death was announced.
"That said, at a certain point you do have to protect yourself. (Prepare for some complicated backstory RIP)

Not using any real names here.

My friend Marie got out of an abusive relationship, met a new guy Stan who seems nice, is great with her toddler, everything. Stan is still in contact with his ex-wife Anna, even after 5+ years divorced. Anna ended up in an abusive relationship after him. Extreme asshole, has hospitalised her multiple times, isolates her from everyone, low-key gang/mafia shit, known to the cops and all that. William. Anna keeps threatening to leave but never does, classic honeymoon &gt; tension &gt; aggressive &gt; honeymoon cycle. Really really textbook abuse. Marie can't bear to leave another person in an abusive relationship after what she went through, does her best to be friends with her even with the awkward emotionally-dependent ex-wife thing and everything.. talks Anna through it, reminds her of the awful stuff he's done when she's in the lovey honeymoon phase, offers to let her stay with them if she needs a place, will pay for her plane ticket to their state, helps her find work to apply for here, everything.

One night Marie gets a phone call at work from Anna screaming and crying, driving around the city lost at night, saying that William is going to kill her after a huge fight, hysteric. Stan and Marie are trying to get her to go to the cops and stay there, or to get on a plane and come stay with them, not to go back to the house. William calls up Stan as well, and graphically describes how he's going to rape Anna with a knife, strangle and resuscitate her over and over, and that he'll come after Stan and Marie and her kid if they interfere. He knows their address somehow. Anna stops answering her phone, Stan is self-harming from worry about everyone, Marie is trying not to pass out from her heart condition, cops haven't heard anything, complete clusterfuck.

Anna messages them back like two days later saying everything is fine and barely acknowledges what happened. Says William is fine now and he's sorry and she doesn't need to leave, goes back to low-key flirting at Stan and trying to be best friends with Marie. Completely going back to the honeymoon phase.

Marie's still trying to be there if Anna really needs help, but she can't deal with the stress it puts on their family and the risk to her son, and she's told Anna that. If she really wants out they'll help, but they can't afford to get dragged into the drama cycle of it.

TL; DR: put on your own oxygen mask first."
That and these threads pop up weekly.  I've seen Stan Lee mentioned in threads like this for years.  Eventually it was going to be right.
