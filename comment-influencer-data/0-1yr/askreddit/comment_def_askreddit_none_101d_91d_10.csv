Letting young kids stay outside playing for hours until the street lights come on without knowing where they are. It’s not really f’d up but it’s def not normal now.
"Freshman year, linguistics. Professor was an overweight Russian guy with a heavy accent, prob in his mid late 30s. Had a habit of sitting on the desk in the front of the room while lecturing.

One day, class begins and I notice his fly is open and it seems he's going commando bc there def a fleshy patch visible. I'm looking around the room and see many others who seem to have notice but no one wants to embarrass the guy since we barely know him and it's only a couple weeks into the semester. As he walks back and forth lecturing his nut sack is slowly making itself visible, like someone slowly blowing a bubble with bubblegum. Front row is mostly girls and I can see they are a mixture of horrified and barely controlled laughter. Still no one can bring themselves to say a word about it. 

Finally he makes his move...He's boosts himself onto the front desk, plops down, and the back pressure created by his mass makes his balls burst forth from his unzipped fly into the open air like a breaching whale... He doesn't notice, or at least acts as though he doesn't notice... He continues the rest of the lecture as if nothing is amiss. I cannot fathom how he had no reaction or awareness that his balls are on display at seated face level about 8ft from the front row of students. Class ends and everyone bolts out of the room with mixed looks of disgust, myrth, and shock. Would have loved to have seen the professors reaction when he later finally realized he was hanging crumpet for some unknown amount of time."
"Not sure it this fits here. Was working in East Africa for a few years, there are some very beautiful and isolated places to go explore end enjoy. Always in respect to the customs and culture of the area of course. The national park closest to us didn't have any fences/boundaries, it had all of the African wild animals you could think off. (Could be classified as a rural area).  And the rangers (not sure what to call them) was very vigilant in protecting both the animals and the people living close by. Most wild animals are very smart, and very few would wander close to people. The locals also had their way of dealing with the animal's. For example, one night I woke up because of very loud drums and shouting. This was not out of the ordinary in the area I lived in, but it was coming from the area where there are no houses, closest to the park. It was during the dry season and the elephants wanted to eat some of the juicy green vegetation close to the people's homes. There was a water spring. Elephant's tend to be very destructive, and this particular male group had a very aggressive bull. So the locals were making noise to keep them away from the community.

Now on to my scary experience. The accommodation I was using at that time didn't have any indoor plumbing, so if you needed to use the facilities, you have to walk about 20 meters to a communal longdrop. It's very scary to walk alone at night, so usually I just limited my fluid intake during the early evening. But on that particular night my bladder was adamant, so eventually I convince myself to go out. I'm not sure if the noise a hyena makes is well known by a lot of people. Yes they do laugh like in the 'lion king' movie, but sometimes they make this 'oohOOH' sound. They are able to move very quietly, sometimes you'll smell them before you see or hear them. So as I'm about to squat down I hear 'oohOOH', right outside the longdrop. It would probably have been the most appropriate shit my pants moment in my life. In previous month's hyenas bothered the locals and even dragged a young (5jr) child away by its feet (the child survived). They are very opportunist like that and like to scavenge in the communities garbage sometimes. But they haven't been spotted in a while, so it was thought that they move on. Guess not. I'm not completely sure how long I was standing in that smelly longdrop, but eventually I just made a mad dash for my place waving my flashlight like crazy. Probably not the best thing to do at that moment, but I was def not thinking straight. When I was safe again, I turned around and could see a whole pack of them with their eyes reflecting the light. Bedpans made a lot more sense after that."
This is like the most true shit ive read on this thread so far lmao. Some of those old cats just play Chess ALL DAY and it def shows.
"It would def be down to him and Teddy Roosevelt.  


I'd like to see Nick Offerman as Roosevelt and Bryan Cranston as Jackson go at it till one of them dies horrifically."
"Hooooly shit that’s def stomach churning and gruesome! Thanks for the details. I am stuck on #1 and #2. Like, what? How? Why?!! Some people are totally insane. In no universe is it ever a good idea to dismember your daughter (seems like a lot of work to me) or molest your child. Christ almighty. Appreciate your insight!"
