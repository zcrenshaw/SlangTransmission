"Im a 26 year old only-child and I def understand your daughter’s feelings. Starting school sucked, hated people touching my stuff, hated other people not letting me touch their stuff (hypocritical but comes with the only child everything is for me mentality). That feeling never really goes away, you just get used to it. 

Don’t worry about it though, she’ll appreciate being an only child later when she learns how her peers have to share the remote and food at home."
"Ugh. I just remembered that my phone auto-unlocks at home. Maybe I'll be turning that feature off when there are people over. I don't have any nudes (of myself or others) on my phone, but def. pictures that no one else needs to pilfer. "
"We live in Southern California &amp; this was our situation for years with our best friend, it’s pointlessly expensive to live on your own. We only parted ways because he wanted to get a feel for living on his own for once (he’s 32 &amp; never has so its understandable) &amp; we wanted to stay with family so we can save to renovate a van, but we miss him dearly &amp; hope to buy a piece of land we can all live on together (albeit in separate homes). 
    
Our children love him like another parent or really close uncle, in fact, our youngest has even cried a few times while being held by his grandfather until he was taken away by said friend (funny/sad moments). He’s a lifelong very friend for sure. We def. got a few sideways glances in public &amp; suspicious questions from family/friends ourselves, but it’s whatever- he would take out the trash, fix things around the house with my fiancé, replenish the water, &amp; keep me company during the day (because he worked nights while fiancé worked days), even helped me with the kids; I cooked &amp; cleaned, washed towels for the house, organized their chaos; my fiancé paid the bills, grocery shopped, &amp; helped me clean, &amp; we all shared the cost of groceries/water/bills &amp; never fought about anything or got petty. 

Obviously there were cons, he’s like a whirlwind of chaos (I recently cleaned his new apartment for him so he could focus on some other things), but there were way more pros. The major exchange was the comfort we all provided one another, I’m now convinced humans aren’t supposed to be so secluded. Haha"
Def believing you
