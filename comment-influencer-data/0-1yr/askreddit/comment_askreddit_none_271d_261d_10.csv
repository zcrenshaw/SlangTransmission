"Error.

Man has inalienable rights as a natural right that have not derivation form the constitution.   One of the opposing arguments against the bill of rights was the fear that codifying them in ink and constitution would allow the government an avenue by which to deprive man of these rights."

"The long standing practice of pasteurising milk is not due to health concerns with raw milk, but because it lets dairy farmers feed their cows crap (industrial farming) and blast them full of antibiotics (big pharma). In fact, raw milk is actually SAFER to drink than pasteurised milk (so long as the cow as healthy), the microorganisms in raw milk will attack pathogens that would cause us harm. In pasteurised milk, you kill off all pathogens found in the milk, but you kill the bacteria that would kill the pathogens as well, so if it were to be exposed to any new pathogen, it would thrive without anything keeping it in check. The microorganisms in milk are designed to keep it healthy enough for babies (with an extremely weak immune system) to eat, not designed so that it's a dice roll any time you need to nourish yourself.

"Most of John Wayne (the most American American of all time) 's biggest movies were literal Westernizations of Japanese Samurai movies; The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, literal direct copy; the first Star Wars movies are remakes of a couple of Akira Kurosawa movies; Desperado with Antonio Banderas is Hollywood paying the original director to remake his own movie. 
They've been doing it for decades. "
"Double-standards much?

&gt;time travel, don't want to cause any paradoxes or break the universe

An RTD finale literally featured a machine called ""Paradox machine"" whose purpose was to rip a hole and cause a paradox. The word was literally said more times in an RTD finale than *any* Moffat finale! Or perhaps his series 4, where the setup was a universe breaking and they had to stop it?

&gt;BEETHOVEN! PANDORICA!

Beethoven wasn't Moffat and Pandorica is generally highly rated as a finale, matching or outdoing most other finales.

"Because they're the great unequalizer.  The more you feel a need for personal power, the more likely you are to purchase one, and the less the rest of society wants you to have one.  As with political power, the people I'd like to see with guns are the ones that don't want them."

"I forget the official word, but stacking votes during elections. Usually by democrats, they‚Äôll hire a bus full of people (usually illegal immigrants) and go to a bunch of polling places and cast their votes. It‚Äôs so common that candidates who don‚Äôt do it have to adjust their predicted numbers to account for the extra ones by the other side, in order to get accurate predictions about how they‚Äôll perform. It‚Äôs all over California. "

"I think you mean Bruce. And the fact that his name is Bruce should be enough to answer your question.

I don't care one way or the other but we need to decide as a nation if being an innie or an outie determines where you poop or nah. Because if someone can claim to be a woman but still has dangly bits and that's enough to let them into the women's room, then what's the point in having a women's room in the first place?

We either care or we don't. And if Bruce can deuce in the ladies' crapper instead of the laddies, then Mildred better STFU when Big Hairy Mike comes strolling in with a colon full of chili dogs."

"The terms of discussion are important.   


If we are talking about culture, we should talk about culture.  


If he meant to say culture, why did he say race? Why make the conversation increasingly more difficult to have by using words you don't mean and conflating terms?  


Also, no, I don't think he was doing what you generously point out, which i would agree with. He specifically said ""the influence of race in the world"" and ""sweden was definitely better when it was more white"". It is that former part that racially charges the latter beyond doubt.

Lmfao. Compatibility settings aren't some secret high tier fix for everything. And the game **will** still crash even with these settings on. It's not a magic fix.
