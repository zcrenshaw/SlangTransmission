"I was a BLINK (BLACKPINK fan) when I was younger and holy shit is it nasty. Yes, K-Pop. Calm your tits. They're so toxic and I sometimes listen to the group's music but I don't consider myself a BLINK or a stan anymore."
"Various songs by Eminem. Specifically, Stan at the current time."
Sebastian Stan
OH MY GOD THAT IS MY STAN SONG AND MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL TIME I SWEAR TO GOD HOLY SHIT I LOVE YOU
"It's funny you say that because when the concept of Spider-Man was shown to the publishers at Marvel they told Stan that a spider based superhero wouldn't become popular because of how much people are afraid of/hate spiders. But look at him now, one of the most popular superheroes ever. And my personal all time favorite I might add"
Stan is such a great character.  One of my favorites in the show.
"I'm not sure if this counts but ghosts, it would be pretty cool if Stan Lee could make ghost cameos in MCU movies. Man I miss that guy"
"You know what, Stan, if you want me to wear 37 pieces of flair, like your pretty boy over there, Brian, why don't you just make the minimum 37 pieces of flair?"
The cold introduction to Stan set the tone for the rest of the show. They got atmosphere perfect a lot in The Americans.
