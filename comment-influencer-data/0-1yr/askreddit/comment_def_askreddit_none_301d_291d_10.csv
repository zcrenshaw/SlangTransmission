"Not the guy you asked but I knew a girl who was into non-con. We would be getting it on and she would say no, not explicitly but in a sorta teasing playful way or she would suggest she wanted me to do something but resist when I tried. The first few times she pretty much told me what to do to get her to say yes, usually choking or spanking or something like that.

It was a little uncomfy at times to navigate those situations but it was all done in a very over the top manner. It felt more like I was playing a character in a porn than actually raping someone (def couldn't have done it if that was the case)."
"You wait at restaurants too long for service. Not blaming you, so def speak up sooner."
This happened to me too I got the definitions confused and I thought virgin meant you'd had sex.  My cousins said Jpopimpin777 is def a virgin and I angrily told them I was NOT! which of course made them laugh even harder. I was like 7.
I died 8 in a row. Def thought it was a rigged meme until then lol.
