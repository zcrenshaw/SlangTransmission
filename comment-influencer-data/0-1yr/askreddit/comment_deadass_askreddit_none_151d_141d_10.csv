"Dumbass white girl in my history class was convinced that 9/11 was just called that because 911 is the emergency line. She deadass never believed that it was nicknamed that based off of the date. 

After the history tried to explain it to her, her response was something like “but 9/11 happened in September, not in 9.  9 isn’t even the name of a month” and everyone went into silence after that"
