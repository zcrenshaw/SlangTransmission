"Tbf, most of the second half with the adults kind of undid the scary that was built up in the first part with the kids. The only scary part in the second half was the flashback scene of Stan getting trapped in that abandoned house. The book is definitely worth reading and itâ€™s way scarier than the movies."
"The 2000 Walkerton Ontario drinking water crisis. Drinking water became contaminated with E. Coli and Campylobacter jejuni.

Over 2000 seriously ill and 6 dead. All because Stan and Frank Koebel ""faked until they made it"" through the system. Had cushy admin city jobs and denied any issues with the drinking water until the OPP came crashing down on them. They pled guilty under bargain for falsifying reports and drinking on the job.

"The largest role her father ever had was a small role in Iron Man 2 and her mom's biggest role was Samara in the game Mass Effect 2, I really don't think that gives her that significant industry connections over a regular person. If you look at the writing credits on her album it's only her and her brother, most pop artists are written by committee so I really don't think her rise to fame is that insidious, also just don't think you understand how easy it is to blow up as a random artist with no connections in 2019, it has literally never been easier, you can record music in your home for practically nothing and if people think you have talent they will stan you and one hit turns into a career."
"The ""Thank you Stan"" Marvel Studios opening at the beginning of Captain Marvel."
