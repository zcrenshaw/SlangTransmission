Library doesn’t even have to be open with ebooks. Library ebooks are so amazing it’s like stealing. But totes legal. Def my favorite free activity. 
"Undiagnosed  mental illness made him think less of himself and also sabotage his relationships till I came along and was like NOPE. Now hes much better and we are very happy :)  . Honest truth if he was like 100% mentally fine I would have never had a chance. Im not bad looking but Im def not his level of genetics. Also I think he went  undetected so long specifically because of his looks , family and accomplishments.  Seriously when I brought up his abnormal behavior to his mother she was like ""oh hes just a big active guy! of course he gets angry. He has a 4.0 at a top level university there is no way hes suicidal! Look at that 2% body fat that cant be because of his insane depression thats now morphing into an eating disorder "". No MIL this is not normal and he was not okay.  Happy to report 5 years later of intense therapy and a good med regiment hes so much better. "
Oh my god this is so fucking bad. She def thought about it later on 
Nahhh def not cycling. Not really possible at our school. Fairly sure they were trying to bust him for hard drugs used over a break.
