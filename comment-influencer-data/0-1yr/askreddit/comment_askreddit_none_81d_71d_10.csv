"It's kind of disgraceful that people will go into a fucking cemetery let a lone one for veterans to play Pokemon Go. It's just my opinion because respect is really important to me but if you think otherwise that's fine, everyone has their own opinion."

I think it's disrespectful of pokemon go to have gyms and stops in cemeteries. I don't blame the players. but the developers of the game should cut that out in my opinion. maybe i just have a stick up my ass.
"'He'. Honestly, gender pronouns are totally pointless. Let's just use 'she' for everyone and never ever think about the issue again."

"I understand your feelings to some extent. But abusive people are sometimes in enourmous amount of crushing pain others just can't see. It doesn't justify abuse at all, but I think it shouldn't be handled with more cruelty."
"It's illegal to set fire to a structure, the only way to legally do it would be to contact both fire and police in writing, notify them of your intentions, and wait for written confirmation that it's allowed"

"The army of the dead won every single fight and frequently had the heroes on the run. The battle of ice and fire was the last stand for the living, because if the Night King advanced from there his army would grow too big for Cersei's army to defeat. I'd hardly say it was wasted."
"Even then. It was terrible what happened to Japanese Americans, but no comparison. They were not starved, worked to death or killed outright. 
Presently the US is dealing with an invasion. Our resources are stretched thin.  These people are very poor and are eating better than they would be otherwise. If you don‚Äôt want to be detained, don‚Äôt violate our sovereignty.

"This year I turned into a teen (I know old) and it was the day after school ended, I gave my crush my number just yesterday because well why not. So to many people out there this might sound like bs, but whatever. So I've been depressed for a while and you know the the story. And this birthday i just sat in my room. Just there. And i got happy birthdays from my family on my phone, and a little irl. But nothing grand. I just sat thinking. Or wanting. Just waiting to see if she'd text me. She never did. And still hasn't. When I gave her my number she gave me a knowing smile the last time I saw her. And at the end of the day I just sat in my room wanting to do something but never doing it. And that was my worst birthday experience ever"

Asshole just wants the corpse of you know who just to fucking walk again? When he can‚Äôt walk due to him being an asshole in the first place? And then what he does in part 8 showing he didn‚Äôt even learn his lesson in the first place? Fuck Johnny lol.

"Still though, a good cop is still bad, considering the best cop will still evict your aunt on the rainiest and coldest day of needed. Sure, you can say that it's also a systemic problem, but it's one that the police uphold."
"Any line you draw between ""hard"" and ""non hard"" drugs is completely arbitrary.

Drugs are far too complex to classify into a binary of good and bad.

&gt;Heroin? Yeah, big fat addiction, don't try going cold turkey on that.

You can cold turkey from opiates no problem. It's a harrowingly experience mentally but it's safe.

You will probably be surprised to know that alcohol withdrawal is far more lethal than heroin withdrawal. Would you classify alcohol as a hard drug?"
Lol.
"Jesus, dude. It was humor."

"Ahh, so YOU can call people names, but no one can say anything back, huh? 
Despite the fact you came out name calling *immediately*, now you're *entitled* to a nicer tone?

Again, just because you *want* it?

""I can say whatever the fuck I want, to whomever I want to fucking say it to.  But no one is allowed to use the same tone with me.  Because I say so.""

Fuck. You.

You spoiled, entitled *hypocrite*."

Works on most women. They don‚Äôt want you to know how saggy they really are. Saying nice tits proves you are and idiot and that she can manipulate you with push up bra. Every manager without technical knowledge wears push up bra for the same reason.

"border patrol or border protection? I've dealt plenty with patrol and they're typically pretty chill guys and gals, border protection are typically who you see at airports and are typically wannabe cops that are just a step above TSA."

"McDonald's is not convenient. It's not even the kind of convenient place where people can go to sit down and eat a sandwich.

The chain's location in Las Vegas is in a nondescript building on a quiet street. The restaurant's only employees are managers, workers whose regular pay is about $10 an hour. They come and go as they please, and are only paid on Friday and Saturday evenings at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. They work in the fast food restaurant's kitchen, which has only two seats.

McDonald's has many locations, but Las Vegas is the location that's made more convenient for customers visiting McDonald's than any other in Nevada. Its location, like many, is located right below Metro's Grand Circus Park and nearby at least one other McDonald's."

"Im glad that you think being open minded, tolerant, and standing up against racism is funny/trolling....smh.

Ok yea make shit up....at the very most upper range(which isn't ideal or healthy) a 5 ft 6 female should not weigh more than 143. Again I'm sorry for offending you, I know its very popular among white people to fatslpain and ""you can be healthy at any size"" and frankly I don't care what you weigh.

 I only took issue when you used the adjective small to describe yourself which is verified to be false(which the most cursory of Google searches and common sense shows to be not true). A 160lb woman is a big ol girl and in no world outside Somoan ethnicity would that be considered small. 

Sorry for ruffling your feathers, I have struffled with my weight, and the sooner you get out of denial the better off you'll be. I hope you have a happy and a healthy."

"That sounds like how my dad responds when I point out hot younger girls with some hips and thicc. He's like ""yeah but girls like that get fat after a few years of relationship."" I always rolled my eyes. Like. You like her don't you? You think she's hot? So why fuck that up with crystal ball nonsense."
Was highschool pretty boy and slept with 30 or so hot girls. Did not regret. 25 now.
I know republicans are so toxic right?......
"It's not a ""gift,"" but it's certainly something that they bring to the table, and assuming a hetero relationship, sex is more valuable to a man than to a women for a fairly large chunk of adult life, because it's so much harder for men to find someone willing to sleep with them.

I couldn't say if this is good, bad or neither. It simply is. And if you respect a man enough to want to get to know him and prevent a ONS, withholding sex for the first date at least may well be the way to go about it. Provided they don't get the cold shoulder most guys will deal with it for aforementioned reasons."

"I'm really concerned about the number of people in this thread who want to get rid of their uterus. Like, maybe just get rid of all of the various complicated machinery in there that causes periods?

"explain to me what you **do** stand for then, please. you deny standing for equality *and* you deny standing for discrimination of men.

so what is it now? the root of feminism lies in equality. while what we have come to know the word for nowadays, lies in the disadvantage of men.

we need EQUALITY for this all to work, not replacing the sex in power with the other. that is just as short sighted as replacing a dictator with another.

i know there are so many things they teach you about feminism and how diverse the strives are - but what it boils down to is always either a gain in respect, power etc without changing gender dynamics, or equality, or reducing men's rights.

if you are aiming for females to be the ones inviting guys to a date, opening the doors or making compliments, you are *most* welcome to do so. that would actually be nice for a change. and also a step towards equality."
Damn. What kind?
"I was seeing this guy for a short while and hadn't talked to him much when I was in the hospital due not feeling well. The day after my surgery I texted him"" I'm in recovery ""then my phone dies. He texted me back after I power up my phone"" I don't date drug addicts"". I go explaining what's going on with me and he tells me to leave him alone even after the selfie in the hospital gown. Idk if my absence pissed him off or what.  I swear I don't care what anybody says when it comes to dating hot girls have it the worse. Yes I'm modestly vain ;p"
"Damn, what kind?"
"Eh, you're both right and both wrong in a way. You can't really control what you find attractive most of the time and it's perfectly reasonable that someone might not be attracted to someone who is overweight, even if they'd been attracted to them before. That's not something that should ever be handled as tactlessly as telling someone they're as big as a house or calling them a cow.

At the same time it doesn't really matter if you'd feel the same way about your partner gaining weight because all that really means is that you may find different things attractive. You may find their wit or charm attractive, that doesn't necessarily change if they gain weight so the fact that physique isn't as important to doesn't really make either of you more or less ""shallow"".

Physical attraction is important in a relationship and it's not shallow to not find someone attractive because they're overweight, short, have glasses, or have other genetic features you're not attracted to (such as having a particular eye or hair color, or being a particular race). It is, however, tactless and childish to tell someone that in such a harsh and unsympathetic manner, even more so to call them names.

Handling the situation like that was petty, disrespectful, childish, and demonstrative of a lack of empathy and compassion. These are qualities which are red flags when dealing with strangers, but the inability to muster up their counterparts for someone you love, with whom you have a child no less, is far more concerning."
