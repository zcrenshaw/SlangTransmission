"Its def more of ""what i used to keep there"" for me as well, but it had to be said haha"
"OK DEF I was not this guy’s manager but when I was a second-year surgery resident a new intern came on July 1, per usual. His story was that he had already finished a pediatric residency, which meant that for him, residency time could be over and he could go work as a pediatrician if he wanted. However, apparently his father was some sort of famous pediatric surgeon and his plan was to now become a general surgeon, and ultimately to become a pediatric surgeon (after further future Fellowship training). He was put on call the very first night. The next day I was told that around midnigh, he went to the charge nurse asked “are you in charge around here?” And when she said yes he silently handed him her pager and walked out never to be seen again. I guessed he had enough of residency and certainly didn’t want to be an intern again. Epic"
"my friend just killed herself and it was one of the most fucked up things ive been through...  i mean she was never the center light of attention but she was def happy and i had no idea it was coming, which is why it was so much more fucked up.  i coudn;t keep it together at the funeral"
"Exactly where I’m at. Bf loves going down. I’d never had it done very well, so I just thought I wasn’t into it and told him so when we started dating. After a while he tried it again (because he loves it and thinks it’s really hot) and hooooly shit turns out when the person doing it is actually trying to make me feel good and not just artificially lubricate me for 20 seconds so they can stick it in faster, it’s actually pretty enjoyable. Def keeping this one lol."
