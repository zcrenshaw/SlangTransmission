"I fell in love with Sweden. But every time I go and visit, I’m still shocked at how many people just lay out and tan. On the sidewalk. Next to this Fika shop. Next to a museum. 

Literally, people lay out and tan ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE in this country. 

I’d be walking through Gamla Stan or Djurgården, then BAM out of nowhere, I nearly trip over a lady trying to tan. åh! jag är väldigt ledsen!"
"The book gag on American Dad! is definitely one of my favorites. 

It's when Stan is reading a book that is describing what he is doing at the moment. I made [gifs of some of them](http://imgur.com/a/azzdx) a while back."
"I love my husband very much, but our relationship isn't the same anymore. The dynamic is different in the bedroom, and it's just not my thing.  Over the years he's revealed more and more, of what he's into. Things he hid from me for years.  I've tried to accommodate, but at every step there is always more that he wants. 


Did you ever see that episode of American Dad where Stan goes crazy with fetishes and he keeps wanting more and more? Yeah, that episode hits me kind of hard. 

I'm just to the point that I am not sexually into him at all. I have no desire for him or his fetishes because, no matter what I do, or how long I do it, he still has to finish himself off. 
Then he says it will  be better next time, if we only do more and more extreme things. There's just no limit to his needs and wants. 


The things I liked and what got me in the bedroom, are just gone. Completely over shadowed by his fetishes and needs. I don't even bother anymore. It's just not going to happen and it leaves me frustrated."
"Oof careful, I can totally see your comment be screeshooted and posted on twitter with a caption ""They hate us because we stan the legend"", then the replies are gonna roast the fuck out of you for hAtInG their idol. Man those folks called Army fucking creep me to the point of disgust. (no hate towards BTS themselves, their music are fine)"
"My kids got into it. I saw them watching an episode,  I sat down to watch for a minute,  then bang, I was hooked. The characters,  the comedy, the sarcasm. It is a totally under-rated show . Grunkle Stan rocks."
