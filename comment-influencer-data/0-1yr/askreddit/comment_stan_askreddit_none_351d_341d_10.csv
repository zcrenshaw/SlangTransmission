"When I was in grade 10, first week of school waiting for a bus, new grade 9 kid comes up.  One of my friend's their recognized him from his old school, said the kids name was Stan.

Actually became good friends with Stan through highschool, and ended up in Model UN with him when I was in my last year of highschool, he a year behind.

Looking at the list of students going on the trip I don't see Stan's name there.  I ask Stan, as the head of the Model UN club for our school, why he wasn't going on the trip.

His response?

&gt; My name isn't Stan, it's John.

My point is, unless you correct her, it's on you."
