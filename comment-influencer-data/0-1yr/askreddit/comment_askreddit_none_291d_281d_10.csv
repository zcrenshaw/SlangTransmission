Because what else could have happened?
"Your personal trauma is preventing you from looking at this issue from an honest and holistic perspective. What happened to you is an inconceivable atrocity and you shouldn't be expected to just 'get over' what happened so you can read a reddit comment, but it is limiting you from confronting the core of the issue at hand. The entire concept of pedophila and child abuse shouldn't been seen through the lens of personal abuse. If a humanizing perspective of pedophila, like the other person presented, is something that can cause you distress or anger, it would be really beneficial to talk that out with a therapist or someone close to you. The dehumanization of pedophila doesn't help anyone or any child, and if anything it leads to more terrible things for society. You don't need to understand the motivation, thoughts, or the person of a cso or pedophile, but what you need to be able to do is stay clear of thoughts or perspectives that contribute negatively to the issue on hand, which includes dehumanization. best wishes my dude."

"Religions are like businesses.  When they're small everyone knows the owner and he directly controls everything and makes all the decisions.  He may have some bizarre behavior, but he can get away with it because nobody really pays attention to small businesses.  And there's usually people who will stay because they Really want the paycheck and being out on your own without steady pay (even if it's crap pay) is scary.  Besides, they're used to his ""quirks"" and when he's not being crazy he's really quite nice.

When they're big and have been around so long that the founder has died and they've been through a number of labor disputes....well, then they no longer have the luxury of controlling every individual or forcing bizarre whims on everyone.  Too much media attention.  Any one employee leaving is no big deal because there's always another person who needs a paycheck.  And even if the business overall is terrible and takes advantage of employees and makes the world a worse place...well, we like our coworkers and our immediate boss is decent.  Besides, would it really be better elsewhere? Probably every company is like this, right?  ....right?

Religion is what happens when a cult grows up and has outside investors."

"No one's saying any of that. The Press is a cess-pit, yes, and biased as hell, but no one's saying to shoot them. At the worst, some of them have had their White House press credentials removed as they weren't operating in good faith. No one on the right is saying, ""If you don't vote our side, you can't vote."" They want voter registration, and to prevent election fraud. It's the Left that's trying to undo the process of democracy, and to gut the bill of rights. If they could, they would gut the first amendment, and completely remove the second. "

"Nope. No, it isn't sci-fi. I'm not hardcore sci do guy here, but I've ready fair share of sci-fi. This ain't sci-fi. Sci-fi is fiction based on imagined future scientific advances, SPECIFICALLY to explore social, economic and environmental ideas. This movie is much more metaphorical, with pseudo-science thrown in. It's metaphors are fine, if a bit pretentious, but it makes the mistake of trying to be consistent physically as well as metaphorically, which doesn't work in this case.

Tldr; makes sense metaphorically/ideologically, very inconsistent physically/scientifically."
"Would've been so much easier if it was illegal, that's part of the issue. Impressionable people being incapable of making smart logical decisions, results in counterproductivity, complications, and health-issues for some citizens."

"My beliefs on guns are that military grade weapons, such as the AR-15 or the FN Scar-L, should not be available on the commercial market. I am not opposed to weapons like a pistol or a small firearm being available. However, the concept that I could go to someone's home and they would have a fricking machine gun in their basement scares me. Also, there have been so many mass shootings, like the one in Las Vegas or the Parkland shooting, that were committed with these military grade assault rifles. "

As soon as I dropped my pants, she did a double take that was right out of a cartoon.  Big confidence booster that!"
