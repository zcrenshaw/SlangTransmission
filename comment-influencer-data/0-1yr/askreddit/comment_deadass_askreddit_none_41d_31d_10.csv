"In high school, these guys had basically an archive nudes (I'm pretty certain the girls didn't even send them directly to the guys, they just circulated and the guys got possession of a ton of girls' nudes) and decided to purge them. The cops got involved for distribution and ownership of child pornography.

And then there was another instance where a student was having an affair with a teacher's wife, and the school's broadcast network did a little skit throwing shade at the circumstance causing the segment to be permanently banned. Side note, this same teacher ended up having mad issues. When I took his class his daughter was in it and all the times he was absent she would deadass just say ""yeah to be honest he was hungover this morning."""
