"So not me, but my dad. He grew up in Fort Worth, TX in the 60s and 70s. This would have been late 60s, early 70s.

He had this friend from school, Jack Davis, he refers to him as Jacky (when he does talk about him). My dad and Jacky were good friends but they didn't live in the same neighborhood so they didn't see each other all day, every day. They probably met up and rode horses together. Jacky and my dad would have playdates, but almost always at my grandfather's house, never Jacky's. 

One night Jacky's mom and stepdad, Priscilla and Cullen, threw a big party and invited my grandfather, I'm sure basically the whole town was invites. My dad says his grandfather came back and said, ""You are **never** to go back to that house. Do you understand me? Jacky can come here, but you can **never** go back over there."" My dad says my grandfather never explained what happened or what he saw, but his word was law so he obeyed.

In 1976, when Cullen and Priscilla were divorcing, ""somebody"" in a mask came into the Davis house, came downstairs, and shot Priscilla and her boyfriend Stan. When Priscilla's little girl heard the shots and came downstairs, she got shot too. Priscilla somehow lived and ran off the property to call police. Cullen was acquitted, and then later acquitted of hiring a hitman to kill Priscilla and the divorce judge even though the fucking FBI had mountains of evidence, because it was ""entrapment."" 

Jacky died a few years ago, he had become homeless and died of exposure. My dad cried when he saw it on the news. Cullen is old as balls and still very much alive, we sometimes see him at the grocery store."
"I’ve been doing the comic con circuit for a couple years now, taking my nieces and nephew to meet their favorite celebrities (and some of mine as well). I’ve been fighting cancer on and off for five years and found out I am now Stage IV so I wanted to do big, memorable things with them in case I don’t get to spend much of their adulthood with them. Plus if I’m stuck contemplating my mortality I might as well enjoy myself as much as I can.

Some of the highlights:

My oldest niece adores LOTR and we met Elijah Wood. He’s very nice and engaging. Kind of a hipster vibe and he was dressed alternately like an old timey train conductor and a mime. But she was over the moon after meeting him.

My nephew loves Supernatural so I took him to one of their cons. Everyone was great, but Jeffery Dean Morgan actually had me tearing up, he was so sweet. I had just been diagnosed and was about to start chemo when we met him. I was a little emotional and ended up mentioning it, and he just pulled me into the biggest hug and said he loved the shit out of me and I was going to kick ass. He wouldn’t even let me go at first, just kept hugging me and telling me everything was going to be okay. Makes me all misty just thinking about it.

And I’ve taken my middle niece to meet a lot of Marvel actors. Tom Holland is her dream guy and he’s honestly the cutest, most adorable person. Tom Hiddleston is really sweet and very British lol. Sebastian Stan is a very cool guy but can be kind of quiet. I think he was just tired though. Anthony Mackie, Elizabeth Olsen, and Paul Bettany were funny and nice. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Charlie Cox and David Tennant. Even Michael Fassbender was a total pleasure. 

My other personal favorite though had to be Chris Evans. We were talking and I thanked him for his work with Christopher’s Haven, etc. Before I left he ended up reaching out and giving me a kiss on the back of my hand. I may or may not have swooned a little."
"Stan Valchek is tied with De'Londa for me. He's a grade A shitstain (or as Frank Sobotka called him, an official asshole) that even the creator of the show didn't like. He pretty much caused all the shit that happened in season 2 simply because he wanted a whatever-the-fuck-they-are-called painting on a church window."
"Henry winkler (the Fonz and dr. Saperstein) is the nicest celebrity (of which I have only met a few of) that I have ever met. Nearly every year I go to philly comic-con with my dad, we had met other celebrities in previous years like Matt smith and Stan lee, during both of those occasions it was for a quick signature and that was it. Last year however, we were walking around and we see Henry winkler sitting at his booth with no line, we walk past it thinking it was because he wasn’t available yet but we come back and see him talking to some people, so we ask the person at his booth how much things were, my dad buys a photo with him for not that much and we wait in the small line to get the picture. When we go to stand next to him he is automatically very welcoming, and we quickly mention what we liked him in, but he is willing to have a conversation, so we talk to Henry winkler for at least three minutes before we run out of stuff to talk about; and then here’s the kicker, he thanks us. Usually for photo ops you thank the celebrity and get out, but he thanked us, and then shook our hands and said have a great day. Honestly to this day I think about how nice he was. Now you might think that he was just being as courteous as you would expect anyone to be in public, but both the fact that it is not expected of him to be nice and the warmth with which he greeted us is something I’ll never forget."
