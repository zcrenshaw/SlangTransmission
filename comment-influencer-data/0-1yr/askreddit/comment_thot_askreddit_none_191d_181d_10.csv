"so my entire friend group is a butch of nerd types that give absolutely zero fucks about getting into romantic relationships, except for one of our friends that would constantly go after girls that were obvious thot's or just bad in general and proceed to talk about them all the fucking time. Like I said none of us are really seeking a relationship except for him and we let him go on about the girls since 'hey who is it hurting', but for fuck sake he would always talk like he was trying to make us jealous when none of us cared. Note that he had a new girl every month or so that he would try to go after and it was just a huge cycle. The breaking point was when he had found this new girl that he proceeded to talk about for fucking hours while I was trying to concentrate on homework so I gave the most obvious ""I'm not listening but I'm responding to seem polite"" answers. He figured this out and got angry saying ""This is why you don't have a girlfriend because you're a rude listener and bad friend."" when he said this I finally snapped and told him to go fuck himself and that nobody cared about his newest $5 thot that probably didn't even exist in the first place and that nobody here wants a relationship because unlike him we actually have class and responsibility to worry about instead of pussy. Si denote: he was a C, D student while the rest of us were A, B students."
