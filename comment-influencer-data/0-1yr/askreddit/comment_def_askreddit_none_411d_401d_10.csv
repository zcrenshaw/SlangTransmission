"[Herm√®s ties](https://robbreportedit.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/146773.jpg?w=1000) 

They're a definite ""made it"" status symbol in the professional world (Finance, Consulting, etc.) - and it's a faux pas to wear if you're too junior, even if you can afford them. 

The designs are usually a bit on the [whimsical](https://www.styleforum.net/content/type/61/id/790843/) side, and colors can be a bit pastel-ish. But since the world where they're liked is very conservative, they're also one of the few clothing items where you can ""go wild"" without offending anyone. 

As someone wrote ""Hermes ties are like Air Jordans for white people"", but switch out white people with yuppies. 

Edit: Just to build on this - there are many ""made it"" items, which you can almost only wear after reaching a certain position (Associate and VP for example). 

- cuff-links (Juniors don't wear double-cuff shirts) 

- [Ferragamo](http://www.houstonsoriginal.com/images/m1_26/A2t49e6i.jpg) / [Gucci](https://cdn.lookastic.co.uk/black-leather-loafers/shaded-leather-bit-loafer-black-original-258368.jpg) / Tod's loafers 

- Hermes or Ferragamo ties 

- Rolex / IWC / etc. watches 

- Expensive suits (i.e $2k and up suits) 

Once you've hit a certain senior level, like MD, you can wear what the fuck you want to. But if you walk into a firm on your first day as an analyst, dressed like Gordon Gekko, you will most def. get an earful. It's a very hierarchical system. "
"Once you're past like ~1000 ft of falling, you're at terminal velocity anyway. Extra height adds no danger, unless you're so high up as to be in danger of suffocation or freezing (which you wouldn't be for long enough to matter in free fall from 33k).

EDIT: Want to play with fall profiles yourself? Try this Python code, which models a fall more or less accurately for a prone human (the constants here are set to match known terminal velocity near ground level and the scale factor for earth's atmosphere):

     &gt;&gt;&gt; import math
     &gt;&gt;&gt; def freefall(hnaught):
	     h = hnaught
	     v = 0
	     t = 0
	     while h &gt; 0:
		     a = -32 + ((.001033 * v * v) / math.exp(h / 27887))
		     v += a
		     h += v
		     t += 1
		     print(""At time "", t, "" altitude is "", h, "" feet at a speed of "", -v, "" feet per second"")

Then just punch in freefall(x), where x is your initial height in feet.

EDIT2: 3.3 feet to 1 m, so multiply by 3.3 for meters -&gt; feet and divide by 3.3 for feet -&gt; meters.

EDIT3 before bed: thanks for gold, but if you like science, your money's got a better place to go - your favorite Democratic congressional campaign. "
"I have a cringy ass story about a mall santa. I was a freshman in college at my local mall. This mall is basically dead hardly any foot traffic at all unless its the weekend and I see a mall santa. I accidentally make eye contact and he waves me over. I walk on over  to him smiling and hes doing the whole santa thing (I'm around 22 at this time) and I'm playing along for fun to not make it all awkward. His elves (girls around my age) start talking to me and you can tell them and Santa were bored af and just looking for someone to talk to. Well anyway they asked if I wanted to buy a picture with santa. I was poor as shit at the time and was def not paying the 20 bucks for a picture. I started to panic internally because I was like oh shit did they just talk to me for the last 5 min because they expected me to buy a picture? One of the elves says she bets my parents would love it and that's when the horrible idea clicked in my head. I looked her in the eye and said ""oh.. yeah sorry no my parents are dead."" (They aren't btw) Dead silence from santa and the elves ""...oh..."" One of the elves pipes in that she lost her dad a year ago so she knows and understands what it's like. They then talk to me for about 20 more min trying to make me feel better. I felt like shit the whole rest of the month and I'll still think about it sometimes and cringe hard.  


TLDR; I lied to Santa and his elves and told them my parents were dead"
"Lol they kept complaining how they had no headphones for when they went to the gym, so i bought them some awesome athletic earbuds that def wont come out of your ears when youre running or lifting or whatever. Then they had the nerve to say ""thats not i wanted, but i probably wont throw them away."" Fucking what? If you dont want them, give them back and ill use them for myself. No ""thank you for buying me something"" or even faking gratitude. Fuck you i already know its gonna be a problem being in a relationship with you. And then after the first day, they asked me if i was in love with them. No, fucko, i am not. Piss off. "
