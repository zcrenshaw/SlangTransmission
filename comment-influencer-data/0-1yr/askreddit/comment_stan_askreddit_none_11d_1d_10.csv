"Yeet is easily one of my most used words.  The middle two he listed I only ever use in jest.  Stan is something I use specifically talking about music.

Yeet."
"This bitch empty! **Yeet**!"" Mabel hollered as she tossed the burger wrapper out the window.

""**Yaaaas, Queen!**"" Grunkle **Stan** said as he stomped on the gas pedal"

"My mom went to Hawaii with her friend, and not me. Stan Lee died, and then 5 people telling me how dare I celebrate today. First birthday alone was awesome..."
"I want to tell you my story.

I had this girl best friend. Let’s call her Bettany.
Bettany is a K-pop stan.
She invented a fake relationship with a korean boy without a real reason, lying to me and another friend. I forgave her. She humiliated me and other two girls in my class in front of everybody else not showing herself the day we had to display a project. I forgave her.
At a party, during a truth or dare game, she made the boy I like and her other best friend, knowing that I had a crush on him,kiss, with me watching everything. I wanted revenge. I wanted her to fucking suffer. I kept on faking our friendship, when I actually wanted to stab her with a knife in her heart. In July, she sent me a text saying she wanted to end our friendship. Those days I desired death. 
But she actually helped me: All that pain made me a better person. 
I won’t forgive her. Ever again. That fucking bitch deserves sufference , but I won’t do anything. I believe that sufference I look forward to will arrive to her by itself."
