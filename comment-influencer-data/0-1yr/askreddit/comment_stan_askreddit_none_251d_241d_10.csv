"Like Stan on South Park said. ""Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why? "" "
Brokering the terms of a race down the K-13 between Thad and Stan Darsh
"I know exactly how you feel. I used to catch flak from many people for being an Em stan, but it was justified as I had my ears closed to everyone else. I got back into hip-hop to help resolve my depressed mind-state, and listened exclusively to Em for about 5 months. After that, I began to slowly branch out and started to listen to a lot of Eminem's favourite 90s artists and was transfixed by what I was hearing - it was fantastic and refreshing to hear something new. 

Similarly to you, I refused to listen to the new school but after hearing some of my favourite 90s artists talk about current artists they love I again opened my mind and ears and I am now in love with some current artists, who manage to talk about real issues in an inclusive manner in spite of the current state of 'mainstream' drug-glorifying hip-hop. If you want some suggestions for either 90s or current artists and some introspective songs to help you deal with any pain, just reply back asking :) .  "
