"Not me, but my mom. She was delivering uber eats last winter to some guy a little out of town. The location was a bit odd, but she went with it. Just outside our city on one of the side roads by some train tracks she parked her car and looked around for any houses. None. There was a train stopped nearby and suddenly my mom noticed a guy waddling through the deep snow towards her. ""Are you (random name, calling him Bob) Bob?"" He nodded, took the food, and waddled towards the train. Suddenly it starts up, and continues down the tracks. This guy deadass ordered uber eats while conducting a train!"
