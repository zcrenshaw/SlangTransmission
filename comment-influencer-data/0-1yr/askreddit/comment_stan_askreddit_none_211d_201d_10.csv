"I will stan the Daredevil show at every step, but even I’ll admit it’s full of flaws, and my gosh Karen’s one of the most obvious. Her entire plot is always a series of - DISCOVER MYSTERY -&gt; INVESTIGATE -&gt; GET ENDANGERED -&gt; GET SOMEONE ELSE KILLED. It’s like her plot armor deflects bullets into other people. "
