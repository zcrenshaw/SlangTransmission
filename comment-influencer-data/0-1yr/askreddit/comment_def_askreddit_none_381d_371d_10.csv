Thanksgiving in the early 2000s I headed out after family dinner to go see my girlfriend. Just before I step into my car, I think about how it’s balls cold and my 1990 Ford Taurus’s heat was broken. So I ran back into the house and asked my mom if I could take her newly leased, brand new luxury German sedan. She agreed, and I headed on my way. I had just about made it to my gf’s house, I was on a long straightaway on a country road, one lane each way with a double yellow line. I approached the left hand turn, and started to make it. Little did I know, a few cars behind me, teens were street racing. They were laughing and looking at each other trying to pass. One of them hit my driver side door doing about 60 mph. I don’t remember a lot directly after the impact. I remember I couldn’t move because my leg was stuck, I remember someone giving me a nextel phone. I remember a girl in the other car screaming hysterically. I remember police and ambulance being there very very quickly. And I remember the first policeman that got to me said, “I can’t believe you’re alive.” They had to jaws of life me out of the car, but that sedan saved my life. 100%. Side airbags, side curtain, engine cut. Car didnt flip, car didn’t bend at impact. The other car basically hit a brick wall, and flung it down the road a couple hundred feet. God damn quality German engineering. If I’m in that Taurus, I’m not typing this.

EDIT: a bunch of you make the point that the convo with my mom altered my timeline enough that maybe I would have missed the crash, but it’s not certain. The convo only lasted less than 10 seconds and I sat at a few red lights, which I think would have brought me back to the accident timeline in the end. We’ll never know, but i def consider myself lucky.

EDIT 2: here’s a shot of my driver door.

"Ok, I can't remember the place, or the band was playing. But was this at a Punk Show in Boynton Beach Florida in like 2000-2002? I remember a very similar incident that happened at like... I wanna say a Dead Kennedy's show, but it might have been something else, def a 80's/early 90's punk band though. And all the idiot skin heads showed up cause of a song like Nazi Punks Fuck Off... or a song a long those lines."
A Chillow is nice. But def just one that would stay at a constant cool. Stupid theromodynamics.
"In the 90s there was a big drive in the US to reduce smoking. It started town to town, then gained steam to nation-wide.

First it was ""not in bars"". Then it was ""not in restaurants"". Then it was 25 feet away. Then ""not in public spaces"". Airplanes got cleaned out -- remember when the last 10 [or whatever] rows were the airplane smoking section? Gimme that ol'e second-hand smoke, cross country.

Now, here we are with Smoker's Lung pictures in high def on each package of cigs and over in Europe it's puff puff puff on that lovely cigarette. Someone somewhere doesn't care or something."
