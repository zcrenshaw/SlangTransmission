Sounds like your place was too small for your golden.
"I don't have kids, but I definitely will force them to be traditionally Christian. Emphasis on freedumbs has led to 10 year old's dancing in ""drag queen"" contests for a bunch of pedophilic adults. The reservations of conservative Christians against the Americanist freemason ethos all came to pass. Bestiality legalized in secular countries, transgenderism encouraged even in children, and now netflix airing shows where children are sexualized. 

&amp;#x200B;

Freedom of religion is a spook, and it leads to horrors like the modern secular plutocratic west. "
"Out of my entire argument, this is what angers you?"

Are you the funny police? Can I see a badge? Dont gatekeep bro.
Even if they urinate on the Obama's bed?
"You keep switching between ""historical fact"" and ""immersive fiction"" whenever it suits you. But I guess that's the point of the Bible, it's an authoritative source you can use to justify literally any worldview you want without having to defend literally any of the baggage that comes with it. When God's agreeing with your politics it's a direct message from the most wise being in the universe. When the Bible doesn't back you up its just lord of the rings. "
Games on those consoles. Pretty obvious what I was talking about üòÇ
"The fact that this is even a question made me hate the US. My mother would slap me across the room if I would not holt the door for a lady. She would be in tears, because she raised not a gentleman, but a blithering idiot."
It's all bull
"Let me just quote from an other reddit used so your little mind with 30 IQ can understand my incoherent rambling on my third language:

""Are you suggesting that if you immigrate to Germany and declare a religious affiliation, they tax you for that?

If that's the case, holy crap you put together an incohesive thought.

Edit:. I looked it up because this guy is clear as a brick. Germany does in fact have a church tax where people with s declared affiliation to a church are taxed and those funds to back to the church.""

1. Aka I'm right.
2. This screws statistics and it appears there are less Christians. It's actually the opposite. But you know...I guess people just want to circlejerk."
‚ÄúJews aren‚Äôt people‚Äù
"To be fair, poor people correlate strongly with essentially all potential negative aspects of a neighborhood."
"Santa, they will grow up taking things for granted"
"I beg to differ. That person is not conscious at all that there are other neighbourhoods that are other people's neighbourhoods same as their neigbhourhood is theirs. The only thing in their mind is their own precious self and the only thing that matters to them is their personal self-interest. While it's necessary to take care of oneself first in order to be any good to anyone else, that's entirely different from not having any concept of other people's self-interest at all and thinking that oneself is the entire universe. ""Cares about their neighbourhood"" is a euphemism for symbiosis, where the person equates their neighbourhood with their self and therefore ""cares"" about it. There's no ""caring"" involved because caring can only be for OTHERS, not for your own symbiotes who are from that perspective you."

"stop watching that shit, it rots your brain"
Where's the gold?
well do you have another method that doesnt allow for people to change things like i mentioned above on a whim based on flimsy mental traits and super flimsy emotional traits?
Yes. I had faith that he would undo the damage done to our country by obummer. Him mocking a reporter made me do a complete 180 on my opinion.

Woah you're saying that because a liquid takes the shape of a container that there is no God? I think there's quite a bit more nuance to it than that.
No woman can be trusted. 
"&gt; If you get pregnant without wanting it first

Then wear a condom. It's not that complicated."
"Yeah I don't really like strawberries, the texture is weird "
Truth hurts huh?
"You are quoting a version that is NOT an accurate translation. The proper, and more accurate translation is the King James Version, and is as follows:

""Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;""-Ephesians 6:5

ALSO, before you go randomly cherry picking verses, perhaps you should read the ENTIRE chapter so that you #READ THAT VERSE IN CONTEXT.

The fact people are still religious in 2019 is a jokeüòÇ biggest evil on this earth is religion. 
I do believe the earth is about 6-8000 years old. And the thing with the Bible is that it says that can only take it all or leave it all. (Revelation chapter 22 has this.) we can explain a lot of stuff by science but some things like the flood aren‚Äôt observable and repeatable so we can‚Äôt use science to see the effects of those so we have to believe with faith
Haha.  Mature commentary
"I'm glad you found a way to avoid accountability for your religion's clearly unacceptable actions so cleverly. Good for you. By the modern world's standard, though, I think we should all be able to just accept that telling women to be quiet and let the men do the talking is not good, and it was a fuckup on the part of Christianity to push that idea."
"Although any teacher worth their salt wouldn't ""lol, no"" them but would rather explain how creationism and evolution are capable of living side by side, ""I believe all language was created at the same time, however over time through man's free will those languages developed into what we have today. After all we no longer light fire by rubbing two sticks together anymore do we?"""
He went through a bad divorce and made some truly bad (stupid) career choices.  Hubris I guess...

They aren't very creative. Just watch their God-awful movies. 
Take away guns first.  Even before due process if necessary.
"He literally just explained this. In the US, there is the federal (national) tax, then there is a state tax (varies by state), then there is the local county tax (again, varies by county).

If a large company, such as walmart, wanted to label each product with its ""final"" price.....they would need to calculate that for EACH store. Do you realize how much extra work that is? Instead, they simply mark the product with the ""base"" (non-tax) price since that price is (usually) the same across all stores. The specific tax rate for that area can then be calculated at the register."
"Nope.  You're allowed to disagree with me but there is no evidence to treat a TSH of 3.9.  There's even a lot of controversy about whether to treat subclinical hypothyroidism (high TSH, normal FT4).  I'll personally give it a shot but it's a crap shoot.  My wife is an endocrinologist and I'm an internist for what it's worth.  But you'd be shocked how often I have patients come in who are obviously mentally I'll and want their reverse T3 checked citing dumbass thyroid gurus.  Maybe we'll figure out we should be treating this stuff in the future but Im going to stick to current evidence based medicine for now."
"It had nothing to do with her, I wish it never happen the way it did, but it did. "
