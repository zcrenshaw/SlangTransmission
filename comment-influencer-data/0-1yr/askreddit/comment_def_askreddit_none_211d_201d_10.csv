"As much as I LOVED Umbrella Academy, it was definitely a huge culprit of this. It has so many loud action scenes with montages, followed up by muffled dialogue. 

I really wonder if it isn't the age old issue of ""edit on a crappy monitor first, then your high-def one"", only in audio form. A lot of studios have setups that make the final edit version seem phenomenal----but incorporate it into a non-surround-sound TV, it becomes jumbled."

"Yup I feel you.  That was me 2 weeks ago. Legit crawled from the bedroom to the living room to get the CBD Balm. Then proceeded to the class I am a TA in, the next day, and had to lay on the floor behind the podium thing- bc my back was “stuck.” Im 35. But still.  

Also, def old bc I began telling the students to take care of they shit now bc they will wake up one day and have major back issues from something random when they were younger. 
Btw-hope ur back gets better. CBD Topical is abt the only real relief I get. Worth its weight in gold"
