"Hey hun!

Look, I know we haven't talked since kindergarden but I'm sorry your duped into thinking that 9-5 grind for someone else is were its at, But I'm my OWN boss, I set my own hours! AND I get paid every 10 seconds, can you say that? #$$$ Why waiting two weeks for a liveable paycheck? You can join my team of #bossbabes but I only have 2 spots open so take this #opurtunity while you can! Yeah it's a lot up front cost, but #INVEST #IN #YOURWELF, your worth it! I support my family by selling ALL NATURAL, CRYSTAL BASED, ARSCENIC INFUSED face scream and even if you don't want to rock that #mompreneur lifestyle, you should def think about checking our our line of prodcuts, I scene your pics, you could def use them, and def buy from me, my garage is SUPER FULL of scientifically-unproven garbage and my fam and friends won't talk to me anymore!

^(this also gives me the #opurtunity to fix my subreddit linking fuck up, slash wrong way :O)"
"i would def not be sad if i had sex with ur wife 12 times

EDIT: Thanks for the gold!"
"Went on a OkCupid Date a few years ago. Super cool girl, we got along really well. She suggested we go back to my house to binge watch some netflix since we both liked the same shows. We are laying in my bed and things start to progress. After a few mins we are both in our birthday suits, and I already know what is eventually going to happen so I decide to go down on her since its something thats usually mutually enjoyed. As im down there having fun I look up and she is def into it but has decided to not only lock eyes with me, but every time I break my stare and look back again she flares her eyes as wide as they can go. She then repeats that every time we re connect visually...Everything else besides that was truly awesome, I just couldnt get over it.

Also she had old lady perfume on which was...odd."
"Prob would be a good defense. I’m just learning of this situation today, I’m in a completely different city so I couldn’t help. My personality I would def bait him into something like that"
