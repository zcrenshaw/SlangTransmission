"Honestly I don't get it. I'm a guy but shit at least I know a good looking guy when I see one. 

I mean, if you know who looks deadass ugly, like some generational incest mongoloid mf kind of ugly, then that also means you know what kind of guy looks handsome. You don't need to be goddamn gay to admit another dude looks good. 

When I walk with my gf I elbow her and point out hot looking guys, and we'll both oogle at the dude. She'll walk up to other girls and compliment them, maybe in a shoe store she'll go ""those shoes look great on you."" What am I going to say - *hey babe, I think you might be a lesbian*. Lmao are you serious? And if I see another well dressed guy and compliment him, I'm sure as hell going to get pissed off if she goes - *what are you, gay?*"
