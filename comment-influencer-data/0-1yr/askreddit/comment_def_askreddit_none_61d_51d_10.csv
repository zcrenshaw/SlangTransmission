"Someone recently told me that i ""have the power to move people. To make them feel special and as though they can move the world"".

Well... Damn. That came out of nowhere and def made me feel so freaking high."
"Def Jam Fight For New York, an old fighting game from the PS2 era. It's even got a new surge of popularity and a discord with online play through emulators."
"The issue I have with my boyfriend is that everytime I try to discuss an issue with him he automatically freaks out and says we're fighting. Things have to be going perfectly 100% of the time, otherwise we're fighting. There's no in between. We can't discuss problems rationally and calmly. Recently, I graduated from college and started working full-time. Before, I had more time to do 99% of the housework and did most of the cooking, but since I started working full time, I wanted him to do a little more of it, since we both now worked 40 hours a week. I broached this topic in an adult way (we are 30 and 33 years old, def. adults here), in a calm manner, not accusatory, just asking if perhaps we could make up a schedule of chores for each of us to do....and he automatically comes back with ""why are we always fighting???? It's always a fight with you!!!!"" I had not raised my voice or accused him of being lazy....it was extremely frustrating and I'm still scratching my head at how to try to figure this problem out. So I guess what I'm getting at is, some people consider things ""fights"" and some people consider things ""ration discussions about divisions of labor."" Oh well."
"Crazy to think the unintended consequences of changing that.  

Def influenced a psycho in the exbf mentioned here"
"Get all the armor from Niflheim, upgrade to max, try to switch up your runic game too. As for the other the pommels, talismans, and enchantments, all I did was try to focus on my Strength, Defense, Vitality, and Cool down. Upgrade everything you possibly can. 

When she goes to do that big huge slam that’s unavoidable, do your best to see it coming and to be as close as possible, cuz you need to hit her with the leviathan axe and follow up with a runic. When she glides towards you to slam your head to the ground, dodge to the side only, not forward or back. When she shoots to the air to curb stomp your head, always run, never dodge or roll. Block when she uses her scythe even if it stuns you. If she hits you the first time with it, block and you have a guaranteed party. Parry everything you can, but mostly run around. When in doubt, run around.

Light arrows only, shock don’t do sh*t to this b*tch. Most importantly if you feel like you’re going to get hit with ANYTHING, AT ALL, just run. Don’t risk it. And when, not if, but WHEN you die, use your beserker resurrection stone. NEVER throw rocks at her. You will miss, and waste your rage. I just spammed his light attack and it generally got Kratos back to good health.

Even with all this, it took me 5 hours. The emotional payoff is worth it though. 

If you care at all, I beat it with:

Leviathans wake (light)
Glaive Storm (heavy)
Blightbringer pommel

Rage of the titans (light)
Hyperion Grapple (heavy)
Grips of the Valkyrie pommel


Murder of crows (Atreus)

For armor:

Ivaldis armor all the f*ckin way

Ivaldis corrupted mind
Andvaris soul
Tyr’s shard
Heart of the Valkyrie
Perfect symbol of the realm (str 14)
Eye of the outer realm
Asgard’s shard of existence
Eye of Niflheim
Flawless element of the realm (def 12)

Talisman of the realms

Legendary runic Vestment (Atreus)

F*CK the “give me god of war” difficulty."
I have a predictions it will turn into a party honestly. A bunch of out of state ufo enthusiasts in the desert? I bet people will cosplay and sell merch. Journalists will def be there to interview people and take pictures and video.
