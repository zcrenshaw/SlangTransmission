"Yeah man. I was a jock, popular, straight A student, sold pot. I was better than everybody and acted like it. I treated people like shit because I knew I was better than them. Then one day a few years later after a fat bong toke I realized I wasn't better than everyone and I was a huge douchebag. People are just different. I'm really lucky I still have the friends that I do and even though we live on opposite coasts we talk every day and play an MMO game we played in middle school together a couple times a week. 

In hindsight as well, though, when I first moved to that town in 5th grade I got bullied alot. I had to beat up several kids to get some respect. I immediately gained friends by putting mean kids in their place. Then puberty hit me hard and I was shaving by mid 6th grade and I dominated in all my organized sports. "

"Banning the consumable part at least makes more sense than banning the part that can easily last 250 or more years.  It's the same with drugs since they're consumables.  I was in my forties before I saw my first drug, and that was only after a marijuana store opened up across the street from where I lived.  Laws against consumable drugs certain work, or at least, forced drug use underground."

These are things adults do.  This thread is for kids on reddit who have little to no sex and know next to nothing about it.

"&gt; Health - medicine and doctor visits

This doesn’t really capture it, though. Yes, money can buy you the best care that’s medically possible today. Human medicine is still incredibly rudimentary. No matter who you are, you will still age, and you will still die. If you get cancer, you will not automatically be cured just because you can see a good doctor. I think that’s what is meant by “money can’t buy you heath”. It can’t cure cancer and it can’t make you stop aging.

&gt; Friends/family ... transportation, phone   
      
The bar to be able to physically visit family or call/chat them on the phone and Internet is very, very low. I agree that living in literal poverty makes many things hard. However, I don’t think we’re primarily talking about literal poverty here. Beyond that, having lots of money often requires working a job that takes an incredible amount of time and effort, which can seriously harm familial and friend relationships.   
    
&gt; Lots of things that make me happy cost money

Why do women deserve rights?

weak argument

&gt; But if you mean inferior as weaker, then yes, you’re half right, normally men are stronger. However, women can of course get fit and strong as well, sometimes even stronger than men.

An average male is way stronger than a woman that exercises. Even heavy lifting. The only way a woman has even a chance is to juice or face a male with low testosterone."

Alright. Gloves are off.

There is a [shit-ton](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/race-and-iq/) of evidence suggesting a racial disparity in intelligence. Take the [Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study), for example.

The American South is more racist than the North, and has more experience with blacks. Americans are more racist than Europeans, and they have more experience with blacks. What does that suggest to you? Should we believe the people who have more or less experience with blacks?

Education doesn't increase intelligence by much. Either you are smart or you aren't. Most experts agree that intelligence is about [80% nature and 20% nurture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ)."
