"I dunno if this is really the most awkward, but it was def awkward. I visited my bio dad's old church in Mississippi a few years ago and spoke to his old preacher for a moment. One important detail for this story is that my dad died when I was seven, so a pretty good while back.

My grandma told the preacher who I was: ""This is Pomelo Sr.'s daughter, Pomelo!""   


Preacher: ""Ohh! Pomelo Sr! Tell him I said hi for me!""  


Me: ""Sure thing!""   


My grandma's face was priceless. We agreed the preacher would feel really awkward when he remembered later that my dad was dead."
"Honestly I'm not a big fan of astroglide. I'm about as close to a line expert as you can get (I'm am escort and porn performer) and the best lube I have ever found is called Fuck Water. It's local (to me, made in Canada), and their slogan is ""For when spit and courage aren't enough"". They're body safe (you'd be surprised how many lubes aren't) and they come with both a silicone and water based lube. 

Astroglide is silicone based, and I find it gets very sticky and heats up in a negative way with friction. You also shouldn't use a silicone lube with silicone sex toys as they can bond to the toy. Silicone based lubes are really only the best choice if you're fucking in the shower because it is harder to wash off. 

I really love their water based lube. Water based lubes do evaporate so you may need to reapply. I find that water based Fuck Water mixes well with my natural vaginal lubricant and saliva so you can keep rewetting it with spit (note that using spit as lube can cause issues with your vaginal pH or even vaginitus if you or your partners mouth is especially dirty).

It doesn't taste the best but it's not so gross that I have to wash it off first. I personally never ever use flavoured or warming sensation lubes.

Tied for my absolute favorite is Bad Dragon Dildos Cum Lube. It's just super fun. It's stringy and sticky and supposed to be kinda like the tentical cum you see in hentai.

Check out XXX content creator Cat Candescent (nsfw obvi) if you want to see this lube in action. She's super talented and her vids are super fun.

While I'm on my lube rant I should mention - DO NOT EVER use any sort of oil or oil based lube anywhere if you're going to be using a condom. Oil degrades the latex condom and causes it to break. That means don't even use it as a massage oil before you put the condom on, it doesn't take much.

In conclusion - water based Fuck Water for vaginal sex or use of sex toys, either water or silicone based Fuck Water for anal, it's up to you, and if you're making a giant lube slide I'd def go for the Bad Dragon Cum Lube."
"I updated my comment to reflect this. Was not aware of the broader, more moderate Pentecostal movement. Def did not intend to cast a bad light on people who aren't like this. My experience is solely in the UPCI"
"Not my most nostalgic but I'll def respect it. When my moms dad got cancer when I was 16 she bought the game for me to not run away when she flew to Texas to help him until he passed. I had a troubled childhood, I didn't run way. I played San andreas. She passed 3 weeks ago. I guess this game does mean a lot to me"
