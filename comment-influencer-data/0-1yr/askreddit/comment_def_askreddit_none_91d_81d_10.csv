"Periods themselves suck and are inconvenient.

The stigma surrounding being on your period sucks and is exhausting.

The ignorance surrounding what it’s like to be on your period and how they work sucks and can cause major issues in your work and school life.

The trivialization of your symptoms because you’re someone who has periods sucks and can cause major issues to your health.

And finally, the jokes people who don’t have periods make about people who do have periods suck and contribute to all of the problems listed above.

Ya, periods are def one of the worst aspects of having a vagina imo."
