Probably something negative about Stan Lee would do the trick
"Reminds me of the episode of American Dad when Stan cant act so he blows his cover. 

""Water?"" 
Lmao"
"The CIA never gives Stan lines because he always messes them up. 

""You're offering me water, but some how I'm not buying that you're really offering me water."""
"Stan.

Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'... "
"Dad made sure to establish dominance.

Sounds like an episode of American Dad. Stan is struggling with getting old and his masculinity as Steve is slowly becoming a man starting to beat him in things he never used to. Video games, puzzles, finishing dinner, basketball. The one thing Stan could hold over Steve is Stan was fuckin' Steve's mom and he wouldn't let Steve forget it."
One of them killed Stan Lee earlier this week.
Called out Stan Collymore (a black ex pro footballer) for calling people white trash that didn't agree with his opinion. He thought it's not racist if people are white. He is also known for being a woman beater. 
"He'd give them the plot synopsis, theyâ€™d illustrate it, and then he would go back and write all the actual dialogue. It was definitely a give and take process, but the idea that he ripped off everyone is just as overblown as the idea that he did it all by himself. 

It takes both great art and great writing to make a great comic. Without Ditko and Kirby, Stan would not have been as big, but the other way around is also true. And Stan's dialogue and punchy writing style helped defined Marvel comics in the early day. It's also not an overstatement to say that without Stan we wouldn't have the Marvel we have today. "
