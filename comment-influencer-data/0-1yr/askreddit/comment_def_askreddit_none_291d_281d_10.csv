"Neil Gaiman's Anansi Boys. Donald Glover as Fat Charlie, Micheal B Jordan as Spider.  I'd love for Lavarr Burton to play Anansi, as thats who I pictured when reading the book, but the role would also be great for someone with musical chops like Mos Def or Jamie Foxx.

It's an interesting story. Starts out pretty mundane but once Charlie discovers he is the son of a trickster god, and his brother he vaguely remembers shows up and takes over his life it becomes a supernatural adventure through dreamscapes."
Def a USA thing. No one in Europe cares about nudity and sex. 
no need for quotations. its def used. i done sniffed it! ðŸ‘ƒ 
"I recently wrote about this, so itâ€™s kind of fresh in my mind. When I was 11 or so, I wanted to join the school soccer team. I told my parents that I was going to be at practice until whenever it ended, so not to pick me up. I forgot the form and I didnâ€™t want to wait an hour doing nothing, so I asked one of my friends that lived near me if he wanted to walk home together (mind you, my house was about a half hour walk away from my school).

So we walked home, and went to my house. Nobody was home, and after waiting for 15 minutes or so, we decided to go to his house and that I would call my dad there. Now, my dad had recently changed his cell number, so I called the wrong one, no answer. Turns out he had gone to pick me up because he forgot about soccer. I called my brotherâ€™s cell, but he was still in school (high school) and didnâ€™t answer.

Iâ€™m not sure how things ended up getting out of hand, but apparently people saw me walking away from the school. Now, my friend who I walked with was a very unique looking kid, but people who saw me walking with him said they didnâ€™t know who I was waking with. My dad freaks out and the school calls the cops and everything. They claimed to have called everybody in my class, but my friendâ€™s house never got the call, and his mom (who was at work at the time) said they never called her either. Thatâ€™s really weird if you ask me, but whatever. From what I was told, there was a giant search for me all over my city. Itâ€™s been about an hour of my friend and I playing that Def Jam fighting game when my brother finally checks his phone and sees the missed call. He calls back, I talk to cops, they come get me, end of story. 

I suppose looking back I should have stayed at school and just watched practice, but I expected my dad to remember that he didnâ€™t need to pick me up right away. 

Also, it turns out my soccer form was just in my binder in my desk.

Tl;dr, forgot soccer form and walk home, dad went to pick me up and canâ€™t find me, cops called, large scale search, wasnâ€™t missing at all."
