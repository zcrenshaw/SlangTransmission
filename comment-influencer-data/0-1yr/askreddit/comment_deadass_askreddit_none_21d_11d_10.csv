"I once had a substitute teacher who smoked pot right before the day started. One of the kids deadass got a contact high and then the teacher was fired. The sub tried to say that the blunt was already there, but ironically she had a fleck of it on her face. Needless to say, she got fired and was banned from teaching forever."
