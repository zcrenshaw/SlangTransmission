I accidentally went through a door that should have been locked to like a back stage/VIP hallway so he didn’t even have his body guards or people around. I was frantically looking around corners when I hear “whatcha need lil man”. I was embarrassed but said I was looking for the bathroom. He said there was a general use one over that way and I probably should hurry because i wasn’t to be back there. He generally seemed like a nice guy that you can run into anywhere, it’s hard to believe what he had to do growing up."
