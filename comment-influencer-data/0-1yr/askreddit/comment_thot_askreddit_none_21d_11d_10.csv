"I really hate it when there's this little bitchy girl that thinks everyone likes her and she comes to me and acts like she's better than me. Happened once, she said ""What kind of name is Timothy"" and i just decided to keep my mouth shut but her name was way worse than that. I don't know if i should have stood up for myself, but i think i should've. She was a bitch and never talked to me ever again, better off that way anyways. She a thot btw."
