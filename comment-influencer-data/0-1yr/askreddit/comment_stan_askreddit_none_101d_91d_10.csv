"American Dad, Season 7 Episode 16 (The Kidney Stays in the Picture). It’s Stan telling his past self about the incident but it’s never really clear if his past self learns from it."
"I can see that but I personally think Dipper learned from his great uncles. His life is very parallel with what their life was in terms of sibling relationship and it was going down the same road where the smarter one was taking a road that would be pretty good for them but it would sperate them from the dumber, tougher more fun loving twin and in each one the dumber twin reacts poorly but with Stan and Ford it ruined their relationship while Dipper and Mabel got closer. Sure learning from Ford would be amazing but throughout the entire show we see how everything falls apart for them when they aren't together and when they work together they do amazing things, to me it seems like he's just doing what he's always done which is be there with and for his sister.

Granted though he does sacrifice what he wants for her a lot, like letting her be taller, giving up his perfect day with Wendy so she can have Waddles, giving up studying with Ford so she doesn't lose a brother."
"Stan Lee, that guy was a legend"

I also see Stan Lee, right in the middle, hand on chin."
"Also she's been through A LOT, like I don't know how you deal with the emotional pain of what she's been through and I'm sure it would kill some people.

Her concert in [Manchester was the target of a terrorist attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Arena_bombing):

**""Twenty-three people died, including the attacker, and 139 were wounded, more than half of them children. Several hundred more suffered psychological trauma.""**

Her concert was targeted specifically because a significant amount of her audience would be children.

Its not her fault that the attack happened and those people lost their lives/were injured BUT they were there because of her.

I don't know how you get through that, especially as bravely as she did.

Which was to come back to the city and organise a [benefit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Love_Manchester) and she wrote a letter on the incident:

**""I'm writing to you this February 22, 2018. It's been eight months since the attack at our show at the Manchester Arena. It's impossible to know where to start or to know what to say about this part. May 22, 2017, will leave me speechless and filled with questions for the rest of my life.**

**""Music is an escape. Music is the safest thing I've ever known. Music - pop music, stan culture - is something that brings people together, introduces them to some of their best friends, and makes them feel like they can be themselves. It is comfort. It is fun. It is expression. It is happiness. It is the last thing that would ever harm someone. It is safe.**

**""When something so opposite and so poisonous takes place in your world that is supposed to be everything but that... it is shocking and heartbreaking in a way that seems impossible to fully recover from.""**

**""The spirit of the people of Manchester, the families affected by this horrendous tragedy, and my fans around the world have permanently impacted all of us for the rest of our lives. Their love, strength, and unity showed me, my team, my dancers, band, and entire crew not to be defeated.**

**""To continue during the scariest and saddest of times. To not let hate win. But instead, love as loudly as possible, and to appreciate every moment. The people of Manchester were able to change an event that portrayed the worst of humanity into one that portrayed the most beautiful of humanity.**

**""Like a handprint on my heart, I think of Manchester constantly and will carry this with me every day for the rest of my life.""**"
