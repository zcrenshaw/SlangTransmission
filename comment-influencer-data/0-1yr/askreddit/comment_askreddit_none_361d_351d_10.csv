"Clinton didn’t “handily crush” Sanders in the primaries because she was more popular. She won the primaries because the DNC decided she was going to be the candidate regardless of the way the delegates voted. The truth is Wasserman-Schultz orchestrated shady shit like this all over the country: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/15/heres-what-happened-at-saturdays-dramatic-nevada-democratic-convention/?utm_term=.770d05b23c01

And also “handily” the mainstream media would barely ever mention his name. Not exactly surprising when you consider the monies interests that stood to lose out if he won, and that companies like Viacom were literally Clinton donors.

In terms of overall popularity multiple polls showed a general trend that went Sanders &gt; Trump &gt; Clinton because of the appetite for populism/distaste for establishment donor-led candidates.

Look, I know this is Bernie bro shit, but it’s also what fucking happened! Hillary and the DNC deserves the scorn for forcing through the only candidate who could’ve lost to Trump.

But I’ll still readily give the disclaimer: this is in-fighting we need to address but ultimately we ALL need to line up behind whoever stands to beat trump. It could be my dog and I’d vote for him if he had a (D) next to his name. the worst, most conservative establishment corporate democrat would be better than anything the GOP throws out there."

"They were behind on release... you are also comparing $2000 gpus to a $350 system.. a comparable gpu is more like the 1060, which is roughly 2ce as powerful.  And the point still stands, what more will it provide? Tbh graphics in general have peaked for screen gaming to the point where for decent returns will require massive boosts. Look at the Witcher 3.. would better graphics make much of a difference? 

The breaking point won't be power anyways, it will be when VR matures (where the power can properly be used) and thus the general gamer will be willing to pay for."

"It's very ambitious for the size of company but it has taken a long time u cant get away from it. Along with a few restarts as mentioned they have created there own engine just for this and future games (this takes forever to do). From what we have seen they put a lot of effort into this and catering for the community (the modding aspect especially). It's still going to be a similar style game but with a lot more features (the graphic update for one is huge) such as they have plans for permadeath for characters and transferring the player to different parts of the dynasty/family they must create. They unlike most games companies now days want there game to be perfect and playable on release and so even though people may complain now about its development time, as long as it has a good release, it will be a huge success I reckon ."
It feels like this ought to be a fun thread.

"My husband is the cutest man, always has been.

We were 16 (me) and 19 (him) and long distance at the time. He asked me out over the phone, even though we lived 400 miles away from each other. But we had known each other for about a year at that point.

We had been ""together"" for about 3 months over the phone/online and he was planning to come down to see me within the next two weeks. Well he got drunk at his sisters house that night, and gave me a call. We were chatting and having fun when he says in his drunken slur:

""I love you, but I don't think I'm supposed to tell you that yet."" Then, before i could say anything back, he promptly fell asleep.

Now, let me tell you. I had been pining over this guy for the last year, and not only was i flipping my shit when he asked me out, I was absolutely flabbergasted to hear that he loved me too. I hadn't said it yet, because for me it was love at first sight and I didn't want to freak him out.

So, because he had said it first, I decided to go for it. 

I sent him a text that said ""I love you too, I'm glad you told me, even though you didn't think you were supposed to."" For him to wake up to.

7am rolls around and he wakes up for work, and I get a text back that says ""Oh shit""

Then another ""Really?""

Then another ""I really do love you."" 

We're been together 10 years, and say ""I love you"" about 30 times a day. It never gets old."

"I see your points, though I disagree.

By leaving his (let’s be honest) extreme kink to be discovered in this way, he guaranteed an extreme reaction. If he was found sniffing his wife’s poops, the response would likely be outrage. Being involved without your knowledge and consent in someone’s extreme kink is disturbing. 

But he’s sniffing his infant son’s nappies. There can be no consent, ever. 

If you’re going to involve unwitting participants in your kink, they must not know. And now his wife knows, someone *is* harmed.

It is also easy to wonder whether this is a first step, which now taken allows him to justify sniffing or playing with the fresh poop. (Escalation, if you will). How would you ever trust him, counselling or not?

Tl:dr - husband set himself up for failure by not disclosing his extreme kink. Infant son cannot consent to be involved in poop kink. "

A conversation
"I am a graduated Biologist, worked in my dream job on plant genetics for 3 years.  I was the only one in my class to get a job in the field (genetics) several were trying 35 or more. I was super dedicated and a fierce job hunter, I still am. 

You don’t want to do Biology, the job is awesome I loved but it pays peanuts and it’s a lot of work for very little recognition also the market is so small and there are so few positions that there is no possibility to negotiate salary, you just hope not to get fired. The Academics part is even worst, all my friends in the academic world deeply regret it and some are the smartest people I know. 

Because of that I’ve switched to IT 10 years ago, got a second degree. I am happy in my job, I earn more money than I can spend by a lot. Couldn’t be happier with my decision. I still think my Biology job was the best I ever had, but looking at my colleagues from that time, I get reassured about my change. I’ve lived in 3 continents, I have a house,  zero debt, I am recognized at my job and my boss is terrified of me leaving, also I can switch jobs in a month if I want to probably with a raise. 

Choose a field you are very good at, that is my life advice. My job is not my life, it pays for it.  

If you are lucky like I am you might even have an awesome time doing it. I love programming it’s like getting payed to play video games all day and I work in the finance sector so it’s not the fun part of the IT field. "

"&gt;Because you have all the same college in common can talk about that for hours

Ehhhh I wouldn’t fully guarantee something like that. I went through basically the same thing like that guy, only I tried to be social and make friends... only to see it all crumble down by senior year. The friends that I “made” in college I don’t talk to anymore. I think there’s only one person from that school that I’ve contacted in the past 3 months. 

The point being... By the time my 4 years were up the only thing I could talk about for hours about the college was how overrated it was and how much it sucked. It is not as easy as it sounds to un-disillusion yourself from what you thought college would be, and what it actually turned out to be. "

"Love that term, reinvested. It feels good to have people say that I was more aggressive and could communicates less than I do now. People I know from high school and college years. Even how much I have grown since two years ago. Yet I am still me and can rant, rave, or just have a bitch fit sometimes. Because that is just me. But it does not effect my everyday life anymore. Knowing that I have pretty good control over that fire, and evil eye, makes me feel more powerful. And the more powerful and in control that I feel the more that I am. It is a process and maybe also accepting some flaws and points of view that are not socially acceptable. "
"I hope to hear from you after 4 years, hang in there."
"Seriously. I keep falling into these low low depths and I can pull myself out but its getting to the point of why...like I try so hard to improve on all areas of my life yet I still haven't ever felt like another person loves me like I love them. Sure I have friends and family, but have you ever sat and semi accepted the fact that you might be lonely forever? Its the worst feeling I've ever felt. Its a literal hole in your chest you feel that radiates to your fingertips whenever my mind wonders off and think ""Why? Why am I not good enough for ANYONE? What am I doing wrong?"" Then I cry a little and then pick myself back up and keep moving. Like a weekly thing now and its getting annoying, sometimes I just want life to come and grab me and take me away so I wouldn't have to kill myself, then the next I just want nothing but to live. Fuck sorry for the rambling I just needed to vent"

"It’s so hard to tell someone they aren’t alone when they feel so trapped in their own mind—in this cycle of pain and self hatred. 
I’ve been there. Sometimes I am there. It’s a horrible place. I’m so sorry that you know this pain. 
But, you aren’t alone. Don’t take it from me—get yourself to therapy, find help with a professional that can guide you through the darkness. Think about it like this: what’s the worst that could come of it? It might take a few tries to find the right person to help you. You are *absolutely* worth it. I don’t know you, but depression and anxiety don’t define you. They hold the best part of you down.

I've personally found that just speaking about it to a willing ear helped tons. I had all these unstructured feelings and thoughts that were rage inside of me, after reviewing how I was raised and what happened around me due to the negligence and intent of my parents, I realize that my behavior wasn't because of decisions I made.  
I'm still far from perfect, but I'm on the right path now. My girl is understanding and knows that when I wake up screaming at night and fighting demons that she can't see, she just holds me and puts me back to sleep... it's a little strange at first being the little spoon to a 4' 10"" woman as I'm 6' 1"", but it works and she takes care of me."
"I find I enjoy sitting back and listening to people ramble on and on incorrectly forever. I go through varying degrees of emotions, but I never correct them anymore, because apparently that makes me the asshole who thinks he knows everything.

"Not the same person but had similar issues.

My doctor actually prescribed clomiphene. Which is a woman's fertility drug that, in men, boosts testosterone levels. Not likely to be covered by insurance for men (in US at least) but costs something like $30.a month without insurance.

Has completely reversed my testosterone problem.

Worth investigating and talking to your doctor if you have similar issues.

Also, as an aside, sildanifel is now available for purchase with a prescription (viagra's generic and 100x cheaper). Low testosterone and ED often go hand-in-hand so thought it might be worth mentioning if anyone is dealing with that too. "

"If his/her mother is permanently disabled but still young(er), he/she may be stuck in a caregiver role for a long time if he/she doesn't get assistance to share the work. I was part of a caregivers' forum when I was taking care of my terminally ill parent, and I read multiple stories of adults in their 40s and 50s who had no career, no savings, and no partner after their dependent parent died.

It's unconscionable that in a civilized society there isn't subsidized caregiver assistance or at least pay caregivers a living wage. Because they're actually doing society a service too - if their dependent didn't have anyone, they would become a ward of the state"

"I've posted this before but there were multiple incidents at my school: 

A girl committed suicide and the administrators knew she was being bullied and did nothing about it. I didn't know her too well but she was friends with some of my friends and we ate lunch together sometimes. A bunch of the popular kids started making fun of her and it got to the point where they were basically trying to convince her to commit suicide and she got multiple text messages a day about how she was better off dead. She went to the principle and told him what was going on and even who was bullying her but all he said was, "" I'll investigate"" and never did anything. She eventually ended up jumping off a bridge. I remember after she died some of the same kids who bullied her acted glad and proud of what they did to her. 

There was a lot of problems with sexual assault and harassment at the school. I was one of the girls who was being sexually harrassed and when I told administrators what was going on they did nothing and instead gave me detention for violating the dress code even though I didn't violate it and had friends back me up. This happened to a bunch of other kids at the school and after a while we just stopped reporting what was going on because we felt like we were being silenced. There was also a few boys at the school who were known for sexually assaulting girls at parties. There was this one guy named Cole who would openly brag about it and someone eventually told the school what was going on but they did nothing. Eventually the principle and vice principle got fired and it was revealed that the school had multiple complaints and lawsuits relating to sexual harassment and assault. Unfortunately both the principle and vice principle went on to work for middle schools which have been having loads of problems similar to what happened at my school. 

The school had a bunch of security issues and problems with homeless people and junkies coming into the school and trying to steal stuff from kid's lockers. This one girl ended up getting raped by a homeless man in the girl's locker room. "

"Yes! Fuck that guy! I have a similar story.



I was driving and had just received a call from my bank informing me that somebody tried to use my debit card for a transaction across the country. I was approaching a hill that was blind on both sides; as in neither car can see if somebody is coming the other direction. I always move over close to the top, just in case somebody is coming from the other direction. This time just so happened to be one of those cases. This lady comes flying up the other side. I've already moved over and slowed down to allow her to pass. As she comes up the hill, she slows her car to a slow roll. She looks at me, with a cigarette in her hand, and says ""Maybe you should get off your fucking phone!"" like I did something wrong. I moved over for her and everything, even though I didn't have to since I made it to the top of the hill first. Her fucking smirk sent me over the edge.



Fuck her. I had a cherry Coke sitting in my car that's been there all night, in a medium gas station cup. These cups were made from a paper material. It also had cherry lime-aid flavoring squirted in, as well as about 5 or so actual cherries (I worked at the gas station and love cherries. I made this drink a lot). Both of our windows were down. before I even knew what I was doing, I yelled ""Fuck you"" and launched it into her car. Her car had white interior that looked quite new. Her face when that cup exploded was priceless."

"For me, it's the McChicken. The best fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.

One time I asked for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, ""Wow, three for free!"" and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, ""I'm going to call you 3-for-free!"".

Now the staff greets me with ""hey it's 3-for-free!"" and ALWAYS give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.

I even dip my fries in McChicken sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant."

"We had been work friends for about a year, year and a half and eventually we decided to go out on a date. (That's another story in itself!) She was moving back home (1,800 miles away) for school for 2 years in a month, but we figured why not at least enjoy each other's company until then and would see where we both were at when she got back. 

Needless to say, after we actually spent time with one another outside of work, I knew she was the woman I was going to spend the rest of my life with. (Which she says sounds like fake news.) We always used to joke with one another by saying ""You're stupid and I hate you."" We would always make each other crack up, and that was always our response. Endearing, I know! Anyway, fast forward a week into actually dating, and I knew I loved her and wanted to tell her. I wasn't sure what she'd say back, but dammit I needed to say it before she left. 

One night after we had gone out, we were laying in bed aaaaaaalmost saying it to one another. Lots of ""Hey, I really llllllllike you."" and ""I am so in looooo--like with you!"" Eventually I went to the bathroom to psyche myself up to say it, and finally got the courage. I walked back into her room, climbed on top of her and said ""You're stupid and I love you."" The thing was, you see, that she thought I was being a jerk again and started talking over me halfway through saying it. I saw the lightbulb click in her head what I had said, and she then proceeded to roll around on the bed giggling for a solid minute. She did say it right back to me afterwards, much to my relief, and we've been happily dating long-distance ever since. She graduates a year from this December, and I can't wait to make her my wife. Never been more sure of anything in my life."

Bobby is a dick but in the funniest way. He does like a 2 minute intro every podcast and if his guest talks during it he gets mad and will redo the intro from the start . It cracks me up.

Also Chris D'Elia has a great podcast. He does his solo though, no guests. Also his isn't just a podcast, it's a cult. We're gonna build a log cabin in the woods and live a hedonistic lifestyle.

Theo von is another great one. The dude has a way of looking at things like nobody else I've met. He's a southern guy who grew up in a poor part of Louisiana (I think it's Louisana) so he has a different perspective and background than pretty much every other comedian I follow.

So, I got him a nice watch. It had a note on it that said.. ""It's Dangerous to Go alone"". Then he would open the box showing the watch, with a note that said ""Take Me. And if you have the time, would you marry me?""  I also drew the old man from Zelda who offers Link the sword (and the room with the flames.. etc. et.c)

Anyways, I handed it to him in our living room.. and IMMEDIATELY panicked. I tried to take it back, but he had one hand on the box too. Later, he told me that he immediately knew what I was doing because I had lost all color and had a look of pure panic and fear. 

So, he got the box away from me- opened it, Stood up and gave me a hug, and went into the bedroom. He then came out with an engagement ring.  It had been in safe in our room for 8 months! He said he just couldn't figure out how to ask me. It was the happiest moment in my life. And he was so excited I asked. He loves that we did it our way.

Student was expelled the rest of the year but came back the next year and the bus driver was pretty much blacklisted for a lot of other things that cropped up from this incident."

"Immediately file for sole custody of my children and have my ex committed.

My ex is a borderline sociopath.  I know, everyone says this about their ex but this one is Pacific Heights level insane.  My ex has been brainwashing my kids since they were 4 and 6 and done everything legal and illegal to keep them away from me.  They are terrified around her and act as if they don't know me *when she's around*.  My ex has gamed the system for years and since she has residential custody, joint custody means nothing.  I'm powerless.  I see my kids 3 days a month when I'm lucky.  My ex fucks with my weekends, dinner dates, holidays, birthdays and vacations.  CPS, family court and the police won't help and the DA won't file charges against her for the countless violations of the divorce order and my restraining orders against her.

Money would make all the difference in the world.  The divorce bankrupted me but with 1M  I could afford a lawyer, forensic psychiatrists and the custody suit.  "

"My fiancée, who id been dating for about 4 years, broke up with me last year in August. I’m honestly still not doing great, but even still I feel a million times better than I did the first few months after. My best advice would be to talk to a counselor/therapist about it. Someone that you can tell everything to and have the comfort in knowing you could literally just walk away from and never have to see again. It’s oddly comforting to confide in someone like that. It also just helps to tell someone everything on your mind without worrying about judgement. Aside from that, just remember that life goes on. You’re still breathing, you’re still actively shaping your life. Just because things are different doesn’t mean you can’t still do whatever you want to do. Stick close to your friends and make your life what you want it to be. I know the kind of hurt you’re feeling, and I hate to say that it may be a long time before you can say you’re truly “ok” (I still can’t), but I can say with certainty that you will be ok. We both will be. Best of luck to you"

"Try temporary recruitment agencies, they're a good stop gap measure to get you more experience to put on your CV and mean you're at least earning some money until you find something more permanent and some temp positions can actually lead to the company giving you a contract if you do a good job and a permanent position opens up; Also it can really help make you feel like you're getting out there a lot more and trying new things when they offer you a variety of work, I've done all sorts from driving half way up the country to help put up specialist shelving units, delivering and installing hospital equipment, delivering and picking up construction fencing, breaking down and restoring old office furniture, delivering beer to pubs and restaurants, printing wristbands for festivals, picking and boxing up perfumes and cosmetics and at the moment I'm making and packaging picture frames and mirrors. I felt so hopeless when I lost my long term job but one day I walked past a recruitment agency and thought what's the harm it could do? And walked in and then next week they had me a shift and id ring them up every day and say what have you got for me today, even if they had nothing constantly hassling meant I was always at the forefront of their selections when they did have work and id always make efforts to go above and beyond wherever I worked to the point I'd often have multiple places ask for me by name when they needed an extra man in. Keep your chin up and just take anything that pays and comes your way, remember if you really don't like it then it's only temporary work and you can ask for something else the next day."

"It's almost like abuse messes with your mind or something. The kind of people who could use this advice aren't the kind of people who have the ability to flag down an officer and say ""I'm being trafficked.""

These things happen because human traffickers are really good at making people feel powerless, because when you feel like you can't actively do anything, that the only things that can happen to you are either chance or because someone wanted it to, you're not going to be proactive in your own rescue.

This advice exists because 'shoving spoons up your pants' is a decision that you have a lot of time to psyche yourself into. You can work up the courage to do it for as long as you have the time to, metal detectors are known to be a little bit faster than that.

In conclusion, I hate the kind of person you've come off as. You seem like someone who hears ""put yourself in their shoes"", yet disregards the entire point of it. You think that because someone acts in a way you don't see yourself acting, that it's ridiculous or illogical.

"We had a serial pooper in high school. All four years. It started my freshmen year, in the boys bathroom when one of the teachers discovered that there was feces literally EVERYWHERE all over the walls, all over the floors, the mirrors and doors. Clearly it was smeared with fingers because of the hand prints everywhere. (I’m a girl so I never actually saw it) 

No one could figure out who it was even though a few people pointed fingers here and there. One poor kid was accused over and over again (I really don’t think he did it, he was just weird) and was so traumatized he had to leave school but it still continued. Finally,  the teachers got fed up and would have to monitor who went in and out of both the girl’s and the boy’s bathroom. It stopped while they were monitoring it for a few months and everything went back to normal for a while. Then BAM, it happened again. No one could even imagine who would do something like that. Each student was given three bathroom passes per year which could only be used once. 

To this day no one knows who it was. The fact that there was a 17 year old boy (or maybe girl) possibly walking around smearing crap all over the walls seems absolutely crazy. 

Still bothers me that we only had 3 bathroom passes per year. Quite a few girls got quite a UTI’s due to not being able to pee or change tampons. Smh

And this was on the Hungarian plain, well-suited for cavalry; if they attempted to push into the German forests or Italian mountains, they would have come up against similar fortifications in territory that put them at a significant disadvantage. Most cities surrendered to the Mongols because of the terror they spread; when the Mongols were resisted strongly by a fortress, as at Gurganj in Persia in 1220, they faced the exact same difficulties as any other army. Western Europe at the time was studded with armed fortresses that the Mongols would have had to reduce. It is unlikely that they could have maintained their advance under such unfavorable conditions."
"My old roommate and I were sitting on our balcony smoking a cigarette one night a few months ago. He went inside and I was finishing mine when I saw this bright orange light appear in the sky above the trees. I’m an avid star gazer and I know it’s not a planet, or a star, or a even a satellite or airplane. It just sat there, this bright, non-blinking light taunting me. I whispered my roommates name, wondering if I was just drunk and seeing things. I couldn’t say his name loudly enough to get his attention, so I knocked on the door and he came out. I pointed at it and whispered, “do you see that?” He freaked out and sat back down and we just stared at it wondering what it could be. Then it doubled in size and grew even brighter. I ran inside to grab my phone, and the second I came back out and pointed my camera at it, it disappeared. The sky went completely dark.

We lived near an air force base so I chalked it up to experiments, but to this day neither of us can fully explain it."

"It sucks but that's the basics of bankruptcy law. When a company declares bankruptcy, after employees are paid, the debt holders/lenders will get paid out. If there's anything left over, the shareholders will get a piece back of their investment. If there's anything left, more junior obligations are fulfilled - back rent to landlords, payments to vendors and utility companies... If there's any $ left after that, maybe the customer gets taken care of. A judge, lawyers and a bunch of consultants figure the exact details.

Same shit happened when folks were owed orders from Circuit City after they went under. You're shit out of luck. If you want to change that you'll probably have to rewrite bankruptcy law in every country."

"Having listened for a long time, I think he manages to allow guests to come on and open up enough so that their true meaning comes about. It's easy to make snap judgements about people from sound bites or 5 minute interviews. If someone opens up for 2 or 3 hours it is less so. I feel like he encourages his guests to talk about whatever it is they are passionate about (or whatever they have been doing) and tries to get to the heart of it. 

I am as far the opposite way as some of the ""alt-right"" and Breitbart speakers... and it is really easy to vilify people from their sound bites. When Ben Shapiro came on I was ready to skip it and say fuck him. After listening I understood where he was coming from. It wasn't necessarily a terrible place, but a difference of opinion on some topics and he's hardened from people attacking home as much as he's attacked people. 

I don't have to agree and I don't think Rogan did either. I just think he encouraged a guest to say their piece. "

"I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. Yes, it would be stealing for you to just take it back. That is true. And likely since you work in payroll, your role in the process is non-existent after an overpayment happens. It becomes a procedure between the employee and the employer. But without a doubt, it is legally mandated that the employee pay it back. If you guys are choosing to just eat that then I dunno what to tell you, that seems pretty dumb -- the reasonable approach would be to reach out and arrange something with the employee. You certainly have every right to recoup it. I'm sure if the amount were large enough it would be worth it. My guess is the lawyer is just saying ""don't just take it back"", which is legit"

"The game is tile-based, you can have that display be ASCII or be incredibly detailed tiles, the game plays the same either way. Changing the graphics is only changing what is shown to you, the player; you're not changing how the game works.

That being said, it's kinda necessary for a game like DF. If you're up to speed on the new graphics capabilities being touted with RTX, you've got a grasp of the opposite side of the issue - we can have nice graphics nowadays in games, because we know how to cheat at showing those nice graphics. You can't have something like a nice character model that then gets crumpled by a car, showing deformed flesh and interior skeleton damage, possibly both with a compound fracture, unless you were displaying all of that hidden inside the model already. DF simulates *everything.* You can aim your attack at individual fingers or eyes, you can damage individual organs which will then potentially fail and cause disease, you can apply physics to objects and have appropriate results (read: Minecart shotgun machine, you fill minecarts with pointy things like saw blades and swords, then accelerate the minecart towards a target, then stop the minecart). This is all stuff that simply wouldn't work with current traditional graphical rendering concepts, especially considering the space constraints and tile-based interactions going on. But, with a different technology like raytracing, graphics would be relatively easy, as individual graphical information would be part of each and every existing thing that's already being simulated. The game world would know how to display a cat to you, because a cat is a described size, described color, quadrupedal carnivore, has fur, has an expressionistic tail, has moods and whiskers and cleans itself and and and...All data about the entity itself. But if we have to translate that simulation data into graphical shortcuts...it simply isn't worth the time to try and implement that."

"orignally from /u/drbigblack 

The show starts in the animation style it was in the 90's. Bart goes down to find that Santa's little Helper is sick. The family takes him the vet and they found out he has cancer and needs to be put down soon.

Bart refuses to listen so he takes Santa's Little Helper and runs away with him. The family tries to find him and along the way they come across some of the iconic characters in the earlier seasons. Marge eventually finds Bart in an alley with SLH and tries to teach him a lesson of letting things go.

SLH goes back to the vet where he's put under the needle. They thank him for the memories they gave him. And through SLH's dying eyes we see the last scene of the Simpson family standing over him.

I couldn't even watch my mom play the first Resident Evil game. Then one day I decided that I was done being afraid of scary movies, especially when my whole family was into them. So I went to the movies and blindly picked a horror movie. And what do I pick? You guessed it, The Exorcist. I remember reading the back of the VHS sleeve, seeing it was about a girl being possessed and I was like ""Oh it can't be THAT scary."" So I took it up to my room and popped it into the VHS I had hooked up to my little TV...and watched it. And what happened? Why, I became the horror movie fanatic I am today.

"I would argue no other person at that time had more of an impact on the course of the war than Garbo (his codename). Hitler so trusted his Intel that he refused to believe the invasion was happening when it did. Obviously it's not only Garbos work that contributed to that outcome. But Hitler was convinced he had an entire army of spies that were in fact a single man.

The best part. The Nazis were bankrolling the whole operation. He would tell them he hired 3 new operatives and they would wire him the money to pay them. All of it was funneled back into the war effort.

The Nazis were skilled at many things when it came to war. They were skilled in tactics and had some of the best weapons and machines of war of any nation. But they had arguably the worst intelligence operation of any nation at that time. By the time the war was well underway every single German spy was working as a double agent for the British. "

"This encounter was perfect karma, if you ask me.

So I'm with my family, going to the mall. We're driving through the mall parking lot and it's insanely busy as usual. As we're about to turn a corner a guy steps out and crosses the road in front of our car, no big deal. We notice though that a wad of cash is just about to fall out of his back pocket, so we pull up so we're driving alongside him in the opposite lane and my dad rolls down his window and shouts to the guy that his money is going to fall out of his pocket, and as my dad is warning him all this cash dumps onto the ground - there had to have been at least $50 there - and so my dad shouts again at the guy, pointing at the man's money behind him on the sidewalk. 

*Well* this *fella* looked at my dad, and immediately just started flipping us off, shouting at us, swearing at us, being such an asshole. Literally if he had turned his head just a little bit he would have seen his money all over the ground and realized his mistake, but he didn't. He just kept swearing at us and flipping us off. It was kind of painful to watch, and even funnier the entire mall parking lot witnessed this guy being a dick too. 

So, he walked off, his money still blowing around back on the side walk. It was a long walk way so if anyone came across the money they wouldn't have connected it to him. 

It was absolute perfect karma though. Later on, when he walked into some place to buy something, he would have reached for his money, realized it wasn't there, and thought 'huh, maybe that guy in the parking lot was trying to tell me something'.

"Can we just talk about Lex Luthor kidnapping Ma Kent just completely throws off that entire movie. It's not good before then but plotwise, they're doing pretty well. Batman doesn't like Superman because Superman caused DC-verse 9/11 and Superman doesn't like Batman because he's a crazed vigilante who's brutalizing people and causing their deaths. Cool, that works. Having Lex pull the strings behind the scenes to make them fights makes it work even better. Then Lex kidnaps Superman's mom and tells him he has to kill Batman and admits that he's the supervillain in a big, long monologue. There's so many things that are wrong about that movie but Lex kidnapping Superman's mom was bad from beginning to end. The Martha scene is ridiculous but the ""I've got your mom. Kill Batman."" is just infuriating."

I had that same thought of, ""Well, fuck, if I do it now, I'll totally ruin their wedding,"" and decided to shift my d-day 'til after. That way, I could see all of my family and tell them I loved them all one last time and that I was sorry and then go on my merry way. I don't know if they could tell how badly I had been struggling or if it was sheer coincidence, but everyone was so kind and reassuring at the wedding, it snapped me out of my plans.

It’s pretty obvious in the movie and book but the Magisterium in Lyra’s would is kind of equivalent to the Catholic Church.

"*Nobody* can afford life-saving medical attention. It's absurdly expensive, but also very low chance, which is why you have to use risk pooling strategies to manage it - each person represents $X of medical risk a year, which is pretty regula. Whether you use insurance or government to do so is the debate.

Most of us have insurance. Most of us can get healthcare (though the ACA actually made things worse in some respects, insurance is more expensive and covers less, but the subsidies and not banning people for preexisting conditions have helped many people). Don't make the US out to be the hellscape it's not.

---

And I say this as someone who supports socialized healthcare. Government is painfully inefficient, but insurance is just as bad. At least the government has incentive to make the system work, insurance just wants money. But the US healthcare system is *just* bad, it's not a blighted hellscape. Yet."

Force-pulling herself back to the ship was probably an act of pure adrenaline-fueled instinct and desperation and it most likely took everything she had left to accomplish.

"&gt;I understand why he thought what he did but everythig about it was wrong.

Yes? That's why he's a villain. The issue is his core ideology is right. That what makes it so interesting. everyone agrees with his motivation, but the actions he took were clearly twisted.

&gt;they still risk their lives on a daily basis to save a bunch of strangers.

This is inaccurate. The show has a lot of combat and such as an action show, but most heroes are not at risk. Most of the time they deal with petty crime and optics. There are even multiple pro heroes introduced who literally do nothing but PR, they don't even help anyone.

&gt;Half the people stain targeted didn't even fit his description of bad heroes.

How can you make that judgement? We literally know none of them. We only hear about them second hand from unreliable narrators. Take Ingenium for example. We only know about him through Iida, who idolises him. We also see that Iida throws away his heroic ideals and attacks Stain out of revenge. It's not hard to imagine Ingenium doing the same (it's even mentioned that some of the victims are from Ingenium's company).

&gt;It makes you think what the hell was he basing it after in the first place?

Stain's selection suffers from perfection bias. Todoroki and Midoriya are safe because they don't display any faults that are not heroic. Iida does, which is why he becomes a target. Your analysis that 'anyone that wasn't allmight was a bad hero' is correct. Again, Stain is not correct in his targets nor his actions. That's why he's a villain. They show you his history in Vigilantes and how he comes to that specific point and it's a very understandable decline. He did not start out with those standards, but developed them after years of being betrayed by the Hero establishment, seeing those faults leads to countless unnecessary deaths, while those with those faults were glorified."

"I dont remember the movie much, but according the the documentary and all of Whitey's public statements (from what I remember), it was all bullshit information.

There were pages that were pretty much copied and pasted from other CI reports and a lot of the information was stuff like, ""there's a dead guy in ""someones"" trunk"" with no name or with missing information that would be pertinent. 


What I think is even 'fishier' is that there was a witness from the 70's (I think) that was threatened and extorted by Whitey during his reign and he was ridiculed and more or less laughed out of court by the defense. Afterward he was then found dead just a few weeks later from arsenic poisoning. And of course when it was investigated it was determined to be a ""disgruntled coworker"". And this was in the 2000's during his trial, not 40 years ago.

I dont think any of that made it into the movie."

"It's mostly in my thumbs and the meat surrounding my thumbs.

Think of big ass needle that sometimes has to go through your wrist, or the palm of your hand, or the joint in your finger, or some other places they will try it's always a new one apparently, to find a ligament that may be super deep in there and fill it with a crapton of liquid which you absolutely will feel fill up like a balloon but instead of an animal or something being made it's just your thumb ligament while the sharpest piercing stomach vomiting pain shoots through your body. It sucks a lot. The period of time that it takes for my hands to go back to being super shitty has been getting smaller and smaller though so the injections probably won't work for much longer.

"My 2 cents:



Just go to a vape shop and tell them you want to quit smoking. Start with a simple pen shaped one. Don't get tobacco flavoured liquid, they're nasty and will not replace the flavour of real cigarettes. I like simple things like strawberry or watermelon, those kind of flavours. Ask the guy in the shop how much mg nicotine he recommends for your smoking habits and then you can slowly go down (you will then start to notice that nicotine in itself tastes nasty too).



The biggest thing for me was that it feels differently from smoking in the beginning. You will cough. It's kind off like learning how to smoke cigarettes, it's not fun in the beginning but after 1-2 weeks it'll be nice. I recommend still smoking cigarettes (albeit less) during those first 2 weeks and then when a package is empty just don't buy a new one and stick to vaping.



If you drink alcohol, it will not taste as good a drinking with a cigarette but you will adapt to this too.



Good luck man! You will feel a big difference fast when you quit cigarettes for a while. Breathing will be better, especially climbing stairs and those things. Vaping is definitely a lot healthier! It also should be a lot cheaper than cigarettes. "

Thank her for releasing you to a future free of her cheating and lies. There was no way forward, no marriage or children with someone so damaged. What she did was incredibly dangerous, self destructive, and living a double life is a sign of a deeply troubled psyche. She needs years of therapy and it’s way above your ability to help her. 

Thank her for releasing you to a future with someone else who is able to be faithful and truthful. Someone you can marry and raise a healthy family with that you can be proud of. Most people are not like your last girlfriend. This kind of deception is so difficult it would send most normal people into a nervous breakdown. You needn’t worry that “the next love will be like the last one”

Having so little money is obviously affecting my health, appearrance and self-esteem - eating endless carbs is making me look fat and bloated and my skin bad.

You have one life, and when you’re 80, will you want to look back and think about how you squandered a four month stay in a new city because you missed familiarity, or will you want to look back at your choice to take it in stride and explore the city and meet new people and try new things.

It’s easy for me to type all this out in my comfortable house where I live with my parents, so I’m sure I’m being idealistic, but the thought is that if you zoom out far enough, nothing is as big of a deal as it seems, and you can overcome it and even learn to love it. 

I hope you learn to enjoy your stay in the new city, and I hope this comment wasn’t entirely patronizing. Good luck, mate"

"Same issue here - standing up is difficult for me - for me, it stems from no one being there to support me when I did try to stand up for myself. My partner said something to me today; its not finding the ability to express anger, or frustration, it's about trying to find your voice. "

Everyone knows when she does that, she’s moving on to practice her field making wayyy more, even while she’s supervised not in her own practice. She just got passed over for a promotion because of it. My company isn’t the type to fire good workers, but telling your employer you’ll leave if you don’t get a raise/ position x is a dangerous game, which usually doesn’t pay off at that company. "

"I do inventories. I was counting in a grocery store when a mid 50s woman turns the corner and bumps her cart on the ladder I was on and just says ""where's the apple cider vinegar?"" No apologies for almost knocking me off my ladder. I tell her that I don't work there, I'm from a private firm and don't know where the items are.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost had the time to tell her that I can get her someone to help her when she just tells me word for word ""Yeah yeah fuck you"" and rolls away.

&amp;#x200B;

I just yelled ""I hope your day is as wonderful as you are"" and she gave me the dirtiest look. I made the most condescending smug face I could and waved at her.

&amp;#x200B;

She had the nerve to complain to the store owner!!! I asked her if she took it as an insult and she said yes. Then I just told her that just means she was a bitch then because a nice person would have taken it as a compliment. She went nuts and stormed out of the store, knocking off an entire display of glass jars on purpose when she left the store.

If we stagnate while the rest of Europe continues along its bump-but-upwards track, getting fucked without lube by the Americans and Chinese whilst we're at it, that presents a very serious existential threat to the union as a sovereign entity.

Kanye normalised the fact that rappers can talk about things other than just killing people and drugs.
Cudi's whole album was about depression and all the emotions that would have been seen as ""not manly"".
Lil Wayne kinda brought gangster rap and Kanye's ""sound"" together. If you listen to the whole of Carter III, the production sounds a lot different to what you'd think the lyrics would be. I'm having trouble explaining it but I hope some of what I've said at least makes sense lol"

I will bring shattered hope.  I ride a white horse bearing a staff made of light. At first sight I will seem like a savior come to rescue people from despair. But when I come closer.

Yep.  But that scene is the only one that has entered my dreams from a horror movie.  Something about when his leg snaps and hits him in the head.

"Try some of the PAX live shows from the Penny Arcade guys. The guy that actually designs the official DnD rules, Chris Perkins, has been running an amazing 10+ year long campaign with them and Mike and Jerry (creators of Penny Arcade) are just fucking hilarious. Most years they swap around the 3rd and 4th people in their party, but they've had Wil Wheaton, Morgan Webb, Patrick Rothfuss has been a regular... I've never played DnD but those guys hooked me. I found out about them last year and went back and watched the previous VODs. Each session is about as long as a regular movie and they do it ~3-4 times a year (whenever there's a PAX) so its pretty digestable if you're just looking to kill some free time and might make you change your mind about watching or listening to campaigns.

We all went to Vegas and joked to them saying you guys should get married and they said sure, why not. I took him to the side a few hours later and said dude you sure?

He's got a song called Country Boy that is literally just pop country, wannabe hick, Fox News Republican buzzwords.

Googled the lyrics and this is the 2nd half of the song just to prove my point:

&gt; Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive

&gt; You'll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45

&gt; I got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck

&gt; And my idea of heaven is chasing whitetail bucks

&gt; And as a country boy, I know I can survive

&gt; Now, two flags fly above my land that really sum up how I feel

&gt; One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue

&gt; The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made

&gt; ""Don't Tread On Me"" is what is says and I'll take that to my grave

&gt; Because this is me I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs

&gt; And I've said it before but I'll say it again

&gt; 'Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand

&gt; And I've said it before but I'll say it again

&gt; 'Cause my family's always fought and died to save this land

&gt; And a country boy is all I'll ever be

I couldn't stop laughing when I heard this the 1st time because it is just so bad."

It's about understanding why you act and react the way you do. It's about recognizing when you're headed into old behavior and learning practice methods of hitting the brakes on that. It's about becoming more aware of *other peoples* actions and motivatons as well. Very positive changes in my life.

I won't get addicted to video games or caffine or alchohol but percisely *because* weed is so good and so relatively harmless I can't help myself. When the justification is there and the habits have been engrained it just becomes easier to keep going - detrimental effects are often social, you become okay with doing nothing because doing nothing feels good and fun (for a while). Your memory goes to shit and your emotions get a bit feral. There are very real consequences to weed even if they aren't severe in comparison to the life-ruiners. "

My husband doesnt have cancer but he is chronically ill and I never have enough time for work, kids, cooking, cleaning, and watching my husband die for the next 10 years. If one of my extended family told me they didnt have an hour a week because their work was unpredictable I would probably be so hurt by such an insensitive comment.

It's not divided equally and it's incredibly unfair sometimes, but in the end all our vices are our own.

"&gt; Creative fields tend to require you to bust ass without rewards for a while. My professors would tells us that most creatives careers start going well (ie: you only start making really good money) at 40.

Nah. You might be thinking of fine arts (painting, sculpture and shit), but technical arts like graphic design, videography, etc.—where you're selling your services instead of trying to sell something you made—are very employable at early levels. A graphic designer straight out of college (and working in a city) can expect starting pay around $40k. Unless you suck, you should be a Senior Graphic Designer by the 7- to 10-year mark (pulling 60-80k, depending on where you work) and an Art Director not long after that (if you want to switch to management).

Yeah, it's no STEM degree where your first job pays 100k, but you certainly don't have to ""bust your ass without rewards for a while."""

It's just that while projects are done collaboratively, programmers take a lot of pride in their work and need things to be done their way. As long as they deliver what is needed, there is no problem.

Problems only ever arise when people are teamed up and have too many competing ideas. As the saying goes, what one programmer can do in a month, two programmers can do in two months."

"A couple of years ago I had this coworker who was attractive, cool and smart. He seemed so perfect. Anyways, I quickly found out through social media stalking that he had a girlfriend. However, whenever she was brought up around me he would always lie! He would she was his cousin, his friends friend everything but his girlfriend. If your reading this, you probably are thinking it’s because he wanted to get with me(despite having a gf). But my insecurities don’t let me conceptualize people actually being into me so I was oblivious to this. Anyways, the more he lied the more it confused me. I would tell my friends at the time and looking for “evidence” of his girlfriend turned into a fun past time. Like if she uploaded a photo of them kissing on her Instagram we’d send it to each other and say “oh yeah sure look at his cousin”. Fast forward to the last day of the job, the guy asks me to borrow my laptop to look up a restaurant. I say sure (like a damn idiot) and give him my laptop. All of a sudden he hands it back to me saying “I see you’ve been lurking”. I responded, “what the hell are you talking about ?” He then proceeds to type only the letter “r” and the FIRST suggestion is his girlfriends Instagram page!!! He NEVER told me her name mind you. I was so embarrassed I wanted to jump out the 20 story high building. I said some bullshit lie about how I found it last night and was going to show him. After that I went to the bathroom to collect myself.

"I was in 7th grade and had a meeting with the principal, my mom, and the library teacher (this was a strange private catholic school).  We had MANDATORY weekly library class with this bat-shit crazy woman with no teaching degree or background, who happened to be the principal's best friend.  We're there, because I was fed up with how this woman constantly berated and insulted me (she did this to everyone, including kindergartners).  

She is behaving very defensively in this meeting as if she's done nothing wrong and is pretty vocally saying ""I never called you a baby!""  Which is why she thinks we're in the meeting.  Remembering that incident, I replied with ""I never said you called me a baby.  I'm saying you're saying you're sick and tired of my ""baby"" questions.""  It's a little thing, but it shut her the hell up.  This woman was another form of narcissistic evil.

"Generic Spoiler warning:

Based on a “true” story of a girl in Europe (I think, and it Americanizes it), the story surrounds the current trial of a priest who was responsible for the health of a sick girl, and is now accused of negligent homicide for deciding to take the girl off her anti-psychotic medications, as he came to believe she was possessed by devils. 

The priest believed the medications were keeping her consciousness “locked in” when the devils took control of her, causing her more anguish than any other type of possession. The story uses flashbacks to show us the story of the girl and what could either be her own schizophrenic hallucinations OR actual possession. 

We see her essentially raped by an invisible spirit while alone in her dorm room, after which her senses betray her, making food inedible and everyday noises sound like scratching silverware on a plate. 

Her body convulses in impossible ways, and she comes home, where her condition worsens, bringing the priest in for an exorcism. "

"Did you know that there are leftists (democratic socialists, anarchists - these make up most of Chapo's userbase from what I can tell) and communists (council communists, left-communists) that strongly disagree with Lenin and Leninism?

lol Literally your example of a revolt is the Kronstadt revolt, the suppression of which is considered a bad, unproletarian move by most anti-Leninist socialists/communists. I mean, the proletarian sailors clearly made socialist demands themselves against the party.

I won't argue against the hanging order for kulaks being bad, especially because it was not an organically worker-led action, perhaps because there was still a great deal of peasantry in unindustrialized Russia. Lenin unfortunately sought to manage the workers and their revolution too much, in part due to Russia's feudal backwardness still requiring more of the destabilizing effects of capitalism.

Did you also know that one of the organizational principles that Lenin 'founded'/pushed was **democratic** centralism? Which, while stricter than liberal democratic organization, was still fundamentally democratic. i.e. He clearly didn't hate democratic decision-making. He just hated bourgeois liberal democracies and overall thought that the more binding democratic centralism was necessary to prevent sectarianism considering the context of a capitalist world hostile to the Bolsheviks.

I don't even agree with Lenin's perspective on revolution (I tend to agree more with the aforementioned council communists: parties and unions are bullshit), but I just wanted to add on to your comment. This will probably fall on deaf ears anyway. Oh well."

"Mountain biking. 

It's expensive in bursts. When everything is working fine it's pretty cheap. Just gas to get to the trailhead and manageable clif bar expenses. 

Then you taco a 300 dollar wheel, blow out an 800 dollar fork, or take a hit to that 200 dollar helmet and have to replace it. You've got to have all sorts of gear, tools, spare parts and a rack to carry the bike on your car...which all adds up. And of course the bike itself is a few thousand bucks and needs to be replaced after 4 years or so due to the rough nature of the sport. 

Wouldn't trade it for the world, though. "

"Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berry Compote

Ingredients:
1 pound mixed fresh berries, such as strawberries and raspberries, sliced (4 cups) 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons water 6 large eggs, beaten 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice Unsalted butter, for the griddle Twelve 3/4-inch-thick slices of brioche (from 2 small loaves) Crème fraîche, for serving

Directions:

Step 1    
Preheat the oven to 225°. In a medium saucepan, combine the berries with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the water and bring to a simmer. Cook over moderate heat until the berries are softened and the sugar is dissolved, about 8 minutes.

Step 2    
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the heavy cream, the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and the ground spices. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

Step 3    
Heat a large cast-iron griddle and lightly butter it. Working in batches, dip half of the brioche in the egg mixture, turning once, until moistened but not soggy. Transfer the bread to the griddle and cook over moderate heat, turning once, until golden and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Transfer the French toast to a baking sheet, cover loosely with foil and keep warm in the oven while you cook the rest. Serve the French toast with the berry compote and crème fraîche.

Make Ahead
The berry compote can be refrigerated overnight. Serve warm."

"I graduated HS in 1989.  Teachers openly mocked gay kids.  If you were bullied for being gay no-one cared.

My friends weren't going to let him do it, but it was like, this is open for debate.  Even a year later  in college at a bar someone threw a full pitcher of beer at me from a table away and said ""faggot"" and literally no one including the management did anything.  FWIW I'm not hyper masculine but I was a DIv 1 athlete and not super effeminate or anything.... but I sound a little gay.  All the bullies I ever had or guys who I didn't know that picked up on me being gay were all closeted gay guys (my #1 bully later killed himself after coming out).

"Prader-Willi Syndrome actually CAN make you 100+ lbs overweight. In addition to several other things, it keeps the brain from sending the signals that you're full. People with PWS constantly feel like they're starving, and families have to lock up food, keep their child from ever being alone, etc so they don't keep eating. There have been cases where people's stomachs have literally burst because of it. It's a rarely-diagnosed disease, but scientists who study it agree it's probably quite under-diagnosed, as well. It's a truly horrific disease.

One of the reasons I mention this is because studying PWS and the way it affects the brain has helped scientists also understand how the brain reacts to chronic overeating and obesity. Turns out that as you overeat and become obese, it affects your brain in a similar way to PWS: your brain stops registering fullness as quickly as it should. That's how people (myself in the past included) end up eating an entire pizza at once. I used to use food as a coping mechanism; I was an addict and would get angry if I wasn't able to sneak a family-sized bag of chips into my room. That bag would last maybe two nights, if I was trying hard to pace myself. I would eat entire tubs of frosting. Looking back, I'm really disgusted with myself. But I also remember I rarely felt full until after my stomach was bloated to the point of pain.

I made it to 300 lbs. It's taken two years, but I'm down to 195 right now (low weight 165, but I have a spinal injury and currently am mostly bedridden: no exercise and needing to live off microwave meals because I physically can't cook is no bueno). But it's been really hard, and it's easy to slip up, because the brain damage being obese caused hasn't magically disappeared. I still don't feel full; I can only tell I've eaten enough if my stomach hurts. It's hard sometimes to keep from eating a meal larger than I strictly need because I don't physically KNOW that it's larger than I need.

This is one of the reasons people are rarely able to maintain significant weight loss. Long-term obesity causes lifelong physiological changes.

My point is, we're not all just lazy and uncaring. Many of us are trying, quite hard. We're often doing our best. I know it's difficult to understand if you've never been there yourself, but if you're going to be working with us, try and remember we're just normal people, too, yeah?"

"Whoa there, while I can understand skipping some (especially for Crossroads), that might be a bit overzealous.

Winter's Heart, I could see someone skipping to the end, but personally, I didn't see it as much of a slog at all. Crossroads has some great chapters at the very end, that are definitely worth reading, and even then only the Elayne and Faile chapters are particularly bad. But the Gathering Storm, by your instructions, you'd be skipping one of the favorite chapters by fans, Veins of Gold, which is chapter 50. Not to mention the major character development that happens in that chapter would leave you confused if you skipped it."

"That’s disgusting. That’s just disgusting. Our own PRESIDENT is now victim blaming sexual assault victims. Damn it. 

He wonders why, but he needs to look inward. He needs to look at that tweet and truly, seriously have one instance of empathy where he could realize why somebody wouldn’t report such a humiliating and abusive instance. It’s a brave thing to do. Let’s have him go into a courtroom in front of a ton of strangers, a lawyer discrediting everything you say, your attacker, and describe every humiliating thing that’s happened to you. Let’s have strangers comb through your background and history like it’s somehow relative to your character as a whole and whether or not it means you’d lie about something like that. 

Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if his backwards, disgusting mindset thinks something like “it’s not like she refused it, if she did, her body would’ve shut down” 

At this point I’m just refusing to read anything he puts on Twitter because it is so disgusting that I don’t want to talk about anything anymore. That’s disgusting, it’s just so gross, and I’m betting none of those stories will even matter at the end of it all. 

The POTUS makes me feel absolutely like I’m supposed to be okay with being somebody’s sex doll. I’m supposed to be okay just shutting up and accepting horrific things happening to women because he just can’t comprehend anything. That comment right there makes me want somebody to put him under a guillotine. Really I don’t understand why that’s acceptable to even say or put on Twitter 

If it was his wife or daughter, he’d have kavanaugh on a chopping block. But knowing him, he’s probably done that to someone at some point because I don’t even understand how anyone who isn’t a sociopath posts some of the shit he does. People have killed themselves over assaults.

By the end of the treatment he didn’t have cancer or AIDS. Pretty neat stuff, and very lucky for that guy.

"Heart of Darkness. It can be difficult to read the first few times. Not only was it written at the end of the 19th century, but the author (Joseph Conrad) was not a native English speaker so some of the word choice and syntax is...interesting to say the least. But I think it helps build the atmosphere.

The novella is very short, only 90 pages or so. It stretches as one long monologue given by the main character, Marlowe. But it builds such a dark and creepy atmosphere as you travel through central Congo with Marlowe and witness the horrifying atrocities which unfolded during the Belgian occupation of what is today the DRC. Some parts are difficult to read, and cast new light on what we as humans can justify doing. The worst part: all of the atrocities actually occurred. Some even worse than what the book describes."

"Pain. I have tremendous pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Sometimes my feet go numb just from walking. I have had MRIs, x-rays, cat scans, puppy scans, the full gamut of tests.  Met with a neurosurgeon because they found two cysts growing on my spine. He can't do anything for me until it gets much worse. It has been two years since that meeting and now they tell me they will not do another MRI to see if the cysts are still growing or not. Been tested for multiple myeloma, negative thankfully but it is hereditary and my mom died from it. I was originally told I needed to be checked every year moving forward. I called to make an appointment with the oncologist and he told me that I do not have MM and no further testing is necessary. I reminded him that he told me I need to get the test done every year. He denied he told me. I must have misunderstood him he said. I am 58 and still work 40-50 hours per week where I am on the go most of the time.

"It takes a lot of work to get out of loneliness. I've been there. The first step is developing the confidence that you have something to offer. For me it came when I read on methods to come off as more interesting. At first it sounds fake, but after a while you've exposed yourself to the masses. You start developing the confidence that when you talk to people, some people will respond and some won't. And that's ok. And out of all those interactions, you might make a friend. Or even find someone willing to be more. It takes time and patience. It won't happen overnight. You'll feel like a failure a few times. Don't give up. I was there. Now I'm not. "

"I had a conversation with my dad last night about preparing for his death, and I’m only 19 years old. It’s rough because he’s 45 and his father and grandfather both died in their fifties due to the same health issues he has been developing for the past 5 or so years. 

His health is declining rapidly and I’m terrified he won’t be here for much longer. The conversation really took a toll on me because my dad is my hero and I don’t think I could ever prepare for his death, especially if it’s within the next 10 years. 

God bless him and I truly hope he will be here for longer. He is really depressed about it and he spent an hour last night telling me I will be the one handling his funeral and burial and how he wants to be laid to rest. I’m really fucked up about it and got no sleep last night, working today is really fucking hard. 

Pretty much slowly killing me right now. "

"I was in a similar spot. It took getting fired from my third job for drinking while on duty then was stealing from friends and family just to have enough to keep the shakes at bay. If I didn't have a good relationship with my folks I would've been homeless as well. I was lucky enough to have access to free VA rehab center that I did a 90 day stint at. Completely secular and science based sobriety program was a bonus. But of course I thought I could the guy that could just have a couple. Then just binge drink occasionally. Then I went on a week long bender, quit cold turkey and had a withdrawal induced seizure. My dad found me seizing on the floor at 2am. I can't imagine what that was like for him. That was when I finally quit. ~5.5 years sober at this point and I now have a good job and own a home by myself. I hope things don't have to get as bad for you before you make a change.

But the most memorable, most satisfying, most wish-I-could-get-more-of-that have been the women with whom I had good chemistry and a great connection, not to mention that looks are a POOR indicator of sexual prowess.

Does it live up to the hype?  Yeah, kinda.  But once you've checked that box off your list, don't be surprised if it's not relevant anymore.  I've been with 10's and I've been with 5's, and tbh their looks have almost nothing to do with how we were together."

"The Jacobs incident.

I work in a clothing warehouse, one that is chock full of famous, overly expensive brands such as Marc Jacobs, Red Valentino, Emporio Armani, you get the idea. Sure, you can find a **relatively** cheap tshirt for about 100$, but on occasion shit gets crazy. This is one such occasion.

One day we received a strange crate. The fact we received a crate was strange on its own! Who the hell uses CRATES these days?  
I mean, for transporting relatively safe goods, dresses and shoes, that kind of stuff. I'm sure it makes sense for, say, nuclear warheads to be transported in nigh bulletproof crates. It took us all about three hours of combined effort to break the thing open. Keep in mind, in all six years I worked there, until that moment I've never seen a freaking **crate** show up. The worst thing so far was a pallet of well wrapped boxes. A little too well. But that took like extra five minutes to deal with.  
Anyways, back to the crate - since we never received crates, we didn't have a crowbar, so we had to borrow cinderblocks and try to smash the thing open.  
It took about three hours of pounding, and since the CEO got involved (frantically calling the supervisor, not beating the shit out of that crate) we realized there's something big in there.  
It finally collapses and inside we see... about 50kg of Styrofoam peanuts and a smaller box. Ok, that one is cardboard. Much easier. I go get the ""Japanese knife"" (apologies to the Japanese, this is just how it's called in Hebrew. I mean no harm), at which point the supervisor starts practically teleporting around and screaming we don't touch it with ""Japanese knives"" and pry it open with our hands instead. Shit looks suspicious already. Even more suspicious than before.  
More styrofoam peanuts and **another,** smaller box! What the fuck.  
We open that too, and inside there's a tightly wrapped... thing... at which point the supervisor dons latex gloves and starts very carefully unwrapping the thing.  
I'd like to note that at this point all work on other tasks stopped in order to deal with this one package.  
The thing in question turned out to be an average looking Marc Jacobs dress. Kind of slutty, somewhat more cleavage than usual, covered with these ""diamonds"" you usually see on preppy girls' sandals. A bit weird, but nothing too special.

At this point we were all give specific instructions on how to deal with this thing:  
Do not touch it without latex gloves.  
When interacting with this dress, you must wear disposable doctor masks.  
Do not, under any circumstances, let it go, as in, don't put it on a table or something.  
Do not, under any circumstances, get it off of the original hanger.

We get it through the system to register it in the warehouse and a couple hours later we get an order for that one dress and the price: 45000$. Forty. Five. Thousand. Dollars. For that one dress. In actual dollars, not NIS. That shit's worth a good car! First hand! I know jack shit about cars, but for forty five grand it's gotta be a damn good car!  
We now realize the panic is justified, so we give it top notch treatment - arrange it a special location, a shrine, practically, no other items touching it, warning signs all over the place, we'd bring hazmat suits to deal with it if we could afford them. And then, at night... it falls off the hook...

Now, as a reasonable human being my reaction was ""welp. Shit happens.""  
Management are, of course, not reasonable human beings. They tried to fire the last guy handling it, they tried to replace the entire staff, they tried getting forty five grand out of the last guy who touched it, it was the end of the world!  
We eventually shipped it off somewhere. No idea where, I refused to be the one to take on that order because of the sheer lunacy coming from upstairs. It just disappeared. No idea what happened to it, but the fact it just touched the (relatively clean) floor sent management into sheer lunacy and murder frenzy was a bit too much to handle."

I don’t know what to do. For now, I’m stuck in this mundane loop that everyone has. Day in, day out. School, home. Work. That’s what my whole life will be. A waste. And I don’t know what to do. I can’t reach out. 
I can only hope there’s something good in the afterlife. 

Thanks for letting me vent a bit here "

The two refugees acted agressive, pushed a female officer and kept shouting ""Fuck the police"".

The cops let them go...

The jurisdication has no real tools to handle criminal refugees.

As long as they dont commit a worse crime arresting them would just create paperwork and theyd be back in their refugee home within two hours. (quoting a friend if mine who is a police officer)

I dont mean to imply that all immigrants are criminals but the system definetly took in more refugees than it is able to handle under more than this aspect."

**Travel with Rick Steves** - anyone who grew up without cable television in the USA probably knows Rick Steves for his travel shows on PBS. He is witty, friendly, and has deeply thought provoking interviews with people around the world on all kinds of issues, centered around travel. This podcast is really a taping of his radio show, but if you follow his website you can write in questions for future shows or even call in when it’s live. Basically a podcast all about travel, and all the ways to approach it, all across the world. 



**DNA Today: A Genetics Podcast** - explores the fast changing world of genetics through interviews with scientists, medical professionals, and other people in the industry along with tips on graduate school, etc. I love it because I’m studying genetics, but I don’t think it’s so detailed that a layperson can’t keep up. Discusses a lot of hard questions that the field will have to answer soon, like whether we should be able to clone live people or whether we should modify people’s genes like we do in crops. 

**The All Creatures Podcast** - two zoologists discuss the current events in conservation and biology, with most episodes focused on a single species and what we can do to help it survive. Also dispels common myths about certain animals. Great chemistry between the hosts and interviewees. I remember when this was first advertised here on Reddit and they only had 8 episodes, now they’ve really taken off and they’re my go-to when I’m in a mood to be reminded why I’m pursuing conservation as a career. They care so much about wildlife and it’s contagious and covers many interesting topics (like artificial insemination in rhinos).

**The Field Guides** - hosted by two field biologists who explore different topics like wildflower ecology and narrate their hike as they walk through a landscape. They often have interviews with other professionals in biology, ecology, and natural resources, and have great chemistry. It’s like taking a walk with your favorite professors during a field trip, and I think the general layperson can easily understand the topics as they take time to explain them. 


**The Energy Blueprint Podcast** - hosted by Ari Whitten, a health guru and science nerd that spent years researching how to regain his energy after a battle with chronic fatigue. Interviews scientists and doctors on the cutting edge of medical research and backs everything he finds with lots of research and studies, like how we have swung too far into fearing the sun and skin cancer,  and now are suffering from not getting enough vitamin D, or how critically vital sticking to a sleep schedule is for our circadian rhythm and overall health. He’s not afraid to disagree with his interviewees if he thinks the science indicates something other than what they’re putting forth.

"Humanity as a whole has done this! We scared birds away from our crops for so long they gave up on it and this allows for insects to eat them instead. So now we have to use pesticides to get the bugs away but its not very good for us. But we have done this for so long aswell, the agricultural economy would suffer too much if the crops yielded so much less. "

"Plus the main reason it was a big deal was Franz Ferdinand became heir only after both Franz Joseph's son and Franz Joseph's brother died (Franz Ferdinand being Franz Joseph's nephew). 

Franz Joseph's son, Rudolf, died in a murder-suicide with his 17 year old mistress in what is known as the Mayerling incident, after the hunting cottage where it happened. The Crown Prince was unstable, and there's a lot of rumors about what happened (like he was already suicidal, or she died of a botched abortion). But what is clear is that the resulting struggle by factions within the empire as a result of Crown Prince Rudolf's death is what inspired the black hand. 

TLDR: Lust for a 17-year old girl caused WWI.

Also fun fact, Rudolf had a daughter, but despite Austria having fought long wars to put an Empress on the throne, decided to ignore her for a male heir. Archduchess Elisabeth went on to become a social democrat and was known as ""The Red Archduchess"". She left her first husband, but could not marry her second husband for almost 20 years, divorce first being illegal in Austria. Her second husband, being a social democrat spent quite a bit of the Nazi era in jail, including being sent to Dachau. "

"The only problem I have with Gimlet is the way they advertise their shows.

"You and I are in the exact same boat. My calorie max daily is 1100 calories. I am always STARVING and it fucking sucks. Ive tried the diet pills. The chugging water before each meal, the only one meal a day, the no snacks, no soda, no sweets. 

And it sucks. 

But you know what? It gets easier. You gotta do it every day and it sucks so much, but eventually it gets easier. And You can do it. 

The thing thats helping me the most is small portions. Sure a big mac is almost 1500 calories. But if I only have a sliver of that and some rice and veg I'm happy. Instead of a full cookie ill let myself have half. Sure I'm still going slightly over my calories, but its helping me wean off my food cravings. And it might help you too. And even if it doesn't, you got this! 

I love ice cream. But its high in calories. So ill freeze a container of extra light whip cream. It tastes just like vanilla icecream. Or gramcrackers with jello on top and a little whip cream. Tastes like pie but its lower calories.  Its the little things that help me and they might help you too. 

Its okay if you struggle. Its okay if you fall back and start again. Fuck I know I am. But your gonna get there and all your hard work is gonna pay off.

"While of course there are things about Luke and Anakin that could seem like they obtained their skills easily, it's not even close as a comparison.

Anakin could pilot things well in TPM and build droids. That's it. He had no other skill. He also had R2 helping him. Then he got 10-15 years of training every single day, and despite being the chosen one, was defeated by the droids in a factory, was defeated by Dooku, was defeated by Obi-Wan. He is whiny, not everyone liked him or respected him, he was arrogant and hungry for power. So while he was very good at certain things, he got trained for years at those and still failed many times. He also had big character flaws.

Luke simply pressed the buttons at the right moment in ANH when he destroyed the Death Star. He also did the same thing shooting small animals in his T16. And the movie establishes him as a good pilot before that as well. He is still whiny and reckless though. He still got knocked out by Tusken Raiders. He still got destroyed by Vader. He still would have died by the hand of Sidious if Vader hadn't saved him. And that's after years of training. Besides, his ease in learning the Force is explained by him being Anakin's son. Both Anakin and Luke have flaws, both trained for years and are defeated by more experienced people than them many times.

None of that happens to Rey, who masters every skill with 0 training. She's just a great pilot with no explanation. She can just shoot blasters well, fight well in melee, use the Force extremely well with no training, she even knows how to speak Wookie ffs. She has no character flaws. Everyone likes her and she just somehow escapes any situation she's in, despite facing more experienced people. By the end of TLJ, Rey has used the Force for like 5 days with no training yet she is able to lift dozens of boulders while not even hardly trying. She has also used a lightsaber for like 10 min her whole life yet is able to defeat 4 of Snoke's elite personal bodyguards at the same time... yeah right. She even saves Kylo  there, Kylo who is a lot more experienced than her.

Anakin and Luke are not Mary Sues, Rey is. And unlike them, Rey is just a random girl from nowhere. So her strength in the Force doesn't even make sense. "

It turns out that you need to use the (until now mostly useless) Gust spell to push the vine so that you can grab it and swing across the vine. No indication of how to do that, and I eventually had to break down and visit a walkthrough to figure it out.

We hadn’t turned it on and when it had been on the volume and station were different. Strange but we shrugged it off. Not an hour later we were upstairs and heard the door at the bottom of the staircase open and slam. Then loud footsteps started running up the steps and down the hall towards us. We all looked down the hall but no one was there. We then checked the door that had loudly opened but it had been locked the whole time. Needless to say we were spooked.

"A good therapist works on what you need. I spent a lot of time working on developing good sleep patterns and sleep hygiene, which was so beneficial to my life. I was taught how to help myself, such as developing organisational and social skills, developing realistic goals to work towards and managing anxiety. For example I was taught how to make an ‘anxiety tree’ where you mentally map out the possible outcomes of something, and realise that, most of the time, even if things go wrong the fact they’ve gone wrong isn’t going to end my life. Also, just attending therapy improved my self discipline and self confidence. 

I also went to counselling (where you can talk about your life) which had a bit more talking, but only so I could try and understand my perspective on something, and understand where my thought patterns were right and why my emotions were valid. I didn’t have to talk about my childhood, I’d bring it up if relevant to the conversion."

If you go to a bar or arcade or game store etc and see someone interesting that you want to talk to, your brain will sabotage you and make it seem super scary. So what you can do is say “fuck it, I’m not going to deal or worry about this shit.” And carry on with your activities.

My parents moved into my grandpas house for roughly a year after his wife of 58 years died and he had his 4th heart attack, and their neighbors kept an eye on their place while they were gone. Grandpa got much better so they decided to move back home, so I helped them pack up and we showed up around 10 pm and started trying to get the backyard fence open, and we’re struggling because it’s rusted due to not being used.

Next thing we know, the neighbor comes around the fence in his boxers holding a shotgun to our faces, thinking we’re trying to break in. 3 years later and every time I go to my parents house and see him next door, I put my hands up and say “don’t shoot” and we all have a good laugh. In hindsight he totally could’ve accidentally murdered us, but he proved how great of a neighbor he truly is!"

I feel like it is a combination of things that can really beat a person down. It really sucks when everybody expects more from you than other people. It makes you want to stop caring and destroys your motivation. I don't know how to describe it. On several occasions I was given a lower score on assignments and tests than a classmate with the exact same answer/work because 'more is expected' of me. I have been at work and done something that would normally be rewarded then told that I have to do the task better than the standard in order to be rewarded the same as other people. It really takes its toll over the years. I have given up trying to be motivated and do things better. it has caused me a lot of anxiety and depression. it really sucks to do things that would normally be rewarded then being told that it isn't good enough because there are higher imaginary standards that only you are held to.

They were in a toxic relationship, and she showed up one day when they were arguing and they caused a scene in front of customers. She broke up with him and he was on the verge of getting fired, so he decided his best solution was to quit.

No one was particularly surprised to see him leave, but we were all surprised when about 20 minutes later we found out that he had taken a massive dump in one of the dressing rooms before he left.

""Many failings in life""? Dr. Ford is extremely successful by any reasonable definition. She is a professor of Statistics at Palo Alto University and has worked as a research psychologist for *Stanford University*. You know, that one. The one that's one of the best universities in the world?

&gt;Ford ""specializes in designing statistical models for research projects in order to make sure they come to accurate conclusions,"" as summarized by Helena Chmura Kraemer, a Stanford professor emeritus in biostatistics who co-authored a book and several articles with Ford.

The picture you are trying to paint here of Dr. Ford is so incredibly... so surreally outside of reality that I think you should seriously **seriously** reconsider where you get your information. All of that shit about being rebuffed by Kavanaugh comes from **literally nowhere**. 


Also, what are you talking about ""wait until there wasn't time""? Justice Kennedy is still on the bench. There is no vacancy. Sen. McConnell unilaterally decided to leave a vacant seat on the Supreme Court for 400 days. There is literally no time limit or ticking clock. Sen. Feinstein chose to withhold the allegations for several weeks because of Dr. Fords severe concerns about her safety and, you know, the undeniable fact that her entire life will change forever upon coming forward with her story? She's already been threatened into moving and is incessantly harassed and will basically have to have heightened security the rest of her life. The POTUS himself, a man with 18 accusations of sexual abuse himself, implied she was a liar. Is it really that hard to imagine why it took Dr. Ford a few weeks to make a decision that would change her life?


But seriously dude. The fact that you actually believe what you just wrote means you should seriously reevaluate where you get your information. **None** of it is sourced from anywhere but alt right message boards and dirt rags. "

"Small disclaimer i completely support Trump, but I think you hit the nail on the head.  Despite what the republicans see as a two-year long tantrum by the democrats, their real issue lies in that they are leaderless.  It doesn't even have to be a politician.  Even Jon Stewart provided what i believed to be a moral compass for younger informed people.  But what's going on now can't be the answer.  It seems to just be such a parade of pure hatred for one man with no real direction.  I don't know what the answer is for them, I mean we are all in this together.  Good leaders for both parties only benefits us, the people.  Come midterms, the Democrats will be learning some very hard lessons about their recent behavior.  It's not the fault of dem voters, its the elected ones at the top.

If you want to be happy, act happy. It will eventually take (assuming you actually do act happy most of the time). 

The more 'concrete' the thoughts are, the better it works though. So in CBT they have you write out the 'ideal' thoughts. Writing them down makes them a lot more real, I guess. It really is fascinating!

I think our brains are just computers made of meat. The inputs determine the outputs, that's for sure. 

It also works with your body. If you stand and walk and breathe like a confident person, you'll actually become significantly more confident.

Before that, he was holding himself back, convinced he was a good person through it all--until he saw the Grey Matter Interview, and finally let go of that facade.

"Okay, who brought the dog?"
I only like it because the show and the host are so unintentionally very very funny. No self-awareness at all. 
"First of all, self respect is all about how YOU feel about YOURSELF. No one else can define that for you. You might not personally feel comfortable wearing revealing clothing, but if someone else does, who are you to say they don’t respect themselves? They’re doing what they feel comfortable with.

Second, I don’t think respect in general has anything to do with clothing, or even sexuality. I respect people who are kind, hard working, open minded, etc. I respect those who are good people. What kind of clothes you wear or how many people you have consensual sex with or how “modest” you are have nothing to do with whether or not you’re a decent person, so it doesn’t affect whether or not you’re deserving of respect. 

Next, just because someone is attractive and may be dressed in a revealing manner doesn’t give me license to be a creep. That’s something I’ll never understand. I’m a bisexual female, so I can understand the attraction to the female body, yet never once have I seen a woman dressed “immodestly” and thought “oh she’s dressed that way because she wants me to objectify her” or “she’s dressed that way for my pleasure.” Who knows why she’s dressed that way. Maybe she just is feeling herself and feels confident and comfortable that way. Maybe it’s super hot outside and she wants to dress light. Maybe she wants to impress a special someone. Or maybe she really does want to be seen as attractive - most people do! That doesn’t mean you want people to degrade you or make gross comments or make you feel unsafe. So when I see a hot woman, I take a quick glance, keep my thoughts and hands to myself, and move on with my day without making her feel unsafe or degraded by treating her like an object just because she’s showing some skin.

And finally, as much as I like both men and women, I’m not looking at minors at all. I don’t care if a 16 yr old is in a bikini or short shorts or a crop top or whatever the fuck. That’s a fucking kid. Sure there are plenty of teens with adult-looking bodies, but as soon as I find out they’re underage, the attraction is gone. I think about myself when I was a teen, and while I was becoming an adult in some ways, I was also very much a kid in others. It’s disgusting to me to think of someone who’s in that stage of their life being ogled at and harassed by a grown ass adult who damn well knows better. I don’t care what they’re wearing, they’re not a sexual being in my eyes since I’m an adult.

A lot of problems or things we have difficulties with but have no name for are actually common. It helps to know this.  Also often our problems stem from something explainable and logical and just knowing about it and being educated on it does wonders. I like the example of this on here on another comment: highly sensitive peoples/co-dependents

There are traits people describe on reddit etc and i read them and just think of all the people i know with them including myself and amazed at how many of them are normal or has solutions to them. "

"I'd create a religion and then disappear from the face of the earth, get the popcorn out and watch from afar as they squabble over whether I'm real, whether another god is real or whether I even exist. All of this can be experienced within a single hour, because, being god, I'd be able to comprehend it all without needing to experience it in real time. 

Then when I'm bored, I'll simply snap my fingers and create another world to entertain me. This is what I imagine a real, sentient god would do, we'd be nothing but an experiment to it. "

"Over a half an hour was removed from the movie, and almost all of the footage is literally destroyed. 

&gt; &gt; Sadly, he probably won’t get the chance to release a director’s cut, since the film came out prior to the rise in special edition DVDs. The unused footage was packaged off to a Transylvanian salt mine for storage, so when he came looking for the footage it was in such poor shape it was no longer usable. Anderson himself has recently reaffirmed this, seemingly dashing any hope of the lost footage re-emerging from a black hole, like the titular ship itself.  

As for what was removed, well, this is a content warning, I guess. Descriptions of sexual torture follow. And tooth stuff. If you thought what made it into the movie was bad, oh boy. 

&gt; Effects supervisor Dave Bonneywell has described his time shooting the sequence and some of the gruesome details that didn’t make it. Deleted shots include a female crew member who had her mouth held open by clamps, while a crazed guy performs amateur dentistry by drilling screws into her teeth. Another unlucky chap has his legs smashed apart by steel bars and crawls away leaving parts of them behind, while another crew member had her breasts torn off. The scene also included more cannibalism and sex, with adult performers being hired to simulate the... errr, intensity of the scene. The director realized most of it probably wouldn't be used, but he filmed it regardless.

"Haha, deadline is the most funny part. It is when it becomes obvious to everyone that all you was saying was right and they had to listen to you but they still don't give a fuck. The deadline or any fuckup instead of giving them a hint to start listening to you gives them an idea that you are the source of a problem, because if there were no you no one would see and understand problems.  
I'm coding since 1994 in many languages and while it would be logical to respect my experience more and more instead every year these stupid uneducated jerks disrespect me more and more. All these kids who after school took a 3 months course of Python so they are now ""senior developers"" -- all the IT sphere full of this shit and also no one outside of IT knows it.  
And why is this cancer possible? Simply because there is no way to estimate the quality and knowledge. When at the factory you are making metal things, teapots, bricks or anything that simple and physical it's easy to everyone to see if you are doing it right or if the product is shit. If you are a surgeon the quality of your work is also obvious and you can be sued and even be inprisoned if you was doing something bad intentionally. But doing shit in software developing is fucking unpunishable. Tones of lies, sabotage, irresponsibility, everyone pretending they have any knowledge, all these fake resumes and job interviews led by the same lame interviewers. It is an industry that some dozens of years ago probably had the best minds in it but today a so called ""developer"" is absolutely stupid compared to molecular biologist, news analytic, etc."
"My husband went through this with his ex of 5 years. She fucked him up good after learning everything she did. She was meeting random guys on a MMO. They would fly her out and fuck her. One guy took her to Italy (she said she went with her mom) and bought her a car. Then went on to fucking some guy they knew from the area. She was also telling every guy that my husband was abusing her. Totally not true. 

Anyways, he completely lost himself for a good while. Became very angry, drank a lot and was destroying friendships. He finally came through though. I don’t know when. I don’t know how. I sometimes wonder if I helped him when he finally met me 3 years later. We’ve been together 9 years and will be married 6 next month. 

I know it hurts and you’re feeling pretty fucked up right now. You’ll get through this. I promise. Message me if you need to vent or lash out on someone. Also, please take care of yourself. You’re worth something. She’s the asshole. And if you haven’t already, please get tested. "

"I found it easier to deal with depression by removing measurements of happiness or obsessing over how I should or shouldn't feel. Because I always came up short. On a spectrum of people I have lower lows than most, but my highs be them neutral at best, don't feel bad. And that's good. It helped me to stop searching hor happiness and just lean back and enjoy what I could day by day.   
  
I don't know if that helps you though, mental illness a fucker for complexity. Either way, I love you internet person and have a good day!"
"Take on an alter ego in your head. Hold an image of how the person you want to be would speak and act, and then pretend it’s you. You don’t need to let self conscious or anxious because it’s a persona you’re carrying out. Before you know it, it’ll feel natural, and you’ll have evolved socially. 

It also helps to decide to commit to changing, and committing to the commitment. If that makes sense. 

It worked for me anyway. Went from being an incredibly self conscious, unconfident guy to really loving life and myself. Jiu jitsu was a great thing for me also. You get fit, learn your self and your mind, and your confidence grows at the same time.
Go for it and remember life happens once, don’t waste it living inside negative thoughts. "

"Things are super spread out here and public transportation is nonexistent in most places, so unless you live in a big city (like Chicago or New York) that has tons of buses/trains to get around, you need to drive.

The most you’ll ever hear is some nervous shuffling/confusion, and people trying to figure out where the money, and who ordered the pizza in the first place.
Maybe the occasional people having sex, and then the occasional casual drug user that ordered.

But usually, the customers surprisingly are pretty nervous of the transactions themselves. Almost always do they have it already planned out on their end, to avoid any added awkwardness, or it’s just going to somebody at work/or a hotel.

Now, if we’re talking tips... I’ve been offered everything from drugs(usually weed or the occasional cocaine), to random nicknacks from some kind of event they person ordering is throwing, to being offered deals on trailer hitch’s they were selling. The craziest I’ve ever heard, is when I used to be at Domino’s, we had an older 65ish year old black man working for us. Very 70s “groovy” kind of vibe he carried. Well everyone in a while we have this single, not very heavy-set, 50-60 year old woman would call for a delivery and specifically ask for this driver. Apparently every time he’d go there, she’d at least give him a blowjob, if not an entire mini-fuck-sesh. "

That was 2 years ago and nothing really changed, but I grew out of the usual bad thoughts and now I only really have those “why am I even alive” maybe like a few days a month which is better than before.

I totally get what you’re going through. The idea of just having to go through it is scary, but having no one to help bear the load is frightening. I hope everything works out for you!"

"Untreated chronic pain.

I have [polycystic kidney disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes), and for the last four years, (at least while I was still physically able to do so,) I saw doctor after doctor after doctor in search of adequate pain management. In that time, I have not been prescribed anything for pain at all. 

Before that, up until a bit over 4 years ago, I had a life, because I had a doctor providing me with hydrocodone, which had turned out to be the only effective medication against my pain after I had tried every single alternative narcotic and non narcotic medication that existed there at the time. (Surgery had been ruled out as an unnecessary risk.) I used Lortab (hydrocodone with reduced acetaminophen) responsibly and sparingly for years, and never experienced any addiction or withdrawal. Only relief and a chance to live my life instead of survive it. 

Then, I was forced to move across the country in order to access other kinds of healthcare blocked from me in my previous home state. The new federal opiate laws went into effect not long after I moved. My new home state turned into an even worse medical neglect death trap, and now I'm not well enough to move again in order to save myself. 

My physical and psychological health have been utterly destroyed by the complete void of available pain managenent in the US. I can't function at all now, even basic things in my own home. I can't leave the house anymore, and even if I could, I have exhausted every single doctor I am able to access and been abandoned by every single one. I spend all of my time laying around in agony, crying, screaming, mangling inanimate objects, viciously self harming just for one source of pain to distract me from the other, and wishing for death. I have no will to live and no reason to want to. I'm probably only still alive because of rage towards the people responsible for doing this to me. One of the questions I have been asked by many of the doctors I've seen, after I explained my massive list of new and worsened physical and psychological symptoms (not included in this post), they genuinely wanted to know why i hadn't killed myself yet, and how I could still be alive after everything that happened to me. They weren't going to help me. They were just curious. I have also had numerous offers to help me access assisted suicide - while denying me access to the medication that would make suicide unnecessary. 

This is a death trap millions of Americans are stuck in with no way out. At least one in ten suicides in the US is now caused by untreated chronic pain, and that doesn't count all the early ""natural"" deaths (mostly heart failures) caused by symptoms resulting from the stress and trauma of being tortured in constant pain because of government mandated medical neglect.

Chronic pain patients across the country are now left with only two options: suffering, or suicide. **We need the help of able bodied people if we are to have any chance at life.** We have been completely abandoned by our doctors and legislators. We have been rendered powerless to save ourselves. And as long as nothing changes, more of us will continue to die every day. 
_____

This is not just a problem for chronic pain patients. Unreasonable opiate restrictions mean that **whoever you are, YOU TOO are only one painful accident, injury or illness away from being tortured and neglected** by the doctor or hospital you would go to for help. It doesn't matter how obvious your pain or its cause is. It will not be treated because doing so puts doctor's business and career at risk because of new federal and some states' laws based in misinformation and opiate hysteria instead of science, medical need, or compatibility with pain patients' basic human rights to life, liberty and happiness. And doctors always choose to protect themselves and their business over helping their patients. You aren't the exception because your doctor has been nice. It's a problem caused by federal law, and nobody is immune to that. 


The following is only the most recent story I've seen of an experience like this at an American hospital. 

""*For people who think that the refusal to treat pain is just for chronic pain patients and they don't feel that they shouldn't help fix this issue.
This is (name removed). she got severely burned on her arm and went to the emergency room she was denied any pain medication while she was there and was sent home with nothing and was also was not given anything for when they did the debridement. So if you think this problem won't effect you, think again.*""

More information, written by another victim of the American pain crisis:

A little CDC forced honesty from their new report released 8/31/18 at CDC.gov:

Opioid deaths: 14,487 of 325.7 million people died in 2016 from LEGAL PRESCRIPTION opioids. That's .000004% of the population! Now why is there a hysteria over PRESCRIPTION opioids?

Good question!

Especially when alcohol related deaths are 88,000 of 325.7 million. That's a much BIGGER number!! Yet... No hysteria over alcohol

1.3 million people are injured and 35,000 die in car wrecks per year. Just to give you a reference. A WAY BIGGER number. No hysteria over that. (edited to correct information)

Hmmm. 🤔

Maybe it's because this is how they reported opioid deaths to the media:

'Drug overdose deaths in 2016 reached a NEW RECORD HIGH.' 'Drug Overdose Mortality: A RECORD NUMBER of drug overdose deaths occurred in 2016: 63,632, A RECORD 19.8 PER 100,000 PERSON'S.' (19.8/100,000 is still only .0001% but it looks BIGGER reported this way.)

Sounds like everybody is dying from opioids doesn't it? Now why did they say 66,632 died when I said 14,487 up top? That's a BIG difference!

Well...CDC combined LEGAL, law abiding citizen prescription opioid deaths, with ILLEGAL heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl deaths!

Why would anybody want to DO that? It's kind of misleading isn't it? Well...it makes a BIGGER NUMBER.

Where's all the hysteria and 'crisis' for the 1,300,000/325,700,000 each year DYING of car wrecks!!? I can make that sound awful! And it is! But it's still only .003% of the population and people have decided it's worth the RISK:BENEFIT RATIO to drive. And the government lets them.

Because of the way the CDC reported opioid deaths, and others' agendas, a wildfire of hysteria resulted, causing disabled by pain patients to lose their opioid medicine, their ability to function, their dignity as they are treated like drug addicts, and any quality of life. Imagine an Ice cream headache 24/7/365 covering different parts of your body. You can't think with this type of ceaseless pain. You want to die.

This is something that is personal and each person has to decide the risks they take in life. Risks are everywhere, and people have to decide if something is worth the benefit. It's called 'informed consent' when you know of the risk before you take it. 

Shouldn't people in agonizing pain be able to decide if the RISK:BENEFIT RATIO of .000004% is worth the benefit of being able to get out of bed and function? Work? And not want to die from tortuous pain?

Doesn't make sense, single moms are facing homelessness as they can no longer work due to unbearable pain, MS, lupus, etc etc; also Vets who risked their lives for our country with painful injuries, now lie there wanting to die. Elderly people lie there sobbing with NO RELIEF, day after day, wishing they would die. Where's the hysteria over that?

We have no voice. People/media listen to those in power. Not the multitudes suffering at their hands. Please share the TRUTH. 

ALL the above information can be found here: Where things are in context. A LOT harder to get information here than in the hysteria promoting news. And they're counting on that, apparently.

"Join a gym, go at the same time every day (or every other day or every week or whatever works for your life) and exercise. It doesn't matter if you don't want/need to get into shape, stick to the schedule. Try and find something you enjoy, treadmill was my favorite.

Be extra nice to the employees, they'll get to know you pretty fast. Soon you'll start recognizing the 8pm Thursday Night Crowd, or that dude that's like *really* in to the elliptical machine, or the old lady who kicks ass at Pilates.

Maybe you'll make a friend, but you'll definitely feel like you have like a special club you belong to. You can tell by that head nod you exchange with bro-tank-dude on your way out of the locker room. And exercise is supposed to be good for depression, so that's a plus.

You can also do this at a bar, but from experience, it's kind of sad when all the bartenders know you by name. Plus you won't get the exercise. However, gyms usually don't serve alcohol, so maybe do both just to be safe."

"I’ve been EXACTLY in your shoes. Unfortunately for me, my father is a clinically diagnosed narcissist (*yes, clinically diagnosed, not Dr. Reddit diagnosed*) and I was too terrified of him exploding on me to blatantly call him out.

But, that doesn’t appear to be your case from what I’m reading, in which case, I will pass on this pearl of wisdom I wish I’d learned sooner.

**You are not responsible for your mother’s wellbeing.**

Really, you’re not. You are not obligated to carry her world on your shoulders, and if she is ignoring boundaries, then you have a right as an existing human being to protect yourself. 

**You don’t have to worry about what will “initiate action rather than send her deeper into a hole.”**

I cannot emphasize this enough. This is how she is trapping you - whether intentionally or unintentionally, she is able to rope you in because you want to help her see the error of her ways and go get help. This is especially the case, considering she is ignoring boundaries you are trying to put up to keep the relationship healthy.

You are not obligated to carry her, or convince her to see change. If she is a problem for your mental health to the point where it is an answer for an AskReddit “What is slowly killing you?” Then you need to protect yourself, and stay firm on your boundaries, or walk away entirely.

If that’s possible, anyway. I struggled with it, because I faced serious retaliation I couldn’t afford to deal with if I flat out rejected his attempts to rope me in.

**But if retaliation is a factor into possibly remaining in such a dynamic, this knowledge alone can make it easier, because you don’t become emotionally invested.**

You don’t think you can help or “save them” if you said the right things, you accept it as a situation where a person is violating your personal emotional boundaries, and it is unfortunately in your better interest to just play along rather than respond with a firmer position on boundaries. 

I listen to my dad talk, and I play the meow-mix song in my head while I keep a straight face. I’m able to regurgitate what he’s said back to me if he challenges me, but all I really hear, is the meow-mix song. The stress to save the unsavable is no longer there, as I no longer try to take in his emotional energy, I just sit there and nod and smile, and play the meow-mix song in my head until he’s satisfied with talking about things no parent should be telling their kid. 

I never remember what he’s told me later, unless it’s in an easily deletable text. 

**TLDR:** You don’t have to save your mother. Especially if she refuses to be saved. "

"Id reply to everyone but theres a lot of supportive people, i genuinely appreciate the advice, im going to find myself a group to join when im next in i think, my issue isnt meeting people its my anxiety slamming me with so much self doubt i cant fight it.

I struggle fighting that self doubt and it fucking hurts.

"The store I work in in the UK is closed from 10 - 7, but we still have people working all night, I'm pretty sure most stores are like that. Seems even better for socially anxious people - I used to work until midnight and for the last two hours I'd just listen to NPR podcasts."
"I'm glad I was raised in the 80s before parents were terrified of everything. What do you think is going to happen,  the kid is going to suddenly want to fall in love with his brother? 

I saw the movie Predator 2 when I was 7. That movie opens with a woman screaming in pleasure while frantically riding a guy, shows everything but a close up of penetration. Then the predator comes out of nowhere and skins them alive and hangs them from the ceiling. 

I thought it was a great movie,  but I was never inclined to base any part of reality on what I saw

But you know why I will? For those that love me and depend on me.  I'm kind of useless being sick all the time, but I know for a fact I have a lot of people worth fighting for.  Plus for the selfish side, there's a lot of things I still want to do, see, as long as I can.  As long as its not a lost cause, I'm fucking fighting. 

Also, consider a new endocrinologist.  My last one was terrible the first time around, did the biopsy without any ultrasound (told me to ""not move or you could die"") and did real shitty post operative care.  Now I have a really compassionate doc who I have a feeling will be much more helpful as I adjust again. 

Keep fighting my friend. We got dealt a real shitty card, but that doesn't mean it will always be shitty. "

I got a part time tutoring job for a company that paid over $20/hr because of my engineering degree so if you’re looking for part time try that.

I just received an offer for a position and the only way I heard about the position and knew I can apply is through someone familiar with the industry randomly suggesting it.

My point is that if you’re looking for part time work try to find something that actually wants your major to do the work and if you’re having trouble finding full time work, search in places you haven’t considered because it might turn out that you are qualified and like the work being done.

We’re all hanging out and then we hear a horrific scream except we’re all anti-social twerps so we get annoyed and say it sounds like a dying parrot. 
The screaming continues a little longer than any usual annoying student’s would so one of my friends checks it out.

In the middle of breaking down some drywall I could see what I though was a person sorta peaking out around the corner closer to the entrance. I look up and said ""Sorry there is some construction going on. It's unsafe for you to be here."" I then just went back to my duty. After I had broken the part in half I looked up to see them still there so I walked closer but noticed I wasn't talking to a person, it was more like a dark mass I was talking too.

1. Critical Role: A Dungeons and Dragons podcast done by a fantastic group of voice actors, I believe there are around 150ish episodes (they’re in the middle of their second campaign) each episode is 2.5 hours so it’s great for long car rides and walks. 

2. Stuff You Should Know: A classic, Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant cover thousands of topics ranging from the History of Cheese to Lava Lamps to Electroconvulsive Therapy, each episode ranges from 30 minutes to an hour. Incredibly informative and filled with fun facts that you can use to annoy your friends.

3. Alice Isn’t Dead: Created by the folks who made Welcome to Night Vale, it’s a story driven podcast about a trucker trying to find her lost wife. Shorter episodes, 20-30 minutes, but very immersive with a bit of a spooky vibe. Narrated by Jasika Nicole, who you’ll definitely fall in love with.

4. The Moth: The concept of this podcast interests me the most out of all of these, normal people (not storytellers) tell stories about their lives during live shows in towns all across the US and those stories are compiled into episodes with a central theme. This podcast has the most “rawness” to it and it’s just a nice way to kill time. Episodes range from 10 minutes to about an hour.

All of these are on the Apple Podcast App btw!"

I hop up onto this table, undo my belt, lower my jeans and pull it out.  He grabs my nuts and does some squeezing.  In the midst of this, an erection formed before his eyes.

"Part of your comment is steeped in misinformation that I've heard many variations of I'm afraid, here's what Wikipedia has to say

&gt;After learning that the first assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and decided to move to a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge.[76] At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum.[citation needed] Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital.[citation needed] Driver Lojka stopped the car close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up.[citation needed] The latter stepped forward and fired two shots from a distance of about one and a half metres (4.9 feet) using a Belgian-made 9×17mm (.380 ACP) Fabrique Nationale model 1910 semi-automatic pistol.[citation needed] Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074.[77] According to Albertini, ""the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess."""

"I'll say this, even as someone who greatly enjoyed The Last Jedi: part of what the original trilogy has going for it (which few people seem willing to admit) is that they are extraordinarily camp. People hear the world camp and assume it means gay men being flip and sassy, but that's just one facet of what the notion of camp can be.

The initial Star Wars films are made from a highly specific and somewhat naïve point of view, with tongue almost never in cheek. Take a look at the very first Star Wars movie: the good guys are stalwart, square-jawed heroes, the bad guys are Nazis and monsters. There's a cowboys-and-Indians feel and a Japanese feel, both seemingly put in just because the creator was into these things. The dialogue is almost absurdly sincere and on the nose, faux sophisticated and just as often facile. The entire film can be fairly adequately described as ""the imagination of a kid playing with toys in his room, surrounded by cowboy and spaceman and World War II comics.""

As the series went on, what changed is that the series began to take itself not so much seriously, as self-seriously. You can't go back to the feel of that original Star Wars, any more than you can make a successful sequel to ""Rocky Horror,"" because intentional camp is just kitsch: if it's not completely sincere in an off-kilter way, audiences will know. 

Cultural changes will contribute to this in a way also: the name ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" is obvious cod-Japanese, as is his warrior-monk philosophy, and Yoda's speech, mannerisms and peculiar accent are clearly an attempt at ""inscrutable old Chinaman"" iconography; similar attempts at infusing space opera with Orientalism in the prequels gave us the somewhat racist Trade Federation characters (to say nothing of other international stereotypes like Watto or Jar-Jar Binks)."
"This was a local story for me. I went to high school with Sunil. Reddit didn't just doxx him, they doxxed his whole family. Then the media caught onto the story and terrorized his poor family.

"Bit late to the party, but I've a pretty good one. NSFW, so no young-uns better read this one.

We'd been dating for a few months. I came over to her house and we and are doing the West-Texas two-step (more commonly known as the horizontal Hokey Pokey) when she says ""I love...your cock."" I kind of ignored it, because a) the pause between words was juuust long enough to believe that she did not mean to say I love you, and b) it was pretty damned hot.

Next day, I tell the story to a female friend of mine and she immediately says ""duuuuuuuuuuuuuude. That's not what she meant."" A few nights later my SO and I laying in bed and work up the courage to tell her I Love her and she says it right back.

Then I look at her and say ""you meant to say it the other night, didn't you?"" and she turns bright red ""YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO NOTICE!""

We're well past a year together now. Best decision I've ever made, though I do remind her of that first ""attempt"" at I love you occasionally, just to see her blush."

"Once I got used to the clunky controls this game blew my mind. I was crestfallen when I saw what the series became, but that first installment was amazing for its time.

At one point after becoming a mage (which is a big fucking deal and a huge amount of work) I got banished from the main city. But I had a spell that could turn me into a meatbug (a small isopod). So I made myself tiny and crawled under the cracks of the gate and blithely scuttled right by the guards and NPCs. I then returned to my human form and began spamming Wave of Death and Army of Darkness, murdering the entire fucking city (they are all assholes, trust me). The undead minions were smart enough to use ladders and actually hunt people down, so you had townsfolk running around screaming trying to get away while the city guard tried to beat back the army of undead. And Wave of Death is a weird necromantic spell that passes through walls, so it just snuffed out people hiding in their hovels.

The world just felt real and alive, which was so rare for games back then, and honestly even for games these days. IIRC it came out BEFORE Morrowind and had more/~~better~~ voice acting and a more believable world. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely love Morrowind as it excelled in other areas. But Gothic is a lesser known gem from a less known studio, and it's a bit harder to get into due to clunky controls and slow start to the story."

"You're asking for a pretty specific group of people - lawyers who do criminal law and work as defense attorneys. I work as a prosecutor, so the biggest piece of shit I've ever prosecuted is a happier story than what you're probably looking for, but for the sake of contributing to a currently empty thread:

The biggest piece of shit I prosecuted was a rape case. This guy had seriously hurt a woman that he had had no prior connection with - a relatively rare stranger rape case, with injuries so severe that the victim was lucky to have survived the attack. During arguments it had become clear that this guy - who was shouting out in court, interrupting me and causing a scene, had misrepresented the extent of his crime to his family, who were packing the courtroom in support of this guy. I distinctly got the impression that they had been led to believe by this guy that this had been consensual sex and the victim was just lying about how it had been consensual. 

To make a long story short, when he begun to shout out and interrupt me while I was arguing, I turned to recounting the gory details of the victim's injuries in order to shame him in front of his family. (Argumentatively, I was making a larger point about how he had likely intended to kill her, as evidenced by the severity of the victim's injuries.) After a few minutes of this his family finally lulled into silence, and the defendant begun openly weeping - for what I got the sense was the fact that his family was clearly in this moment learning what a monster this man was. Not to sound cold myself, but obviously this story of how I reduced a rapist to tears in front of his family is one of my go-tos. "

"I'm really late, but me and my girlfriend had a very similar situation happen.

We went to Philadelphia for St. Paddy's day, because my Chicago trip got cancelled.  We went out to this club later in the night to celebrate the holiday.  We had a few drinks (maybe.. 3 each?) and for the last drink we decided to split one because they were expensive.  She goes up to the bar without me, after insisting she didn't need me to come with, and this guy starts hitting on her.  He asks who the drink was for and she says ""Me and my boyfriend"".  To this he responds that he will kill me if she wants him to.  Right after he says this, the bartender sets down a drink, then immediately puts down an identical drink and the guy says ""I don't know who that other one is for honey"" and she grabs the first drink and comes back to me.  We share the drink and as soon as we walk out of the club, we black out for the whole night.  We briefly remember falling in the middle of the road and getting back up to get to the other side, and going to a taco bell.  The next day we wake up not knowing what the hell happened, and we felt awful for the next **week**.  

Fortunately we were with a very good group of friends and made sure we made it back to the apartment with them.  I am 200lb and she is about 140lb.  Thankfully, we shared the drink.  I have no idea what would have happened if she is the only person who drank it."

"Because the economy is quantitatively better? Like, we can prove it with real numbers using science? I thought the facts had a liberal bias?

If you want to decrease the wage gap, raise capital gains taxes. This has also been proven scientifically by the Congressional Budget Office during the Obama administration. We would literally only have to raise capital gains taxes for this to work. In fact, a lot of economists think that lowering capital gains taxes is the sole reason for the growing wealth gap and the death of the middle class. 

Guess who’s fighting to raise capital gains taxes? Nobody. "

"Only played 2, then skipped 3 because of its notorious bugs, but man one of the greatest RPG experiences I’ve ever had. The crazy thing is I almost gave up literally right at the start. The combat mechanics drove me crazy, so wonky and clumbsy. After dying several times I quit and pure laziness prevented me from uninstalling it. Days later I was bored and figured I would give it another try. Made it past the starting area with great frustration. A couple of hours and levels later it dawned on me: the controls are shit by design. It gets better the more you focus on combat.
  
It all just suddenly clicked, and I fucking loved it from that point forward. Such an incredible, open world. No hand holding. Stumble your way into a crypt deep in the woods and you’re in serious shit. So much depth to everything, so much stuff to do, so many options. One of the greatest RPG’s ever made."

"Copy-paste from another reply I made today.

TL;DR at the bottom.

​

I was in the metro, going home. When I reached my station, as usual, I  get down and start to walk towards my place. On my way, I noticed  someone seemed to follow me. I tried to walk a bit faster, him too. It  was the afternoon, bright daylight, a lot of people in the street, so I  was not worried, but still, I wondered who this is and what does he  want.

I reached the building where my apartment is located, and I decided  to wait for him in front of the door, to see what he wanted. He said to  me: ""Excuse me, it's probably going to sound strange, but are you gay?"".  I said yes, and he continued ""I thought so. I saw you in the metro, and  I think you're really cute"". I was quite surprised, I didn't expected  that. 

""Thanks, you too. I live here, do you want to come inside and have a  drink?"", ""With pleasure"". Once in my apartment, I offered him a beer and  took one for myself. We chatted a few minutes, then what had to happen  happened, and we started touching each other. A few seconds later, we  were both naked, and started playing with each other. I'm gonna pass the  details, but we had a lot of fun together.

Before leaving, we exchanged phone numbers. A few days later, he  texted me that he was again coming near my place, and asked if I wanted  to see him again. I said yes, and we did it a second time. After that,  we exchanged a few more text messages, but we couldn't meet again. I  haven't seen him since then.

It looks like a porn scenario, but it actually happened.

​

TL;DR: guy saw me in metro, thought I was cute, followed me to my  place, we had sex, exchanged phone numbers, we did it again a few days  later."

However, he's incorrect when he makes it sound like the U.S. is somehow ""footing the bill."" We contribute a higher percentage of our GDP to defense because we choose to have a massive global military presence. In other words, Spain (for example) agreed to set aside 2% of their GDP for defense. They were setting aside less than 1%. He's right in calling them out on that. BUT, the U.S. is not making up that gap for them. We're not pitching in the money that Spain is withholding because Spain is not withholding it from some big pot of money. They're withholding it from their own military."

I have actually looked at old windows; my house growing up had hand-blown windows, and every church in the area had old stained glass windows.  Yes, they are thicker at the bottom.  No, that isn't because glass is a liquid when cooled.  It's because of the manufacturing process for making hand-made glass windows.

Yes, glass is a solid.  But it has some properties of a liquid, namely that its atoms aren't rigidly ordered and structured like a crystalline solid.  Some plastics are like this.  Rubber.

So no, glass windows aren't flowing downward, but the myth is based in a misunderstanding of a way that they are molecularly similar to a liquid."

If I had to guess, it's because Square Enix doesn't really understand what the fan base actually wants from them. Their response to people losing their shit when they put out that tech demo for FF7 for PS3 was that they made a formal statement that the video was just a demo of what the PS3 could do, and they had no plans whatsoever to remaster FF7 for PS3. And then after years of badgering and complaints from the fan base about it, they announced they were actually going to remake FF7, but everything except the story will be different (ie the combat and gameplay look to be closer to Kingdom Hearts or FF15, instead of the game people actually wanted.)"

"Not a doctor, but a respiratory therapist student that works clinical hospital shifts throughout the week. So I work with a lot of contagious patients.

There are actually a few guidelines to avoid contracting nosocomial(hospital-acquired) infections as best we can! We have a rule where we have to stop when entering a patient’s room to determine what kind of precautions we should take before even coming in contact with the patient. In the case of many diseases, we have specialized masks to wear to avoid certain infections depending on the type of transmission- droplet transmission(example: the flu) requires a simple surgical mask and more dangerous airborne transmission(example: tuberculosis) require much stronger (N-95) masks. We also have other protective equipment(such as gloves. so many gloves!) and wash our hands frequently(at least 15 seconds!).
More often than not, though, it’s just a case of distance. Most common diseases are spread by droplets, and can only travel about 3 feet from the sick person. Just respecting a patient’s personal space keeps us within a safe distance. We’re also always up to date on vaccinations so we’re immune to most of the severe infections. 

Precautions don’t always save us, though, and we do sometimes get sick. We’re kind of like cats, though- it’s hard to tell! It’s much safer to not give patients anything to worry about. We know how to keep ourselves from infecting our patients."

"Sir Humphry made a bit of a mess of naming this new element, at first spelling it alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum, and finally settling on aluminium in 1812. His classically educated scientific colleagues preferred aluminium right from the start, because it had more of a classical ring, and chimed harmoniously with many other elements whose names ended in –ium, like potassium, sodium, and magnesium, all of which had been named by Davy.

The spelling in –um continued in occasional use in Britain for a while, though that in –ium soon predominated. In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Webster’s Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum, though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the nineteenth century was aluminium; it was the preferred version in The Century Dictionary of 1889 and is the only spelling given in the Webster Unabridged Dictionary of 1913. Searches in an archive of American newspapers show a most interesting shift. Up to the 1890s, both spellings appear in rough parity, though with the –ium version slightly the more common, but after about 1895 that reverses quite substantially, with the decade starting in 1900 having the –um spelling about twice as common as the alternative; in the following decade the –ium spelling crashes to a few hundred compared to half a million examples of –um.

"&gt;But I guess I find it weird that so many people have shifted to casual relationships being the default..

All relationships are casual by default until such time as the couple talks about cementing the relationship into a serious coupling.  It's always been pretty much this way (outside of arranged coupling, which is an altogether different topic).

Even back when my parents were young and one would ask the other to ""go steady.""  That, even then, was their way of solidifying I'm *your* boy/girl friend and you're *mine* to the exclusion of all others.  That made what had been casual to that point, official.

While the words used may have changed with time, this conversation must happen.  You must tell your partner what you want/expect and then listen when they tell you what they want/expect.  Until then, nobody has the right to just assume their love interest feels the same way or wants the same things.  This is regardless of how much time you've spent together.

If you don't have this conversation and then you find out they've been seeing other people then that's on you.  It's not on them for not knowing what you failed to communicate.

Noone is to blame but myself."
Alcohol lowers inhibitions - it doesn’t make you do things that you hadn’t considered doing sober and stopped yourself. So the first question is have to have an answer to would be what was wrong with our relationship that such a thing would happen.
"&gt;I got a promotion taking over someone else's job after they left three months ago. No one has come to fill my old position yet so I'm still doing it alongside my new job. I also haven't gotten my pay raise that comes with my promotion yet. It's infuriating and there's nothing my boss can do about it because it's up to upper management and until my position is filled, I'm in it and the other position remains empty.

Talk to boss. Tell him he has a choice.

He either chooses between getting your shit sorted, pay backdated and the position backfilled with a contractor while they hire. 

Or you carry on doing your old job on your old salary while looking for a new job. 

Or carry on doing what you're doing, stress yourself out and go off sick from the inevitable pressure.

"This is something I wish everyone would understand. Introverts can be social. Extroverts can be averse to socializing. The difference is if socializing energizes or drains you.

The best way to make progress is always outside of your comfort zone. When you're comfortable you stagnate and never move forward. So just take it slow and be ready to take up the challenge. No need to jump into the deep end of the pool straight out though.
One thing I learned that definitely helps reduce stress and make so many problems easier to tackle is that you're not in control of everything. There's no point in stressing about things you can do nothing about. 
"Think about what you've said. It's clear you've never actually listened to Gavin Mcinnes because 1) You'd know that idea of him being a White Supremacist is absurd and 2) You associate listening to what he says with feelings of shame. That's batshit irrational.  

How naive do you have to be to crave peer approval so much that if somebody told you Scooby Doo was a ""literal White Supremacist"" you would instantly capitulate to the approved groupthink and never watch an episode of Scooby Doo? (and weirdly, feel SHAME if you did) You're also telling other people that they should feel shame if they watch Scooby Doo despite the fact you've never watched Scooby Doo.

I'd be interested to know how you would feel if you dared to form your own opinion and listen for yourself instead of taking a prepacked opinion off the shelf from your peers and steadfastly pretending it's your own. 

Would you feel that you'd been lied to or had something misrepresented to you? Would you be angry with the people who gave you your opinion if it turned out they had been deliberately dishonest to you to manipulate what you listen to? 

I guess you'll never know, cos you're too afraid of feelings of shame and clinging on to your peer approval to even check. "

Turns out the first doc misdiagnosed a nasty viral infection and all the meds he was one was what was keeping him sick-he basically had the digestive system of a five year old. Weaned him off the meds, gave him dietary support and he healed up pretty quick.

I guess I'm saying: seeing another doc that specializes in GI issues might be a good idea if you haven't done so already."

I use this quote from time to time when the situation presents itself. No one ever gets it. 
"Favorite Scary movie, the minimal score is so intensifying."
"The more hardcore fans or at least those who watch frequently will tell you that it can be very frustrating at times and a bit of a slog, it often feels like they don't give the fans what they want to see, but people usually stick around anyway. People who don't understand see it as silly and fake, but we don't watch it thinking that it's all real. We know the results are pre-determined, and that measures are taken to reduce pain and risk of injury, but it still hurts like hell for those involved. Honestly not many people could put their bodies through what these people do multiple times a week, every week, all year, every year. What keeps people into it varies from person to person. Some enjoy seeing the technical ability of wrestlers, others the productions itself. I personally enjoy it for the storytelling, and the enjoyment of being presented with some very talented people being able to showcase what they're good at draws me in and keeps me entertained constantly. It's just one of those things, people don't understand why adults would watch until you know a bit about it."

How will this decision help me in 5 days? How will it help me in 5 months? And how will it help me in 5 years?

Hopefully this is applicable :)"

Anyways the best part is the lady, who was probably 50 years old, let out a loud ""What the fuuuuuuuuuck!?!?"" In an accent that had me looking around to find the 19 year old valley girl.

"I actually know this firsthand because I used to be allergic to gluten(nothing serious, I would just get sick if I ate it), and I first had to stop eating it when there was absolutely nothing out there for me. My mom would make bread from scratch every other week. Once I had a birthday just after Bliss Cupcakes started having a gluten free option, and my mom bought gluten free cupcakes for my whole party. Everyone says they were awful, and they probably were. But all I remember is that after 2 or 3 years I finally had a cake that wasn't homemade and I ate the whole thing. So yeah I'm very thankful for the large amount of gluten free options nowadays, but it is so dumb when people think gluten is unhealthy. It's like no one remembers the food pyramids from grade school that had bread on them"

"Reading these are interesting to me. I grew up in San Francisco and was in high school in the late 90s and early 00s. During this time in one of the most gay friendly places in the world some of the things that I look back on seem so backwards. 

I went to a high school of around 2k kids and there was only two openly gay kids I can think of. Using the word gay as a negative word was still fairly acceptable and used often. I went to a GSA meeting and there were only ten kids who went. After I went everyone assumed I was gay and started making fun of me. Almost every year I’ve worked as an adult I march in the pride parade with my employers contingent and no one now says anything. 

The thing that stands out for me is one of the openly gay boys ran for prom queen and everyone voted for him because they thought it was funny. When he won the prom king stormed off and everyone laughed. 

I can’t imagine any of this happening now and I wonder what the kids who go to that same high school will think of the state of society now when they look back 20 years from now. "

&amp;#x200B;

I can join a shooting federation, that would allow me to easily get a riffle (not sure how it works, but I guess there must some training before I'm allow to keep it). Hunting is also quite popular, so becoming one (requires a permit) should allow to get a hunting riffle easily.

But the easiest way is if you do your military service. You receive a semi-automatic assault riffle at the beginning (for some, it will be a pistol), you can keep it at home as long as you stay incorporated in the army (until 30 years old), then you have to give back all your military belongings, but you have the option to buy the riffle. If you do it, it will be modified to disable burst shooting. Of course, this method only works if you have the Swiss nationality.

Otherwise, I don't know. No idea how easy it is to get a pistol or simply buy a weapon that is not for hunting or range shooting. I'm pretty sure you need a permit for all hand weapons, no idea how easy it is to get one."

"This was a nightmare....

I was at Disneyland with my family, inc my youngest son who is autistic. He has a speech delay, but is otherwise intelligent. The biggest thing is he has a few phobias, one of which is (for some reason) auto flush toilets. 

Now, there are 3 family bathrooms in DL with non auto toilets, but he HAD to go and the closest one was occupied. So I took him into he regular one. 

Got him in the stall and tried to get him to go, covering the sensor to try to convince him. He starts screaming “No No don’t make me don’t make me! I don’t want it!” At the top of his lungs. 

After about 2 min of this he has an accident and starts crying. That’s when suddenly the door is pounded on hard enough it buckled and security is standing there with a cop

Someone thought i was molesting a kid in the bathroom. 

Got taken to the security office while my wife was frantically trying to explain to them what was going on, was almost put under arrest until my wife got him to talk enough for them to understand. "

Why not just use the allegation as a political stunt and hold off as long as possible until literally the moment it looks like he is about to be confirmed to try and push it till after the midterms where she could have the power to tell Trump to fuck off. Feinstein doesn't give a shit about sexual assault or Ford. If she did, she wouldn't have screwed over actual assault victims by using an allegation to her own benefit as a political stunt."

 Also, kids are expensive. What if they have some horrible disease or are incapable of ever taking care of themselves as an adult?

"The worst I ever had with them was I changed apartments in the same complex. Got multiple confirmations they switched everything over to the new apartment. 
Some of their systems didn't line up - they moved the billable hours from old to the new but not the billing address itself. So after a few weeks, my power goes off since they still sent the bill to the old address. 
None of this sounded weird to the CSR when I called in. Explain slowly, and they still don't see the issue. This was 03 so they weren't fully online so I couldn't go on there to fix it.

I know that is a terrible way to put it, but the books have certaim events that occur and you whole heartedly believe they happened a certain way. Hundreds of pages later you may find out the truth, but in the show it always seems like the next scene.

And stormy daniels is in some strip club slanging wears to make money.

And tucker then asked avenatti about this and avenatti calously said ""she wants to be working in strip clubs""

"The official term for this in the field of evolutionary psychology is ""Costly Signaling"".

The most obvious example of this in nature is the peacocks tail.

Basically wearing something so over the top that it would hurt your ability to hunt. You are signalling that you are such a good hunter than you can still make the kill even while wearing ridiculous colors. So you become even more attractive to potential mates than the others who need to wear camo.

The 30 inche JNCOs are a just one of a million ways that humans might engage in costly signalling.

The jeans are so utterly impractical that they are actually a burden to wear, but they are such a strong signal to potential mates that she will still wear them with pleasure.

Other examples of this might be excessive jewelry, like on a rapper, excessive tattoos, huge breast implants and other peacock tail type of stuff."

"Well my first step would be to check for any traps.  After I have confirmed this is not a trap of any sort I would grab the chips and open the bag.  Once the bag was open I would see there are exactly three chips in it.  I would make an animal trap and use one for bait, use another for the kindling of a fire, and save the last one for emergencies.


So, once I have my fire going I go and check my animal trap to see I have caught a rabbit.  After I gut it, I put it on a stick and roast it over the fire.  As it's cooking I go to look for more firewood, and while doing so I come across a strange bottle.  I pick it up and instantly a genie pops out of it.  He tells me he will grant me one wish in exchange for my last potato chip.  I think about it for a while, before respectfully declining, thinking I could have use for it later.


Later that night I'm awoken by a noise not too far from where I'm sleeping.  I grab a stick off the ground and start moving towards it. It's hard to see since all I have is the light from the little fire, but I am able to make out the shape of a humanoid creature.  All of a sudden a deep voice bellows ""give me the chip"".  I tell him it's mine, and he lunges at me.  I smack the creature with my stick and begin running.  I can't see where I'm going, but I just keep running.  I can hear his footsteps gaining on me, and just as I look behind me, I slam into a tree.


I awaken in the beast's lair.  I can now see that he is a large, green troll looking creature.  He's hunched over me, obviously waiting for me to awaken.  ""Give me the chip,"" he repeats.  I tell him I won't, so he stands up and begins walking towards a table in the corner of his lair.  I see him pick up a large knife and I decide I need to make a run for it.  While he's bent over the table examining his knife, I quietly slip out of his cave and begin running.  I hear him let out a roar from his cave and he begins to run after me.  It's morning now, so I can see where I'm going.  As I run, I begin to hear something.  It sounds almost like a helicopter of some sort...

I look up into the sky and see a military helicopter gliding through the air.  I just make it into a clearing and begin to flag the chopper down.  I can hear the beast trampling through the woods towards me.  Then, just as he reaches the clearing, the chopper opens fire on him and he slumps to the ground, dead.

Once they pick me up they start questioning me.  Once I tell them my story they explain that they've been hunting the beast for weeks and thank me for what I did.  Just as we begin to take off, I remember the chip.  I whip it out of my pocket and pop it into my mouth.  I spit it out almost instantly.  It was one of those black burnt chips you get at the bottom of the bag.  I stair at the soggy chip in my palm, pondering the events that just unfolded.

"""Hey Reddit, what do you think of &lt;insert change to accommodate popular opinion here&gt;?""

ex. forcing drivers to use turn signals, removing sirens from music, etc.

They get a shit ton of upvotes because it's a popular opinion. The chance of an Askreddit thread actually causing change on that scale is probably pretty slim, so it's just a place for people to vent on the issue. Not really many insightful answers there."

"I’m a headhunter and was once working an assignment to find a highly specialized type of pipeline integrity engineer for one of my clients. There are very few in Canada that fit the requirements they had given us in terms of technical and leadership ability.


After much searching, I found a guy who was absolutely *perfect*, and open to considering a new opportunity. He was very well qualified and not asking for an unreasonable increase in money. He was the perfect candidate, a slam dunk who would undoubtedly land me a fat commission if all went well.


Finally, just before I would have proceeded to submit him to my client, I asked him if he had any questions and he said:


“Yes, just one: will my supervisor be female? I won’t work under a woman.”

"It doesn't matter if it was the Russian government or not. Besides, we already know about the Russian government's connections through the Guccifer 2.0 account. 

Point is, they went to a meeting to get stolen information on a candidate. And they lied about it. A ton of people have been indicted. We also know for a fact that the Russian government interfered with the election to help Trump. And that Trump was in talks with them to build a Trump Tower Moscow. And that he and his staff have lied a whole bunch of times about it. 

Of course a ton of the evidence is not available to the public but just the circumstantial evidence alone is enough to know. 

&gt;“There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, according to a recording of the June 15, 2016, exchange, which was listened to and verified by The Washington Post. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is a Californian Republican known in Congress as a fervent defender of Putin and Russia.

&gt;House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) immediately interjected, stopping the conversation from further exploring McCarthy’s assertion, and swore the Republicans present to secrecy.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-majority-leader-to-colleagues-in-2016-i-think-putin-pays-trump/2017/05/17/515f6f8a-3aff-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html?utm_term=.d8635aa853b9

Trump claimed that he and nobody working for him had any business with Russia. Now we've seen that pretty much every single person working for him was also *extremely* busy working for Russia, most of them while they were on Trump's campaign staff. 

Here's Trump Jr. meeting with one of Putin's top oligarchs, the deputy governor of Russia's central bank: https://themoscowproject.org/collusion/trump-jr-meets-kremlin-linked-banker-nra-convention/

He also said “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets... we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia” just a bit before Trump said that he had ""nothing to do with Russia."" But there's an entire wiki page dedicated to Trump's businesses in Russia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia

Obama fired Flynn and warned Trump that he was a Russian asset. Trump ignored that and hired him anyway. 

Then there's the fact that Trump asked Russia for ""help"" finding Hillary's lost emails, on national television. And guess what, Russia complied *that very same day*: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/trump-russia-clinton-emails.html

And claiming things like this are a joke doesn't make one innocent in the eyes of the US legal system. Winks and nods aren't loopholes. 

Just the fact that Trump has lied and hidden evidence and the GOP has worked to block all investigation into it is enough for anyone to see that he's dirty. There are more than enough crimes that we have already proven that he should be impeached and removed from office. The GOP just won't do it because they are complicit. There's plenty of proof of that, too. 

And I didn't even mention Trump's crimes from before he was running for office - the money laundering and sexual assaults and other various illegal and disgusting acts. 

Do you work this hard to insist that Hillary is innocent, too? "

"If you're baking cookies or something you should do all your fats &amp; sugars first (butter, peanut butter, white sugar, brown sugar), then your eggs, follow that with any extracts (vanilla, almond, whatever), from there you should mix all your dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. I like to add my dry ingredients in thirds, so as not to overwhelm the wet ingredients and give it a chance to fully incorporate. Try not to over mix your dry ingredients, once it's mixed, stop mixing. Also, letting cookie dough set in the fridge or freezer overnight will give you a more melded, complex flavor vs. baking right away. "

"No, the story of the Trojan war as recorded in the Iliad did not happen. 

However there are real events that inspired it. There is a real city of Troy, and what is more there are Hittite records of an independent city large enough to make treaties with the Hittite Empire and Egypt in the general area of where Troy was found, called Wilusa in the Hittite records, which is pretty close to the name Ilios, the other name of Troy. The Hittites even record that there was conflict in that area by the Ahhiyawans, which links up with the Greek as Homer makes a definitive point to call the Greeks in the Iliad the Achaeans.

Excavation of the city has shown that at least one layer was burnt to the ground in a war. But to get back to the Trojan horse, the horse was an animal that was linked to Poseidon, the god of the sea. You know what else he is the god of? Earthquake. And one layer of Troy was destroyed by a massive earthquake.

So while it did necessarily happen, there were plenty of real events that inspired the story."

"I have a chinese tourist anecdote. I had been visiting a castle in the countryside, and was waiting at the bus stop to return home. Mind you, this is an off-season countryside bus stop: there was literally nobody in sight for miles in both directions, just woods and scenery, the bus stop pole, and me. Then suddenly from afar this woman appears, walking quickly, she approaches quickly, and then proceeds to VIOLENTLY PUSH ME ASIDE TO GET IN FRONT OF ME, next to the bus stop pole. She wanted to be first! I was so astounded I couldn't say anything. Funny thing is, the bus arrived 20 mins later and we were still the only two people there.

"Never forget that the success stories are the ones you're more likely to hear. It may seem like everyone else is somehow more successful or happy or what have you, but you're much much less likely to hear the stories from the people in the same boat as you unless you personally know them. All the time, I feel like I should somehow be more successful for my age, but it's because no matter where I look, the only stories I see are the ones of people succeeding, because no one's going around talking about all their failures except the really really successful people who I couldn't relate to anyway. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward. It helps me to imagine whatever is holding me back as a person who is trying to talk me out of living my life to its fullest because they're jealous and just imagining telling them, ""Fuck you, this is my life.

&gt;There a super small portion of people who love what they do, and that's awesome.

I'm one of those lucky people.

My job isn't perfect, but most of the time it doesn't even feel like I'm working. Yesterday dragged a little and I clock watched a bit from 2pm for about an hour, but most of the time it literally doesn't feel like I've done a day's work. And these idiots are paying me for it. Suckers.

I've turned down *several* promotion opportunities due to knowing that  I wouldn't enjoy the new job as much. I had one guy practically beg me to join his department and offer me at least an extra 20% and car or relocation costs. Even offered to just build an office near to my home just to get me working for him (currently I work at home the vast majority of the time). It was bloody tempting, but I knew I'd not enjoy the newer role nearly as much as this one.

It's not perfect, sometimes longer hours that I'd like (Tuesday will be 12 hours and a somewhat early start to the day, for example) and sometimes a little stressful, but thems the breaks.

I have a mortgage, two cars on the drive, frequent holidays, save roughly 40% every month. Although the money situation is largely due to just living within my means, my income is very much average for my country.

I've hit the jackpot and I fucking love it.

But... I had to go through a lot of bullshit jobs, crap bosses, crap hours, crap pay to get here. And I was so hopelessly bored in my previous role. I was very lucky to get this new job (in the same company) as I'm under qualified for it on paper. Someone just mentioned my name in conversation and here I am. I didn't even know the role existed until I got a phone call from an old boss.

Maybe I'm lucky, maybe at some point my luck will run out. But for now it's awesome.

Other than bragging, what I'm saying is that it's perfectly possible to love your job, and it can just come from nowhere, just be ready for when it does. 

Don't give up."

I thought, ""well, I can easily get a minimum-wage job while I job search."" However, I learned that living on the Mexican border makes it very difficult to get a customer service job without good Spanish skills. It also did not help that the town I was in had 30% unemployment at the time (was told it was highest in the nation), so there was a very wide pool of people competing for each minimum-wage job. My wife and I were able to get little temp jobs, like packing holiday baskets for a bakery at Christmas time, and I was able to do yard work for a doctor, but the main thing that carried us through was some short-term but lucrative consulting work that was within my specialty.  I have all kinds of stress from my current job, but I certainly learned that ANY job is better than NO job. Life takes some very twisty paths."

2. Immediately transfer the amount into my savings account with 1.5% return.  Never ever touch it again.
3. If it's still there, that's $832,000 interest earned each month, which I will use.
4. Create a trust fund for me and my family that gives monthly payouts of 1/2 interest returned.
5. Split further monthly interest from the billion between bitcoin (so it can't be touched) and building up the trust fund until the trust-fund payout makes for a comfortable living.
6. Find a nice country with non-extradition and buy a place.
7. When the bank discovers their error (if not in the first couple of days, best guess is about 18-24 months), hire a team of fancy lawyers with the trust fund money to claim that the interest accrued during my time holding the funds is legally mine, and they're welcome to their billion back.
8. Move to non-extradition property until it's all over.
9. If the trust is loss, use the bitcoin to restart the trust fund in new country
10. Live happily ever after, on a comfortable budget.

I've been outed without permission before, and it's super violating to have that control taken away. Living, it's a safety thing, dead it's taking away how you (apparently) want to be remembered. Especially living in a very homophobic place, the podcast changed a lot of opinion about him, I'm sure."

"I've been sick for a year, seen multiple doctors, no one knows what it is. I've got nausea 24/7, to the point I'm usually dry-heaving into a car sick bag, I have intense back and jaw pain all the time, constant headaches and a host of other symptoms. Doctors currently think it's tmd/tmj, I'm getting an MRI and X-ray done in a fortnight. At this stage I don't care what it is, I can't keep living like this and I need an answer. The only thing keeping me going is my amazingly supportive partner and his family."

My nicotine is now 1/4 of what I started with, and I can go for hours without vaping. I've been mixing my own liquid for several years, total cost is around $20/month.

My son started smoking in college (sketch gf), he tried quitting many times but kept relapsing. I bought him a vape kit one Xmas, which he finally tried after a few months. He got off cigs, vaped for a year or so, then quit that, too. He's been smoke/vape free for several years now."

"All of the people that I know that seem to be happy with their lives seem to have a very obvious and intense meaning to their lives. Family, work, hobbies, music, money, attention, whatever, they basically live for it.

I don't think I have something like that for myself, and I don't think I'd even know what it was. I do have somethings that make me somewhat happy to the point where I forget about my problems, the world and all of its terrible characteristics - you know, violence, inequality, politics and so on -.

I'm not gonna claim I know how to acquire something like this, this sort of *reason d'etrê*, but I think that once you find it for yourself, and you have the means to get close to it or have it completely, you'll feel less pain, less anxiety, less depression. I don't think it'll go away, but it'll at least be manageable. "
"I'm probably going to come across as an asshole here, but I feel like I need to share something with you, op.

So years ago I was like that too. I had a circle of friends who consisted of a few people like that. People who constantly needed to unload their crap on anyone around them. And usually I was ok to be that person. But it got to the point where their baggage was taking up so much of my time and energy. If they were having a bad week I would be at their house or if they needed to talk I'd be completely focused on our conversation. At some point you start to realize that you're not talking to a friend anymore, you're just being someone's enabler. You start to enable that person to constantly make the same mistakes, to not have to get a grasp on their emotions, and to not have to face their problems head on. You become that excuse to not have to face the tribulations of life. Unfortunately, some people are just like that. Even if you cut them off they would just find someone else to enable them. Some people just can't confront their issues. 

Also unfortunately, I have since lost those friends who were like that. I found it only took a few times of saying ""Look, I really need to focus on my stuff right now. I don't know what to tell you."" for the calls to stop, and then you stop hanging out, and then one day you see you're not even friends on Facebook anymore. And you wonder if you were ever really friends to begin with.

I'm not saying to not be there for the people in your life, but I am saying that sometimes you need to just let people solve their own problems and take care of yourself."
"I don't even know. I'm 22, still live with my mom and don't have much work experience apart from the 4-5 months I worked as a mailman. I'm studying for a Bachelor's in a field I have no interest in (electrical engineering). I want to work in IT because that's what I'm interested in and is something I'd like to think I'm good at (a lot better than the average person, anyway), but most places still require a degree, and I really don't feel like studying is my thing. Most of it is just useless theoretical crap. What the fuck does the average sysadmin/programmer/support person/whatever need differential calculus or electromagnetism or mechanics for?

I dunno, I just have this feeling that I'll spend most or all of my life unemployed or working a boring minimum wage job."

"Many middle class and (especially) wealthy people have money to invest. They can invest in stocks, bonds,  real estate, their own business venture, etc. They just want to make more money with the money that have piled up.

The US economy has been slowly growing since the recession, but it’s been pretty tepid at 2%.  Because it’s been slow to grow, the Fed has kept interest rates LOW to make borrowing money easier for people and businesses. The idea being that more loans means more business transactions that are good for the economy. 

But low interest rates effect both loans AND interest rates on things like savings accounts and bonds. So a low interest rate means crappy interest gains by most investing standards except for the Stock market. This is why the stock market has had 7 years of continual growth with minimal fluctuations or uncertainty. It’s the best return on investment since other forms of investments are far less lucrative. Unfortunately this has resulted in an unequal investment between different markets, resulting in an overvalued stock market and undervalued bond market. 

There are certainly a lot of negative things going on in the country, but economically for big money (the uber wealthy and large corporations), they’re very happy about the tax cuts and deregulation that this administration has passed. These large entities are optimistic about the economy, and they’re investing more of their money into the stock market, infrastructure, and growing their business. These things then get noticed by investors, who then believe the stocks of these companies to be good investments, with the idea that these companies will grow in the next year or years. More people and companies buying a stock means the value of that stock goes up.

The main concerns regarding the economy include (1) no real tax break for middle class and poor Americans, (2) persistent wage stagnation despite economic growth and increased concentration of money to the elite, (3) no good viable solutions for healthcare with this Congress, and (4) how tariffs will likely fasten the pace of inflation and make many things much more expensive.

"Absolutely adore this series. It doesn't just have incredibly engaging gameplay with a lot of fun side elements like cooking, equipment modification, and books both fiction and non-fiction, the story is phenomenal. You'll sink a lot of hours into this series, and in my opinion very little is filler. They have several previous games' worth of lore to utilise and build upon, and a huge world that'll make you feel immersed at all times.

The characters are all pretty interesting. A lot of them start off looking pretty in tune with common archetypes; Laura is a calm, composed nobleman's daughter and heir to her family's school of swordsmanship, Fie is a silent, stoic, girl who isn't all that intimidating visually, but happens to start the game with more combat skill than 90% of the playable cast. Jusis is an acid-tongued noble who rather coldly rebuffs most early attempts at friendship but warms up over time. These archetypes are then deconstructed throughout the games in very interesting ways I won't spoil here.

Overall though, what I really love about the games is they have heart. Time is spent on building relationships and dynamics between characters. They have conflicts and resolutions, highs and lows, and at the end of the day they're constantly and openly supporting one another. There's teasing and jokes, but for the most part it lacks the recent Dragon Age-esque trend of ""They say absolutely vile things to one another but we promise you they're friends really,"" which is really refreshing. I can't recommend these games enough."

After a day in the hospital on antibiotics, and me responding to them, they realized that it wasn't whatever crazy infection they initially almost called CDC over. The shit was nasty though. Turned out to be some water-borne bacteria. Somehow water got into my dressings. Basically my wound was molding and my leg was rotting around it. "

"Let me first preface this by admitting that I think of myself as basically 95% atheist and 5% agnostic.

Having said that (assuming you're still here), I actually think Jesus Christ's philosophy (apart from the whole god thing) was actually a pretty decent way to live and function in the world, especially when dealing with other people who want and deserve to live and function as well.

I tend to paraphrase that particular philosophy as ""respect everyone and don't be a dick"".

"If one really has the will for it and want to change, they can do it.

Books can help when it comes to recognizing one's mistakes and rectifying it. Also changing how one reacts to a situation. I have caught myself stopping how I react in the midst of a mood change. I have also given myself time before I reacted (when I can, such as for discussing issues online - I try not to respond while in a volatile mood because it can be counter-productive).

I have also recently sought out deep breathing exercises, which can help alleviate stress and give other health benefits. I looked on youtube for belly breathing exercises, which includes your whole torso when it comes to deep breathing.

And as others have said, it does help to find a therapist because talking it out and getting guidance can be liberating. There is no shame in seeking out help from a therapist, they are there to help people.

Also as I mentioned earlier, youtube is an invaluable resource. There are tips on how to control different emotions and there are guides on how to do various things, all for free.

It does take practice, discipline, will, and conditioning to break habits. As long as one is consistent in trying to change, it will happen. It takes time and patience."

"Two months ago, I was masturbating, and I  gripped a little too hard, which started some sort of pinching pain on one side of my penis shaft. Since then my days have been hell.

Along with the pain, I realised I am not getting erections as well as before and it just doesn't get hard enough now for me, unless I stroke it. Although the pain did go away almost completely, I have been noticing a gradual bending towards one side when semi erect. It doesn't naturally go beyond semi erect and I have to physically stroke it get a complete erection, which does seem to have a curve. Even on watching erotic content, it fails to go beyond semi erect. 

I am a 22 year old virgin ,who has  never been in a relationship with any woman. This thing with my penis has taken an absolute toll on the little self esteem I had prior to this. Sometimes, I feel suicidal and question my own existence. I ask myself, what even can I do now? I have never had the chance to be with women and I might never get a chance, ever. It bothers me at almost every point in my day, every day of my life. I am far less motivated to do seemingly normal tasks in life, including my work, since my thoughts are entirely about how I am incapable of ever having relationships / sex and suicidal thoughts. I'm in quite a mess that I'm entirely responsible for. "

"My school was originally k-8, but they added on a grade each year until it was also a high school. The first graduating class was in 2007 and we didn’t have a big enough indoor space, so the graduation ceremony was held on our newly renovated football field. I was in the band, and we had a set up of music stands and chairs in semi circles on the field in front of the stands. We entered from the left side of the setup, but I sat on the farthest chair all the way on the right of the semi circle. It was really windy and some of the music stands had fallen over. I was leading my row and I got about halfway to my seat when I tripped over one of the fallen music stands, knocked over the few that were still standing, and fell into some chairs and knocked them over too. The band was to start the ceremony, so all eyes were on us at that time. It just so happened that I was the first person in the front row facing the audience.

I think everyone is different, my future sister in law just got proposed to on the couch at home while some people want to propose on the big screen at a ball park. I'd say just go w the proposal that feels right. I think what I've planned isn't over the top but it'll hopefully be special and memorable enough. And we don't give a shit about gender roles. So he cooks, I propose. "

"I've been a victim of a divorce proceeding where my ex-wife managed to run off with almost 2,000 dollars a month in alimony and child care bills while she finished school. I also got slammed with the new car we bought together because she couldn't afford the payments even though she was the primary loan holder. I was also forced to give her my paid off car at the time. She sold in a few months after the paperwork was final because she claimed that she didn't know how to drive a manual transmission so in the end a large chunk of that child support went to her new car loan even though I gave her a perfectly good automobile. I also got the 9,000 dollars in debt that she and I accumulated from life in general all so I could get bi-weekly time with my son.   


She was an physically and mentally abusive individual and I wanted out after 4 years. People always ask me ""Why didn't you call the cops?"" Well, who are they going to believe? A 6 foot 150 pound male or the 5 foot 115 pound female screaming her head off that I did the abusing? When my son was born we would get in a small argument and it would escalate in to full on threat that she was going to attempt suicide with pills and try and take him from the house in the middle of the night. We would argue and if I said something to defend myself I would get slapped or hit. When she would try and tear off in the middle of the night I would stop her from going in to my son's room to take him and she would then threaten to call the cops because I was making sure that she could not enter. No punches, slaps or any abuse happened when I would pick her up and move her away to deescalate the situation.  The frustrating thing is all I want is equality and when I hear things about ""toxic masculinity"" or how men are all dogs it drives me up the wall. We literally have ZERO ways to get help in situations like this and are guilty until proven innocent. I know feminists are going to lose their shit over what I'm saying because they have it worse and you are right but that's not my argument. No one is denying that you or any other women have been brutally assaulted by men all over the world and that has to change. All I'm asking for is a little remorse for men who do try hard and who do their duty as fathers but failed as husbands because their significant other was as horrifying as your definition of what men are. Mean, cruel sexual monsters. Even if you don't like hearing it, women do that as well. Feminism used to be about equality but as of late I have seen horrid false accusations and the totalitarian push that ALL men have some deep rooted need to rape, beat, or abuse and that just isn't the case.   


Ultimately women need to understand that for every ass hole that can't pay their 100 dollars in support because they beat their spouse there are thousands of hard working, caring men who are getting their ass handed to them in court just because they have a penis and I have yet to meet a woman who truly understands that. I have done nothing wrong but the divorce paperwork makes it look like I did and that truly is a sad sad state of affairs for everyone involved. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. I feel obligated to agree that men are legitimately scared to talk to women now. Not because we have this deep rooted ape like instinct to stick it in everything that moves but because of examples like my case where the thought of me forces someone to think I'm violent for no reasons aside from the fact that I associate myself as male and I am punished because of it.

Somehow it made the whole mess decks laugh in unison when a guy who was way too proud of his farts called out, ""Smell that bouquet"" and I answered, ""Oh put a cork up your butt."" Maybe because I usually minded my manners and he outranked me.

&gt;Through his actions, Stain ends up justifying the need for heroes.

Because he WANTS HEROES.

&gt;false or not

Uh, no. You're using YOUR logic and ignoring Stain's logic. In Stain's eyes the false heroes are in it for themselves. He sees them as cowards. It's easy to see through that lens and imagine it making false heroes quit. He literally does not consider them heroes. He does not see himself as killing heroes.

Again, you're literally ignoring what Stain's point of view actually is. This is something HE SAYS in the show. It's not an interpretation, he literally tells you that that's what his logic is, and yet you continuously substitute a different line of logic and are surprised when it doesn't fit.

Again, Stain is *not* correct. That doesn't make him a bad character. He doesn't have to be a perfect idealogue to be a good character. If anything that would make him a boring character and would make the show more boring garbage.

The fact that he exists in a gray area, as a black and white character is a great juxtaposition. He introduces incredibly cutting and accurate criticisms of the hero world, while being completely wrong in his actions. You seem to think that the series doesn't know this, but it's literally the entire point of his character.

&gt;I won't care what type of hero saves me (selfish or selfless) all I'm going to care about is being saved.

This is completely irrelevant? Whether heroes are saving you from villains or solely from natural disasters you're never going to care about this. Stain is attacking the HEROES not the CIVILIANS because he knows he can never change the civilians opinion, even though that would be the ideal. This has already been covered and is directly mentioned in the show.

&gt;Why would I choose to risk my life fighting villains like Stain if there aren't any rewards or benefits to it?

You wouldn't...unless you were driven by a primal need to help. Ie, were an actual hero. That's literally what he wants. Heroes not driven by greed.

&gt;But those true heroes will instantly become disadvantaged.

Why would they? Heroes have never had an issue with dealing with villains before the timeline of the show. It's again directly mentioned that there are in fact too many heroes. That's actually brought up a lot. It's the reason getting into UA is so important, because without going to one of the top 2 schools (UA or Shiketsu) becoming a top pro is literally impossible and even getting a career is difficult.

Oversaturation of heroes is one of the core issues that enforces and causes the degradation of herosim in HeroAca. I swear it's like you didn't even watch the show. Nothing I've brought up so far is something picked up by context, it's literally all directly spelled out by characters, often repeatedly.

&gt;Stain's flaws ultimately boil down to the fact that he chose to be a murderer. You cannot claim to be an advocate of true heroism and at the same time be a villain who kills heros. It just doesn't make sense.

Because he's NOT KILLING HEROES. HOLY SHIT. How many times does it have to come back to this?

If they get the rights to a new ‘big bad’ who can carry a story arc spanning multiple Phases like Galactus, Doom or Magneto then they could keep the hype alive. But I feel like it could potentially be too late by the time they reach that point.

"Congratulations with Chris D'Elia

It's just a stream of consciousness podcast where Chris just talks about whatever is on his mind. The great thing about it is Chris treats it kinda like a stand up set where he talks about whatever, but in a way that makes it funny.

I would compare it to Bill Burr's podcast, but I feel like Bill is just talking instead of talking for the purpose of making people laugh – Bill just complains.

Anyways, check it out if you're a true baby."

"Honestly it was more what his presidency represented than what it did. Obamacare aside, his policies were pretty mild and moderate (even Obamacare was a compromise of sorts). However he championed the ideas of progressive values, including a government that was socially responsible for its citizens well-being, avowed affirmation of multiculturalism, and a move toward more liberal cultural sensibilities. His symbolism was always more potent than his policy, and that's what really angered people imo."

"See that's what I'm not understanding; why you put 1 single ""ask"" on a pedestal all by itself and none of the other things I mentioned. I'm trying to suggest that your outlook is a little wrong, immature perhaps.

Keep in mind this is just a cultural thing. I know of many people (even distant family) where the man and woman just ended up discussing it at one point without either of them even thinking about bringing it up at a special occasion (just ended up being where the conversation went) and they both agreed (poor choice of word) they wanted to get married. 

All this hoopla about ""man must ask"" and getting married, the wedding itself, the big show of bridesmaids and filled churches and everything else; personally, I can do without. It's just a cultural norm and means nothing, once you really think about it. It's just ""conditioning"", not a natural state of things."

"This fucking movie. I came here looking for it. Fuck this movie. I honestly can't speak to the quality because I've only seen it the one time, but it gave me a full blown phobia of caves. 


I didn't realize it until I went on a hike with my family to visit a short cave system a few weeks after seeing it, the movie had scared me but I'm scared by most horror movies so I didn't give it much thought. Then we got to the cave and it all came crashing back. I refused to go inside, everyone else went through to see the waterfall on the other side but I just looked at that opening and flat out refused. They came back and insisted I go through to see the waterfall and I ended up being dragged through, I figured I'd get over it once I was inside and they assured me it was an incredibly short walk. I started to panic the second we left daylight and had to physically be pulled while clinging to a family member. My legs refused to work right. It really was a short cave and it took maybe five minutes to get through even with my dramatics. But I ended up hyperventilating at the waterfall from being so scared. 


Nowadays anything cave related makes me uncomfortable. I love the Planet Earth series, but I have a really hard time watching the Caves episode. Even looking at pictures of caves gives me the creeps. I absolutely detest dealing with Falmer in Skyrim. The first time I played through I refused to do any of the dwarven ruins. I don't know if they made them that eerie on purpose or if it's just me.

"My mother died in April, she just wanted people to talk to and who could make her laugh, she wanted me, my brother and sister to keep doing what we were doing without changing anything despite of the situation.

My father, who was the main caregiver, needed someone to help him with cooking and all the diverse chores around the house. He did not want to talk a lot with people from the moment they told him she was going to die, although I tried to make him vent with me as often as I could. However, if you are not a family member or a really close and important person in the life of the caregiver, I do not think you should try to make him talk. Before the situation became so bad he did want (and needed) to talk with people and to go out a bit from time to time (to take a walk, a coffee, etc). We were extremely lucky because they gave him as much free time as he needed in his job, which makes me think that there are a lot of things a person who has a situation in which they still have to work in a normal schedule will have very different needs.

My siblings and I just needed friends which we could have fun with and talk from time to time. I also found of great help that my girlfriend tried to make me vent from time to time, without being intrusive."

"&gt; You receive a semi-automatic assault riffle

It's not semi-automatic while you're in the service. While you can shoot it in semi-auto, you classify a firearm's action from the highest capability, not the lowest. 

E.g. the American's would call it a select-fire rifle (you can select another firemode), which in US law would make it a machine gun.

You don't need to join a shooting federation in Switzerland to own a firearm either.

"Either way I do hate that argument. Just like how, and this does not equate to all times there are many, many valid times, that two people are drunk and someone claims rape. They always say one party can't consent due to drinking. If they both drank they both cannot consent. Regret isn't rape. I'm willing to bet there are a lot of guys screwed (not like that) this way. Again I know not every time is like this I just think there are significantly more like this than there should be. In the real situations I hope they find the help and I'm terribly sorry for what happened."

"What I admire is how you can be as batshit crazy as you want and nobody (legally, at least) can tell you to tone it down. If I understand correctly, the Church of the Invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster was born out of that sentiment. And more disturbingly, the 76 genders thing. Hypothetically, you can open a church for an invisible lump of spaghetti flying around and claim it's the world's creator and not the Abrahamic gods. Here it's more... simplified...  
Legally, you can be an atheist, but not so much in practice. Every job interview I've been through literally started with questions about my religious beliefs. I had to rebrand myself as an agnostic atheist. Hell, you guys have **actual goddamn nazis** that has the law protecting their right to be nazis (provided they don't attempt to start a second holocaust)!  
Also, the manual self defense thing. Here, unless you're a soldier you have to go through an incredible pain in the ass to get a gun of any kind legally. In America you apparently sign a couple of forms, go to a psych eval to show that you're sane enough to own a gun and wait a few days for it to arrive. Hell, you can go to Walmart, pick up some iced tea, poptarts and a brand new AR15! What the absolute fuck!

What I find odd, however, is the lack of proper global health security. I'm on antiepileptic drugs and... It's costly. It could be far more costly, though.  
Considering the US is one of the richest places on Earth, second (third?) to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, you'd expect some better health treatment."

Again, this guy was actively dissecting and could have died right there in the ER. If Oz could have done something he wouldn’t have been giving a pep talk he would be wheeling the patient back to the OR not waiting around. As for what he did in the actual OR.. yeah I guess I don’t know.. but probably assisting not taking turns.

Found this girl on MeetMe. All her pictures made her look nice and while talking with her she sounded like a nice girl and she lived a few miles from me so I thought we should go out. I went to pick her up and her parents house looked like a crack den that exploded. Figured that I shouldn't judge a book by its cover and maybe she just drew the Short straw when it came to family. Knocked on the door and was met by a woman holding a baseball bat. I was then ushered inside after she recognized me as her daughter's date. The house was worse inside than outside and I couldn't wait to get out. I met the daughter and she was a nice girl but definitely on the same stuff her parents were on. I took her out to dinner and a movie still but when she started to hint that she wanted me to come back to her place for some after date fun I decided to take my leave.

"I used alot of different drugs and daily, I was aware of what I was doing, I just didnt care. A regular was candy flipping, but mdma was around 4 times a week, coke probably 5 times a week, cannabis and booze daily and amphetamines 2 times a week. This was getting progressively worse over a 2 year period, acid helped level me a couple times but the last was some acid, pills, coke, weed and booze. It was about 4 hours till I came up, 3 days later I came down, I could no longer take anything that brought back memories or even remote feelings of tripping. I was experiencing hallucinations on a daily basis which was brought on by panic attacks which were caused whenever I started to become detached and had the feeling of no control over my thinking. 

I wasn't the only one who fucked up, one friend ended up sectioned and another has never been the same.

I understand my using is chaotic, hence why I went off the deep end for a while. The chaotic usage just transferred to booze and coke, then opiates, booze, coke and benzos. My using was never for fun, just that I was too depressed to deal with reality. Suicidal since 11 and such."

"Better transport,more resources for the homeless, large numbers of tourists who tend to be way more generous than residents, many commuters coming in and out of certain areas constantly. If you're going to pan handle or go busking you want to do it in the most busy areas you can. 

A lot of homeless also have personal issues with mental health or drugs/drink, sometimes a combination of those and they become ashamed of it so they like being able to blend into a city with millions of people. People in a city tend to care about what others are doing less than in small towns where homeless will often be demonized and harassed. 

Also possible they are looking for work but a lot of people I met while homeless that had jobs came from the city and couldn't afford their home anymore for one reason or another because they ended up broke. They still went to work daily and showered at the gym. "

Sad thing is I went into nursing to see if medicine was right for me, because I knew that a lot of premeds switch out either due to difficulty or not wanting the lifestyle. So I did my best to mitigate that risk, but I still worry.

It probably stems from the sheer magnitude of commitment required to come out on top in this field.

"So... everyone from every major will say it felt like a mistake at some point in their life. It’s not really the work that fulfills and defines you but how you approach the work.

As an artist that never went to college and has managed to stay employed (as an artist) for the past 20 years, production art will kill your sense of self worth just like any other job. In some ways I think it can be worse, because you start off really enjoying what you do only to have it twist and morph into complete apathy. Or worse something you hate. 

I’ve managed to keep my optimism and find contentment in my work after a lot of struggling, and mostly with a lot of the same things you are dealing with now. For me the joy comes from what I do when there are no restrictions or deadlines, from having the freedom to be there for my family and do things outside of work.

As someone who guest lectures, reviews portfolios and hires new artists I’ll say this, you don’t need a degree in art (or the debt) to do it. Talent (which is really practice) and persistence are all you need. The training they offer in school is mostly an excuse to focus and practice, at a high cost. 

I often regret never going to college. If nothing more than not having something to fall back on. I wonder if I could have avoided a lot of struggles and headaches especially with art, if I had found a nice 9-5 and done art on the side. 

I have seen many artists over the years that get their passion pissed on and never recover, I was one of the lucky persistent ones that has kept at it until I found the joy again. 

I imagine this struggle doesn’t apply to just me or to just artists, but it’s something everyone faces as they hit that age and deal with those issues.

Shit gets better, hang in there, keep yourself healthy, keep pushing forward."

"Cmon man. You hope you will succeed? I can tell you're stronger than that. And think about it, you're the only one who can fix this problem. You HAVE to succeed. It may sound forceful but it's true. If everyone says you're nice, then that's what you are. Sure you may have turned your back on them, but they probably understand why. Please don't harm yourself, get back on your feet. We know you can do this. Don't wait for an opportunity, just make an opportunity. 
Also don't hate yourself, in doing so, you're just destroying yourself even more. Look in the mirror and say, ""Wow, look how far I've come, the achievements I've made, and the amazing people I've befriended. I am an amazing person and I know it."" Because from your comment, that's what I think of you.  I was always lonely, still am. I don't want anyone to go through that, all it takes is just one conversation and you can have a friend. If they don't want to talk, too bad for them, they won't get a nice friend like you. If they are lonely like you, then keep talking to them, make them feel better. We know you can overcome this hurdle. 4 years is a long time. So that just means more time to be happy and live. I know you will succeed and so should you. 😀"

It took a few weeks and several hundred disgusting phone calls, uncomfortable propositions and down right scary encounters with the most horrid horny men. It got to the point that most of the time the ""clients"" would request me as I was the youngest there by a mile and with an ever pushy boss, I finally took my leave and never went back.

You are not relying on anyone to help with the rent, so no worrying about them being irresponsible or unexpectedly vacating the place. 

Living alone simplifies a lot of things.  "

"I remember being stupidly adamant about not doing a chore, even if it was easy. I think it's because I wanted to practice the newfound capacity to defy my parents.

Also when I went to college and lived with messy roommates I began to realize how annoyed my parents must have been, trying to get everyone to do their part."

"The recent one about the Trump supporter was especially disturbing to me, because he seemed completely aware that Liberalism seems correct, but too complicated for him to think about, so he preferred to subscribe to a simpler worldview.

I'm politically very liberal, but I've been looking at a lot of debates with right-wingers, and I see this all the time. Valuable statistics about race/birth control/poverty - all are dismissed in favour of a simplistic worldview that people are completely responsible for their own choices and must escape their circumstances. ""Just make better choices"" is the solution to all of society's ails.

And if I try to think about how I can convince the conservatives in my family, I have to think about how I would need to teach them a whole new fact-based worldview, and it fills me with hopelessness. You need to start dismantling an entire fantasy world, and rebuilding from reality. The fact that this guy chose ignorance wilfully just disgusted me."

from my understanding many professionals believe the best way to deal with gender dysphoria is either counseling or helping them transition. as soon as i found out that transitioning is actually a recommended way to alleviate gender dysphoria in people that actually have it my perspective completely flipped."

This lady, probably in her 40s or 50s, was EXTREMELY rude. She started screaming at us and saying shit like “Can’t you see there’s an old person here? Fcking kids these days using the shelter” FIRST OF ALL, we didn’t even see her standing behind us! There was nobody at the bus stop when we got there.  She could’ve just said “excuse me” and politely ask us to let her use the shelter.

I got so heated I couldn’t even speak. We let her stand in the shelter and that should’ve been the end of the conversation; but no, this lady decides to take it one step further and she continues to mumble “fcking kids these days; they have no respect!” and continues to cuss us out for doing nothing wrong for the next 10 or so minutes. 

It’s real sad seeing people act like this nowadays.

"We don't really know who built the ancient city of Teotihuacan in Mexico.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan)  


&gt;The city was already in ruins by the time of the Aztecs. For many years, archaeologists believed it was built by the [Toltec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec). This belief was based on colonial period texts, such as the [Florentine Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentine_Codex), which attributed the site to the Toltecs. However, the Nahuatl word ""Toltec"" generally means ""craftsman of the highest level"" and may not always refer to the Toltec civilization centered at [Tula, Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tula,_Hidalgo). Since Toltec civilization flourished centuries after Teotihuacan, the people could not have been the city's founders.

"Back in middle school there were incidents involving “the weird kid” in school where he would go around at recess trying to hump anyone he could find (mostly people that stopped to tie their shoes).

The employee comes back with my laptop and is telling me what they did when the guys behind me start closing in and trying to get in front of me and start interrupting our conversation. ""We've been waiting here for too damn long, give me my computer back!"" said the grumpy old man. The employee said to them that he'd call someone over to help, and the guy just says ""You better fucking be quick we were here first."" Even though I was RIGHT THERE. I turned and said ""Look old fart, you need to wait your turn,"" to which the guy says 'how dare you talk to my papa like that blah blah blah disrespectful kids' while the employee just tells me to call his phone number later on and he'd give me the full details of what had happened, gave me my laptop back, and sent me on my way. The employee and I kept in touch for a little while after because he was my go-to for tech repairs, but he later quit after that incident."

"I'm 24.

I have a wife, I work, and I come home to read/play games/watch movies.

That is my life. I do literally nothing outside of that.

My wife and I sometimes go out to eat, but most of our ""Outings"" together are just for shopping.

I am probably the happiest I have ever been in my life. I want for nothing, have a solid relationship with a human being that understands me, and I love my cat. The most exciting thing I do in a given week is shop on Amazon for more books or Steam for more games.

I'm telling you all of this not because I want you to feel bad about what you want in life, but because I want you to know that there are people like me that are perfectly content to do absolutly nothing with their lives outside of a few nice gestures. (I personally buy groceries for the person behind me in the check out line sometimes)

If I suddenly had the opportunity to just not work for the rest of my life and simply enjoy the rest of my time with my wife, cat, books, and games, I'd likely be a good contender for the happiest man alive."

If topping yourself becomes as instant and painless as using a vending machine, I'd imagine a lot of people who might have changed their mind after a day's careful thinking (or who would have realised as they planned their death that they didn't truly want to go through with it), would just march into the machine.

Not sure if it was faked but then again, there has been fucked stories on 4chan that were true like the guy who posted co-ordinates that lead to the body of a woman he killed or the one where the guy murdered his girlfriend then wrote how he had a fake gun and planned to commit suicide by cop (but it failed and he was captured alive and sentenced to prison)"

"I was dragged unwilling to see *Jaws* at age 10 by my mother and 9-year-old brother. We had to stand in an insane line for hours, with me going “I don’t want to see it. I don’t want to see it.” The whole time, like I was auditioning for a “Gillian cut” gag. 

I *begged* them to let me go off on my own while they watched it— it was a theater in a mall, so I could easily have amused myself “shopping” (gawking at cool stuff) while they watched a shark eat people, but nooooooo.

So in we went...and my nightmares began. After the second attack—the one where the young boy was killed—I bailed. I just told my mom I’d meet them at the theatre when it was over, and finally she let me leave. (Ironically, the rest of the movie wasn’t nearly as terrifying as those first two deaths—more adventure than horror—but I didn’t find that out for another 20 years or so.)

But the damage was done. Forever afterwards, if I dream of water, chances are 75% that a shark will show up. I was already not that fond of swimming...this cemented my distaste for aquatic pastimes. Screw the water."

"It was more of a slow transition away from Facebook toward Reddit.

Facebook:

* Boring

* Bragging

* Arguing

That got tiring.  

What got me addicted to Reddit were the story threads. You have to take them with a grain of salt, but the quality threads are 100x more entertaining than stuff people share on Facebook. Funnier, weirder, and oddly more human.

A few favorites:

[I e-mailed a teacher to say thank you, and he posted it on Facebook saying ""I really needed this."" What's something you've said/done that you didn't expect to have such a big impact?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8p92/i_emailed_a_teacher_to_say_thank_you_and_he/) -- This thread is the *Chicken Soup for the Soul* of Reddit. Heartwearming, uplifting stories. 

[What is the most random way you met someone who you eventually dated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9hop38/what_is_the_most_random_way_you_met_someone_who/) - Some good romantic comedy material.

[Redditors born into a criminal family, how and when did you realize something wasn't quite right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1q7ncs/redditors_born_into_a_criminal_family_how_and/) -- It was fascinating to look at criminal activity from an innocent child's eyes.

[\[Serious\] People who were involved in sending spam offers \(such as the infamous ""enlarge your penis""\), how did the company look from ""the inside""? How much were you paid? serious replies only](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2rb53l/serious_people_who_were_involved_in_sending_spam/) -- Incredible stories. My favorite was the guy who went behind-the-scenes of those psychic readings ads in tabloid newspapers.

[Reddit, what's that one, awesome thing you found on the internet but could never find again?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i2w1j/reddit_whats_that_one_awesome_thing_you_found_on/) - It was really fun to see redditors help each other reunite with a cool thing on the web they thought they'd never see again. My favorite was the [PDF science fiction novel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i2w1j/reddit_whats_that_one_awesome_thing_you_found_on/c20ge6y/). 

[What's the weirdest thing you've done while your brain was on autopilot?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/65ylpz/whats_the_weirdest_thing_youve_done_while_your/) - Hilarious.

"Very much depends on not only your service, but your community within the service, where you are, and your command, to varying extents. 

It really comes down to those three things. Your community, your location, and your command. You need two out of the three to have a good time. 

Good community/Good Location: I'll deal with a shitty command because I'm doing what I want to do in a place I want to be. 

Good Location/Good Command: I don't really care which community I'm in because I'm somewhere I want to be with a good command.

Good Command/Good Community: If I'm doing something I want to do with a good command- dammit, I'll go anywhere. 

Everything from your normal routine, working hours, watch/duty schedule comes down to the relationship with those three things. You hope to have all three, it's possible to get two, realistically, you'll have one of those three go your way.  "

"I am indecisive and I love food, so naturally at restaurants I look at menus and want many different things. Usually i'll see something that I know for sure that I'd like, or something that initially jumps out at me, and I'll narrow it down to two things. Then I'll ask the waiter what I should get out of those two, and 95% of the time one of them is a top seller or their favorite thing on the menu, and I get it. This has helped a lot, and really keeps me from feeling like I ordered the wrong thing or missed out on something."

"Treatment is getting better, but a lot of it is targeted based on the exact type of cancer.  A cure for X cell cancer with gene Y isn't out of the question, but I think the changes will be a combination of specific solutions and small general improvements for at least a few more decades.  

Solving it *entirely* would mean a deeper understanding of biology on a cellular level, and the ability to manipulate things at a cellular level, or genetic and immune changes.  The stuff that would let us do that, would also allow us to do other big stuff, like slowing aging, or changes to the way we fight infection as big as the invention of antibiotics or vaccines.  Maybe possible within the lifetime of some currently living people, and if we can get some real anti-aging in the next 50 years, for current young people, a lifetime might be quite a bit longer than it is now.  Cancer would be a huge problem with life extension, except hopefully it can be fixed with a lot of the same tools."

I knew I wanted to marry him regardless of his status because he was that important to me. I also wanted my extended family to see him as family.

She instantly caught herself getting ahead of herself and tried to play it off and take a sip and ended up choking a little and coughing. It was THE BEST attempt she could possibly mess up at hiding her actual true love/feelings for me.

I was so in love with the moment that I turned to her and with a straight face, I said ""Olive Juice."" She turned super bright red because she knew she was caught/embarrassed and of course excited cause this boy she liked for awhile actually loved her back.

There's no way in 7 hells he gets removed from office unless he becomes extremely toxic which would mean he's probably already that toxic.

"Tony Stark has never really done it for other people, he’s always done it because he feels immense guilt and responsibility. He can come to terms with the world being the way it is because Thanos couldn’t have been his fault, and it’s a kicker to realising he’s always had the best intentions while everyone else in the Avengers was reactionary"

So I was at the height of my preteen fandom excitement when Star Wars was the Coolest Thing Ever, and was in the process of developing a spectacular crush on Darth Vader.

So it was approximately the greatest moment of my life up to that point when I wander into the living room, see this on the TV screen, and as soon as I've got my bearings regarding what's going on here I'm given the ""raspberry"" scene and laughing too hard to breathe . . . the idea of Darth Vader banging on the side of a ship and then getting banged on the head by the door coming down because he's jostled it was my favorite mental image for years to come."

"Depends on the brand. They all have a slight licorice taste from the anise, but it's otherwise as varied as any other liqueur. If you don't just hate anise, try a different brand, and make sure you louche it rather than drink it straight (or try lighting it on fire), which does not give you the intended flavor profiles.

I recommend Tennison (smooth and mild but flavorful) or St George (strong with a unique bouquet) or Kubler (cheap and generic but does the job, milder), and stay away from Lucid (cat piss), Absinte (not actually absinthe and tastes only slightly worse than lucid), La Verte (basically cologne labeled as absinthe), and La Torment (cat piss flavored cologne). If you hate anise, Mata Hari is an option that is otherwise absinthe and pretty decent in its own right. "

"It would have probably been worse if Nixon were still President. Republicans might been willing to vote to convict Nixon on principle, but it helped that Nixon's approval ratings were already in the gutter. If Nixon's popularity was as high as Trump's right now (~40%), it would have been much harder to get him out of office by impeachment, and he almost certainly wouldn't have resigned.

The difference between then and now is public opinion. People are willing to support Trump even if he did things that are 100 times worse than Watergate, and so Republican politicians can't afford to oppose him without risking getting successfully primaried by a Trump Republican."

1973, Trump violated fair housing act by refusing to rent to blacks

1992 Trump lost an appeal because he was fined $200,000 for removing dealers at his casino specifically because they were black

1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump's Castle, accused another one of Trump's businesses of discrimination. ""When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor""

1991: A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant: ""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control."" Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that ""the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.""

"There was girl at my school that actively tried for the ‘manic pixie dream girl’ reputation. She’d just always say stuff like hating social media because it kept her mind locked on things instead of letting it be ‘free’ as she wanted it to be. So basically people on social media were always locked on things when they needed serious advice, and she’d just tell them to ‘free themselves’. Stuff like that. Everybody liked her, but she annoyed me to no end. 

One day, she wore a dress made with Star Wars cloth/fabric and everybody raved about it while she was saying how neat it was to be able to design your own clothes and how it was a dying skill to be able to make your own things, YOURSELF. She took all the credit for it, and wasn’t really a Star Wars fan. She told me about picking out the fabric, and then couldn’t answer when I asked if it had the Death Star on it. 

I knew it was a pattern and I knew her mom made it for her, since we had known each other a long time. She was that person that always needed something different or quirky so people would comment on it, then if they asked where she got it, she’d say “idk” or “thrift store” or “I made it”

But I won't because that's not the point. Point is, getting to see new Star Wars stories on the big screen, seeing those sabers light up on the big screen again, space battles, new and old planets, characters, anything and everything is just plain cool. 

At the end of the day, when a new movie is announced I'm head-over-heels excited for it. I don't care if it's an origin story that doesn't need to be told or if it's a trilogy that completely upends my own projection of the universe.

I'm just freaking happy we're getting more Star Wars movies at all.

"I do. First off, Christmas is a religious holiday and I am not religious. Secondly, I am also (more strongly so) opposed to the commercialization of Christmas. All this pressure and expectation that you gotta get a gift for someone and the more you spend, the better Christmas is. People feel slighted when they can tell that your gift is cheap, or if you don't get them one. You're expected to buy gifts for people that you don't know very well, or maybe don't even like.

I buy heartfelt gifts for people year round. The gifts are very personal, very meaningful, and come out of nowhere! Now, just because it's December, I'm expected to go buy more gifts? I like seeing my family for Christmas, but I don't like that I feel obliged to spend money and give gifts.

The problem is, who's even going to call for it?  Corbyn is anti-EU.  May is utterly dependent on votes from people who are frothing-at-the-mouth Leave.

"Freezing to 'death'. I was three years old when I had to have heart surgery, but as I had been two months premature and had heart troubles that caused my growth to be partially stunted they couldn't trust anesthesia not to kill me, but they needed my heart slowed as slow as possible for the operation. So, they literally packed me in ice. To this day I remember the feeling of pins and needles. How it intensified to pain, then agony. I remember the terror as my limbs gradually lost feeling from the tips inward. How that terror reached a crescendo once I lost feeling in my torso and it headed up to my head just before losing consciousness. People that say freezing is an easy death have clearly never searched an icy cooler for a drink a little too long. Imagine that but then your hand gets tied up and can't be removed, and spread that feeling through your whole body. No thanks. I mean, technically the moment of death would be painless, but everything leading up to it is horrible."

My uncle came to get me back into the drug world.  Because I was going through withdrawals, and was paranoid because druggy people kept screwing with me, my Uncle told my Mom that I was smoking meth to get her to kick me out so I'd go back to drugs.

The teacher laid into me for cheating, and then for ""lying"", as the other girl had admitted to cheating, but said I had allowed her to look at my paper, I guess to make it seem less shitty on her end. After class, I called the girl out, things got heated, and long story short, I kicked her ass. One of only two fights I've ever been in."

But if someone says ""I never poke lions with sticks"" you should say ""Me neither"" if you are going for brevity."

"I am a little late to this but you do it because you have to do it and don’t have any other options. 

I am a father of triplets who will be 4 and a 7 year old. I have two boys and two girls. My triplets were born early at 27 weeks and we have had a ton of complications. We were in the hospital for 15 months straight before they all came home. My daughter baby c is full time 24/7 care. She has a Trach, g tube, shunt, seizures,cerebral palsy and the list goes on and on. She is the most challenging of my kids but is also the happiest with simple things in life. My son baby b had brain bleeds at birth and is caught up with no issues now. My son baby a is autistic and has cerebral palsy. He can’t talk or walk but is happy and moving along really good. We also have my 7 year old daughter who is like a mom to the triplets. My house is always complicated with therapy appointments and trauma bay visits for seizures and so on. 

I saw a meme one day that said parents whose take care of multiples and even more kids with complications and ongoing medical issues. 

It said a good day would be a very bad day for a normal person and my bad days are even worse. 

As a parent you keep hoping that things will get better and you will see your kids grow up and do normal things. Sometimes you have to come to grip with the fact that this may be the better and things won’t get better. 

I have thought about doing an AMA about having multiples, children in the hospital for months, probably 35-40 times my children having surgery and 5 of those were brain surgery. But when would I have tine for that. I write this sitting in the ER with my daughter who has been vomiting blood the past 36 hours. "

"It may not seem like much, but this pissed me off.  One month (about 15yrs ago) I see a $25 charge on my Amex from a company I don't  recognize.  Even then I bought a lot of stuff on line, so I figured it was software or something.  But I wanted to know.  So I called Amex and asked what it was.  They had no clue and (without asking me) cancelled the charge.  Ok.

A few years later I get a collection notice for $25 for an unpaid debt.  Same company.  So I call the collection agency and tell them I am happy to pay the bill if they can tell me what the $25 was for.  Seems reasonable the agent says, and they will get back to me with that info.  I hear nothing back.  Months later, I get another collection notice.  Same conversation, but this time I asked to talk to a manager.  He totally understood and would get back to me with the information.  Nothing.  This process repeats for about 5 **years**, when I guess they gave up.

Was checking my credit report a few years later and yep, there was the $25 delinquent charge.  I filed a document explaining the situation.  It has since fallen off my report.

I think there was a good chance the charge was legit, but the fact that no one could tell me what it was for was maddening."

"It is the night of the 21st of September, 1788. Emperor Joseph II of Austria leads more than 100,000 men in a campaign to drive the Turks out of Europe. He sets up camp during the day near the Romanian town of Karansebes, and uses the night to dispatch a cavalry scouting party to find where the Turks are, so he can attack them in the morning. The Emperor and his generals hear nothing back from the scouts for hours, and fear the worst. They sent hundreds of infantry after them to find them. To their horror, they soon hear the sound of gunshots- frightfully close to the camp.

Their worst fears are soon confirmed. Both the cavalry and the infantry are spotted in total disarray, fleeing for their lives back towards the Austrian camp.

""Turks! Turks!"" they all shout in unison. The Emperor and his generals panic. The cunning Turks knew they would attack by day, and launched an attack in the dark of night. They race out of their command tent and furiously try to assemble a battle line. However, they find that the Turks, moving with lightning speed, have already broken into the camp.

""Allah! Allah!"" they hear in the distance. Shaking in their boots, many officers make peace with the fact that they have already lost the day, and now, the only thing they can do is stand and die honorably.

A wall of cavalry races through the East side of the camp, knocking over tents and wreaking utter havoc on the Austrian soldiers. ""Fire!"" orders the Austrian artillery commander. The cannons roar, and a wall of smoke descends over the center of the camp. The Turks fire back, and hundreds fall on the Austrian side. Turkish cavalry break through the Austrian line, cutting down Austrian troops in the dark. ""Allah! Allah!"" - the cries get closer and closer to the Emperor. 

The sound of gunfire wakes up the entire camp. Panic breaks out, and soon, the camp is in a full-blown rout. The Turks chase the Austrians as they flee. They fire on them from the trees and their cavalry cut down the escaping Austrian soldiers. Knowing the situation was hopeless, Emperor Joseph orders a retreat, that devolves into a panicked rout. In the chaos, Emperor Joseph is pushed off his own horse into a river.

The Austrians regroup further North. Thousands died as a result of the Turkish night attack. 1,200 more were wounded and are shipped to a nearby castle to recover.

Emperor Joseph is exhausted from the battle. In his despair, he can't get out of bed and naps until afternoon. Soon, however, he is rudely awoken by one of his officers, presenting to him a report on the Turkish attack.

Nervously, the officer reports to the Emperor that *there was no Turkish attack at all*.

In the night, the cavalry scouts found no Turks, but they did find travelling gypsies, who sold them alcohol. The cavalry got madly drunk. The infantry sent to find them demanded some of the alcohol when they arrived. Soon, a scuffle broke out, and the infantry fired on the cavalry. Everyone involved was worried that the sound of gunshots would alert the Turks to their position, and fled immediately back to camp, expecting a Turkish attack. The multi-ethnic soldiers couldn't understand eachother, and, by the time the tired soldiers got back to camp, the story of their flight had devolved into ""Turks! Turks!"".

""Halt! Halt!"" officers shouted as they were rudely awakened by horses and men running outside. However, in the commotion, the army misinterpreted ""Halt! Halt!"" for ""Allah! Allah!""

The artillery commander knew this was his moment to shine. He saw hundreds of cavalry racing towards his position. He ordered his men to fire. The artillery smoke clouded everyone's vision in the already dark night, and woke up the entire camp. The cavalry, completely confused, started fighting back. The smoke divided the camp in two, and both sides started firing at eachother. Most of the troops were sleeping before, and amid gunshots, sights of cavalry hacking infantry to death, and cries of ""Turks!"" and ""Allah!"", most chose to flee. The Emperor, believing he was defeated, ordered an immediate retreat.

On the morning of the 24th, the Turkish Sultan finally launched his real assault on the Austrian camp. His army marched into the camp, discovering nothing but thousands of dead bodies."

In terms of my SO, I can't speak for the community because I've never had a SO. However, I know that often within the asexual community, there are often asexual couples. Also, some members of the asexual community are aromantic, meaning that they don't experience romantic attraction. These people therefore have no desire to seek out a partner, sexual or otherwise."

This is roughly the time period where Exodus is based.

"&gt;if the dems win the house (I’m starting to have my doubts)

Dems have very very good odds of winning the house, Most recent odds ive seen is a 70% chance. That said the odds of Dems taking the Senate is still very very low.

&gt;and there is no valid argument for impeachment at the moment

I would call this debatable. I think there are valid arguments but none that are strong enough to really make it worth attempting. Itd just for sure get voted down. 

I would however argue that certain parts of his statements over why he fired Comey etc are arguably impeachable. IE they are evidence of obstruction of justice. Now Id argue its not concrete enough to really bother but i can see the argument to there is evidence now worthy of trial and debate (which is all impeachment is).

I think anything done before the Mueller report is rushing and doing things too politically. Let the investigation play out, get the report, and decide from there.

The only exception to this in my mind thatd make it worth doing is if he goes and fires Mueller. At that point its clear cut obstruction of justice and hed have to be held accountable. You cant just shut down investigations related to you because you dont like them.

"Something I love about the modern usage of the terms is that villains tend to have a deliberate grandioseness in their writing. We don't talk about Maleficent, Jafar, and Scar as Disney Antagonists, they're *Disney Villains*, the ultimate embodiments of evil within their respective stories. The Terminator, the Wicked Witch, Sauron, the Alien, and Hans Gruber are all generally considered villains. Somebody like, say, King Claudius (Hamlet's uncle) isn't someone you'd think of as a villain despite clearly being the antagonist."
"Exilirating and always suprising.

The story goes:

It was when we had a trend where people were posting ""As a X I see the world like this"". There were tons of image, and I say TONS of images about the subject.

I was lurking on reddit when I decided to hastily throw my hat in the ring and see what would happen. Sadly, I could not see it happen until I came back after my godchild's baptism much later at night.

The thread had exploded and not only it had over a thousand upvote, it was THE top link. Mind you, it was at a time when Reddit was much smaller than this.

At least I carry the achievement of the highest ranking link in my tool box. That being said, the image I posted still pops up once in a while, which I find hilarious.

"I used to work at a gas station and we sold breakfast burritos that were plain or with peppers and onions. This is the actual word for word conversation.

Customer: “get me a breakfast burrito”

Me: “pepper and onions, or plain?”

Customer: “that one”

Me , assuming that the last one I said was the one he was referring to grabs him the plain one.

Customer: “i didn’t f****** ask for that one I asked for the other one!!”

I then repeated the whole conversation to him, he got mad and said he wasn’t arguing with a damn 20 year old and left. He then proceeded to call my manager and scream at her and tried to get me fired. "

"I’ve experienced it through parental love, which I know makes me very blessed as that isn’t always the case. I’ve watched them love my sibling unconditionally. I also feel that sort of love for all of them. Even when I disagree with something they do and we fight at the end of the day I love them. 

As for romantic love I have loved unconditionally before. That love wasn’t reciprocated, but I gave it. The big thing to remember is unconditional love doesn’t mean you don’t get mad, you don’t fight and sometimes you don’t really like the person but you still want to know them and want what’s best for them.

I talked about it with him, asking him why we can’t just fuck and get it over with and he didn’t have an answer. It was like he was into the emotional intimacy of the relationship and appearance of it, but didn’t want to be committed to me and didn’t want to actually be physical with me. We were *inseperable,* literally hung out 20 hours a day, but he wanted to keep the option for someone else open. It made me feel like absolute trash. He didn’t get with anybody during our friendship and I think he *still* hasn’t been with anyone (this was 2 years ago). I had several people tell me they think he might be gay and he’s questioning. There are others things about him that could give evidence to that... "

"Laff, we aren't going to make it anywhere near 200 years. Right around 2050 a bunch of things are going to converge. First, water scarcity is going to become common because of the effects of global warming melting all the glaciers that humans rely on for water. It's already happening now in South Africa and Brazil.

With the water drying up, the great bread basket of the world, the US, won't be able to produce nearly enough of the grains we rely on to eat. Between lot of farmland becoming un-farmable in the Midwest and California's central valley. But not just here in the US, lots of other countries are going to experience huge losses of farmland because of water scarcity. On top of that, at current growth rates, there will be 4-5 billion more people to feed on the planet.

We are fishing the oceans out at a rapid rate. Much of it is already fished out, but by 2050, there really won't be much sea food left to fish. Considering the large number of humans that rely on seafood for sustenance, it's going to have a large effect.

So yeah, current resources are not going to last anywhere near 200 years. I feel sorry for young kids today because I know they're fucked. By 2050 the world is going to be a really shitty place to live. Glad I'll be dead before then. Fortunately for me, the resources will last my lifetime. But not much longer. Provided I don't live too long. "

"First of all he was a homeless transgender friend of a friend I agreed to house for like 4 weeks, that became 4 months untill they finally got kicked out. .

To list his transgressions in order they would probably be something like this:

Leaving chopped up dead birds in trashbags at said friends house.

Constantly berating my siblings for minor infractions.

Demanding free rides to every doctors appointment and work day (3rd shift) they had but never giving noticen just expecting a ride. 

Stalking another friend of mine.

Lying on a regular basis.

In 4 months they showered and did laundry probably 4 times. We have perfectly fine facilities he was just lazy. 

Lying about being raped by his previous roommate, because they wouldnt sleep with him.

Bringing his DEMONSPAWN of a cat into the house and never feeding her, paying attention to her, or letting her leave our room.

Not cleaning the litterbox in our room.

Threatening to hit my autistic brother because he wanted to pet the kitty.

Not allowing me in MY OWN ROOM because he was ALWAYS ASLEEP and god forbid if I woke him up. 

Threatening to hurt me because I woke him up at 6pm. 

Lying to other people about how terrible we were. 

Instead of saving any money he blew it all on sephora makeup hed never use. 

Would make facebooks posts about wanting to kill himself all the time but not actually be upset in person.

Was a self proclaimed MAP (Minor Attracted Person) AKA A PEDOPHILE, got him kicked out for that.

I honestly wanted to give this person a chance and he just spat in my face. The day he left he never even said goodbye or thanked us for housing/feeding/clothing/driving him for free for 4 months. He just moved his shit and left. Fuck you Kei I hope you rot in hell you fucking psychopath.

It was becoming a little excessive because it was every employee every shift. One shift I was drinking (like everyone else) and got fired for it. My husband at the time had a really good job and I was just working for a little extra cash. I was only part time. They used me as an example and pretty much told me as much when I went back the next day to talk to the GM. Most of the people that worked there were desperate for a job. I was the only one who it wouldn’t “hurt”. The GM was a pretty fair guy most of the time. I was well like by managers and had been there several years. He felt like people would think, “If he’ll fired her, he’d fire me too.” And straighten up. And it worked for a little while. After about six months they offered me my job back. I didn’t go back. I still thought it was a little fucked up they fired me. "

He cracked her back and the next day she was walking pain free. Within 3 sessions she was back to running and he has shown us how her exercises are keeping those disks in place. I dare say she is better now than even before pregnancy.

If you like the setting, try out the previous game: Of Orcs and Men. The gameplay is alright (IMO), but the story is great. You play as an Orc, Arkhail, and a goblin, Styx, who are sent to assassinate the human emperor. Highlight: Arkhail can throw Styx at enemies during combat."

"&gt; have interiors ripped from the Star Trek set

I despise most of the current car interior designs, all pushing a dashboard that now consists of a single giant touchscreen.

Motherfuckers, I *do* want to be able to adjust music and suchlike while in motion.  I *do not* want to take my eyes off the road.  In the car I'm currently driving -- one with actual controls, like physical buttons and dials -- I can easily and safely feel my way around.  In the retarded ""flatscreen TV as dash"" design, I cannot.

No, fuckheads, your voice controls are not an acceptable replacement, because they don't work.  (For starters, see the years of bug reports about the voice processors picking up the music output.)

If there are no physical controls for basic dashboard functions, whether on the dash or worst case on the wheel, then your design is shit."

"The school board/superintendent didn't overreact. Admitterly, its statistically unlikely that your brother was actually going to shoot up the school - most kids don't do that. It probably  would've been fine to let him come back. 

But if they let him back and he did do something violent, they're fucked.  They get sued, the school district gets sued, they're unemployable for the rest of their lives, *and* they have to live with the fact that they made a decision that led to the death or injury of a bunch of kids.

But then after I got older and was in college and even older I realized how weird it would be if a group of guys had a bunch of high school girls they would invite out every weekend.

The world was freshly emerging from the horrors of WWII, in the midst of the fears of the Cold War, and there was some attempt by American culture to force family roles back into the ""ideal"" pre-war state, before Rosie the Riveter proved that she can do a man's job, and men were the providers whose opinion counted.

last time i quit it was because i had posted a very personal, very open, comment on a supposed 'survivors support' FB page. Anyone who recognizes my username knows i was sexually abused by my middle school french teacher, and because i have a penis, and she has a vagina, people treated me like shit for not enjoying it.

&amp;#x200B;

So i posted about my abuse, and the responses from these 'supporters' amounted to calling me a sexist, a misogynist, a rape apologist, and a number of other things i dont care to repeat because my blood pressure is already spiking as it is.

Nintendo games are REALLY US/Japan heavily focused, the market in Europe and South America leans way further in PC territory. Zelda for one isn't my cup of tea, but my 5 year old nephew loves it, my game of the year definitely doesn't fall in line with his, and that's perfectly fine. 

Objectively why was BOTW the best? Graphics to start with were shit, but that's platform limitation, missions I found to be repetitive, and the world exploration fell flat when you compare it to TW3 or Skyrim, but that's my experience tho, if you enjoyed it great."

"&gt;should I buy a 2 year old GPUs at or above msrp

Think of it this way. The 1080 Ti is such a beast that no game out there today is will be much of a challenge for it. That's why even with that 2 year old card, you're still ""master race"" because it wipes the floor running any game on the market. 

That's also why I'm not *overly* concerned with Nvidia being the only major player in high end GPUs, because they are basically running circles looking for someone to actually challenge them (either in hardware, or in newer games that actually need a better card). It's hard to improve their hardware when no game out there is even a challenge to their two year old card. What's the point in blowing money on R&amp;D for faster cards when nothing needs them? What's the point for the consumer in upgrading past the 1080Ti when no games even get close to requiring you to do so?"

"It has a lot to do with parenting as well. Just shoot straight and add emphasis to foundational aspects. It’s not really the content persay but more how it’s taught. 

A good example is the scientific method. People assume it’s just steps and when those really are an outline for a mentality and methodology for examining ideas. 

We notice all these gaps or ‘lies’ in our education in hindsight because we’ve come to understand all the stuff around it. School at least in the US is really easy and in a bad way favors short term learning and not thinking/skills development. It’s why YouTube videos explaining complex, topics can seem so fascinating compared to studying the same in high school.

So directly answering your question. I’d remove the whole difficulty by grade thing (reading level) and the idea of ‘in 8th grade we study blank’. Replace it with a leveling system that involves effort (time for the most part), mastery (tests 
,quizzes, applications etc) and explanation (teaching another or demonstrating to a teacher). Allowing a student to go at their own pace. Allow teachers and parents to see where their student is lacking and potentially create dynamic groupings via subject/topic. This way you can also put real world topics at specific grade levels for emphasis. (Health/puberty/sex Ed in 7th-9th, finance/taxes 11th-12th etc) that work more traditionally because they can be taught without a high level of biology etc."

"It depends on where you live. Small towns and older neighborhoods in bigger cities and going to look how you describe.

For example, management at my apartment complex picked a non-native tree to decorate the dog park with. Those trees looked nice, but provided no shade and were dead after two Texas summers.

"Disagree that “Nature Finds a Way” was a plot hole in that film. Or in this case. 

OP seems like they’re asking more about civility rather than extinction, but this page is riddled with people saying we’d be extinct. That seems unlikely, for lots of different reasons. The question of how it impacts our society has a lot to do with if men existed in the first place? Have they died out slowly? Was it quickly? There are no parameters on this question. Additionally evolution is happening in every single generation. Women’s hips are widening to help balance brain growth, people are being born without gall bladders. So yes. Depending on the rate of decline. We would likely evolve. "
I think it's fine as long as you know the person that you're doing it with is a person you can trust and isn't someone who is unstable. If it's a stranger you're running a huge risk not only of catching diseases even if you use protection but also of bringing someone into your life who's going to complicate things or have trouble with not wanting to date them afterwards you're also running the risk of sexual assault if you don't know you trust this person

Also, it was considered cool to have cut off army pants.  You'd cut them off at the bottom of the cargo pocket and have ""cargo shorts""

Seriously, you could only find them at the army/navy surplus store.

Pair that with a flannel shirt tied around your waist and any t shirt, along with a fitted baseball hat, fully bent and crimped bill, on backwards.  Light brown work boots a plus.

Just imagine, a perfectly good hat and bending the bill, on purpose.  We even took off the stickers and tags!."

"1 - This was when I was a kid, age 5 I think. A handyman working for my Dad found a tarantula  on the property. 

This fucking guy thought the natural thing to do was of course capture it, then start nailing it to my dad's work bench (Dad's work bench seems to be spider central).

He nailed its legs down and also its abdomen. It wasn't responding so the guy assumed it was dead. Then it moved as the guy hammered in one more nail.

Guy screamed and slammed the hammer down on the poor creature, sending goo flying. 

That was traumatizing, to say the least.

2 - A few years later, my cousin and I wanted to build a lemonade stand. I knew an old desk my dad kept under his work bench would be perfect for it. 

Problem was, the desk was heavy for us and fit tightly under the work bench (like nesting tables). The only way we could pull it out was by sliding our fingers in the very narrow space between the desk's top and the work bench's underside. 

As soon as we pulled the desk out we were greeted by an enormous wolf spider sitting between our pairs of hands. It was probably 5"" in diameter. 

To this day, I cannot stick my hands in tight spaces without imagining a wolf spider lurking. 


I am still afraid of spiders but I do my best to be kind to them. They are really fascinating creatures."

"This fucking douchebag PE teacher Mr. Farro. 

It was probably 7th grade, life is good, school is pretty easy. No real worries to think about. 

I had a baseball game one weekend where I slid home, but my sock came down a little bit and I ended up scraping the shit out of my knee. Didn't help that the catcher kind of fell on me at the same time, but whatever. 

I have to get my knee bandaged and it's pretty swollen at this point too. I didn't think I would need to go to the Dr's for what was basically swelling and a scrape, so I just went to school with a huge gauze pad and a wrap over it. 

Anyways, that Monday after the baseball game was ""Cross Country Mile Day,"" a mile around our soccer and baseball fields while only running one lap on our track. I could barely walk because of the swelling and the wrap, but because I **didn't have a doctor's note** I was forced to run the mile. Farro must've believed I was trying to pull a fast one or something, because he really didn't give a shit about anything that I was trying to tell him. 

Anyways, I limp the entire mile, get some ridiculous 23:32 time, and ended up being late to class because the bell rang while I still had a good ~5 minutes to go. 

That time ended up costing me an A (in fucking 7th grade PE of all classes...), and straight A's for that semester. 

If I had gotten all straight A's, my parents made a deal that I would be able to get a new laptop for school. 

Thanks you fucking asshole Farro. Youre not even good enough to be a HS PE teacher, let alone a middle school one.

So basically the tiniest steps so you can feel the reward of checking a box off and slowly work your way to the goal. But honestly once I start cleaning I can't stop.

Another thing we worked on was allowing 'nothing' to be on the to do list. It is something I could choose to do and it removed the guilt and judgement, and helped me place doing nothing in  similar category as doing other small tasks."

I mean come on, it ended in him stabbing her and running away because ""he thought she passed out"". If you really love someone, you don't run away after they passed out from being stabbed 30 times and then act surprised the next day when you find out they died. Crimes of passion do not equal love. They equal emotional immaturity. I'm not completely demonizing the guy. Maybe he truly did think in his head that he did love her. But his idea of love was a toxic distortion. "

"I met my partner online. I had just moved to a new city with my family and had started making a few new friends at college. They gave me the name of a website and told me to sign up to it because everyone from college was on it and I’d probably make some new friends in the process. 

So I get home and sign up. A couple of minutes later I get a message from a 50 odd year old man asking me if he could fuck me in the back of his bus after his shift?! Then all the other messages started to come through! 17 year old me couldn’t understand what the hell was going on or who these nut jobs were so I shut the laptop down and probs went to watch tv or something. 

Anyway about an hour later I open the computer and set about trying to figure out how to delete the page. I check the inbox one last time and there’s a message from a gorgeous looking guy. I opened it. “Hi there, I’m a bit confused, my mate told me to look on this site but it seems like it’s a swinging site or something?? Anyway just thought I’d say hello because I saw your picture and you look pretty normal. I’m probably going to delete this account now because this is not the site I thought it was lol!” I quickly messaged back saying that I was in the same boat and we sent a few messages back and forth and had a giggle at the pervy old men that we’re after me. We finally decided to swap email addresses and started talking over msn messenger. A few weeks later I gave him my number and we spoke for the first time for over 4hours. That became a nightly thing, as well as the constant texting throughout the day. 

I was 17 and not really into boys or looking to find myself a boyfriend but we just clicked and I can honestly say it was love at first sight. Trouble was he lived over 100miles away and in ordinary circumstances we would never ever have met. He was a couple of years older than me, we lived in completely different places and we’re into completely different things. 

Anyway, 10 years and three children later he is still the love of my life and I thank my lucky stars everyday that I have him. I could cry thinking how I very nearly never met him and how much of a coincidence/fate it was that I did.

"Late to the party, but I think this one deserves to be here, a 2 in 1: 

&amp;#x200B;

I travelled in India for a couple of months and met this Chinese woman who knew a guy who knew a guy who all came to a Silent Noise Party (DJs playing music that you can hear only in headphones, so everyone dances in the jungle without making noise). This vegan Belgian who lived there for years was there and we exchanged just a couple of random conversations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months later, I am in another country and he needs to leave his house, Facebook said, so I went to live there. The house came with a scooter and since we're in India, it doesn't matter that I don't know how to drive. The first week I'm alone in this new little village on the West shore of India, I decided to go to the next bigger village to buy food and stuff. Once I manage to understand how to use the scooter, I'm on my way and at the first intersection, everything came down at once: random guy in the middle of the street trying to avoid walking in cow shit, a couple of dogs, a couple of cows, rickshaws everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to make a quick decision and it's either I hit a cow or the random guy. Cows are sacred and, you know, animals, so I hit the random guy. I felt so bad I bought him a beer the same night and he turned out to be a really nice Scottish cook. We dated for a little while, until he left.   


After that I decided to take couchsurfers in my spare room and I chose the first one by his looks (shallow, sorry). He was just so handsome and we had so much in common so of course I wanted to meet him and, you know... maybe. And yes, we dated until he left as well. "

"We (my buddies and I) do talk about it like regular people. But we enjoy the big debates and discussing our own ideas. We like talking about what a dumpster fire the movies have become and what we would do differently and discuss the stories we would tell, given the ability to do so. And the thing is, we (they. My buddies. Not me. Ive given up.) go see the movies in hopes they're good. But every one seems like another disappointment. Even the original trilogy is soured for me. Thankfully, I'm an insufferable Star Wars fan and know more about the extended universe than any 'regular person' could hope to know.

But you know, I'm sure 'regular people' would just rip their hair out from how insufferable a group of friends discussing a shared passion is. Boy, what I would give to free myself of this cursed love and be a 'regular person'."

He had originally been my first and only attempt at having a one night stand and I was already nervous to have feelings for him so quickly. Figured he could forget it if he wanted to.

"Working at a restaurant, training a new hire. I could tell from the jump that she was a very sweet girl, but not terribly bright. At the time I had a few strands of my hair dyed green. She complimented it then asked me, ""How long did it take for your hair to turn that color?"" I was utterly baffled for a moment and said, ""Well...it's hair dye"" and got a ""Ooooh, ok. That makes sense"" in return. She thought my hair just spontaneously turned that color on its own, I guess?

Later I had to have her read through the employee handbook and kind of jokingly apologized for all the boring reading she'd have to do. She just laughed and assured me she was used to doing a lot of reading, as she'd been through medical school.

"We had been dating for 3 months and the end of the spring semester was coming up. I had gone out with friends to the bar and ended up at his place a little drunker then I was expecting. Skip to a few hours later, and we are in bed and I am hugging him and quietly crying about how I was going to miss him. (he was doing an internship in GA over the summer and I was going to be staying at school in VA) He hugged me back and said he loved me to which I proceeded to cry harder. I had a previous abusive relationship in the past where I thought I had loved my ex, but after our split was confused on if I had actually loved him or not. Basically I didn't trust my own emotions. In that moment I realized that I truly loved my BF and was so overwhelmed at this thought it made me cry harder.  

I cried for a few more minutes and then calmed down. We made plans to see each other over the summer and talked some more and then fell asleep. A few hours later, I woke him up, still drunk, and in a panic to tell him that I loved him too. He laughed and said he was only mildly worried when I cried harder after he said it. "

"If you have interest in any particular games that need a PS4 to play, you might as well get one now. For example, if you want to play Bloodborne or Persona 5 or whatever, then you need a PS4 to do it, and the existence of a hypothetical PS5 probably won't change that. Whether PS5 comes out in a year or 2 years or 3 years, you still need the PS4 today in order to play a PS4 game today. So ask yourself, do you know of any PS4 games that are worth it to you?       
  
On the other hand, If you still don't have enough reasons to buy a PS4 now, this many years into the console's lifecycle, then don't buy one hoping you'll find a reason to want it after the fact. I imagine if I were to buy a console today, I'd just have to pick some games at random to play, that I am not actually hyped about, so why would I bother? Just wait and see what the future brings, instead.

I was pulling into a parking area for a local hiking trail just as she was loading her backpack into her jeep at the end of her three day trip. She likes meeting people and so waited to chat with me when I got out of my truck. I also had my very friendly dog with  me who ran right up to her when I got out. 

We chat for just a few moments, but she was very pretty and seemed cool ( I haven't met many women who go on multi-day backpacking trips solo.) This trail has a sign-in sheet where you write down your vehicle type and tag number, in case you die and disappear. I paged through it and found her jeep with her name written next to it. At the risk of totally creeping her out, I looked her up on facebook and messaged her.

 A year-plus later we're still dating and I've never loved someone as much as her! Hard to believe that if I had just had to take a shit or something I would never have met her."

"At an airport at the help desk after our first flight was delayed and missed our connecting.

Turns out we lived in the same town, about 1/4 mile from each other. 

We had both been sent down by our individual companies to the same hotel for separate conferences. Everyone else in his group was able to get on a different flight after ours was delayed.

"By telling myself the only way i will feel better is if i do work. Definitely not the healthiest way to deal with it, but ive got one semester of uni left so it does the job for now. This helps because my depression and anxiety is caused by my perception of my own ""professional"" image, and i realized when I'm working its not as bad, because I'm being active in trying to change that perception of myself. That being said, some days i dont do anything then the self perpetuating machine that is depression starts working and i feel shit because im not doing anything then i struggle to get the energy to do something, then i just try to take a nap and tell myself i have to work when i wake up, then after my nap i try to work (not being very productive) and eventually the feelings subside and i start getting more productive.

"It'll be a process for sure and I think talking about it can help, but won't do it entirely. You may have to continue to get your feet wet and analyze what's going wrong in the relationship and be certain the other person is being untrustworthy or if it's the projections of your trauma. I don't say this invalidate your experience, but I also had to watch out for this in a couple relationships and potential partners. I saw that sometimes, it was my poor judgement in choice of person (rose tinted shades) and others was me being paranoid and accusatory and ultimately self destructive. And logically speaking, not everyone is going to have the mental distortions that your/my family has had. But, with you having been impacted so greatly I can imagine that making you very hesitant to even initiate, much as I was. I'm not sure about this so much as again, I haven't experienced that level/sort of thing... 

You don't trust your self? In what way? It can be difficult to trust others if you don't trust your self.. same with love. That one is even more difficult. It's hard to love someone purely if you don't love your self. 

I just started to enjoy being my self. Comfortable in my own skin, faults and all. So sharing these positive aspects of myself with others would bring me joy and happiness. I also started to enjoy others positive feelings as well, their good traits as sympathetic joy. Its kind of like, since I like myself, I was happy to express my self. I had gone quite a long time (and still do at times) without really expressing, anything really. Very, very withdrawn. 

I'm not sure which situations you're referring to what I was referring to. 

Yeah, I could see a difficulty expressing needs, seeing as you went most of your life without them being met or considered by the ones that are supposed to care and nurture you... I get a bit of that, as well. It's caused me to be very self sufficient, which can be very good but also isolating. In my relationship, I kind of looked for someone that could care for their self, as well, so we don't become too codependent on each other but choose to be with each other out of love/acceptance for each other. Good company, kind of thing. 

Yeah.. pretty much. That's a great analogy. I actually use like a sick, bedridden kid and a mother for that portion. Because.. traumatized kids and adults *are* injured. They've been hurt, they have scars.... Some are still open wounds. They must be tended to and cared for to be strong again. If there isn't anyone around in your childhood capable, you may have to do that your self. The internal father, so to speak, was also supportive and helpful. Patient and kind, but also encouraging. I created ""them"" by just imagining what sort of person that was like that would say in response to the troubles and suffering I faced. It was very helpful and sometimes it really released a lot of stress to where I would feel immense relief to the point of tearing up, because it made me realize how deprived I was as a kid. 

It's a shame but some women are attracted (magnetically, not necessarily physically) to that kind of injured person to take advantage of and control.  That can be difficult, but I believe when the right one comes along, you'll know. For me, it was like hearing shitty music my whole life and then hearing something beautiful. As if the cacophony was broken and I just felt like I knew. She was different. Different reactions and responses, different way of being and mental attitude. I've been with her nearly 4 years now and it's really been great. We've helped each other a lot. She understands poor family upbringing, too. It will help immensely when you start to heal mentally from these things. When I started meditating and seeing far more clearly my mental distortions, confusion and suffering and really started experiencing life in a more altruistic, peaceful way, then other people started being magnetized to me. It's strange, kind of like an equation we don't fully understand. When we start changing variables, the end result changes as well.

Fair enough. Well, you certainly aren't undeserving of it then. I really believe you have the potential to find what you seek. You may not know exactly how to do it, but with this kind of strong will to do so, you'll find your way but it won't be easy. You may have to wade through a lot of shit but it's worth it as I'm sure you can see the value of. "

"The US cannot be dethroned in terms of economy in the near future.  You have to understand that the US has something china wont have for at least a century.  That is a domestic population with significant disposable income.

China's economy will become larger in total, but to scale it will still export far more than it imports.  Without the US china would collapse completely.  without China the US would collapse, though not completely.  The world relies on these 2 economies being exactly where they are in order to maintain the growth.  Europe is the 3rd part of this equation.

Europe relies on US economic and military dominance so it is their best interest to support the status quo.  Unless china can offer them a better, and less threatening deal they will stick with it.

Sorry buddy, but the US military and economic dominance isn't going anywhere.  Also, China has a major revolution coming.  The people will not stand being repressed forever.  The more educated and worldly they become the more they will realize they are being manipulated by the state and oppressed compared to the rest of the world.

"I'm ""grilling"" you because you seem like an otherwise intelligent and levelheaded person who still is affected from the experience, and I understand. Things get messy when emotions are involved. I thought that it was evident in the way that you wrote about her that you were still hurt over how the relationship ended up and I was trying to get you to see why it appears that way to others.

The way you are trying to cover yourself by trying to convince me that there's no hurt or hate leftover from what happened just seems to enforce that you're still affected on some level. I'm not saying these things to attack or demonize you, my hope that was you'd reflect on why the relationship really went south. Since a relationship requires both people to work on it, and you seemed to put significantly more effort into it than her, you might have felt very unappreciated, and yes that sucks. She treated you like dirt after you ""broke her heart"" and that sucks. You tried to fix the relationship but it seems like she had abandoned ship the same night you had a bad reaction because of chronic pain. 

That's why you posted in this thread originally right? Because you felt like you were shot down super hard despite your best efforts to make it work.

I'm happy that you at least see the bright side about it, that your daughter is only in this world because of that relationship. But saying that you ""won"" in the end because she has a shitty boyfriend while you have your wonderful daughter is certainly spiteful in nature and does not reflect what you said here:

&gt;But no, i feel no spite toward her. Honestly i wish her the best, and I pray that she heals because I want her to do right by my baby

"Very random, but i love it! Sorry for the story. Phone finally kicked the bucket so I ended up going to Future Shop to buy a new one. The guy at the cell shop was super cute and there was definitely mutual flirtation going on, but nothing ever came out of it. I ended up having to go back the next day due to my phone not properly connecting to iTunes. Cell shop guy says 'that may take some time to figure out, i suggest going to the tech desk'.

Come back the next day with laptop in hand. Bring my phone and laptop over to the tech desk area to see if anyone can help me. The supervisor there (who looks at least 10 years older than me) looks it over to try to see if he can figure out why it's not connecting. I was probably there for about an hour with us both trying to figure out why it wasn't connecting.

We finally got it connected with all the songs actually showing up, but he tells me my computer is really slow and says he can take a look at why it's behaving this way.

Third time I bring it in (all free of charge), he sees me playing some game on Facebook. He goes 'hey, i play that too, you should add me'. End up adding him realizing he's almost 15 years older than me, and we end up taking to each other from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to bed.

"Sierra Nevadas, about 11 years old, back side, winter, riding an IT125 enduro (that I could barely touch the ground on), blizzard hit and I lost sight of the riders in front of me.  Blizzard was VERY sudden, got snow blind.  I tried to slow down, ended up sliding.  Controlled the slide, no worries, but the blizzard was so bad I did not know where the trail was and I felt I slid down the face of the hill I had been traversing, FELT like about 25 yards down.

Bike came to a stop and stalled.  I could not see.  I just sat there.  I knew the riders in front of me would ride for some time before they realized I was not behind them.  That moment, 20 miles from base camp somewhere in the lower mountains/foothills, was the loneliest I have ever felt.

The blizzard died off soon, I cheered up a bit.  I looked around, I had actually only slid about 30 feet below the ridge line that I knew would be the single-trail we were following, cheered up more.  I kick-started the bike, nothing.  I turned on the choke, it started, raced to turn the choke off, the engine caught good and was steady, I'm smiling at this point.  I managed to ride up the hill face to the ridge line and it was indeed the track.  I could see enough to know I was pointed the right way, based on the sun I was now overjoyed to see, so I carefully rode the ridge line and then got below the snow line within ten minutes.  I caught up to the riders and one of them said ""what did you do, take a crap?""  I told them what happened and they said ""oh shit, good thing you managed"" or words to that effect."

I don’t understand how 0% is a good rate of return? Car payments tie up your cash flow and prevent you from saving. That $200/BW payment at 0% is dead money. Depreciation eats the value of your car every day that you own it. Cars are machines that take you from one place to another. They are not investments. Better to buy/fix used and divert your payments into an investment that will do much more for you than buying new and overpaying.

"I know I'm a bit late, but I feel I need this.

1)First off, why is being a teenager so hard?? All these adults look down on you just because you're a teenager. I check my phone for one second, and suddenly I'm addicted. I'm lazy because I'm exhausted. I'm disrespectful because I'm trying to correct someone that's misinformed. It's ridiculous.

2) I'm South African, and we seem to have the worst luck with our rulers. My country has had 9 years of hell with our ex-leader (or should I say, ex-idiot) Jacob Zuma. We were happy when Ramaphosa was sworn in, and then suddenly he just slammed land reformation on us. It's awful! The exchange rate is getting worse and worse and it's all this guy's fault.

Thanks, I feel a tad better.

\[Edit\]3) My brother has autism, and I hate it. It's ruining my family. My parents are constantly irritated and barely get any sleep because my brother wakes up in the middle of the night, screaming. It's been like this for 9 years, it's awful. They're arguing more and more often, it's awful. I sound selfish when I say this but my brother's autism has really messed up my life. I was happy with my friends in America. I planned my future there. But then we decided to move back because my brother needed family support. I don't hate my brother, I hate autism. It sucks. My brother is 9 years old and has the mental capacity of a 3 year old. I thought by this time my brother and I would be gaming together and playing soccer or something. But no. Instead he screams when he's angry and can barely hold together a conversation.

And then you have these know-it-all people who recommend expensive treatments and medicines that DON'T WORK. Listen up: if you don't know what autism is please, please, PLEASE, do NOT recommend something that is utterly useless.

I'm sorry if this seems rude, I'm just speaking my mind."

I am being sarcastic. I love my job. I have a great relationship with my boss. She is awesome.
"I quit fb for two (personal) reasons:

1) My grandmother is a sucker for those obviously fake meme stories that always have some sort of political motivation. Some would call them “fake news” posts but half of it isn’t even news. Just random stories told with walls of text over weird meme images. She shared this stuff constantly. My cousins, aunts, parents and myself would always comment: “hey nana love u but this is fake”. I have one aunt in particular who made it her mission to disprove every one of these posts she shared. I was getting depressed seeing my nana fall for this bs. 
 And the second...

2) I have this one friend who is...quite strange. She is a good person and I love her but she just operates on a different plane of living lol. Anyway, she raises all sorts of different wildlife in her home and has a collection of eclectic animal and people friends lol. I can describe her human friends as a group of hearty, angry, opinionated goons that open fire on any fb post they deem wrong or controversial. This shit was filling up my TL daily. Post after post, comment after comment filled with vicious anger at people they don’t even know! Just because they are different from these people or have opposing opinions. And it never started as “debate” or “banter” it was charged, targeted harassment almost for no reason. 

Basically I gave up on he divisive atmosphere of FB. I didn’t care what my old high school friends doing, I liked the more anonymous nature of Reddit and twitter but I’m growing tired of those places too lol. When the Cambridge Analytica stuff came out it was just another sign telling me the platform wasn’t worth staying on anymore. "

"As a young girl I believed loosely in 'God', but my parents didn't really focus much on religion. After being sexually assaulted by my grandpa I went hard in the other direction and fucking hated religion, religious people, and the whole concept. This was 14 years ago.

Last year I lost a lot of people important to me, and my gf tried to comfort me by reminding me of the possibility of an afterlife. (I've stated before that reincarnation makes sense to me) but the problem is these are all just concepts I'd LIKE to believe. I can't actually say I understand that concept or feeling of faith. It's a scary thing, the idea of nothing after life, and I understand why people turn to religion, tbh. 

In the last year, I've really found that some Christian music really speaks to me from a ""wow, imagine being loved THAT much. Must be nice."" aspect. It's in the brief moment when I find a song I like that my anger gets lifted away and I get to glimpse a sliver of what I think faith must be like. 

I really doubt it will ever go beyond that glimpse, but it sure is interesting. "

I liked a guy that lived down the street from me freshman year, we took the same school bus. He asked me out over text (even though we were sitting right next to each other) because he was super shy. Then he asked me if he wanted to walk down to the lake and hold hands. We did so.

Next day he breaks up with me over text because people were making fun of him for dating me and he didn't want his image besmirched."

Not a single laugh or yell from the long ass line, total silence. Went and got into the backup club and had a way better time than expected. Never went back to that other shithole with unprofessional bouncers that don’t know how to handle bribes lmao."

Do you not see the discrepancy in these two sentences? If you dont, you have a serious misunderstanding of what polls do, and what the analysis of the polls said.


Nobody, and I mean Nobody, was saying that hillary clinton was going to have 90% of americans vote for her. If a single reputable pollster said that, they would not be a reputable pollster.

What the 90% figure meant, is that a donald trump victory was within the margin of error for the polling, but there was a 9/10 chance that it the actual results would fall towards hillary clinton.

There was a margin of error, and the polls fell within that, so the polling was accurate.

It’s close to 50/50, but it’s not actually 50/50, and there’s enough people in America that polls can say which side of the line it may fall on, with a confidence interval.

They basically said “The results going to be anywhere from 49% to 53%, with an even distribution. So it’s most likely to be 51%, but it could be anywhere within that interval. It’s a 9/10 chance that it’ll fall above 50%”

Most liberals I know dislike his policies for sure but taking those few liberals who are vocal about Trump being a facist is like equating all republicans as racists. You can't do that. I get the MSM pushes a narrative but it's disengeous to group all liberals together like we are some hivemind..

"I respect that and your experience, but I think the term “mania” can cover a number of different experiences, at least according to its psychological definition... I was always made to understand that my manic disorder manifested in paranoia/grandiose delusions in my depressive lows, then it used to cause similar delusions but also spurts of social or physical or otherwise atypical activity during the highs... once I figured out how to keep bad delusion at bay, is when the depressive mania wasn’t so monstrous and controlling... then I found I could actually take advantage of the positive swing of grandiose ideas, in order to motivate and convince myself I’m capable of doing things I’d never normally even attempt (as simple as going out and talking to a girl at the bar, or as bold as demanding a promotion, or at least making sure I was doing something productive)"

It's not a secret a lot of people live in California, not sure why you are trotting that fact out like you just discovered it?

In fact, less than 20% of the population lives in the 50 largest cities! Don't believe me? Look it up, the nice thing about facts are they are right whether you believe it or not.

"I have found the best way to get rid of fruit flies is to use a dust buster (or vacuum cleaner with hose attachment).  You see them buzzing around the fruit bowl or sink or whatever, walk up with the dust buster and just start sucking them right out of the air.  The ones that manage to escape usually scatter a little then quickly find a place to land like on the kitchen cabinets, window sills etc.  Now they're sitting ducks. Just take the dust buster to them again.  I have found I probably get 90% on the first round.  If I come back 2-3 more times, I've virtually gotten them all. Of course as somebody else pointed out this doesn't do anything to stop the life cycle if they have somewhere where they are laying eggs so that would still need to be addressed.  But it is very effective in stopping the immediate problem with a lot less hassle than making gross, unsightly traps that are only slightly effective."

Then I'd do nothing. It take some time to figure it out the best plan. I have no desire to be a billionaire, so this would come down to how this money could do the most good.

"I've wiped out ant colonies and would do so again. Once you see the Other as not one of your own, it's easy enough to do. You don't even need to justify it; nobody has to justify exterminating ratte, or untermenschen. Magneto wouldn't, in such a case, feel the need to justify exterminating humans. He's explicitly stated a few times he sees himself as a different species, and sees humans as homo sapiens saw neanderthals. The Other, and therefore morally inconsequential.

IOW, I don't think Magneto would (or has been portrayed as being willing to) wipe out swaths of mutants casually. Maybe he's done it, as part of his war, but I think he's at least *justified* it, in a way he never felt it necessary to justify killing humans.

And no, I don't think *I* would say that. But if I were Magneto and could wipe out all human life by snapping my fingers, *ensuring the safety of my species*? Not too hard to imagine doing it."

You are where you are, mate. That's a FACT. Now, the OPINION you have about the fact determines:
1: How much you'll enjoy it.
2: How efficient you will be at it.
I'm not saying it will be easy. It won't. It will be difficult. It'll break you. But IF you survive, man, you'll become a beast.

Not that it can be done in the snap of a finger, and you'll start to look at the silver lining of every cloud, and nobody's doing it cause they seek pity, or attention. Nobody's doing it because we don't know we can even try to.

You'll do good, man, believe me. If not today, maybe next month. Or next year. Or maybe 10 years from now. But you will do something so awesome that one day someone will make a movie on your life. But you must not ever give up. You must put a smile on your face, A REAL smile, one that comes from within. And you mustn't let it fade.

"&gt; Why is that?

a government regulation that regulated an older government regulation. Take them all away and watch companies offer the plans that will attract the most customers. Healthcare is so regulated right now that basically every company is forced to offer you the same exact stuff, most of which you will never use, not likely never use, actually never use. As a man included in your health insurance is the cost for you to get a mammogram, in a women's insurance is her routine prostate exam. Regulation inflates things, which is why they say if we completely subsidize health care it will be cheaper because it technically will be, but it will be just as cheap if we deregulate it.

&gt; That shitty company pays $4-500 on top of that. What if my job is truly shitty and keeps me part-time so they don't have to pay anything?

Listen I'm not trying to sound cold, but getting a full time job with benefits paying over minimum wage is not hard. If you Indeed search entry level or highschool level full time jobs, you will find a ton. Creating a society based around the lowest common denominator isn't smart. "

"Here's what you ask people who disagree: ""What is another gender other than male or female?""

I've yet to hear a good answer on that.

*Transgender* -- That's still binary. Going from one to the other doesn't suddenly create a third.

*Non-binary* -- That's not a gender, that's a description of your gender. Being male is binary, but no one has ""binary"" as their gender any more than anyone has ""non-white"" as their race.

*Bi-gender* -- Combining the two is still just having two, but now they're mixed. This isn't a new gender any more than being hyper masculine is its own gender.

*Gender fluid* -- Again, that's saying something about what type of gender you have, but not what the gender is.

*Agender* -- Not having a gender isn't a third gender either.

Now, there's more than two gender *identities*, and the two genders come in a ton of flavors, but I've yet to see someone explain what a third gender would even be."

"This is going to sound really heartless, but it's truly not meant that way.

*Note: this is based on the true definition and not the word play some have already used here...*

I am an ""extrovert"" (or as I like to call it ""normal""). I have no issues talking to someone, conversing, starting or ending a conversation.  I am freely able to talk to the hot girl, or stand up to my boss or any of the everyday simple things introverts sometimes cannot or choose not to do.

Someone else's problem is not my problem to solve. Just as my problems aren't yours, yours aren't mine.  This question assumes a position, one in which I have a responsibility of some sort to another.  That's false.  Being an extrovert is not a problem, being an introvert is (or can be). So from that perspective there is nothing I want or need to understand about an introvert or vice versa.  I do not have a responsibility to ""understand"" that perspective.

This question also assumes that being an extrovert somehow disadvantages an introvert, or being an extrovert somehow has an impact.  That's also false.  So as far as an introvert having something to tell me, for me to ""understand"", save it...

That said, being an extrovert is not really a ""thing"". I mean it's quantified as someone *more* outgoing than the norm, but the difference between that and normal/average is so much less than the distance between average and introvert. They are not really the opposite sides of a scale.

If I had to answer the second part of the question truthfully and as bluntly as possible, it wouldn't be about me or extroverts, it would be about them,  I would simply say the introvert should understand that it's all in their head.  No one cares as much about you, what you say or do, how you dress or act nearly as much as you think, nor do they judge you as harshly as you do. It's that simple.

"Not all Americans care about politics.

I’ll tell you this. I live an hour away from LA and once took the metro with friends to peacefully join the March for Immigration last year on a Saturday. We chanted and saw cool signs, it was nice to be part of a mass of people who cared about immigrants and refugees having a place to go to. Although the mayor wasn’t at city hall while the rally did its thing, a few weeks later the mayor of LA said that he welcomes LA as a sanctuary city, he also said that sanctuary city isn’t an official legal status either (it’s really a social construct, not official like whether a state is Red or Blue).

I follow the Facebook page for the LA Marches yet haven’t paricipated in another walk since. Why? I’m in my early 20s and broke. I’ve had jobs that required me to work Saturdays. I don’t like the idea of marching in the heat, luckily the weather was tolerable the one time I went. However I still keep up with news time to time and plan to vote this November. I also think in the long run it’s better if I get a stable career before I donate to nonprofits which support the causes I care about like education and animal care, because I have experiences working with nonprofits and it feels uplifting compared to the weekly Trump sucks scandals and clickbait news."

There would be no unplanned pregnancies, all babies would be  born  after a thorough and carefully consideration. The make up industry would be death pretty much instantly. The gyms would also close. Let's be honest most men work out not to be more healthy or stronger but to look better naked. Those ladies who are getting promotion, getting free stuff because of flirting or good looks would stop getting freebies. I guess women would see their role in society becoming better and worse at the same time. Those women who are good looking and using their good looks to increase their well being would see their quality of life drop dramatically and those ladies who are not good looking and see some sort of discrimination based on their looks would see an improvement of their lives. The way I see society as it is right now no one has as easy life as a hot chick and no one has as hard life as a ugly Betty. I mean that kind of scenario would be a great equaliser. "

They are usually started by scientists but need business people to make it work. Who gives a shit if you found a new cure for a specific cancer if it never makes it to market or if your company goes belly up because you’re bankrupt?

2) Go to grad school and get your Masters/PhD in biotechnology, molecular biology, etc. 

The truth is even if you got your bachelors in biology like you thought about, you wouldn’t be able to get any really good jobs. You could be a lab tech for a few years at a decent wage (mid 30k to mid 40k) but student loans would take up a bit, might be hard to get a mortgage, you might want kids — long term you might not be happy. 

I got my undergrad degree in microbiology and I came back to school. Most people have biology degrees but some have degrees in math or physics or other non life sciences. And especially if you apply to translational programs (aimed at taking academic ideas and “translating” them into practical therapeutics), admissions committees might really like your background in finance/business. Plus that probably means your quantitative skills are head-and-shoulders above most of these bio kids (myself included). 

So I would reframe your outlook to see how your skills fit into the bigger picture of things. Bio folks need accounting and financial leadership (path 1). Or you could be both, going between the science and the business side of things (path 2). Really having any bachelors degree is going to make you marketable as hell. I know some people like to say that having a college degree is overrated, student loans, etc, but it really sets you apart from non college educated applicants. And also it helps with networking (even just “where’d you go to school? oh we went to the same school!”). 

I would suggest talking to your academic advisor or an advisor in the bio school or to your campus’ career center. Express some of your concerns and see what they say. You might be surprised with their resources and who they can put you in touch with. Good luck!"

"I had fever plus making annoying coughing noises. I was in the middle of a school trip and there was no escape in a square. The teachers were keeping me there with huge 1000lb metal slabs. I was covering my mouth, I'm super polite.

Then this fat dude with an (I choose to recall it as a Hitler) mustache comes up and I'll add what my age was so people will hate on him. I was a wittle 13 year old. And he's like ""stop coughing, you sound like a dog barking, you're a fucking mess. If you need to cough, go the bathroom, and just because you decided to get ill doesn't mean you can get your spit and get snot and dirty germs on other people.""

Just in case people were suspecting, there was no snot involved.

I was like ""hmm... Never seen anything like this before.""

I was still contemplating his pudgy face as he turned around and left. Unfortunately no teachers were there. My friends gaped along with me, ""what a jerk!"" and I just went back to our hotel sad.

"&gt; Not two genders like bigender but a single distinct mix.

I think if the ""third"" gender is a mix of the two, I'd still say there's just two genders.

&gt;I also don't think there's a real reason to use the phrase ""gender identity,"" I don't really see how it is different than just saying ""gender.""

My reason is because gender is a complex, nuanced issue, and using simplified language tends to lead to people expressing simplified ideas, which often miss the point. I think it's especially important if these discussions are then going to manifest themselves in the form of laws or other policies.

So that's why I think there's a reason to use different phrases, but not what I think the difference is. I'd say your ""gender"" is like the hard fact that exists in the universe. Your ""gender identity"" is how you think about yourself. To use the race/ethnicity analogy, my ethnicity is a blend of Polish, German, and French Canadian (Cajun), but my ethnic identity is just white. There's some fact about the origin of my DNA, but I don't really think of myself in those terms.

And just to muddy the waters some more, there's also your ""gender expression,"" which is how you present yourself to the world, the way you perform your gender. And there's your ""gender role,"" which is how the world wants you to express your gender.

&gt;when we get pissed at someone claiming there are 2 genders it's because they're almost universally doing it to say that non-binary people don't exist

Concur in part, dissent in part, and concur in the holding.

I think a lot of the people saying there's only two genders are doing so to provoke people who fall outside of the cishet gender conforming norm. Or more likely, to provoke the allies of those people (because there's a lot more of them, and they tend to be vocal and easily provoked).

On the other hand though, I think there's also people who say they're non-binary who have gotten it wrong. For instance, I know a couple people (actually, I think everyone I know who identifies as non-binary is in this camp) who reject their gender *role* and because of that say they're non-binary. And just to make things even weirder, they still take a traditional gender expression, and what they're actually objecting to is that the role exists. They want to be fairly traditionally masculine or feminine, but just reject the idea that they're expected to be that way. ...Well that's not a gender, that's a political belief.

What I mean is that they don’t put money towards it via work.

I pay around £40 a month for it no matter what, whether I use the NHS or not. A fair few migrants that come here live on benefits which us working citizens pay for which is another deduction on top of NI. So they come here, live for free in a decent house on benefits that working citizens pay for. So Brexit will help that massively. We don’t have travel insurance through tax, we just get it when we go away somewhere. Our tax covers councils, police and the general running of the country which goes towards people on benefits."

"This happens far more than you'd think, and not to as stupid of circumstances.

I owned a small tech company that got bought out, and then later subsequently sold (while I was still a principle) to a much larger company.  The tax shenanigans are fucking insane and stupid.  16 year old me was supposed to know when founding a ""company"" how to optimize taxes 10 years later.  Seriously this is the expectation, and people called me dumb at age 25 for not organizing the original structure of the company more efficiently a decade previously.

I have despised taxes and tax law ever since being utterly fucked by the simple fact I didn't know in my teens to hire a tax attorney when incorporating.  Prior to that event I was very much the ""man if I make a million I'll totally pay every dime of taxes with a smile on my face!"" type.  Then I saw folks who played the system pay a tiny fraction of what I did playing it naively, while doing an order of magnitude less actual work."

"The general consensus on what is ""moral"" is a means for maintaining order in the global community, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It needs to be perceived as the only way things should be done most of the time, however being able to bend or ignore morality when it suits you is very freeing. As such preaching the concept of ignoring morals in favor of selfish enjoyment is not something I endorse, however when someone does something ""immoral"" I couldn't care less (such as cheating). I just see getting caught breaking rules which go against conventional morals as a failure in terms of strategy, not personal integrity, and as something which is the problem of the perpetrator, (be it myself or others), not something I or anybody else should bother themselfves with.

Summary: I dont care if you dont like people cheating, I dont care if cheating makes you think im a bad person. The path of least resistance is the most natural to take, and I wont shame anyone for doing so. "

Have you ever once considered learning a different viewpoint to challenge your own? That's what his entire podcast essentially is. These right wing people he brings on engage Joe in a very unique conversation so he can sort out their world view. He claims frequently to be a liberal but is constantly engaging with people in a way that allows them to speak ideas clearly and he can and often does interject when something they say cuts against his world view. His talk with Ben Shapiro (a friend made me listen to it) radically opened me up to ways I've never thought before and as a result I have much more rounded view of the world than I've ever had. It's important to learn the nuance of other people's arguments so you can form your own.

I agree with taxation, but your argument is flawed. Also, I can empathize with the people saying that this specific case is unethical. Can you really say that it's fair to tax someone for more than their net worth over something that they clearly didn't understand? I don't think that a bit of leniency would destroy the fabric of society.

Final argument, and I realize I'm laying it on a bit thick here: Wouldn't you feel unfairly treated if you were massively in debt due to laws you were not informed about? Remember that many people in this country never receive formal education regarding capital gains taxes, and those that do tend to forget the details because they don't expect to ever be in such a situation. Just imagine being in debt over something you didn't know about."
"If you really can't see how, you're an idiot.

"So let me try see the argument you're raising.

Stain is a villain that advocates for true heroism. He does so by killing heroes that, from his perspective, aren't heroes at all. Hence they're false heroes. In killing these false heroes, he believes all false heroes will quit and only the true heroes will remain. True heroes are those that seek to save people for no benefit or external reward. False heroes are those that have perverted the nature of being a hero by allowing themselves to be caught up in all the politics and glamour of it. Ultimately, he wants to dismantle the hero establishment as it currently is.

According to your argument, Endeavor is the epitome of a false hero. But Stain wouldn't go after him because he'd be outmatched. Uwabami is also a false hero/icon but Stain also wouldn't go after her because she's surrounded by too many innocent people, and he doesn't kill innocent people.

Ingenium is also supposedly a false hero because, despite what we learn about him from Lida, his brother is probably biased. Therefore, the Ingenium we see is not the true Ingenium. The true Ingenium is also probably a false hero.

Am I right in saying this is more or less what you're arguing?"
**HELL YEAH**

"Sure, many things can be explained in other ways as not everything (anything) in the MCU is consistent, but we have a few references about how strong the Hulk is, and some parts do not add up. At the very least the Hulk is a lot more stronger than Captain America, and Cap holds his own against Thanos better than the Hulk does.

Even if he remembers what happened on the ship with Thanos he would not know that much about him. I can hardly imagin Hulk sitting through a debriefing from the asgardians, while Loki likely knows all what Bruce talks about.

Loki is still a master of deceit, I don't remember clearly how those scenes played out when he was wrestling internally, but Loki could have faked them to sell himself better and not draw suspicion.

There is also no good explanation for why he can not turn into the Hulk anymore."

"Meh; as much as I despise Apple as an IT guy for how much they control their stuff and make it hard to work on my own computers... I've come to loathe Android for basically turning into a worse iPhone.

Firstly, I hate touch screens and want a phone with buttons again. I realize I'm not winning that battle, but I was a Blackberry holdout for ages before finally jumping off that sinking ship.

But then when I went to Android phones, it was because there were certain things like customizability and the ability to remove your battery that made me like it (for those of us playing at home: being able to remove the battery can 1: make it easier to repair rather than replace the phone, since that's the part that is going to fail more reliably over a couple years, and 2: in case you don't like everything you say running through NSA databases, as long as the phone receives power, the microphone can pick up what you're saying).

But now the only difference, really, is that apps on iOS are coded in Objective-C for a dozen different hardware profiles, while Android apps are coded using Java for thousands of different hardware profiles. The fact that iOS has a C-family language powering it's apps typically results in cleaner apps that run better (and their control over their hardware helps with that too), and so... yeah. Put all that into the ads, and there is still a damn good reason to buy an iPhone.

Or just say that it runs Pokemon Go better. That'll get a decent chunk of people."

its no guarantee because nothing is. but neither was the golden ticket, the golden ticket was a chance at something better, not an automatic success.

"First of all, I appreciate the advice and support that doesn't come across as hostile and blaming. 
Second, I work 30+ hours a week on top of high school. I struggle with money because of various family members ( complicated situation that I won't detail here) and hospital and ambulance bills that were my own fault, so I try to refrain from complaining about them. 
Third, I'm not entirely sure you've struggled with an addiction before, as ""stop smoking until you can afford it"" doesn't strike me as something someone who knows what addiction is like would say. Sorry if I'm wrong about that.
I've been working since I was 12. I'm not a lazy person who doesnt want to get a job. I'm in a difficult situation with various financial difficulties that are unsolvable right now. I have a costly addiction that I wish I didn't have, but I need a coping mechanism to keep me sane, and trying to quit now would only set me up for failure. I'm trying to get through it in my own way,"

"It is inevitable that if a government grows to such a size, the wrong person will eventually get their hands on the reigns. Lenin was bad enough, but even if a peerless, Jesus-like figure had been in his shoes, he would have eventually been knocked off and replaced by the wrong person. Government is a powerful weapon, and people lusting after power are ruthless. *“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Fœderal Government are few and defined.”* 

The American Founding Fathers understood this, and sought to create a system where power rested in the hands of the people and individual states. A decentralized experiment—like multiple Petri dishes, each adding whatever variables they felt necessary to govern their own state—all operating under the umbrella of a few specified ground rules and the promise of a united federation that could come together in times of external threat to provide for the common defense of the right to operate with such freedoms. We have slipped dangerously towards centralized, authoritarian control where the Federal Government has become hopelessly bloated, corrupted by money and power, saddled with debt, and seemingly responsible for providing *everything,* from education, to welfare, to healthcare. We are lumbering foolishly in the direction of Leninism and Stalinism, driven by the whips of the ignorant.

It kind of works but often is completely tone deaf, like when Moss (ostensibly your protagonist) dies offscreen without any fanfare. "

So for that reason, I'm going to be 100% honest with you, standing at work is completely worthless. Don't fucking fool yourself into thinking it makes any difference, because it really doesn't. Diet is 75% of the battle. Workout is the other 25%. Oh, you have a standing desk but still eat 3 meals out before you go home and have another meal delivered to you? Guess what? You're going to be a fat piece of lard. And what's that? You work your ass off in the gym and make your own food when you go home? Doesn't matter if you stand or sit for you eight hours of conscripted office work. In fact, your joints will be happier if you actually let them rest.

Also, a living wage? How is that a Democrat thing? What, you gonna make companies pay more for people to still live beyond their means? Maybe you should look at the root cause, first, before trying to label that issue with a partisan label. All a wage increase does, is make goods and services cost more, eating up what wage you thought you were going to get.

The news around this is changing very quickly, so it's really difficult to say what will be the end result, who will end up testifying and exactly when, but this is not a matter of political expediency. No reputable news outlet has published a claim that she will not testify ever. The only stories that have broke have said she wants an investigation first. That doesn't mean she won't testify, so I don't accept that claim that you make that she simply ""won't"". 

A supreme court nominee is being accused of attempted rape. That's what we need to investigate. All I'm saying is that we can't brush it under the rug, which is what a lot of senators and representatives are trying to do right now. 

There are also many tools to investigate this that are at the disposal of the United States Senate. Let's stop pretending that they are incapable of doing anything but ignoring all of the allegations and rushing the nomination through.

"Really? From someone so passive aggressive? Every time I hear a teacher complain I think... How could we get teachers out of education?

Our education system is a joke and the main contributing party just sits around an whines about it. They don't organize themselves, they don't standardize themselves, they don't measure themselves. I've never heard a teacher say they didn't know something, or investigate a solution. They go on and on about how difficult parents are and how horrible correcting is, how it's impossible to teach to such a diverse group. But never once have I heard a solution, or even an idea proposed. Meanwhile half of our best minds have to imported from other countries. 

Do I want to pay teachers more? Absolutely. Do I want them to have smaller class sizes. Sure. Have amiable conversations with most parents, that would be great! But alas, I, nor anyone else can do those things for teachers. They must justify higher wages, more professionals and a productive dialog. That is part of being a professional. 

So, to be clear: I am not angry with teachers, I am disgusted, disappointed, and saddened by them. Such a noble cause taken up with such an ignoble attitude. 

Let me put it a different way. When in one breath someone tell me that the studied for almost a decade and became an expert in communicating new ideas to large diverse groups of people. And they can't even negotiate a raise, hold a conversation, or even someones attention. I lose all respect for them, and any compassion they might have otherwise gotten."
"For me, it was either the Babadook or It (2017), Babadook sent me into a panic attack thought loop in which I was in my bathtub crying, rocking myself back and forth with the water running screaming “that’s not me” on repeat.  That was in 2015. 

It, after seeing it with my wife, also sent me into a panic attack in which I had hallucinations of Pennywise following me everywhere. I broke in my car in a local food market screaming “Leave me alone” over and over. I knew full well it wasn’t real and that it was just a hallucination, but that just added to my fear of clinical insanity, thus making it worse. It got to such a point that, when i had to drive home, my wife had to aid me driving  just to get home. Yay me :/

You claim its man is penis and woman is vagina and XX and XY.

So like i said

Xx is one

Xy is two

The other arrangements make 3+

Penis only is male 

Vagina only is female

"Game of thrones has done nothing but grow in the later seasons. To argue that it “wasn’t good” in later seasons when its audience has ballooned during them is pretty laughable. It played correctly to audience expectations of grandeur. Star Wars was very similar in this regard. If you’re not going to like something just because it played to a bigger audience than the tiny one you wish it gave more attention to, you can suck it up and realize that’s how it works when directors are aiming to maximize ticket sales.

Again, I didn’t bring up other changes and it’s quite appropriate to complain about things like the “Rey download” issue. That’s a big change and goes against literally half of Empire Strikes Back. But complaining about healing rates being changed, as I initially argued, is an exceptionally pedantic and silly thing to declare as “destroying” Star Wars lore."

A side note, how you feel doesn't say anything about large-scale trends because tons of people feel better after placebo and discover nothing was done to them (and they can be mistaken as to why the improvement occurred). There is no rigorous science that backs up any of chiropracty's claims, and if a medical practitioner tried to do stuff with this level of testing they would lose their license (for a very good reason)."

He definitely hasn’t done anything that’s actually fascist, despite repeatedly expressing a desire to do fascist things.

Basically at what point do you say no to poor people and have them work for themselves? I don't know the answer, just food for thought, everyone has their 'limit' in that regard, so to speak. I had never even considered it before. I've also come to realize a lot of people on the right aren't against charity, they're against government handouts. Most people are better taken care of by private institutions than government programs (think YMCA/RedCross/Salvation Army versus the VA). But regardless, nice to share views with someone rational.

1973, Trump violated fair housing act by refusing to rent to blacks

1992 Trump lost an appeal because he was fined $200,000 for removing dealers at his casino specifically because they were black

1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump's Castle, accused another one of Trump's businesses of discrimination. ""When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor""

1991: A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant: ""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control."" Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that ""the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.""

It's not the worst ending ever, but it's the most bullshit because it did more damage to a great film than anything I've seen otherwise.

I know lots of people like it, but I thought it made no sense. I get it - she's cold and logical, and she's supposed to be doing the most logical thing, regardless of morality. I understand what the point was. I just don't think that was the most logical thing to do. She has no way off the property without him (which gets weirdly glossed over when they show her getting on the helicopter, because I guess the pilot didn't ask why he dropped off a red-haired man and is now picking up a brunette woman?), she has no identity, no shelter, nothing. A man who was that desperately falling for her, who has already that stuff and who she could manipulate like a puppet? She could have used him. He was still of value.

I understand the point was to drive home that she would do whatever made the most sense, regardless of morality, but all it did for me was roll over from being amoral to being immoral. She wasn't doing the thing that made the most sense. They decided to drive home that she's not human by making her spiteful instead of making her just coldly logical. I know they didn't want her having positive emotions that clouded her logic, but you can go too far in the other direction. She acted against her own best interest and it wrecked everything."

"""Creepy"" isn't really an argument against something except when you're trying to score social points. Whether it's good or bad should be what we're interested in. The bad is that loyalty to one's country can be bad if the country behaves badly. However, this can be mitigated by notions of loyalty to ideals or systems rather than to specific people or policies. The good is that loyalty to one's country can be good if one's country undertakes good actions, and that fostering a general sense of prosociality among sometimes very different individuals within a country often leads to better behaviors.

I don't think socializing children to have a group identity as citizens of a certain country who are loyal to that country's institutions is bad. It would be bad in the context of a bad country, but that doesn't make it bad everywhere. A lot of the people who criticize the pledge seem to not believe in the value of allegiance in general, let alone in the specific instance of patriotism, which is where a lot of their unease comes from."

"I'm sorry this happened to you, but I guess people can have multiple motivations, people have sex with sex dolls too, they don't derive pleasure from power over them, right? 

And to be clear, I don't compare anybody especially rape survivors to sex dolls, but that's how psychopaths would consider their victims. I can imagine rapists who don't give a shit about what the person they rape thinks, therefore they could not care about the power aspect because that would mean they would care about what the person they rape thinks/feels, it seem to me that (if my initial assumption about how psychopaths operate) that the power aspect would simply be inconsequential to them. 

On the other hand I can also imagine rapists who are all about the power and control and possible derive pleasure from other people's suffering. So there you go, as long as you don't claim ""it's *only* about power"" I give you that you are at least partially right. However, personal anecdotal experience, while powerful to you doesn't cover all the possible cases and causes. My reaction is mostly against generalizations and blanket claims."

"It has smoother gameplay because their characters are cartoons and the gameplay consists of squating, jumping, and building and 3rd person scoping which are both shit. There’s not a lot to work on. If you lower your gameplay quality of course there will be less problems that are easier to work on. PUBG Has more to the gameplay that makes it more interesting tactically speaking and your character doesn’t look like it belongs in loony toons. If there wasn’t building in fortnite I would’ve had so many more wins.

"I *love* studying the origins of words. Most of the words in the English language can be traced back to Latin, but some of our commonly used words are much more recent, because the actions or items those words mean didn't exist back then! Like how we didn't have the word ""Phone"" until phones existed, but it is based off the word ""Phonetics"". 

My favorite example of this is the word ""Running"". The word ""running"" wasn't invented until 1702 when a man named Charlie Running accidentally tried to walk twice at the same time. "

"The twist was tropey and mundane. A straight up mystery/horror film would have been much more surprising in the twist-ridden days of modern cinema. To me the twist was obvious from the trailer, from the ""it takes place in an insane asylum"" bit of the premise. It's the most obvious twist since... Well I honestly can't think of a more obvious one. The Good Place was close (obvious from the premise/Netflix blurb) but it was at least entertaining despite the obvious twist. The only part of Shutter Island that was interesting was the idea of abuse/human experimentation by a mad doctor at an insane asylum, the rest was just boring. Yeah there are hints woven throughout that it's not real and it's a well made film but it's like you made a film about aliens invading and hinted at how cool and different and interesting the aliens were but in the end it's all just hallucinations from DTs and a metaphor for alcoholism. Introducing an interesting, outlandish idea just to shove it aside for a boring, everyday one for the sake making the movie have a twist, bleh.

It all points to the issue of systemic racism. The fact that black people are generally poorer is because their parents and grandparents have been denied jobs and housing because they were black.

&gt;Giving tax cuts to the rich.

Look at the bigger picture here. Maybe they are getting tons back because they already pay the most in taxes? I know, radical idea. 

&gt;Since the rich pay the most in tax, most breaks will naturally give the greatest dollar amounts to them. Partisans will use that fact. But on a relative basis, the likely changes will offer a lot to middle class Americans, in some ways more than the wealthy will get. Here are five major ways likely changes will impact the middle class and five major ways they will affect those toward the top of the income distribution.

Also thinking you have government control is a joke. All it takes is one wrong election for a dictator to come in and take control. The more power the government at that time the easier it is. 

The amount you pay in taxes basically equates to how much control over your life you give to the government. 60% tax rate means 60 percent of every dollar you make you are giving to them to do what they want with. It doesn't leave you with much to work with on your own."

"So I voted leave mainly to save the NHS. In a non-racist way, the migrants are using the NHS for free and not paying any National Insurance (which funds the NHS) and they go for things that can be treated at home with a few days rest and over the counter medicines. I also voted leave to get out the claws of Brussels. We are controlled by them and have no say in how to run our country.

Things lost in this the big one, free travel around Europe but that doesn’t affect me because I can get an Irish passport and keep that privilege (ha!). Other thing lost include the single market, but that is also a point gained to Brexit. As we leave the single market, we can trade internationally and not just purely around Europe. In a sense, we have to buy and sell to other EU members more than outsiders.

So in summary, we get our NHS back (it’s now rundown or getting rundown as we speak), we lose the free travel and single market but we gain international trades and trying to strike a deal with USA, Canada and India. 3 big economies outside the EU."

As to my “emotional capital”, which I’m aware is a pretty dumb description, but it made sense, you’re right, that doesn’t get my company anything, but it doesn’t cost them anything either and I’d rather be in a good mood at work. 


What does cost the company, and is one of my responsibilities to prevent, is stopping your work, which is being timed down to the minute, to talk about why a customer chose “such a dumb build”. It’s because some advisor or CTO or salesperson recommended the hardware for the application. The customer then paid, so how about we just put the fucking thing together? 


I get how I seem callous, and I’ll be the first to admit that I am, and it’s because my job, or role therein, used to be better. Fewer responsibilities, more desire to participate, willing to mentor people- the whole thing. 


But then I just stopped caring. All we do, and all a tech hobby really boils down to, is paying some enormous quasi-anonymous multinational conglomerate for bits and pieces of hardware that they have a monopoly on that you use to ignore the outside world for a few hours at a time. These same enormous conglomerates produce their products at best using unskilled rural labor that moved to manufacturing cities for a shot at a better life, and at worst kids. 

Then you give them thousands of dollars a year for heir hardware to have the latest or the newest or the best cpu or graphics card. And then you do it again the next year when they change the tech or the form factor. It makes no sense to me anymore and I’m lost even thinking about it now, of course I’m miserable at work.

"The same thing occurred amid the news of widespread grooming of young white girls by ""Asian"" men. It was eventually brought to light that these ""Asians"" were not only targeting white girls, but also young girls from Hindu and Sikh communities. Since these ""Asians"" of Pakistani heritage are targeting white, Hindu, and Sikh children, and Pakistan is 96 percent Muslim, wouldn't a more accurate description be ""Pakistani Muslim men""?

Another good example would be how the UK tabloids reported on the ""Asians"" who spat on Remembrance Day poppies and the girl who was selling them. The only ""Asians"" who are offended by poppies, which they see as a reference to soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc., are Muslims, but this is not mentioned in the report. So, again, the use of ""Asian"" to describe the perpetrators behind these crimes is inaccurate because their race was irrelevant to their motivations.

"The Republican party is fiscally conservative and has a focus on ""traditional"" values. People seem to brush off the fact that the Democrats have always been for the same traditional values, only ceding some as a campaign tactic.  Obama was staunchly against gay marriage.  Many Dems were and some still are against abortion.  Honestly, the population is more divided into party lines than the actual politicians in the parties.

If you want to demonizes the GOP, don't put blinders on and ignore the Democrats.  The Democrats campaign on gun control and socialized health care and improved living conditions for minorities, but then when they're in power they do very little to pass that legislation.  Those are the selling points and without them, they'd have a lot less to campaign on.  If you think the Democrats are any different from the Republicans, you haven't been paying much attention to the whole scope of the news in the past decade.  Get your head out of late night shows like Colbert, they've become puppets.   I'm generally liberal btw, I just realize that the Democrats and Republicans are both liars and the enemy isn't the conservative people for having their own opinions on matters important to them.

Also, if go thinm the Republicans are against discussion, what about people like you (that are now rampant in the left unfortunately) that use some community forged general morality to shut down any discussion.  Should we keep saying gay people are born that way when all of the evidence points to environmental factors?  Yes, because gay people should be championed above science says the left now.  Is it ok that a 14 year old can be portrayed in TV making a life changing decision like gender reassignment therapy despite every other decision if that nature having to be made once you're deemed mentally mature enough (18-21)?  Apparently, because what's more important than protecting children who are still learning and finding themselves is coming across as progressive to the extreme says the left.  

And there's a good chance that you'll either not read past the first point in that last paragraph or call me anti-gay or anti-trans because I tried to have a discussion and that instantly stops the discussion.  I'm not anti-gay, in fact one of my best friends in the world is gay but he accepts that it was due to environmental factors in his developing stages early in life.  In the same vein, I'm not anti-trans, but I think life altering steps like gender reassignment therapy should be reserved for the most extreme cases if medically they cannot wait, otherwise it should become available at the age of adulthood like everything else of the same kind."

"Its sorta a mystery though. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which does not typically manifest as paranoia. The medication she was on for bipolar could without a doubt cause changes in her behavior but she was on a low dose according to her family. A few friends and family members also stated that she had taken herself off the medication before and did not have paranoia or paranoid symptoms. 

If I can find the links ill provide them, I read them the last time her case was mentioned in ask Reddit. "

"Your first paragraph doesn’t make sense, also studies have shown factually IQ does differ between race, that’s a fact whether you like it or not. Harvard even raised the bar for Asian students because they were fucking killing it, and lowered it for minorities. 

Not that I think the IQ test is necessary the best tell of intelligence, but we can’t ignore the fact that certain cultures really prioritize education, and others look down on it.

Shapiro is a Jewish Conservative... from what I’ve heard makes the point that Trans suicide rates are crazy high - 40% range with or without surgery. He doesn’t like gerrymandering to them. I think he sees it as similar to psychosis, I think he had a grandfather with schizophrenia that thought the radio was talking to him. 

Haven’t seen anything about native Americans or Muslim’s, although he is critical of the religion (rightfully so).

If you’re claiming that you spotted *all* of those things on your *first* time watching that fight, I’m sorry but I don’t believe you. No one is able to pay that much attention to every little detail of the fight to the point that they can keep track of every single weapon being swung around *while* their brain is also processing the actual events of the movie for the very first time."
well one thing we know for sure is that people never go on reddit and make stuff up for upvotes
"Well I’m afraid I don’t believe you. I don’t believe you can keep track of all of these different things happening at once. There are like eight weapons being swung around on screen simultaneously and you’re telling me that you managed to keep a close eye on *all* of them at once while processing the actual events of the movie as well? Nah I don’t think that’s possible.

Good for you if you did, but I don’t believe it one bit. At most I can believe people picking up the Kylo ground stab, which is admittedly a bit weird, but then we also have similarly weird moments like Kenobi/Anakin’s saber twirling competition mid-duel, Kenobi’s random spin against Vader which I mentioned before, etc. So again I don’t find TLJ to be alone on that front."

"I don't understand how you can stand to live your lives at the utter mercy of corporations. It sounds like your health insurance, housing and your children's educations depend entirely on your job, and these are fundamental things you need in a modern society. If you're in a job without strong union protections, doesn't it mean that you will accept more and more bullshit from companies because the fear of losing your job is greater?

Corollary to the above, I don't understand how you are so suspicious and fearful of the average government employee or politician, but will happily put your lives in the hands of a corporation. At least the former is theoretically accountable to the public. 

Yes free market, but the free market in a large city with plenty of jobs available is going to be dramatically different from a mid-sized town with entire industries going bust. And it's not as if it's easy to uproot and take a job in another city or state."

"~~You wanna talk about placing blame but that's exactly what your doing when you talk about how China has crazy emissions, without even thinking about the source of those emisions.~~

Edit because i feel like this part read as too aggressive given the context. I got ahead of myself and I didn't mean to convey that. 

When it comes down to it, placing blame isn't going to solve any problems. What needs to happen is that we need to evaluate the sources of pollution, and then evaluate the sources of those sources until we reach a reasonable method of change. Part of this is China's fault for obvious reasons - too much unnessacary trash, unsafe dumping of resources. But a larger part is Western Materialism, in that it is the entire reason the market exists in the first place. Finding a common ground between change in China and cultural change in the West is the idea I wanted to push.

 If you want a solution then its as simple as stop buying so much stuff and start teaching your kids and friends the same. Basic supply and demand tells us that if we ask for less then less will be produced.

We can't ethically and morally change China's laws and business practices (within short amounts of time) without both causing huge ethical concerns about how we do that, and two causing huge problems in our home markets as supply for our products goes into the toilet.

 If you were to somehow make China follow pollution and production laws of say Sweden then you would also cause a huge unstable market and void waiting to be filled by other lackluster countries (solving nothing), or manually create the hugest ecomonic depression the world has seen."

"One thing lacking from this conversation about Americans is how competitive we are. Americans are extremely competitive. We have professional sports leagues in American Football, Baseball, Basketball, Hockey and Football (soccer). Besides professional sports teams you have many, many amatuer sports in leagues, Universities, and high schools. Some Sports on a college level are probably close to a professional level in other countries. I think the exceptionalism and hyper patriotism derives from this base of extreme competitiveness. Probably also part of why are politics has become so partisan as well."

The movie had plenty of time to solve the main issues facing the protaganists, instead it pulls a deus ex machina and solves it all with a literal blackhole... The only reason this movie even got seemingly good reviews was because it was hyped and its director is Nolan. And I enjoy some of Nolans other works, but he really dropped it with this one.

Sure, I liked the sci-fi technology, and physics. But the story didn't captivate me or make sense. I mean already from the start we see an Indian UAV crashing as if it means something significant. It doesn't, and the movie just continues. Also they mention Earth is dying... and all it does is show some corn fields in drought and blight."

"Nothing you listed is unique to Europe aside from the historical aspect so yes, because geographically we're connected we share one history. Obviously different states have different geographical landscapes so that is also not unique to Europe.

Different states have different healthcare. In fact Mitt Romney ran his campaign on the fact that his state's healthcare should be used as the basis for a Federal healthcare system. Each state's schools vary widely not just on a public level, but also including the availability of charter or private schools. Justice systems are also different, the biggest example of which is capital punishment (death penalty) which is not the same in all states.

Different references? You really think that there's no such thing as hometown heroes or local celebrities on a state level? Unless somebody makes national news for something there are always going to be local people that are renowned in the state, but outside the state no one has a clue who they are. This aspect of the culture is even parodied in shows like Parks and Recreation.

As I stated before personal values, morals and values (again?) can vary widely even between counties let alone states. In fact the whole political system of America is set on this basis and politicians pander to their base which is why you have ""red"" and ""blue"" states.  


So if you're basing your opinion on the fact that all Costcos (who have a unified branding) are the same then yeah that's the same. But ask the average Californian about WaWa and they won't know wtf you're talking about. Even Carl's Jr has a different name depending on which state you're in (Hardee's anyone?). While America does its best to assimilate foreigners and make them part of the US identity, becoming American doesn't mean losing your heritage or culture. It means sharing it.

"&gt; not doing deals with obvious criminals

This undermines our entire legal system and the presumption of innocence.  Clyde is extremely short-sighted in thinking that any one person can or should be the arbiter of guilt for an accused criminal.

Clyde knows the defendant is guilty, but justice isn't about what *you* know, it's about what a fair process can prove to society to jusify society punishing a person for a crime.  

Every imprisonment, evey execution - we are all tacitly complicit as citizens whether we like it or not, and we'd prefer not to be roped into some psychopath's revenge fantasy if the evidence isn't there.

"Many years ago I was subbing a high school English class, right at the beginning of the year. 
These two kids, names were Chris and Blake I think, teenage boys with longish hair and jean jackets, sat across from each other and every day from the first day they would draw or write something on their notebooks and show it to each other and giggle. Then they started passing the notebook back and forth, each would scrbible something then hand it back to the other who would giggle and scribble something else. This is pretty much all they did in class, sometimes they acted like they were paying attention but is was mostly just the notebook-scribble-pass-giggle-scribble-pass over and over. I know it's hard to get back on track after summer break, I was a teenager once too. 
After a week of this disruption I said out loud ""hey, guys, summer is over. School is now in session"". They both nodded and listened the rest of the day.
Next day, it was the notebook again. I was becoming increasingly agitated....
Another week of this and the class was paying more attention to Chris and Blake and their notebook passing that they were to me, the lessons, their textbooks, any reason they actually had to be in my class. I was now calling out the entire class at regular intervals, threatening them all with 3 hours of detention, that day...
I was bothering me so  much that they were disrupting my very thoughts as well.
One day  The Notebook ritual started up and I.Fucking.Lost.It.
Leapt up fom my desk and stormed down the aisle to Chris, the current proprietor of the THE NOTEBOOK.
He was currently scribbling and I pulled it right from beneath his pen. I swear the blue line dug across the surface with the sound of a record needle being drug across the grooves. But no matter.
I had THE NOTEBOOK, source of my torment, and was determined to find what evil...nay, DEMONIC power it held over Chris, Blake, the entire class, and now me.
I looked at the dread object for the first time..
T'was but a blur, had forgotten to put my readers on...
Whipped the spectacles from my pocket like a well trained swordsman preparing for a dual and placed them onto my face in the most scholarly-yet-resentful way my shattered soul could muster.
And there it was. Drawing's of penises. Hundreds of them. Some were alone in the corner. Others together in groups. And there was a...a...chain of dickbutts. Connected to each other like a dickbutt-centipede that went round-and-through, over-and under. And in different color pens. And obviously not drawn by only Chris and Blake, the entire class had been participating! Each segment had a little thought bubble that said ""I'll blister your ass""
!!!!!
Already in the throes of madness, I held up THE BOOK OF PENIS to Chris and started screaming at him.
""What kind of person desicrates a defenseless notebook with...with..PENIS drawings? I gotta good mind to put this in your PERMANENT RECORD! Now, I want you to tell me..Mr Dick Blister....no,...no...I want you to stand up and tell the ENTIRE CLASS...
what do you wanna do with your life???
Chris looked me directly in the eye, tore the notebook from my hand and tossed it to Blake...looked him in the eye and said............
""I WANNA COCK!!!!""
the entire class broke into an unwholesome orgy of rock-and-roll, makeup tutorials and more hair than the devil can shake 3 sticks at.
I gave them all 3 hours detention immediately after school that day. Then retired...

please enlighten me how many rape victims there are that justify the millions of non-raped women? we can talk about the 1% if you want, fine. Rape, incest, needs to be proven first, then you can abort. you had a one-night stand and didn't use protection, no abortion for you.

&gt;Also i have an income of 600 euros a month. I live in a teeny tiny appartment. Im physically handicapped (energy problem). I use protection and all that, but it can happen none the less.

I would bring into the world an unhappy person who didnt get the love it deserved and would most likely be a burden for society or kill itself.

there is 4 steps that need to be taken before abortion is even considered. **first**, maybe don't have sex. the sure fire way not to get pregnant, is to not have sex. **2nd**, you already do, use protection or preventative measures. **3rd** if you somehow get pregnant and BC failed, there is adoption. **4th**, lastly, maybe grow the fuck up and live with your mistake and raise the child you are about to bring into the world, aka motherhood.

"&gt;They engaged the audience enough so that they never felt the need to question anything

Totally agree with this. The difference is that TLJ engaged me, so I was willing to let its foibles slide, just like I was with (almost) every other movie in the series.

How did Leia propel herself through space? I dunno, Luke probably trained her a bit after ROTJ. We've seen plenty of people use the Force to propel themself before. How did the door open? Someone pushed a button, they could all see her flying towards it. Why didn't the air flow out? Why doesn't the air flow out of every single goddamn hangar in the entire series? They have forcefields, why wouldn't they use them in airlocks?

Why do the laser blasts arc in space? Because heavy laser blasts have always arced, and they were flying near a planet. Why are the bombers slow? Because they're bigger because they hold more bombs. Bigger ships have always been shown to be slower and less maneuverable.

Again, I could go on. I liked the movie, so I'm willing to devote the modicum of effort needed to explain things the film didn't. It's cool if you don't like TLJ, but don't pretend that these problems aren't also present in pretty much every other movie in the series."

If you can't fathom why someone would eat like this, realize that if you ate ""healthy"" foods like fruit, yogurt or salad with the same amount of money you'd be pretty malnourished just from lack of calories. And for some people, eating 3000+ calories is what they need to maintain."

Also people in my family tend to be lactose intolerant and have other digestive issues which is easier to just switch the type of formula, rather than switching from breast feeding to formula. When I was a baby I had such bad colic caused by my undiagnosed lactose intolerance, I would scream from the time I had my first feeding until I went to sleep."

"I'm surprised you had to wait two weeks for an urgent test. I want to share my experience as an American in a similar situation.

A routine physical (free to me other than my normal monthly insurance payment) turned up an enlarged thyroid. My doctor sent me immediately to the radiology department and I had an ultrasound ($5 co-pay) about 45 minutes later. The results from the radiologist were available to me via the hospital's electronic portal about five hours later and my doctor called me the next morning to go over the results and sent me to get blood work done (no extra charges). No cancer (thank goodness). I saw an endocrinologist two days later who confirmed what the radiologist said, went over the results of the blood tests and gave me a prescription which now costs me $0.79 a month.

When I was 7 I actually did die for about 4 minutes but the doctors brought me back! I grew up in late 70s and 80s there was not a lot of medicine for a child with asthma back then. I remember two horrible tasting cough syrups I had to take one was yellow and tasted like lemons, mint and black licorice. The other one was red and tasted like strawberry and vicks. I got my first inhaler when I was 12. I never wanted to pass on my asthma to any child. So I chose not to have any. Now my asthma is under control thanks to many different meds."

"I’m not sure where I stand on this issue, to be completely honest. I do believe healthcare is NOT a basic human right, though. Nothing is a basic human right, in the sense of the word, except maybe oxygen.... and maybe the right to protect yourself. But healthcare? I don’t agree with those statements. BUT, I cannot see any reason why it would be a bad thing either. People are paying MASSIVE amounts of money to have measley health coverage, that doesn’t even cover 3/4 of costs. The deductibles are in the THOUSANDS, which need to be paid before your insurance even kicks in..... plus co-pays. ...... then it refreshes every year. Lather, rinse, repeat. With this current system, those same people who are paying these massive amounts of money for healthcare, are the same people who cannot afford to see a damn doctor because of deductibles and co-pays. So, I’m really not seeing any reasons that universal healthcare could hurt. It would certainly help more people than our current system does. I’m guessing medical professionals would be hard against universal healthcare? They work more for less, I’d imagine. But you know what, they will have job security and they will not have the high costs of malpractice insurance anymore, at least not in these sense that they have it now........ under a universal system, malpractice insurance would be covered I’d imagine if said doctor was working for the government, or the state.

"It seems logical...until you consider the reality of healthcare rationing.

If there were enough resources to adequately provide care in a timely manner for entire populations, then people wouldn’t have to wait eight months for a consultation with a specialist. They wouldn’t have to wait a year, on average, for some very basic, non-emergent surgeries. Canadians wouldn’t be utilizing the US healthcare system to avoid waiting an unreasonable amount of time. Latin American citizens wouldn’t make up a significant proportion of the patient base in Miami.

Almost all of the feel-good stories are about people who have EMERGENT health issues that require ED services or acute interventions. Situations where they don’t have the time or ability to mess with insurance fine print.

This sort of situation can be managed without relying on “socialized” healthcare. Poorly informed US citizens often equate socialized healthcare with single payer, despite the two having nothing to do with each other."

"I gave it a B or B+ for comic book super hero movies.  I’m not a fan of them to begin with, especially with so many of them out there now, that there hasn’t been a compelling story behind any of them.  Just CGI CGI CGI CGI and more CGI. Lots of explosions and fighting. And we know who is going to prevail.  

The late Roger Elbert coined the term “too much of a muchness” to describe these movies; over the top everything to drum up the importance of something that’s unimportant.  

Having said that, as far as it goes, Black Panther at least had a different look and feel.  Although it seemed there was a bit of a disconnect; the message seemed to be: 

- Africa has nothing in terms of technology compared to the rest of the world, except for this one secret sect that has technology far superior than anyone in the world

- All Africans are united in brotherhood and family

Then why the fuck didn’t this secret sect share its technology with the rest of Africa to make life better for its brothers?

"I constantly butcher words. I like to read, and when it comes to learning new words and their definitions, this works wonderfully. Unfortunately for me, partly because I'm thus not hearing those words spoken out loud while learning them, I also suck at pronunciation. To make the problem worse, it's like my brain just does not want to keep the pronunciation data when I do hear it. This causes some problems, and I usually find out that I'm mispronouncing a word at least once a week.

In the last month, I found out that I wasn't pronouncing the Pokemon species Celebi correctly. I found this out at a Pokemon Go raid in front of 15 people.

I found out recently that ""matte"" is not pronounced ""mat-tay."" 

My worst mispronunciation of all time was years ago. It turns out ""politician"" is NOT pronounced ""pol-LIT-ti-can"" and doesn't sound similar to the word ""pelican"" at all. It wouldn't have been so bad except I was 13 (so old enough that I should have known better) by the time I learned the truth, I got laughed at for this, and it occasionally still gets brought up so my shame will never die."

Even if a fetus is a full-fledged human life, it shouldn't have the right to use someone else's body without their consent. If an adult human can't survive without using another person's body (eg. by receiving organ or tissue donations), they can't compel anyone to donate in order to save their life. That means they might die. I don't know why a fetus would deserve *more* rights than a grown human."

"My point really revolves around how one sees a ""moral person"". Was Abraham Lincoln a ""moral person""? Is that concept simply wrong. I.e. no such thing? Sure he did a moral thing of note...but his legion of failures (not accepting racial equality, women's equality, LGBT equality, and w/e we as a species do in the future) disqualify him from the mantle of ""moral man"". 

In such a world, there is no such thing as a ""moral man"" until we develop a total moral system the likes of which we have never dreamed of. And in the same way it's true that ""if everyone's guilty, noone is"" well, if noone is moral, everyone is. 

That is to say, if we live in a world where we judge everyone, past and present, by a moral code we are still developing, we have no real way to say a person is moral or isn't, only individual actions. And maybe that's what we should do. This approach seems a bit..cool and aloof to me. Statues to concepts are not nearly as inspiring as people, even though the people are being honored for concepts espoused by their words and actions and are, themselves, mere imperfect vessels. 

It is this reason, this desire to be able to look up to people even though they have flaws, that I reject the harsh judgment moral absolutists sometimes engage in. I am reminded of a quote from the amazing (and yet deeply flawed) Thomas Jefferson: 

&gt;""I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.""

In that quote, he's talking about himself. He is one of the principle authors of a new government and he is the future barbarous ancestor he references. And he's right! We are all doomed to this. MLK Jr. didn't believe in gay marriage, should we tear his statues down? I don't think we should. Maybe you do. "

&gt;socialism is a post capitalism philosophy

No it's not, socialism has been around for hundreds of years.  
And it's always failed, and lead to government kleptocracy. 

&gt;social democracy is about imposing social safety nets within a capitalist system

Who pays for those safety nets?  Government steals money, labor, and property from people by force to provide said safety net.   Yeah, sounds a lot like socialism to me. 

The left has taken on this strategy of trying to rename socialism, like putting makeup on a pig.  Like, for example ""Democratic Socialism""....  They do this because socialism itself really isn't very palatable to the average American.  It's really just socialism-light to get your foot in the door.  But the end goal here is socialism.  
  And if you look at folks such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the end goal looks more like communism.  "

But I still can't help but feel his role isn't really needed any more. Marcus, especially, has gotten very good at giving details and telling the story. 

On top of that, he doesn't have the comedic chops of Henry.

So do sex organs or chromosomes contribute to sex? 

Actually fuck that let me jump to the chase.

They both do, and androdgynous people have both sex organs and different chromosome arrangements meaning they are either both male and female or neither which means there are at least 3 scientific sex arrangements.

"I don't know if that is enough at this point. I would argue that exploitation and suffering of millions upon millions of people is a characteristic inherent in capitalism; not just ""unfettered capitalism"", but capitalism itself.  

People often refer to a close past as 'the golden age of capitalism', usually the period post-WWII until the late 70's, but even back then this was not true for large segments of the population. As great and awesome the New Deal and the post-war economic recovery was, African-Americans and Native Americans, among other minorities, were shut out from it. And while our middle class was doing great, we imposed brutal and crushing exploitative capitalism on much of the third world through our direct financial and military support for dictatorships. Milton Friedmann and the Chicago Boys going to Chile to instruct Pinochet how to implement their economic strategies being the most blatant example.

"One of the best and craziest experiences ever. My fiancee has been a huge Jesse McCartney fan since she was a teenager. He happened to be in state, however a few hours away. We bought tickets months in advance. **Lightbulb**. This would be the perfect time to propose. 

I decided to take it up a notch. I contacted his website email figured I'd take a shot in the dark, even DM'd him on instagram. Eventually his manager got back to me. She was super nice. The original plan was for him to dedicate a song to her, and then I would propose in the crowd. 

About a week out, she emailed me and asked if I'd want to do it on stage. ""Holy shit"", I thought. I got this email at work and was in a daze the rest of the day. I knew my fiancee had anxiety and this may not be the best way to do it, but thought ""fuck it, I'll never have another opportunity like this.""

I agreed, we exchanged some more emails to get the logistics down. Day of the concert for some reason they change it to open seating. Well fuck. We had 3rd row tickets and now we're screwed. I was texted his manager while we were there to try and tell her where we were sitting. At one point she came over during the set and stood behind and to the side of my fiance to help Jesse identify who to bring on stage during a song. Im a big bearded dude so I was trying to like signal to him somehow. Eventually it worked. Anyways, his manager grabbed her arm and escorted her stage left. I walked stage right when she was out of sight. 

As I walk to the side of the stage, I hide behind a big speaker so she can't see me. I handed my phone to one of the very, very few dudes in the crowd and asked him to film. We never did really talk about how this would go down once she was on stage. So I waited. At the end of serenading her, he knelt down on his knees and placed his head on her lap for a moment. I knew that was my time. I went up and tapped him on the shoulder to which he replied ""Oh, Im sorry"" and stepped away. Then she realized it was me on stage. Once I knelt down time stopped. However, once youve experienced the collective screaming of 800 college aged girls, you haven't lived. Or been deaf, whichever. Needless to say she said yes. Once we walked off that stage we felt like fucking rockstars. 

I ruined the dreams of most of those girls last night and set them up for false expectations. My apologies to the dudes that eventually propose to the girls in the crowd that night.

One of the first shaped charge rocket launchers in the world was made by the Germans, it is that weird tube with the bulbous front that sort of looks like two pie plates pressed together.

I had just learned about it on the History Channel a few weeks prior to seeing the movie and I was getting excited to see one fire when I realized the movie had them in it....and never once did it fire!

This became a giggle worthy thing between my father and I because as the movie goes on it's taunting you with these rockets. Seriously, when they first show up there's just like one or two on screen.

"&gt; Donald Trump will definitely not be removed from office and probably won't even be impeached.

First half right but wrong and the second part entirely wrong. 

Second part first, *""... probably won't even be impeached""*. At the moment it's hovering at 50/50 that the House goes for impeachment, but there's almost guaranteed an ""October Surprise"" coming from Mueller. Whether or not Trump turns out to be target is entirely beside the point. It's how Trump *reacts* that will determine it. And Trump so far has a near spotless record of making things worse for himself because of poor self-control. 

An indictment of either Don Jr or Kushner, the only fish left big enough that the plea deal with Manafort warranted, would be more than he could silently do nothing about. He's especially toast if the Dems get the Senate and the Republicans have no more use for their useful idiot. He won't even be able to nominate such terrible judges as Kavanaugh for the remainder of this term. Hell, the Republicans might decide to throw him under the bus, vote him guilty and then hope they can get a few more loyally conservative judges in the courts with a President Pence. 

*""Donald Trump will definitely not be removed from office...""* 

By impeachment? No. Unless Mueller drops some kind of bombshell, which is unlikely at this point, even if he gives Congress an impeachable offense for Trump's involvement it's highly unlikely it is severe enough for 15 or so Republicans to cross the aisle to reach the 67 votes needed. 

But obviously Donald Trump is the **most insecure man to ever sit in the Oval Office.** According to Woodward's *Fear*, Trump did not think he was going to win in 2016 right up to the very end. Only Bannon had absolute confidence they could pull it off. Hence, Trump might see impeachment as his ""get out of political jail free card."" The loss of independents has doomed any chance for re-election, especially with no Hillary to run against in two years. 

So he pulls a classic Trump move, declares victory and proclaims ""I am not going to let the corrupt Washington elites have their way. I got you a huge tax break, saved the economy from mess Obama left it in and made America the best country in the world again. But I won't let them win with this dirty, illegal impeachment trick so I am out of here!""  and resigns, removing *himself* from office. 

Further prediction: he just leaves without any formal resignation and creates minor constitutional crises because the founders did not anticipate such a venal, petty and ignorant person getting elected in the first place. "

Before this discussion or thread develops any further, I do want to clarify that I do not have any affiliation with either side. I do share a lot of opinions with the right instead of the left, but I feel like this election it was choosing between two evils and being honest, I think the lesser was elected. From my perspective Trump truly wants the best for America and that's something you should respect. Where I live, The Netherlands, our reigning party (parlementary democracy) doesn't care about the people but more about the advancement of their career.

I've been truly, utterly dead inside. I hated myself, and was sure nobody would miss me if I died or went away. I *wanted* to die or vanish. I didn't care about anything else; I had no emotional strength left in me to do so. I didn't hurt or cut myself, because that would have taken some degree of thought and action. I lost all interests, all passion, all my will to live. At some point, life for me just... stopped. I was a wind-up doll, a zombie, a computer program going through the motions. Had someone mugged me, attacked me, if I'd fallen ill or been injured, I would have let it happen.

"Let me make a more serious criticism after a few minutes to think on this. Your comment gives me the feeling you want things both ways. You want the relationship between dancers and customers to be a professional transaction in which a service is paid for, but you're also trying to act like customers are socially obliged to make the dance as pleasant as possible an experience for their stripper. But the customer doesn't owe you anything not specifically established as a requirement by the venue, and guilting them into giving you a better experience goes outside the professional confines of the interaction. Your aims seem at odds unless your goal isn't to establish some consistent standard for employee-customer dances but instead is to maximize the benefits of being a stripper. My own feeling is that women who are uncomfortable grinding on men's junk in some circumstances shouldn't act as professional strippers who give lap dances. That'd seem to solve any possible problem here, without the need for hyper specific codes of conduct in which getting dances in slacks is fine but getting dances in track pants is blameworthy.

And before someone implies it, I'm not making this argument because I go to strip clubs in sweatpants and feel defensive. I've never been, partly because of concerns about stigma. I don't feel there's anything intrinsically wrong with working at such a place or with buying dances at a such a place, though, so I don't like seeing men get shamed for having the audacity to think strip clubs exist for their pleasure."

"I’m in the minority here and I’m fine if I get downvotes, but I’m circumcised and the wife and I both wanted our son circumcised.

I am not religious and I understand that it is unnecessary and the original reasons are bullshit, but I didn’t want my son having a different looking penis than mine, and I think a circumcised penis looks better. Perhaps it’s due to societal norms, but the overwhelming majority of women I’ve asked say they prefer circumcised penises as well.

As for the “circumcision’s original purpose was to prevent masturbation,” so was corn flakes.  Doesn’t mean we should get rid of it today."
"No idea. Ironically I think it's actually much safer when performed by a Mohel (Jewish priest that specializes in circumcision, although I don't have a source for this, just something I heard on NPR) than a doctor, so I would be intetested to see the numbers from hundreds of years ago too."

But I still find polygamy the same as cheating. You should be loyal to one person, especially nowadays when people aren't even loyal to themselves. I would also find it immoral to push my beliefs on someone else's life. As my comment said, it is my friend who believes this, not someone I hate due to having a different view.

"Every action is an individuals choice and I don’t condone telling others how to live....but

when reading about circumcision It seems better to have it done ASAP. 

The only negative aspects seem to be if the procedure is done incorrectly causing physical pain or damage. Beyond that it seems like a healthier choice. 

However this is all based on a few article I read online in 20 minutes after seeing this post."
"I’ll say this it is all anecdotal. But I have heard (yes, American) women literally make fun of uncircumcised penises and trash them to shreds.  Call them all types of hilarious names. I’ve never heard women roast circumcised penises. "
I agree with the argument of someone having the choice but to me people in this thread are over sensationalizing circumcisions. You’d think they were touring kids the way people talk about it in this thread.

Yeah I know but medical problems also occur from not being circumcised so they’re pretty comparable in most areas other than look

Sure, I had a surgery with the primary goal of improving the look and feel of my dick because of a lack of sex drive. I figured ""Here I am with my low libido. Better clean this shit up for nobody to see it."" Solid conclusion, Sherlock.

It was unpleasant, but I was living my life more or less as normal within two days. The antiseptic cream stung a little, and catching the stitches in the gauze was comparable to pulling a nose hair. I suffered more from a broken rib, though, and I'd take ten circumcisions before another kidney stone.

"hard to tell when the anti-circumcision people begin conversations with ""mutilated"" and end with ""you're awful and should be ashamed of your body"" "
"An argument the Nazis made to dehumanize Jewish people specifically is a little different than commenting on the weather, millions of people were not killed over the weather. There are cases where men were forced to show their genitals and were executed if they were circumcised. The comment literally says that Jewish people should not be allowed in Iceland if they practice circumcision, and because almost nobody practices circumcision besides Jewish people, it is very tied to religion.

I think it's a complicated issue. Ireland only recently legalized abortion, another issue of body autonomy being violated on religious grounds. I am against male circumcision but I think you have to be thoughtful of the persecution of Jewish people specifically over thousands of years because that history (and the fact that it's still happening) is very relevant. I'm not disagreeing with you, I just think you cannot ignore the implications of religious persecution with a law like this. "

"Yes because because purposeful damage to female genitalia is the exact same thing as male circumcision.  

There is a reason that there have been large movements to try and outlaw female genital mutilation for decades.  If you think that removal of foreskin is akin to what occurs during female genitalia mutilation then you need to educate yourself about the topic before continuing this conversation."
"The constitution can’t be “outdated” as it isn’t about technologies or culture, it is about rights."
"The difference is that your argument is bullshit because it's not just a semantic argument. The foreskin provides no real medical purpose, all of the body parts you just listed do. That is a pretty major difference in deciding whether something is essential, and is why I think your argument is bullshit."
He broke his arms.
Excluding jews from society because of their religious beliefs is not nearly the same thing as being anti-smoking. The person I was replying to said they're fine with banning observant jews from their country. I fail to see how this is any different then Trump's muslim ban. 
Yes because riding the bus and excluding jews from an entire country because of their religious beliefs are at equal levels of distance from the core nazi ideology and entirely incidental to why we hate nazis.
I think circumcised dicks look like dildos. A boring mushroom on a stick.
"Incorrect. The constant friction on the inside of the pants desensitized the head of the penis.  Also, the foreakin acts as lubricant as it can retract and expand over the head during masturbarion or sex. The physics of both acts are very different with and without foreskin.  "

"I have strong feelings about whailing and hunting for ivory... You don't have to have direct experience with something to realize it is unethical.

"  Your last statement is false and I know from personal experience. Circumcision is simply not mutilation by definition as the penis is not spoiled, or disfigured, or is it a violent injury. It is simply a small piece of skin removed. The benefits outweigh any of the cons associated the procedure. Culture does have some
Implications as there is hazing in some environments for children not being cut in the US at least."
I have a friend who is a nurse who loves to tell stories about patients who have come in with something wrong because they werent circumcised. Infections are definitely still a problem. 
"Those two are completely different things. Sure, circumsised dick is less sensitive, but other then that its totally fine. FGM takes away woman's ability to ever enjoy sex, period."
"Imagine if you where raped as an infant. Would you care if you couldn't remember it? Maybe, maybe not. But you sure as hell wouldn't let other people keep raping infants. 

&gt;inb4 they are not equivalent.

They absolutely are. Circumcision is an extremely painful procedure whether you remember it or not. You are being strapped down on a table so you can't move, then a man takes a knife to your penis and cuts into your flesh. If you are an orthodox jew, after your penis has been circumcised, the mohel will suck on your penis, and sometimes herpes will be transmitted. And its all done without anesthetic because its too risky to give anesthetic to infants."
"I mean, it’s objectively true that circumcision lowers the risk of HIV and increases cleanliness. So."
You just pushed the damn agenda of genital mutilation and didn't care to think to help any future kids from losing part of their dick.

It's arrogant and misguided to claim that we know what's best for that family based of our own belief. 

If they think circumsizing their baby is the best choice than they are the only people who make that choice, because the baby can not think or decide for itself.

I'm not stupid, I know full damn well that absolutely no one would take that job, it'd be instant suicide.

"**Easier hygiene.** Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. However, boys with uncircumcised penises can be taught to wash regularly beneath the foreskin.

**Decreased risk of urinary tract infections.** The risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later.

**Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections.** Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.

**Prevention of penile problems.** Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.

**Decreased risk of penile cancer.** Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.

His new trade deal will also help Mexican farmers and farm workers. 


Also a lot of very bad drug dealers and human traffickers come through the border each day and they’re the ones fueling the US with heroine and cocaine and illegal marijuana and the human traffickers also rape women who travel alone. Also s lot of people die of exhaustion or heat stroke in the desert trying to enter the US and once they’re dead out there it could be years before they’re discovered. I actually had a family member die trying to enter the US illegally this year. It was very sad for the whole family. I’ve never seen my mom cry so hard before. Nearly all of us in my family are legal and we would much rather see our family who still lives in Mexico enter the US in a safe and legal way that keeps them away from human traffickers and drug dealers. The drug dealers get poor Mexicans who can’t afford to pay the human traffickers to help get smuggled in, to be drug mules.

I have a cousin who was born in the US but has lived her whole life in Mexico and now she’s working very hard to help legalize her husband and her daughter to help them enter the US legally. Which is how it should be done. No one wants to see little children in the hands of drug dealers and human traffickers.

IMO he should do less frequent podcasts and focus on more quality guests. I feel like 80% of his guests lately are people nobody has ever heard of outside his community.  Sometimes less is more.   Also he should research his guests better. He had Kristen bell on and asked her “if she still sings” after she talked about singing as a kid.  Like.  Duh?
In the past year the podcast has gone superleftist as well. It's kinda disappointing.

All the baby boomers are retiring right now so positions in jobs and the economy is growing but with the generations to come and with us not reproducing because of other obligations such as trying to pay a mortgage and other bills the economy will see a big decline in growth.

Your problem is that you are unable to conceive of the resilience of the marketplace.  You believe that if a company is eradicated then the wealth disappears instead of being transferred.  We will have to disagree \*shrug\*

I would also argue strongly that the rise of the front-running *flashboy* exchange is not beneficial to the world economy and that is why time-delay limited exchanges have been created.  Just because companies can harness near-light speed financial transactions does not mean that wealth has improved the world economy.  It just means a small share of algorithms are harvesting on behalf of funds.

I also disagree strongly that the ***entire*** economy has changed.  Hardly.  We still have bartenders and barista's, farmers and hairdressers, plumbers and drivers.  We still have engineers and sales and marketing and medical staff.  We still have poets and artists and filmmakers and theatres.  We still have toymakers and bakers and supermarkets and aerospace and satellites and automative...

*Some* of the economy has changed but for many countries in the world, the overarching economic system is still the same.  You are essentially saying the world economy would collapse because you don't have netflix.

That's a really valid concern, shitty teacher aside. I have tutored college students at various levels of math and I am constantly amazed how incomplete their high school math education was. 

One friend was getting ready to take the GRE and go to grad school. She was intelligent and educated, but didn't have any math skills beyond ~algebra I. She had only taken 3 years of math in high school. Now she has to spend at least a year taking community college classes while working full time just to get to that basic math level.

My point is that four years of high school math is important if you go on in higher education. The fact that everyone was pushing you into that final year was filled with well guided, good intentions. Sorry it ended poorly. "

For example, I live in Pittsburgh. We take our pierogis very seriously because of who ended up settling here. There's a thousand other places in the US where no one eats pierogis.

Europeans just seem to have a very narrow view of what we eat here. It's entirely regional besides some main staples. But that's like saying all of Europe eats pasta so that's their food! We might all enjoy a burger now and then, but I'm not getting good gumbo in Pittsburgh.

Like almost every major city is going to have a China Town, a Little Italy, (here we also have Polish Hill), etc. Where we basically have grandmas (or people who learned from their grandmas) that open restaurants to deliver food to that ethnic community/people who want that food.

I appreciate that there are some extreme circumstances but that thread spoke mostly of people who had no intention of raping anyone, they thought things were fine and then felt terrible when they weren't.

"This is all bullshit, all people are people with equal opportunities at success. The difference is in the individual, and why would someone who is racist date outside of their race?

I get sick of people saying I belong to a group that’s privileged even though I don’t reap any benefits while those who are “oppressed” are given free rides to colleges because of affirmative action. It’s bullshit. We come from different backgrounds and culture but in America it’s about the will of the individual to work hard to be successful.

HOWEVER, I clarify that just because it is not likely to occur, it wouldn't mean your story is false and through personal experience I do  know to which point people will blind themselves just to support a deep-rooted belief.

"Kodi is a free media player program. It has a *lot* of streaming add-ons. If I can't find something on Netflix I use Kodi. Little bit of effort to set up, but here are pros and cons:

**Pros**
- It's 100% free
- You can't get viruses because you aren't going to any shady sites.
- You can connect your imdb account info to it so that you can just look through your watchlist rather than search (if I'm in the mood for something specific I'll open imdb on my phone while Kodi is booting up and add it to my watchlist so when I pull up the list in Kodi it's the first choice)
- Many repositories (where the add-ons pull from) will have just about everything, including stuff currently in theatres

**Cons**
- Can be slow as snot to load
- Sometimes when you pick a source (it gives a list of possible ones, usually a long list) it'll require a sign in for their website. Hitting cancel let's you move to the next source
- Setting up takes being able to go through guides. Only difficult if you have no technical aptitude since it literally walks you through step by step
- I've had one or two where the sound was not synced with the movie. It can be fixed with fiddling with settings. Much easier to do this on the PC program than on the phone app
- Subtitles need another repository
- If the movie is in theatres or just recently released it's probably going to be crappy quality. It's recorded in theatre and will be replaced close to the time the digital copy gets released"

But in a political climate where Obama gets called a socialism for proposing a health care option that was initially proposed by Nixon, and enacted by Romney, even though it's *the government forcing private citizens to buy private healthcare*, indicates how delusional and right wing extremist the political climate is.

And it is that way because of privatized interest of politics since Republican Justice Lewis Powell enshrined corruption, if not before that.

There's a reason Americans call literally everything that's not fascist leftist (anti-fa, despite being anarchist, as well as communists and socialists are ALL leftists), and it's because the political dialogue has been shifted to the extreme right."

"The only way he loses is if another celebrity runs against him, like Oprah or Howard Stern or Vince McMahon.  It's unbelievable to me that nobody has realized this yet. Americans will vote for any celebrity, and that's actually probably the majority of Trumps's support, but certainly his initial support. I know my grandmother voted for him just because of his public persona.  She was like, ""Say, that's familiar!""

Can I be the only one who knew Trump would win the second he ran? Or Al Franken, Arnold, or Jesse Ventura for that matter. Was there any doubt in your minds that people would vote for a celebrity? They voted for Sonny Bono FFS. They enthusiastically voted for Reagan for governor and president and he was just like a mild celebrity that appeared in chimp pictures. 

The only way the democrats win in 2020 is if

1) They run Bernie. He's enough of a celebrity now for that to work.

2) They run any other celebrity of Trumps stature or higher. Trump was maybe a C list celebrity so an Oprah or a Clooney would certain work.

I don't know why too many people would be a problem. People may complain of wait times, but those would be no different from a *normal* population as more facilities can be built to fit the demand, but demand can't be created. "

His aunt is right, he SHOULD share his resources with the people letting him stay with them. He SHOULD stop lazing around and either go to school or help rebuild. Yes it’s sad that society at large is indifferent to the fate of two children after a war. But society is ALWAYS indifferent to suffering! If his mom had died in a golden era and he was in the same situation but against a backdrop of normalcy, his fate would be exactly the same because people do not fucking care. We live in a world where kids starving to death is a normal thing that happens every single day. Why do we value this shitty kid who makes poor choices in a movie, but not all the actually innocent real kids who are starving to death right now? 

How dare we sob and moan at this one emotionally exploitive movie, when people die every day because of lack of access to food and health care and no one gives a shit. How dare we, as people, feel sadness at this movie, when we cause this situation to play out literally every day regardless of how safe and structured society appears to be? How dare we look at this and imagine it as a function of one war and one era, when we carry the same indifference to suffering on a wide scale every single day of our lives? It’s good the kid died, it’s the only happy ending, he gets to be done with the shit world and it’s shit indifferent people, but his presence wouldn’t improve the world because he’s also shitty."

It's your fault if your girl acts like this. You didn't loved her. Who do you think she learned that from? Yes. Look in the mirror.
"Let’s be clear at the outset - you can be arrested and imprisoned for possession of drugs. Not everyone who is arrested for drugs is a dealer and users far outnumber dealers.

&gt; White people tend to sell to friends, too, so how are you going to catch them in the act?

Have the police go to high-end nightclubs and start “stop and frisking” everyone in there. Roll up on people at house parties, walking down the street in nice neighborhoods, etc. Basically utilize the same tactics universally because when one does not, you create de facto sanctioned marketplace where drugs are used and exchanged freely with rare consequence. 

&gt; I don’t see how that’s weird.

That society says, “Drugs are bad and must be stopped.” And then basically focuses on one group to such a huge extent that the other group uses twice as much but gets arrested and sentenced to jail a fraction as often as the other? Then tries to say, “There’s no bias,”???

&gt; Also, roughly 90% (IIRC) of meth users and dealers are white. That carries the same penalty as the harder drugs.

And yet Black people are 5.8x more likely than White people to be arrested and imprisoned for illegal drugs! (Also, I doubt these meth folks are selling to “friends and family”.)

"Wasn’t trying to own any libs today...but since we’re on the subject, no I don’t think everyone deserves health care. I don’t have any particular problem with paying for those who genuinely can’t work and therefore can’t afford health care (but we already do this to a large degree, albeit could be implemented better). My problem with universal healthcare is the same as my problem with any social welfare program. People are fucking lazy. In a melting pot such as America, a large portion of the population lacks a vested interest in the well-being of their neighbors, or in the future of their country as a whole. And as a result, you find people abusing the hell out of our welfare programs because they don’t give a shit about America and it’s citizens - they’re just here for the free ride. So forgive me for losing my sense of empathy. I work 70 hours a week and I pay for my own necessities and thanks to my hard work that means I can afford things like healthcare and even the occasional vacation or material thing I might want. If you don’t have a problem paying for free-loading beggars that hate you, that’s your prerogative, but as for me, thats gonna be a no from me dawg. If you won’t help yourself, don’t expect me to."

As far as your question goes I would ask a simple question: do you just want to read the story, or do you want detailed description of everybody's motivations and history as well as the story? Because the uncut adds a lot of background detail about characters. It is one thing yo introduce your characters, develop them and give a little bit of history and motivation. But SK is very....detailed in the uncut. In general I'd say read Uncut cause it is the ""complete"" story but you'd not miss anything major by just reading  the original version.

"I make minimum wage but I’m against raising it. You have to look at wage for what it is: the price of a commodity, labor. 

By artificially adjusting the price of labor, something else in the equation has to give. Often, it’s the price of the goods or services those employees are providing, and so the wage increase is generally nullified. 

In theory, it’s better to leave wage alone and foster an environment that leaves employers with more money (ie tax cuts.) "

"I really don't understand why my comment have been downvoted, and if you don't agree with something i said then speak up. It doesn't surprise me that it is getting downvoted because, well, I am a man, and often times many women will say ""you are not a woman, and you have no fucking right to tell a woman anything about her body. You don't know what it is like to give birth, so your opinion isn't valid."". Well, thanks, but I disagree. No, i don't know what it feels like to give birth, but I have been present for three births, and two out of the three went perfectly, and the women giving birth both said that it really wasn't painful, and both of these were home births where their bodies and their choices were respected. The other birth was done at a hospital, and the baby was delivered by a doctor, a MAN, who had zero respect for the woman involved, her body, or her wishes, and that experience was hell, and that young woman suffered immensely at the hand of ""professionals"". That doctor came in there and took that baby out of her as quickly as he could, as if it was just business as usual, and with no regard for the two lives involved. He even threatened to take the baby by c section if it didn't come out in the next 45 minutes, and the birth only took less than two hours. 

That isn't the only horror story i have heard about from hospital births. I know lots of women who's first child was delivered at a hospital, by a man, and they had a horrible experience, so they decided they would never do that again, and the rest of their children were birthed by true midwives, and they had lovely experiences. 

Child birth is a beautiful event. It is life blooming into this world! Why do we choose to bring our children into this world in the same facilities that people go to die? Why do we allow them to make the experience so surgical and like a procedure rather than the intimate beautiful event that it is? 

It's truly sad that someone who is speaking up for women and children is being shown negative reactions for their passionate attempt to reach out and help. "
"The original story is based entirely on their ignorance and the “cunt” behaviour of the customer is likely just their perception because they think tea temperature is trivial.

Wanting tea at a tea shop to be prepared at proper temperature is not entitled just as expecting steak to be medium rare and not well done when you order it isn’t. Maybe the guy was an asshole but it’s clear this poster has an axe to grind given the descriptors they used. 

I’d call that, along with the responses to the people that nicely explained that temperature matters by saying “perhaps” then going on about how it doesn’t matter a bit condescending, yes. "

The United States of America is an absolute disgrace when it comes to protecting its citizens, the fact that the current ammount of school shootings isn't an epidemic is exactly the problem.

Now there are also huge issues of missinformation, I know CNN loves fearmongering, so Ill drop [this fact check](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/school-shootings-us-vs-world/) as a source rather than the article it refers to, the point is, one side is inflating the numbers and fearmongering while the other side is trivializing them, neither help.

My point still stands though, US is the most dangerous first world country and it has to do something about it, and if the rest of the modern world is anything to go by the solution is gun control.

We have the ability to do so much through voting. And shocker- most politicians are just people. It's not hard to see how and why they act or what they mean when they say things if you just actually learn the environment they exist in, and then assume they're people with certain goals.

Takes time, I know- reading, it's so hard. Watching bogus documentaries is a lot easier. But it's so worth it to read news, reputable books, read studies and academic consensus around those studies, and then the counterfactuals of that consensus or study.. anyway...

**Vote. It can change everything, at any time, if we actually do it.**

The problem is your question isn’t really suited for specifics. 
We’re talking about tens of thousands of people over tens of thousands of square miles who, as somebody else already suggested, may or may not even want government intervention in the first place. I can’t tell you specifically what would happen because I’m not sure anybody knows what the immediate repercussions would be.

I’m not sure you appreciate that “red tape” is the difference between money being put into reservation land, and money being put into land near the reservation. It’s the difference between natural resources being procured from the tribe, and from somewhere else. 

Similarly, massive bureaucracy is prime breeding ground for corruption which also is poisonous to economic growth. 

I don’t want to bring race into it, but in a very real sense reservations are just rural ghettos - you stay there, we’ll stay here. That’s also a driving factor in their poverty, but it’s hard to see how *more* restrictions on business and development are going to help that. "

If that’s true than I want to go back to the old system and pay for it myself and leave the ones who don’t want to work behind. 

Edit: why would anyone down vote this? It’s not political, just facts. Are facts scary? If so you need to rethink your life. "

Circumcision isn't genital mutilation. Don't use words you don't know the meaning to.
I don't want to clean mine. I just do a quick dry dusting so it's properly aged like a pair of jeans.

You sound like someone who mutilated their child and is only interested in information that confirms their poor decision.
"You're wrong.  Treatment for cancer doesn't prolong life.  It makes quality of life far worse.  Do a little homework.  Doctors don't do cancer treatment themselves because they know it's useless.  Spend a little time googling the subject and you'll probably come to the same conclusion.

She died because she had cancer, not because of a problem with our healthcare system.  We don't know how to fix cancer.  That's why so many people still talk about finding a cure for cancer.

"I didn't say you said people should do it. 

And I don't care whether you would think the circumcised or not look is more aesthetically pleasing, depending on how your own penis is fashioned. I don't care one iota.

What you haven't addressed is whether you believe parents should be making that decision. Whether parents should be making what amounts to a cosmetic decision on behalf of a life that isn't their own."

"It's not only for religious reasons. It can also have to do with health and higiene reasons, the shape of the foreskin can make one more prone to infections and smell (I guess back then, when people didn't shower much, it was better to circumcise) I remember going to the pediatrician with my brother when we were little and the doctor had to pull his foreskin back, hurting him; he should just have been circumcised at birth.

"Again. This is all your opinion. I don't agree with your opinion. But that doesn't mean I'm forcing my opinion on you and making my opinion into law. That would be silly and self centered of me...

But I do know that because of my circumcision I've never had to deal with infections that are associated with uncircumcised penises. I've never had to worry about phimosis or paraphimosis. Which has been great to not have to deal with and also great to not get circumcised at a later age. 

Anyway, good luck with your opinion and hopefully someday you'll realize that people should be allowed to decide what they do with their own child and not have to be forced to follow your opinions when raising their own child.

I don't know about y'all, but in my mind, I sense desperation in that comment. You can only do so much to influence other people into liking you. There is no magic word or magical action that will get someone to fall for you romantically right away. The one person you do have control over and are guaranteed to be with until you die is yourself. You can be happy with yourself and still feel lonely, I agree with that, but you gotta keep those feelings in check, because once someone sees you leak desperation, you're gonna have a hard time getting with anyone."

So let me get this straight because someone loves animals they NEED to be vegan and if they are not they support animal cruelty / suffering? God damn you are a very one minded person who believes that if someone likes something but doesn't go to the extreme with it they are absolutely hate it and are in support of its enemies. You sir are not someone who's who should be debating anything if they don't think about logic and facts and only argue with their opinion and try to force that on others like you are doing.
Doesn't a tumble dryer make this false?
"It certainly is. The people I know prefer a sanitary aesthetically pleasing penis that is scientifically proven to be less likely to transfer disease.

"&gt; I don't care because I don't think about it it's never came up until now.

I mean. You’re the one that brought up the whaling example so it obviously has been brought to your attention before and you do think about it to some extent. If you’re talking about circumcision, I find it hard to believe that it’s “never came up until now” but well, it definitely has now. So you can’t feign ignorance or that you’ve never thought about the topic. "
It wasnt normal in the states til the late 1800s. It was pushed by a certain lobby. Its known to cause irreparable affects on the brain. I cant help but wonder if theres a correlation between widespread circumcision and the extremely violent wars of the 20th century
"YES.  But only if it's the right information, like, an actual trans person without rampant internalized transphobia (maybe Janet Mock?) writing the information provided."
"Instead of just answering my question, I get harassed. Like owner, like dog. "
"There are medical benefits though but still risks. 

I agree a lot of times it's for cosmetics but the medical community still suggests it a lot of times for the benefits. It has been shown to lower some transmition of diseases. But that isn't necessarily a good enough reason but one to consider medically. "
"&gt;The treatment for the mental “illness” known as gender dysphoria is transitioning.

"It's not an ""I *get to* circumcise my kid"" practice but rather a ""My religion sees circumcision as spiritually clean"" practice.

It's not just some infant, it's a person you're hoping will grow to become a follower of your beliefs (if done for religious reasons) or a like-minded individual who will match the expected appearance of the era (if done for other reasons).

It doesn't constitute mutilation - the removal of the foreskin provides at best aesthetic difference and at worst an apparently undetermined change in sensitivity, which is glossed over by pro-cut or exaggerated by anti-cut every time it comes up. Calling it ""mutilation"" varies completely depending on which side you're on, because ""mutilation"" implies an obviously negative event, which is up for debate.

Whether or not a religious belief is ""weird"" depends on who you ask and how familiar you are with a particular religion/practice."

"Same here bro, plus it def feels better and all the girls I've been with like it and prefer it. I def wouldn't do it as an adult but I'm 100% glad it got done to me as a kid. Now I'm in the position where I'm expecting a kid and gotta make that decision... "
"Except it's been shown in medical studies to be beneficial.

&gt;Systematic evaluation of English-language peer-reviewed literature from 1995 through 2010 indicates that **preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure.**

&gt;**Benefits include significant reductions in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life and, subsequently, in the risk of heterosexual acquisition of HIV and the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections.**

&gt;Male circumcision performed during the newborn period has considerably lower complication rates than when performed later in life.

"However, orthodox Jews are supposed to have one at 8 days old.  If they can have it performed outside the country, it just makes it more expensive to be Jewish.  If you can be prosecuted for having it done outside the country and returning, that makes it illegal to be an orthodox Jew.

It's religious persecution, whether you think it's a good thing or not.  I mean, we don't allow Aztecs to sacrifice people on altars either."
You're being a jerk for calling them jerks for enjoying nature. And go ahead and mention something that makes you sound less like a jerk that nobody on here could have known.
Why is it an easy one? It's an easy one for you because we share different beliefs about what circumcision does for our children. You don't think it's a big deal for your children to have a clean cut penis and I do. I don't think the government should control this decision for parents and their young.

"&gt;The hard part here is if your interpersonal style leads you to feel that your life is awful, you'll be forever alone, and you'll never get a second date, you might want to change it.  If it is totally working for you, great!  You don't need to take my advice!

A few things that I think are worth mentioning:

1. Re: ""forever alone.""  Thing is -- you and I wouldn't date, and we shouldn't date, not just because you wouldn't want to date me, but also because I wouldn't want to date you.  That's pretty important to recognize, because if one of us is accommodating the other's worldview or personality - like, constantly - that's a pretty lonely way to be.  E.g. - and I'm not saying that this is *you* \- but if an acquaintance were to say to me, ""I found this woman who's just perfect for you:  she self-identifies as a quirky paradox, she loves trying new foods and building character by way of travel, she won't shut up about Murakami, and she calls herself a 'social justice warrior' at every opportunity,"" my head would explode.
2. The way you framed that part about stuff ""working for me"" kind of implies that I'm the sole benefactor of some kind of tactic, as opposed to one half of a legit future couple who actually share a sense of humor and general worldview.  On the hierarchy of \[Future Couple\] &gt; \[Rejected by some goober, thank God\] &gt; \[humoring someone who actually thinks that inane shit is fascinating\], Future Couple wins out hands down.
3. This dude's disinterest in what you're saying is just as legitimate as your interest in the same.  Odds are, you sometimes say things that you know are boring just to see if he acts interested or bored.  If you say something boring, and instead of staring at your boobs the dude says, ""That is fascinating"" --- run for the hills.  This man is a moron, and he probably self-identifies as some kind of gentleman for reasons that are appalling and grotesque.  If you're desperate, and the two of you have a bit much to drink and go home together, this man is exactly the kind of goober who will completely ruin cunnilingus by acting like it's his favorite thing in the world (generous soul that he is).  You can thank him later for not having spaced out to stare at your tits.

To crunch those three points together:  Some girls are so evil that they're kind of like me.  You might disapprove, and you might not want to be friends with them (let alone date them), and that's fine.  We're not just talking about what ""works for me"" though -- we're talking about compatibility on a very real and necessary level.  If you'd rather me dishonor a woman by looking her in the eye instead of staring at her tits while she drones on about some bottomless self-mythology, I just don't think I can get behind that."
"You didn't fix anything. Most people wouldn't like an unhygenic person. My wife works in a salon with over 60 other 17-35yo women. Almost every one of them will not bang an uncut guy. You don't know what you're talking about and just are trying to be pretentious because you think being PC is like cool or something. I even know one of them who has had 3 uncut boyfriends will not bang an uncut guy. Just last week she met a guy, started hooking up, and left once she put her hand down his pants.

Most of the world lives in reality and accepts the fact that EVERYBODY LIKES DIFFERENT THINGS. No one needs to pretend to like something because it makes you feel better."
That’s dishonesty.
