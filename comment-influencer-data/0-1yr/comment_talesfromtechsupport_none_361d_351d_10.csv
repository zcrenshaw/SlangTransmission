"&gt;Thankfully $CEO saw reason and I never heard about it again.

This is the shocking part of the story"
"Selling The Box is like selling your winter jacket on the first day of spring. You're gonna regret it, it's inevitable."
Can you still wave your hand over a user’s keyboard and have their computer magically start working again? If so they may keep you a few more years before putting you out to pasture.
"People trying to call Google on the phone. In 2018.

Kill me now."
"I worked as a consultant back during the dot-com boom.  I like to think we were really good at what we did, and so charged accordingly.  I lost track of the number of times we'd write something up for a potential customer who would balk at the price.  ""My cousin's friend's uncle's ex-girlfriend's brother runs an IT shop out of his garage and he'll do it for less than half that!""

So we'd sit back and wait.  And sure enough, more often than not, a few months later the potential customer would become an actual customer with an even bigger mess to fix."
The real shock is in a month when OP goes to work and there's a hole in the wall anyway.
But cleaning it up from time to time (~once a decade) is also worth your time. I somehow ended having 6 phone (RJ11) cords while having just a single traditional phone user in my family remaining. I just tossed 4 of them.
"Based on the title, I thought this was going to be about the projection system being covered with tar from the smoke.

I hate getting used electronics from smokers because it's always caked with that crap."
"That's the old ""I'm going to fix something, but break something else so that you have to call me in a few days,"" shtick from the old car mechanic's handbook. "
"&gt; he just never fully understood that a reset would delete all his programs

Grief is different for everyone. I'm sure he had 100-300 or so open tabs as well"
Congratulations! Clicking 197 times has fixed the error.
"Really, really intelligent people don't need to mention how intelligent they are. It is obvious to everyone. I know that because I'm one of those really, really intelligent people... Wait a moment... Oh bollocks. "
"Well that sounds nearly useless. It'd be like looking at a piece of rusted metal and going ""well it's got some rust on it, so it could be fine, or it could be a catastrophic failure"", and then building the bridge anyway."
"I love this story, your box is so useful! I swear ours just has 20 kettle cords in it."
"Yeah, since we specialize in small businesses and residential we also run into this all the time.

My favorite is getting hired at a new company and they have us talk to their ""IT person"" who is almost always just some low level worker that once changed out the toner and now has to do all the tech work.

I wish I could convince more people to do contract preventative maintenance, the break fix repair cycle can be demoralizing."
"Tech illiterate people drive me up a fucking wall, buts it WAY worse when they are liars too. "
"Oh. My. God.    True story:  I had a can of febreze in my van for after working in a smoker's house.  I'd douse myself in that shit *double barf*, especially after this:

That reminds me of the worst set I'd come across; an elderly couple in a small cramped home had their TV by the door (thankfully) all their ~~white~~ brown curtains pulled and no light whatsoever.  So I had an excuse to keep the door open for light.  I get into the back and pull out the chassis, and everything, EVERYTHING is covered in black goo.  No colours to be seen anywhere.  Anything I touched I came back with black fingers.  They were both there sitting right behind me chain smoking. I find the problem but don't have the parts so I schedule a call-back.  
Luckily a coworker ends up doing the return repair, and with out me saying anything he stops me later that day and says ""Hey Erik, that RCA you had last week?  Man, that couple must have gone through 5 packs while I was working!"""
"I used to threaten violence to a family jewelry chains POS units over the phone and magically they ""listened "" and started to work again.  LOL"
"The messed up thing is half my job seems to explain we are not Google we just provide internet and we don't have access to your gmail.

Like more than 50% of my calls are about gmail. I now have the link to Google account recovery saved because I will say we don't have access and they give a sob story of why they need in their gmail ( cuz that magically gives me access?) Now I just send them to Google recovery and end the call...."
"You know, Office 265, the one that takes most weekends off."
"So I had 250 ""I Fucking Told You So"" business cards made up. 

I wish I could hand these out to some clients..."
"Indeed, never get rid of ""the box"". I still advise going through its contents from time to time: odds are you don't need tons of RCA composite or DE-15 VGA cables as you did fifteen years ago; one, maybe two of each for legacy support reasons."
"&gt;  was it incorrectly programmed or something?

&gt; $caller: Yes, I spilled some tea on it the other day, but I cleaned it up! Do you think it may have some do with it? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen this come up so many times, and even experienced similar on one occasion.  How do people not make this connection?  I get the a computers (and a lot of tech in general) are a total mystery/black magic to a lot of people, but anyone who didn't spend all their time in school shoving crayons up their nose should understand that liquid+electronics=bad"
"Odd, all I've gotten is a strong alcohol tolerance."
"I'm pretty sure that all printers have secretly gained sapience and collectively decided to make our lives as much of a hassle as possible.

...or maybe I just suck at printers."
Turns out the whole thing was a plot to cover up a mishap that occurred when $CEO was parking his car and pressed the wrong pedal. 
And a desktop full of Copy of Document (1) (223).docx
Better than a new hire we had that one day we realized she just deleted all her desktop icons without even asking what they were or if they were needed
Had to read and up vote since your story title is printed out and has hung above my desk for 4 years.
"""Everything works, why are we paying you?  Everything is broken, why are we paying you?""

It's hard to get people to pay for things they can't see until it all explodes."
I worked QA fire a software company. I showed them that repeating a particular action would work twice and then break indefinitely. Preforming any other action would reset the count and the first action would work twice again before breaking. It was the sorry if action that no one should ever be performing it twice in a row let alone three times but if you were bored or looking for bugs you just might. The developer just got mad at me for finding such an irrelevant bug and demanded to know why any user would do that three times in a row. He got even more upset when I asked why someone would program it to break on the third action.
I would have least asked for a screenshot to see what they were referring to 
"It should have been obvious when it asked him to log into Office 265, instead of Office 365, a product that actually exists."
Roadrunner. Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
"Just build her an app so she can make a profit from her horrible situation, god google why are you being so difficult "
"But *never* throw away the last one. The first time you need a 9-25 pin dsub adapter will be the day after you throw your last one out. May not have used it for 20 years, but here we are."
"yeah, I know that feeling of family members calling starting with:"" my *insert device* is not.... oh, now it's working, thanks""

glad to ""help"""
"""Looks like you got a door here, with a lock that could be broken. There's also a window, which seems to be some kind of glass, and glass can break"".

...

""Well, there's your burglary-test completed, that'll be 5000 bucks!"""
"There is such a need for an orientation class for parents. Perhaps it could be called ""They Need To Learn Independence Before You Are Dead"" or ""You Can't Take Them With You When You Die"". How will these children function if they aren't permitted to learn how to become adults?

(Edited to add that a manners class for parents wouldn't hurt either)"
"""It's not electronic, it's just the keyboard.""

- The User, probably"
"How did he put an HDMI cable in a displayport? They even have different shapes, did he physically bend the connectors?"
"We have one at work with probably 100 in it.

Our cable tester guy looked at it, tested the top 10 and said 'call me if you need to use more than that'. 

I don't think we have used any, we've added more if anything."
"&gt;I don't expect my dentist to offer free advice on his doorstep,

But can't you just put some braces in? I'm worried about my trip next week"
hopefully with that attitude she's not gonna have her job for much longer.
"I work for a local business that does residential services and repairs. If we fix something, and something else completely unrelated breaks after, all you need to do is yell at my boss enough and he'll send us over to fix it for free.

Okay, I fixed your internet. You needed the Wi-Fi password.
Oh, a week later your PC says ""Operating System not found"", just yell at my boss and insist it was our fault."
"""How to recognize a sucker for praise""

The guidebook"
Yup.  Last time I purged mine I think I had four S-videos in there.
"I'm not in tech support, but you seem like one of the best kind of people to support.

Obviously the best ones are the ones that don't need tech support (as in, everything is going well, no issues), but promptly admitting that you might have messed up, learning and wanting to learn, being polite AND baking cookies as compensation for IT support doing their job seems about as good as it can get.

Heck, the cookies are even better than what IT techs get from people who don't need tech support, so in the end you might actually be more appreciated than those guys 😝"
"At work, when something dies or gets upgraded, and is no longer capable of re-use elsewhere, I remove all connectors and cables for my box. Nobody complains anymore since enough of them have come to visit the box. Why would anyone want to throw something away just to have to buy another one?

My family used to laugh because I always brought a couple extra cables and essential plugs, as well as rubber bands, safety pins, and duct tape along on trips. It's entertaining how fast they stopped commenting on it once they needed it. "
