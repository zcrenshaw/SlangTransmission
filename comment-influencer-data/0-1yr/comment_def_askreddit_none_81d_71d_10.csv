"I ALSO puked at a Ponderosa. I was 12 and I don't know why we went there but my mom seemed to think it a novelty. I am working a great puker. I always know when something hasn't hit right and  have only been unable to get to the washroom a handful of times ( truly disgustingly I once filled an entire pint glass to the brim, stopped, then grabbed a second empty glass and puked 3/4 of the way into it we covertly took the glasses outside and threw them out [ it was a university bar I was worried they would just wash them once and use them again and golden rule and all I figured we all needed to call them dead.])

So back to my first disgusting story. I felt something hit wrong. Immediately jumped up and was scurrying off to the bathroom and this fucking lady wouldn't move out of my way out speed up. My sister who was trying to help said 'excuse me' twice and then said 'no really' and the woman waited until she was in a pinch point right by the bathroom and slowed right down. Well I pushed past my sister and then tried to push past the lady and she made a huffy noise and was starting to turn around when suddenly I puked at both our feet. I didn't get any directly on her but she def. got splashback. She wrinkled her nose and said 'ewwwww' I finally got past her and finished up in the women's washroom. My sister stayed and flagged down a waiter. The lady tried to get a free meal ( the waiter wonderfully said no they'd seen the whole thing) but all they did was put a chair overtop of it so no one would step in it and moved the closest table. I being a kid was now hungry and went back for more. My mom but realising exactly what happened let me. 30 minutes later she went to the washroom. It STILL just had a chair over it. They hadn't even put sawdust on top yet!

Last time I ever ate at Ponderosa."

"I actually saw this exchange in a courtroom:

Judge: ""So Miss you're in here for a ... seat cushion violation?  Wait is that even a thing?""

Def: ""Yes your honour""

Judge: ""State is this a thing?""

State: ""Yes sir""

Judge: ""How tall are you Ma'am?""

Def: ""About 5ft""

Judge: ""State, are you serious?  This is the dumbest case I've ever seen.  Dismissed."""
omg I forgot about this. Hillary def said some things that came off as super 'fellow kids-y'.
