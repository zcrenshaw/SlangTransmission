"Doesn't matter, because the train will come approximately 5 seconds after you pass through the exit turnstile."
"A friend of mine used to live on his boat in the 79th st boat basin.  He loved it.  I think it was a hassle to fuel up tho.  He spent a lot of time at the Dublin House.  It was a lot of fun in the summer.  On the other hand, he fell in the Hudson twice.  First time he was lucky and someone was there to help him out.  The second time he passed away.  The tide is much stronger than you, especially fully clothed in winter."
Duane Reade
An exterminator. Probably in every apartment in the building. Anything short of that won’t work at this point
Realizing that you couldn't get food (delivery or groceries) after certain times. The idea that I can't get anything after 8-9 pm in certain areas is still crazy to me.
"Walking everywhere - I distinctly remember business trips to Hawaii, Vermont, and Florida where colleagues thought I was nuts for walking the 10 - 15 minutes from the hotel to the office."
"&gt;My OB does not perform abortions and I've made my decision to protect my health.

Your OB should not be leaving you in the lurch and making you search for another doctor.  He or she should refer you.  It is even possible that the care you need is best provided in a hospital setting.  

Good luck."
"I feel like every time I try to do that, I have to cross a sketchy highway or take a huge detour to an overpass."
"Arrested? Shomrim (that’s how it’s spelled btw)? Lol. Only if they try to bribe the police for guns or molest a kid with an overwhelming amount of evidence (look at their Wikipedia entry for more info on those two). They pretty much get away with everything else. Do I mind a neighborhood watch existing? No. Do I object to one that copies all police identification, refuses to pass along evidence of widespread sexual abuse and criminal activity to the actual police, and intimidates people of other races and cultures who accidentally go into their area (see hundreds of videos on YouTube and r/nyc of Hispanic, black, Asian and other people getting harassed for simply walking), and acting as a religious police for women in the 21st century in a country thats supposed to guarantee freedom from religion? Yeah fuck that."
"Jeez, didn’t expect that ending. Sorry to hear"
This is the best answer here. Very accurate
I'm just lol'ing at someone going to the high end photography shop staffed entirely by Orthodox Jews and being like yep this is def a national thing.
No judgement at all. I’ve had friends have positive experiences with Planned Parenthood here. Best of luck to you! Not an easy decision.
Get it in writing. Leasing agent is trying to close a deal. The lease agreement is official.

Also it wasn’t until adulthood that I realized a city being comprised of several counties was an anomaly."

Not the R train"
"Breakfast: 2 espressos

Lunch: I pack my lunch every day, usually it's what I had for dinner 2 days ago. I prepare all of my meals, so when I make dinner I make extra which will be my lunch in 2-3 days (so that I have variety)."
"I think its because we mostly live in apartments with supers and we dont have to fix shit

They dont fix anything either though.

Life finds a way though."
"I think you can look up the address here

"Drinkable tap water. It's something we take for granted here. When I went to visit my cousin one winter in AZ, it wasn't hot but it was dry (along with thin air). So I took a glass and filled it directly from the tap. It was the most vile thing I ever tasted in my life. My cousin had a good laugh while her friend was like WTF is wrong with you?"
"Thanks, neither did anyone."
"I did for a while before, but not in NYC. I'd say the biggest issue might be how you adjust to feeling the boat rocking slightly at all times. Especially given the traffic in the water around there.

Outlets and power were all fine, but I had to get a weaker hair dryer.

Storms were always interesting. 

Everybody wants to come over all the time.

"Here's some good background reading: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/nyregion/brooklyns-private-jewish-patrols-wield-power-some-call-them-bullies.html

They have an ignoble and often racist history, but they so successfully ingratiated themselves with the police and elected officials that they're politically untouchable."
"I had no idea that normal post offices don't have bullet proof glass protecting the employees from the customers.

I assumed that was the standard everywhere."
"This really hit me in London last month. So many restaurants closed at 8pm. And they had the audacity in a tube station elevator to call themselves ""the city that never sleeps!"""
"This is why the MTA is horrible.  Not for unforeseen delays, but not just telling these damn people (us!!) what the best option is.  
If it isn’t coming, be honest.  Tell us ASAP so we can move on.  Walk to another line.  Take the bus. An Uber.  Hell, walk there more quickly.   Just don’t make us rot with false promises of a train that ain’t coming.

While we’re at it, if this express ain’t gonna move and the local is across the platform just tell us.  Well run over.  It won’t ruin our nights like when you wait for the train to leave to let us know.  

I don’t understand why they can’t be more communicative!!!   Truly would love someone in the know to enlighten me as to why they can’t just tell us."
Agreed - A train.
"Did he leave his laptop there? If not, I doubt it was an accident, pursue it as a crime."
Late night food delivery
It’s up and down.
"Whole building needs exterminator on same week to do initial kill, then everyone leaves lots of combat around."

Most of these are run by the same people. 

Check out the special ethnic ones with corporate or govt sponsors. They have more unique stalls and performances too."
"It’s amazing to me that JetBlue can’t track this guy to his gate and figure out who he is by what flight he got on.

Have you contacted Port Authority Police?"
Calling a hero..a hero. I live in god forsaken Westchester now and every time I have to ask for an Italian WEDGE I die a little inside. WTF is a wedge?!
My friends have all used Planned Parenthood. Wait times can be high.
"Breakfast: a croissant, sometimes also a donut, and sometimes a second croissant. 3-4 shots of espresso, depending on how long it takes me to dial in the perfect shot. A tall glass of Oat Milk. 

Lunch: cheese danish and a salad from Sweetgreen, every single work day. More espresso, preferably over ice. 

Yep, I work at a coffee shop."
"If you’re new to the job application process, just know it’s a numbers game. When applying for my current job, my numbers were as follows:

Applied for 468 jobs - both higher and lower than my qualifications

Got contacted by less than half of them (rejections or next steps) ~200

Got face time with less than a quarter of those ~45

Got next round with less than a quarter of those ~10

And finally landed up with 3 offers on the table

All of this over the course of about 4-5 months. Less than 1% success rate but a job is a job ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Physicians can refuse to provide abortions if they choose, but they are still ethically bound and responsible for providing a referral for the patient to get the procedure done elsewhere. It's irresponsible, unethical, and dangerous to leave this person high and dry especially with a higher risk pregnancy! 

I know it's easier said than done, OP, but please find a new OB! There's tons out there that'll make sure you're safe.

Source: am doctor"
Then they belong in another profession and OP should name and shame the doctor.
"I don't have direct experience with the Intrepid's free night, but having gone to MoMA and Guggenheim free nights, you're in for a treat!  If you happen to like waiting in lines and crowds, that is.

Rule of thumb: free stuff in NYC = some sort of shit show."
"Do they have powers? Only in their minds. Is unsurprisingly they have been prone to violence. They used to harass my exs brothers and their friends when they would hang out at the park on McDonald Ave.

The NYPD is politically motivated to ignore them, or take limited actions (unless serious violence occurs and the media gets involved). The hasidic population is a solid voting block, so city management appeases them. 

I'm Jewish btw, so please don't interpret this as antisemitic. It's well known."
How else do you describe walking begrudgingly to a location with a heavy or oddly shaped object (the object can sometimes just be your own sorry excuse for a human body)?
There's so much slang that I'm discovering is NY only
Ask for a lease rider. They might already have one on hand. It seems fairly common in my experience. I don't currently have a pet but asked for one anyway since the place was specifically advertised as per friendly.
"Pizza by the slice 

&amp;#x200B;

No where else is it a big thing - you usually have to buy the full pie &amp; it's not typical to walk in to grab a slice and leave, you usually have to order ahead. Ah, I'm so glad I learned the way of pizza by the slice."
Not to along ago someone made a post on legaladvice about one of these 'jewish police' because he became a new resident in one of those neighborhoods that have them and they would constantly harass him and his friends to try to force them to move out! This poor guy didn't know what to do anymore and he tried calling the police and even the police refused to help. It's disgusting how they can be above the law. How isn't this stuff on the news everywhere and isn't being made a big deal about especially in todays era where racism gets a lot of attention.
"[Erik Bern](https://erikbern.com/2016/04/04/nyc-subway-math.html) has done the math: you should leave. 

&gt;The interesting conclusion is that after about five minutes, the longer you wait, the longer you will have to wait. If you waited for 15 min, the median additional waiting time is another 8 minutes. But 8 minutes later if the train still hasn’t come, the median additional waiting time is now another 12 minutes.

&gt;So when should you give up waiting? One way to think about it is how much time you think it’s worth waiting. The time you already waited is “sunk cost” so it doesn’t really matter. What matters is how much additional time you are willing to wait. Let’s assume you want to optimize for a wait time that’s less than 30 min in 90% of the cases. Then the max time you should wait is about 11 minutes until giving up (this is at the point where the yellow line cuts the 30 min mark)."
"100 of them ?? That’s more then a problem you’re going to be able to fix . If you’re seeing 100 there could be 400-1,000 in your apartment . That’s grounds for burning down the building .  They tend to hide and try to stay out of the spotlight . But when you see 100 of them that means where they hide is packed with other ones ."
I’ve heard the Planned Parenthood in Long Island City is terrific
"**Theatre Gays**: Harlem / Washington Heights / Hamilton Heights

**Rich Theatre Gays:** Hell's Kitchen

**Old Gays:** Greenwich Village / West Village

**Young fashion/art Gays:** Bushwick / Ridgewood / Bed-stuy

**Gays with Children:** Brooklyn Heights / park slope

**Ballroom Gays:** Fordham Heights / South Bronx / Harlem

**Miscellaneous Gays:** Astoria

&amp;#x200B;

... But in all seriousness, IME NYC is way gayer than Chicago. All types of queer folk are in all neighborhoods. You'll be good around any of the universities or Bushwick, Ridgewood, Williamsburg, East Village, etc etc."
Had no idea Jews didn’t live everywhere. Grew up with mostly Jews and when I met people from Iowa who never met a Jew I couldn’t believe it.
If there’s one thing to be said about Yankees fans it’s that the love taking the D
"Breakfast is always Oatmeal with either fresh or frozen berries and agave syrup. Usually holds me over until lunch. 

Lunch is usually a salad I packed from home, with either salmon or tofu and some balsamic, or a mock turkey sandwich with greens, and vegan cheese. 

Work snack usually an apple and PB."
"My goooooooood. Nothing tosses my sanity more than tube closures. Crazy how backwards that city is -- You can grab a gin and soda in a can, drink on the street -- but bars close early af, they don't understand doubles, and the tube closes too early!!!

Luckily their buses are great, but smh so right more like ""City that sleeps 'round midnight."""
"Planned Parenthood in Soho, off Bleeker street."
"Beaverton is a small and affluent suburb, which allows for a stronger culture of civic accountability. The anonymity of New York means that people would feel less pressure to take care of the shit they borrowed."
This. How is the OB not providing a referral?
In New York i remember in school we’d call them book bags. When i started going to school In Massachusetts they called it back packs
"Late night anything. Even in bigger cities. DC is so dead compared to NYC after 11. Philly less so, but still no late night delivery..."
"You moved to a neighborhood where this is culturally normal and you moved into a first floor apartment, neither of which is a smart thing for someone who can’t sleep through it. I’d suggest heavy curtains, a noise machine or investing in high quality ear plugs."
"Tons of people. Not every place is good for every person. Some prefer this city; some don’t. There isn’t anything wrong with having a preference and lots of people leave NYC every year for something different.

Not sure how much luck you’ll have here - as most of the subscribers and commenters are residents - but they are out there."
"Man I feel for you. My girlfriend battled roaches at her last apartment and ultimately moved out because they problem was largely unfixable after 8 months of exterminators. I’m sure the place is super cheap but if you can, leave. Bugs are a dealbreaker for me."
Wouldn't say hole in the wall but the Donut Pub is probably my favorite in the city. Huge selection of classics and fun twists on originals.
