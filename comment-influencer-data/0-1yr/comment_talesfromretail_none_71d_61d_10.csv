"Sorry to say, but this post is in violation. I'll be back for the bounty."
"Print a sheet that says exactly what the warning is and have them sign it before you go ahead and reset. Date, time, signature. 
A non-repentence agreement."
Did she really think you wouldnt recognize her and know what she was doing?
Good on the team leader for not jumping on that register to appease him.
"If there ever comes a day that I look a store employee dead in the eye and say “the customer is always right”, know that my brain has been infested with space maggots and are controlling my entire body. Kill me."
"Fuck. This would've been my worst nightmare, I can't do my business in public toilets no matter how desperate I get. Someone trying to talk to me would only make it worse."
"Probably.


The single biggest issue seems to be the whole 'not seeing each other as people'.. so even if they see each other once a week for years the customer sees the retail worker as faceless and interchangeable.. they see the uniform, not the person.


And the other way around.. customers become blobs with money.


The same kind of anonymity that makes road rage possible."
You were quick on your *feet*
You need to call the police and report the threat.
"I hate impatient customers, we had a guy wait 30 seconds and already he huffed and tried to put cash on the desk and leave with the items. We stopped him and made him pay properly."
"Imagine if you had to walk away for some reason and a colleague unknowingly sold it for a dollar.

If I owned an item that I put in my mouth, I wouldn't leave it where a stranger could touch it. You never know where they've been and if they wash properly. I assume most do, but if you meet the one.... I hope you found a new place to keep it."
No God please no
"I absolutely HATE it when managers/whoever just give in to a customers demands cos they cba. 

We can’t reward bad behaviour like that, they’ll just continue to be arseholes"
"&gt;She proceeded to not know how to put her chip debit card in the reader.

I hope you were right there at her elbow to HLEP."
"You: WARNING

Lady: Whatever just do it.

You: \*Does it\* 

Lady: OMG YOU DIDN'T WARN MEEEE

You: Yes I did. Camera proof. 

Lady: WHAT IS THIS TRAVESTY OF UNPROFESSIONALISM CUSTOMER WINS OVER CAMERA I WILL CALL CORPORATE

You: k"
"I make people reset their own phones. They have to physically push the button. I will tell them how, but I won't do it for them. That is after the warning I give, and the huge warning Apple/Google gives. And most of the time it is for trade ins when they already have a new phone so they know everything is transfered."
What was it that sign said? Employees are human beings and not robots and may act unpredictably when startled or yelled at? Something along those lines.
Has to be pops I've only ever seen people acting that ridiculous over pops
"I've had that happen too, or they micromanage what all goes in a bag which slows things down so much

*puts a pineapple and a can into the same bag

""Oh no that's obviously too heavy for me take something out how do you think I can carry that?""

...

*bags a single can..."
"""due to a shortage of robots, some of our staff are human and thus react unpredictability when abused or under pressure"""
I can’t believe that store policy allows her to not purchase them after she requested the cut.
"He wasn't upset about the sandwich, he was upset about something that only existed in his mind. Maybe he imagined it was an insult against him personally, maybe it was something so nonsensical we could never guess what it was."
"After coming out the stall you should have shaken her hand, arm around the shoulder, lots of touching and stroking saying in a friendly tone how nice it is that she feels no boundaries and doesn't think anyone needs personal space and that staff don't deserve any respect when doing personal business.

Then wash your hands using lots of soap, picking at your nails saying how you think your finger went through the last sheet of toilet paper"
"Remember, you're not a person. You're a robot programmed to know everything about everything."
"The descriptions were so vivid, I really felt like I was there. You honestly type better than most English speakers. :)

Also, little gnocchi sounds adorable."
"Yes! Apparently one time a customer got mad at my coworker for how she was bagging and she said under her breath, “I should just do it myself.” So my coworker said “okay,” and proceeded to put all of her items on the counter for the customer to put away."
"Nah, that’s you push out a fart so loud it sounds like an off-key tuba and see what they say then!"
"If you could only override the till, and show her the price with the voucher, she'd suddenly see the light and proclaim your wisdom to all...

Actually she'd screech that you are trying to cheat her, throw the vitamin bottles at your head, and lie to corporate, but I prefer my version."
Jokes on her i'm the only one in the department that prices remnants
"People done read. What you need to do is have them write a paragraph, repeating the data loss outcome. Then they need to say out loud “I understand that this will delete all my data and cannot be undone”

And they will still complain"
"I'm like 99% sure I work at the same place. It sucks but we work with boomers so 'the customer is always right' is true there a lot more than other places. Piles of fabric thrown everywhere are common, it's a madhouse on weekends.

Sucks because fabric doesn't have sku numbers printed on it."
BINGO!
"""Most people your age know how to use debit cards though."""
"This.

Also, if dude comes in again, alert your manager if you're feeling uncomfortable."
Since when do blood members carry ID stating that they are a member of the bloods?
"This always amazes me. At my store, we don't keep tills in the registers. Normally, if the light is off and no one is at that register, there's no till in it and it's signed off. 


Last year near Thanksgiving, we were slammed busy and shorthanded. I was taking care of customers at the service desk when a 50-ish year old woman comes storming up and says, ""is someone coming to check us out?? We've been waiting here for 15 minutes!!"" I look over and she and her husband have their entire cart unloaded onto an empty register. No person, no light on. I told her there wasn't even a till in that register and she would have to pack up and move to a lane that was actually open. That ended up being my first complaint ever from a customer. Nut seriously, how stupid can you be?!"
"People give me the dirtiest looks when I leave to go on my break. Like, sorry for being human and wanting to sit down for 15 minutes after hours of standing."
Okay but why did it ever seem like a good idea to place your personal property in a box of sellable items at all? You can't put it on a shelf under the counter or something?
