"Beyoncé “beyhive”, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj/Cardi B have some horrible fanbases. Beyoncé has got to have the worst fan base out of all. She used to make great music imo but fell off with this singing rap mess and the presenting of herself as a goddess. Anytime someone acts like she’s a anything less than perfect, they get bombarded with angry lowlifes with nothing else better to do than to defend a girl that doesn’t care about them. The comments irk me too, like “WE STAN A HUMBLE QUEEN 💅”. The wild thing is that some of the people doing this are grown adults. "
"Also people who stan for popstars and 'go in' on anyone who disses their fave. Like Beyonces 'Beyhive', Mariah Careys 'Lambs', Lady Gagas 'Monsters' etc. "
