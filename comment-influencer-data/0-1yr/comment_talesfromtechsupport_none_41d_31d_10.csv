"There is a family near where my mom lives that only turns on WIFI when they absolutely need it.  The mom thinks she is allergic to radio signals, so they have a computer hard wired with Ethernet and another wifi box that they only plug in when someone needs it, and the mom gets out of the house.  It cracks me up because her neighbors are close enough that when you do a wifi scan there are several signals within range.  It's pretty nuts.  Good story!"
If you want some more entertainment regarding wifi signals go look up review for wifi/NFC blocking phone cases.
"&gt; i am ALLERGIC TO RADIO SIGNALS!!!

&gt; we proceeded the call over the MB

Next time this happens, you should point out to them that their mobile 'phone uses similar frequencies to WiFi. Or that even if she doesn't use a mobile herself, everyone elses' mobiles and the cell towers are still filling the air with RF. Not to mention other people's WiFi, radio and TV broadcasts, her microwave, and probably a thousand other forms of RF around the 2GHz range."
"&gt; Oh, if you have knowlage about this? then you should know that the radio signal outmitted by our router is at standard 2.4Ghz \[...\]

don't feed the beast! ;)"
"I forget where this happened.  But there was a petition for a city to turn off a cell tower because it was making everyone ""sick.""  When all the ""sick people"" showed up to complain, they found out the tower had been off for a year or more."
*LIES! No radio signals come through my house unless I actually turn on a radio!*
"&gt; So I rebooted the PC into the BIOS and set it to auto-boot 30 minutes before they open each day

Now _that_ is how you prevent this from happening again. Both for user-error and for power-outage. Good job."
"There might be people that get sick from radio wave or other modern conveniences, but almost all of them are just hypochondriac conspiracy theorists looking to complain about something. The rest of them are people who doctors can't figure out if modern life is making them sick or it is something else."
Please do! This was a fun read!
Updoot for the absolutely perfect username lol.
Clearly the only solution is to disconnect all electricity from her house and lock herself in a Faraday cage.
"This was when i was less mature in my techsupport and i don't anymore :)  
There is no use arguing with some people. Still, it was kinda funny ;)"
"&gt; galena

Because nothing says ""healthy"" like lead sulfide!"
Yep my boss told someone similar that it was the same band as a lot of homes and baby monitors and they hung up instantly.
At least this story had a peaceful resolution. Not like those other stories I read where people get offended because you ask them a simple question about the computer.
"Most routers have a switch built in and act as a single point in/out of that switch's LAN. A switch on it's own would put each device on your network directly on the Internet. Routers act as a sort of basic firewall.

If you want to get really technical, we can get into the nitty gritty of Routers/Switches/Modems/etc... but it gets complicated and there's always a little overlap due to how frequently the devices are put all into one appliance."
"&gt; FM: She used hers too. We have deals to print and you are stopping us from doing out job!!!

you are a better person than i am. i would have told them ""well iut certainly sucks to be you then. perhaps if you did your job you would have what you need, Lack Of Planning On Your Part Does Not Constitue An Emergency On Mine LOPOYPDNCAEOM"""
"The IT crowd to a T. ""Have you tried turning it off and on again? Is it plugged in?"" Lol. 1"
Our house plants are on a ledge so they stay in the sun even when the blinds are drawn.
"I got this from HR once:

""Well, if you ask me for a straight answer, then I shall say that, as far as we can see, looking at it by and large, taking one thing with another in terms of the average of departments, then in the final analysis it is probably true to say, that at the end of the day, in general terms, you would probably find that, not to put too fine a point on it, there probably wasn't very much in it one way or the other. As far as one can see, at this stage."""
"I was gonna ask what a 201 was, but I figured it out.

What does around, comes around. Don't piss off your IT support folks. You'll find we have all kinda of ways to make your life difficult."
"Rule 1.  Customers always lie.  

""Of course, I pressed the power button!""  

Presses power button.  

""Is that what that big button on the front does?"""
"Weren't we getting into the definitions of these devices? They are often put into one box, but it doesn't mean they are one thing"
"The product in question btw is some £30 sticker that ""turns harmful radiation into life boosting energy""

You stick it on your phone or tablet and it supposedly stops radiation"
Not exactly... Modem is what gets you access to the internet. Router is how you share that internet connection with multiple devices.
"Because they're put into single appliances the terms become overloaded. 

The term ""Router"" may refer to a standalone router, a router w/ x-port switch, a router w/ x-port switch and wifi, a router w/ x-port switch, wifi, and modem, etc..."
"That's adorable, /u/hotwifeslutwhore"
"It might have been luck, but it's the kind of luck that comes from persistence and skill. I'm impressed!"
"I always have to mentally translate POS from ""piece of shit"" to ""point of sale"" as well.  Although it certainly often seems apropos."
"Modem is what gets you access to the internet. Router is how you share that internet connection with multiple devices in your home (usually over some kind of built in Wifi).

Lots of ISP's now have a combo Modem+Router that simplifies the setup to a single device."
That is epic.
She told them it was on because she's an user and they always effing lie.
Wear medial exam gloves and never worry about what you touch....most times
"Yes, I would not have gone the extra route to remake a PC to suit.  I can get you the parts but it will be a few days/week.  Until then, you will have to make do with the 20 inch displays."
"From the consumer's point of view, yes. But from technical standpoint, not really. They're still multiple devices put into one thing"
"My last car was $250, bought it off a coworker because it needed a clutch and a transaxle, which he was quoted $4500 for... $60 at pick n pull, and it even had a new clutch on it. Spent a weekend putting the clutch in (Corollas are fun when you don't have a lift or a transmission jack), was a significant upgrade being an 05 with 125k on it from my previous daily, a 99 Corolla with 312k on it :-P!"

We had a corporate exec as well as a plant manager do the same thing.  We implemented empty trash on exit one day...turned it off the next.
"He had English classes in school, of course, which taught vocabulary and grammar. He didn't learn the language from Cartoon Network, just the American pronunciation."
Maybe she should move to [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Radio_Quiet_Zone)
If you call it a gateway like we do then you don't have to worry about it :)
Mmmm...
