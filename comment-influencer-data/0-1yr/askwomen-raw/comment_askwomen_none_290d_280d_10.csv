0,"&gt;What are some things that guys misinterpret from women as ""she's interested in me""?

Women service sector workers being friendly to them in the course of doing their jobs."
1,"He seemed a bit shy but goofy,smart and genuinely kind when he approached me, so I agreed to go out and we hit it off at first. Deep, meaningful conversation about our personal challenges, him quickly meeting my friends and me being the first person he called after a family emergency. We were both pretty vulnerable, but things were seemingly progressing somewhat well.

One day he was on Tinder in bed next to me and when called on it, he said that dating me had made him realize that he needed more confidence and experience with women and thus needed to date a lot more different people, but that he only fucked the others at their houses, so I was obviously his no1. I freaked, cried and broke things off - he called me the next day to casually ask me out to the new Hunger Games movie.

I got an STD-screening the next week - he harassed me at work for another 6 months. :)"
2,"I remember reading a post on reddit a long while ago about some guy who was having problems booking an plane ticket and used the website's ""chat"" feature to try to solve the issue. He became convinced that the woman answering his messages was flirting with him because she used a smiley face emoji and didn't exit the conversation once the issue was resolved. Having worked in places like that, we were told not to be the one to exit the conversation first in case the customer has an additional query that they forgot to mention. This guy ""missed"" her and wondered if she was thinking about him too. The answer is: she absolutely is not."
3,"One time I went tubing down a river in my small town and it turned into a day from hell.  

So I lived in a town of 900 population for a number of years up in northern Minnesota. There was a river in the town that didnt seem to get much tubing action.  Our family used to come up and we would go tubing down a river that was a hour away.  This year we decided to go local. So my FIL drove us there in nothing but swim suits.  We had no phones and no shoes.  He dropped us off at the bridge and drove 20 minutes away to where we would get out to wait for us. 

Well we jumped in and everything was going great.  The water was deep and moving slow but not bad.  As we were going a long, we came to a large bever dam. We had gone too far to turn back so we tried to crawl over it with our tubes. The other side was horrible. Muddy swallow water that smelt like poop.  Every step we took, we sank in about 2 feet of mud.  Finally the water was deeper, but the river had soo many trees down on it. We had to crawl over them.  By this time we were out for about a hour, with no end in sight. We kept going because we had no choice.  

It was about 80 degrees that day and dreadfully humid.  The horse flies came out and started attacking our heads. The guys got hit more that us girls, probably because of our hair. So as we float as a snail pace, the river starts geting more and more narrow. There are these bushes on either side hanging down into the water. As we start brushing up against them, HUGE SPIDERS start falling all over us.  We were all screaming trying not to touch the sides.  It was horrifying!! 

We get to an electric fence that is hovering over and across the stream at about 2 feet We can hear it buzzing so we knew it was on.  We slid into the water and pushed our tubes under it and prayed we didnt touch it.

Finally we get through the spiders about 2 hours in, we get too a large tree down over the river. We cant go over it because it's too big. So we all walk out about 30ft in waist high brush , barefoot and practically naked, to walk around this tree.  As we get back to the river, we are picking ticks off us...yes ticks. You would think it doesnt get any worse, but it does.  


So finally back in the river, and by this point we are all dying for this nightmare to be over.   Also it's getting late. It was as about 8pm but in northern Minnesota summer, its light until 10-11pm.  The mosquitos start to come out. So now we have mosquitoes, spiders, ticks and horseflies.   The river starts to become very S like and its taking forever to get to where ever the F we were going.  About 3 hours in we finally see his car.  We cant get to him though because of the curves of the river. So for 45 more minutes we can see him but keep going. We finally come wobbling out of the river soo thankful it was over. As we are getting out we realized that we were covered in leeches.  Yup. We pulled them off and we are all bleeding from scratches and covers in bug bites.

He laughed and said ""I got a bit worried there!! You were gone for 3 hours!!  Thought you might be having too much fun!""

It was by far the most torturing experience of my life. Also I was terrified that we were going to have to spend the night out there.


Edit: just realized this thread is all about men.  Lol oops. Well it was my husband's idea to tube this river so NEVER AGAIN. Lol. 

Edit 2: eek my first Gold! Thanks guys!  

Edit 3: I dont want to say where I lived for privacy, but this is the river!

4,"Being employed in a bar and serving him. Dude, I’m required to be polite. You are older than my dad and I can smell you from here. I do not have a thing for you. "
5,"He never closes any chips, cereal, cookie packages after using them. I’m starting to think he likes stale food more than fresh. "
6,"I have a young male coworker who's rapport with customers really impresses me. He remembers hundred different people's names, can talk to them about anything, instantly make them feel welcome. I've told him many times this is one of his strengths.

One night, I decide to try and incorporate a bit of his techniques and the first guy I do it to instantly thinks I'm coming on to him, then gets mad when I won't give up my number. Now I'm back to being a robot. I just wanted to be good! :("
7,Promised I’d never marry bc I could never possibly poop in the same house a male was in. 
8,"All the guys I have known or dated that felt it necessary to label themselves ""nice guys"" turned out to absolutely awful humans.  Either they had a bad temper, horrible morals, or just didn't want to take ""no"" for answer.  One even turned out to be an emotionally abusive alcoholic.  

The actual nicest guys I've dated or called friends were the ones who didn't feel the need to label themselves ""nice guy"". In fact, the best of them usually warned me and others that they were not all that nice, but always turned out to be the sweetest, most understanding, appreciative, and kind guys I've had the pleasure of knowing. "
9,"Had a ""nice guy"" on tinder who didn't make it to date for the following reason.

He lived in a different city so he insisted on an all day date (lives about 50 mins away). I said I'm not comfortable subscribing to 8+ hours with someone I hadn't met yet, but he kept insisting I had to make it worth his while to come through. At this point I said I can't see it going anywhere and it was putting me under pressure and that made me feel a little uncomfortable, that realistically, it may not work out so let's just leave it. 

So then he says he's gonna book a hotel and come through. Explained that's sweet but it's making me uncomfortable. So he says I can have the bed and hell be a gentleman and have the sofa... I explained that he seems to have the wrong idea, I'm not going to a hotel with him and I feel uncomfortable, I don't want to meet. He continues to press, saying he is nice guy, he won't  make me have sex if I don't want to. I say I don't want to. I don't want to go to a hotel. I don't want to meet. It's too much pressure, and for someone I've not met, I feel uneasy, thanks, good luck with your search...

But apparently I need to give him a chance. He's willing to come all this way. I say no. He keeps finding new things to message me. Uses my phone number to add my snap chat and says he can see what street I'm on. At this point I start feeling very uneasy. I didn't know I had location on. I block him. He messaged on something else so I say I've got back with my ex. ( I see my ex a lot, we are good friends, he's happy to ""have a word"") so he starts going on about my ex had his chance and blew it, he is a much nicer guy than my ex, he will treat me like a princess and worship me and my ex has blown it etc etc. I tell him this is my choice. Thanks and goodbye. Please don't try to message me on anything else as it's not appropriate and I've already blocked on 3 things.


Fast forward 4 months and I move cities. I get an Instagram message. It's the nice guy saying he's seen my on bumble in this new city and even though we haven't matched it must not have worked out with my ex. He's using Instagram and can see I'm near the station (Is that even a thing?!) And we should go on that date that I owe him.

Blocked again. Had a friend stay over that night."
10,"Letting a guy pick me up for a first date. It forces you to stay even if you're uncomfortable, and lets the guy know where you live, which is a disadvantage if the date doesn't go well. I let a guy pick me up last month (something I never do) because my car wouldn't start and I wish I hadn't. "

12,Accidentally making eye contact on the train.
13,"Went on and on about what a great, compassionate guy he was. He was actually just your garden variety, abusive psycho.

He once said to me: “I wish you had been abused so you would realise how great I am”. What the fuck.  Who says that?!"
14,Take a laxative without drinking a bunch of water. I thought I was going to die
15,"leaves half-finished glasses of water around the house -- it's like living in the movie, *signs*."
16,"I’ll never beg anyone to stay ever again. If you don’t want to be in my life, I don’t want you here. "
17,"Thats next level nice some would even say hes a ""great guy"""
18,"Looking at him

Being polite and friendly

Being alive nearby

"
19,"I promised myself that I would never cry over a boy when I was eleven.  


Ah, to be that naive again. "
20,"My husband loves to sing. The issue here is that he is tone deaf, and when he sings it sounds like a seagull is being strangled to death. He only does it when he's happy so I try to not grimace, but man he is truly terrible at singing. He also never knows the words to songs, so he'll just belt out some random note instead of a word he doesn't know. He's a total goof and I love him. "
21,"He went out bowling with his friends and then when he came home he complained to me that for the first time in his life a hot girl had hit on him while he was out, and he was unlucky enough to actually have a girlfriend. He seemed genuinely sad he had to turn her down, and expected me to be greatful he did it. "
22,"“Emotional incest” 

It’s difficult to define and pin down but it’s a kind of emotional abuse that can look healthy from the outside, like you’re just close to your parents or “best friends,” but adults unloading adult concerns onto children makes those children grow up putting their needs last and always feeling inadequate. It makes you feel like the emotional parent of your parent, and steals your childhood. It explained why I instinctively withdraw from my parents when they want to talk to me. They turn me into their therapist and it feels gross. It becomes an easy dynamic to fall into when when parents have a strained relationship and/or are going through a divorce. 

Gilmore Girls glorifies this entire dynamic. "
23,"The man does not sit down.

He eats standing up. He watches TV standing up. When he's working at his computer, he gets up every few minutes to pace.

It's not a big deal for the most part, but it makes me anxious."
24,"He proposed to me after we worked on a group project. When I turned down this guy I barely knew and definitely never dated he stalked and harrassed me for about half a year until he found his next ""true love"". He was a serial proposer. "
25,"I didn’t actually give him a chance, but...I was talking to my guy friend, Andrew, in the break room at work one day and another guy jumps in the conversation with a “hey man, what’s up” to Andrew. I assumed they must be coworkers.

After that he proceeds to stop by my office every night “on his way out” to make increasingly awkward small talk. I mention that I have a boyfriend (true), but he keeps coming anyway looking for anything to talk about. “Hey, (pointing to the cartoon on the box of cereal on my desk), it looks like we’re both into anime!” Nope, I’m just into generic Lucky Charms, dude. I try to be friendly. Then he escalates into things like “Does your boyfriend come take you out to lunch every week? No? You deserve someone who treats you better than that.” 

He offers to build me a better desk. I decline and get a “jeez, I’m just trying to do something nice for you.” I tell him these conversations are making me uncomfortable and when I’m at work I’m working. He gives me a “jeez, I was just saying hi on my way out.” I close my office door. He keeps coming and knocking. I keep the door closed and wave him off. He gives me flowers for Valentines Day.

I go to my friend Andrew and ask him if he’ll tell his coworker to fuck off. Turns out Andrew has only ever talked to him that one time in the break room. We look him up in the company directory and the guy works two floors below me, so I’m not on his “way out.” Eventually I called corporate security and they had a talk with him and his boss and deactivate his badge access to my floor."
26,"He tried to rape me because I ""belonged to him and only him"" now. He thought a girlfriend couldn't say no. I ended up putting him in the hospital."
27,"I love how almost all of these are dating/sex stories and I was just going to say staying up all night cramming for a test. Slept right through my alarm, missed the test."
28,"He leaves dishes to ""soak"" for so long and when I finally wash them, he acts like he wanted to do it. Annoys the shit out of me. "
29,Accept a pity date from someone I know I have zero interest in. It was awkward as fuck from start to finish and ended with him groping me.
30,I was 16. He was the same age. He tried to pin me down in my bed so I kicked him in the stomach and shoved him off the bed. I started beating him with a baseball bat I kept from my childhood so it was pretty small. I only broke a few fingers and did some damage to his jaw as far as I was told from some mutual friends. I never bothered pushing for details. I kicked him out of my house and just never spoke to him again. I should have pressed charges but I didn't know if I would get in trouble for hitting him with a bat. As far as I know he never really told anyone what happened and never really made up a story but I wouldn't really know if he ever did because I moved out only a month later and eventually stopped talking to everyone there.
31,"Not well. He was funny and friendly in public, but turned into a different person as soon as we were behind closed doors. He was basically your textbook abuser - manipulative, controlling, and demanding. He wanted to do some really weird and degrading (to me) sex stuff and acted like I was the psycho for not wanting to. He'd make angry comments like ""I'm just trying to be romantic and YOU keep freaking out"". I got out of the relationship before he could hit or rape me, but no question that was what the future held. Oh, and he still insisted that he was the nicest guy I'd ever meet.  "
32,"He has giant lizard feet. I swear to God, I'm not making this up. His feet are entirely made up of dry ass lizard skin. And when we watch tv at night he always whips his socks off. Then he sits in his recliner and drags those devilish dipods back and forth over one another. Yes, there he crouches, perched menacingly on his branch.... Chair! I mean he SITS in his CHAIR.... moving his scaly lizard feet back and forth, baaaack and forth, baaaack and forth, creating a giant pile of dry skin in the floor. And that SOUND! Dear GOD the SOUND! It's like a dry tree branch on a cheese grater! SHUDDER!! 

BUT I'M FINE. EVERYTHING IS FINE. "
33,"I promised myself I’d never smoke, but then smoked for over 20 years. I’ve quit now though. "
34,"&gt; he won’t make me have sex if I don’t want to

So kind of him to offer to not rape you in a hotel you don’t want to be at in the first place 🙄"
35,"When I was 10 I promised myself I'd kill myself before reaching 30. Figured that would be the absolute longest I'd be able to stand being alive.

I'm now 31, no longer suicidal, and realized I was sad for a very long time and just finally coming out of it and becoming myself. Medicine for mental illness is a wonder of modern times."
36,I thought I would probably end up with a shitty person because I had a messed up relationship with my dad so I assumed my “daddy issues” would cause me to be with someone just as bad. Instead I scored a freaking amazing man who is nothing like the men in my family. He is so much better than anything I could ever imagine for myself and I feel incredibly lucky to have found someone who saved me from the shitty life I had and gave me a new family. 
37,"Never gonna read into someone’s behavior to try to find a silver lining. People show who they are by what they do, it’s really *that* simple. "
38,"That all my tattoos would be sUuUuUuUpEr mEaNiNgFuL. The more you get, the less you care about that. "
39,"He leaves a river on bathroom countertops. I can only figure that he fills both hands with water and pours it on the counter when he goes to get soap, like he's giving an offering to the soap dispenser. 🙏

I just started putting a towel down where the river usually is 🤷🏼‍♀️  It's not worth bringing up, he's wonderful."
40,"Me:  Are you hungry?  I was gonna make randomDinnerFood for dinner.

Husband:  that sounds good but I'm not really hungry right now.  Can we eat a bit later?

Me: Yea, for sure.  When would you like to eat?

Husband: how about half an hour?  


My husband seems to think that dinner just appears in a flash.  "
41,"Whenever I’m doing something on my computer he just stares at the screen, making no comments. It’s unnerving. He’s actually watching me type this right now, not saying anything."
42,"My ex husband would beat me over the smallest things, lock me in the basement, force me to have sex with him, choke me when he didn't want to hear me speak...It didn't matter if I was holding our daughter or not. I was a living, breathing punching bag. I had a rough start to not only motherhood, but adulthood as well (I just turned 20 a month prior to getting pregnant and was living in my car at the time). I could go on but you won't want me to.

I met my current boyfriend 11 days after my divorce was finalized. He was a single father. His son's mother took off when their son was 2. My daughter's father took off when she was 3 months old. 

He is the only person in my life whose actions have not make me feel like a burden or a worthless human being. He's kind, his touch is kind, his words are kind, he treats my daughter like his own, even when we have our squabbles, my daughter and I are always safe. He's emotionally supportive, he listens and genuinely just wants a happy life with me. He's more of a man than I thought even existed. An added bonus for faithfulness too! His son is 8 and my daughter is 2 now. We've been together a little over a year, we plan on moving in together once my lease is up and I couldn't be happier with the family we have made. 

Chivalry is not dead. I promise. "
43,"A classmate (G) in college and I met up to peer review for our senior semester three or four times. Years later, I ran into a mutual friend (K) and she said she was so glad that G and I dated or else we (K&amp;I) never would have been friends. I was like, ""dated?"" and she was like, ""yeah I remember G always talking about how you guys were dating in the last semester!""

o.o"
44,"Staying at a job for 18 years because I kept thinking it would get better eventually. 

I finally realized I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with my former employer. It wasn’t me. It was them. 

I moved on and am finally actively appreciated for my contributions. "
45,"I've had a couple-

The first being that I experienced trauma. I always brushed off the emotional and physical abuse because other people had it worse. It took a long time for me acknowledge that trauma is traumatic, regardless of how *bad* it is.

Second being that I resist truly processing and working through my stuff because I'm afraid. I'm afraid of who I'll be without my trauma and baggage. My entire identity up to this point has been shaped by this trauma and I have no idea what my life will look like without it. "
46,He refuses to talk to store employees when he can't find something. He'd rather call me and ask what he can buy instead.
47,"He makes this loud “CHYEAH!” sound, like Jay-Z at the beginning of Umbrella, and every time I hear it my brain shrivels in on itself. 

Update: since informing him that his exploits have led to one of my highest rated comments, he has doubled the rate of “CHYEAH”.

I am thrilled, as you can imagine. "
48,"Thoughts are not facts. Repeated over and over again.

Edit: WOW my phone has been blowing up all afternoon with replies and I absolutely adore the positivity. Thanks internet!"
49,"Never again will I agree to additional roles with the promise of a salary increase without getting it in writing. Doubled my workload, didn't get paid a dime."
50,He rips open boxes or bags that have a built in opening. 
51,"&gt;I ended up putting him in the hospital.

I'd like to hear more about this."
52,"I was 16, and working at a horse barn. 

One of the ultra rich ladies had a ""house boy"" (that's what she actually called him OMG!)  that would come and assist her at the barn with whatever she needed. 

His car wouldn't start one day. I offered to give him a jump start, it didn't work because there was something else wrong with the car. Oh well. that's the end, right?

He started calling every day, first to thank me for being so nice, then ""Just to talk."" I would get off the phone as soon as I could, but I didn't want to be rude, right??  He asked me how old I was. I told him the truth, that I was 16, thinking that would ""set him straight."" It didn't, and he cheerfully told me he was in his mid 30s. It was with a tone of like, ""Oh you like chocolate? well i like vanilla? Isn't funny that we are different yet get along so well......""  Fucking yikes. 

He kept asking me out on dates. I would try and politely refuse, again, don't want to be rude, do I?  I kept emphasizing I was still in high school and had little time for dates. He asked me if he could take me to prom.  I started to get scared then. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why this mid 30s guys wanted to be with a 16 year old loser with a curfew.  Wouldn't older women who like, didn't live with their parents be much more appealing??  Ug but he kept calling!

Finally, one day the phone rang, and a lot of the rich horse ladies were there, and they saw me panic and could tell something was up. I told them what was up. I will never forget this one woman marched over to the phone, it was that dude, she gave him the most epic scolding. Then she contacted security, (this place was very fancy with security gates)  and had him banned from the premises.  She also followed up with the lady who he was working for,and told her all about it. 

After she got off the phone with him, she sat me down and gave me a serious talking to about how to handle this shit in the future, that has served me very well in life.  I really appreciate those rich horse ladies for teaching me how to stand up for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;"
53,"I tried to pay for my coffee - he worked at the coffee stand. 

Idk it was weird. Apparently being polite whilst ordering my beverage meant it was a green light to try and ask for my number and then lean over the bloody counter and kiss me on the cheek as I was about to walk away. I was 19 at the time and had no clue what was happening. "
54,The way you inhale oxygen and exhale CO2 is so titillating
55,"Leaves toothpaste in the sink. Just wash it down man! Also leaves wrappers on end tables (candy, string cheese etc)

But he helps a lot in other ways so I just clean up after him with these two issues "
56,"Went on a brilliant date. I had the best time. He came back to mine because he said he couldn’t get a taxi. I put him on he sofa and he came into my room in the night and tried to have sex with me. I pretended to be asleep hoping he’d stop, he didn’t. He fell asleep with his hands on my boobs and his hard on on my back. Then in the morning he left and never spoke to me again. 
EDIT: thank you for all the messages. Luckily the troll messages were deleted before I saw them so they have not caused any bother. I did not report to the police although I am aware it Is assault, I was raped a few months prior to this and I fought back and ended up physically hurt so to me, lying still and shutting off felt the safest response. He was lovely and funny on the date. Just made me build an extra wall to protect myself further as I clearly have poor judgement on this stuff. Thanks to everyone for fighting back to trolls on my behalf x"
57,"Realizing my sudden, irrational irritation/anger was actually anxiety. I couldn't understand why certain things would set me off out of nowhere until then. "
58,There would probably be a lot more ridiculously padded codpieces.
59,"That I would never ask “how are you?”   I decided around 8 that nobody cares, wants the answer, or wants to discuss. It’s just wasted words and superficial politeness. 


Now I live in a condo “hi, how are you?” Every three feet. "
60,"It's silly but I was going to be an ice cream truck. If not that, then I'd own one. 

No interest in being a truck now, but it would have been cool. "
61,The people who are worried about being not nice are usually the ones most conscious of how they're acting. 
62,"I thought I wanted a super 'artsy' type who I could sing with, but ended up with a level-headed husband, who balances out my temperament (much better than what I had envisioned. So much less drama) and who can't sing a note! 😂"
63,"If he is really interested in me, then almost anything I do can be misinterpreted. Laughing when they say something funny. Being physically close even if it’s because we’re in a small space with lots of other people and it can’t be avoided. Smiling, just like I do to other people. Just generally being a friendly person. 

It’s just treating them like I treat other guys I’m friends with, but those guys won’t take these things as signs I’m interested in them because they aren’t hoping for signs that I’m interested. "
64,My boyfriend plays monopoly standing up and it is the most intimidating thing. Must be why he wins every game. 
65,"I once booked a small cabin in the off-season at a state park 90 minutes away. It was partially terrifying because NO ONE was around (and I watch a lot of scary movies!) But it was ultimately very freeing! Built a fire, wrote a lot, listened to a lot of music and just felt proud of myself for doing it. "
66,"One time, I refused to let a guy pick me up and met him at a restaurant instead. The date went really well, and when we finished eating, he suggested we go somewhere else for drinks. There were no bars in walking distance, so he offered to drive me to one he liked a couple miles away, and I agreed.

Drinks part of the night was also fine, right up until it was time to leave. In order to get back to my car, I needed him to give me a ride back to the restaurant. He refused to start his car unless I made out with him first. I repeatedly told him no, and he pushed anyway, until I was forced to give in, because he'd driven us to an unfamiliar neighborhood and I had no friends nearby that I could call. 

Then he couldn't understand why I jumped out of his car as soon as we got to the parking lot and didn't want to go on a second date."
67,"My perfectionism and fear of failure is really just a fear of being shamed because of the environment I grew up in.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words! I really wasn’t expecting so much support but it makes sense that this is something that a lot of people struggle with.

A little more context, I grew up in a well off family that’s always technically supported me (especially when I’m successful) but I also only got praise when I not only succeeded but exceeded success. Even though I’ve lucked out being pretty smart and have been able to charm my way out of any mistake/not ideal situation, my family is very much of the mindset that you’re either a winner or a lazy person and we (my family) are winners so we don’t accept any less.

The idea that I’m either in or out was and continues to be incredibly crippling. I have a really hard time starting things and when I do, I need to have complete control and every detail needs to be perfect. Even the most minor constructive criticism impacted my self esteem. That isn’t to say I’m not good at taking constructive criticism, I just really thrive on praise and strive for it in everything I do. When I do something well and I get the praise I’m looking for, it feels like I don’t deserve it because I always feel like there’s something I could have done better even when I know what I did was above and beyond what was expected.

As a kid, if I was ever less than perfect, I’d be the butt of my family’s toxically light hearted jokes for a long time and, in some cases, years. And anything I did wrong was met with absolute criticism of me as a person rather than performance. So my perfectionism and fear of failure became a defense mechanism against being shamed by my family and a preemptive effort to mitigate any potential shame from others - if I’m perfect and something goes wrong, I don’t need to worry about it because I did everything right.

In high school and college I did really well because I always perform when I’m up against the wall, but that was at the detriment of my mental health and well being. My identity became being profoundly smart (seemingly) without putting the effort in and that almost perpetuated it.

My breakthrough was realizing that I don’t need to be perfect to justify my existence and that sometimes you just need to do your best and improve where you can. I developed this idea to protect myself and it’s just not necessary anymore. Now that I can distance myself from that child paralyzed by fear of shame, it’s become a little easier to start things as I’m slowly realizing that it’s significantly less stressful to start something that might not be perfect and then improve on what I have.

Basically, my therapist and I work mainly on reparenting myself and distancing myself from what I’ve built up to shield myself from my family since I’m currently living 2700 miles away from them, am completely financially independent from them, and doing surprisingly well."
68,"Wow.


Wooooooooow.


Wow. "
69,I feel like penis pushup bras would become a thing. 
70,"I feel like they are all self explanatory so let’s just list them off:

* Never dating someone who’s extremely prone to jealousy again. They stop at nothing to guilt trip you (read: gaslighting, emotional abuse)
* Never dating someone who literally lives in their parents’ basement again. What was I thinking? In trying to prove I wasn’t shallow, I proved I was an idiot. He was 30 btw.
* Never dating someone with a tragic “one that got away” story again. Will not waste my time being constantly compared to someone else ever again.
* Never dating someone who mentions at every opportunity that they were “raised by women”, “raised to respect women”, etc. EVER again. I learned the hard way that saying that shit more than once is a Nice Guy™️ Specialty.

None of these are even the same person. If I didn’t feel like it was my life goal to find my person, I would have given up by now.

Edit: ITT: #notallbasementdwellers &amp; #notallwomenraised The amount of people offended by my personal choices as if it affects them is irritating. I’m turning off inbox replies now, I don’t care to defend my experiences anymore. If you’re personally bothered by #2 or #4, guess what? We (or me + your brother, SO, husband, father, other misc man in your life) are not a match! Crazy how that works!"
71,"He was always nice to me but very easily jealous anytime another guy spoke to me. We were just friends and only went out once yet he felt like he needed to make me feel bad whenever other guys gave me a little attention. He also had a horrible drinking problem and serious anger issues. And the whole time he was trying to woo me, he was also hooking up with his ex and ended up getting her pregnant. So yeah, no regrets about that."
72,"I honestly wasn’t sure I’d ever get married. I’m not a very romantic person, and my natural tendencies are to hide my feelings behind sarcasm and jokes. I also love what I do and work long hours so that I can be the best at it (someday). I just assumed all of my partners would be just as career-driven, not-at-all mushy, compartmentalizing person that I was. 

I ended up with a guy who’s a big teddy bear, and who works for a paycheck so that he can do what he wants outside those 37.5 hours a week. He’s been really patient while I learn that feelings (and corresponding vulnerability) are okay. He’s also made me believe in work-life balance a little more, and when push comes to shove, I choose him and our family over work (though I still work longer hours by a good stretch). He’s warm where I’m cold, and he’s made me adopt healthier relationship attitudes and behaviors. I firmly believe I found a partner who makes me a better version of myself. "
73,I have a first date tomorrow and was going back and forth about whether or not I’ll ask to meet him there. He seems like a sweetheart and really wants to go all out on being a gentleman but I think I’ll meet him there anyway. I think he’s a good guy but I should practice safe habits anyway. Needed this post. 
74,"I dyed my hair from the time I was 19, and vowed I would never see my natural hair color. When I turned 50, I decided to go back to natural and see what it was like. I worked with my hairdresser to transition from my old color to new using the series of lowlights and highlights. Nobody could really tell that I was growing out because there was no growth line. When I was finished, I found I have beautiful white framing pieces from crown and temple. The rest is mixed salt and pepper all over. I'm really pleased, makes me feel very much like me. Warning though, it definitely made me have to change my wardrobe a bit. Suddenly my clothes color choices from previous hair color didn't really match, and I find myself wearing a lot more pewter, blue, black and white, plus brights like fuchsia. You'll want to avoid browns and camel tones that may highlight yellow tones in your hair. Make sure you use really good shampoos and conditioners to keep your hair looking great. Also, the texture and gray hair is different than dyed hair; I find that I feel more confident if I take the time to curl it or straighten it and make sure that I'm looking more polished and not frizzy / old. A drop of argan oil is a must.

75,"He was a friend of a friend. We went on a date, and it just didn't click. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last thing I heard from him was a long rant about how immigrants were stealing his chance to get a girlfriend ""because girly like being mistreated by evil muslims, and the nice guy is forever alone"". That's when I felt like I dodged a bullet. "
76,"Just the sheer fact that we're being nice to them. Just because I'm nice to you doesn't mean I'm into you, dude. "
77,"Everything!

I remember a post in here by a guy who thought a woman had chosen a particular colour sweater to mirror the one he had worn the day before, and surely it was a sign.

There is nothing at all too small to lead someone thirsty to assume it’s a sign.

—-

I forgot my personal anecdote, so here goes:

New roommate when we were in college. The apartment housed 5 people, and this guy was new after someone dropped out and moved away.

We were all hanging out one night, and talked with him a bit, joked a bit. Nothing sexy or flirty at all.

Later one of the others told me, that he’d asked her to tell me he wasn’t into me, so I shouldn’t get my hopes up. He had claimed I was obviously flirting. 🙄 

I never wanted him, nor liked him much as a person."
78,"I used to live with someone who was one of these 'chat people'. Never anything sexual, just legit customer service. They worked for a overall chat company that serviced a number a companies - banking stuff, shopping sites, art valuation etc. One was a lady's clothing site. My friend's chat persona and name was female. I think it's kind of assigned randomly when you start, and if it's for a female - targeted company (like women's clothes or underwear) it was always a female chat name. I remember watching my mate work from home and doing sales returns on bras as 'Sandra'. 

My friend is a man. There's a very good chance this guy posting was chatting to a bald bearded dude with a female chat name. Like many people did with my friend. "
79,"I've been told that I have a happy face and smile a lot. A lot of guys seem to interpret this as a come on. I'm not sure why- people are nice to each other all the time without necessarily wanting to fuck?
If I'm really flirting with someone, they know!"
80,"Never let myself get to an unhealthy weight - fixing that now

Never cry over a boy - that'll never be fixed

Never work a job I hate - oh to be young and naive. I do have a job I like now though"
81,"I promised myself I wouldn't be broke at 30.
Lost a 60k a year job at 29
Got divorced following year
Ended up with crazy debt
Had to move I'm with parents for awhile....all by 33

But bounced back at 35 better than ever lol "
82,"He does everything almost.... Violently. Sitting on the couch and wants a bottle of water? Jumps up and practically runs to the fridge, swings it open, then slams it shut. Hasn't been talking but suddenly has something to say? He talks loudly and quickly. Sometimes, its utterly hilarious... Other times, like when I just got home from work and I'm tired, it drives me up the wall. I think its just because he's a very high-energy person and when he decides to do something, he gets it done 10 seconds ago. 

Edit: Also, the way he puts away dishes. I have to silently tell myself, ""I love him, at least he tries. I love him, at least he tries."" I repeat it over and over while putting things where they actually go. Don't get me wrong, I very much appreciate coming home to a clean kitchen... But oh boy.... The mixing bowls do not go with the pots and pans.... "
83,Ted mosby?
84,This is my favourite. 13 year old me was deathly afraid of any man who wasn't my father knowing I had bodily functions.
85,"I've had a male friend claim that the bartender was into him because she smiled and was being nice to him (i was there)...... I told him ""that's her fucking job"""
86,Treating them like a person. I've had multiple guys I didn't even want to look at think I was into them because I smile and laugh a lot naturally and they all assume I do it for them.
87,"Years ago, an acquaintance of his told him he was a good dancer. Now he thinks he's goddammed Fred Astaire. He dances like a suburban white dad after one too many on Christmas Day. He dances at every available opportunity. Sometimes I wish I could track down that acquaintance and ask him if he's happy with what he's created."
88,He likes to hold me at night with me facing him. Should be cute but I cannot breathe when my face is smushed against his chest/shoulder
89,"You know, it would help if you wore more than 15 pieces of flair..."
90,If only more stalking situations had such elegant solutions.
91,"I promised myself I'd never end up in an abusive relationship. My mom had been in one prior to marrying my father and it left her with a lot of issues. Little did I know that it's really not that easy--abusers aren't wearing a sign that announces who they are, and emotional abusers are particularly insidious."
92,*Extremely* excruciating stomach cramps for hours. 
93,"Will never again accept someone's excuse for cheating. I'm monogamous, and if you can't be, boy... bye."
94,"My husband’s feet are so weird and huge (size 13). He is so damn attractive from the top of his head to his ankles, then it just goes downhill. His toes are freakishly long, his second toe is as long as my pinky. I call them his clickity clacks, centaur boots or sloth hands. He refuses to cut his toenails short and I swear one night while we’re sleeping, he is going to slice my Achilles’ tendon. 

EDIT: just to clarify, he does cut his toe nails, just not short."
95,I promised myself to save my virginity till I get married and give him as a unique gift to him....
96,"My wife will literally not close anything. Doors, drawers, wet wipe packs, bread bag, lids on anything, as well as the things you mentioned and plenty more. 
How can I lovingly tell her that she is a demon plague on freshness/usability? I don't like stale food, dry wet wipes don't work and spilt milk is worth crying over :'("
97,"i had a friend who was constantly pre-emptively rejecting me (''i'd never date you'', ''don't fall in love with me'', ''hey, there's this girl who is not you who i really, really want to ask out...'') when all i did was be friends. smile at him? omg don't fall in love with me! ask to hang out? yeah but only as friends right frieeend right buuudddy?!

i guess he figured that because i was plain looking and overweight, i must be hopelessly waiting around for my chance with him. nah son, and in case you hadn't noticed, no one else wants to date you, either. i had to stop being friends because it was so damn annoying and he wouldn't stop it even after i gave him the smackdown."
98,"This cracks me up, I love this. My husband says ""Kanye pepper"" instead of ""cayenne pepper"" unironically and this reminds me of the same thing."
99,"We met on Tindr and he convinced me he was such a nice guy and he was so misunderstood...the typical sob story. 

He fatfished me with old photos, tried to convince me that I had autism and we would be ""an amazing autistic couple."" I finished the date - politely making conversation while waiting for my half of the cheque. 

At the end, I wouldnt let him walk me to my car. I walked him to the bus stop and waited for the bus to drive off before I left. 

When I told him later that night that we didn't really have chemistry, he begged for another chance. He told me he was really depressed and had to see me again because I helped him to feel happy. This is 110% emotional blackmail and I fell for it. 

We met again, I was really uncomfortable the entire time but he tried to insist that I was the one for him if I would just meet him closer to his place. He kept trying to grab my waist and hands despite me saying No.

I was weirded out and eventually said goodnight. He went in for a kiss, but I ducked and walked the long way home.

He threatened suicide later that night and showed me his giant scar down his arm from when he had been unsuccessful previously. 

I freaked out and blocked him. 

He messaged me on Facebook a week later telling me that he thought we had chemistry and he hadn't friended me yet because he thought it was creepy. So he waited and was messaging me as a final attempt to court me. 

It was a wild ride. 


"
100,"I had something similar happen, he locked my purse in the trunk for “safety” at the start of the date then toward the end of the date I was held hostage to him jacking off in front of me before he’d let me get my purse back.   I was 19 at the time and had no idea there could be an ulterior motive for keeping my purse (keys, mode of transportation) away from me.  "
101,"“If anxiety and depression were rational and always in response to what’s happening, it would be easy to fix and I wouldn’t have a job.” - My therapist "
102,"This happened to me. I was standing on the train staring in front of me zoning out as you do. This guy who was in my line of vision thought I must be staring at him. So he came and stood right in front of me and asked if it was okay for him to stand there. Then proceeded to hit on me and boost himself up as to why I should talk to him. I just turned up my music and ignored him. After a few stops of doing this. He got the hint. 


Also a creepier thing happened on the train while I was traveling with my son. This guy sitting in front of me was smiling at my kid and trying to talk to him. Then he whipped out his phone started taking pics. As soon as I picked up my phone to take a pic of him he ran out the train. People are fucking creeps. "
103,"Actual nice guy? I'm with him now. He's absolutely wonderful, caring, handsome, perfect, and incredible in every way imaginable. He treats everyone with respect and dignity, and he's extremely empathetic and will cry with me when we watch movies. He takes care of me and loves me with all his heart. He is a blessing, and a beautiful human being inside an out. 

Nice guy^TM? He kept disrespecting my boundaries and gaslighting me about it. He spread fake news about scoring with me or shit talked to our mutual friends how much of a ""tease"" I was. So I lost it one day, told him we had to talk, he got in my parked car and I screamed at him for 30 minutes about how disgusting I thought he was and how I never want to see him again. 
Not my best moment, but eh, it is what it is. 

Another nice guy^TM, I didn't exactly give him a chance per se. We were acquaintances but I talked with him one night at a party and we were given separate beds to crash in the same room. I guess he took those things to mean it was a green light to rape. I tried to fight him off but he was a wrestler. I eventually broke free but I  broke a drumset. 

"
104,"hahahah!!! literally saying ""I wish your standards were lower so I would look better to you."" lolol ...bro, no."
105,"I dated a guy that lived 60 miles away from me. He hardly ever came to see me and constantly complained about the long drive. He didn't want me to visit him or pick him up from the train. He could go from hours to days without contacting me, saying he was so busy with work (he worked part time at a pizza place) but he had me so convinced that he loved me and we were meant to be together. He had me wrapped around his finger. I'd believe any bullshit excuse he could come up with for why he couldn't come see me. 

This went on for two years. Yep, I'm that kind of stupid. 

Spoiler: he was seeing a girl he told me not to worry about the entire time, even living with her for most of it. They're married now.

A couple months later I started dating a guy that also lived about 60 miles away from me. (Same area, around our state capital) On our first date, he drove 60 miles to pick me up, took me 45 miles back to the capital city for an art festival, 45 miles to drive me back home. By this point it's around midnight. He held my hand while i slept in the car on the way back. He then drove 60 miles back to his house and had to be to work at 5 in the morning.

We've now been dating 2 years and have been living together for one year. He had 4 jobs when I met him and he still never complained about the drive to see me. He always answered my texts and calls. There were times he'd make the drive up and we would just go straight to sleep only for him to leave at 4 in the morning to get to work on time. We did this multiple times a week for a year before we moved in together.

I love telling this story because it's the perfect example of ""if he wants to see you, he'll see you."""
106,"Leaving his beard clippings in the sink and knowing EXACTLY what I'm about to ask when I walk into the bathroom afterwards and say, ""Hey, babe could you..."" Him: ""I'll clean up the beard hairs!""

107,"I’ve had this happen to me too, the sad part is it was a complete lie, he just wanted me to feel like I had competition. Dude, please. "
108,"Thinking of doing this on NYE this year, since it’s my least favorite holiday and I’m always alone for it. I figured it would be more fun to be alone in a fancy hotel than alone in my house! "
109,"I don’t care about my hair being gray, but I do fucking hate how the gray ones are the short, crazy ones that stick up near my part.  "
110,"A coworker and I were just talking about the tip: If you have a bad feeling or think you’re being followed, never go to the next destination (home, work, etc.). Go into a busy public place (if possible) or just elsewhere (somewhere safe, not secluded) until you think it’s safe to return home or wherever or you have someone to go there with so you’re not alone. 

I also abide by the basic skills of having my keys ready, looking around and inside my car as I approach, only unlocking the drivers side door when my car is in sight. 

And when walking in the city, don’t fidget or talk on your phone, be present, aware and alert and make sure other people know you know they are there. "
111,"I was raised catholic and grew up going to bible camp and private Lutheran school. I always assumed I’d just end up with a typical Christian guy, one that all the other girls thought that would be an ideal partner because he was god fearing and went to church every Sunday. I actually ended up with an amazing woman, who I think I fell in love with the first moment I saw her. I met her at bible camp. We were both cabin leaders, both thought we were supposed to marry men to please God, ended up falling in love and have been together for 4.5 years. She is the perfect partner — kind, patient, and so so compassionate. I am so grateful to have found someone like her instead of settling because the bible told me to do so lol"
112,Inturrupts me when I talk. He just tries to finish my thought or add a story. I stop talking and stare at him till he realizes that he inturruped me. Then he apologizes and has to force himself not to talk. 
113,Google my symptoms. Diagnosed myself with stage 4  lung cancer. Decided to die quietly at home. Eventually got dragged to an sctual Doctor had  embolisms in my heart and lungs. Lucky to survive that particular bout of idiocy!

117,"oh yes, the shy goofy nerdy type who begs for a single woman to give him a chance... and then you do, and he gets to thinking you've woken some sleeping giant casanova and he simply ~~can't limit himself anymore.

120,"Don’t you love it when guys unilaterally decide you’re dating them?

Happened to me with an internet friend I had. He was so excited to tell all his real-life buddies that he finally had a girlfriend. lol nope."
121,"thought I was gonna end up with a party girl or still single but then ended up with the shy girl in class and now we've been together for about two years and eight months. got a place together and everything.  

I didn't know she was the girl for me when I first met her due to me still being a party guy at the time. but after talking to her more I found I wanted to be with her more than the others. just couldn't stay away from her. 

it wasn't easy though. she didn't want to be with me at first because of the reputation I had gained around campus. basically her friends were telling her not to talk to the ""welcoming mat"" of the campus. 

but I finally got her to be with me, I change big time for her.  stopped partying, drugs, smoking, and cut down big time on drinking. down to once or twice a month and when I due it's only four to six beers.

she told me she doesn't really like that stuff, so i figured I liked her more than I like those things and changed myself. 

in the end this girl is way better than anything I could of imagined. "
122,"My therapist asked me what my day would look like if I decided that I liked myself. Then he challenged me to ""act as if"" and it changed everything. I realized that I would be less hard on myself, less critical of others, have more hobbies, and enjoy life. My days are much brighter."
123,He scratches his balls while he’s sleeping. I mean. I love him and I love his balls but I do not need the soundtrack of my night time loving embrace to be the noise of nails against ball sack. 
124,"We dated, he was attentive and ""not like the other guys"". He wasn't my type really, but I HAD been dating people who genuinely treated me poorly and I thought it was time I made a more mature decision and dated someone with a job, who respected me, etc. He proposed super fast. I married him. Fast forward, he slowly became the most abusive person I have ever known, demanding that I devolve into his sex slave. He was addicted to porn, weed, video games, and belived he was ""not like other guys"". He was special, according to him. He was more honest, smarter, etc than anyone in the world and I didn't appreciate him enough. I became a prisoner in my own home, he controlled all the money and my social life. I was miserable. One day he physically attacked me, basically a coercive/physical rape attempt, and I fled my home in panicked fear. He sent me a manifesto email telling me that unless I can submit 100% to his complete sexual control at all times, I was not to come home (to the house we owned together). We're divorced now. He keeps trying to get me back, he ""has changed"" and misses me. Nice guys, not even once "
125,"I’m imagining marketing campaigns where companies tell men they are all beautiful no matter their size, sorta like Dove’s “Real Beauty”"

127,"I didn't think I would end up with anyone. I thought that I was unlovable and ugly. I ended up with a smart, kind, sensitive man who loves me and thinks I'm beautiful. I'm very lucky and grateful to have fallen in love with such a special man!"

I love him, but this is the one thing that always gets under my skin. "

I wish I'd had your shiny spine and healthy self-esteem back when I was in that position.  
Makes me feel good that at least SOMEONE did though!"
133,That I would never smoke weed lol
134,"He was the “nice Christian guy” I thought might be change up from some of the fuckboys I’d been dating. 

Well, he was insecure as fuck as it turns out and constantly negged me. He was also a pathological liar. He once told me I had told him I did believe in Jesus even though I explicitly told him I was non religious when we started dating.

When I broke up with him I told him he treated me like shit and that I was a god damn catch.

When confronted about why he doesn’t at least dump the milk out and rinse the bowl, he gets a blank look on his face like he had an out of body experience and had no recollection of doing it. The most rage inducing part is that he honestly doesn’t do it on purpose and is generally a tidy guy- so I can’t even be mad!"

140,"Promised myself I'd be through grad school and employed before I even considered getting married.

144,"I went on a first date with a guy I knew via friends.  Was a pretty cool date but I got weird vibes, he was a little bit too domineering for my taste; making fun of me and being slightly pushy about where we went and what we did, like ordering my burger for me without onions (he didn’t like them I guess, but he never asked me). Made out with him anyway (why) and went home. 

He wanted to meet up the following week and I said yes. I asked if he wanted to go out for coffee and he acted pouty, said he’d expected to be invited to my house. Why? ‘Well, when I really click with someone, I like to see their home.’ 

I told him that this was a little too soon for me and I’d rather meet up somewhere and he went nuclear. Said I was stuck-up and distrustful and a prude, he was sorry for wasting his time with me, and what did I think dating was for if I didn’t want to have sex?!

I quickly cut him off (and laughed with my friends  that evening about the fact that he threw such a fit) but it made me feel really uncomfortable and weird and wasn’t really funny at all. I guess I dodged a bullet there.

I still follow him on Facebook for some reason and he’s always posting woke shit, like he’s the most enlightened scholar in the world, all of this feminist stuff. Isn’t it weird how sometimes very vocally ‘woke’ men are actually such creeps in real life? "
145,"I worked in food service &amp; my boss  did an experiment on this because his girlfriend did the same thing, soaking dishes for days so it's easier to clean.

He had 3 pans with the exact same mess on them, and he washed one right away (control pan), soaked one for 5 minutes, and left one soaking overnight.

He found that the one soaked for 5 minutes was just as easy to clean as the one that soaked overnight."
146,"Laundry takes him 4-6 hours every weekend. He monopolizes the washer/dryer from Saturday around 8 AM to Sunday evening.

It's a huge event that starts on Saturday where he does tons of small loads (each with different products, like bluing liquid for his white undershirts that no one even sees).  Sundays he then steams everything. (Not just his dress clothes, but also undershirts, casual t-shirts, and jeans. I have even seen him fucking lint-roll and steam socks). This requires a big standing steamer, a laundromat-style rolling cart with hangers, multiple laundry baskets, and a rolling hamper with different bins for whites/darks/colors/delicates. He takes up the whole living room with laundry draped on every piece of furniture while blasting Netflix. It takes so long Netflix will be like, ""Are you still there?"".

He is my soulmate and I adore him though. He values precision and has a PhD in engineering so he never does anything halfway. I wish I didn't have to experience the laundrypocalypse every weekend but I've learned to turn it into girl time and just stay away from the operation because it is frustrating to watch."

152,"This story is so bizarre when I tell people it, I feel like they don't actually believe me but here goes.

When I was cocktail waitressing in college, a group of middle age men came in, they were seated in a section that wasn't busy and they were pretty much the only table, another waitress passed them onto me because she was leaving because her section was dead. I greeted the guys, they were on their THIRD bottle grey goose, being loud and having a good time. I was chit chatting with them when they started to compliment me. They thought I was flirting with them and started getting suggestive and I just kept being polite and trying to get to my other tables, so I thanked them and started to leave, but the guy put a $100 bill on my tray for me if I showed him my bra. I said absolutely not, then he kept putting more and more hundreds on the tray while his friends were laughing and demanding more for the money until the amount was up to $1000. He said you can walk away with this money if you go to the other side of the bar and lift your shirt to show your bra and cover your face. I was so ANGRY.

I told them off, threw the money on the table and told them I was going to get the manager and they were cut off. Then the other man next to the one who tried to give the money then chided me saying that I was young and flirty, and how I was turning down a big opportunity to be this mans ""friend"" and that it could lead to more money and I'd be taken care of, and it was so insulting and rude of me to tell him no and what a lost opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him HE was rude, I was there paying my way through college, I didn't want their money or to be someone's mistress and that I was no longer going to serve them. I told my manager and she just laughed and called them jerks. That's it. All because I was trying to do my job, I apparently came off across as wanting to be a middle age man's mistress.  I was so angry, I left soon after.

156,"When my therapist pointed out that I get romantically hung up on people who have traits that I wish I had, or that I idolized for myself. E.g. they were practicing artists, or took risks to do the things that they loved and didn't care as much about other people's opinions. Realizing this was hugely liberating for me and also motivating - not only did I realize my obsessions with people were not really about them, but I also realized that I had been chasing after people who embodied my goals rather than working on my own goals myself.

160,"The reason that I tried so hard to please my mother was because I never felt any concern from her. I never got complimented if I did well, or comforted when I messed up. Therefore, I would do what she wanted in hopes she would care. 

My codependency issues stem from my not having an older, male figure in my life. 

I try to overcompensate other people’s feelings because I never thought my own mattered. When I was growing up, I was left alone a lot during the times when I was supposed to be socially developing. It turned into people pleasing because I never really knew how to communicate or how to make them like me. "

162,"I grew up in New York city, Women I didn’t know never smiled at me when I was walking around on street. i moved to a small town. Was struck by all these women suddenly smiling at me constantly and i immediately, reflexively interpreted it as flirting (though I didn’t do anything about it, just smiled,nicely back, as I was still kinda perplexed).  After a week or whatever I realized (i think anyway) that the women in the small town just felt safe enough to smile and be nice, while the women in New York were scared of initiating contact. 

I have to tell you, a place where people feel safe enough to smile is a much nicer place to live. "

Like the guy who came here to get validation that this one lady was into him just because she put lip balm on while he was around.

Makes me anxious to exist in public when people are this way. 

She adjusted her shirt, that must mean she likes me! She put lip balm on, this is a sure sign! She moved her hair out of her face, that's definitely her way of flirting with me!

173,"My biggest revelation was realizing that I put my anger and depression into my closest relationships (e.g. family, partner) because I considered them ""safe spaces"" for holding negative emotions.

174,He swallows liquids SO LOUDLY. I have misophonia so sometimes I have to leave the room. 
175,"Oh my god this has happened to me too. It's so freaking annoying. A guy I casually hooked up with told me afterwards that he didn't want a relationship and told me not to fall in love with him. I said ""ok,cool. I don't want a relationship either"", because, like I said, it was a casual hook up. The dude had the audacity to get offended when I said that. It's okay for him to reject me but it's not okay for me to reject him, apparently."
176,"Weird one. So when he gets something from the fridge that is in a ziplock baggie, he won’t squeeze the air out of the baggies when he puts it back. So our fridge will be full of puffed up baggies of sandwich meat and cheese. It drives me crazy. He also does it with the bread. "
177,"My therapist calls it ""parentified child"", and it has explained all the relationships I've had in my life, ever. I've always been overly responsible of others, even at my own expense, and I never felt supported by my mom, because I was the one supporting her. To this day she will proudly say I was more her mom than she was mine, and it makes me feel so uncomfortable. "
178,"Walk like you're running five minutes late for something. I'm a friendly looking person and being approachable is a pretty important thing for my job, but I used to live in an area where I got catcalled and harassed constantly.

179,"I promised myself I would know when a guy wasn't right for me after years of watching my sister in an abusive relationship. Turns out ""not right for you"" doesn't mean he needs to be abusive."
180,"I posted this on the main sub but I will repost it here: 

I’m a 110 pound, tiny 20 year old woman and I have pretty well perfected how to not get fucked with. Some of my rules:

- on public transport or other public areas where you worry someone will bother you, keep your eyes to yourself. Look at your phone or read a book, while still being aware of what is going on around you. I find if your eyes are wandering and you’re looking at people, some people will take it as an invitation to come talk to you or worse: some kind of insult or threat (this is when you get a “what are you looking at bitch” yelled your way)

- at night, especially if I have been drinking, I never walk within arms reach of a doorway, a parked car with someone in it, an alleyway, etc. Anywhere where someone could conceivably grab you and pull you inside is somewhere you want to stay a fair distance from when you are walking past

- Never take a drink that you haven’t seen poured. Make sure you are the one to take it from the bartender, don’t let it be passed to you. Sometimes it sucks to turn down free drinks from a guy who is more than likely a totally normal, nice guy who isn’t out to roofie you, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. 

- if you’re at a bar/ nightclub and a guy is bothering you, refusing to leave you alone, touching you without your consent or grabbing you (I once got grabbed by the neck by a man in a very busy club)- Tell security. Nightclubs want girls there, this is why you so often see “guys 5$, girls free” type deals for cover. No bar wants to get a reputation for it being a place that is dangerous for women. Security can and will kick a guy out who is being aggressive, or at the very least talk to him and agree to keep an eye on him so that you feel safe.

- if you are somewhere where pickpocketing is an issue, wear you purse crossbody, with the bag itself sitting in front of your body. Keep you hand resting on top of the bag

- take a photo of the license plate and/or taxi licence of any taxi/ Uber/ Lyft car you get it. Make it obvious that you are doing this. Send it to a trusted friend or family member. I usually will do this when texting my parents or a roommate that I am on my way home from the night- then they know to expect you, and have information about who is driving you if you don’t come home. I find that doing this also prevents being flirted with, harassed and overcharged by the driver as well- they know that you have their information and could easily use that to report them or make a complaint if they do something wrong.

- if someone is bothering you DO NOT BE NICE!!!! This is my biggest tip. This works both for people begging on the street/ trying to get you to buy something off of them (you see this a lot in bigger cities like Paris or Athens). If you tell a man on the street selling bracelets “oh those are beautiful but no thanks” then likely they will not let up with trying to get you to buy one. If you say “no thank you” and keep moving right off the bat they will likely leave you alone. If they keep pushing say that you don’t like whatever they’re selling/ think it’s ugly and they will usually give up because they see it’s not something you want. 

- not being nice also works when someone (usually men) are catcalling/ harassing you, whether on the street or at the bar. If they compliment you don’t thank them, don’t acknowledge them, just keep moving (and maybe shoot them a dirty look). If they keep following or yelling at you reply, very loudly to try and alert people around you that something is going on, something along the lines of “please get away from me”.  Keep this going until they leave you alone. Sometimes getting out your phone and starting to videotape them if they really won’t leave can stop them. Sometimes being “rude” is necessary to keep you from getting in harms way. 

- if you are ever threatened, even with a weapon, never ever go to a second location with someone. Make a scene, scream, kick, bite, pee your pants, do ANYTHING to prevent you from being taken somewhere else. Your likelihood of dying goes WAY up if you are taken somewhere else. Think of it this way: if you’re going to be murdered either way don’t you at least want your body to be somewhere more public, instead of buried in the woods somewhere, never to be found, with your friends and family never knowing what happened?

EDIT: forgot what is probably the most important tip: practice, practice, practice these!! Make them a part of your everyday life. Taking a cab to in the middle of the day with a bunch of people? Still take photos of their licence. Walking around with your boyfriend or someone who could protect you? Still stay away from doors and alleyways. 
If you make these things routine then you are still going to be doing them when you are stumbling home drunk at 5 am, or when you are exhausted after a long day of work. Having these as part of my routine has helped me never forget to take these measures, no matter what my headspace is."
181,That was almost a haiku
182,He makes farting noises almost every time you bend down or squat. 
183,"&gt; Never dating someone who mentions at every opportunity that they were “raised by women”, “raised to respect women”, etc. EVER again. I learned the hard way that saying that shit more than once is a Nice Guy™️ Specialty.

Half of me thinks that most of the people who say this are raised to respect women in a very patriarchal way and not in a way that is particularly progressive.

Edit: just FYI, I’m male. I’m saying this as someone who said that for years without realizing how I was actually raised; to “respect” women in a very conservative and patriarchal way."
184,This thread is making me feel naked.
185,One time an ex bought me earrings carved out of elephant tusks. My ears aren’t pierced and I love animals and am not ok with humans cutting off elephants tusks. 
186,"You're thinking of the 70s when all rock stars wore their pants/jeans so tight in order to have the outline of their penis proudly displayed. It was so common that  some were accused of ""padding""  

I just remembered that fad/trend while watching bohemian rhapsody. ..oh, yea. They use to do that...type moment.  

The scene at Wimbledon gives a great visual via Freddie Mercury's tight tight jeans."
187,"Walking my cat on a leash in the backyard.

She made this unearthly yowling noise while running in circles at the very end of the leash. Then she latched onto a chain-link fence and tried to climb into the neighbor’s yard. When I pulled her off of that, she latched onto my shoulder. At some point, possibly when I was pulling her off the fence, her little claw started bleeding so there’s blood on my shirt from her and I’m bleeding from her scratches and my boyfriend had to come save me.

She’s so energetic and I thought she would love to have a little romp outside. I came in and cried because she got hurt. Never again. She is an indoor bb."

I said ""Why would I ever need my mascara to be water proof.

And she said ""You never know when a boys gonna leave you crying in the rain.""

I had never even dated anyone at the time so I just laughed and told her that was silly.

Three years later GUESS WHERE I WAS. In my front yard crying in the rain as my first boyfriend drove away.

Guess who didn't have on water proof mascara.

I looked like a cult member who just got back from a seance.

I only wear water proof now."
194,"It’s so nice not to be conventionally attractive as a woman. I don’t know how you ladies do it. I am incredibly friendly, outgoing and downright flirty with customers in my jobs but I’m able to without worrying about this at all. I know 99% of guys won’t be interested if they *did* misinterpret my friendliness so it’s really nice. I call it “ugly privilege”. Ugly privilege gets me a lot of great things in life. "
195,That's a super power I'd like to have

203,"If you think that's bad, I knew a dude from India who said all US girls loved him. His reason why? He visited the US and went to a strip club and several of the strippers offered to let him pay them for private dances. In his words this was proof ""they clearly wanted me"".

My dude. That's literally what they're paid to do. They were literally asking you to pay them for the dance, just like they normally do. That's their job. "
204,Someone who repeats my own thoughts and jokes back to me as if they are their own original thoughts and jokes
205,He sounds very nice
206,Yay rich horse lady! It’s rough to be taught to be polite and nice “sugar and spice and everything nice” then be pushed out into the scary world where that behavior can get you hurt. Let’s here it for the older women who show us the ropes!
207,"I was a cashier at a little mom and pop convenience store that had an outdoor bar that opened up at night, I never worked the bar but was friends with the bartender. One night I'm hanging out at the bar after work and this customer who had been in the store earlier that day comes up to flirt with me. Being a cocky (and slightly drunk) 22/23 year old I told him that I was polite to him in the store because I had to be. But I'm not working now and I'm not going to be polite to you. 

Apparently he really liked that and followed me around the rest of the night and tried to insert himself into my friend group for a week or two before he took the hint and left me alone."
208,i kind of had the opposite realization.  my therapist made me accept that i am different because of my trauma. that people who were raised on survival see things differently than people who were raised by love. and that going through life trying to live like people who have had a sturdy foundation is recipe for disaster.  once i accepted that my life improved tenfold.  knowing that im not wrong for having a different view. for being scared of things no one else is.  for having sadness no one understands.   changed my life. 
209,"That is true and a great way to look at it.  I always found it kind of ironic:  ""I'm not really all that nice."" Followed by: ""are you ok?"", ""how are you feeling?"", ""can I do anything to help?""....or just dropping everything to come save the day for whatever minor or major tragedy had befallen me or another woman.  Some of these were self-promclaimed ""bad boys"".  And people still wonder why some of us swoon over that ""bad boy"" type.  "
210,"My boyfriend dropped everything to take care of me this week when I was having intense muscle spasms in my shoulders and neck. I thanked him yesterday and his response was “wait, for what? I didn’t do anything?”

He sees the things he does as normal and needed, which is true. Someone was going to have to get me hot packs from the store, someone needed to help me do my laundry. He’s right, honestly. In the grand scheme of things, he was just doing the right thing. 

What he doesn’t realize is most people wouldn’t give enough of a shit to do the right thing. He doesn’t comprehend how special he is."
211,"I promised I’d never have plastic surgery. 
Fucking LOL, my new titties are great "
212,"I did the same. Then when I hit puberty I knew I would never last. So then I decided I wouldn’t have sex until I was in love. That didn’t work out either. 30ish sexual partners later and I got my first boyfriend, but he ended up being impotent. 20 or so more sexual partners later and now I’m with my partner for life. Never thought I’d be a poly bisexual woman living with my poly bisexual partner who has fully emerged me into the bdsm leather scene but here we are and I’m so happy. "
213,"Unfortunately we dated for 7 years too long. I was his first girlfriend (we were in college) and he was the sweetest guy ever; not a mean bone in his body. My parents loved him, friends loved him, his family loved me, and everyone thought he was the one because how could he not be? He was so kind, polite, just an all around amazing guy - I loved him but I just never fell in love with him. 

From the day we graduated, he really dialed it up a notch and everything he did revolved around wanting  to “take care” of me. He just wanted to do *everything* for me so that I didn’t have to. He got a great job right out of college, bought a house, was making great money for the both of us and ...I don’t know. It really made me feel like I couldn’t be my own person or my own success story and that could never be if we stayed together. 


I ended up being the one to break up with him. The entire world hated me for it but I made it easy for our mutual friends and just saw my own way out of our social circles. I got a lot of “how could you do this to him?” “How could you be so cruel?” and they were right in that I should have listened to my gut earlier and ended it years ago. In everyone’s minds, there was no justifiable reason why I would do that to such a great guy. To someone so perfect. 


But in the end, I knew I wasn’t perfect for him. We went our own ways and he ended up marrying a wonderful woman, from what I’ve heard, and I married my now-husband. Today is our 1 year anniversary and we have a baby on the way, due in April. As he sleeps soundly next to me, I am so thankful that I made the decision I did. I can’t tell you how scary it is to think about what my life would have been like had I stayed. It terrifies me to think I wouldn’t have what I have now. "
214,"""hey, I noticed you were into me by the way you were existing"""
215,"Oooohhhhh that's why that happens. I've just been dealing with them. Fuck man that's a game changer, I threw up cause of them once and I havent taken them since. Thank you! "
216,"I had promised myself I'd live with my parents until I either got married or for the rest of their lives to be their caregiver. The situation with them became so toxic as I grew into an adult, though, that I took the first chance to move and ran."
217,"Sometimes, my husband will be standing and telling me a story and I literally haven't been able to concentrate on it because he's been violently YANKING at his balls since he opened his mouth. I have to stop and I unintentionally end up basically shouting, ""ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT IS GOING ON."" He always snaps, ""THEY ITCH!"""
218,"This could be a movie, what a nightmare!"
219,"Worked as a receptionist once. It was literally my job to be nice to everyone, customers and coworkers. 

Male coworker took my kindness as my interest in him. Was getting a little too close for comfort.

A different male coworker had to tell him to ease off. Clarified that I'm ""just a nice person"". "
220,"Men would be even more tediously preoccupied with penises, and how their own compares to other people's."
221,"You know now that you mention it, I wouldn't be surprised if this hot girl diddnt exist and he just wanted to show me what a 'nice guy' he is for turning her down... He seemed genuinely shocked that I was angry instead of greatful "
222,PSA: never accept a pity date. For your sake and everyone else’s.
223,Persuading myself my gut instinct was wrong about somebody. Sorry to say I did that more than once.
224,"i baked a keto cake yesterday.

225,Vanity sizing for codpieces would be even more confusing than bra sizing.  One brand's Super-XXL Magnum would be another brand's medium.
226,"It's funny because my first two tattoos I was like ""I'm getting this because the meaning of this blah"". But really deep down, it was because I liked the look of that particular image.

I have 7 tattoos (ranging in sizes). Aside from the two that are actual words I picked for their meaning, the rest are basically just things I find pretty and that I wanted to get done, heh. "
227,That is amazing. My Dad says Leonardo DiCapriCO unironically and I’m just like...twitch...
228,"My biggest revelation was realizing I had no way of letting go of emotions or no outlet. 

People easily open up to me, which I love and I enjoy having deep discussions with others. At work, as a project manager, I get a lot of complaints about projects and other people and I always try to say I hear ya and we’re trying to improve. I let them vent to me so that it doesn’t negatively impact the work environment. I don’t mind doing this and a lot of times I try to put a more positive spin on things; however when I brought this up to my therapist she asked how do you release that? I was at first confused by the question. After further explanation, I realized she meant how do you release those complaints, concerns and overall emotions you’re receiving from friends and coworkers. I didn’t really have an answer at the time. 

It was eye opening to see that one of my positive personality traits could also be negative to my emotional well-being. 

I’m still working on it, but now I use biking or simply going on a walk to let out some of the emotions. I’ve also started meditating before bed. Sometimes, I even just let myself have a good cry which helps too. 

"
229,"That's crazy talk.  Butts are for anal, and we don't pee because pee is stored in the balls."
230,"At first he was very charming and lovely to be with, but he became extremely controlling very quickly, telling me what to wear, how to do my makeup, claiming all the typical 'nice guy' things like ""You're prettier without makeup"", etc. 
This was only three weeks in and when I called it off with him he begged me to stay and claimed he was just protecting me from the fuck boys out there and started spewing shit about how girls never give 'nice guys' a chance. What ever, man. I'm outta here. "
231,"An all day date or hotel for only a 50 minute drive? Lmao.

Maybe it’s because I live way out in the country, but a 20-30 minute drive is standard to get to anywhere I want to go to. The closest mall is 45 minutes away.

How did he expect a relationship to work out with you if a less than 1 hour drive warranted an overnight stay? Yikes."
232,"Omg yes!! My bf does the same thing, I hate it but it really makes him happy so.. 😂"
233,"This is something that's been brought up about myself recently and only because my partner is soo patient. I've always done this (child, teen adult) and I thought it was an anger issue. One day, on our way to dinner with my family, I got angry and upset. I apologized a few minutes later and what he said was so enlightening. He said, that's okay. You usually get a bit anxious when we're about to see your family. Soo eye opening. He managed to identify my 'rage' as anxiety whereas I've always felt it as anger"
234,"Same here. He was the funny guy, the SIL that every mother dreams about, but behind close doors he was controlling and manipulative. If I was to go out with friends he would try to blackmail me saying I was abandoning him, and that I didn't love him. He would say those things even when I got together with colleagues to study. He tried to isolate me from my friends and family, he said that it I ever cheated he would hit me so hard no one would recognize me. When I realized what was going on I was on a toxic relationship for a year. And noped out with the help of some friends who never gave up on me. Until today he tells the story that I was the crazy girlfriend and that he was a terrible victim on the story. "
235,He puts the full garbage bag on our bed while he’s tying the top strings. What if it gets a leak? Why do that???
236,Is that a sign that she likes me? 🤔
237,Never begging for someone’s love who puts 0 effort into the relationship.
238,Wow I thought you were talking about coming out of the womb and I was thinking honestly same. 
239,"My grandma told all of her grandkids that if we turned 18 and honestly could say we had never had a cigarette or tried alcohol she would give us $1,000. I was like hell yeah, easy money. I made it til 12. Lol"
240,bruh
241,"I promised myself when I was about nine that I would never utter the words “chili cheese dog”. I just wanted there to be a sequence of words I would never ever say in my life. It also became my secret password in case I met somebody claiming to be me from the future. Something only the real me could truly know. 

Well I fucking blew it when I was 22. Ordered a chili cheese dog threw a drive through and didn’t realize what I’d done until the words were already out of my mouth. "
242,"In my experience? Anything from a being ordinarily polite (guys in a university club) to ""please leave me alone I'm trying to text  somebody"" (stranger in a bar) to literally walking through town on my own not interacting with anybody (old guy I didn't know). Some men just think they're irresistible. "
243,"Holy shit, is this really a thing? My shy-goofy-nerdy type hadn't been on a date in 4 years before I fell for him. We dated for 3 years, with him occasionally bringing up the prospect of marriage and a future together. Out of the blue (seriously, no fights or anything) he dumped me one day, and told me he'd never loved me and never will. Then he said he was going to fuck some Internet whore to show me our relationship was truly over. He tried 4 times and none of the girls went for it. Am I evil for laughing at that?"
244,"I used to get all pissed off when both my ex and my current husband would leave kitchen cabinet doors open. One day we were chatting about each other’s pet peeves, and I told him that the cabinet door thing really irked me. He started laughing, because... I was the one that kept doing it without ever realizing until he pointed it out. LOL "
245,"&gt; There are these bushes on either side hanging down into the water. As we start brushing up against them, HUGE SPIDERS start falling all over us. We were all screaming trying not to touch the sides. It was horrifying!!

I go tubing every year.  For any newbs, stay away from the sides! The biggest spiders in your area love the overhanging vegetation and prefer to land on your stomach and flip off the tube with you as you flail in terror. "

253,"I would say it's (somewhat) easier to be an ugly man. No, it's not all peaches and cream, I'm sure, but society allows men to be defined by more than just their looks, and at the same time, makes looks the most important thing for women. (I mean, when we insult men, ""ugly"" may come up, but it's not the first go-to. ""Ugly"" is often the first go-to for women, followed by jabs at her sexual history.) When women don't meet conventional standards of beauty, people legitimately get angry, like ""YOU HAD ONE JOB! ONE JOB! AND THAT WAS TO BE BEAUTIFUL FOR ME!"" I've never seen anyone get *angry* at men for having the *audacity* to not look like the hunks in the magazines. "

We were partying, and all the sudden the room went for a spin on me, and I put myself to bed because I could t walk or talk. He came into the room, and later on me and tried to win me back thru rape? I guess? I was fighting him off and it got super violent, he had me pinned up a wall by my throat screaming at me, I couldn’t get my feet under me and my hits weren’t making a dent and then the dumb mother fucker put his face right into mine to scream at me some more so I bit onto his nose and did my damndest to tear it off. He let go. I was the psycho. I’m just kind of remembering all of that now reading your story, and I’m freshly pissed off all over again. There were people there, watching what he was doing to me , watching he strangle me against the wall and yet I still got the psycho label. Hopefully he’s dead by now"

261,"When I had my first ocular migraine, I was at my desk at work in the Loop (downtown) in Chicago, and basically started tripping balls out of nowhere. My boss called my husband, who was at his grad school a couple of miles away, and my husband literally *ran* to me. He said he checked google maps and realized that traffic would make public transit take a while, and he has these gorgeous, tree-like muscular legs, as if he's descended from warriors who were designed to charge uphill swinging battle axes or something, and he got to me crazy fast. Then he bundled me into a cab and brought me to my doctor, who had been called and was waiting for me. It was the sexiest thing during one of the scariest hours of my life. And, similarly, when I later thanked him for dropping everything to run to my rescue, he was like, ""Well, yeah. Of course. You're my &lt;cheesy nickname&gt;.""

266,"Act like you mean to be wherever you are. Walk with confidence. Walk deliberately.

A couple years ago I was in my home country (Croatia) and popped over the border to BIH where some aunts and cousins live. One morning I went on a walk by the river that I had done countless times as a teenager. 

Well, things had changed. 

After I was well away from any houses, I realized a large portion of this area had been transformed into the town dump. Living in the dump was a Serbian gypsy settlement built out of garbage. Broken glass, refuse, and car parts were everywhere. Dogs tied to trees and burnt cars. The houses were mostly scrap lumber and plastic sheeting with bare mattresses inside. 

It was mostly men in this makeshift village. The scary part was one every single one stopped what they were doing and lined up on either side of the dirt trail I was following to just...stare. The various vicious looking dogs started lunging and barking on their chains.

So here I am in a floral sundress, an expensive purse, carrying my iPhone and a bottle of mineral water. My heart started hammering in my chest. 

What did I do? I deliberately stood up straight, shoulders back, and started walking *slower* than I had been. At one point in the middle of this camp, I stopped to take a drink of water and made eye contact with several men. Gave a few dirty looks in the direction of the dogs. 

As soon as I was out of sight, I picked the pace the hell up. I had to find an alternative path back to the town however, and that involved a perilous journey through a watermelon field, keeping my eyes open for poisonous snakes the entire time. Of course I was in flip flops.

My family freaked out later. That area has been a no-go for a long time with numerous violent incidents, and they assumed I had been warned already.

I’m an incredibly committed person but the person I’m dating is constantly telling me that they don’t “know if they’re ready for marriage” something I don’t ask of them. And says they feels like to get the answers they’re looking for they might need to be single again. Just to get some space. But I really do love this person and can imagine my whole life with them. Yet I don’t think they feel the same. 
It’s heart wrenching. And I’m in a constant state of anxiety over it. "

Ended up marrying a man with a daughter and she’s an incredible, intelligent, good hearted girl and I love her to bits."

8 guys later and I’m having the best sex of my life with my current SO. I would have hated to end up with any guy I was previously intimate with. They either weren’t good in bed, made me do all the work, were too big, or came too fast (I didn’t even know guys like that existed - legit 1 stroke. We had sex more than once too so idk). 

Now the thought of marrying someone I’ve never been intimate with it so scary to me."
277,"I recently told this story but it's the one and only thing I can really think of: popsicles! I had to take a type of chemo (adriamycin) which required me to keep my mouth cold for the 7-8 minutes it took to administer. I never got the stereotypical ""sick"" that I expected but I couldn't stomach to see a popsicle after the 2nd round. I stuck with plain ice after that. I'll never have another one again."
278,"I was in a relationship with a “nice guy” for nearly 5 years. 

Overtime he gradually convinced me to push everyone out of my life - family included. 

He also started doing sexual stuff to me in my sleep (I’m a deep sleeper). When I found out and told him to stop, he apologized and said he would stop. He didn’t. I started hardly ever sleeping, so as to avoid him violating me in my sleep. 

When I started applying to universities to pursue my masters degree he told me that I didn’t need to keep going to school because he loved me and was going to take care of me forever. 

He also broke my belongings when we fought.

But he was always so kind, romantic, and convincing. All of this was so gradual that it took years to see what a mess our relationship was. 

After I broke up with him he continued to send me gifts for about a year and then started sending me emails, after I moved across the country. But then he got a new girlfriend about a year ago. Haven’t heard from him since.

286,"A lot of people have given solid advice, so I'm just gonna tell a story about the time I think I avoided getting murdered by acting like a complete maniac:

I was riding the train home late after studying with a friend who lived a few stops away. There were only a handful of people in the train car with me when I got that tingly feeling you get from being watched. Lo and behold, an unremarkable-looking dude was staring at me from across the car. This happens to me semi-frequently, so I pulled my usual move where I pretend to get off at the next stop and dip into another car closer to the train operator. 

The guy doesn't follow me, so I quickly forget about him.  I get off at my stop and begin the short walk to my apartment. As I'm walking, I notice the sound of footsteps behind me. They sound odd, though, like someone who's trying not to make any noise. Now, I've lived in multiple big cities and I've experienced my fair share of weirdness, but in that moment I was hit with the biggest wave of primal fear I have ever felt in my life. I went from zero to freaked the FUCK out in an instant. 

Instinct kind of took over, and I stopped in my tracks and whipped around. It was the guy from the train. He just stared at me for a long moment, and then made to cross the street. I immediately began powerwalking towards my place. When I heard footsteps DIRECTLY behind me, I almost threw up. I was close to my building, but the way the front door was set up meant it was going to take me a few seconds to unlock it. If there was any good moment to grab me, it was going to be then.  

I made the split second decision to run out into the middle of the (empty) street and just go full crazy. I started screaming obscenities at the guy and kicking parked cars, trying to get an alarm to go off. I felt my only defense at that point was making it seem like hurting me was more trouble than it was worth. 

The guy, who was only 5 or 6 feet away from me, just stared at me with dead eyes while he pulled something out of his pocket. I wanted to run away so badly, but I knew that the second I did he'd jump me. So instead, I screamed so loud and so long that I thought I was gonna burst a fucking blood vessel. Finally, the guy cracked the creepiest smile, put whatever he was holding back in his pocket, and started fucking WHISTLING. He turned around and casually made his way back to the train station like he hadn't just watched a girl go completely batshit in the middle of the street. I watched him the whole way: going through the turnstile, waiting on the platform, and getting on the train. I didn't want to take my eyes off him for a second, and I also didn't want him to know which building I went into. 

I've had other freaky encounters, but that one is by far the scariest. I honestly think that dude wanted to kill me. 

TL;DR:  When in doubt, freak the fuck out. "

299,"That I was, in fact, autistic.  Mindblown.  99.7% of my entire life up to that point made complete sense.  All the problems with social navigation, problems with noises, problems with lights, problems with textures.  Why I always feel so enraged and overwhelmed when a loud truck drives by.  Why I meltdown in grocery stores during peak hours.  Why I notice minute details in my environment from the number of ceiling tiles to the license plates on cars with alarming vibrancy and memory.  Why I tend to lose sight of the broader narrative.  Why I have a tendency to get obsessed with topics to the detriment of food, sleep, hygiene, and bathroom breaks.  The fact that dogs are the only people I actually like.  The constant, unexplainable sense of alienation I felt from society.  Why participating in social interactions feels like a chronic, exhausting mathematical analysis and heuristics and trial and a shit ton of error.  Why I often find out several months later I offended someone deeply and they've been ruing my existence ever since.  Why people say shit I don't understand.  Why I say shit that makes total sense to me but elicits headlight stares from people.  Why I often feel I'm missing layers in every conversation; like people are drawing conclusions from a second set of information I'm not privy to.  This list continues indefinitely.

**EDIT:** I used to be in a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.  To all the people inquiring about assessment and diagnosis.  There is no objective test available with scoring manual to the public.  You should book an appointment with a clinical psychologist.  The assessment takes several hours, and typically includes a larger battery of tests.  This may include tests of cognitive ability/IQ (e.g. WAIS-IV), academic achievement (e.g. Woodcock Johnson), personality/psychopathology (e.g. MMPI-2, PAI), attention tests to rule out/in concurrent diagnoses of ADHD (e.g. Connor's), neuropsychology tests (e.g. TRAILS), and autistic tests proper (e.g. ADOS, adult tests, semi-structured interviews, childhood collateral reports).  It's very possible you have many autistic traits (""broader autism phenotype"", often runs in families), but do not experience a threshold of symptoms to qualify for a diagnosis.  The assessment process is very comprehensive and incorporates many aspects of functioning.  A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evaluates this **overall profile, rather than a single test.**  For example, the TRAILS is a test that assesses something called ""cognitive flexibility"", which is the ability to switch from one task to another.  An autistic score on this is typically lower compared to population average.  On the WAIS-IV, people with ASD tend to have a lopsided profile of abilities, commonly with deficits in processing speed and short-term memory, such as the symbol search subtest.  Just FYI for the curious.

I should also mention that there **is** an online screening tool that assesses something called the Autism Quotient (AQ).  **This is not a diagnostic tool, it is a screening tool only.**  If your score is high on this, it may be worth your while to see a Clinical Psychologist for formal diagnosis.  Literature indicates the AQ test does bear a reasonably high correlation with an ASD diagnosis, but it tends to be lacking a bit in clinical specificity."

301,When I was a tween my grandmother told me that if you take the sugar coated almonds from a Greek wedding and put them under your pillow you would dream about the person you would marry.

303,"I also have a guy who didn’t make it to a date.

We met on OKC and texted for a couple weeks - I was working a lot at the time and was trying to fit him in to my schedule. One night he calls me (which I found weird because we didn’t talk on the phone up to that point and I’m anti-social lmao) and I text him and say sorry, I’m taking care of a sick friend, what’s up?

We text back and forth and I end up saying “yeah I feel awful for getting him sick; that’s why I’m hosting and taking care of him.”  (I had had the flu the week before).

He flipped tf OUT. Called me a slut, a whore, went on for about fifteen-twenty texts accusing me of everything under the sun and saying “how could you do this when I’ve been nothing but nice to you?”

Once he wore himself out I responded something to the effect of, “it was nice getting to know you but I’m going to pass on a date. You’re reaction without asking questions is a huge red flag for me when we haven’t even met yet. Best of luck to you. And for the record, my friend is GAY, which I happily could have told you if you asked.”

I shit you not he texted me the next he texted me demanding a date. When I said “are you fucking kidding” he said “go out with me so then you can say we’ve met.”

No thanks, bud."

Anecdote: My mother and I are always told that we look very similar. We do look fairly similar. She has innocent doe eyes and looks lost in her own city. I have RBF and always walk with purpose. It's not intentional, but if interrupted, my face usually says 'why the fuck are you talking to me?' I tend not to flinch or react immediately when people suddenly approach me. My tone with strangers is definitive, and brief, while hers is friendly and open.   


Strangers talk to her all the time, and try to strike up conversations. They almost always only ever ask me for directions. She attracts creeps, I don't.

Dating someone who doesn't treat their mental health issues or doesn't have their addictions handled. Nope. Never again. Burned too many times. I'm not into it.

I didn't want to be a 'tease' or have him get mad at me (he was a friend of a friend, but I didn't know him before that evening). So I let him have sex with me.

I dated this guy for about a month. He was all red flags. Quiet, reserved and overly sweet with dark layers underneath. After the first week, I caught him going through my laptop, when I was in the shower. Then he started calling me terrible names and slapping me when we had sex, even though I said he was being too rough. I cried once, but he never got the message. Fuck that guy."

331,"For a lot of guys who aren't used to happy smiles from women, that kind of behavior stands out so much that they attribute more meaning to it than they should.

It's not that they logically think about it and come up with, ""Oh, she's smiling at me! Smiling indicates nigh-uncontrollable lust! She wants my D!"", it's more, ""Hmm, this woman is nicer/friendlier to me than other women, and I have no idea why. Does she possibly *like* me?"" Unfortunately, a lot of guys don't perform any introspection to go further than that and analyze the reality of the situation, and so they just settle on that that conclusion of ""She must be into me if she's being so friendly!""

I'm not saying their behavior or conclusions are okay, mind, I just think it's helpful to have that insight into why some people think the way they do. If you've never been flirted with before, it's hard to know what is or isn't flirting."

He was convinced she actually liked him and thought he was hilarious, and would regularly tip like 50% of his bill to her. Well hell yea, she's going to be extra nice to you. Doesn't mean she *likes* you bud. Husband doesn't work there anymore, but I sometimes wonder about his old coworker and his imaginary relationship with the Hooters waitress."

It made me realise that I am my brain and I felt like I knew exactly what to do when I felt the anxiety creep over me. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little story of the actual effects that session had: I haven't been on a freeway for years after being in an accident (little one, car spun around on an icy bridge and headlights were coming towards us but nobody got hurt!). I've always been terrified of driving but after that, I just couldn't go on the freeway without freaking out to the point where I would almost pass out and spend days ""recovering"". I felt pretty silly for the reaction but didn't feel like there was anything I could do about it. Fast forward to today: recently started taking a drivers course to get my license and today I went on the freeway. And everything was ok! My Fitbit did show that in the 5 min where I drove onto the freeway my pulse spiked to an average of 112 bpm, but I managed it just fine!"
350,"Not me, but my friend who happens to be black was often asked “where are you from?” when she had a job requiring her to deal with the public. When she answered with Detroit, she’d often the the “no, where are you from???” response.

351,"He definitely tried; sat in my section at work with his buddies for ages to force me to talk to him. Was consistently the only person at the table not being served or even looked at.

I heard a few tales about his dating exploits from common acquaintances over the years and hilarity was to be had, so I absolutely dodged a bullet there."
352,"My spouse understands who I am as a person or he wouldn't be my spouse.

But the most annoying gift I ever received was when a guy I was dating sent me a cheapy dress the day before we were scheduled to attend a Xmas party at his work. He intended that I wear it.

I don't know where he got the idea - maybe in some rom com where the debonair bajillionaire  sends his date a gorgeous designer dress perfectly in her size before a black tie gala?

Well, IRL its super paternalistic and patronizing. Also, it was made of some cheap stretchy polyester jersey material that was super clingy and had no structure at all. It was also too small and way too revealing. I wore a lovely cocktail dress that I was already planning to wear and dumped him at the end of the night after the party was over.

I swear rom coms are just full of absolutely terrible ideas that should not be translated or attempted IRL."
353,"The most recent one was a few weeks ago when I started going to a new therapist after feeling really anxious and frustrated and stuck in life. A lot of my concerns were around my money issues and that I felt like I was going nowhere in life and 30 is quickly approaching (I still live at home but would like to move out with my partner but felt like I couldn't do it). 

So I tell my therapist I want to pay off my debt before I move out (all credit, about $5000) and I don't want to be stuck with this debt forever and she says to me ""yes you do, because you are living with it."" And then she proceeds to tell me that it's okay to have some debt and live on my own, lots of people do it and that my family will be fine on their own if I leave them. It was like she had read my mind. 

Basically, in the span of about five minutes she pointed out to me that my debt isn't really that bad and if I wanted to pay it off I could but I don't because it allows me to stay stuck where I am which part of me likes because I'm scared to move forward in life and leave behind my family. 

And now my partner and I are moving out in two months. Found an affordable place last week. So, you know, a pretty big moment really."

355,"Buying a live Christmas tree. 

My husband and I are newly married, in our new house, decide to get a Live Christmas tree as we have only had fake ones.

Cue us buying the saddest, lumpiest patchiest tree in the Marsh parking lot. We decorated her in purple and pink lights, stuck a bunch of weird Adventure Time and Nightmare Before Christmas ornaments, and wired a plastic seahorse to the top as the ""star"", because we didn't have one, nor find one that we liked. We lovingly named her Lumpy Space Princess due to her awkward and curvy shape. 

We also didn't ever water her, as again- we had NEVER had a live tree. 

When it came around in mid January that we had to get her giant ass out of our Living room, my husband, in his infinite wisdom, made a decision, that I would not endorse NOW or EVER, and dragged her dry, lumpy, tree-ass through not one, not *two,* BUT three doorways, and sent pine needles, dried to *knife-sharp* points- EVERYWHERE.  

They were in my washer, the closed doorway of the dryer, stuck in the carpets and in the clothes, under our bed that the tree was NOWHERE NEAR- just piles and piles of needles ALL OVER.

We clogged one hose of a shopvac and the tank of another, and to this day, I am still vaccuuming up pine needles from LSP. 

Ya'll, I laughed till I cried, and with every laugh, my husband got madder and madder, but it was just so ridiculous I couldn't stop. I am HOWLING and it was just insane how big of a mess it was. 

So yeah- fake trees for LIFE.

I like giving head so I offered that, and he said he can't cum from that.. I said let's just cuddle and sleep or play above the belt (he had my shirt up) He got really pissed and told me I had to get out . Whole thing lasted about 40 minutes.

360,"I married my college girlfriend’s little sister 4 months ago. Never in a million years thought that would happen but we’ve been together 4 awesome years together now.

Edit: ok ok I’ll give the rest of the story! 

My Ex and me were together 3.5 years and her youngest sister (of 3) moved in with us to go to college in our town. Her and her sister definitely were not the closest but we all got along just fine for the most part. Now my ex’s little sister moving in probably didn’t come st the best time as we were having some issues figuring out our lives after college. Soon after she moved in I had a knee surgery that left me stuck at home for about 6 weeks while the little sister was also stuck at the house (new town no new friends). We just got along really well and would have a blast doing just about anything and it started to really piss off my ex. In retrospect I would have went out of my way more to work on my relationship with my ex as I can now see the signs and issues that led to our eventual breakup and don’t feel it was inevitable. But regardless the sister strife started to get bad as my ex started to resent her sister for our relationship issues and culminated in them getting in a sister fist fight over some spilt milk and my ex had to spend the night in jail (some real jerry springer shit). Well after that they’re relationship was brutal and with me caught in the middle due to living with them. Eventually their issues were bleeding into our issues and I was having a ton of fun with the sister and none with my girlfriend we couldn’t connect anymore and I told her we should split up and she needed the kind of guy I wouldn’t be. She was a barista and was all into the soy coffee hipster type and wanted to be like all her new coffee friends while I busted my ass in construction trying to get us moving forward. 

Anywhoo the straw that finally broke the camels back was just an Octoberfest weekend where I took the sister out riding (we both enjoyed dirt bikes and she was having me teach her) and we had a blast. Then I took my girlfriend out to a fair and we had a great time. It broke my heart because all of a sudden I felt like I was cheating on her with her sister. That’s something I would never do and really drove home how screwed up things had got and how this dynamic was not fair and I should leave. while my girlfriend was in the bedroom crying to her dad about something between her and her sister induced stress I turned to her and told her I think I have feelings for her and that I need to break up with her sister and leave them be. Maybe I shouldn’t have told her but it was a tremendous relief just to accept it and that it was a relationship killing realization. 

Well the breakup was brutal and I tried to fix things by moving us all out of the apartment and then trying to fix things which the sisters separate so I could work on my relationship. Well my ex was really brutal about things and hurt me a bunch and hurt her sister a bunch (emotionally not physically). She made her sister an outcast with their whole mutual social group and the coffee house they both work at. She blamed her sister for everything wrong in her life and was being very two faced and manipulative with me. I packed and moved all her stuff while she was fucking the coffee house or she would be at a bar while I’m waiting with a bottle of champagne and an evening planned to move things forward. 

Well after the  breakup and our mutual treatment by my now very ex girlfriend we decided to start hanging out again. We just got tired of trying to do the right thing for someone who clearly didn’t care about us. She told me she felt the same way and we fell in love. Now I was in a pickle and new this was the worst thing I could do for multiple reasons. So we drove 2 hours to her parents one weekend and told them our feelings and that we were committed to seeing this through. They were not particularly surprised as we were obviously like two peas in a pod and were very close friends while I was dating my ex. They were accepting but we all knew it would be a problem/process for the rest of the family to accept it. It was/is a process and while we have all gone to Disney land and had family functions together the two sisters do not talk (yet). The middle sister was in our wedding so that relationship is fine. But my ex still blames her/us despite her marrying the man of her dreams who is basically the guy she was trying to turn me into.

This is definitely the short version it’s been a brutal hill but we’re finally out of the woods and the family accepts us and has normalized for the most part.

If you have an iphone and are in a situation where calling 911 may further agitate the suspect there is a simple way to call for help without alerting anyone. Simply tap the lock button 5 times in succession and it will call, record, and notify any contacts you designate of your location. 

Do be aware, by default this option will make sound. Go into your settings under Emergency SOS to shut it off. Hope this saves a life one day! 

Edit: thanks for the love ladies and even guys too. I wanted to add there is an option like this on Samsung too although I am less familiar with it. Make sure to go into your settings to turn it on."

364,"At first I was sympathetic that he hadn't really made any friends before we dated (starting at the end of our junior years of high school) and believed him when he talked about how ""people always bullied him wherever he went"" and ""no one wanted to make friends with him.""  He also loved the idea of dating someone who was going to be a counselor because he thougth it was an admirable job.

Turns out he just wanted someone to be more of a therapist than a partner to him, and he would get upset if I didn't walk on eggshells around him.  Later on he also started blaming me for not wanting to have sex with him every day.  I was getting FREQUENT urinary tract infections (multiple a month at one point) and was physically unable to, but that was an excuse to him.  He considered masturbating almost as reprehensible as cheating on him, so when I wouldn't be in the mood (every day) it would be my fault for masturbating (whether I had or not) and got to a point where I would just agree to get it over with and get him to leave me alone.  He had a lot of weird ideas about sex and how it could only be missionary with very little foreplay or aftercare, so sex became this uncomfortable 2 minute daily dissociation that I got through for awhile because I thought that's what I had to do for someone to love me.

I've since found a partner who values me and takes care of me back when I take care of him (although lately he's been doing much more to support me).  He is a gift that I am constantly grateful for."

Not everyone needs commitment. But if you do, don’t be afraid of demanding it for yourself. And if they’re not willing to give it, find someone who will. You can’t change a noncommittal person into a committed one, if they don’t want that.

I’m in a relationship now with someone who sticks with me no matter what, and is very clear about their devotion to me. That’s not for everyone, but it’s what I need. And I feel much better now.

381,"My dad lived in another state, but had a cottage about an hour from my home. He didn't visit for the last few years of his life, so I ""looked after it"" (lived rent free) From time to time. After I married, sometimes I would ""get a call from a neighbor""(walk out of the bathroom looking at my phone with a worried expression after receiving no calls), and would need to drive up to ""check things out"".(watch the sunset) Sometimes the ""fuses""(refrigerator) would ""give me trouble""(be left stocked with beer). I would stay the night because I ""needed to make sure the furnace stayed lit.""(needed to remind my children that I'm married to their father, he lives in the same house as them, and can actually get them a glass of milk just as easily).

Had to sell the place last fall. Very sad. Good news is that my aunt owns the place next to it.

But no, he'd typed a message that was like ""i think ur cute. can i have ur number?"" My reaction to that was yelling ""No!"" and throwing the phone back at him, then getting off since fortunately it was just before my stop.

Another time I was just standing at the bus stop and this guy came up to me and started trying to make small talk. I responded because I didn't want to get stabbed or something, but kept it super terse, until he started asking weirdly invasive questions and I told him I didn't want to answer, then he kept asking so I just ignored him. He apologized for bothering me, walked away, then came back over and was like, ""Sorry, but I really need to know where you're from."" When I still ignored him, he apologized like five more times for bothering me and finally left me alone. The sigh of relief I breathed when he got off the bus before my stop...

One last anecdote: a guy who was at least my dad's age tried making small talk on the platform with me, then followed me onto the train and sat next to me and wouldn't stop talking to me, even when I put headphones in.

I don't remember all of it. I came back to consciousness feeling the bedroom door banging against my back (he was trying to get in, I have NO clue how I held that door shut), my daughter laying on the bed screaming, blood everywhere and my broken cell phone in my hand on the phone with 911.

But I often would get guys who are mad that I turned them down, because I was supposedly flirting or leading them on.

For example, one time, we were supposed to meet up after one of his classes ended, and I wandered off because I got a migraine, which comes with confusion for me.

The first thing out of his mouth when he finally finds me? ""Where were you? What were you doing? You were talking with another guy, weren't you? Were you cheating on me with another guy?"" Meanwhile, I am confused, in a lot of pain, and not even sure what he's even talking about..."
406,My ex used to do this and it would be fine except that he was the more picky one and actually did care where we went. I would make several suggestions and he would shoot each one down. I would eventually get so annoyed that I'd say fuck it lets just go down the street to BK so you can get your disgusting 2 for $5 deal again. 
407,When my ex boyfriend told me that he didn't believe in therapy and HATED that I went there. He told me it was only bringing bad for him and he was right because I made the decision to leave him and now have the most loving SO who's so very understanding of me.

409,"One night stand. 

I’ve done it a few times and I’m not ashamed or anything like that. It’s just BAD every time. Like the guy doesn’t care about making me feel good or anything, it’s like they’re using my vagina as a masturbation tool. The last time I’m pretty sure the only part of my body he touched was the inside of my vagina. Like not even any nipple or clit action. Over it. "

He does my laundry as well and even irons my underwear. Got to say: there is a method to the madness. Freshly pressed underwear are great. But yeah I just hang out in another room entirely when it goes on. 

Btw my husband wanted to share some tips with your SO: 

Please don’t use lint rollers, as they’re bad for fabrics - especially mohair and wool. Invest in a double-sided clothing brush instead, Kent makes a great one for around $75. You can use the coarser side for anything 180 wool and up, the softer side is great for cashmere and general maintenance.

At one point the relationship went sour and he didn't really care for me anymore or wanted to spend time with me. When I confronted him about that he said I'd been warned because I knew all along that he's an asshole. Yup. "

It's such a small thing, but even watching him get coffee is so lovely when I get to observe those micro interactions. People have opened restaurants just to make him meals when he was just walking by, not even looking for a meal aha. He impacts people so deeply in the smallest jnteractions.

It made me question my motives for a lot of behaviors. Was I being 'nice' for ulterior motives? Should I ignore them? I did a lot of cringey stuff.

I think the core of my problems were an unhealthy detachment from my emotions. Bad feelings were framed as wrong feelings. Of course this meant I was bad and wrong.

I see some of these things in the incel culture. Sadly I'm ill-equipped to do much more than comment on it."
435,"OMG. I learned my lesson on this. Dumb ass showed up at my door 2 weeks later crying and begging for another chance after the worst date EVER.

Worst of all, he was like 32 and I was 18. I shouldn't have been more emotionally mature than him?! "

443,"Not OP but as someone with a similar situation I think I can answer: 

For me it was all of the less flashy values like he doesn’t break his word - ever without huge cause. Background he works nights and came over to my apartment at 6am for our 3rd date to snuggle and after a couple hours he was weaving on his feet but dammit he promised to take me to breakfast. 

He’s really close with his family - this is more of a bonus but his mom called me the other night just to chat. That’s not something I’d ever thought I’d have. 

He’s a much nicer/kinder person than I am - and most people. He genuinely wants to help people and is perhaps a little too good spirited to the point of getting taken advantage of. 

We’re equals - it’s not a contest of who is right or who’s the best. We recognize that we have different strengths and it’s not a constant power struggle for top dog. "

Omgsh, when I was a cocktail waitress, there was a guy who was in my college class who found out the bar I worked at and would come in and order something like a pop or lemonade and stay there for hours so I'd talk to him and then tip like $20 bucks and when he was talking to a mutual friend saying I was nice but not initiating they tried to say I was leading him on for the tips! Excuse me? You stalked me at my job, continuously sat in my section, continuously tell him that it wasn't necessary/appropriate to bring me gifts and tip me that much and I showed you as little attention as possible. I even would try to pass him onto other waitresses. But right. My fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

He stopped when he had a mental break down and then I didn't hear from him for 4 years until he found me on facebook again and started messaging me. Fun stuff. "

All we did really was hang out at his house and watch southpark - back when it was cool. He would talk about how women weren't interested in him which was weird because HELLO, dating you here. We were each other's first and I wanted to do more than watch him play WoW and us watch southpark. He wasn't interested until I was going to break up with him.

The worst part is the skunk strip the first 6 months so I wore a lot of wide headbands, pulled back hair and that mascara brush on dye stuff to break up that stripe. Once it got past that it started to be more fun. Used to be called Cruella and Elvira, even to my face (yeah it hurt a bit), but now I’m SO happy not getting disappointed only 2-3 weeks after dying to see that gray creeping back. I’m still multi colored but the grey really pops now and I’m excited to see it grow longer.

The other was so preoccupied with his exes, how they mistreated him etc, would ignore me when it suited him, neglected me, pined for other women who he thought were attractive to other men and would rutinelly put everything else before me. Then he dumped me out of the blue. Took me a while to realise he was doing all these things.

I have learned to NEVER believe it when people tell me how nice someone is, because it is usually bullcrap. All my exes made problems for themselves, most of them were mistreating their women who in turn mistreated them in return and then felt like a victim. It is so hard to find a decent partner where I live, one who means what they say. 

Just take what others say at face value at all times. Just because somebody is a good friend, does NOT mean they are a good partner. Usually I have found they suck."

I can still love them but recognize that my mom was so concerned that I present myself as the perfect child that it actively killed any spontaneity I might have had then, or now. I have worked for months in therapy to shut off this endless dialogue in my head of being unworthy of compliments or love or success or even human decency because I know that I am far from perfect. I am finally starting to use affirmations and not feel completely stupid doing it."
487,Had a 3-way with a guy I was seeing in college and some random girl. I was a little tipsy but the two of them were very very drunk.

494,"At 18/19 I dated a guy several years older than me. He loved to bring up how he was older than me and he managed to get through freshman year without gaining weight while I was clearly not doing the same. (Mind you he should’ve been in a size Large t shirt but squeezed himself into Medium like an overstuffed sausage... I digress...) He was in a fraternity but very obviously they didn’t really want him there. 
Some things that should’ve made me leave but didn’t:
Me saying no and him continuing to rape me because he loved me. 
Him constantly criticizing my weight. 
Him NOT WASHING HIS HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM AND ARGUING WITH ME ABOUT IT.
The fact he was constantly lamenting about some Asian girl he once dated who got married right after they broke up. (Funny thing is I also married my next boyfriend) 
But the reason why I’m sharing this story here is he lived with his mother and stepfather who he treated like absolute shit despite living in their home. I left college for ~reasons~ after freshman year and he wanted to move to my hometown. So I found him a place to live with a friend of mine. I paid his rent until he found a job. I looked for jobs for him. Let him borrow my computer. Drove him to interviews. I wanna day this went on for 2 months when finally I just had enough and realized despite all he said and the big macho act about how he needs to be the “man of the house” what he really wanted was a mommy. He was enjoying being taken care of and not having to work and didn’t want it to change. I asked him about it and surprisingly he was honest. Broke up right there and then. "

498,"I met my husband when we were 13.  Until then, I never really thought about relationships or dating, I had crushes on guys, but I never pursued a relationship because it wasn't that important. The moment I saw him walk into homeroom on the first day of school, I had a feeling he was the one. The more I got to know him, the more I liked him- he was kind, funny, smart, treated everyone with respect- basically he seemed so mature and level headed compared to the other boys I knew. That's when I realized he was exactly the person I knew I wanted to eventually marry. 

At 15, we found out we were pregnant with our oldest and he didn't run away, he held me and told me everything was okay. He was amazing during the pregnancy, and was a great dad from the second he held her. He even worked 7 days a week while going to school until we graduated. Then joined the Marines to provide for us, and 15 years and 3 (soon to be 4) kids later, I still look at him and can't believe I married the man of my dreams. "
499,"I have a story like this too. My mom and her coworker decided that their awesome single kids should go on a date. He picked me up in a sports car that drove stick-shift and then proceeded to drive like over 100 mph on side streets whilst jerking to a stop at every light. It was a blind date, I assumed dinner would be involved, it wasn’t. He drove me to his place and said he planned on baking cookies. Which he had basically pre made cookie dough from the store. He then tried to corner me into his room by giving me tour of his place and he actually picked me up and threw me on the bed. He was really tall and overpowered me. Next he tried to make moves on me rather aggressively until I asked him to take me home. (Sadly no Uber back then) he then drove like a terrorist speed racer all the way back.
When I got home I was having quite the panic attack. From then on I always drove myself so I wouldn’t get trapped again!"
500,"I do this too, and I don’t mean it to be an interruption. I think it’s my way of trying to say, “yeah, I’m paying attention, I’m following your line of thought.”

We’ve come to an agreement that I will try really hard not to do it, but when I slip up he will nicely remind me and try not to get irritated. "
501,"I was so relieved when I learned that other people also deal with intrusive thoughts, and that the French even have a term for it: l'appel du vide, or the call of the void "
502,"Even my husband, who is an empathetic person and understands people (including women) really well, takes the smallest things as signs. For example, when we’re cuddling and I move my hair off my neck, for ages he thought that meant I wanted him to kiss my neck. No, honey, I just don’t like the feeling of hair on my neck!"

504,"My brother was in a nearby city once (where I live, cities all mesh together so it might as well have been in my city) and he ended up being given a nicer hotel by the event he was working, so he had a hotel room that he wasn't using. I took it and slept there. It was just one night and I just watched TV and went to sleep, but it was lovely. I've lived with my SO for five years and when I'm not sleeping here, I'm visiting my parents in my hometown and staying at their house. Even when my SO is out of town, the apartment is still ""lived-in."" It was nice to be in a place that felt brand new and quiet and like it was just mine."
505,"Yes. After I broke up with my fiance, our mutual friend and former roommate asked me out and said that he'd ""been waiting years to eat the fuck out of my ass"". Needless to say my opinion of him fell drastically that day. "
506,"It's one of the things that's kinda sad because dick size is something it's absolutely acceptable to make public fun of. It isn't considered harmful or shaming by society at large, just funny.  When really guys who are particularly small probably feel pretty insecure about it. "
507,"No it looked like he was trying to take a selfie at first or look at his phone. But I heard his camera go off more than once. That's when I grabbed my phone and texted my husband under the stroller telling him what was happening and asking wtf should I do because i don't want this guy following me or starting a scene or anything like that. My husband suggested to take a pic of him and go to the cops in the train station. So as I picked up my phone to to just that, the train stopped and the guy jumped off the train. It was so creepy and strange. "
508,"I just never dyed, except temporary dye for costumes or something.

511,"He sounds like a bit of a pretentious wanker to be honest. I don't blame 18yo you for being impressed though, you were at an age where pretentious wank seems really deep and meaningful."
512,"It is totally terrifying. It was so hard for him and while no one wants to believe this, it was just as bad for me. I knew there was a woman out there that wanted everything he had to offer. That was dying for their Prince Charming. I knew he would be just fine. 


Me? Well “what Id done” ruined all my friendships, my own family was pissed, and all I had was two best friends: my dog and my human best friend who (while totally blown away at the situation) took me to ice cream and at least genuinely tried to figure out what the fuck was going on in my head. I knew my whole world was going to come crashing down but a proposal from him was inevitable and there would be a possibility that I wouldn’t have the strength to say no in that moment. So I had to get away. 

I literally still have nightmares about it, as recent as just a few weeks ago. I have this dream where I’m getting ready for my wedding all over again and that I’m on my way to the venue. As we arrive, everyone starts talking about how my old boyfriend is lighting up, he can’t wait to see me, everyone is over the moon and immediately, I start to panic. My current husband in this dream doesn’t exist as someone I know but as a figment of the happiness that I know I won’t have if I marry my ex. In my mind, I start absolutely losing it and saying no, he’s not the one, why am I here, I swear that there’s someone else that I’m supposed to marry, is this it for me? Then I just accept my fate and try to tell myself that it won’t be so bad, he’s a great person, and I’ll be taken care of. But at the same time, I feel like someone just killed my soul. And then I wake up completely out of sorts and feel an overwhelming sense of relief that there IS someone else, and he is better for me and that‘s my husband who’s asleep right there. 


I’ve never told anyone about that because I know they’ll say “even your dream is self centered” and not even there can I think about someone else’s feelings but...I knew my ex would end up happy. It was me that I really wasn’t sure about. "
513,"Don't you know you should be grateful he wanted to use his godly penis on you?

What a beautiful haiku.


I am done now, thanks!
"
515,"Oh yeah this happened to me as well.

I was a shy 19 year old freshman in college when an older student starts chatting with me while I’m having lunch.  I’m confused and let him talk because I’m young and naive. He starts asking all kinds of questions and if I go to “clubs” I say no I’m new and not 21. Then he says well we could go somewhere where it’s all ages. Again confused I say no I’m okay but thanks. For the next month or so he happens to bumped into me on my way to classes or while I’m trying to study. I switch my studying time and location but still randomly bumped into him.  One day he tries to hold my hand but I give him and awkward hive five and then after a classmate commented on how sweet my boyfriend is for walking me to all my classes. I realized what was happening or what he was doing. 

Next time I saw him I mentioned I was getting back together with my ex and that ended that fake relationship. Never was bothered by him again!"

523,"Sleep with multiple coworkers/supervisors within the same job (only 3). We all know for the most part, humans can’t keep their mouths shut, so once it got out I slept with X, Y and Z at my job I had throughout college, i was gossiped about so much and called the “UPS slut” behind closed doors. To make matters slightly worse, the men i slept with were all supervisors, so you know they thought i only did it to advance in the job. My good friend who worked with me (didn’t sleep with him haha) showed me a group chat with the guys in our work section and showed all the hateful things said about me and one coworker even threatened to rape me if he made a move on me and I rejected him.

I didn’t quit , but after my friend showed me those messages, I stopped talking to virtually everyone at my job except him and I cut ties with the three I had relations with. I had to move my work area and everything.
Let this be a lesson, don’t sleep with people at your job (unless you are dating them), even if it is just a one night thing. Two of them were a one time thing, but one It was a mutual FWB. 
I am responsible for my actions and I’m not playing the victim at all, I was mostly disappointed at my one coworkers who said he’d rape me if I reject his advances.
Also, I did report him and he got fired. "

531,"Sometimes you can be too proactive/can't fix things, and that I'm an introverted extrovert who needs down time. I always try to fix all my own issues and power through them.

I had an unexpected breakup with my SO of 4 years this year at 29. I've been struggling. My friends haven't been supportive. To be fair, they haven't been single single at least 21, and they're planning weddings or expecting baby #1 or #2. All conversations are wedding/baby related. I just internalized my stuff, kept busy,  and supported them.

I ran my first marathon, volunteered more, launched a new career, applied to be a CASA, made plans to start a graduate degree, listened to friends' wedding/pregnancy woes, attended baby showers, became head ""bridesmaid wrangler"" at the request of friends - saying yes to all things but dating. I felt fulfilled, but exhausted, uncomfortable in my own skin, and still very shitty.

My therapist asked why I keep saying yes. I told her enjoy helping people, but also people say to focus on yourself and stay busy after a breakup, right?  She told me I'm used to being a fixer, but this isn't fixable. That long term relationships mean long term feelings. She asked what would happen if I dialed back my involvement with things and focused on getting comfortable in an uncomfortable space. I can't distract myself from this or it'll inhibit growth later on, I need to feel sad for a bit, and that's okay. And it's okay to find some new friends.

I still feel like shit almost 6 months out, but it's a process. At least I know when to say no!"

541,"It's a difficult thing, because the entire problem is that the parent lacks emotional maturity. So if they were the sort of person who could accept this kind of feedback and move forward, they wouldn't be the sort of person who needed this particular confrontation. Doing something like this _seems_ like it might resolve the issue in the long-term -- and it probably would with a lot of people -- but a very likely outcome with an emotionally-incestuous parent is a lot of defensiveness, followed by unpleasantness (possibly lashing out, but maybe self-berating, etc.) that requires reassurance and soothing. 

In other words: Doing this just puts more work on the child, because  this is a type of teaching moment, and the work of cleaning up the emotional aftermath from the discomfort it creates will also fall on the child. 

If the parent is in therapy themselves, or is at a point where they've expressed a willingness to change the nature of the relationship, it might be worth doing - otherwise, it's not an effective strategy for resolving these types of unhealthy dynamics. "
542,"I pretty much follow the ""hood rules"" I grew up with.

Keep your eyes to yourself. Don't stare at anyone.

Be observant. Pay attention to your surroundings.

Make sure someone always knows where you are or where you're going. 

Don't start nothing, won't be nothing. 

And finally 

Trust nobody. 

If all that fails, defend yourself. Carry some sort of weapon or know how to turn your surroundings into weapons. "

568,"This sounds morbid but is advice that my police officer father told me when I was young.


If you ever are in a situation where someone is trying to kidnap you/take you by force someplace/carjack you, fight for your life there and then BEFORE you get taken to the second location, etc. 

The second location is almost always where they are going to bring you to kill you. 

Better to fight immediately and have a chance for survival. 

Edit: for clarification "
569,He eats so fast. Nothing like going out to eat and having your husband watch you eat because he inhaled his meal. I often ask him if he even tastes his food. 
570,"Wow, this hits home. My husband is bitter, angry, depressed, anxious person at home, but charming and outgoing and fun around everyone else. He says it's because he can ""be himself"" and ""relax"" around me. The worst part is that because he's so 'up' around everyone else, no one believes me except my own siblings. I'd be so much happier with him out of my life, but he has health issues that make it unsafe for him to live alone and I guess I feel like I'd be a jerk to leave. 

Edit: The things you've all said are things I already know, things I intellectually and emotionally understand, have understood for a long time. It's fear of the negative consequences my actions might bring about that holds me back. Add a raft of guilt and the bone-deep conviction that I have to be 'good' and take care of people, and dread of  the mountain of shit I know I'll have to climb before I get to the other side. But you are all right - being cowardly is only adding to my burden, and I need to act before stress and misery literally kill me. Thank you all for your insight, encouragement and kind words."

11 years old. First week of middle school. Wearing tight white shorts. 

I was doing push-ups in gym when I noticed I felt weird. I looked down and saw blood everywhere. I knew what a period was but I was not prepared. 

I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. Of course he gave me a huge attitude and made me walk to the far side of the gym in front of the whole class. I kept my legs squeezed together and prayed no one saw. The whole time he berated me and said I just wanted to get out of doing push ups

In the bathroom I was panicked there was blood everywhere. After ten mins he sent a girl in after me. She brought me to the nurse and they called my mom to bring me a change of clothes. 

As we were waiting the fire alarm went off so the nurse gave me a jacket to wear around my shorts as we went outside. It was also raining outside
