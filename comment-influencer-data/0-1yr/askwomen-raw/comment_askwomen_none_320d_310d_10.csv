0,"She asked, and thus ended up being one of the first people I told I was pregnant. I couldn’t even go to the wedding—I lived 500 miles away and on the wedding day I was 8 months pregnant on no-travel orders. Baby was born 2 weeks later. 

Bride was excited, not angry.

Over a decade later I am still sad I missed that wedding though—so many of our friends and families have not all been together since."
1,"I was a broke college student that had my own bills to pay on a student worker part time wage. She expected me to buy my own dress, and the one she picked out was $400 and refused to change to a cheaper one. I literally made $400 per month so there was no way I could afford it. She got mad and has not talked to me since, which does not bother me because she was being extremely selfish."

3,"it was one of the many ''dating but not dating'' things my best friend and i did while we were in love with each other but didn't think the other returned the feelings.

so spoiler: if you make deals like this, you're into each other. don't wait to be each others' backup option or be cast aside when they do find someone, make it happen actively."
4,"I can’t think of many as an adult if I’m honest, but I always remember an incident when I was around 11.

I was picked to go on this summer camp type trip for a week with a bunch of kids in the year above me (12/13 year olds) because of good behaviour. I was the only 11 year old. There was a boy I’d had a crush on for a while and on the first day he asked me to be his girlfriend. Obviously we were all children so that doesn’t even mean anything! But he kept it going for the whole week, sending me notes, hugging me in the hall before we were sent to separate dorms etc. 

On our last night I got a note asking me to meet him in the hall, when I went out the entire group was there (35-40 kids) all crying with laughter. He announced to everyone it had been an entire joke that the whole group had all been in on and he’d never be interested in an ugly teacher’s pet.

As an adult, I’m obviously not remotely upset about the “romantic” rejection because I was 11 ha, but the social rejection and the public humiliation aspect of it was tough. 

Anyway I’m 24 now and he slid into my DMs after high school and I told him to go fuck himself, which felt good. "
5,"My sister asked me to be her Maid of Honor and i declined. She was like ""What the heck, why?!""  I told her ""Youre just asking me to be nice and because you think its the right thing to do. But I'm not your best friend. Jocelyn is your best friend,  and she should be your maid of honor."" My sister cried and said what a good sister i was. So i guess i demoted myself to bridesmaid. "
6,"This happened in sixth grade. I was bullied badly throughout elementary school. For reasons I still don’t understand, I was made a social outcast by the mean girls. I was walking home from school with one of the cool boys in class, who was always nice to me one on one, but eagerly joined in the bullying otherwise. He told me that one of the girls in class was having a party after school and that I should come. I was so excited to be invited to a party with the cool kids. I went home, told my mom, and rode my bike to the girl’s house. I rang the doorbell, and the whole group answered. One of them said “oh my god she actually came”, and they all laughed. Then the girl whose house it was said “you can go now”, and shut the door in my face. I was too ashamed to go back home and tell my mom what happened, so I rode my bike around aimlessly crying for a couple hours before going home. 
I am 35 years old now and that memory still stings. I am so grateful that I had a loving home life, and social media wasn’t around yet. I don’t know if I would have made it through otherwise. Don’t be bullies kids. "
7,"Fresh tampon before the event starts so I dont have to even think about it. Everyone wants to pee last minute before the event anyway so it's not too bad or out of place to use the bathroom. 

I was also a mutant and liked having my periods on race days (XC runner) because for some reason I was absolutely wired. Every best race I've had was when I was on my period. I called it my hormonal rage. "
8,"My friend and I made a deal that by 30, if we are not married or in any type of relationship, we would get married. This was when I was 18 and he was 21. Well, we ended up dating when I was 23 and we got married a few weeks ago. He turned 30 this year. I think we kept our promise!"
9,I made a deal with a co-worker that if we still worked the same job in five years we would kill each other. Luckily we found better employment  and the whole killing each other was said in jest. I think...
10,"Yes, I was asked to be the maid of honor at my best friend’s destination wedding. At the time she asked me I was 20 weeks pregnant with my second child, very much showing, and my job was ending (contract job). My husband and I had just made the decision that rather than trying to find a new job when I looked so pregnant, we would try to swing me being a stay at home mom for a few years. So not only would we be going down in income, but I would have a baby when the wedding happened that I wasn’t willing to leave alone for a week (was a cruise so it’s the whole week or nothing!). She ended up calling me the next day and offering to pay for my entire family to come to the wedding... she said she couldn’t have a wedding without me and would rather pay to have me come than have a more expensive home wedding that she didn’t want. I don’t have many close friends so I was really blown away that I was THAT important to someone. 

Edit: My entire family did end up going! I had an infant and a 2 year old and it was a blast :) 

Wow thanks for the gold! I didn’t think anyone would care about my comment since it clearly isn’t a bridezilla story haha "
11,"I was having a party for my 13th birthday. I sent my crush an invite, a week after giving them out I found a bit of torn paper on the school field, I recognised the colour/pattern, then looked up and there was the rest of it, torn into tiny pieces. The kind of tearing that takes time and effort to get it into as many pieces. 10/10 would not be a teenage girl again."
12,I'm rolling because I made this deal with a friend that we'd marry each other if we weren't married by 30. But by 30 we were both married...to each other.
13,Had our daughter at 36. No regrets. We were financially stable and I was a much more patient person at 36 than 26 so I feel like I've been a MUCH better mom than I'd have been when I was younger.
14,"I made a deal with my best friend of 7 years. We even wrote joke “vows” and speeches. This was like 5 years ago when I was 30 and he was 26. 

“Well, here we are. 35 and unmarried. I couldn’t find anyone better so I guess we’re doing this thing”!

“You’re pretty cool. I like hanging out with you. This might as well happen!”

I turn 35 in April. 
We are getting married next year. I shit you not. "
15,"Perhaps my fondest memory of dating my wife-to- was the night we too a walk together after fooling around at her apartment. We'd been doing a lot of canoodling over the past few weeks, but hadn't quite had sex yet.

As we were walking, she very tentatively asked if we could talk.

""Sure"", I said.

""I think we're going too fast, "" she said in a rush, ""I want to slow down.""

 ""Oh, right, of course,"" I said. And then *started walking more slowly*, because what else could she possibly mean?

Twenty years now,and I'm still not allowed to forget that moment."
16,Yep.  I told her I wasn't even going to be able to attend the wedding (out of state in a rural hard to access area) because of health issues. I wouldn't have been able to afford the trip to begin with anyway.  She got upset and said I was just being cruel.  I guess she talked to someone else or had time to calm down and called me the next day apologizing for accusing me if trying to ruin her special day.  I mean I had been dealing with the same health issues long before she got engaged or even started dating the man she was about to marry.  (Also asking someone  in a wheelchair to attend a wedding in the forest off a hiking trail with no easy access isnt well thought out is it?)
17,"Yes, I did, back in college (30ish years ago). High school friend getting married asked me to be in her wedding. I declined because of cost and timing (was juggling college classes and wedding would be 2 1/2 hours away and I had no car). I felt bad but also couldn’t understand her rush to get married...wasn’t very good at empathy back then. She was gracious about my refusal as I had solid “reasons” which, in hindsight, look like excuses now. 

Many years later, planning my own wedding I realized how hurtful a refusal to my wedding party might make ME feel. We were no longer close but I had a tremendous amount of respect for how she handled my refusal. Fast forward a few more years and we reconnect on FB. One of the first things I did was apologize for not being there for her at her wedding. Standing with a friend as they start a new chapter in their life is a tremendous honor (or should be, not everyone thinks this way, I realize). She remained gracious and said there was nothing to forgive. She’s a class act. "
18,"Went out for lunch with a dude I had a crush on. Told him I liked him. He said, ""Are you aware of the concept of the friendzone?"" 

My friends and I have laughed about this for years."
19,"I didn’t decline but wish I had. My sister asked me to be MOH at her wedding. Her husband to be was the worst most obnoxious blowhard I’d ever come across. I tried really hard to find things to like about him because my sister.

The wedding was set for June and pretty much three months before that my already difficult relationship with my sister became disastrous. She constantly berated and undermined. Made over the top last minute requests, constantly told me how huge a mistake she’d made making me MOH but would not free me from my post.

I paid for 3/7 of the bridesmaids dresses, bachelorette party, pre-wedding hotel stay for 8+ ppl and pretty much endured the silent treatment for days before the wedding (including bachelorette party and rehearsal dinner). It was awful.

She broke her silent streak the morning of the wedding to tell me that she couldn’t marry her fiancé and needed me to help her run away. When I tried to help, immediately accused me of trying to sabotage her wedding.

They married and divorced in 2.5 years, but managed to have a child during that time. I no longer talk to my sister. I should’ve just said no. "
20,"When I was around 9 my best friend promised that he would marry me when we grew up, if I wanted that, so long as he didn't marry one of the millions of girls, that   he said would want to marry him in the future.

We fell in love when were 17, he didn't have anywhere near a million girls wanting to marry him, and now we're engaged. He's keeping his promise, but neither of us settled for each other. We love each other."
21,"I lost all interest in sex. It was literally a dead zone down there. Never even felt the need to masturbate and when I tried...nothing. No sensation. I went to several gynos for help and they all said the same thing....go on a date night. Bring romance into it. It didn't work. Next, my periods started being weird. I'd skip one, then bleed for three weeks. I'd also gained about 30 lbs for no reason that I could explain. As someone who never suffered cramps, they hit me and hit me hard. I was a mess. I found another new gyno and sitting on the table, I broke down. Ugly crying, could barely speak. She sent the nurse out and once I'd calmed down, i told her about it all. She ended up doing a complete blood workup, scheduled me for an ablation and didn't tell me to have date night. When my blood work came back, it showed that my testosterone was practically nonexistent. Explained the low libido, weight gain, and fatigue. She put me on testosterone cream and boom...hello libido. The weight took a little longer but I stopped gaining and worked to get the 30 lbs off. That went well, so I kept going. 42 down so far and about 15 to go. I feel so much better and it's all thanks to that one amazing doctor who  took a moment to actually HEAR me. I'm due for my yearly exam soon and I can't wait for her to see my progress.  

I had asked my old gyno about my hormones and she said if I was in perimenopause there was nothing she could do because they fluctuate. She told me to drink soy milk. I guess she's never heard of hormone therapy. I never went back to her. "
22,"Not exactly the same scenario but my grandparents were best friends with another couple before/during WWII. The two boyfriends (later husbands) were pilots in the Royal Canadian Air Force. And they had always agreed that if something happened to the other, that the surviving one would take care of the “other one’s girl”. And basically not leave one of them to be a single widow with no help I guess. 

Well they both survived the war but my grandparent’s friend’s wife passed away some time after the war of cancer, he remained very close friends with my grandparents. When my grandfather passed away in the late 1970s my grandmother married the surviving friend. They were married for many happy years and took care of one another until his death.  

It wasn’t until I was like 10 years old that I found out this man (who I lovingly also call grandpa), wasn’t my grandfather by blood. But instead was the best friend of my late grandfather. ❤️ I wish I could’ve known my real blood grandfather too, but I’m lucky to have had the Grandpa I did. It was around the time that this Grandpa (second grandpa) died that my parents told me the truth. 

Grandma is still kicking, she’s 96 now. "
23,"When I was 11 the boy I was crushing on said he didn't want to go out with me because I was ugly in front of all my friends. 

We ended up getting together in our late teens and we've now been together for thirteen years! He doesn't remember this incident but he is devastated that he ever said this to me, even as a child. "
24,Not majoring in something with the potential to actually get me a job. 
25,"Up until I was 15 I was in very high level gymnastics auntil I absolutely destroyed my right knee in a training fall. 


My periods were never very heavy which I think had a lot to do with over training at the time. I practiced 6 days a week so on practice days I just dealt with it with tampons, frequent breaks and made sure I had a change of clothes. 


I think I had two or three meets during my period and I always made sure I had a fresh tampon in before an event. Usually I'd be so focused on whatever I was doing I didn't think about it. 


Having said that I very distinctly remember a beam routine where in the middle of it I felt a trickle of liquid going down my leg. All of the sudden it hit me that I was on my period and maybe my tampon had failed me. In gymnastics  you get point deductions for messing with your leotard or adjusting yourself so I just prayed it wasn't blood and finished my routine. Crazily enough I was so focused on my inner thigh that my routine was probably one of the best of my life because I was just going through the motions I'd practiced a million times. 


When I was done I ran off the floor and into the bathroom and thank god it was just sweat. "
26,"I had my daughter when I was a couple months shy of 36.  My only regret in waiting is that it makes it unlikely that I will ever have more children of my own.  Otherwise, I was financially stable, had an established career, and was emotionally prepared to care for my little one.  I appreciate every moment I have with her and would do it all over again if I could.    


When deciding to wait, I would take into account how many kids you want to have.  Also consider that you might not get pregnant right away.  I had a miscarriage shortly after we started trying and then it took another year before I got pregnant again.  "
27,"I’ve said no at least three times because I absolutely hate being a bridesmaid. But each time I’ve offered to play violin for the ceremony instead. All three times I was taken up on the offer. 

Saved me the expense of being a bridesmaid, saved the bride $ on music for the ceremony (I always played these weddings for free), and I still got to be an important part of the event. Win, win, win. "
28,"Maintaining friendships with people that I liked, but too for granted their friendships/didn't put the effort in."
29,I knew that I needed much more affection that he was able or willing to give and decided to be free and happy. We were together several months and it got worse and worse as I saw how I was almost begging for mere scraps of attention and love from him while giving everything I had. I told him this and he just didn't get it. Ending it was absolutely the best thing I ever did.
30,"I did this, but we picked 29. It was someone I had dated for four years. We made the pact when we were breaking up at age 21. He wanted to settle down and I didn't want a family yet. We agreed we would reconnect and marry later in life.

He dated someone else and I dated a few people in the meantime. His gf left him for someone else about a year before we reconnected. I assumed he was the same person we were when we were younger, so we spent a few months living together and then got married!

Yup, nope, that didn't work. Currently working on the divorce papers!"
31,"Yes....I declined because I saw the groom to be picking up the bride by her neck. We were young, we were out clubbing, I don't know why these two were even trying to get married, this was back in say, 1998. Anyway, groom-to-be picks up bride by the neck, I call cops, they come arrest him, she bails him out same night. It was about 3 or 4 months later that they were getting married and she asked me to be the maid of honor! No can do I told her, I told her the truth. And she was okay with it. "
32,Gaslighting. Get the fuck out. He’s an asshole. 
33,"Got sat down for coffee with my bf of two years and he said ""I am bored of you now. Let's break up."" Then picked up his coffee and left. Tore at me for a while but I got over it. More pissed off than anything he wasted my time. 
"
34,"It’s not exactly a rejection, but it was me being completely oblivious and optimistic because a cute boy was nice to me.  I met a guy at a club meeting in college who I thought was pretty cute. He invited me to hang out a couple times to do homework or grab breakfast together in the dining hall and seemed into me-compliments and lots of eye contact and listened to me when I talked, etc. but never made a physical move.  But we were both 18 year old virgins meeting in public spaces so it wasn’t unreasonable to assume he was just shy, because I certainly was.  

After a while, he invited me to go see a movie, so I figured that this was like, a date.  I meet up with him at the movie theater and it turned out he was going with a group of people, and it wasn’t just the two of us. That should have been a signal, but nope. I spend the first half of the movie trying to snuggle up to him, hold his arm or hand, be cute, etc.  I finally started to realize that he was super not into it when I rested my hand on his knee and he picked it up and returned it to my lap. We got out of the theater, and he turned to me in front of everyone and said “You know I’m gay, right?”  If the ground could have opened up and swallowed me whole at that moment I would have welcomed it.  I felt awful that I’d spent an hour or so trying to snuggle with someone who was uncomfortable and too polite to tell me to back off and still cringe to think about it now.  "
35,"She sounds like a bad friend, i’m not surprised you said no! I always think if the bride is so set on a really expensive bridesmaid dress, she should probably offer to pay for it . . . "
36,"Read up on the neurochemical basis of falling in love. It's totally normal to want to move fast when you first start dating someone, the dopamine rush is addictive. You'll both crash around 4 to 6 months when the ""honeymoon phase"" wears off. This is the time to re-evaluate the person and decide if you want to stick it out for a long term thing-- once the rose colored glasses come off. Don't do anything permenently or semi-permenently binding before one year, once you've gotten to see them through 4 seasons, trials and troubles. Also-- brain chemistry stabilizes and pair bonding chemicals such as oxytocin kick in.

I don't think there's anything wrong with getting caught up in the rush of new love-- just know that you're on a high, and what goes up will come down. Just be aware, but have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:  


Wow-- I didn't expect so much response!

Congrats to those who did jump into living with an LDR and had it work! I personally think the LDR keeps us in that ""phase one"" zone-- love rush. like u/heart_of_blue pointed out-- visits are full of sex, romance, and ""everything else can wait"" mindset. We don't move to the next phases until we see the drop in dopamine. 

I don't have any specific books that discuss this but a quick google search ""neurochemical basis of love"" or ""falling in love neurochemistry"" should point you to some good reading. Basically-- falling in love this way is hardwired into us. We meet someone, get the love rush, wanna mate and shack up. After this is accomplished, the brain dials back the chemicals so that we ""get back to work"" so to speak-- got to provide for this family we've created. This can be a hard shift, it's like coming down from a few month's cocaine high. People will get moody. Lastly, the vasopressin and oxytocin pair bonding helps to ensure that the offspring will have a better chance at survival with two parents to care for them.

As a personal anecdote (for u/havebeenfloated and others)-- I'm living this. My current partner and I booked an overseas trip after knowing each other 3 weeks. We did family holidays at 4 weeks, and I pretty much moved in at 4 months (while maintain my own place to go if things went sideways. I just moved my day to day living things to his home.) At month 5, we both hit the wall-- he became a bit distant and moody, and I started having some serious doubts. Some health issues also threw a big wrench in our sexual life. The ""sparkle"" wore off, we crashed hard. We had a rough 3 or so months. I thought about this neurochemical model of love, and I'm thankful I stuck it out. Each day, I chose to see the good in him, and love him as a real, flawed person. I admit-- I panicked a bit over his reaction to the drop, but I reminded myself that he was just crashing off the love high. I stayed relitively calm on the surface compared to what I felt inside. Committed love is a conscious decision, not something we fall into or happens. There will come a moment when we sit with ourselves and ask “Is this what I want to do”. We're coming up on a year, and the mood has shifted again... we're not lovesick, we're not distant or doubting-- we're best friends. We have seen each other in our good moments and our bad, saw our dark sides... and offered up our deepest truths with vulnerability. That lovin’ feeling has returned, but in a tempered way—it’s deep, authentic, familial, and not “love rush high”.

38,"Friend of mine has been chatting with someone in another state and flirting for a couple weeks. 

The other day, they suggested she should fly for a visit, stay for a *month* and then just go ahead and *move in* if it works out."
39,"After living with my boyfriend (now-ex) for a couple of years, I was going through a bit of a depression. Things started to look up, and I was starting to put my life back together. 

We'd only had sex a few times in as many months, and he mentioned that when I was ready, he'd like me to initiate. He didn't want to pressure me. Great! He's been super understanding so far, and this just shows how how supportive he is. 

The next day I try to initiate because I have a cool, understanding, supportive boyfriend that I love. He stops me, and says ""Dont you want to lose some weight first? I don't want you to be upset if I can't get hard because of your belly flab"".

Noped out of that relationship real fast. "
40,"Right now I can think of these reasons:

Realizing they don't care about me as much as I cared for them. For example they contacted me only when they needed something from me, but didn't really included me in other things


Or just plainly started feeling dread  instead of excitement when I had to meet them.


Or realizing that they talked bad about me behind my back, or make fun of things that they know are important to me. 


Mix that with other minor factors, or together and it usually results in me distancing myself from them or cut them out completely depending on the intensity of those factors. 



"
41,"Really, it’s just when something makes me uncomfortable and feels forced or pressured. 

I can say something like “Saying I love you before three months is moving too fast” but every relationship is different. It probably is too fast for *most* relationships. But what they all have in common is that if you are moving too fast, on some level it feels wrong or concerning, and you’re doing it because of some pressure (either you think this is what you’re supposed to do, or you’re trying to hold onto someone, or you’re trying to achieve something, etc.)"
42,"41 year old mom of two. I had my first at 34 and my second at 37. My husband and I had a chance to have 4 years of marriage and 9 total together before kids. I could not agree more. Waiting let us have money, career flexibility due to senority, and stability. On top of that, we know who we are separately and as couple in a way we did not when we were younger. We got our crazy traveling and bar hopping years out together. We are now so content to be exactly where we are and that translates into calmer, more patient parenting with our kids. It also gives you perspective-- you lived as you before the kids, you'll be there after they leave the nest, so cherish the good days and on the bad it's easy to say this too shall pass. "
43,I had a girl that was my neighbor growing up and we made that pact that we would marry each other if we didn’t find someone else by 30.  She died at age 29. That was 6 years ago.  I’m 35 now and honestly kind of gave up on it. 
44,"Wedding date was set in stone before she asked me, and it was the week for on campus interviews at school. I told her that and that I was heartbroken.

She cursed at me and didn't speak to me for several years."
45,"Getting too attached too fast. I started talking to a guy online and after a couple of days he was already sending lovehearts and referring to me as 'his'. Cooled me off faster than the ice bucket challenge. 
"
46,"I did! The whole family went- I had two kids under two and they ended up having toddler be the ring bearer and did great! They got married in the early morning on the breach and then we had cake and all went snorkelling haha, so much fun! We ended up paying for our flights and any extra costs (hotel the night before the cruise mostly) and she covered our cruise cost. "
47,"Can confirm, am husband. We both dated people in between our promise and our wedding. I was even close to marrying the person I dated just before. /u/knowledgehungry and I were each other’s best friend for roughly a decade before we started dating, and then we dated for, what, six years before we finally tied the knot?

I definitely recommend marrying your best friend if you can manage it."
48,"How I acted toward my younger brother growing up. I was pretty awful to him. As teenagers, we started getting closer but I wasn't very affectionate even at my best. He died when he was 15 and I will forever regret that I never got the chance to apologize or be the sister he deserved. "
49,"Edit to add: This was a few years ago. I've kind of guessed why this might have happened (many of the reasons people are commenting combined probably) and I don't harbor any hard feelings towards the friend. I've even tried reaching out to her when I was going to be in town and didn't get a response, so I've let it go at this point. It's sad, but sometimes things things happen.

Whatever you do, dont do it like my one bridesmaid. She pretended she was so excited to be a part of my ~big day~ but in reality never bought the dress and called me a week before the wedding to tell me (she lied and said she bought the dress and it was just taking too long to have it altered and she was afraid it wasnt going to be ready) and asked if it was OK for her to wear a different dress in case. I said no because the dress was a different color/style entirely than my bridesmaids dresses. She then waited until the middle of the rehearsal (that she didnt show up for) to tell me she actually never bought the dress and she ""guessed"" she wasnt going to be in the wedding. I told her it was fine and that I hoped she would still come, because she was my best friend after all. Then she didnt even show up as a guest. We haven't spoken since and I still have no idea why she did it. 

I wouldn't have cared if she told me she didnt want to be in the wedding, regardless of reason. I mean,  I would have been bummed because she was my best friend of years, but it would have been fine. But the way she handled it in my mind just showed me that she completely did not care about me. It ruined our friendship. "
50,In the nick of time
51,"I made one with my best guy friend to be married at 30. I am 29 now and turn 30 next April, my friend would have turned 29 in March but he passed away 2 months ago from cancer. We spoke about this when he was sick and decided to push it back to 35-40 so we could enjoy life more but we were still down. I miss him everyday"
52,[deleted]
53,"Not quite marriage, but back when my best friend and I were about to start college at different schools (both 18), she said she didn't want to do the distance and she wanted a fresh start before college (her response to me saying we should just date).

She comes back from her freshman orientation canoe trip 2 weeks later (she went to an environmental school) and said ""fuck it I missed you lets date"". We are happily engaged now 6 years later :)

EDIT: to add to the sappy romance of it, we were long distance for a few years, seeing eachother only in the summer and then maybe once a month for a weekend. 

I proposed to her the second I saw her when I no longer needed to live seperated from her.

EDIT EDIT: I hope this doesnt get a lot of hate, but I only just now realized this was on /r/askwomen, I honestly didnt see what sub it was. I am a man. Sorry everyone, I am a great big phony. If it helps, she is a woman at least?"
54,"Actually yes, it was in 2003 (we were colleagues in school) and the pact said we'd marry by 2013. I met her many many years later in the tramway. We only had a moment because she was getting off. She gave me a false telephone number and that was that.

I don't think I brought up the pact, we were just catching up.

I was into her back then, but for the wrong reasons."
55,"I was intensely shy as a high schooler but as an adult I consider public speaking one of my strongest skills. A few things that have been helpful for me: it's easiest if you start by having confidence in your knowledge of what you're speaking about (so you can tell yourself, ""these people are here to learn and *I* am the one who can teach them"") - and it's even better if the topic is something you're passionate about! I'm a teacher and I'm one of my boss's go-to people to make presentations to parents at big meetings. It was a little scary at first, until I realized that I'm giving them information they want and need.

Also, it was extremely helpful for me to realize as an adult that, with the exception of the rare toxic audience, no one is judging you. They might be against some of the ideas you present, but it's not high school - they're not sitting there judging your voice or your outfit or any of the things that I was worried about as a shy teen."
56,A guy told me he was only dared to talk to me because I was the ugliest girl in the room 
57,I’m fairly certain that anyone who says being a teen was the best time of their life has retrograde amnesia as a result of a traumatic brain injury and just can’t remember because I’m pretty sure every single person between the ages of 12 and 18 experiences peak misery at one point or another.  
58,"When I got married I just had the girls pick their own dresses in a certain colour and material so they all matched that way, I had one friend who couldn’t afford really anything, but she found something she liked and it was in my guidelines, it wasn’t very expensive but she still didn’t have the extra money. So i paid for it because I didn’t feel like her family had to go without because I wanted her to buy a dress. Any decent bride.. or person should be doing that. "
59,"Same! 27 yo dude here, I had a girl friend who I was very close to, related to on everything, the exact same sense of humor, whom I greatly admired/respected, etc.  And thought she was just getting hotter and hotter everytime I saw her.  Never made a move until she broke up with her ex, we were being self-deprecating about our romantic histories/prospects, and we jokingly made a marriage pact where we said before like mid 30's, we'd get married.  NEVER had that kind of relationship before where we would even flirt, it was always very platonic (mostly because we were rarely ever single at the same time).

Last year I kissed her.  This past May I got down on one knee.  Next October we are getting married.  LIFE COMES AT YOU FAST"
60,"&gt; Anyway I’m 24 now and he slid into my DMs after high school and I told him to go fuck himself, which felt good.

I can't imagine what's going through his head that made this sound like a great idea. "
61,My friend did this with me. She said she hated being a bridesmaid and wasn’t sure she had enough PTO left. I was disappointed but I totally understood. Never mad at her and now we joke about it. 
62,"Not even a little. He is WONDERFUL. Mostly I’m just fascinated by how much I love him and have romantic feelings for him, despite not having those feelings for the first 6 years we were friends. They just kinda grew and it’s really nice. "
63,That was a rollercoaster
64,"Middle school. My best friend down the street and I tri d talking to the cute new neighbor kid. 


""Naw, y'all's foreheads too big""


Lifelong forehead insecurity ensued."
65,"We were in a restaurant and I accidentally bit my tongue. It hurt a little but but started bleeding quite a lot. He offered no sympathy, no ice, no help, he simply repeated over and over again ""I just don't understand how that's possible. *I've* never bit my tongue like that before! Absolutely baffling, I just don't get it. . I can't even imagine how a person bites their tongue like that .. . weird. . . "" 

Same thing one day we were walking on the sidewalk and I made the tiniest misstep (saying I tripped would be exaggerating, it was a misstep) and the same thing -- instead of just saying ""What was that? You ok?"" he just pelted me with questions about how there's clearly no huge pieces of debris on the sidewalk and he simply CANNOT COMPREHEND how I could have made a misstep. I want to punch him in his stupid face just thinking about that whole interaction. 

These are only a tiny examples, but I don't want to have to explain to the guy I'm dating how to act like a fucking human being. If your first reaction when someone hurts themself or makes a tiny mistake in front of you is to talk about how I'M SO PERFECT AND WONDERFUL THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO MEEEEE then you don't deserve me as a girlfriend or anyone else. 

I realized that for the time we dated, he never once considered me before himself, ever, and I'd be a fool to stick around and expect things to change. He faked it for the first month which is how I ended up dating him, but after he realized we were actually a thing he shut off all emotional support. "
66,"This story is from last year and probably still counts as my most painful (and also confusing) rejection. I had known a man for several years online and we had gotten VERY close. We met over World of Warcraft and we played together literally every day for 2+ years, talking on discord and eventually we started flirting a bit. He starts begging me to come visit him (as he lives across the country unfortunately), and I enthusiastically say yes because at this point I am stupidly in love. He spends months going on and on about his feelings for me, how he’s always liked me and how he’s in love, how I’m so beautiful and he can’t wait to kiss me etc etc. At this point he’s video chatted with me multiple times and seen many full body pictures of me, so he definitely knows what I look like...which brings me to the weird part. We finally meet and.....he treats me like a sister and seems really uncomfortable with the idea of kissing all of a sudden. The trip was very fun but I felt really rejected. I tried hugging him when we got back to his place and he was visibly uncomfortable, telling me that he “wasn’t ready to make a physical move” despite HIM being the one begging me to come be with him. I felt really rejected and repulsive, he even sat on a different couch from me across the room, despite telling me how much he wanted to cuddle for two years. Late that night I asked him what was up, and he said that he found our age difference “off-putting,” which really upset me because he knew my age since the day we met, and he’s not even that much older than me...it really felt like a lame excuse. To this day I have no idea what really happened. My only two guesses are that I look fatter IRL than he was expecting or that he had an IRL girlfriend or something. I’m still salty about the waste of time and money lol."
67,"My ex-husband and I definitely had a dead bedroom situation. To be totally honest, I’m not sure that either of us was ever super attracted to the other. Stupidly, I thought my sexual attraction to him would grow with time. I was young and learned the hard way how wrong I was.


In addition to that (and perhaps more importantly), he was an abusive alcoholic and cocaine addict. It’s really hard to want to have sex with someone who yells at you in public, chases you around the house, and corners you and holds you down to scream in your face because your tone of voice or expression rubbed him the wrong way. On top of that, like in many heterosexual relationships, the division of household and emotional labor was wildly disparate. Having to constantly clean up after someone’s messes and cater to their tantrums is NOT sexy.


The cherry on top, and I imagine this won’t come as a huge surprise in light of everything else I’ve shared, is that he put the responsibility for our sex life squarely on my shoulders. I was the one who needed to initiate, provide foreplay, and be on top until he orgasmed (one of my least-favorite positions). 


My needs were mocked, ignored, and in several instances used against me in episodes of abuse. I would literally cry during sex with him because I felt so alone and unloved. I’d still somehow manage to do it with him about twice a month despite how emotionally excruciating it was for me because I believed that if I could just be better the abuse would stop and things would go back to how they were before we got married. He actually had the nerve one time afterwards to say, “That was better. It’s not quite there, I think we need to be doing it more, but it’s improving.” I was glad I gathered up the strength to reply, “If you want to have sex more often maybe we could try making it enjoyable for me.” He looked dumbfounded, like it was some huge revelation, although of course nothing changed.


He and I split two years ago and our divorce was finalized a year ago. My libido has come back with a vengeance and I’m having mind-blowing sex with people who respect me and treat me as an equal. As it turns out, there wasn’t anything wrong with me. It’s pretty natural to not be inclined to fuck someone who treats you like dirt. We were together for 2 years and my only regret is not leaving him sooner.

Edit: Sorry about the formatting, I’m on mobile 😩"
68,I had kids at 27 and 35. Being pregnant at 35 was waaaaaaaaayyyyy harder. 
69,"He would subtly put me down throughout the day or do minor things that annoyed me like tickling, poking and prodding or make dumb loud noises. All of this happened on repeat all day every day and drove me to insanity. So naturally the sex drive died pretty quick. 
In a less subtle situation he would call me stupid/idiot and freak out at minor things, say he dropped a utensil while cooking or if he walked into my shoes by the doorway. It would result in me being yelled at. 
Don’t really want to have sex after a day full of that and I could never get it through to him that I want to feel loved and safe and not be on edge for when I’ll be yelled at next, then maybe I’d want to have sex. "
70,"Holy shit!

Related PSA: a partner choking you/grabbing you by the throat/putting their hands over your mouth (unless you’re into that, and it’s pre-discussed and consensual) is the most accurate predictor of whether your partner will ultimately murder you. The majority of women who’ve died from domestic violence were choked/strangled somewhere along the way. "
71,"An acquaintance sent me a very lovely heartfelt message via Facebook asking me to be her Matron of Honor. The wedding was in 2 months, she had done zero planning, I barely knew her, and I was going to be in another state the day of the event which was the perfect reason to use to decline. "
72,"My fiancè had an issue with oversexualizing every situation. Fair enough -- we're in our early 20s, so I wasn't too surprised. But it was ridiculous, and was the only time in our relationship he put 100% of himself into. There was no kissing, cuddling, or time alone together without sex. No dates or movie nights, birthday or Christmas gifts, without the expectation of sex. It became tiring, and made me feel worthless. 

Just broke up with him a week ago, and gotta admit, it's hard as hell, man. "
73,[deleted]
74,This is such a gracious thing to do. I know several people with siblings who have an agreement not to make them best man/maid of honor because they know how much that would mean to a friend and they already know the other is there. 
75,"I had a similar situation.

My friend asked me to be MOH and I accepted, a few weeks later I discovered I was pregnant. Due the same month as her wedding. So I stepped down.

She understood,  and was happy for me.

Her wedding date was later changed to a few months later. I still was not in her wedding party, which I sort of regret. But it was the right decision. I would have made a really terrible MOH with all I had going on.  We’ve since drifted apart, mostly due to circumstance."
76,"This is exactly where I am at right now. He says he absolutely cant give any more than he already is, and I just feel so unfullfilled. He's restricted the days I can see him only on the weekends and I get where he's coming from, but for me its just really weird and it hurts knowing he doesnt feel the same way about me as I do with him. 

But its also reeally hard to leave. I dont know why I like him so much. I keep wondering if I can really get what I want from someone else. Or if I should make due with what I have. "
77,"I know a middle aged punk who is married to a friend for tax reasons. He's gay, she has a boyfriend. 
As far as i know there havent been any problems, they are on very good terms. Only thing i picked up is that she would like him to write a will because of his very unhealthy lifestyle."
78,"Being a bridesmaid is a big cost and responsibility. There are a lot of micro events that lead up to a wedding: the shower, the bachelorette, dress shopping and fittings, etc.

It was better that you were honest and disappointed her one time instead of disappointing her multiple times by not being present and excited for each of the satellite events."
79,"He wanted a future in politics. I have a seriously fucked up family that would have stopped his career dead in its tracks.

This was back in the 80's when papparazzi started their love of digging up the dirt on candidates and raking them over the coals. Now, it's SOP, but back then, it wasn't.  

I knew that being married to me would ruin that. We'd been together 2.5 years (NOT living together) and I really suspected the proposal was coming at Xmas. He'd made hints, his best friend had made hints, his mom was suddenly getting cozy, and so on.

So, I stopped him before the proposal. We were at dinner and we had a serious discussion about where our relationship was going. I was straight up honest with him, that being with me meant politics was off the table for him.

We ended it that night. Heartbreakingly.  It hurt us both a lot.

He never did go into politics. He stayed a lawyer, didn't get married, and died three years ago from cancer. Truly sad."

82,"I got ghosted by a guy I had been seeing for a year. I saw him at a bar a few months later and he tried to come over and greet me like nothing happened but I stuck my hand in his face and walked away. Maybe not the most grown-up thing to do but he ghosted me so fuck him. 

Edit: thank you for the silver, kind stranger!"
83,"One of my friends was very sensitive and gave me the silent treatment for weeks whenever she was upset about something that I’d done. She’d never want to talk about it maturely, and would just leave me hanging until she decided that she was speaking to me again. 

The reasons for blanking me were petty (our mutual friends agreed) and I got fed up of walking on eggshells around her.

"
84,"I don't know if this is the kind of answer you are looking for, but.  According to my bf, he does like sex, but because of some things about me he doesn't want to, which I suppose makes me the cause.  My man says he is not attracted to me because my body type is not his style.  Also he says he is not used to ....smells.  So I'm supposed to diet and I have also gotten a clean bill of health from a gyno. 

So now I just don't feel wanted.  He says he'll have sex with me if I ask, as a favor to me because he loves me.  But last time I asked, he said ""I'm such a great bf, I haven't turned you down in two months!""  (4th time in two months btw).  So then it felt like he wanted a pat on the back for doing his chores.  So I stopped even asking for what always felt like pity sex, and now the bedroom is trully dead.  He never initiates, and I'm just not up to being a burden...."
85,"how the fuck can people do this to people they've been in relationships with? and LONG ones? 

romantic relationships are so damn scary, i don't want to spend years with someone only for them to easily toss me away"
86,Boners make thinky thoughts quiet
87,"My boyfriend's (at the time) brother's fiancé asked me to be her maid of honor. It was a shotgun wedding due to her pregnancy but it was also about 6 weeks away. I barely knew her and thought it was really weird. I told her she should choose someone she's known longer and has a deeper connection with or perhaps a family member. I also pointed out that if my bf and I broke up, she would probably hate having me in their wedding photos. That's got a weird reaction from everyone involved. We broke up just months later and he ended up going to prison after trying to kill me, assaulting the responding police officer and getting shot by said police officer. They were probably happy not to have either of us in their wedding photos. "

90,"Had a girl I had never met before call and ask me to be her bridesmaid.

She was a friend of a friend whom I had helped out years before by being a bridesmaid and doing all her flowers and such because she wasn't very well off... Apparently this girl thought I was some sort of volunteer paratrooper bridesmaid florist?  It was very weird.

I told her that I couldn't because A) I didn't know her and B) I was going to have a three week old baby at the time if my due date was correct and didn't want to drive 8 hours with a newborn.

She seemed ok with this and hung up, only to call again a few minutes later to ask if I was refusing because he was so much older than her and I was being judgmental and I said no, because I literally knew none of this because *I do not know you.  I have never heard of either of you before.* Which is again the major reason I would not be your bridesmaid...  

I wished her every happiness and hung up."
91,[removed]
92,"I said no three times. The first one was a so-so friend, and quite frankly, I was surprised to even be invited to the wedding, much less be in the bridal party. The man she was marrying was insane, so scary, but she thought he was charismatic and charming. He broke down a door to get at her when she had broken up with him. I was there and just terrified, the police were involved. She asked me, I was so scared of her future husband, I made some excuse and the friendship was over. We were 19. 

The second time, I was already standing up for my oldest friend on the same day and couldn’t even come to the other friend’s wedding. I was so sad, the bride was lovely about it, and totally understanding. We are still great friends. 

The final time was a woman that was part of the same group I hung out with regularly. I said no as is just gotten married and was broke with a capital B and we were friendly, not dear friends. I explained I’d already stood up in 3 weddings that summer. I’d also planned my delayed honeymoon during that time. It was fine. We are still friendly. "
93,"When I was about 14, a new kid came to our school and I made quick friends with him. We played on Xbox live a lot together. I developed a quick crush. 

He texted me to get on Live because he needed to tell me something.

""Hey, I wanted to tell you that I really like you"".

I am excited but pretty sure it was a joke. 

""Are you messing with me?"" 

""I really like you this is not a joke"".

I believed him. 

""Krissy, will you go out with me?""

I said ""Yes"". 

""APRIL FOOLS! I would never go out with you"". Then he laughed for a good few minutes. 

I left the call and was really hurt. He continued to bully me for a few years after that, telling me to kill myself and that I am ugly. No one likes me.

He moved away before Senior year and I got to actually enjoy my senior year without getting bullied. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for being so nice and reassuring me that this person was horrible and I never deserved what he did to me. "
94,"Yeah... he doesn’t love you, he’s using you for money but it sounds like you’re realizing you need to get out. Keep yourself safe start keeping important papers and your exit fund somewhere he can’t get to them and don’t give any signs that you’re planning on bolting. Make your plans quietly and when everything is ready ghost.

97,"I don't regret my major but I regret not doing anything that would help me find a job in my field. I majored in sociology, wanted to work in criminal justice or something similar. I didn't do any internships, volunteering or anything outside of school. Almost 10 years after I graduated, I'm working in IT because I couldn't find a job in my field, and everyone asks me why I'm working in IT instead of what I actually wanted to do in the first place. Well, if I could get there, I would! "
98,Wait so did you go to the wedding?
99,"Things about me? 

I have extremely intense emotional feelings for them and want to act on them. Go official super fast. Spend significant amounts of time together. Think about engagement. Talk about the future. 

Generally I can bring myself back down to earth, though. In this relationship I didn’t communicate those feelings to my boyfriend, and I’m glad I didn’t. Held it all in until it blew over, and I can see the relationship much more rationally now. We have been dating for a year and are fairly certain we are in it for the long haul unless life circumstances pull us apart, but I can also see it’s still too early to talk about things like marriage and moving in together.

102,"Omg I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.  I was once one of the ""witnesses"" in a scenario like this--I found out a guy was just playing a girl along as a prank, so I told her and she refused to believe me, which I totally understand.  Anyway, when the whole thing finally came crashing down I was mortified for her.  It legitimately affected my own relationships when I first started ""dating"" in high school--I'd think every dude talking to me was just playing a prank, even though I had no reason to believe that.  I know kids can be cruel, but this just seems beyond what's normal.  And I'm really glad you got to tell him off as an adult!  KARMA!"
103,"Friend of mine from high school married her high school sweetheart when we were 21 and asked several of us to be bridesmaids. I thought the wedding was a bad idea. I liked her boyfriend a lot, but the bride had just come out as bisexual after cheating on him with a girl - and the girl she cheated with was *also a bridesmaid*. It seemed like a bad time to get married.

I told her I couldn't make it because of transportation issues, and she was cool about it. The wedding went off without a hitch, and then 6 months later they got divorced because she was messing around with another woman again. She eventually came out as a lesbian and has only dated women since. She's still friends with her ex-husband, as am I, because he is really a great guy who was maybe just a little *too* forgiving."
104,That's sad because it demonstrated that she had no true friends if she chose an acquaintance who barely knew her.
105,"I’ve had friends in the past who were all “take” and no “give” you began to feel used up and as if you have nothing left to contribute. 

I’ve also had friendships end over change in lifestyle/habits. I am a recovering addict, I have 7.5 years sober, coming up on 8 in January, so this is not a new thing for me, I’m not fragile, just cautious and apprehensive. I can be around people who chose to drink or chose to party, but I chose to refrain as much as possible from those types of environments. And I’ve definitely lost friends because of that. I’ll occasionally go out with friends to a bar for a concert or something, but I don’t drink (drinking was not my DOC or my problem, but it could be my next problem if I allow it to be) I generally enjoy a Dr. Pepper or a Coke [exciting I know] but I have definitely ended friendships over people not being able to accept/understand my choice to avoid particular settings... I’ve been told “you’ve been sober for so long! And your issue wasn’t even with alcohol, so why do you avoid it like the plague...?!?” I will only explain myself one time... If someone can’t accept or understand my point of view after that, I’ll begin to withdraw from them. Sorry but I have a healthy sense of self preservation... I worked VERY hard for my sobriety, and my life is significantly more meaningful and full than it was at the time I was using, and I won’t risk that for anything or anyone. "
106,"For some back story, we had a dead bedroom years ago, but it was on his end. It's strange how the tables have turned.

I think it started with the hormonal changes from pregnancy, breastfeeding, and sleep deprivation. Then it was the stress of raising kids. Weight gain. Death of parents and caregiving for parents. There was insane amounts of stress. Autism.

my husband wants to come home from work and flop on the couch. if he has to do want more than one or two things for the kids, he gets angry. He's always talking about how happy he is that the kids are in bed and he doesn't have to deal with them when he comes home.

he doesn't purr taking the actual raising of them. He gets to do the fun dad stuff, like very occasionally play with them. he doesn't have to worry about therapy, insurance coverage, who ate what for breakfast, if they took their vitamins, the last time they sat on the potty, nothing. I'll leave and come home 2 hours later and ask if he took the kids to the potty or change diapers, and he'll often tell me he hasn't had a ""chance.""

he only started lifting a finger around the house a few months ago. He will put laundry in for me. Where was he when I was caregiving as well? His only responsibility is mowing the lawn, and half the year that's not even an issue, and maintaining his own car. 

Plain and simple: I don't feel respected or loved. He does whatever he wants. I'll be listening to music and he'll walk in and turn it waaaaay down without even asking me. Just because he can hear it and doesn't like it. he shows very little concern for me. He's concerned about whether or not I'm going to be leaving and he's going to be stuck with the kids. That's all he cares about.

Sleeping with him is like sleeping with a stranger. No thanks. 

to be honest, I've been in the dead bedroom subreddit, and I do think that most of these men who are in the situation are lying to themselves. I do think sex drives can wane as the years go by, but they don't just completely stop. If there's a dead bedroom, both people need to work to find a solution. I think it's pretty rare that it's completely one-sided. 

I think situations like mine are not unusual. there's an expectation that one partner will go to work, then come home, and the day is done. The other is expected to raise the kids, juggle family affairs, and then have the energy for intimacy. That level of constant strain is bound to create resentment, especially if the workload is uneven."
107,That is unbelievably cruel. My heart hurt a little bit for 11 year old you while I read that. 
108,That sounds like such a perfect resolution! I wish I had skills I could offer to a wedding (besides eating four times the recommended portion size - which I don’t think is really useful for a bride and groom). 
109,"Just some random scraps of thoughts on this topic. Every single human trait exists on a spectrum, eg. some women want children, some don't, some are somewhere in between; some people want sex all the time, some not at all, others are in between. Some people just aren't cut out to be in relationships, they would actually be happier being single but the societal pressure for everyone to pair up and find their soulmate makes these people think they should be in a relationship because that's what you're supposed to do.

Some people can be amazing human beings in all other aspects, but just not good at being in intimate relationships. It's okay to still love them AND love yourself enough to walk away.

TLDR; find someone who matches your level of emotional intimacy needs in a relationship."
110,"How. My lower back fatigues so quickly on my period, my god"
111,"A friend of mine had a childfree wedding, but also hired a babysitter to be on-site in a separate room with toys and crafts where the kids could hang out while the festivities were going on, which made things easier for the parents who were invited. I bet the kids had way more fun that way, too - I remember being pretty bored at the one or two weddings I went to as a little kid."
112,"Heh I know that irrational fear so well. I have had leaks before, but rarely in my life have I ever had the kind of leak that breaks through pad/tampon, underwear and pants, or anything I could actually feel trickle. And yet, I get paranoid about it even when I'm not on my period."

116,In fourth grade my bf broke up with me by slamming a basketball in my face on the crowded playground. 
117,"My sister had a destination wedding in the beginning of August of this year.  I have three sisters, and the one getting married is the youngest one.  All of the sisters would be bridesmaids (plus like 5 of her best friends).  Problem was, I got pregnant and my baby was due in the middle of June.  Fortunately, she was also pregnant and due in March, and she totally understood.  The timing was so borderline.  If he was born on his due date, he would only be 7 weeks old by the wedding.  They recommend waiting until two weeks after the 6 weeks vaccinations to fly, but they could do the vaccinations as early as 4 weeks.  If he was early, we might be able to make it.  If he was late, maybe not.  This was also my first child, so I had NO clue what to expect.  Maybe it would be chaos and traveling was a horrible idea.  I just had no way of knowing.

As it turned out, I had an induction 5 weeks early due to a medical emergency.  I missed all of the wedding planning stuff due to being sick and then having a newborn.  But baby was healthy, really easygoing, and it was looking like I was going to be able to go.  Not only that, but my husband wanted to take two weeks of his parental leave so that we could take a family vacation just the three of us.  We were going to island hop for two weeks, visit one of his friends, etc.  We were so excited.  I told my husband that I would book our travel and accommodations for Oahu first (where my sister was getting married) and the rest of the trip was up to him.  I was down for whatever.  I bought my bridesmaid dress and booked our travel.  Everything was coming up Millhouse.

Then my husband passed away suddenly two and a half weeks before the wedding.  Obviously I was a total fucking wreck.  But literally all of my family was going to Hawaii for the wedding.  My in-laws live across the country from me.  Nobody wanted me to be left alone so they insisted baby and I still come to Hawaii.  One of my sisters helped me cancel my husband's flight, move mine so that I wouldn't have to travel alone, cancel my accommodations and crash in their room with the baby.

Now, I thought it was obvious I wasn't going to be in the wedding anymore.  I thought I didn't have to have that conversation.  It was already always up in the air whether I would be able to attend the wedding at all, let alone be a bridesmaid.  I thought it would be clear that a wedding would be *really fucking hard for me* as it is.  I didn't want to ruin all the videos and pictures with my thousand yard stare, running mascara, and bags under my eyes.

Well, it just never occurred to my baby sister that I wasn't still one of her 8 bridesmaids.  God love her, she is amazing and thoughtful and the most loving and sweet person I know.  But she just had a lot going on and she probably hadn't thought about it.

The day of the rehearsal, I put the baby in a stroller and hoofed it from the resort.  We walked around Waikiki and I tried to not be desperately miserable behind sunglasses.  I took pictures of my son with the Duke Kahanamoku statue, bought and ate a rapidly melting pineapple soft serve cone, and window shopped.  My parents called me and told me to come back to the hotel so we could ""go shopping"" so I sighed and went back.  When I got there, they were like, OK we're going to the rehearsal.  I said, uh you guys are, I'm not.  They said, ""[your sister] wants you there.""

I thought it was weird, but I went.  And I sat in the back with the baby while everyone chatted and got directed around.  Then the wedding coordinator kept making references to where I'll be standing and sitting, etc.  All the bridesmaids and groomsmen and my sister and brother in law were standing fanned out up front, when the wedding coordinator started talking about where in the order I will be standing during the wedding (mind you, at this point I'm sitting in the third row with my baby).  

So I said flatly, ""I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm not a bridesmaid.""  And my sister, standing.. where the bride stands... in front of everyone says, ""yes you are.""  And I said, ""I thought you knew I wasn't going to be.  I didn't have time to get my dress hemmed.  I didn't even bring my dress.""  LONG PAUSE.

I don't remember what happened after that except for they reset to do the whole march again and I picked up my baby and walked away to sob behind some bushes.  Once I got all my shit together I went back and watched the rest of the rehearsal.  Afterwards I *immediately* went back to the room, where one of my sister's friends was working on handwritten name cards.  

That friend was the first people who had donated to a GoFundMe after my husband died, so as soon as I parked my stroller in the room I started crying and thanking her.  She gave me a big hug and I told her about how I had a mega meltdown during the rehearsal, and she held me and told me it was OK, that it's understandable.  My sister walked into the room while I was crying and she gave me a big hug.  I told her that I was sorry, I messed up her rehearsal, and I should have told her I wasn't going to be her bridesmaid.  She said it was OK, she wasn't mad.

SO yeah.  That's how that went.  The wedding was hard for me, but I was happy for my sister.  She still included me as much as I was willing to be included.  She still had my makeup and hair done, and I was in her video a little and in family photos.  During the reception my sister and BIL gave a speech, and she gave a shout out to my husband and I ugly cried.  Anyway, I'm still glad that I went.  I love my sister, she was there for me when I had my baby and she was there for me when my husband died.  I wish I could have been there for her during her wedding, but I did the best that I could.  Super glad I wasn't a bridesmaid, though."
118,"* 'Love bombing'- Intense attention and affection way too quick
* They get too possessive too quick
* You feel like you can't tell your family/friends about it/have to hide
* OR you have them meet your friends and family like right away 
* They spend a lot of time at your place right away, or vice versa 
* You withdraw from your friends and family to spend a lot of time with this person "
119,"I'm going to ask my doctor for a more thorough hormone check, thanks to yout comment. My libido went completely AWOL after my hysterectomy (still have ovaries). This gives me hope that there could be a reason for it."
120,"He was very suffocating. He had trust issues, which I can understand given his ex. It was fine, started with him just going through my phone. That's okay. Then he started checking up on me at work. Then I couldn't go out unless he went, not even to the store. He started to get a temper, explosions of anger. wanted kids right away again. I said let's wait, I had a year left of school, he packed his bags and went to his sisters. 

Turns out he had some very serious depression and other issues going on, and had not seen anyone for it. Serious to the point of threats, psychosis, and violence. He ended up being admitted to a psych unit. This was 2 years ago. We've spoken recently, He s doing much better, but the problem was we weren't close when we got back together so he didn't feel like he could lean on me, let me in on these feelings, and his emotions came out as restrictions and explosive anger. I'm sure I wasn't the most receptive to his problems. Neither of us got the partner we wanted out of the deal. It was a great learning experience for me though! And I'm glad he's doing better."
121,Most extreme athletes get a very minor period. I've never had an issue with my period while playing. I barely notice it. TMI: I can free bleed. The only time I have a heavy period is in between seasons when I've been lazy and let my diet slip.
122,"A reverse situation for me. I agreed to be in a wedding, got pregnant and was 38 weeks on her wedding day (had my baby 9 days later). I was HUGE, uncomfortable and still had to do my job as a bridesmaid. I sucked! I felt like I stole some attention from her by just being so ready to pop, naturally people noticed lol and there were some awwww’s when I walked down the aisle.

I should have said no. ETA: there was also a choreographed dance the bridal party performed. I sooo should’ve said no."
123,"I've been a bridesmaid four times. I declined to be one the fifth time because the bride was one I'd already done the honor for-- nearly three years earlier. All the fuss, engagement gift, shower, dress and hair, two bachelorette parties. It's not easy to say, ""sorry, aren't you going to have a longer engagement and think about why your first time around didn't work?"" 

I told her I was glad she was so happy but didn't enjoy the responsibilities of being one. (Travel, dress fittings, parties, general fuss) Got and invite as a guest, but I declined and sent a gift. They did the whole nine yards again.  Photos from the second wedding basically had the same people as the first-- although her parents look far less joyous in the second batch. They are still married and expecting a child soon. Happy ending, fingers crossed. "
124,"Ended my 5 year relationship, quit my job, sold all my stuff and moved overseas. Like an early life crisis. Don't regret a thing."
125,"Yeah, I used to volunteer at a battered women's shelter and one of our big questions for women coming in was ""did your partner ever choke/strangle you?"" Of course, we tried to take care of every woman who came in, but when beds were really full and there was concern about women returning to their abusers we had to focus most on those who had been choked. The shelter had already experienced women returning home and getting killed and it was always the ones who had been choked. Right before I started working there, actually, one of the women staying had decided she needed to tell her husband in person that she was leaving him. So she went back to the house and told him and he beat her to death. That's why it's also recommended to have a police escort if you're leaving an abuser. You are in more danger when you leave. You need help and a place to hide. You need your stuff from the house? Call the police. They will come with you. Never agree to meet one on one, never agree to meet anywhere besides a public location. An abuser views their victim as something they own. Once their victim tries to leave, shit can really hit the fan in horrible ways. "
126,"When I was 16 I was in love with this guy I was friends with. He was into me too and we we're relatively inseparable for a few months. I noticed he started seeming like he was into one of my friends. 

The one day we we're sitting in class together and he was acting weird. We had recently taken a class trip to Canada and one of our friends took a picture of us on the bus. She came up to us and excitedly gave us the picture she took of us hugging. He grabbed it out of her hand and ripped it into a million pieces. I was absolutely horrified and had to run to the bathroom so I didn't start crying in front of everyone. "
127,"Yes, my older sister was getting married and didn’t actually ask me or any of our siblings to be part of the wedding (besides asking me to do the makeup). My mum (reasonably) got upset as the grooms sister was asked to be a bridesmaid the second the ring went on my sisters finger. So my sister asked us (me and my younger sister) to be bridesmaids, when she called to ask me her exact sentence was ‘I’m asking out of courtesy more than anything, but would you be a bridesmaid?’ I simply said I would think about it and then rejected it by texting her no. Yes she was made to ask us but she could’ve been a little nicer about it, my younger sister said yes and magically ended up being kicked out of the wedding (for something minor) before the dresses had been officially ordered and confirmed."
128,"To be exact, it was 5 years and 4 months. Obviously I agree with the whole marrying your best friend lol "
129,"Yes. I broke up with my ex and it’s the best decision I ever made. 

I realised my emotional needs weren’t met, but I thought I didn’t have realistic needs or expectations, because I’ve seen so many romcoms. After I broke up with him and I finally started letting my friends back into my life, I talked to them about what I was missing. I told them about the times he told me I could be good looking if I lost some weight, the times he bought me a present and then immediately asked me when I was going to post it on facebook or if I had shown it to my friends and family yet, the time he didn’t pick up my antibiotics when I had a high fever because he didn’t feel like it and I had to go get them myself, the times (almost always) he didn’t feel like getting groceries and I had to walk to get them myself and carry those heavy groceries home even though he could’ve easily driven me to the store so we could’ve gone together. He hated the sound of my voice and got mad if I interrupted him when he was talking for 15 minutes straight about an issue at work (just to ask a question to understand the story better). He always tries to prove he was better than me at the things I enjoyed doing. He told my parents that he only proposed to me because I finally stopped whining about wanting to get married, even though I only mentioned it a couple of times. I could go on and on. 

Now I’m in a loving relationship of almost a year. We respect each other, we apologise, we talk about the little things and I’m incredibly happy. I can’t believe I’ve ever thought a genuine love like that wasn’t out there and I’m happy I get to come home to him and kiss him good night.

I just want to say, if you feel like your needs aren’t met, no matter how big or small the issues you may have, you should trust that gut feeling and find happiness. "
130,"I was in a wedding where the bride wore a lavender dress, and the only rules for us bridesmaids was darker purple than her dress and not floor length. I got one on sale for like $40 that I was also able to wear to two more weddings I attended that summer (and after). I like weddings like that."
131,"Had my son at 41 and twin girls at 44. I wasn’t planning to wait this long but that’s how life turned out. I wish I’d had them ten years earlier. I’m pretty much always exhausted. If you wait this long, be in good shape and active. It’ll help. I’m also usually about ten years older than most of my kids’ friends’ parents. This can make it a little challenging on the social side. Try to get involved with the school (PTO, volunteering, etc.) to stay in the group. It’s good to know what your kids are up to with their friends. Stay abreast of pop culture, technology, and what’s happening in the world of parties, sex and drugs. If you’re ignorant you’re going to get bit in the ass. Don’t ever let your kids think you are THAT out of touch. As a woman, I’d have to say it interrupts your career a lot more at this point. It’s harder to get back into the work force at 50+. Positives? My kids have great taste in music. 😉"
132,"That makes me so sad :-( your poor mam was probably just as excited for you, aww god love you and your mother this has really upset me I hope this never happens to my daughter. "
133,"Worst period of my life. I had literally just gotten out of an abusive relationship that involved several instances of rape as well as physical assault. I had rampant PTSD, knew it, and was (foolishly) trying to fill the void with alcohol and other people.

Met someone on Tinder. He was a medical student and really smart, funny, handsome, and nice to me. I was wary about getting used or hurt again, so I made it my policy not to meet anyone in person that I hadn’t spent some time talking to. We texted pretty much nonstop for weeks. I even opened up about my mental health and he was seemingly kind and responsive. Planned a date. The night before we had planned to go out, he was in the area and invited himself over to my apartment. I insisted that he not come because, as I said, my mental health was not in a fantastic place and my apartment was in bad shape. But he insisted it was fine, that he didn’t mind, that he accepted me and just wanted to spend time with me. So I had him come by. 

We talked for a bit, and he started kissing me. One thing led to another and, I don’t know — I didn’t really feel ready for it, but I didn’t feel that was important. We ended up having sex. It was a nice night, though. We talked about plans for the next night, and it was implied that he was into me and we’d be seeing each other again. There was no indication whatsoever that anything was wrong on his part. Then he left in the morning.

Again, we’d been texting nonstop and it just slowed to a halt. He blew off our date. A couple days later, I asked him what was up, and he essentially said that I was too messy for him and that it had put him off. Then I never heard from him again.

Really felt like there was something between us. I’d basically let him earn my trust, and then he bolted once he got his notch. That really fucking hurt. 

Edit: Ahh, thanks for the silver! I don’t think I’ve ever gotten silver before!"
134,"Lost my virginity to my boyfriend at the time. Two days later he dumped me via text, the whole “it’s not you, it’s me” thing. To a freshly 18-year-old girl though, that obviously means nothing.

Happy ending: after that, I vowed to never have sex with someone I couldn’t see myself marrying ever again (100% just a personal choice for myself, have no issue at all with casual sex but it wasn’t something I wanted). Sure enough, a year and a half later at 19 years old, I met a guy that seemed to check all of my boxes. I moved forward, deciding that even if we didn’t end up married, it was worth it because he showed me how I wanted to be loved by someone. We’ve been together for 7 years, married for almost 5!"
135,"Yeah, just over 3 years later and they’re divorced though, so I probably have a few more chances to be a bridesmaid for her"
136,"The combination pill allows some control over when periods happen. The traditional way to take the pill is to take 21 pills and then take 7 days off to allow a bleed to occur. But medically there is no reason you can't take more pills between the breaks to have bleeds less often and ensure they occur at convenient times.

(Some people can take the pill 365 days a year, with no breaks, and never have a period at all. Medically it's perfectly safe to take the pill that way, but it results in unpredictable bleeding for many people.)"
137,"Would being a foster mom count? For me, being a bit older gave me more stability and perspective to help teenage kids, money to support us all, and a more solid marriage to show the kids. And since I didn't have the burden of pregnancy, and the physical risks of going through that as an older ""mom,"" it was a great choice. That said, there are many valid reasons to not want to wait to have bio. kids - there is no way I'd go through pregnancy at an older age. So, for being a foster mama, I have 0 regrets"
138,I completely understand why a couple wouldn't want to have children at their wedding and their guests should respect their wishes. 
139,"I'll tell this, despite being the rejectee:

We had been dating for two years, and I was about to move away across the country. She was a year behind me in school. I proposed about a month before I was supposed to move, and she rejected me. We talked it through, and I really understood her perspective on the situation.

She didn't want our relationship to be driven by these major life events. The timing made it seem like the only reason I was proposing was to just keep us together. We talked it through, stayed together, and I ended up proposing again about another year later. 

We've been married for 3 years now!"
140,"If you find that person as a co-worker again, does the timer resume?"
141,I’m a guy and had a very similar experience when I was 10 or 11. Wasn’t a crush or anything. Was a “friend”. Rode my bike. Same thing happened. Was hurt. But ended up having a lot of fun riding my bike around town. 
142,"Depends on your definition of ""dead"". 

Low libido + having 4 pregnancies in 5 years (just had our second child 3 weeks ago) = I haven't felt up for sex in a very long time, and we can go several months without it.

My husband is understanding. He also doesn't want to have sex with me if I'm not actually wanting to have sex with him, so I don't ""suck it up"" or force myself to power through my fatigue and touch aversions just to make him happy. It's a really big turn off for him to feel like I'm just going through the motions and don't actually want to do it, and would rather just wait until I'm legitimately wanting to do it.

I check in with him often to make sure he's still fine with our situation. I make sure to show intimacy in other ways. We love each other and our marriage is about so much more than sex, so we're riding out this period of infrequent sexual  contact. We're still very in love and very happy, even without the sex. It'll be even better once my libido comes back and we're not trapped in baby/toddler sleeplessness hell."
143,"Just a couple weeks ago. I was dating a good friend, but I realized that while as friends we were fine, I didn't like the look of her life when it was *mine*. There were dozens of things, but it came down to that I felt like the best parts of myself were being smothered while with her.

The moment I decided was when for my birthday, a couple of my best friends in the world took me away for a weekend, and I felt so awesome, like I was really getting to be my best self with them again (I had lived with one of them previously and it was the best time of my life). My gf at the time texted and said she wished she was there. I realized that if she were, I wouldn't be having a good time at all, and I was glad she couldn't come. 

I waited a month because my gf's 30th birthday was coming up, but once I realized how miserable I was there was no going back. 

I've really been enjoying these last couple weeks single. "
144,"There's a saying that you're the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with.  If those people don't share the values you're trying to attain, it's time to make an evaluation of that friendship.  I had to cut out some racists/bigots from my life b/c I don't want their BS reflected on me as an individual.

Edited to add: I dropped a friend from my life after realizing how toxic they were as a general human being.  Ie. living to see others fails, gossiping about everyone, making poor decisions with men, oversharing their sex life with random people.  And the kicker was the time I saw her giving a guy a hand job through his zipper in a bar.  "
145,"My former best friend and I did this in highschool. Thought it was pretty cute at the time. 6 years later I start dating my current girlfriend, she flips out on both of us, I try to fix it, she flips out some more and now we haven't talked in a year. 

Sad story. "
146,"Yup, in my early 20s.  The person I made it with has literally ghosted me since I got married.  It started as a joke, but I think he actually had some hopes there and I feel bad about confusing him.  I think if someone suggests this there's a good chance they're carrying a torch for you and pretending not to.  I am still a bit hurt that he treated me this way, we'd known each other since we were teenagers and despite him having an interest in me years ago he swore blind it was a crush and he was over it.  If I'd known he was secretly still into me I'd have distanced myself earlier instead of staying closer; I feel a bit betrayed that he had an ulterior motive all along and lied about it.  It was like 'oh you're married, there's no point me keeping up this charade any more'.  No nice guy crap, but still, it's a little hurtful.

Frankly if you don't want to be with someone now, there's no point suggesting that you might in the future, even in jest.  Sure, friendships can turn into love, but it's good to be very clear about your feelings and not make people feel there's a small chance you'll settle for them.  It's demeaning to both sides.

Edit: I decided to give the guy a hello on FB just for old times sake and got a nice reply, turns out he's met someone he really likes and settled down, so hopefully we'll get past this now that it's been a few years.  He's one of my oldest friends and I can understand how things might have gotten a bit confused, so here's hoping it's all water under the bridge."
147,"Yes, similar thing. I changed high schools senior year. I was very punk rock, at least in my own estimation, With bright pink hair, and aggressively stand offish after several years of domestic violence. 

In an advanced science class this very clean cut guy from “the cool table” would come up and try to talk to me. My assigned seat was close to the front door and he’d stop by to talk a lot. He’d ask for music recommendations or about the book I was reading. Then eventually he’d go to his table. 

I’d see them laughing and chatting and assume they were making fun of me. In retrospect I doubt it had anything to do with me. 

At the end of the year he said “would I have had to dress in all black for you to go out with me?” And I laughed and said, “go back to your cool friends it’s not funny anymore.” 

Baffled he left. I always thought he was just teasing and showing off to his friends that he was messing with me. 

Then a few years later I ran into him at a concert. And I was in a much better emotional place, and we chatted for a few minutes and he seemed genuinely happy to see me, and to see me happy and more friendly. 

A few minutes into it a cute pink haired girl dragged him up to where his other friends were. And I was like oh, he wasn’t a jerk he’s just into that. 

I truly hope they’re happy. He was actually a really good person in a time in my life I didn’t believe in good people. "
148,She CURSED at you?? That’s awful! 
149,"This is the reverse story. When I was 15 a guy at school asked me out on a date. I assumed he was making fun of me so I didn't say anything, just walked away. I was pretty proud of my response at the time considering I usually said something awkward made things worse when people made fun of me. Didn't occur to me until years later that he may have been serious. "
150,"I dropped out of high school. I was depressed, lonely and had severe performance anxiety, and just couldn't deal with it, so I quit and took a job instead.

Practically, it doesn't really matter. I work as an illustrator now, I get to pick my own hours, work from home and make decent money on something I genuinely enjoy doing. But I still feel like not having an education means I've failed in life, and that it makes me less worth as a human - I've certainly noticed that's what a lot of other people think. In any case, I feel like a failure for not being able to finish school.

Also not being able to maintaine close friendships, I guess. I don't think it's 100% my fault, but still.

Edit: Thank you all for your supportive and encouraging comments. ♥"
151,Do you feel like you've settled?

153,"Usually an Askmen thread pops up at the same time AskWomen does, but for now, I'll just share here if it's ok. 

There was a really cute redhead cop or sheriff who used to come to the same gym as me and just walk on the treadmill for 3-5 miles...EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I had talked to her a few times and she seems friendly enough, smart, so I kept talking to her. No real intentions of asking her out, but I did enjoy our banter. 

On this faithful Monday evening, as I'm wrapping up my workout and she's walking her 500 miles just to walk 500 miles so I stop in for a quick chat. It starts off innocently enough, but pretty quickly she starts spewing some nonsense about ""leagues"" and the audacity of certain guys to approach her and if I'm (referring to me) the best she can do, she's just gonna give up dating altogether. 

I walked away without saying a word, but she followed me out with some final advice of, ""I guess you shouldn't talk to me on a Monday."" I follow that sage advice, which works so well, I've extended it to the rest of the week."

This is the one for me. I'm too old for that highschool shit. I'm not going to beg you to hang out with me. I had a friend who was such a half-assed friend. Wouldn't get together unless I came to her place. Would cancel on me last minute if something better came up. Never came out for my bday but expected me at hers. When she disappeared after starting to date a new guy, I just let it happen. Two years later she reappeared claiming she missed me and wanted to reconnect. I told her thanks but no thanks."

I send the photo, and he replies back: "".....eh.... Got anything better to impress me?""

His reasoning when pressed was ""well, you're just so hot, I just wanted you to send more pictures!!""

Nope. 

I stopped talking to him shortly after."
166,I wish I could upvote twice. 
167,"Not OP, but my mother did something similar and says the same thing. She said the later one was harder because her body couldn't handle things as well. Her back was more sore more often at the older age and being pregnant multiplied all those problems by 100, whereas when she was younger it was much more manageable. Her legs were more tired and worn too and she found herself crawling to the bathroom or not making it, but before she always managed to struggle to her feet and be ok. She just physically couldn't do it like she could when she was younger.

If you ask my dad all he'd say is that it was harder to keep up with the baby and they got tired sooner. I think he didn't even realize that half of what my mom went through while carrying. "
168,Not standing up for myself 
169,"She may be one of those people who are friendly and helpful to others but don't let them get close easily. As funny as it sounds, you need to let others be there for you as well as being there for others to make closer friends."
170,"I turned down an opportunity to be in a wedding party on the summit of Longs Peak in Colorado.  Start hiking at 3 am so we could be off the summit before the afternoon lightening storms killed us. Sounds great!

TLDR a chubby bride thought her chubby friends would all enjoy hiking up a 14K foot mountain for a sunrise wedding. "
171,"We were at crossroads: he was 29, unemployed, uneducated and unhappy with that situation, but also didn't know what to do about it. It had been going on for years, and I felt it wasn't my job as not-his-parent to boss him about his life, but I was also very tired of having all the responsibilities. So I rejected and explained why I was unhappy. It cleared the air and I finally managed to acknowledge I wasn't really happy with the relationship. So far I'd claimed not wanting marriage was because I didn't want to be a statistic (but failed to say aloud it was because I was pretty sure it would have ended in a divorce), and because I hate being the center of attention (still true). 

He turned his life around, and proposed again a month ago. Getting married next year. It melts my heart to see him so happy and active. "

Edit for those that asked me to explain further (and thank you for the support of this radical notion!): 

Based on my experience, noticing where I put disproportianate energy trying to ""figure out"" the other person is generally a good clue. Healthy relationships aren't mysterious riddles; it's not my job to assess for cause and effect -- ""did my bad mood put them in a bad mood"" quickly followed by where I would go with it: ""Oh, I guess I should keep my moods to myself.""

For me, getting to know my needs is the only way I can begin to authentically show up in relationship. If my focus is first on the other person, I'm already clinging to some idea of a relationship that hasn't yet proven healthy or worthy of me. So, while I'm trying to manipulate ends by making sure the other person is happy, I'm admitting that I don't feel confident the other person can show up for me as I am in that moment. I'm already altering the conditions. I'm already assuming some hard limits to being accepted and loved. I'm turning the lock of my own prison cell. 

To address that, I have to work hard to accept what my reality is, without needing to be different to be loved and accepted. It also means being responsible for getting to know myself, so I don't inadvertently act out resentments I'm not dealing with. 

The process for me looks like a lot of different things: ""Hey, what do I need in bed to feel satisfied?"" instead of valuing myself based on their own satisfaction. ""Hey, what is bugging me that I need to say?"" instead of trying to keep the peace by silencing myself. ""Hey, I'm feeling X or Y and I don't have a story about it yet but can I just be tender about it for a second?"" instead of needing to have a tidy narrative or reason-away my feelings. It's being solid in my experience as is, without deferring to another to fill in the gaps of my self-understanding.

(As an aside, I should say I think it's very important to do charitable things for our partners and to think of their needs alongside ours or sometimes even above ours. So I'm not talking about always putting ourselves first. I'm talking about the preoccupation with trying to make them happy by minimizing our own needs and subsequently giving them a softer version of ourselves and our reality. If we do this, we are saying at some fundamental level: who we are threatens the security and safety of our relationship. And that is indicative of a relationship not big enough to hold the entirety of who you are as a person and a good indicator that you may be better off reevaluating its worthiness.)

180,"It was a very, very close friend, and while I had originally said yes, I knew I had to go back on my agreement as it became more and more evident how emotionally abusive and manipulative her fiance was. They had planned for it to be a long, several year engagement and she had barely started to plan the wedding and hadn't even set a date, so it wasn't as if I left her hanging at the last minute.

I just told her that I loved her and would absolutely attend, but that I did not think her relationship was healthy or good for her (and she was aware of my much less tactfully put opinion on her SO) and I could not support it to that extent. Nor would I stand up and give a speech, lying to everyone in attendance about what their relationship truly was or how I felt about it.

She was sad but completely understood, and luckily the whole relationship was called off not too long after that. Years later now, we're still very close friends and she's living a much happier, healthier life and taking some time being single."
181,"Dude, you physically ghosted him IRL. I think that is a perfectly adequate response. "
182,When you wake up one day realizing you hate everything including yourself. Life is too short. Biggest thing was letting go of other people’s expectations and opinions of me.
183,"Ouch. That's so sad. It kinda sounds to me like he completely chickened out. In this age of internet romance, it's easy to build up so many expectations of someone, and it's very safe to say romantic or even erotic things online because, well, you don't actually have to interact with a physical person. Do you know that feeling when you meet someone for the first time (perhaps for a date) and you just instantly know that, nope, this is not going to work out? Maybe that happened to him, seeing the difference between you through a computer and you irl... It might have had nothing to do with you looking ""fatter"". You probably looked just fine and he was just too much of a coward to have an honest conversation with you. Whatever it was, it wasn't fair to you and I can totally relate to feeling salty about it :("
184,My insane friend had to decline for the same reason but she showed up as a guest about a week after giving birth. I kept telling her not to come and to relax but she and her husband came and had a great time. 
185,What the actual fuck...?
186,"Yeah, of course. It’s not his fault I misread his signals,  and I can see why he would want to come out to me with his friends around for support in case I turned out to be rabidly homophobic. It was embarrassing but rejection is a normal part of dating. "
187,"I was asked by a semi-close friend whose relationship with her fiancé was.... iffy at best. The wedding was during summer, and I had previously committed to a leadership position at a summer program 8 hours away. I could’ve done it, but it would have required approval from several higher ups in the program. 

Anyway, I had said yes, but then she and her fiancé got in a fight and she said she needed space to think, and he showed up at her house in the middle of the night several times, knocking on her door, begging to see her, kind of losing his mind. They both had a lot of baggage and he had many red flags showing potential of emotional and physical abuse. They shouldn’t have gotten married. They pushed the wedding back, but I told her I couldn’t support their marriage (it was sad and I felt awful) but she understood. They got married anyway, and got divorced a few years later. I found out later that he in fact had been abusive before they got married and it only intensified after marriage. :(  

We’re still friends and I love her dearly and wish the best for her."
188,"Not the person you asked but my boyfriend did the teasing/talking down/pinching tickling shit for a long time. I tried talking to him nicely many times- but it wasn’t until I saw a post on reddit saying “you’re his girlfriend, not his sister don’t put up with it”. 

Anyway, after a particularly painful pinch I got up and told him if it doesn’t stop, we’re done and went to my parents house for the night. And I told him I’m not his sister so he can’t pick on me like that. 

Lo and behold, pinching and tickling has stopped and so has the majority of the teasing. We’re still working on that, but I’m optimistic because he actually changed. I just don’t think he was taking me seriously until I did that. "
189,"One ex told me he was done now and just wanted to see what it was like dating a black woman.
My last ex was a weird rollercoaster. He was heavily Christian (outspoken and pretty haughty about it too) and it came out that he told me he has a sex addiction, then said he was getting therapy for it, then said he had been on fetish sites sending messages and pictures to girls in other states for the duration of our time together (3 years). After all that...no. Just no. Then almost a year later homie is seen at local fetish events. So guess therapy is going great.

On my books for the oddest breakup I've had and I'm nearing 30."
190,"Last year I left a bad workplace. I was there for 8.5 years and it drained me of energy &amp; confidence so badly I could neither find the time/motivation to apply for jobs, nor appreciate how much I had to offer as an employee. Bad workplaces make you feel as though you can’t get a job elsewhere because you’re ‘not good enough’. 

I had a little epiphany about my mental health generally and decided to stop saying ‘no I can’t because...’ about almost everything. To take some chances. 

Weirdly, the thing that started me off was finally agreeing to go bouldering with my husband after months of him pestering. I was sure I wouldn’t like it. 

I was still tired and stressed from work but each time I took a little risk at the bouldering wall it proved to me that I could achieve things I assumed weren’t possible. And I mean a little risk. Like reaching one hold further than I thought I could. The feeling of achievement was such a buzz! It showed me that if I try then at least there’s a chance things can go right. 

A few weeks later a work friend sent me a job advert he thought I would like. My old reflex reaction was, I’m not qualified because half the job is something I’ve never done before. But then I thought - why not use it as a practice (I find interviews terrifying). 

So I did my first external job application in years. It was a pain in the arse, boring and I spent plenty of time whingeing about how hard it all was cos I’m a big moany baby. Totally assumed it was going to be the first of many. But I got an interview (my first non scary one in my life), and I got the job! 

Now I’m so much happier in my new job, with lovely colleagues who take care of each other and treat you as a human being whose job is secondary to their home life. Not being stressed all the time is giving me space to keep working on my mental health and actually have some fun. The lower hours, reduced commute and much better salary are a big bonus. This has totally changed my life. 

10/10 would recommend anyone stuck in a job they hate to ignore their anxious thoughts and just take the first step. You will surprise yourself.


"
191,"I don’t think this is true for everyone. I made a deal like this with a friend of mine because we work well together and he’d make a good father, but I’m certainly not into him. Although our deal is maybe not that serious, just something we say when our love life is in the gutters"
192,"Antidepressants. I’m bipolar and I need those meds to function. And also quitting drugs. My husband and I had great sex when I was high but after I quit it just wasn’t the same. 

Hubby is willing to roll with it because being sane and sober is more important. I feel awful about it and am trying but the libido is gone. "
193,"‘One Day’, 2 best friends through 20 years of their life. It starts in their early twenties (in 1980) and goes right up to their early 40’s, I’ve read it so many times at different ages and I can genuinely relate to them a few times. They meet through a failed hookup and decide to keep in contact. They have all the awkward phases, and honestly it just reminds me that I’m doing well, if they had the awkward horrible stuff and eventually ended up in the right place, then I probably can too."
194,"I caught my long term boyfriend cheating with several other women, one being my best friend. He then proposed to me and told me that if I’d marry him he would stop cheating. That was the easiest decision of my life. "
195,"I almost didn't post this wall of text, but now I'm glad I did! "
196,Even imagining someone doing a choreographed dance at T-9 days pregnant is hilarious. 
197,"I’m all for it! And tbh, I’m happier when my kid isn’t invited to events like that; it gives me a break! Some people like to get upset about children not being invited, but we all have to take a step back, realize it’s the bride and groom’s day (no one else’s), and honor their wishes. If not inviting children means you can’t attend, then don’t attend. But don’t guilt trip the betrothed couple on what is *their* day."
198,"This. My current boyfriend and I moved pretty fast, but it really worked for us and built a really good foundation together. If I moved at this speed with any of my exes I don't think it would have worked in the same way. 

I think moving too fast isn't about a specific timeline, but rather how it makes you feel. When my boyfriend and I traded ""I love you""s, it felt right and it felt natural even though it was fast. "
199,"Can confirm, moved 8000 km to be with a guy I had known for six months, two of them long distance. Did not work out well AT ALL.

Or maybe a little, because I am still here and I love Calgary :)"
200,"I know! She’s such a sweetheart too, it really surprised me. "
201,"My guy friend and I made a pact 2 years ago that we would marry each other if we're not married by the age of 35. Currently im 24 and he's 25...we have known each other for 11 years now. I definetly would say we would make a great couple because we have the most fun together, super spontaneous, if there's ever an argument between us it never escalates we're great at communicating, and we have the same beliefs.  Also I know for a fact he would be a great husband/ father/ partner. Although, the couple thing could work out idk if I could ever see him romantically. The marriage would defintely be platonic and i'm not realizing time goes by super fast lol. Kind of now want to add an extra 5 years to the pact. "
202,At the time I was still only using my wheelchair about 50% (even now most days I can shuffle to the bathroom on my own.  But any further I need to be propped up by someone or in my chair.  At that point  most days I could even do some shopping and not always in my chair depending on how I was doing that day).  I'm sure it just didn't occur to her it would be an issue. I dont think she meant it intentionally  as a problem.  It just hadn't yet crossed her brain why her dream location might not be accessible to everyone she wanted there.  She's not the only bride I've known to pick a venue first before considering if it is appropriate for the guests being invited.
203,This is fucking beautiful. Wish you both continued happiness
204,After 22 years if marriage he said he didn't want to be married anymore.   What that translated to was I am f*cking your friend. 
205,"I know my situation was an absolute dead end so I can't say for sure what I'd do in yours...but at the same time I want to encourage you to feel you have other options because no one should feel stuck in a relationship that's not fulfilling. 

I'm now engaged to a man who gives me all the attention and affection I need and more and honestly I didn't think he could exist, but he does. "
206,"To greet each other, we'll often hug and pat each other down going ""is this still here?"", ""yep, left that there"", ""oh, this is new but I like it"" and so on. We find that absolutely bloody hilarious. 

We also just *love* pretending we don't know each other in public and will outrageously flirt whilst the other protests. It's been particularly funny to us since I've been visibly pregnant. 

Also, when he sneezes I sing him a German birthday song about how nice it is that he was born and that I'd have missed him very much if he hadn't been. It's a fucking riot."
207,"I think it was freeman year in HS. I'd just spent the summer in Switzerland where I'd had the most amazing summer romance with this gorgeous Swiss boy named Bastien. That was rhe boost I needed to think I might finally be popular and get attention from cute boys at home.

There was a boy Jacen I'd had a crush on forever so I just talked to him one day. He was distant but I kept trying. Then I guess he got sick of me and he had two of his friends found my at my gymnastics gym of all places and as I was sweaty, exhausted from practice and wearing a Leo (which alwsys made me feel a little conspicuous) and they said something like ""just so you know, Jacen will never be interested in a girl with small tits and a retard for a brother"" and then laughed as they walked away. My brother has extreme autism so I'd heard cruel comments before but it just crushed me. 

Jacen actually saw me at college 5-6 years later and apologized. I guess he felt bad over it for years."
208,"Thank you for asking this question, OP. It has helped me answer a lot of questions I had been contemplating for the past few years! "
209,That’s abusive behavior. It really is; can you begin to extricate yourself? What he is doing is 100% not ok physically and emotionally. He’s hurting you &amp; then invalidating your experience &amp; reality &amp; then making you feel shame &amp; guilt for your very valid response. 
210,I literally can’t ever study early. Ever. 
211,This is way more frivolous than most responses but... I had gained some weight over the course of a year due to school and stress and wasn’t feeling good about myself even though my boyfriend said I looked good. At the end of the year before summer (I live in Aus) I spent two months eating clean and working out and was able to lose 10kg - the weight I had originally put on and then some. I was super happy and finally feeling good about my body again and our sex life has never been better :) 
212,"""It hurts knowing he doesn't feel the same way about me as I do him."" 

This hit closer to home than I'd like to admit. "
213,"I have no idea. I didnt have horrible cramping, just some lower back pain on day 1 that went away with motrin. And some serious hyperactivity. People thought I bled coffee.

Of course now I'm not on that birth control anymore so I have no back pain but I have cramps. "
214,"This gives me hope. I went from being sex-crazed for the last 5 years to no desire whatsoever. I asked my doctor and she said “well, the thing about sex is that the more you have it, the more you want it!! So just do it more!!” Like listen lady, I DONT WANT TO HAVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! Seeing a new doctor later this month; gonna try again for real help. "
215,"I was 20 min in, on a first date with a guy off Craigslist. I asked about the most beautiful place he'd ever been? Guy tells a quick story about the location, looks into my eyes, and says ""I'll take you there."" Of course ""desperate internet weirdo"" goes through my mind. 

👉🏼 I'm sititing here, 12 yrs later, with our 8 month old daughter. We've remodeled 4 homes together; the first one I found on Craigslist haha. He founded a biotech a few years ago. We also raised his sons and many fur-children.

"
216,"I had a similar thing! It was some guy in 7th grade asked me out, and I said “no”



For the next few days his friends kept coming up to me and saying how upset he was so finally I said I would date him.



Then a few days later I told him I would date him, he looks around and goes “hey it worked” and they all laughed at me because I guess it was a big joke.



Looking back at it (like even a few months later) I realized that he did that to make himself feel better. It’s like when a guy flirts with you, you reject him, then he tells his friends you’re ugly. Like obvi you didn’t think that when you initially flirted with me."
217,"&gt; I was depressed and living on the sofas of friends 

You did make the right choice. You might regret it now, but the reality is, at that time you made a *huge* sacrifice to do what you believed was the best for you child. 

You made a hard choice that so many parents refuse to make, and you chose your child’s best choice instead of yours. That is, without a doubt, exactly what a great parent does for their child. 

I don’t know how she is now, but there’s no guarantee that if she had continued with you it would’ve been better and you might’ve been telling this post from the opposite side, instead wishing you had let her go. 

I’m not trying to dismiss your regret, because I don’t know the whole story, but perspective matters. You did the best you could with what knowledge you had, and that’s really all anyone can expect of you. "
218,"Chuckled at the “if it helps, she is a woman at least?” part. Such a cute story! I wish I had one haha "
219,"I wish that I had done this. I was just MOH for my little sister and it felt bad every step of the way. It should have been her best friend. It was so consuming and exorbitantly expensive and the whole time I felt unwanted, like she only asked me because she thought she should, I kept asking myself “why am I doing this?” All the while I was juggling a lot in my personal life as well. Lesson learned. "
220,So not quite how it went... buuut I had a friend where we promised to marry each other if we hadn't found someone by the time he hit the age 40. He is now my husband and I think it has worked out really well even if we ended up marrying about 2 years earlier than planned. We had ended up deciding to date and things just turned out amazingly.
221,"I gave custody of my child to her father when she was ten years old.  
My life was in shambles- I had just been widowed, I was depressed and living on the sofas of friends and truly felt the stable home and family life he could provide would be better for her.    
I wish like hell I had held on and stuck it out.   
But there're are no do-overs in life."
222,"Yup. One of those things at the time that was like ""ouch"" but also definitely fit the character of the guy. Now it's a hilarious anecdote!"
223,"I've been on both sides of a wedding party rejection. 

I couldn't be maid of honor for my very best friend years ago. In fact, I couldn't even attend the wedding. 

I had just started graduate school 700 miles away from home (where she lived) in Sept when she met a guy in Oct. Called me in Dec asking if I would stand up with her in Jan before this guy (who was like 4 years younger than her) went back to college.

I was like, ""Honey are you sure about this? It's really fast! Why not wait until summer when you've had more time to plan (AND ALSO MAKE SURE THIS WHIRLWIND WILL STICK?!)? And also I've just been cast as a lead in the school of music's biggest opera production of the year and the weekend you picked is a performance that I literally cannot miss or I will fail the class.""

She didn't change her mind and I couldn't get out of my school obligation. Hell, my GRANDMOTHER died the week before the production and my mom postponed the funeral until I finished the show &amp; could fly home to attend. 

But after a cooling off period, we've remained friends. And she's still married, 10 years &amp; 3 kids later, happy as a clam.

A few years later, I asked my S.I.L. to be my matron of honor at my wedding b/c she'd been the one to encourage me to try eHarmony when I moved to a big city &amp; knew NO ONE. So I met my husband on there &amp; he proposed at my bro &amp; SIL's house on Thanksgiving, so she's been central to this relationship, right? She accepted, but then a couple months later, as (now)Hubs was struggling with some severe depression &amp; anxiety (getting help through meds &amp; counseling), she was my outlet for frustration &amp; fear, but accidentally let slip what was happening to my bro. And he up &amp; calls me &amp; says he will not nor will any of his family support or attend our wedding b/c of Hubs' depression/anxiety. Not ""hey do you think you should postpone,"" no ""what can we do to help"", just jerked any support out from under us.

EVEN MY PARENTS, who I was terrified to tell b/c I thought they'd tell me to leave Hubs, were incredibly understanding &amp; supportive. My dad, a Vietnam vet and as crusty &amp; conservative as they come, shared that a good buddy of his still struggled with suicidal thoughts after what he went through in 'Nam. I was gobsmacked.

So SIL wound up not being my MOH, but another friend. Her daughter, my niece, WAS my flower girl &amp; bro &amp; SIL attended the wedding. But I've never shared major life milestones with them again. They don't deserve it. v.v

EDIT TO CLARIFY: This episode was months before our wedding, with plenty of time for Hubs to continue getting better. We've been married for 6 years and he literally says every other day, ""I'm so glad I married you."" He will always have depressive and anxious tendencies, but he's putting in the work necessary to cope with them in a healthy way. And I'm very glad that I married him. A couple years after we married, I was diagnosed with an incurable chronic condition. There's no one else I know who immediately understood the ramifications of that better than him, or has been more patient and understanding. So as frustrating as living with his depression/anxiety can be sometimes, the way he loves me FAR outweighs any negatives. I am so glad I didn't listen to my brother.

HOWEVER, this is not a blanket endorsement for sticking with a depressed partner who cannot or will not get help. They have to invest in their own well being before they can be a good partner to you. For some couples, that means going separate ways is the best option for both people."
224,"I mean, I can't argue with that kind of hard science."
225,"God damn, that's sad man."
226,"When I was about 17, I went to the park on a ""double date"" with a good friend of mine and two guys we just met. We'd been there for about 10 minutes when dude #1 suddenly shouts, ""I'll bet you $10 I can run through those trees and back in 60 seconds!"" And he just takes off into the forest. After a few minutes, dude #2 decides his friend ""must've gotten lost"", runs to his car, and drives away. We never saw or heard from either dude again. It was a very strange experience because these guys presued **us** and we're still not sure what made them run for the hills after spending just 10 minutes alone with us."
227,"On the opposite side, I had 3 kids in my 20s. Got breast cancer at age 32. (13 years later and all’s well.) this has the side effect of removing my fertility. I was glad to have the family I wanted young because that was my one shot in retrospect. I was a stay at home mom and am now in the workforce, without needing to take a break to have kids. It’s not a bad way to go.  "
228,"I haven’t ever declined: was a bridesmaid 6 times - I did the math for fun one day and realized I’ve spent about 5 figures on my friends weddings. Pretty much what I spent on my own wedding! 

That said, I’ve been at weddings where the bridesmaid/MOH should have declined as you could see the relationship with the bride had deteriorated throughout the process of wedding planning. They gritted their teeth and went through the wedding, but they didn’t do a toast for the “happy couple” and they stopped speaking to each other immediately after the wedding. It’s so sad how weddings can completely ruin friendships! "
229,"Honestly, it was just absurd enough that I kind of laughed it off and didn't take it personally. "
230,Your *not very flattering photo* was not the reason he ghosted you. He was probably going to ghost you anyway. It’s not you and not because of a photo. 
231,"With my ex when it died it was from resentment. 

He had been cruel to me and hurt my feelings to the point I was no longer interesting in fucking. 

It went on for months and eventually he cheated on me and we broke up. 

He never did accept what I was saying and never did change the way he treated me, so I suppose he was consciously destroying things. "
232,"hey you never know about future kids, my aunt had her first at 38 and then her second at 41."
233,Not using university as a networking opportunity. Or even realizing how important networking like this was until much later.
234,"I did it with my friend... if by 40 we both remain free we would marry...   He is  engaged already... so   I guess it won't happen... I still have 10 years  :P

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  this can be my opportunity to move to Barcelona  :') "
235,Well that’s absolutely terrifying
236,"Did you have a movie-like scene where you changed the way you look moving from a 5 to 11  just to spite him, and now you're playing the long game?

jk of course, nice for you guys."
237,If you haven't seen the movie 8th grade it's worth a watch.  Really a reminder of how hard it is.
238,"He would openly tell friends in front of me that we'd done the deed. If things had been a quiet on the sex front every one would be told that too.
I  edited down the bits I would prefer my kids didn't see. They know I have an account.
Was a bit fried, did not expect so much attention.
Head injuries from work and sport. Not easy.
"
239,"Having other men touching him, without permission, in inappropriate areas in public places. I also think the level of respect given him by strangers might diminish somewhat. "
240,These guys couple 
241,"Oh, though as an 11 year old, I was 'asked out' on camp by a boy I liked and I was nervous to hold his hand. He 'broke up' with me literally 20 minutes later because I was nervous. "
242,A few years ago I ended a friendship with someone I was close to. She was so negative and toxic that I would feel incredibly unhappy after spending time with her. This went on for a long time and it took me a while to realize the impact it was having on my life. I talked to her about it a few times before ending the friendship in hopes that things would improve but they never did.
243,"I kinda like my freckles, even though people said I gained one for each guy I slept with. Joke's on them: their souls are mine now."
244,"Wear a tampon.  Or prevent yourself from getting periods through birth control or IUDs.  Or, if you're an elite athlete with more intense training and physical requirements, you may naturally stop getting your period altogether.

But for real--wearing a tampon isn't going to prevent you from performing."
245,"Grooming in general. If you have a monobrow, pluck it. If you grow long hair, you need to care for it, you can't just stop cutting it and hope for the best. Trim your beard. Moisturize your scaly skin. Deal with your callouses. Trim and clean your nails. Buy clothes that fit you and suit your body type. Wear lip balm if they're getting chapped (seriously so many men seem to have an issue with this.)

It won't make you gay or a woman. It will make you *more attractive.* I am not saying to go over the top styling yourself, just look after yourself! So many dudes refuse to.

And a lot of dudes get all ""but I don't know howww toooo."" Well, I wasn't born with this knowledge either. I figured it out. You can too."
246,"I'm a SAHM with no support network. My son's therapy is expensive; I've looked into programs others have mentioned for it but it doesn't cover co-pays as far as I've gotten. It's hundreds in copays a month. 

I'm thinking about leaving in 5 years. Therapy should be scaled back, both kids in school, so fewer concerns about daycare costs. I also need to get back to some kind of retraining in the meantime. I don't even know where to begin to get a career to support the three of us. I've thought about medical billing, but I don't even know anymore. 

I am unhappy. Everything's a mess. I'm keeping things together for my kids, they're doing ok, but everything else...

"
247,"Thank you. Honestly, it couldn't have gone down better, because he was stalking me, I had moved to another state and he even followed me. I knew if I called the cops after one of his simple assaults on me, he would just spend the night in jail and then come back and hurt me. He was charged with assault family violence via strangulation but I truly believe that it was the assault on a police officer and attempt to take a weapon from an officer charges that put him away and out of my life for 4 years. "
248,"Same with my step-sister's wedding. Im an immigrant here in the US and while I was starting to shop around for cheap airfare (wedding was in home country in Asia), the travel ban and other immigration issues came up and my husband did not feel comfortable about me and my daughter leaving the country. So we had to miss her wedding (she already bought our dresses) and she had to find a new bridesmaid and flower girl. She was so understanding about everything and didn't blame me at all for missing her wedding. I still get so emotional when I think about it. I feel sad, mad, regret and guilt about the whole thing. "
249,"I can only comment on 20s, as I'm about to turn 30:

While your parents brought you into this world and taught you your bad habits and are probably the root cause of your mental health problems; it's your job now to take responsibility of how you deal with it. You can't live a healthy and fulfilling life believing they owe you something. You don't owe them anything either. Move on or stay down, either way your problems are not theirs to fix anymore.

250,It has more to do with body fat %.  I believe estrogen is either made in or supported by body fat and if you don’t have enough your estrogen levels aren’t high enough to allow for mestration. 
251,"When I was 18 I was pregnant with a man I was for like 6 month. It was of course an accident and I figured out when I moved out, so he wasn't in the same city as me. He was at 2 hours from me. I was alone and very afraid, I didn't tell anyone except him because I was so ashamed. I decided to have an abortion and I asked him to come to support me. 
He said he'll come and each Friday before the we he found an excuse like 'oh there is a party I have to go I can't come'. Or also he said it was too hard for him to see me and see his ""child"" die. But it was very hard for ME, and I wanted to have a child but not as young as I was. So I did it alone and I've never seen him again. Very hard period of my life."
252,"I once went on a single date with a guy before he started venting to me about his crazy ex trashing his house and trying to set it on fire, and telling me he had to be strong 'for us.' Noped out of that ASAP"
253,"My best friend and i did this when i was 18 and he was 21, in 10 years if we weren't with anyone. I'm 26 now. we dated for a year after that and it didn't quite work out. after some time away from each other we were able to be friends again and every once an awhile one of us will be like ""we've got x amount of years until that pact comes up huh?"" we live in different states but i think we both think about it more frequently than we'd like to admit. I think i would still go through with it if we lived closer and got to spend more time with each other."
254,Watch tv that he doesn’t like and go to bed early and sleep diagonally 
255,"&gt; or how if he waits to 40 to have children as I did, that it’s unlikely his child/children will know their grandparents.

Hey. I'm a man visiting from /r/all but i'm in your son's shoes. My parents had me at 40. I'm 30 now. They're 70. They're doing well, but I worry for them, and not just for their own sake. I'm getting married next year. I hope to have children in the next 5 years. My parents will see my wedding. If life goes anything like the way I hope, they'll know my children. I worry that my children may not remember them. I love them so much, and I want my children to know what wonderful people they are. To have the benefit of their deep wisdom before they get stuck with my haphazard collection of witticisms.

But at the same time... all of us are who we are because of the lives we have lived. I wouldn't be me if i were born 10 years earlier. More importantly to me, I wouldn't have met my fiancee. The love of my life, my soulmate. Even if I had, we'd be 15 years apart, and I'd be someone else. We likely never would have connected.

I guess I'm just saying that while yes, waiting has some very big negatives... so does not waiting. You lose your 20s and 30s to child-rearing. It consumes your life. You're a different person. Your children are different people from who they could be.

You regret not having children 10 years sooner. That's okay. You're entitled to regrets. But... but I'd forgive my parents in a heartbeat if they thought they wronged me by waiting. I don't think they need forgiveness from anyone, though. I hope they don't regret waiting. I just want them to be happy."
256,How did he change? 
257,"Mental illness, in a way. I know I am an asshole but I did it to protect my mental health. This happened last week. 

She is psychotic, and one of her fixations is that my relationship with my boyfriend isn't real. It *can't* be real, because it doesn't make any sense, because no-one in their right mind would date me.  I heard so much frankly cruel stuff that went straight into my insecurities, that... well. I called her brother, and then got in contact with her father. She apparently seems unbalanced, but has been behaving almost normally around them. To be clear, she said a lot of things that were really out there, paranoid and crazy. This me and boyfriend-thing was pretty lame considering, but like I said, cruel. 

So I know she needs help, and I have done my best to alert her family. But I can't be friends with her anymore, I'm just not able to deal with that.
"
258,"If she’s married to him, and he doesn’t have kids, she doesn’t need a will. She’d get everything. Sounds like she wants him to write a will so she *isn’t* left in the unfortunate position of getting a wife’s inheritance when he might actually want his money to go elsewhere."
259,I am having my first child at 38 and my girlfriend is 36.... I couldn't agree more with you know being mature enough to know ourselves and also old enough that the bar star days are over (and happy they are). We are both financial independently stable so together it is just much easier. I feel I am patent enough now to be able to be a good parent. Me in my 20s was a mess. My later 30s is finally stable. 
260,"A friend of my husbands asked me. We were fairly  close at the time but had very different views on how a wedding should be. She had a huge budget at a pricy black tie venue and I knew she was wanting designer bridesmaids dresses plus all the other extras. I also knew her other bridesmaids had a lot of drama among them. I was getting ready for PA school at the time and had a lot on my plate, plus I was trying to save $$ since I wouldn’t be working for 2+ years. I was basically honest and sent her a nice long email saying I thought I bridesmaid should be able to commit to providing the best experience for the bride and be “all in.” I told her at this point in my life I wouldn’t be able to provide that for her both financially and time wise and that I had to trim down all my commitments. I told her I loved her and I’d be there for her on the big day with bells on. She took it really well. She just asked that I didn’t mention it to her second choice bridesmaid. I still kinda cringe when I think that I said no to someone but I still think it was the right decision. It hasn’t impacted our friendship. I think in general honesty is the best policy. Also had a bridesmaid of mine back out last minute for pregnancy reasons and I had 0 hard feelings toward her."
261,Thanks for sharing your story.  My sex drive returned after my divorce too! I wish more women and men realize that their low “sex drive” may just be with their one spouse/partner and not low overall.
262,It's a good idea.  Most weddings are pretty booze heavy and why would you want a bunch of kids around when there's people planning on time traveling?

266,"I kind of had a similar situation, maybe the opposite side of it. We were roommates and they totally disrespected my personal space and items. When I brought that up, I was being crazy and immature.  So I stopped bringing things up, and then they said I was angry all the time. It didn’t help that a person who reached out to me and said I could talk to her about the situation was telling them the things I was said to her while venting. That part hurt the most."
267,"Earplugs,  medication,  sleep in the other room. I also fantasize about murdering him in his sleep and pleading insanity due to snoring, but with my luck my cell mate will snore too. "
268,That fuckin neg blew up in his face. 
269,"First and only child at 40. Two big regrets, 1) we are too tired to have another one (lack of sleep the first several years is rough!), 2) I constantly think of how I will be 60 when he’s 20, or how if he waits to 40 to have children as I did, that it’s unlikely his child/children will know their grandparents. I regret not doing this 10 years ago."
270,"I started with my local Toastmasters club and then I just jumped into it. It can be super scary but it helps to start with small groups in a safe setting like a classroom or a club. You have to keep the momentum up. Any time you get a chance to speak in front of others, do it. Even if you're scared, even if you're nervous. I've competed in public speaking while sick and still managed to place.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the tips I've found helpful in developing my skills and confidence:

&amp;#x200B;

1) **Speak slowly.**  I speak really fast when I'm nervous, and my words get lost. So I had to make an effort to speak slowly and patiently, as if I'm trying to talk someone through a recipe. 

2) **Don't fill silences.** It's just as important to be quiet as it is to speak. We have a tendency to say 'ah' or 'um' when we don't know what to say as a way to fill the silence. Don't say anything, and take a pause to think. You'll appear more confident when you do that.

3) **Rehearse what you want to say.** But don't write out a whole speech. Get down the rough outline of what you want to say, and then just repeat those points to yourself while you're making dinner or cleaning up. It comes across as more natural, and you don't rely so heavily on notes.

274,Did you stay friends after? 
275,"She hated my best friend. It was mutual because my bff didn't like her either. I split my time between them but my friend would piss and moan if I couldn't do something because I already had plans with my bff. It got old fast. The breaking point came when she demanded I choose between them. She didn't want me to be friends with her at all. I asked if she was sure she wanted me to choose and she said yes, so I chose. The difference between them was how they handled it. My bff was sad that I had to choose and she felt bad that it cost me a friend. The other one talked shit behind my back and told everyone that I just dumped her for no reason. 24 years later and my bff is still my bff. I made the right choice. "
276,"was in love with someone and i sent him nudes because he asked me to. but the last one i sent, looking back, was not very flattering, so from then on he ghosted me. it really broke my heart like i really thought we could pursue a relationship and i showed him the most intimate parts of me"
277,"I’m supposed to be her maid of honor. (Or matron i suppose since I’m married). But she decided to elope instead but said i should come to the chapel. I had just had a baby the week before so I declined. She understood because we’re friends and we’re still friends now (and talk daily). 

I consider her a sister so it hurt not to be able to attend, she was my maid of honor. I wish she would have waited to get married for many reasons but understand her choice and respect it. "
278,"This here is a good friend. A friend of mine far more well off asked me to be her bridesmaid, and when my flush of excitement turned to embarrassment because i didn't think i could afford anything really (I am on disability...), she stopped me and told me she would get it. That she never had expected me to. I was so glad... I don't have a lot of close friends, and while I am not the super girly type, being a trans woman something like this just feels crazy affirming...  


Assuming all goes well it will be in a year-ish, can't wait!"
279,So the moral of the story was don’t listen to you?
280,You've got the dad joke down pat
281,"Shocker, no. It was such a sad situation. I understand that he divorced her for someone else and was extremely abusive to her. She moved in with some extended family, her immediate family wouldn’t take her back home. 

I lost touch with her, as did some mutual friends. I really hope she’s doing well. Her family sucked BIG time. "
282,"I think she means that athletes who have highly rigorous training programs and very low bodyfat will actually stop menstruating. This is a common thing among female athletes (more pronounced in sports where low bodyweight/fat tend to be more extreme, such as ballet and gymnastics), and it's not because they're so healthy and fit, it's because their bodies are so stressed. "
283,"“You’re not the kind of girl I want to date. Being around you is emotionally exhausting. You just radiate negative energy.”

I was 23. To be fair, I was really depressed at the time, but geez, dude.

**ETA:** Is this post NOT about “What’s the WORST way you’ve been rejected?”? I’m not saying this guy was wrong to feel the way he did; I WAS hard to be around sometimes, and I was seeking help via therapy twice a week and meds (still am; I have chronic depression). I wasn’t treating him like my therapist. I’m open about my feelings with people; I don’t expect anyone to fix them though. I do feel that he could have been a little kinder in his wording instead of making me feel like a defective, awful person. I, too, am very honest with people, but I don’t say things in such a way that is so incredibly hurtful."

286,"My dad had my older sister at 50 and me at 52. He was 67 and I was 15 when I found him face down, dead in our bathroom. 

I also plan on having kids at an older age but don’t underestimate the impact it may have on your future children. His dead body still flashes in my mind "
287,"Honestly short of maaaaybe &lt;$20 thrift store type clothes, I think the bride should pay for it. The only purpose of bridesmaid dresses are as decoration for the wedding, and 90% of the time they never wear the dress again. It would be like asking guests to pay for the table they eat dinner on. I have never understood the idea of making other people buy clothes for the sole purpose of matching your wedding aesthetic. And even if the other person does take it home and use it again, it’s no different than offering for people to take home centerpieces - it’s a gift for coming and helping out with the wedding, not a transaction. (At least, I hope nobody is asking for people to pay for the centerpieces!)

I know this isn’t the tradition (and it’s why we didn’t have a bridal party at our wedding), but I just don’t get the idea of making someone spend their own money on something like that. Inevitably they are already spending money on your wedding through other means (travel, accommodations, taking time off work, gift, etc.) and I don’t really understand why anyone would want to make that worse.

We’ve traveled, eaten out, partied, and spent money on stupid things. I don’t feel like we’re not missing out now. It’s nice to stay home and be a family. We’ll still do all those things again, just less right now, and that’s fine. "

I would have called her an acquaintance, but still just a random coworker. A few weeks later she told us she was engaged,  and then turned to me and asked me to be her maid of honor. I said yes out of sheer panic and surprise. I actually had to ask a friend of mine what her name was and to double check that she had meant to ask me and hadn't mistaken me for someone else. 

I stopped working there, and never saw her again,  sooo..."
295,"30s: your bad habits and carelessness come home to roost in your late twenties into thirties. Never wore sunscreen? Now you start seeing the little lines and spots from that. Smoked since you were 16? Now you really start to feel it. Hangovers are worse. Weight is harder to lose, and exercise injuries take longer to heal. It's natural and normal, but I would still tell anyone to be a little kinder to their body whenever they can. 

At least for some of us sex gets better in your thirties though. So that cuts the bitterness a bit."

297,"I’m also a survivor of sexual assault. I wouldn’t say we have a DB, but we probably have sex 2-3 times a month.

It is better than it used to be thanks to therapy, but I don’t think it will ever be normal. "
298,"nothing.  the wrestling i had to do to come to terms with my singleness was an important part of my character development.  if i knew ""you'll meet someone, don't worry"" i wouldn't have invested so heavily in myself and maybe not really have become the right woman for him. "
299,"&gt;I freeze up every time he hugs me or anything close because I’m afraid he will hurt me.

302,"I’ve done Long’s Peak several times, and even for someone in decent hiking shape like myself, that’s a HARD hike. There’s even a sign once you get to the boulderfield that says it’s NOT a hike, it’s a climb. It’s dangerous too, one person this past summer alone confirmed dead, another still “missing” (aka dead) and they rescued another missing girl who luckily made it with minimal injuries. I can’t imagine trying to have a wedding up there, and honestly, 3am is a LATE start, especially if you’re out of shape and trying to have a ceremony at the top! There’s no way they made it to the top for sunrise. It takes me 10 hours minimum to do the whole hike, when I was in peak shape I was able to do it in 9. A leisurely pace for a fit person is easily 12-14 hours. That bride was absolutely crazy. "
303,"OMG that is horrible! What a little shithead.

My most embarrassing rejection was at 11 too. Middle school dance. I asked my crush to dance and he said ""I only dance with girls, not dogs."" All his friends laughed and they nicknamed me Fido for the rest of the school year. 

Jokes on them. I blossomed in high school and that jerk twice to ask me out. It felt good to tell him absolutely not both times. "
304,"I agree in terms of what behaviour is acceptable for a girl and a boy to exhibit. Girls are typically raised to be obedient, to be helpers, to mind their manners and play quietly, whilst boys are raised with a lot more freedom but less emotional support, which can lead to them being seen as less mature than girls. 

My goddaughter's sister who's a little brawler, and loves playing football and dirt and maths and wants her hair cut short is such an aberration in her school that her teachers have raised concerns about her gender expression when she's perfectly happy being a girl, just not the kind that's expected. 

However, girls' brains [noticeably streamline and mature faster](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/25/6/1477/299218) than boys', so some of it is biological reality as well. "
305,"I'm a man this happened to. She left because I was too caught up in my own shit to be a good partner to her. Sure, depression is real, people have rough patches, but all I did was dwell and brood. I never fixed anything. All my energy was spent on me, and a good deal of hers was too. She got the scraps. I fucked up, and I paid for it with the best relationship I've ever been in. Don't be like me"

307,"It wasn't a book. It was talking to older friends and having it confirmed again and again that you can do everything ""right"" in terms of adulthood milestones and still end up miserable. It was dating people who married in their 20s because they thought marriage was the endgame of being in a relationship only to end up divorced by 30. It was seeing a friend take out a substantial personal loan so she could buy a condo, then learning she hated the responsibility of home ownership. It was hearing from friends with master's degrees that they have nothing to show for their education but debt, and now in their 40s they have to break into an entirely different field to pay the bills. 

That doesn't mean marriage or buying a house or going to college are bad choices. It just means they aren't guarantees of a happy or prosperous future. It also means that you aren't less of an adult if you take longer to hit certain milestones or eschew some of them entirely. You're doing fine. "
308,"In 5th grade, each day at recess, a whole horde of kids would organize a casual soccer game. I wasn't the best at sports, but not the worst (my parents never signed me up for any sports so this was one of my only chances to play in a big team), and I really wanted to play amongst my schoolmates, it seemed exhilarating.

I was encouraged that a whole bunch of kids were playing, so I worked up the courage to join in the mix as they picked teams. A guy and a girl were the captains, and began choosing teams.

They kept picking everyone else, until finally I was the only one left. Then the guy captain proclaimed ""I guess we will take the leftovers"" and everyone laughed at me. I mumbled something about not really wanting to play anyways, and ran into the school, to go cry in the bathroom. "

314,"My childhood friend didn’t ask me, so much as she sent me an email with the bridesmaid details since she assumed I’d be one. 

Since she’s not one for direct conflict and would ignore my phone call, I politely responded to her email and let her know I was honored and wished I could participate, but I couldn’t meet the expectations of a bridesmaid and had to bow out. 

My response was the truth. I lived 1500 miles away. Her shower, bachelorette party, and wedding were all more than three weeks apart. She picked out “inexpensive” dresses, but the bridesmaids were expected to buy them. To save money, she asked the bridesmaids to cover their makeup and hair as their wedding gift to her. All in all the total approximate cost to be a bridesmaid was going to be in the neighborhood of $6000, and this wasn’t taking into account I was currently a high risk pregnancy and probably couldn’t travel anyways. 

She extrapolated that I was mad I wasn’t her maid of honor and was doing it to spite her, told everyone as much, and then refused to even acknowledge that I was there when I did show up for her wedding (the invitation was sent out after I declined to be a bridesmaid and the RSVP I sent back was confirmed, so I didn’t realize until I got there that she’d sent the invite as a formality and I wasn’t actually supposed to show up).

I was at a party and I had heard a mutual friend say a few days beforehand that her best friend was her ‘safety wife.’ I was tipsy, and remembered that, so I asked one of my (very platonic) friends if she wanted to be my safety wife. She can be kind of a reticent person and she wasn’t answering fast enough, so I turned to another friend (turned out to be less platonic) and asked her if she wanted to be my safety wife. She said yes right away, and we decided that we would get married at fifty if we were both still single. Joking about our hypothetical future married life led to flirting, which led to us getting together about three weeks later. 

Pro tip: if you’ve made this deal with someone you know, there’s a fair chance that there’s been more than friendship there all along, and perhaps you haven’t realised. This isn’t an absolute law, but a guideline..."
336,"33 when I had our daughter. PROs: 1) Financially stable, 2) had 5 years of marriage under my belt &amp; knew my partner was ready to be a parent, too 3) Emotionally more mature and patient 4) in my 50s now with daughter in college and the teen years “keep me young” as I bond with her over popular culture, music, politics, etc,

CONs: 1) adjusting from full-on career mode to motherhood was a tough transition for me, (but a worthwhile experience IMHO) 2) My daughter will also most likely be an older mother (if at all), making me an ancient grandmother. Ah, well. 3) I’m older than most of her friends parents but by no means the oldest, either. Not necessarily a con since it allowed me to form friendships with folks regardless of age. It’s all how you look at things and remaining open to possibilities. 

The pros far outweighed the cons for me. No regrets. "

She shortly after got a job in another city and was having a small going away dinner and she reached out to me and wanted me to come. ""So you want me to have a small dinner with you, my ex, and 2 other people? After everything? Um no.""

A mutual friend told me she broke up with him shortly after for the same reasons I broke up with him. Go figure. "
338,"I used to date a girl long distance and to be honest I did this too (to her). I talked a big game online but in reality I am super shy and very self conscious about my body. Fortunately she was very persistent and we kept meeting and it ended up being a really good healthy (and EVENTUALLY intamate) relationship that was unfortunately killed by the circumstances of our lives (so much for happily ever after). Probably he is just like most gamer guys and he realized once you were there actually in front of him, that you were the real deal. that probably scared the shit out of him, as it frankly did me. "
339,"If the man asks you to move to his house within one week of dating


If he tells you ""I love you "" too soon..."
340,"He started to act annoyed by my presence. He stopped singing me to sleep, he didn't want to celebrate holidays with me, and what hurt most is he would ignore me when he knew I was having a bad day. I was more of a burden than a girlfriend. The way he loved me at the end (or lack thereof) has affected how I view other men. I hate that its like that now, but when you give someone your whole heart and they crush it, it makes you rethink everything."
341,"I broke up with him for many reasons, but one of them was emotional needs. I felt like he never saw me for *me*. He was never interested in my life, never wanted to hang out or meet my friends, we rarely went out, he wasn't there for me the way I needed through a few tragedies in my life, I could barely hold a conversation with him, etc etc. 

I realized that our personalities weren't compatible, that our life views weren't compatible, and that I outgrew him in the nearly 2 years we were together. He wasn't the one I wanted to tell everything too. If something exciting happened in my life, I didn't think of telling him first because I knew he wouldn't be interested in hearing about it.

I did love him, and I loved his family too. It was hard to break up but I knew I had too because I couldn't be with someone who I couldn't experience life with or someone who didn't think as highly as me as I did them. I felt small and not myself around him by the end of it. 

It was hard getting over him. It was a very rough while after breaking up with him. Whenever I missed him I reminded myself that I missed the familiarity more than him. That I wouldn't be happy with him or myself with him. Slowly I stopped missing him and learned how to be by myself again.

It was 10000% the right decision. I'm now with someone who truly loves me for me. I'm experiencing life with him. He's my favorite person and very best friend. He's the one I want to tell things to first and I know he'll listen. He's as interested in my life as I am his, and we both think very highly of each other. 

Staying with someone who doesn't meet your needs sucks and it does some damage to your self worth. Being with someone who respects you, who is compatible with you, who meets your needs and is someone who you can truly be yourself around is amazing and wonderful.  "

343,Is the first friend still married to that awful man?
344,"Oh the feels. I majored in math, which is amazing - if paired with something it compliments, but I went purest of the pures. The only saving grace is I've always wanted to be a researcher, and then I'd argue a pure math bachelors is probably the singular best degree to become a powerful PHD level researcher... but that means getting a PHD and following all the way through to the academic end.

Really wish I had double majored with CS or stuck with my EE minor."
345,"I had my first child at 38 and the second at 40.  

I love that I’m much more patient, organized, and financially secure than I was in my 20s.  I can calmly deal with tantrums and bickering, keep track of school events and who needs new clothes, and hire help when I need it.  

It would have been harder for me to cope with parenthood in my 20s.  I probably would have traumatized my kids with my depression, anxiety, and selfishness.  By now I’ve more or less fixed those issues so that I can be a kind and creative mom.

The only downside for me is that my body is getting creaky so I can’t run as fast as the kids can!"
346,Is he the friend you’re laughing with
347,:’(
348,"You could save more money if you didn’t support him!!! 

You owe him nothing. He obviously isn’t doing anything to help or support you and you deserve better! Life is difficult but it is important to make choices for yourself that will make YOU most happy. "
349,"Conversely, my mom had my little brother at 43 (she’s 50 now) and her patience is shot. She’s just so over everything way quicker than when she had me in her 20s, and can’t always keep up due to arthritis and menopause starting to kick in. Luckily the little guy has older sisters in their 20s to take him places and do things, but I understand that after a few children and being a bit older is challenging with younger children. "
350,"I turned down my best friend from college.  I did not like her bf.  He was a controlling, jealous, lazy jerk with anger issues.  They had dated since she was 15, he 18.  They were into some pretty heavy partying.


So, this is what made me say no.  When she was 18 she decided it was time to have sex with him.  She told him, and she planned a romantic weekend at her family's cabin.  Yes, she was sneaking this.  But she pulled it off.  Flowers, candles, music, much romance.  It was a big deal to her.  She was Catholic, and felt he was her mate.  

Afterwards he laughed at her.  He told her he had already had sex with her a few times when she had been black out drunk.

She married him anyway, and he is still a lazy drunk with anger issues. My take on this is if your best friend backs out from being your maid of honor because your fiance is a total ass, you might want to reconsider your wedding."
351,"When I was like 11 I used to go to these social dance things with my friends. It wasn’t really my thing, I’ve always been introverted but they insisted I go. I remember my friends pushing me to ask this guy to dance, I didn’t want to and then he asked me, I said okay. After that my friends said it was on a dare and the dude and his friends came over throughout the night to tell me I’m ugly. So yeah, not really a rejection but probably one of the worst things that’s happened to me regarding the opposite sex. "
352,"No. The relationship isn't good, he's using you to pay his bills and fund his lifestyle. He sounds like a shit, and you sound like a pushover. Get your self-respect back, it's in there somewhere, and remember that you are a beautiful, grown-ass adult, and you don't need to listen to his judgmental garbage, especially when you're taking care of him! "
353,"Not OP but I did the same thing, 3 year relationship (abusive), quit the terrible job, but went from Midwest to West Coast. 

The cause for the move was because I was depressed but now I get to be depressed on a beach!"
354,The medication I take to keep me from wanting to kill myself also keeps me from wanting or enjoying sex.
355,"Oh honey. Why are you with this person? You can do so much better. Vaginas have a natural smell that lots of people love. You deserve love, respect, and someone who is excited about you. That person is out there. "
356,"Falling for the Scarcity Bias. Go on dates with multiple people, even if it's just coffee casual. Gives me a clear sense of having alternatives and making a choice."
357,Nope! She couldn’t come either. I didn’t mind. I just tease her about it. I have some anxiety issues w travel so I never judge others for not wanting to travel. 
358,"It doesn't sound like he has time for a relationship, tbh."
359,That’s not even a neg though. Negs are way more subtle and insidious. They can work on even decently confident girls because they don’t seem intentionally mean. 
360,"Not finding The One.

While friends and mentally healthy people were settling down in good relationships, I was dating idiots who sucked any fun, confidence and self respect I had out of me.

I've been single for so long, sorting myself out, that I can't imagine sharing my life with anyone. I've become so self sufficient, I can't imagine letting anyone in. It takes me so long to warm up to people and trust them, I don't think I'll ever be able to date and see where it could go. "
361,"Just hold a pillow over his head, he will stop snoring in a couple of minutes "
362,"Yes, it's a thing, but it's not a thing for every mother. It does skew up slightly with age, but there are so many factors. Every pregnancy has risk. Some AMA (advanced maternal age) ones are easy, some are hard. For me, it just meant a few extra ultrasounds and the joy of being reminded I was ""OLD"" every 4 weeks at checkups.

I will say that 30 is very different than 24 and very different than 35. Give yourself the freedom to say, ""I will constantly reevaluate. I am 24-- I do not need to lock myself into thoughts like, ""30 is too young"" or whatever. It may be just right for you. It may not. Keep your options open. "
363,"I just told her it's not my thing. And holy hell, it totally isn't. All that unwanted attention, having to wear an uncomfortable dress and having to tend to the guests is just... tedious and tiring for an introvert like me.

She called me a traitor (jokingly ofc) and was okay with it in the end."
364,"Literally was me recently. 2 weeks shy of 3 years, he doesn't miss me when I'm gone. Done. Over. I'm so mad at myself for not leaving him when I wanted to earlier. God damn my sense of commitment."
365,"I had a person exactly like this who I had to cut.  A ""friendship"" of 20 years that I cut out because everything had to be about her. Growing up, if any attention was on me (boys especially) she'd get mad. I was not confident and Introverted so I was uncomfortable anyway, but as I flowered as a person she kept trying to squash me.

She married first, I supported her and came to all of the showers, events, etc.  She gets pregnant, I came to all of the stuff, bought nice presents especially because she had twins.  All of a sudden I get engaged, no congratulations, never comes to any of the events didn't come to the wedding. I was over it. I'm too old to be ""competing"" over life shit.

I need friends that celebrate with me, no that lord over me.  "
366,How dare you assume the type of love of other people. You don't know if their love spawns from a mutual geological interest.   /s
367,"Not OP - had a kid at 21 and one at 35. 

I’m a relatively fit person, more so than at 21 and pregnancy at 21 was way easier. Every pregnancy is different, but my body just did not roll with the changes as well in the later pregnancy. 

I was more tired, more swollen, my hair fell out and took longer to grow back, and my back was much more painful. The later pregnancy left me feeling old. Joint pain, fatigue, and just generally feeling less energy. 

Labor and delivery was a breeze at 21 and the recovery was quicker. 

The same could be said for parenting I think. It’s true I have more patience as an older mom, but I also have less energy. I know more and there’s more access to information now, but living on two hours of sleep at 35 is way harder than it was at 21. "
368,"By being a marketing major and having multiple classes where public speaking was a huge component. I learned it’s best to know the main points, and then speak extemporaneously. It keeps you from getting too nervous about forgetting a script, and allows you to sound natural and confident. To improve, it takes practice. Get yourself out there and just take all the opportunities you get to participate in public speaking! It’s scary at first, but it does get easier over time. At least that’s how it was for me :)"
369,"It's kind of hard.  I love with him in a foreign to me country.  I basically support him because he has huge debt bills every month, so I  buy all the food and do all of the household chores.  I'm saving up money so that when my current job contract is up, I can find my own place."

372,"Though I don’t regret it. Reminds of this quote by Stephen King. 
“Maybe there aren't any such things as good friends or bad friends - maybe there are just friends, people who stand by you when you're hurt and who help you feel not so lonely. Maybe they're always worth being scared for, and hoping for, and living for. Maybe worth dying for too, if that's what has to be. No good friends. No bad friends. Only people you want, need to be with; people who build their houses in your heart.”"

I've been to a wedding like that.  It didn't work.  Some kids got bored after an hour and started saying ""I want my mom"".

375,"Currently going through a divorce because of this. We both want different things, I was depressed for the last year trying to make it work. But in the end we grew apart and weren’t happy. I loved him, I still do, but I know he isn’t my meant to be. Always a hard thing to do, to leave someone you love, but if your needs aren’t being met and you aren’t happy is it worth staying together? IMO no, never "
376,"there's nothing you can do, absolutely nothing, about the fact that any of the people you love could die unexpectedly, today. every single day of your life this will be true. no amount of keeping yourself fit removes the possibility of a health disaster disabling you and making basic functioning painful and difficult for the rest of your life. you cannot rescue the people you care about from emotional pain. even disgustingly rich people can lose everything. the most important parts of your life, the things you care most about, will always have some large part of their success/failure dictated by cruel, blind chance, and you will never be able to change this.

but you just gotta keep going anyway."
377,"Oh, I don't do it anymore. It was really great, meaningful work but honestly, it fucking broke me. I have so much respect for social workers, because volunteering there for a couple years and seeing the stream of women and children was killing me. I quit the day after we had a one year old come in with third degree burns that her father had given her. If I had stayed, I would have lost all faith in humanity. Even the success stories weren't enough to cancel out the straight up fucking evil I kept seeing. "

379,I have an opposite story. I was asked to be a bridesmaid and found out at the bridal shower that I wasn’t a bridesmaid anymore when someone asked how many there were and the bride listed everyone that was there but me. I left the shower early and didn’t attend the wedding. I no longer speak to the bride or anyone in her circle of friends. We worked together so I saw her every day and she didn’t have the decency to tell me that I wasn’t a bridesmaid anymore.

386,"I felt like an asshole, but ended a friendship because she believed in too many weird things like the illuminati, that Madonna is a Satan worshiper, aliens created the Earth.  She went from being a cool friend to someone who only talked about really bizarre stuff and it was pretty embarrassing inviting her places.  The last straw was when she started telling me that I shouldn't have an epidural when giving birth and then going anti vax on me.  "
387,"Yup, that's basically the conclusion I came to as well. It was sad because at the time, meeting him did nothing but strengthen my crush on him but it obviously did the opposite for him. I think he loved the fantasy of having a younger, distant girl admire him but when it became ""too real"" he decided it was weird. Which I can't exactly hate him for having a change of heart like that, but it definitely felt like a punch to the gut especially since he was the one who begged me so hard to come see him. It was like as soon as he saw me IRL the fantasy balloon deflated and he realized that I was just another human being. Womp. "
388,"Related question: Did you guys have any complications? Was it harder physically to have a child in your late 30s?

I just turned 29 and my plan is to wait until I'm in my early 30s to start trying. My only worry is that once you're over the age of 35, the risk for defects go up exponentially. I'm also a nurse who works in the Pediatric ICU. And I'm sure working where I do exposes me to the scary outcomes more than the average person. But still, that's one of my greatest fears.

"
389,"Ooh, this is a good point. The more athletic and in-shape I am, the less of a hassle my period is, the less PMS I suffer from, and cramping and breakouts are much easier than when I'm less in shape. One of many reasons to keep fit and thin and active, IME, and I'm sure that professional athletes have stuff like that pretty fine-tuned"

392,"I've been using a period cup for almost a year now, and i love it!!

Will definitely not go back to tampons and i can really recommend it! :) "
393,"Only ever ended one adult friendship.

She was far too demanding with my time, and controlling over everything. "
394,"My ex of 10 years and I didn’t mess well sexually. Ever. Which led to our dead bedroom. He was very vanilla. Honestly, hardly even that. He was clueless and boring and selfish in bed. He never cared to try at even the most basic things. No foreplay. No affection. Hardly kissing. Rough, direct, and to the point. He even knew about my past of sexual abuse but it didn’t matter. I never enjoyed it. Never got mine. And he didn’t care. He’d just roll over and go to sleep. And I’d roll over and cry myself to sleep. Sex became such a chore and I’d dread it. 

Not to mention, the rest of our relationship was crap. He never worked and was extremely lazy and isolated me all the time. I was always stressed out and exhausted and depressed and angry with him. There was no longer an attraction. It got to the point where he’d sneak up on me in my sleep because he knew I wouldn’t have sex with him awake. My meds for said depression and anxiety made me a hard sleeper. I would wake up as he was finishing or the next day with no panties or they’d be on inside out or something. I felt disgusting and used and violated. Made me want him even less and killed our bedroom activities even more than I thought possible. I told him while awake that I didn’t want him to do that anymore. I didn’t like it and he needed to stop and doing it again would be rape since I’ve now told him No. He wouldn’t listen and it continued. It became a game, one even his friends knew about and joked about. It was horrible. 

I’d cry and tell him how selfish he was acting and how disgusting and unwanted he made me feel. Never helped. To sum it up, after 10 years and 2 children together I finally got sick of him antics inside the bedroom as well as the rest of our relationship and called off our engagement and kicked him out for good almost a year ago. Since then I’ve been with one other man that was a wonderful lover and helped me realize I do still, in fact, enjoy sex. "
395,Wow she’s pretty shitty
396,That movie was like simultaneously alien to me because of how social media has changed (all I had was AIM and LJ) and also absolutely 100% nailed how I felt as a teenager. What a brutally honest film. 
397,"Happened to me a lot. I was the back-up friend to a bunch of very mean girls. The worst time is when I was invited to a birthday party the day before. It was a “murder mystery dinner theater” type thing, but for kids and it was in a church basement in the middle of the afternoon. She told me my character and said to come dressed up for the part. I was excited despite the late invite and my mom helped me put together an awesome outfit! And then about 10 minutes after I arrive, before the mystery even starts, the girl who I was apparently replacing walks in, in costume, and says something about her other plans got cancelled so YAY she was able to come after all! The birthday girl immediately walked up to me and says I can leave because they don’t actually need me anymore. I was probably only 10 but I will never forget that humiliation as long as I live."
398,"""Doesn't remember it"" = every time his brain stumbles upon this vivid memory he feels like he's reliving the moment like watching a train wreck, and gets the feeling of wanting to hide under a rock and is committed to denying memory of it in hopes it dies lol"
399,"A lot of things!

One- how your entire body will be sore and tired afterwords. I was expecting my entire crotch area to be sore, and the belly as well but my throat was sore from yelling/grunting/making whatever weird sounds I was making (women in labor make all kinds of weird sounds lol), my arms were sore from pulling so hard on the handle bars of the bed, my legs were tired and sore from basically doing squats. 

Two- you know you’re gonna be sweaty during labor, but did you know you’re gonna sweat for days after birth? Doesn’t matter how cold it is, you’re gonna sweat a lot. 

Three- during labor, you will probably empty your stomach contents from one or both ends. 

Four- after the baby comes out, you need to deliver the placenta. Most doctors will press down on your belly, called a “uterine massage” to help the uterus contract and expel the placenta. THIS FUCKING HURTS. 

Five- it can be hard or painful to pee and poop after birth, sometimes. It’ll sting when you pee so use the water bottle, pooping will be weird and uncomfortable so take stool softeners. "
400,"Edit: Six hours after my post I realize this is r/askwomen and not r/askreddit. I'm a man, sorry if I'm intruding but got caught up in the experiences and wanted to share my own. See below for my post.

I dated a woman for a year then she got a job offer and moved cross country to CA for work and begged me to come with. I loved her, so I did.

She was there for 3 months while I was looking for a job and getting my life sorted to come with. I visited for two weeks during this time to be with her, find a place, and interview.
The visit was amazing,  and we talked and video chatted everyday I was back in Florida.

She was pretty homesick, and was having trouble acclimating to everything, but was really looking forward to when I could be there with her. 

I land a job via phone interview, we both celebrate. Early January I'm packing the truck, and getting ready for a cross country drive, leaving my siblings and parents, all of which I'm very close with, behind.

I notice she's sounding weird on the phone, she's being short on the video calls, but I chalk it up to her not being happy since she says she's ""fine"" and so I'm stressing trying to get there to help out.

One day into my drive, I'm talking to her before bed and she didn't say ""I love you too"" like she normally would... I ask her what's going on,  she tells me we'll talk when I get there. 

So now I have days of mindless interstate desert driving to think about what could be going on and what's changed.  She's not giving any details, being very short on the phone, and refusing to video chat. I'm barely sleeping at night from the stress while also driving 18 hours a day to try to get there as fast as I can.

I arrive to sign my apartment lease, half move in, shower and go to see her since she's now done with work. (She was a live-in Nanny so I couldn't move in with her)

I knock, she opens the door and from the look on her face I know what I've been of afraid of for days is true. Our relationship is over.

She explains to me over the next week that she's homesick (she's originally from Brazil), and that she wants to go back there to be with her family. Then it comes out that she started talking with her ex and is planning on getting back together with him on her return.

I'm barely processing my emotions at this point, trying to change her mind by just sending time together. She has a flight with plans to leave,  I get one week before she leaves the county.

We spend time together, getting along like we always did, still big chemistry and we're enjoying ourselves, until I'm reminded she's still leaving. One week passes, I drive her to the airport and she flew out of my life leaving me thousands of miles from anyone I cared about.

I was deeply depressed, I stayed for the duration of my 6 month lease, doing nothing but work, eat, sleep - repeat. Then drove back to FL.

TLDR

I planned for months, changed jobs, and moved thousands of miles to be with someone, and they left after a week."
401,Aw man that stings
402,"This breaks my heart and reminds me of a story. I was invited to the cool girl’s birthday party, but only because her parents made her invite the whole basketball team. I was always the outcast of the team because my mom was poor and worked night shift. So I had to bum rides or walk to practice. Apparently that gave them a good laugh. Anyways I begged my mom to get this girl a cool toy and I was so excited. I got to the party and she told everyone she didn’t even want me there. I was ostracized the whole time. When my mom picked me up I really did not want to tell her why I was upset because I knew she didn’t really have the money to spend on this girls present, but she did it for me. I was so ashamed, but she figured it out. She was so pissed that she had spent money on “that little brat. “ "
403,Why are you with this man then? 
404,"He cheated, and I didn’t find out until about a year after. Broke down and said he’d do anything to fix it, so I (stupidly) agreed to work things out. Then, over the next two years, he kept up this line of thinking that I was going to cheat on him as “revenge” and would question me every time I went to class, hung out with friends, etc. At first I brushed it off as him being scared, but over time it just got annoying. Even hurtful in a way, like just because you cheated doesn’t mean I’m capable of the same thing. 

I tried talking to him about it and how much it hurt me, but after a few weeks he’d fall back into the same old habits. Finally, one day something clicked, and realized that he was punishing me for his own mistake. I was being treated as untrustworthy even though I’d never given him cause. So I ended it. 

It’s been a few months, but I’m still learning just how much I ignored for so long. I’ve realized how distanced I became from friends and seeing all this time I spent catering to him versus myself. Just wish I would’ve seen it sooner. "
405,"I'm a parent and I think they are fine, as long as it's consistent. In my experience, many child-free weddings end up having some children who are allowed and then other guests who went to the trouble of finding child-care arrangements can feel slighted. "
406,"Not exactly the scenario OP asked for but my first BF/love recently reached out to me. He was my first love and we broke up 18 yrs ago. It was a nasty breakup. He was borderline abusive, very manipulative, and we were not good together regardless of how real our love was. I adored that man.
I finally left him after one too many accusations of me cheating. He was the one cheating.
I only picked up the phone when he called because I thought it was my daughter's daycare calling. He gushed about our relationship back then, and ended the call by telling me he loved me. I blocked him."
407,"I wish my friend understood this at the time. I had just quit my job to move back across the country to be with my family. I had zero money, hadn’t found a job yet, and was living with my mom. I had a deadline to get the dress and wasn’t going to be able to make it because I didn’t have the money. I offered to get a different dress when I would have the money but that wasn’t good enough for her. She stopped talking to me for a few months which really hurts when you guys were best friends. Things are back to normal with us now, but at the time it really sucked. "
408,I don't even have friends. 
409,"I'd also add that you can't hang out with them *and* your friends at the same time or you're always hanging out with your friends.

I REALLY like that you posted this here because it's super important survival info."
410,"So sweet. I also had a grandpa who was grandmother's ""friend"". Kinda a weird realisation as a kid isn't it? My grandfather died before I was born so never knew any different. Now grandma's friend has passed and grandma is still alive and kicking. Half convinced she'll outlive us all through sheer determination."
411,"Does Spotify count? I use it mostly as a phone app, maybe 80/20 between phone and desktop. "
412,"One of the reasons I balk at long distance love. It's easy to ""put it on"" for a weekend when they're visiting, but how can you get down to the nitty-gritty day to day that way? You don't truly know someone until it's Wednesday night, you're both exhausted, they are sick, and there's a sink full of dirty dishes. "
413,"I am *not* asking this to be mean, but would you say she settled, then? Or did she always have feelings for you as well/grew up and realized you were a good man to be with?"
414,"&gt; “If you want to have sex more often maybe we could try making it enjoyable for me.” 

I think that even in non-abusive situations, this line is very very common. For every ""she doesn't put out anymore"" complaint I hear from (mainly) men, I hear this equal and opposite from (mainly) women. IME, women's sex drives are far more reactive, and when seduction falls off, and is replaced with petulant complaints, throwing fits when being groped while doing the dishes doesn't work, and the total inability to see why she's not turned on from 0 to 60 with an ass-grab... yeah, it tends to make sense. Coupled with what is also common: doing the majority of the chores and upkeep, and having a confused spouse when no, stopping this chore or task or errand to fuck, like in early dating, doesn't work out for most adults. 

I can only imagine how much LESS fun it was with all of his addiction and other issues. I'm glad that you're out of that situation, and it's continually enlightening to me when a sex drive comes back when sex is being had by people that put in the effort to please their partner. I really hate the idea that women get frigid and asexual with marriage because, IME, it's almost always related to the seduction/ effort/ hygiene components that partners often neglect, too "
415,Thankyou so much for doing this post. I need this right now. 
416,"My first boyfriend was like that. Honestly thought it was something we'd grow out of as a couple? Made myself believe that I enjoyed it. It was after some sexual trauma from family that I realised this wasn't working for me. He didn't know how to NOT do that. He'd try to have sex with me even when he's comforting me when I'm upset about SEXUAL ABUSE!  He just didn't know how to stop. Then he'd get stroppy or think ""no"" means ""keep pestering me while I'm feeling vulnerable!"" I felt so worthless in that relationship lol. "
417,Pockets. Lack thereof. 
418,"It's fine by me. The couples can choose whether or not to permit children. If they don't, they will just have to understand that some people probably will not make the event due questions of childcare."
419,Awh that’s beautiful! Congratulations!
420,"Use the toilet so I won't feel like I need to pee during. Clean up downstairs using wet wipes and/or a washcloth. If necessary after a long day, clean pits or back with a washcloth. Check whether I need deodorant or body spray. Use mouth water. Depending on how much effort I want to put in I might do a quick shaving touch-up.

Not necessarily all of these all the time. But those sorts of things. "
421,When it’s only been a few weeks and he’s taking it upon himself to yell at my dog if he gets into the trash.   Bro is clearly feeling too comfortable
422,"Women love it if you play hard to get. 

It’s actually going to just make me stop asking you to do things and delete you from my contacts. "
423,"PUAs use techniques that would never work on a sane, emotionally stable woman which only reinforces their belief that all women are crazy. "
424,"Shoving myself into the little box society has defined as success. I took all the parts of me that made me “me”, and put them on a shelf to try and achieved success.
I moved out at 17, went to college in the STEM field and paid for it myself while working full time, climbed the career ladder, bought a nice car, bought a nice house, got engaged and was planning to get married and start a family.

And it damn near killed me. Six months or so ago, it’s like I woke up out of a nightmare and realized, I don’t want this life. I am not happy. I don’t get to be myself, I have no passions, and no really important relationships, or even defining characteristics at this point. I was a poster child of success and I didn’t want to wake up in the mornings anymore. I was working 70+ hours a week to pay the bills on a house I hated and did nothing else; that isn’t success.

So now, at 26, I’m completely starting over. I am an artists and I will pay my bills with my art. My relationship is failing, and we’ll probably never get married, and yet I somehow feel relieved. I will never have children, as I have absolutely no desire to be a mother. I shaved my head. Quit my job. Threw my degree in a dumpster. This is the complete opposite of what most people think of “success”, but goddamn do I feel like I am living again. My biggest regret in life is not deciding to live sooner."
425,"It's hard to be honest to family in an adult sense. You've grown up with them and they've seen all your faults, you've seen theirs. Even if they were either shitty to grow up with or the best sibling you could have, you never know how their judgement is going to be when they have their life completely in their own hands. And when they suck at it will you be the one that tells them they are being total assholes? "
426,"Realised 2 years ago after a serious bout of depression and panic attacks that I was living a life that was bad for my mental health. Unfortunately my husband was a part of the equation. 
Left my marriage and home (we have no kids thankfully). Moved away to a lovely seaside town with beautiful beaches and scenery. Good for the soul &amp; also for my dog. It's a long process. One step at a time. Our home is now sold. Divorce is the next step. 
I found listening to self-help audio books in the car to be a good use of travel time. 'Loving What Is' by Byron Katie very helpful and healing. Also- Oprah's book 'what I know for sure' is worth a listen. 
I can categorically say that I have made the right decision. I wasn't being true to myself all along. Slowly but surely now coming back to who I am. 
Everyone is different. If you stop and be still and listen to yourself you will know what is right for you. I spent a lot of time afterwards cocooned up in bed. At the time I put it down to depression but now I see it as part of my healing. It was instinctively what I needed at the time. 💗
Now I'm beginning to do a lot more. Changed my job. Moving up in my career. Doing well in general. Recently started seeing someone else. 
Life is good 💗"
427,"We've been together for almost 2 years and we haven't had a fight yet. We're just both laid back and we get along really well. So if one of us says something the other doesn't agree with (like one of us loves a song and the other hates it), we'll be like "" Is this gonna be our first fight?!"" Then we'll have a pretend argument about it, saying the most ridiculous and unreasonable stuff until we can't hold it in and we burst out laughing. "
428,"I had a guy once come to my house in a rented Lamborghini. It was odd because I knew what he drove already, and it wasn't a Lamborghini, lol... I asked him why he had it and his only answer was that he wanted to impress me.

I didn't understand why he did that at all. But I guess I appreciated the effort..

To clarify, you can impress me with a McDonalds and a box of chocolates, not a Lamborghini lol x"
429,Whenever he thinks he told me something and he hasn’t I tell him “You must be confusing me with your other wife”
430,OKay I relate to your comment a lot. So what ending up happening? Did you end it? Are you still together?
