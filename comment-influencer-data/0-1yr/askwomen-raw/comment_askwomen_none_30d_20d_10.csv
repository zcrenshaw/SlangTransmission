3,"Sorry this has nothing to do with the post but I’m a teenage dude and in a skit for class I played a Regina character like in Mean Girls, I was entirely unprepared for the role but my monotone deep voice apparently made it really funny and it was a blast to do, I think I have a video somewhere"

8,"I'm living this right now. I love my boyfriend but he has self esteem issues for sure and puts me on a pedestal. It's really hard to feel like I just don't love him the way he loves me. May I ask, what did you do? Or how did it end? I'm so sorry you dealt with this; it really is so difficult."

19,"This might sound cliche but if he really loves you he will most likely accept it. Even if it's a bit uncomfortable at first, I think that knowing intimate details like that about your partner makes the relationship stronger and creates trust. I don't know him but I'm sure most decent guys wouldn't even think of leaving when their SO tells them a secret like that.

25,"Basically it's meant for yes or no answers to be skewed so that either way, the answerer implies that s/he would want to go on a date with the asked. 

If you say yes to the question, meaning your answers would be the same, then you are also saying yes to a date. 

If you are saying no to the question, meaning your answers would not be the same, then you are not saying no (i.e. saying yes) to a date. 

TLDR; The question is geared so that either way, the answerer would agree to a date with the asker."

Best: seeing  little kids faces light up when you  flex, the feeling of accomplishment at the end of a workout, feeling better about how I look. 

Worst: that one guy who assumes he knows more than you just because he's a dude and is always wrong with his ""correction"" but gets super offended if you tell him to fuck off. Luckily, they're easy to avoid once they make themselves  known. 

Also, pants fit funny."
30,"Similar thing happens to skinny guys who turn up to lift. Women and skinny guys always stick out in the free weight part because they look nervous, but honestly the big lads lifting ain't paying much attention to others. They are too busy lifting or looking at themselves in the mirrors haha.

I hope you give it another chance and just go to do your lifts. The few women who use this area at my gym at first looked nervous, but after a few times they seemed to get past it. Unless you are obstructing their view of themselves or hogging the racks / benches excessively, the are is a lot more welcoming than it seems on the outside. There's this 50 something woman been squatting for months now, I noticed the weight increase dramatically and a few of the lads went over to tell her she was killing it. She had this massive beaming smile then. Since then she's talked to a few of us regulars and she asks us to spot for her occasionally. 

Hopefully your gym is as friendly as ours and the atmosphere doesn't put you off."

My eyebrows are always filled in and I wear mascara and usually a light taupe color in my crease.

42,It actually probably makes you look more attractive to be honest.  You could always do made-to-measure or custom tailored clothing.  Myself and more than a few guys I know have to do this (it's cheaper than all the modifications).
43,What else can you make in a bread maker?
44,Spring break 2012 I went to Panama City Fl with some friends. I roomed with my best friend. Our first day there we go to the beach. I head back to the room to take a huge shit. My room is 312. When I get to the room the doors open. I was super pissed at my friend for not shutting it. I walk in the bathroom and start pooping. I leave the bathroom door open assuming I’m alone. I hear my friend come in so I yell out that I’m pooping and I can’t get up to shut the door. I look up and there’s a girl I’ve never met in my life standing there.  Turns out my room was 212 not 312. What made it worse is while she was standing there and I was past the point of be able to hold it so I straight up pooped 5 feet in front of a girl I’ve never met. I wanted to just swim out to sea and never come back. She was actually pretty cool. She let me finish at least. I didn’t tell my friends until like 4 days later.

48,California?
49,"I lifted weights for the first time this year, for a few months before lapsing from the gym. The best for me is that I've never felt so strong and powerful, and I loved noticing that I was actually getting to be muscular. And I just felt better overall, physically and mentally. Also, my main workout (when I'm working out) is yoga, and it was a lot easier to do yoga regularly when I was lifting. The worst was basically always being sore in some way (hence the yoga)."
50,I've recreated that beautiful stack at home! It was fun to make and was yummy.
51,My school had a group of girls that called themselves the Ringwraiths.... speaks volumes
52,"Marie Kondo's drawer/cabinet organization recommendations. She recommends organizing stuff in junk drawers and kitchen by size, not by function, with little boxes/trays. That way you'll know exactly where the scissors/batteries/buttons/scotch tape are, just look for the little tray with the stuff the same size as the thing you're looking for."
53,My crush  from primary school who I haven't seen for 8 yrs. His birthday was a day before mine which was cool
54,"These are all interesting points from a male perspective, and it shows you've thought about it for some time.  I've also spent a lot of time in internal turmoil thinking about this, because I know my standards are different from what you see on TV and what is generally out there, in my experience.

&gt;Physical incompatibility. Sometimes our bits just don’t work well together. Size, shape, tightness, sensitivity, angles of stimulation. Everyone is built differently and it’s unreasonable to think that “one size fits all”.

I've had sex a few times before, generally involving extreme amounts of alcohol.  I've only had sex with 3 guys, which I regret, and I thought the size would matter, but in the end they were all the same. I mean it isn't rocket science, it's a d in a hole.  You hear all these things about size mattering and how men are so insecure about their size, all these pills they take and even surgery to be 'bigger'.  That's such a farce. Unless he's in the freakish huge or teensy tiny end of the spectrum, they are all the same, and have the same effect.  I quickly broke up with them after though, because once men get a taste of sex once, they're like sharks in a feeding frenzy and couldn't stop pestering for more.  Constantly calling, and always trying to turn the conversation to something sexy to try to get me in bed again.  It was weird and kind of sad.         

&gt;Mental incompatibility. Some people are unable to let go sexually without a certain mindset from both partners coming together to make it a perfect situation for both parties to enjoy. Not everyone thinks about it in the same way, and people should not have to completely compromise who they are.

That is true. To me, sex just for the sake of it is worthless and cheap.  You're basically his free prostitute for the night that he doesn't have to pay in the morning.  I could only really let go if I were safe, secure and married, and I knew this would be our lives and future together, and I was pleasing my husband to make him happy and to strengthen our bond.  Otherwise, you're just risking getting pregnant or some disease, being used like a tissue paper that he throws away after a jerk off, or a few months after the novelty wears off.  Men may or may not agree, but this is the Ask Women thread and I'm giving my perspective as one female.

&gt; Libido/ drive incompatibility. This is so often just how our hormones are. Some guys only want it once a month, some girls want it ever day. This is not because people are covering up depression like you said, you clearly don’t understand that it’s a biological thing. Some people just don’t have any desire of sex at all.

Well you look at someone like Jeffrey Epstein, he claimed to ""need"" sex regularly 3 times a day, and he just committed suicide.  Anthony Bourdain was another known sexaholic who struggled with depression and committed suicide.  I disagree, the one guy I knew who claimed to need sex every few hours was also a deeply depressed man who basically depended on sex to pick up his brain hormones.  He was addicted to the dopamine rush of sex, like a cocaine addict, and once the high wore off he was down in the emotional trenches again, feeling worthless, ill, life is empty, we are all going to die in this void of misery, etc.  Sex was a momentary high and then he was back low again.  That's a huge red flag, a guy who needs sex several times a day.  Every woman should avoid that type of person.  Every man too, if a woman is constantly riding you it's a problem with her brain, she's using sex like a drug and will get her fix the way a heroin addict will, by any means necessary, including doing your friends, her co-workers or your family if you aren't around.

&gt;Kinks. Some people just like it a bit rougher. Some need slow passionate love making. Some like the visual side of sex. Some like to be more dominant than others. Some need to submit to feel that connection. Most people don’t know what they like until they start having sex, or feel safe enough to explore their own sexuality.

I guess, kinks bore me, they usually involve degrading women in some way and many are downright creepy.  The guys who like domanitrixes are funny but I don't think I could ever boss a guy around or call him my bitch.  That's too disrespectful to him, I just don't have it in me to treat a decent guy that way.


&gt;There are many more incompatibilities, sexuality is very complicated. I feel your approach towards it is shaming in a way, and can be irresponsible to represent it the way you do. You are talking about extremes of multiple partners every other day, where I am talking about committed, responsible, loving relationships. 

Well, I'm curious.  How would you respond if your girlfriend told you tomorrow she's pregnant?  Would you pay for the abortion, walk her down the row of anti-abortion people chanting ""baby killer!"" to get her to her appointments, ask to get married, or just offer to give her some money ever month for the kid?  I mean, sex leads to babies, that's what it's meant for.  You take that risk every time. There's a tiny but present chance the condoms will eventually have some kind of slight defect that leads to pregnancy. My friend who got HIV was with a man in a relationship.  He had experimented with a few injected drugs during high school.  He didn't know he was HIV+.  Or maybe he did, but he knew she wouldn't sleep with him if he told her.  Who knows.  I don't mean to be shaming, I'm just putting it out there, you put your future at risk sleeping with someone. 

&gt;I have never had any std, or had an encounter with someone that has one. You can manage birth control responsibly, and practice safe sex easily. Over the 15 years I have been sexually active, I have not had any of the problems you are talking about. I have however, found out early on in relationships that we just aren’t a match. I would hate to live a life with someone without the meaningful, beautiful, mind blowing, deep intimacy that sex brings to a relationship.

Every. Single. Guy. I have dated has promised me the Ultimate Earth-Shattering Mind-Blowing Orgasm^TM that he alone and his equipment alone can provide.  Which sounds fabulous, if we were married, secure, and building a future together.  I don't look at unmarried men like Disneyland funrides that you can 'experience'.  That is kind of revolting to me. 

&gt;That said, there is no reason to pressure someone into sex. That just does not happen with love. No means no, and if anyone can’t respect that, then it isn’t a relationship you should be in. Easy as that.

Yes, agree very much.

&gt;I’m so glad for you that you have someone that echoes your sentiment, just please don’t think that everyone should be that way, or that someone wanting to have a sexual relationship in a responsible manner is doing anything wrong.

No worries, I realize I'm an old-fashioned throwback in this modern world."
55,"When I grow up, I wanna be *just* like Sauron!"
56,My favorite thing is the feeling of accomplishment and pride when I see muscle development. I also like the way it makes me look. My least favorite thing is that it does come with a bit too much focus on my body and how it looks and is changing at times.
57,Any sort of manipulation.
58,PURPLE FLURP from Jimmy Neutron
59,"Getting to wear my long black coat, boots and dark lipstick"
60,"Middle school mainly. Nothing to that extreme. 

High school wasn’t like that for some reason. I was a loner and my mom was sick the majority of the time. I mingled with all groups though. I was like a mix between preppy, goth, and me."
61,"Umm I’m sure some crazy ones would. 


But Jesus’ whole thing was like.. No sex etc."
62,"Yeah, I'm feeling the ramen more."
63,"Lately make up hasn’t helped my self esteem but its eyebrows, eyeshadow (one color), and mascara. Del ding on my mood, I’ll do blush and bronzer to even out my color"
64,"It started on my first day of kindergarden and never stopped straight thru graduation. I'm definitely permanently scarred by how mean these group of girls were. Sometimes there were multiple groups. In smaller groups i went to, just one group. It was awful."
65,"Girls in my middle school took spreading false rumors to new levels. They got the entire school (including adults) to believe that I had an incestuous relationship with my father. They even wrote a ""confession"" full of details, signed my name, and left it in the health/sex ed teacher's desk.   


Authorities got called and everything. *Thank God* for one decent girl who watched them do the whole thing and took it upon herself to testify that I didn't write it. She was too scared to give the names of the girls who did, although I certainly can't blame her. She had a reason to be scared of them."
66,"Best thing: Seeing more muscle definition.

Worst thing: It takes so long ://"
67,Oh. Im so sorry for your loss... I hope you get better and that therapy will help you with your grieving. 😢

69,Can't agree enough on the bidet.
70,"It's not as good as the book makes it out to be, but it's pretty yummy. Im always sad when I eat it tho bc it's not worth a kingdom."
71,"Satsuki’s bento box for me, but then Totoro was the main Ghibli film I watched as a child. Even those veggies from the garden seemed so crisp and fresh."
72,"This was definitely true for me too! In high school the popular girls were generally nice and social “camp councillor” types. But there were a ton of boys who were popular not because they were likeable, but because they were “cool”. They’d make fun of learning disabled kids and tear people’s art down in the hallway. Super douchey."
73,"Double commenting but this made me remember my best friend and I (still best friends after 24yrs yay) when we were 5-6yrs old we watch Popeye and asked her mum to get us a can of spinach each. And because she knew we’d hate it, if course she got it for shits and giggles and apparently we refused to eat dinner that night from trauma and it took me years to eat spinach again haha 

More an opposite to what you are asking answer"
74,No my man already looks like jesus
75,I would inhale a krabby patty.
76,"I get what you're saying, and I do agree. In moderation, seeking out new things, food, and travelling is definitely a fulfilling hobby for many people and that's a great thing. My point really was what I said before, ie *when it's in excess*. Of course, different people have different criteria and thresholds for when it becomes excessive."
77,"I feel like CrossFit can be a little bit hard on joints etc and less an actual good workout for cardio and muscles, almost like most CrossFit programs are made to keep people entertained rather than actually progressing in fitness"
78,"Same! In middle school, all the girls were super nice. Even the popular pretty girls. It was the boys that would tease and bully thinking they were being funny."
79,Being able to wear layers and tons of black without melting.
80,"20 years and then 2 to get out since our stuff was so entangled. I guess 2 reasons made me stay, afraid of change and thinking I should stay cause it's been so long. I was emotional ally detached  before I was able to move out. I'll never go back!"
81,"They actually made them for a while back in the early 00s and the green stuff was really in the middle and it was good! I wouldnt be suprised if i saw them in one of those pop-culture candy shops in the mall or thinkgeek,hot topic or the box lunch stores"
82,"At a hotel once, I checked in but just went into the room to put my stuff down and go to the bathroom, and went back out. Later, when I was getting ready for bed, I pulled down the sheets to get in, and there was one single piece of poop and a used tampon, I don't even know if it was human poop, directly in the middle of the bed, just minding its own business. I went downstairs and told them, and they got me another room, but it took over 2 hours, and by that time it was like 1 AM. Now I check everything as soon as I get in the room. I don't want any more surprises"
83,Oh no! It definitely is one of those trial and error things. I’ve followed a couple recipes and it turns out right. Don’t give up.
84,My bestfriend. We have been distant recently due to me going back to my husband. My husband and I were on the verge of divorce and my best friend whom is a male stepped up and helped me and my daughter for almost a year. I had to have emergency surgery to have my colon removed and my soon to be ex husband at the time reentered the picture and we have been trying to work on things. My bestfriend kind of distanced himself from me. We still talk but barely. He was and still remains one of the biggest support system I've ever had and I cant help but think I fucked up somehow going back with my ex.
85,OMG I loved David the Gnome but no one I've talked to about it remembers that show! I almost started thinking I imagined it as a kid since it didn't seem like anyone else ever watched it lol
86,My bed.
87,"I always see people say this, and I am often given the feedback that I am ""straightforward"" or ""frank"". People often say it in a complimentary manner; it's a trait of mine they like. I always wonder what it is I'm doing that isn't crossing into ""asshole"" territory. I personally don't perceive a difference in how I speak compared to others. I am also probably on the spectrum, so that would explain some of it.

Generally the only people who ever call me rude are people who themselves have reputations for being assholes. It's really interesting that they are the only ones who ever hate my honesty...I know I'm not as nice to them, but I figure there's no point in me being courteous when you won't afford the same to me. I'm fine with alienating jerks, though. Everyone else says I'm often too nice."
88,"If i were available I'd like a man to just be himself. No acts. No poses. Maybe a little shy. (I think that's attractive)

Speaking for myself I wouldn't want (or expect) an Adonis. He wouldn't have to have perfect hair or teeth, or be wearing expensive clothes. Just neat and clean."
89,"From The Jungle creature: Hugo from 93, Hugo are on a boat and the chef there offers him a meatball and I just wanted that so badly when I was younger. Almost rivaling, but not quite is when Hugo falls into a bakery. 

Second place is the candy store that Pippi Långstrump (Longstockings) enters in one of the Swedish movie adaptations. 

And now I'm hungry."
90,"One girl from my class catfished another one of my classmates. This was in 2006 and she pretended to be the boy our classmate had a crush on and flirted with her through texts. She then proceeded to read their conversations aloud to her friends when the classmate wasn't there. I didn't figure out what she was doing until a friend of hers told me about it. Wish I could say I did the right thing and told the classmate about it but the girl was super popular and ridiculously mean and didn't think twice about turning a whole class against someone and I was shy, quiet, and scared."

94,"Yeah us outwardly emotionless robots feel things really deeply, it's great that you recognise that."
95,"oooh, which one?"
96,"My “Mean Girl” was a girl named Abigail. I made the varsity soccer junior year of high school, after being cut freshman year and not trying out sophomore year. I got really back into soccer that summer. Worked my ass off conditioning, I was one of the fastest  (if not the fastest). Making the team was one of my biggest accomplishments, even if it meant I was bullied during the season.

When I joined, I immediately felt uncomfortable around the girls. I hadn’t made the bonds they had the two previous years. Cliques had been established, and I was this girl who just kind of showed up. 

Abigail intentionally made it her mission to shut me out of group circles, would deliberately ignore my presence on the field, and didn’t invite me into a “secret” soccer group chat she led on the side. Snide comments and whispers, both about me and other girls, were her strong suit. Everyone on the team knew, too. At the same time, everyone disliked her, but people were afraid to say shit. It got to a point where I had to go to the athletic director for her bullying, but because she hadn’t physically hurt me or verbally harassed me, they didn’t consider it bullying. However, I argued that it was, in fact, emotional bullying, as she had completely isolated me. I wish I could name specifics, but it’s been so long that I think my brain intentionally shut things out.

I ended up leaving the season completely unconfident in my soccer abilities. Never tried out again. In fact, it’s my biggest high school regret. Not really the soccer thing (didn’t really care much for the program, anyway).... more like, not standing up for myself. I think I’m a victim of her bullying, but I also believe I’m a victim of my own lack of confidence. 

On the bright side, the girl I knew 5 years ago isn’t the same person now. I learned my lesson from that shit. I don’t fuck around with people like that anymore. Happily. I’ve learned over the years not to take it. My advice to you is don’t take it, either. Stand up for yourself, talk to people, and know you’re not alone!"
97,Got diagnosed with pcos. I hate it very much. There’s no cure for it yet and we can only just manage our symptoms and have a healthy lifestyle. Reading comments from other women with pcos has kinda helped me because that’s when I felt I’m not alone.
98,I think an answer to my reply would answer OPs question and is not derailing.If anything it is helping the question  expand and help OP more.
99,The ramen from ponyo!! I can imagine it’s like a cuddle in a bowel and better than anything I’ve ever made
100,Arms... hurt.

102,I find it odd that I asked if Ireland had bees and you took it as if I said the entire European region didn't have bees. But sure.
103,30s rock
104,"I didn't want kids, it wasn't something I thought about often, but I knew I had other things I wanted to do. Military, travel were on the top of the list. 

At 18 I fell pregnant and 19 I had my son. I have a very rocky relationship with my mom, she tried to convince me to abort him. I was determined that even though he wasn't planned I'd be a good mom. 

The 1st 2 years of his life I was an immature mess and my dad basically raised him. When I was 21 I finally started to realize how important it was to not just be a occasional presence. 

At 24 I had my daughter, also unplanned. As soon as she was born I immediately had my tubes tied. 

My son is now 14, my daughter 9. Both are amazing, intelligent people. They both bring me so much love, joy and happiness. 

I wish I'd waited until I was more mature, but if I could do it all over I'd be more present with my son, as I was with my daughter in those early years. I had to really work to be a good mom for him, and for my daughter it seemed to come more naturally. At 18 you think you're so grown, the truth is you're still a baby yourself."
105,So your relationship is based on a lie ?
106,"I haven’t seen the others, but doesn’t Ex Machina completely reverse that idea? She acts naive in order to gain the guy’s trust and eventually is revealed to be more devious than the male characters."
107,"What's so extreme about socialism, exactly? Workplace democracy? Human rights and decent living standards for all, not just a select few? I fail to see the comparison to the far-right. Labeling both as ""extremism"" seems disingenuous. Considering how horribly humans are treated and how hard people struggle to survive, despite the abundance created by technology, I'd say the status quo is already pretty ""far right""."
108,"Just finished my first year of college and this is so familiar to me. I have a lot of inattentive symptoms and even some hyperactive ones starting as a kid, but it never affected me academically.

I did some tests this summer and the nurse told me after a Q&amp;A that because there were no major negative effects I shouldn't be diagnosed with ADHD. I don't necessarily want medication, but to know whether I have ADHD or not because it seems to have affected me in other ways my whole life"
109,That sucks! Hope you've been to see a Dr about it? I injured my back a while ago and its been horrible having to work around it or just not do certain exercises. As well as needed to take time off for it to heal. Not fun!
110,"The self appointed popular girls in my year were called the Bummers, because they all bummed each other. They were ok, I'd occasionally hang with them, but they had super complex inner social dynamics. The most popular one of them was always very sweet to me, and we went to the same uni where I had some bad mental health problems, she was constantly having me round and feeding me nice home made food."
111,"&gt;Women who have “not like other girls” entitlement whether this be from cheap contemporary novels or irl

Ugh, this so much, along with men seeking those types out."
112,Dark reference?
113,None but I’m a dog groomer so there’s no point. I love makeup and beauty though and last year worked in retail for a while to take a break from grooming and I thought it would be nice having a job where I could look nice....well that lasted about a week and j stopped wearing makeup to work again because makeup was no longer fun for me when I felt like I had to wear it.
114,"At my school, there were a few different groups of popular girls. Some with more drama and fights and others that were also AP kids, in band or theatre, etc. The lines between groups aren’t as clear as that movie makes it seem. 

That said, I do notice that my friends who were popular in school tended to have a lot more drama in their lives. Hating somebody one week and hating a different person the next. This went for guys and girls, though in my experience girls tend to target other girls and guys target both."
115,"Recently, I started using primer, concealer, eyebrow gel, eyeliner, and mascara. I do it because it feels good to take some time  in the morning to look good. Plus, it makes me look more awake and presentable."
116,"I work in a call center so we can wear whatever as long as it’s appropriate. 

When I dress up: bb cream, concealer, fill in eyebrows, eyeshadow on a really special day, eyeliner, mascara, and highlighter.

Most days: eyebrows, eyeliner, mascara"
117,"I tried acid, shrooms, e... but i knew coke wasnt for me and anything “harder” was not worth losing my life over. Come from a family of addicts. 

I think acid was fun but i didnt like how my body felt and the last few times always got “dark” 

e was amazing and made my time in high school memorable. But we def wasted a lot of money on doing it. Good waste. Long term,  i suffer from depression that may have be amplified by the long term effects of e. 

Shrooms. Everyone should do them. So much fun. Only did it twice and thats my biggest regret. Now im too old, too busy. 

Legally im very lucky."
118,Yup I like
119,"If you have a Roku, there's an app called quick remote that works with Alexa/Google Home.  It's a bit clunky but better than nothing if you're not near the remote."
120,"There is a certain type of attention seeking I can’t stand. I had this roommate that would constantly make comments on her body so that we would compliment her and she would act way more drunk than she really was and laugh really obnoxiously loud so that people would pay attention to her. If she wasn’t the center of attention at a gathering, she would dead-ass leave. It was so annoying."
121,Very common.  Still are very common.
122,"Not at all.

We weren't a movie of stereotypes, we were real life people."

125,"I wear quite a bit. Work is my time to have fun with makeup. Foundation, powder, blush, highlighter, fill in my brows, and usually heavier eyeshadow with heavy mascara."
126,"See none of them are even close to as pretty or generally successful in popularity as Regina is. None of them are as smart either. They just try REALLY hard to be her, and fail miserably. Which I guess is better for people like me that have to deal with them."
127,"Best: adds a lot of confidence especially when you're a little 5'3 pipsqueak like me. I love the way I look and challenging my body to evolve. It's also given me personal confidence when dudes don't try to belittle me anymore and people pointing out that I look big (I'm such a bro at heart sometimes). 

Worst: sleeves are almost always too tight or just finding clothes that fit well overall. Having to pump iron and eat right twice as hard as dudes just to get even remotely decent definition. Not a lot of off days and even on days where you don't wanna go or have a bad lift, you just gotta suck it up.

Overall worth it. I get to eat well and never have to rely on anyone for help in lifting. It's liberating! And you looking fuckin badass. Keep grinding, ladies!"

129,"In high school, not as much. In middle school, oh yeah. There was one girl who that movie could have been based on. 

Her mom/parents always dressed her in the trendiest clothes and she'd have her hair and nails done. At the time, Madonna was huge and I remember that for our 6th grade talent show, her mom peroxided her hair perfectly and she did the whole ""writhe around in the wedding dress"" routine while lip-syncing Like a Virgin. We were 11! 

In the movie, with the little sister imitating the Milkshake dance, I totally thought of her."

131,"Aw, B&amp;BW cucumber melon spray was the official scent of the 90s. Way to bring it back!"
132,"My high school was big so there were lots of groups and many different ones that were considered popular. Plus people were often involved in a variety of activities so I feel like there was overlapping, rather than strictly art kids, jocks, nerds etc."

134,"I'll certainly have to try it as a snack, though I try not to eat snacks at my desk at work"
135,"It's the style of weightlifting done in the Olympics and consists of two lifts - the snatch and clean and jerk. In the snatch you get the bar to overhead in one motion, in the clean and jerk you get the bar to your shoulders (clean) and then overhead (jerk) in separate motions. You compete in weight classes and get 3 attempts at each lift. Most of the drive and power comes from leg and back strength.

138,"Robot vacuum, air filter, pressure washer, bidet, toaster oven"
139,"I LOVE seeing the muscle definition in my body. I'm in a place where I'm perfectly happy with how I look, and now it's just more about maintaining it than gaining more.

The worst thing is people have actually asked me if I had any ""help,"" like drugs or supplements, and they don't believe me when I tell them I actually worked at it and didn't take shortcuts"

146,"My thing is the texture. Texture of bananas, so mushy. Squishy strawberries in smooth yogurt... needs granola for texture!"
147,Sweating (slightly less). Scarves. ANKLE BOOTS. It being crisp and a little chilly when I take my boyfriend's dog out in the morning.
148,"*sigh* fine, just judging other women then."
149,"Thanks! I started therapy about two years back when I was 23 years old. I’m back there now because with the recent death of my brother I needed some unpacking. 

My therapist really helped me understand my mom. Which I guess makes me more empathetic towards her instead of hating her."
150,Really obnoxious attention seeking
151,Everyone should have a bidet! I have an attachent on every toilet in the house and it's the thing I miss most when traveling.
152,"While I understand where you are coming from, and if that works for you, by all means, I respect that, and I’m glad you have someone that respects that as well, but I don’t think you understand how sexuality actually works.

When I mentioned sexual incompatibility, I mean way more than sexual preference or the horror stories you mention.

Physical incompatibility. Sometimes our bits just don’t work well together. Size, shape, tightness, sensitivity, angles of stimulation. Everyone is built differently and it’s unreasonable to think that “one size fits all”.

Mental incompatibility. Some people are unable to let go sexually without a certain mindset from both partners coming together to make it a perfect situation for both parties to enjoy. Not everyone thinks about it in the same way, and people should not have to completely compromise who they are.

Libido/ drive incompatibility. This is so often just how our hormones are. Some guys only want it once a month, some girls want it ever day.  This is not because people are covering up depression like you said, you clearly don’t understand that it’s a biological thing. Some people just don’t have any desire of sex at all.

Kinks. Some people just like it a bit rougher. Some need slow passionate love making. Some like the visual side of sex. Some like to be more dominant than others. Some need to submit to feel that connection. Most people don’t know what they like until they start having sex, or feel safe enough to explore their own sexuality.

There are many more incompatibilities, sexuality is very complicated. Once you start having sex, you will understand this. I feel your approach towards it is shaming in a way, and is completely irresponsible to represent it the way you do. You are talking about extremes of multiple partners every other day, where I am talking about committed, responsible, loving relationships. I have never had any std, or had an encounter with someone that has one. You can manage birth control responsibly, and practice safe sex easily. Over the 15 years I have been sexually active, I have not had any of the problems you are talking about. I have however, found out early on in relationships that we just aren’t a match. I would hate to live a life with someone without the meaningful, beautiful, mind blowing, deep intimacy that sex brings to a relationship.

That said, there is no reason to pressure someone into sex. That just does not happen with love. No means no, and if anyone can’t respect that, then it isn’t a relationship you should be in. Easy as that.

I’m so glad for you that you have someone that echoes your sentiment, just please don’t think that everyone should be that way, or that someone wanting to have a sexual relationship in a responsible manner is doing anything wrong."
153,It has helped me tremendously. My mom sleeps in same house as me. I have an air purifier in my room and I never get sick while it seems she’s sick every couple months.
154,yaaaassssss Go you!!!!!
155,"The smell of fall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Walking the dogs along the trails and enjoying the gorgeous colours. 

Leggings, tall boots and SWEATER WEATHER!!!!!!"
156,"I’m a huge introvert. I do have anxiety but it’s general, not social. 

I don’t think I live in an extroverted world, I think there’s definitely a balance. 

One thing I wish people would understand is that I am happy with my life, nothing is wrong with me, and I want my lifestyle to be left alone. 

Family members and friends of family are constantly telling me that I need to go out more and party because I “won’t be 20 forever.” Or they assume I’m depressed. I don’t want to go out. I don’t want to party. I’m perfectly fine going to work, coming home to my dog, and being a homebody."
157,Spider plants! Hard to kill and non-toxic to cats. They also look great in a hanging pot!
158,"I had the EXACT same experience. I’m so sorry you went through that, and I completely understand. I used to fake being sick so much because I just didn’t want to face the shitty kids at school. I was eight when we immigrated to Canada and I knew zero English as well. They made fun of me for having to take ESL classes, for the “weird” foreign foods I brought for lunch, for doing math problems differently (we learned the stuff in a different way back home). Just the smallest things about me became their ammo. I still think about that time in my life 22 years later. Thankfully, kids are like sponges so I’m pretty sure I picked up English in less than a year."
159,Aristocats.
160,The tea that Ponyo and Souseke drink in Ponyo. Idk why it just always looked like it would make you melt lol
161,Lol it’s actually my middle name!! But that’s what I go by!
162,"Generally the VERY wealthy dont need gloat their status &amp; make comments like that. My boyfriend's sister is VERY wealthy &amp; I've known a few other like her. She knows my clothes is thrifted &amp; she herself likes antique stores. I feel those concerned with brands, what others wear etc come from insecurity &amp; are trying to overcompensate"
163,Constantly updating their social media
164,Passive-aggressive people.
165,"I avoided watching Mean Girls for the longest time because every girl in my grade absolutely loved it and all their memes, little traditions (pink on Wednesdays, etc) made it clear they thought the Plastics were the heroes of that story. Just to give an idea of the kind of girls I went to school with."

169,"I love how strong I am and how much confidence I have. I love my shoulder muscles so much and my leg muscles. 

However, I don’t like the way I look in dresses anymore. They don’t feel like me anymore. Weightlifting makes me feel less like a lady but more of an Amazon and that personality shift has been reflected in my clothing. 

But do I look good? Hell yeah. I walk into a room and am an immediate badass."
170,Yes!!!
171,Do you just strictly do those lifts only when you workout? Like you don’t do a leg day or back day type thing ? Just curious
172,"I love to lift weights and how my body looks and feels afterwards, i just hate the fact that during this summer months i cant go and ive noticed my body getting soggy again, im 5'2(160) with 40kg (around 90lb) so yeah thats a whole difference, i was starting to get on weight, eating more, but since i stopped all fell down, hoping getting back soon because it also helps my mental state and to relax. The least, i guess not having machines available when i need them, do abs or arms stuff, i totally hate them but i know i need to get muscle on them, also how i cant even lift stuff afterwards because of the soreness."

178,"I really hate the ""that's just how I am"" attitude. We ALL need to grow and evolve, and sometimes if you care about people you have to adjust parts of how you express yourself accordingly.

185,"I hit a guy in the face with a 7in platform during my 3 years of stripping. I was 19. He refused to pay, called me a stupid wh*re, and tried to assault me. My shoes were already off and I grabbed one by the heel and hit him. Busted his eyebrow. Joke was on him... I got my money and he got kicked out. 

Fuck you Len"
186,"Political Parties are like cable TV subscriptions.

All you really want is the Discovery Channel, but they make you pay for all this other garbage.

I'm registered independent.

That doesn't mean I vote 3rd Party.

It means I decide on a case-by-case basis."
187,"People who use being sarcastic as a pass to be an asshole. You're not a ""sarcastic person who just tells it like it is"", and people don't need to ""stop being such snowflakes"", you're just a dick."
188,"From Mary Poppins, right?"
189,"I feel you, i felt the same at my last gym, there was lots of buff dudes, then there was me a tiny tini skinny girl with no muscles lifting weights, but not on my now gym, although dudes look, theres more females going there and even tho when there arent any, i still go, im there to work out, i know i dont look that fit like the other girls do, but im trying at least. Let them look."
190,My kids. Always.
191,"I definitely had girls like that in middle school. By high school, especially the last two years, everyone was much more chill."
192,I was in high school at the same time as the movie came out. We had a group of girls who even called themselves ‘the plastics’. They were a group of awful girls.
193,"I was lucky enough that the popular girls at my school weren't nearly as bad as that. They did have their personality flaws, but thst goes for everyone. They weren't mean or bullies."
194,"Had dreams about it as well. My friend bought me some in Scotland (granted, not the right place to get it) and I took a huge bite and immediately hated it. 
I just hate Edwin even more now."
195,Same!
196,"At a party, at a bar, basically any place where singles are known to congregate. Preferably we already have things in common, like we're at a party for a specific sport or event, and preferably we have mutual friends. Not a large chance of me being interested just because someone saw my body alone and went ""ahh, i wanna go talk to that woman based entirely on her appearance."" The conversation is the most important part."
197,The EXTREMELY this sandwich from [Mickey and the Beanstock](https://youtu.be/KqEVYbPw9lI)
198,"I’d be happy if someone just brought me my favorite drink and snack with it. 


If you really want to go all out bring ibuprofen as the pill can cause some women cramps or a headache."
199,A lot of the posters say that they went up a size. Did that happen to you?
200,"I had girls like Regina more in my elementary school years than in my middle school or high school years. I hung out with a group of girls that I thought were my friends when in reality, they were my worst childhood bullies. When we moved on to middle school, I made a nice group of friends and didn’t have to worry about bullying as much as I did before. For high school, I moved and never saw any of those girls again. Fortunately, my high school friends are still my friends, 5 years after graduation."

203,That loaf of bread in Aladdin. It looks so perfect.
204,never had any sort of clique bitchiness in all my years of school. Don’t know if i was just lucky with the year group i was in or if it’s just not as intense/common here in Ireland.
205,"Her K-pop passion, I can stand their songs and her talking about X group because I love her and she deals with my bullshit. I tolerate the fact she doesn't know what to do with her life, we are both young but I hope she'll find her way and will be fulfilled."
206,"See, I felt like guys were a lot meaner in high school than girls were. They made fun of my eyebrows? Hair on my upper lip? My earlobes of all things? Sexually harassed me with taunts about anal sex? 

Girls can be mean, but I didn’t feel unsafe from taunts by them like I did from boys."
207,"One year: I’d have finished my degree a few months prior so hopefully have my foot in the door somewhere in that field. I’d also like to be engaged.

5 years : Married, have had a baby. Be further in my career and possibly bought our house. If not to be very close to buying it.

10 years - To be content, happy family, nice home, enjoying a good job. Just be content.  I don’t want to spend my entire life striving for better than I’ve got. I’d like to reach a comfortable happy life by the time I’m 40 then live the next 40 years just being content with my family."
208,"He's quite messy and a procrastinator. But he is also the sweetest, most supportive man. I have health issues that leave me housebound, yet he manages to see the person I am beyond that.

Compared to what he puts up with, I don't mind having to animate him to do X or Y so it won't cause him problems later. Or having to tidy up mutual rooms more often and finding his glasses/keys/shoes."
209,I was diagnosed in January. You aren't alone!
210,Thank you!
211,No. I tried to mend fences after 2 years but she’s still too demanding
212,They can’t force you to stay there though?
213,"I think about this one a lot — I had a friendship that crashed and burned after I divorced. It was so surprising because she was *there* for me during a bad marriage; I thought our friendship would be even stronger after I left my marriage. (There were other actual reasons but ultimately the friendship died a few months after the divorce papers were signed.)



However, just like any relationship that ended, I try to think of the good — we had 10 great years of friendship. I learned a lot from her. She was a good friend to me, to my family, and she brought wonderful people into my life. We still have some mutual friends on social media so it seems like she’s doing well. She is smart and kind and a good friend to others. I wish her the best. (I wish you the best, L.)"
214,"Not at all. I went to a very small school and most of the kids I grew up with and knew since kindergarten. The most popular girl was the major’s daughter. Very beautiful, had money (most of us didn’t), smart, cheerleader, and the sweetest girl. I’m sure people did get bullied but there was never any mean girl group."
215,"I could *not* get things done efficiently at work when I started a new job with rolling deadlines. I had to sit and plan how I would get things done; I would get easily distracted — I just could not get things done without a tremendous amount of effort. I talked to my counselor about how it seemed like simple things were just so hard to start. She suggested I get tested for ADHD. I went to my primary and she said it seemed like ADD (inattentive) but she wanted me to get evaluated by a psychiatrist. Went to a psychiatrist and she tested me and suggested a med. Tried it and wow — I can sit down and do my work now! 


The testing was, I think, to rule out anxiety vs ADD/ADHD. It was questions about how often you start versus finish tasks, how long things take, how overwhelmed you feel, etc."
216,I know someone who thinks they failed their doctorate defense because the people making the choice didn’t want to give a doctorate to a fat person.
217,Accept the competition and do your best to win ;-)
218,Coraline!
219,Forgetfulness in all aspects possible. I am a very organized person so it doesn’t bother me as much because I can be the one to pack us for vacation or prepare everything.

222,HAH. some fully grown adults still idolize these behaviors and act this way!
223,"The same thing happened at my school, and then they posted pictures of themselves with the book on facebook."
224,"I had to make a rule after I met my best friend's ex bf. Either he or Risk was allowed in my apartment, I didnt care which, but they couldn't both be there at the same time. He did not last long"
225,[removed]
226,"When I was 25 I was hospitalized for suicidal ideations and spent a week in the Adult Psychiatric Unit learning that I had general anxiety disorder and bipolar depression. It was a very very hard week, because not only did I have to address my failing mental health (which had been failing for over half a decade and I *did not realize it*), my fiance at the time proved to be less than desirable during an emergency, and the relationship fell apart 6 months later. 


I went through what I call a ""wild year"" where I had roommate issues, dealt with being medicated for my illnesses and the side effects, mourned the loss of a relationship, and other things that came while recovery from wanting to die. I dealt with it at first in the typical ways (pretty unhealthy) ways; bars, drinking, Tinder-ing, just trying to pass the time and figure it out. It was a hard time. 


About 1.5 years after all this, I got transferred to a different branch of my company, and met a new group of coworkers. These coworkers were much more stable for me. They were ""calmer""; we'd go to the park after our shifts and hang out. We often had dinner together. We hung out together at various apartments and just watched Netflix and ate pizza. I stopped drinking so much, and rejoined the gym. Eventually I moved in with a coworker, and then shortly after that met my now husband. 


I'm 31. Life is still not perfect all the time, but I have finally settled. I am loved and cared for, I have a great group of friends, my family is great, I kickbox 4 days a week, and I see my doctor regularly to deal with my mental health issues. It feels really good."
227,We live with the same situation. My Mom doesn't understand why he doesn't work. I don't mind being the bread winner when he's too ill to take that role.
228,Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
229,You have a strength that many others fail to find.  I wish you every happiness.
230,Cleaning my boyfriend's bathroom. Gross. Figure it is the least I can do because he does all thr maintenance on my vehicles etc. But still gross.
231,"I think unless either of you did or said something particularly heinous, you should give the friendship a second chance and try to work it out. In saying that, I tried to work it out with my best friend of seven years and it went horribly so we're no longer friends. I don't feel regrets because I gave it another chance and I know if I hadn't have tried again, I would've regretted it."
232,This is word for word my life 😂
233,This year I'm going as Summer from Rick &amp; Morty! Super simple and fun.
234,Extremely dry hair. I don't necessarily recommend it 🤣
235,"I'm going as Sappho, the Greek poet of Lesbos. And also, that's my cat's name, so I'm going as a hybrid of the 2 - a cat and a Greek poet. 

The only thing I will not go as, is something ""sexy."" I just don't think it's interesting or fun at this point in my life, and I love Halloween, so I try to put effort into it"
236,"I cut my parents out of my life. 

It was when I was going through grad school and I was financially independent that I had the courage to stick up to my dads abusive bull shit. It’s been so incredibly hard on me but in the end very worth it. I had given my mom an ultimatum to leave him if she wants a relationship with me and it really stung when she chose to stay with him. That was probably the hardest part is feeling so insignificant to an abusive asshole. I overcame it by trying my best to take care of myself. I began to see a therapist, I became closer with my friends, siblings, and boyfriend. At first I was a ball of depression. I would come home everyday and curl up into bed crying but slowly I just worked my way to healing. Luckily after a few years my mom came around and left him so we are slowly building our relationship but it’s like a hole is in my heart that will never be filled because of what I went through."
237,"S
Mom lart youth b'll l

Qq ,"
238,??
239,"It wasn't *fear* but I had no valid excuse to say no and didn't want to be mean or impolite. I was 17 at the time

I went on that date and turned out he was a lot cuter irl. We got married in April"
240,Going through something very similar. I’m 19 and last year was the worst year of my life. I’m slowly slipping back into it again and it’s terrifying
241,"He has ADHD. Sometimes it's difficult for me to deal with, but I know it's even harder for him. As long as he is taking his medication it is absolutely something I'm willing to look past. His medication does not make his ADHD go away  but it does lessen the symptoms a bit. He's an amazing man. I've never met anyone else like him. He's so kind and patient and supportive. He actually expresses his emotions and communicates with me. He's not perfect and some days are harder than others but everything else overshadows his flaws. If he's willing to deal with my flaws I'm willing to deal with his!"
242,I'm glad you stayed strong.
243,"I’m thinking Sabrina, from the Netflix series CAOS. The outfit is so cool and she is too. Seriously if you haven’t watched it yet, go watch it. Then get a white hair wig and dress up as her."
244,BCAAs!! Help so much.
245,She’s a scientist and came from a 6 woman house hold which generally means whenever there’s a decision to be made it takes an extra 10-15 minutes of self debate and analysis paralysis to determine the optimal way to do very simple things like drive from point A to point B. It commonly bugs me because if instead of thinking about how to do X the most efficiently we just started right away it would be done faster. In contrast my faults are tunnel vision. If I have one task or goal I commonly neglect the small details she would consider like clean rooms and such so the faults actually balance each other perfectly.
246,Can you give an example?  I’m having trouble understanding why this is bad.  Unless... this means he’s overly judgmental and expresses that in socially inappropriate situations.  That would be irritating..
247,Does bungee jumping count?
248,"Yeah, they single out anyone who's different.  Kids are monsters."
249,Some women probably do. I'm guessing many don't.
250,"Nope.  And when men emphasize their bulge to draw your eyes there, it's pretty distasteful.  

We've seen dicks before, they aren't that interesting."
251,"I have one of those too.

I live for those rare moments when his face lights up or he says or shows that he feels something truly heartfelt. They are so precious because I know whatever has sparked it must be special and real."
252,I scrolled al the way to see if anyone mentioned this. It looked so golden and hearty!
253,"I'm with you and felt the same. It took about 10 years, but I finally felt like I figured it out and accepted it. I'm easier on myself and my body now and no longer feel bitter about having it."
254,"I adopted a 4 year old, high energy rescue dog. He was in the shelter for 3 months before I got him. He was picked up as a stray in New Mexico, near the Colorado border. There are a lot of ranches and Native American reservations there, and lots of dogs. So no one was interested in a 4 year old. I got him from a shelter in Colorado that imports dogs from other states who have low chances of being adopted. 

The first day I brought him home to my second floor apartment*, I showed him around and then was taking him downstairs to go for a nice walk, and he paused at the stairs. He did not know how to walk down a flight of stairs! 

That night, he fell asleep on the couch with his paw on my chest ♥️

He wasn't potty trained either! It took me 3 months to train a 70 pound 4 year old with the bladder of a 70 pound dog not to pee inside! 

All the training resulted in the best behaved dog ever. People literally stop me in the street and ask me if I trained him myself, how I did it, etc. My secret is Patricia McConnell. Her books are easy reads and not expensive. 

He worships the ground I walk on. 

*I lived in an apartment, but it was right by these trails in Colorado. I wanted a high energy dog bc I was depressed, used to be an avid runner, and hadn't run in months. I had to run this boy 3-8 miles a day to make sure he peed as much as possible outdoors in order to potty train him. 

All the love I get from him is more than I've ever experienced in life and way more than I expected. 

After getting him, I climbed out of my hole enough to seem help from a psychiatrist and psychologist. They have changed my life completely and so had he. 

Best decision I've ever made."
255,Nope that's weird
256,I got my wallet in there but it ripped the pockets. Pockets for women are horrible.
257,He he..... Technically right.... The best kind... We say that all the time as an inside joke in my group all engineers.
258,"My childhood best friend...I knew her since I was around 5 years old, and last time I saw her she asked me to dance at her Quinceañera. That was 5 years ago and every now and then I debate looking her up on facebook but idk. I guess i’m a little insecure because I bet she’s doing well in her life, meanwhile I’m 19 &amp; still struggling to finish high school 🙄"
259,I'm in my 20s and everything is an unexpected struggle ..
260,"I was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour in my foot that means I can't walk and I have had 3 different types of chemotherapy. It caused my depression and anxiety to get really bad, my partner left me, and no pain medications can help my severe nerve pain. 

I now use a wheelchair to get about which gives me independence and I love being able to do things I couldn't before. I am owning my disability. It's taking me a lot longer to complete my bachelor's degree than anticipated due to being so ill but I'm almost done and I'm determined to graduate. I realised my ex was a dick and I'm much better off without him. I use my disability as an opportunity to educate about accessibility and discrimination. I've been on medication that helps my mental health and been going to therapy. Being in hospitals so much has made me want to go into research for biomedical engineering once I finish my degree. 

I could have seen this as a reason to give up and not try, or as an excuse, but it's made me more determined to achieve my goals. It shows people that I may be disabled but I'm more than that and they better not underestimate me."
261,"No, at least not in the same way men do. Many men tend to be creeps about it, LOOKING for cleavage and then staring for prolonged periods of time. 

We don’t go around looking for guys’ bulges. Speaking from personal experience, if I happened to see a guy’s bulge AND I found him attractive, that would be kind of nice. But not hot, not a turn on, not a big deal. I wouldn’t nudge my friends over to look, or try to snap a pic, or whatever. I’d also look away immediately because it’s disrespectful to dwell on it, because he’s not TRYING to show it off to me, it was an accident."
262,The perpetual victim.
263,"TLDR: just do it. Go get tested. It’s not a huge inconvenience and it will make your life better. 

Even though I knew I had the condition, I was very, very nervous. I worried that there would be extensive tests and somehow it would come back that I didn’t have it. I was worried it would take a lot of time away from work and that it would be expensive. I was worried that if I was diagnosed, the medication would take some of my personality or creativity away.  

None of that was true. I started seeing a therapist who had a psychiatrist in the building and I asked her about it. 
I made an appointment with the PSYD and we had about 15 minutes of rapid fire questions about myself. Nothing painful. And at the end, she concluded that I had it and gave me a script. Work performance has increased and I’m no longer making small avoidable mistakes, thus giving me a huge boost in confidence. 

Please, do it for yourself. Do you know anyone who sees a PSYD? I would start from referrals from friends."
264,"I feel like my whole 20s basically were a shit show with the exception of the last year. I will be 30 in a month and hope it turns out better. 

My struggle with depression, working a very stressful full time job while being a single mom. My finances are pretty messy. Somehow I've managed lol"
265,"As far as I know, no woman I’ve come across does."
266,"I graduated college at 21, and by 25 I had everything.  I was married, tenured at my teaching job, and owned my own home that was walking distance from a beach. I was basically set, but I realized I was miserable.  It's really hard to get everything you've worked hard for for YEARS and realize that you don't want it.  My husband and I were both horribly unhappy.  By 27, We quit our jobs, moved back in with my in-laws, lost almost all of our savings since the house didn't sell right away, and basically started over from scratch.   We just last year saved up enough money to get me a car and move out.  It was really hard, and it still is sometimes.  I still don't know what I want to do with my career, since my current job doesn't pay enough to sustain me into my 50s.  But as of right now, it's improving.  I have one year left in my 20s and I hope that things just keep on going."
267,"Early 20s: Severe depression and eating disorder. Therapy and outpatient rehab (basically adult day care, but it worked!) It was an insanely difficult time. I spent most of my early 20s just wanting to die. 

Late 20s: My marriage fell apart by 29, 30. My ex-husband became a very unkind, very unwell, narcissistic emotional abuser. He cheated on me and blamed me for it. The hardest thing I’ve ever done was get a divorce and walk away from that life. I took almost nothing with me but the cat. I’m still recovering from the debt and the trauma. 

But hey, I didn’t die. Either time. :D

We are stronger and more resilient than we know. Now hopefully my 30s are a little kinder."
268,"People (mostly men) constantly questioning my career choices and often making decisions for me (e.g. ""you can't go on that course, we don't take ladies"", or ""when are you planning to have kids?"", or ""you like wasting  your daddy's money?"", or thanking the men in my life personally for MY achievements). Some I was able to push against just by being stubborn, but you can't take on every fight, every time. There are one or two opportunities that I regret missing out on.

Reproductive issues: ""your periods are too long/too short/my contraception isn't working - we don't know why"".. When I asked the professionals what they could do about it, the stock answer was ""well, when you have kids one day these things iron themselves out"". Most of this they were unable to fix, and today I have no trust in the whole field of gynaecology. I am nearing menopause now - was unable to have kids despite trying, either. Thankfully, the biological disasters of reproductive age are soon behind me.

Bad relationship: had a really bad, long relationship in my twenties, and didn't realise until near the end how much I was being used. Had a mental breakdown in my early thirties, received psychiatric treatment, and none of the bad relationships survived the change. Happily married now, no drama, no mental illness relapses for over a decade.

In general, my twenties were a car crash, the thirties were spent fixing the damage, and my forties have been bliss so far."
269,"Nobody will ever care about any attribute of your ""bulge"" as much as you do."
270,My husband and I dressed up as this last year! This year we are doing Tina and Jimmy Jr. We love Bob's Burgers.
271,Cheese is VERY expensive. I've not yet overcome it.
272,"I go to a private high school (15k a year USD) most people are very nice, but there are definitely some people like this. Let's call her Ella, Ella's family own a very prominent resort and are quiet rich. Anyways, this girl constantly talks down on people; sometimes to their faces, and generally acts like she is better than everyone."
273,"I dropped out of uni in my 2nd year at 20 with severe Depression, Bulimia, Anxiety and Alcoholism after not my first suicide attempt. When I came home, I was made homeless by my parents and moved into a hostel (after emergency housing) as it was the only way to effectively get me the help I needed from the limited services available in my area. Mental Health is severely underfunded where I live and you really have to push to get the care you need. Sad, but true. I continued to struggle with what can barely be called a life for the 3 1/2 years I was in that hostel, before finally gaining a permanent home through the council, where a year later my next door neighbour raped me. He still lives next door to me, and I reported it to the police the night it happened. It was a traumatic, drawn out and painful process. These things just don't work out a lot of the time.   


Anyway, I'm now 28, engaged to my ""one"", and 39 weeks pregnant with my first child that I have always dreamed of. I'm also sober since October 2016, and have been on an extraordinary journey to better mental health. I have continued educating myself online from home, not in my original uni course but in small things that interest me and could be useful in a future career. My first step was to stop being a victim, forgive myself for the choices I made at the time and start recognising things I could actually change, instead of wallowing and indulging myself in the things I couldn't. There's many, MANY more steps, but that was by far the first important one. I would be remiss if I didn't mention letting go of ideals and beliefs that either weren't mine to begin with, or I realised didn't serve me any more. That involved  non judgementally accepting that my church upbringing wasn't true to myself, and that expectations I'd put on myself as a child/teenager were unrealistic and, in some cases, toxic. I will never regret things that I experienced, because everything served a purpose in the end and I am hugely proud of where I am, who I am, and what I can do today. It's easier to weather new storms when you can see a lesson in all the chaos you came from."
274,"When I was 23, I was on a study abroad trip and my step dad (the only real dad I've ever known really) died. My fiance and my mom didn't want to tell me so they didn't talk to me the whole time I was gone. 

When I got home, i learned he basically died from negligence from doctors who didn't treat a seizure disorder he had. He died in the apartment across from me. My mom didn't tell me until the next morning. 

It was my final semester of college and I just stopped trying. I had good enough grades, but I still regret giving up and not pushing to get a higher gpa.

To this day, I'm terrified and get panic attacks when someone won't tell me what's going on because I think someone's died and no one is telling me."
275,I follow a jeweler on instagram and she does these very simple silver rings with fingerprints. Like you are wearing a ring with your partner's fingerprint and they wear a ring with yours. I really like the idea and if I am ever getting married I'd love one of those.
276,"i just started my 20s and im currently struggling with the idea of future and present , what will it be ? am i wasting my time with what i am doing?"
277,No.
278,"I have a pair of 90's mum jeans that can fit a purse, or a bottle of water"
279,Nope.
280,My mum used to dress up as Morticia for fun. She loved her so much she just started dressing like her. Took me a while to figure out that wasn't normal mum behaviour
281,"Yup and yup.  Bungee jumping, sky diving, white water rafting, rock/ice climbing, canyoning, caving, cave diving.  Why?  I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie."
282,"Different apple varieties have different textures. You seem to prefer crisp, harder fruits so look for gala, Granny Smith, and honeycrisps."
283,Idk it’s so annoying! I am nice if you talk to me but other than that I have my headphones in and don’t talk. No guy will understand the annoyance of being hit on at the gym haha
284,"More general: actors and other celebrities who have harassed or assaulted people should never work again. 

More specific: Armie Hammer is incredibly boring to look at. He is white bread if white bread was a person."
285,Same. I think this was the benefit of going to a school with more people in it. If you fell out with one group you could probably join another. By the time we got to year 13 there were so many overlaps due to our friend groups being all mixed up in our classes. I had my main group I sat with but was good friends with two other groups and would often leave mine to go sit and talk with someone in another.
286,"I just met HIM.  
It was at work. We both got there early and we found out we knew a little French, so we started by chatting in French. It all progressed when I gave him a textbook.   


I'm 36 and he's 39. We've both never been married and we now plan on marrying each other. He has an adorable 2 year old son I will get to call my stepson. Life is good. I was on here making a throwaway not so long ago thinking I would never be able to marry or have kids. Lightning struck HARD and here I am, planning when he will meet my family and loving life.  


It's doable."
287,I went to high school in the area that Mean girls was trying to mimic. It’s supposed to be the North Shore. Northern suburbs of Chicago like Evanston and Wilmette. It is accurate to New Trier high school.
288,Channing Tatum is ugly
289,I bought a succulent to put on my night stand a few weeks ago and taking care of it has honestly made my anxiety easier to deal with for some reason
290,Middle school was awful with mean girls and guys. All the hormones and little impulse control.  High school was fine.
291,"Usually the wealthiest dont need to brag 
Also very very high end brands are discreet and only other wealthy can notice it"

293,"I'm 30 now, but I've been living with my parents again since I was about 27 I think? I moved back to get a little help with anxiety, and then stayed while my Mum was sick to help Dad care for her.

I think if I hadn't I'd have many more regrets after my mother passed regarding time lost, though there were definite stressors that arose as a result of living back at home, like you do still very much get relegated to the child category.

I'm not sure my presence is still helping, as I'm staying for a bit so Dad isn't alone, and it is definitely impacting my sanity a little because I seem to just be irritating him. But then, I also like being in the space my mother lived in so... Kind of feels worth it I suppose?"
294,"Not common at all in my school. I went to a small private school (70-100 students per grade) starting at age 10, and there, nobody was ever mean to anyone's face, but they'd be savage behind their backs. Still, with so few classmates and just 35-50 girls in each grade, we all knew that it'd be a mistake to make enemies with people we'd have to see every day until graduation."
295,OMG yes
296,Beyonce is overrated
297,Smoothies. I buy frozen berries(all types)and throw them into the blender. I have a hard time eating veggies so I buy a greens supplement that I add into the fruit smooth.
298,the fact that people have sex
299,"This! I grew up very wealthy and bragging/brands are the last thing on my mind. I find the classiest things in antique stores because honestly, that’s where it’s at. I moved to the west side of my state 3 years ago and most people here obsess over status and what they have. Eventually, I noticed what you just said. It comes from a place of insecurity and self esteem. It’s sad"

301,Seance
302,"I feel you. Gym bros are my worst nightmare. Sometimes we get shirtless gym bros in my gym (pool is on the same floor, and for some reason, that makes them think being shirtless in the gym makes it okay) and they leave puddles of sweat on every machine they touch. Such a joy to be around people like that."
303,"People who have an enormous ego but are actually lazy, pathetic and just simply fail to see it. This guy from my study (and my ex roommate) didn't do shit for his study, skipped tests with bullshit excuses, copy pasted work from others and didn't do shit in group projects. He went to a therapist cause he couldn't deal with his gf breaking up with him (he still didn't realize that she did this because he's a narcissistic prick) and used that to still pass his year (personal circumstances).

305,"I could never relate to these movies that show high school as like some social ladder. I went to the biggest high school in my state (3.5k students) and everyone just their own thing - nobody cared about what you did. So I'm sure there might have been girls like Regina but only in personality, lol."
306,Hypocrisy
307,"Little late but my middle school had people like that, very popular and shitty always in drama. My first high school I went to was also like that and I'm glad I left for ""the nerd school"". It was very small so we were mostly pretty close, no one tolerated bullying and all the stereotypical popular kids were considered outcasts and most people weren't close friends with them."

It affected my sanity... Well, there's a reason it was only 8 months."
320,ive certainly heard its branding thing for him

326,"Little bit of lip gloss, concealer for my uneven complexion, mascara. Maybe small amount of blush."
327,"It’s amazing to me that people like that don’t *choose to control themselves*, it’s as if they think it’s ok to rage, just because it’s a game."
328,"Totally! And FTR I'm a very forgiving person. But when you call my friend ""the most judgemental person I've ever met"" after once judging me for putting three sugars in my coffee, you have passed an event horizon!!!! (COWORKERS.)"
329,We’re lucky if we can even fit our phones into our pockets.
330,"I got diagnosed at 19 and I'm just 25. My symptoms were shark week only came around every 6-9 months. Was so scared as a teenager to even tell my mum. It is a pain being on the pill because I had a bad reaction to one type i was on and I got super emotional so easily which is never me. 

It's so common though! Since I've been open about having it I've had friends and colleagues tell me they know at least 1 person with it with completely different symptoms to mine."
331,Nope. I would be curious to see if anyone did.

340,You looking for something other than sexism?
341,What does that stand for?
342,A cheese plate? Let me just work five extra shifts and sell my panties.
343,"Yes! I'm totally comfortable to be as strange as I want to be around my bestie, and vice versa. There's no secrets between us. It's so nice to have someone that I can talk to about anything without worrying that she'll think less of me."
344,"My middle school was pretty brutal. Some experiences that stand out...

1) At sleepover parties, we'd sit in a circle and one girl would sit in the middle. Then we go around and each say what we didn't like about the person. If it was especially brutal, the girl in the middle would end up going in the closet and crying. And if you were one of her ""best friends,"" you were supposed to go in the closet and comfort her. This was called The Bitch Game. And ""best friends"" changed often.  

2) The popular girl cycled through best friends and at one point, I was her best friend for a few months (6th grade). She decided we needed to get boyfriends. I had always had a crush on this one boy. And it just so happened that she liked his best friend. We made it known that we liked them, and they asked us out on a double date. Shortly after her ""boyfriend"" broke up with her, and she told me that I needed to break up with mine too. I made the egregious mistake of not doing so because I really liked my ""boyfriend."" The rest of my year was hell. She told all of my other friends that they weren't allowed to be friends with me or even talk to me anymore. She also got another girl to steal my boyfriend lol by hanging out at his locker every day and like bullying him into going out with her. Funny enough, years later we both had switched schools, and I dated him for real in high school. But man, middle school was traumatic. Way more stories..."
345,"My twenties were an emotional rollercoaster. I almost saw it as puberty part 2 but on the mental level. 

Every emotion was intensified ten fold; love, hate, jealousy, compassion. Many breakdowns but at 30, I feel balanced so I guess my brain just had to balance out chemically with time."
346,"Tbh i dont really know im very sick of relationships and i dont see a point, theyre all trash anyway. But i guess mine would be video games?

especially cod, fortnite, pubg. I think theyre all a wate of time and pretty boring but im not gonna tell them to stop, even if they do it 24/7 and completely forget about me (happening rn in my current lol)"
347,"None at all, unless I have a big presentation in which I might do concealer foundation, eyebrow pencil and mascara"
348,"Best: strong and feel great, boost my self esteem 

Worst: man arms which look fat even though they’re muscular. Sleeves are tight in dresses."
349,"Saying something nicely doesn't mean lying about it. You clearly don't understand what tact is, if you think it means lies and condescension.

An example would be if someone brought in cookies they made to work, and they gave you one, but it didn't taste very good. The tactful thing to do is to say thank you, and just not eat the rest of it if you don't like it, but not make a big deal about it. The ""brutally honest"" asshole move would be to tell them it's gross, and make a fuss about them being a horrible baker.

Or, ya know, if someone has started learning a new skill, and shows off the basic things they've learned to do. Telling someone who has been doing aerials for two months to quit their day job and join Cirque would be a lie. Telling them that the three things they can do look great isn't a lie, because everyone knows that beginners are judged on their progress, not judged by being compared to seasoned professionals. And it's not condescending, either--it's very important and useful to judge progress! The ""brutally honest"" thing would be to say something like ""Why are you showing me this, no one would pay to see you perform, I don't care about your hobby"".

Curtness, fyi, literally means ""rudely brief"", so either you're using the wrong word or you *do* know that you're not being nice."

Its definitely things like this that make us wake up and realize how precious good health is."

355,My partner brought home KRAFT prepackaged cheese one time and I’ll never get over it
356,"A folded up bill, and _maybe_ my airpods."
357,"Compared to others struggles on here, mine seems somewhat easier to get thru but..

My partner of 4 years ended our relationship out of the blue and started seeing someone else.

I had nothing except our little family, we rented and only ended up having a month to get out, had a cat that I refused to allow him to take, I'd moved over an hour away to be with him so my family ties were damaged. After being skint for our whole relationship, I had shared everything with him. We shared white goods, electronics and even the car. 

Honestly, overcoming this had started 2 years ago, when I started to feel completely unloved by him. I stayed because I thought our financial and living situation was straining our relationship, that we weren't the issue. Seems he had different ideas, as he distanced himself from me completely. I see a therapist so would always discuss this with her, I think I actually mourned our lost relationship before it was even over. 

I moved in with my cousin, close enough to drive to work and closer to my parents. 
I refuse to give up my job, even though it's in my old town, I feel stronger with that familiarity. Living with my cousin is hard but we are managing, I am saving like crazy to buy my own home. Until then, I'm just happy living day to day, i finally realise he made the best decision when he ended it. Also, fixing that relationship with my family, i should have never felt lonely, they were here the whole time."
358,LOL
359,"Depression! 
I knew I had it since I was 17. It got really bad at 18, went away and came back so much worse at 19-20 when I was in college.
I cried so much and I felt so lonely. I had no friends, was failing all of my classes, started self-harming a lot and I gained a lot of weight."

361,"Once living on my own, I never expected to be sitting on the toilet with no toilet paper. Took a few times of sitting on the toilet with NOTHING to make sure I bought some every time I went to the store."
362,"At 21 my father died, and I had to arrange everything by myself. That same year my grandma passed, and I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. Now, at 23 I got out of a 7 year relationship and lost the dog we had together. All of these things have taken a very hard toll on my mental health, but i'm trying to push through. I'm learning what it's like to be on my own, and its tiring"
363,"I wasn't expecting to do some deep therapy work for my depression, anxiety, OCD, and depersonalization disorder but it changed my life. I had to rewire a decade of past traumas and thinking. Now I'm 23 and feel like a ""normal"" 20-something who is just living their life without worrying about whether or not I want to walk in front of a car today."
364,It’s still problematic because now that would mean (from their perspective) it’s okay for women to commit sexual assault as long as she’s attractive
365,"I was sexually assaulted when I was just out of high school by one of my old schoolmates. I was so scared that I didn't say no or fight it, I was more so frozen and blacked out, next thing I knew I was bent over a chair doing things I wanted no part of. Not knowing what exactly it was that happened, I opened up to individuals years later and I was told that it was ""rape"", I'll never say that that's what happened because I didn't fight or say no. I never talked to my schoolmate again and honestly, I doubt he even realizes that it was so horrible for me, I wish I could go back in time to yell at him or push him off me, but since I didn't, I feel that if I brought it up to anyone who could do anything, I'd be seen as one of those girls looking for my ""5 minutes of fame"" and he has so much money that he'd get off without anything. I wish it was easier to decipher between sexual assault and rape, but as well as other people understanding the severity it causes on the victims psyche."
366,This is a huge one. I've read *so many* stories on /r/sex about people assaulting others because the person consented to something in the past &amp; the assailant assumed that meant they had consent for the future. Not the case at all!

368,"I'm 31 now, and looking back at my 20s is wild.

At 21, I was diagnosed with Grave's Disease, which is a genetic autoimmune condition that causes hyperthyroidism. It kicked in so suddenly, and practically overnight I went from an overweight yet otherwise normal college student to someone who couldn't stand for more than a few minutes before my blood pressure went nuts and I fainted. I ended up losing over 50 pounds in two months. I spent the spring break of my senior year of college in the hospital because I went into a thyroid storm. After I graduated, I had my thyroid ablated with radioactive iodine (apparently the largest dose that hospital had ever made for thyroid ablation), and a few years later I had my thyroid removed entirely. It took about five years to finally get the hypothyroidism that resulted from ablation and removal under control, and even now my body's response to artificial thyroid hormone is thrown off by the smallest things. I now weigh 100 pounds more than I did at 21, as well.

My late 20s were a rollercoaster as well. I never expected to get married and then get divorced before my second wedding anniversary. I then didn't expect to fall in love again and get married a second time (although I was 30 when the wedding happened).

An honorable mention is how long it took me to get through grad school. I started grad school just before my 22nd birthday, but didn't graduate until 26 because I ended up having to pay my own way through and taking classes as I could afford them while I worked full time. Most of my friends went full-time and were done within two years of college graduation while I kept schlepping on year after year."

370,"Medusa: get a pack of plastic snakes from the dollar store and hot glue them to hair clips.

Sally from *The Nightmare Before Christmas*: wigs are fun :)"
371,"Sorry, but what is this toxic mindset?"
372,"And see, here I said they just didn't taste very good to you, and you jumped straight to them being honestly horrible. 

Yeah, if there is something fucked up with it, you can say ""These taste kind of off"" and ask if maybe it's a new recipe or they screwed something up. But just because you don't personally like how something tastes doesn't mean that the person is a horrible baker. I hate almond horns and biscotti, I think they're all pretty gross, but clearly lots of Italians like them and I'm not going to call someone a horrible baker just because they made something that I subjectively don't like. If they ask for feedback, I'll honestly tell them I'm not a fan of biscotti and therefore can't judge them, unless there is something objectively wrong with them like they're burned or used salt instead of sugar.

Again, you seem to be not understanding how you can be honest *without* being *brutal*, and are assuming that anyone who isn't being brutal must be lying, when that isn't true. 

I, too, ask for honest criticism when I cook and bake. But the difference is that I *ask* for it. If someone just brings in a gift to share and doesn't ask for it, it's not your job to criticize them. Part of being tactful that you might be missing out on is to only give your negative opinions when asked for your opinion. Doesn't mean you have to lie. That's something you could try to change to be less off-putting, if you actually want to change. Tact isn't just about *what* you say (although that definitely matters), but when and how.

Again, you're the one who called yourself brutal, not nice, and off-putting, so yeah, I'm assuming you are those things, or that at the very least, you are forcing your negative opinions on people at times when your opinion wasn't asked for and doesn't matter except to hurt them. It could just be that you're a little self-centered and are overvaluing the importance of your ""criticism"". I have definitely run in to a lot of people like that."
373,It isn't just something that happens to young women. Victims can be any age or gender.
374,This was very well put. It’s sad that women have to go through this crap.

377,"When I was 20, the man I loved the most died.  (Side note, at the time of this comment, the amount of upvotes this post has is ""his number"" so that's kinda freaky) 

We were on again/off again.  It's hard to explain the relationship as it was far more complicated than it needed to be.  He had another chick in another city, but was still calling me.  Not for hookups or anything, because he only seemed to want to talk to me. 

Anyway, he died in his sleep unexpectedly and my 20s were a mess as a result of it.  I'm still working to overcome it fully, because I don't know it's something you ever truly get over.  I was insufferable the first couple of years, but as time went on and I started to really evaluate our relationship and how he treated me as a girlfriend, the hurt of the loss seemed to be less overwhelming.  I got in relationships again, I spent a lot of time with friends, burned the candle at both ends really, but just kept myself engaged in the world around me.  It's been nearly fifteen years and there are still some days where the hurt is so heavy that it's hard to get out of bed in the morning, but I think it's safe to say that I survived. 

Learning to make this experience just be part of my story instead of defining me as a person was a big part of that survival.  To some of our mutual friends, they still think of me as his girl.  And for those people, that's fine.  But newer friends don't even know about him unless it comes up and I think that's important.  Not that I'm trying to erase it or anything, it's just not the most important thing about me."
378,"That's totally me. When I was 18 my dad died a year and a half after cancer diagnosis, after my gradma died my junior year. Uncle died 3 days after my dad and 2 more uncles the next couple years during my own cancer scare and a 80 weight gain due to a tumor. I was talking to my best friend about how there will always be a before and after. Not even about getting better it's just about learning to be resilient and carrying on."
379,The goddamned patriarchy
380,Ican relate! It feels surreal hearing it from a Dr. Hope you're doing well!
381,YES! This is 100% true.
382,That BMW was a British company
383,"I have been meaning to check that movie out for many, many years.  Perhaps I should."
384,Very well put. Im sorry you have no support around you and I really hope you get better.
385,I give him scalp rubs :) He also loves kisses! And we watch animal videos together because he adores them.
386,"So, in other words *objectification, stupidity, ignorance, and se ism?"
387,"That preventing it = potential victims doing x, y, z things.

No, preventing it = making perpetrators not perpetrate in the first place."

In a pinch, I usually go for the Loreal Elvive if i need to get drugstore"
391,Trying to figure out taxes and insurance and how not to get taken advantage of in legal paperwork and leases
392,"Sadly, it seems like a lot of men have been saying they **want** to be sexually assaulted by women, because apparently it makes them feel wanted. It’s disgusting but I have legitimately seen men *complaining* that they’ve never been sexually harassed / assaulted."
393,"Here. 
Home paid off. Higher title at work. More travelled. But otherwise here."
394,"We've known each ofher for 22 years, she knows things about me my own husband abs blood relatives with probably never know. I can call her up at any time of day and she'll drop everything to talk or promise to call me back and always will. We text at least 50 times a day back and forth and in 20+ years of knowing her I bet there's maybe 200 days where we haven't spoken in some capicity."
395,"Lost myself, and not in a good way. Things from my childhood, which i thought didn't affect me, started haunting me. Grades went from bad to worse. Got serious emotional crisis, anxiety and depression. Haven't hold onto a job for a year now, so i am broke. I used to be one of those people who had things figured out, i always had my months planned ahead of me, had 5 yrs and 10 yrs goals. Right now, i don't know what will do in a month, or in a year. I hope i will be alive for 5 yrs."
396,"I'm in my 20s now. I got groomed by a violent psychopath who ended up assaulting me. Fortunately, that was the first assault, and it completely undid my brainwashing. Now I'm dealing with a criminal court case and praying it doesn't go to trial. While I didn't expect to ever deal with this, he didn't expect to get arrested and charged for it, nor did he expect me to be completely free of his brainwashing afterwards, so there's that."
397,"My long-term casual partner (ethically nonmonogamous here) is late to everything, all the time. I also have ADD, so I get it (though I'm not nearly as bad with it as he is), and it doesn't bother me the way that it bothers other people."
398,"Thank you. Ive been seeing a counsellor throughout and she's been absolutely wonderful. Thank you for mentioning ptsd, I had a google just now and never even realised it could affect cancer patients but having a read it does make so much sense. I hope you're doing well ♥"
399,"but if she wants to have sex why is that looked down upon? men always talk about how horny they are, why can’t a woman want to have sex too?"
400,3/4 of my phone
401,Oooh alcoholic donuts sound lush.
402,"So my group of friends were the Craft girls (we were the outcasts who listened to heavier music, played guitar, etc.) and the mean girls were the Mean Girls.  We had a dumb little monthly newspaper/newsletter thing that was mostly written by students, and the Mean Girls went as far as writing a story about my group of friends being ""witches who were trying to cast spells on popular people to make them nerds.""

That was the closest thing to a burn book that happened."
403,That it’s a good thing because it apparently gives you a feeling of being “desired” or “wanted”. The amount of men saying that they want to be sexually assaulted by a woman is utterly disgusting
404,"Ah yes! I only know this by the technical name, the drain hair catcher thingie. Very useful!"
405,"You are absolutely right!! The leather bag look just isn't a look anyway, we'll have beautiful skin until we're ancient haha"
406,"I slept with a guy (he initiated it and asked to come home with me on a night out) he'd always been really nice to me before, I didn't really fancy him it was a get your rocks off for the both of us. A textbook one night stand.

Now, after we had done the deed he told me not to say anything because ""People at work will laugh at me for sleeping with you"" (I'd managed to get a bit of a rep because I'm a girl who likes sex, so it was ""embarrassing"" for him to have gone there). I was really insulted, I'm not a fucking dirty secret.

Everyone at work figured it out any way, *they'd seen him leave with me and heard him ask to come back with me*. This girl who I was friends with at the time asked me about the rumours and I confirmed them. She laughed and high fived me.

A few months later they wind up in a relationship, turns out she'd been banging him whilst with her boyfriend. They'd been sleeping together when he came home with me. She had done a 180 when they got together and started bitching about what a slut I was and how I couldn't be trusted because she had told me she liked him (she hadnt)

She managed to persuade some newbies of my horror. He tried to get me fired by saying I had had sex while at work. They made life hell for me for months, the refusal to help me at work, the blatant not looking in my direction when I was at work. The constant rumours and shit. I met my boyfriend there and they bitched about me to him all the time, constantly trying to get him to leave me.

Thankfully they left, wankers"

410,Thanks for sharing OP! It was a great read.
411,"I've been known to do this a few times. Last time was in my college dorm, it was an awful time in my life and I just grabbed scissors, bent over the trashcan and started snipping away while kind of giggling. My roommates got a little weirded out. I hated it and had to go get it fixed. I haven't done it again since, I like my hair too much."
412,"I started the job during college, so I was already employed when I finished."
