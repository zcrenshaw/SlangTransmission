1,"This isn’t exactly an adjective, but when a man is alone in charge of his children he’s “babysitting” but when a woman is alone with her children she’s just being a mom. "
2,"Not sure if this is what you’re asking but here is my experience. I had (still have I guess but we live far away from each other now) a friend who considered me her absolute closest friend, while she was pretty far down my list so to speak, even though I hate the idea of ranking friends. I’ve just been really fortune and had a lot of good friends in my life a long time (15+ years and always good to each other) so no one was ever going to really come in and change it.
 
I would find myself getting annoyed because anything I did she had to do too and I’m very independent and like to have my own thing. Everything that was my thing was becoming her thing.  Also as bad as this sounds I found her incredibly boring. I struggled to focus when she talked. One day I stepped back and had a mirror shatter moment and realized I was being the bad guy. I’m too nice to ever be flat out mean to someone but I realized she was being a good friend to me and I was just kind of brushing her off and never giving close to the same back because I didn’t feel like I had room in my life for her. Which was so stupid because when you meet good people who only bring good intentions you shouldn’t turn them away. 

Whenever I had a bad day at work she would plan a girls night and pick up champagne and fancy cupcakes from a bakery downtown. She always offered to drive if we were going out for drinks. She was sincerely always good to me. Once this hit me I started to try to give some of that back. She was lonely and just wanted a friend. I asked her to go to movies so I didn’t have to worry about struggling for conversation for an extended period of time. I made a big deal about her birthday.  

I’ve come to really love this person because as I’ve gotten older I’ve learned the importance of always making room for good hearted people. They feel fewer and far between with age, maybe because I don’t get out as much or people are busy starting their own families now. Either way, I realized it was stupid to be annoyed by someone who just wanted a friend and was an EXCELLENT friend in return just because we didn’t have the natural chemistry I had with other people in my life. 


edit: Line breaks, I was just typing out my thoughts on my phone earlier and not thinking about formatting or expecting this to really get any attention. Thank you for the gold and thank you to everyone who had such nice words.  I really needed them today and they're so appreciated.  "

4,"That romance movie moment you're waiting for, the love at first sight feeling? It'll probably never happen. And no guy is perfect - constant scrutiny is stopping you from letting yourself fall in love."
5,My dad told me that all men cheat and that I’ll just have to get used to it
6,"I've written about him before, but in the final years of our relationship, my ex-husband was radicalized by the internet. 

Once, he'd arranged a ""ladies night"" for me with the wives of some of his friends. I didn't really want to go, because I didn't have much in common with these women, but it was important to him, so I did. I ended up having a great time! There were some other women there as well, who were mothers. At the end of the night, I was gushing about how much I enjoyed spending time with women, and how much I appreciated him doing this for me. He lost his shit because he felt that by enjoying hanging out with women who had procreated, I'd somehow betrayed his childfree ideals. He went on a totally toxic rant about how women shouldn't be allowed to leave the house once they have kids etc, etc, etc.

Right at the end, we were going on a ""trying to save our marriage"" road trip. He started ranting about how he wished he'd been born a woman, so he wouldn't have to work or suffer or try. He could just ""ride the cock carousel"" and live off the generosity of men. Women have it so easy, he felt! Why would any of us try to have a career, or accomplish anything? Doesn't it just make more sense for us to use our sexual wiles to live like parasites off of men? This is why, he explained, he couldn't respect me as a feminist. Because men totally had it harder, and to claim otherwise was completely unfair. 

And honestly, that was one of the last straws. If he sincerely felt that was a realistic portrayal of the lived experience of women -- that we were handed everything on silver platters by ""betas"" who waned into our pants? He didn't see me as a person. He didn't respect me. Our marriage was firmly, completely, dead. "
7,"Worn out underwear. 

I can vibe with a nice crisp Calvin logo peeking out from the top of your jeans. I can handle a cargo short, whatever. Crocs, eh, I'm not offended.

But when your low rise pants are exposing ratty ass, stained, torn up old underwear that your mom bought you for Christmas when you were 12, it's a no from me dawg. "
8,"Ripley from the Alien franchise, the trauma came after she was already an established badass.  "
9,Two days in retail. I hate when jobs lie about the position and it turns out your job relies on opening credit cards.
10,"Hysterical- it's the OG sexist slur, rooted in the Ancient Greek idea that female insanity was due to her womb roaming around her body and causing chaos. "
11,"The problem is you.  You don't talk to them, you just fantasize about them and then moan to me about how you're going to die alone. You don't go out, you won't sit at a bar, you won't go join a club or go to meetups.  You refuse to try online dating because it's ""weird."" 

You're so shy that you won't even talk around men most of the time unless I'm there to help you (and I live several states away now, so how can I help you?). 

I give you ideas that fit within your realm of ""do-ability"" and you make excuses for why you can't or why you're not comfortable with that.

Lady, no one ever caught fish by sitting in their house by the fireplace, wrapped in blankets.  Go out.  Talk.  Leap, for fuck's sake, just ONCE.  

And if you're not going to do that, then stop whining about it because at this point, I can't help you when you won't even help yourself."
12,"No jerk is good enough in bed to make up for being a jerk.

**No jerk is good enough in bed to make up for being a jerk.**

That lesson took me way too long to learn."
13,"""Catty"". Women can dislike each other or disagree with each other without being ""catty"". "
14,"I quit a job after about a week and made my sister quit too. I was 16 and she must have been 14. We were paid under the table for helping a guy who ran carnival games and bounce houses, etc. We got out first envelope of cash and were paid better than we expected but he also invited most of the girls and none of the boys via a invitation to a “good worker” party at his house. 

I quit, said my sister was quitting too, and I let her help and take on some of the babysitting jobs I had the summer."
15,"Fucking a this one. I’m a guy and I hate this soooooo much. Ohhhh special day with daddy?  No idiot we are just having breakfast before school, ya know, normal parent shit. "
16,"I was a police officer in the army. Had a woman tell me her husband was sexually assaulting her on her sleep. She’d wake up to him performing various acts in her and she didn’t want it. 


I later heard my supervisor laughing about the case, saying “that’s not assault; I call that foreplay”. My respect for the guy drastically changed after that"
17,"The two minute rule! Someone mentioned it in a Reddit comment and I gave it a whirl and it is seriously life changing. 

The rule— if it takes less than two minutes to do, just do it. Scoop the litter, put the dishes in the dishwasher, pull that weed. Putting it off will make them add up and seem daunting, and personally make them even less pleasant to do. I’d rather spend 2 minutes here and there vs an entire day of little chores."
18,"A side chick is the one he only see's at night, never takes her out in public, only texts while he's at work.

You are the side chick.

I actually told her that and we had a huge fight.  From then on I kept my mouth shut and am aghast when she tells me he won't make it official. "
19,"Half my family are born again Christians, but it surprised the hell out of me when my Aunt said, ""I'm lucky your uncle lets me leave the house to work, most women aren't that fortunate.""

What. The. Fuck."
20,"""Hormonal"" is used to describe women who aren't just happily going along with whatever is happening around them.

Nevermind the fact that hormones dictate pretty much every aspect of human life, regardless of gender and sex. But I've never heard a man be described as ""hormonal."""
21,Good blackout curtains in my bedroom.  Room now is pitch black at night and I fall asleep much faster.
22,"Anything with a Confederate Flag on it, or that says ""Git Er Done."""
23,"In uni I took a job at a pub behind the bar and on the first day, I walked in, started prepping and the owner called me into his office to say I could earn extra if I was ""nice"" to him after my shift. I laughed and said something like ""in your fucking dreams"", followed by a string of expletives, then left. 

About 20 minutes, I think."
24,"Girl, you need to move out of your parents' house. You can't keep complaining that they ""won't let you."" You're in your late 30's, you've been working full time since you graduated from university, you have the means to move out. You are just extremely codependent. That is not attractive. "
25,"Waking up earlier than I need to. Like if I have class at 9 am, I'll get up at 6:30 and have a nice, slow, relaxing morning. I get to make myself breakfast and coffee, get to sit down and review my homework or watch some TV, do my makeup, pick out a cute outfit, and maybe get some laundry or cleaning done. It makes me feel like my life is way more put together! It's amazing what a few quiet hours in the morning can do for your mental wellbeing. I just feel a lot better now than when I used to sleep through my alarms until the very last minute and rush out the door with 15 minutes before class, looking and feeling like a mess... I think this is just a part of growing up and becoming responsible though. I've changed so drastically from high school to now, age 21, and I'm so excited to see how else I'll change throughout my 20s."
26,"Almost all of the women from Avatar the Last Airbender are like this. Toph, Azula, and Katara are badass, but also have drastically different personalties and circumstances.  One could argue that Azula's dad mentally abused her by putting her through such strict training, but he didn't do it because she's female, but because she's the firstborn child and a prodigy."
27,"Anytime a woman raises her voice she is ""screaming""."
28,"This is extra sad, not just because that implies he cheated on your mother and thought it was fine to do so... But aren't dads supposed to be protective of their daughter's? Like this is the total opposite of the whole annoyingly sexist yet sort of understandable ""hurt my daughter and I've got a shotgun and an alibi"" thing, and I still find it even more offensive. "
29,"I was hired at California Tortilla for a min wage job back in 2000. Their policy for making burritos was that they wanted everyone to be able to memorize the menu and be able to make each burrito from memory, without looking at a list of directions. They told me not to come back until I had the menu memorized, and I just never went back because memorizing a menu by heart for minimum wage wasn't worth the effort to me."
30,"I got an alarm clock that gradually lights up as it gets closer to your wake-up time- it does make noise if you don't deactivate it by that time, but the idea is for your body to be mostly awake by that point anyway so it's less startling.  They're not for everyone, I know some people that won't get up unless it's the loudest, most obnoxious alarm sound ever, but sudden noises freak me right the hell out and it's really nice starting my day without having a mini heart attack."
31,"3 months. 

I worked in a call center, making survey calls to the US. I was 18 and very, very sheltered. Had to make a call to residents of Las Vegas about their opinion on road reparations. I get this guy on the phone and start my spiel “Hi my name is Alice Vega (fake name) from X Surveys, I was wondering if you could give me your opinion...” and suddenly the guy explodes with expletives and threats of sexual violence. 

Now, in this job we couldn’t ever hang up, nor stop trying to get the other person to answer the survey so the call was something like “Please sir, your local government needs your opinions...” “WELL I NEED YOU TO CHOKE ON MY DICK, IM GONNA FIND YOU AND SLIT YOUR THROAT AND FUCK THE HOLE” “sir we just need to know if the work on repairing x street” “AND I NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE SO I CAN KILL YOU” etc etc

In the end I hung up and ran to the bathroom to cry. At the time, I had never heard anybody say anything even close to that and I was pretty shook. A couple of minutes later I hear a knock on the door. It’s my supervisor. He wanted to let me know that he was listening to the call... and told me off for hanging up. Also my “bathroom minutes” were up for the day so get back to my chair. 

And so that day I quit"
32,"I've always enjoyed sex but the older I get, the less I see it as a performance. It's been interesting to just focus on whether or not I'm having a good time, rather than thinking about what my face looks like and if my bum is jiggling in a weird way or the angle makes my tits look odd, etc.  "
33,"""I hate to say it, because I would miss you terribly, but I think you need to move to a bigger city, somewhere that has liberal, atheist women for you to date. This podunk town has nothing to offer you in terms of romance."""
34,"Anytime we're being passionate or excited, we're dramatic."
35,"One day at McDonalds, during training I got a phone call with a job offer for double the wage. Byeeeeee"
36,"The amount of sex you have in a relationship isn't necessarily an indicator of how much you're attracted to one another or how healthy the relationship is.

Both my husband and I have average libidos. We've been married a year, together for four, and we have sex maybe once a week.  I used to get insecure because I'd read about couples having sex every day, or every other day, and wonder if my relationship was defective.  I worried about this especially since we had sex daily for the first four months of our relationship and it tapered off after that.  

But it's okay!!!  If you're having fun and good sex, and you're happy with how much you're having it, it doesn't matter how often it happens.  It doesn't mean your husband isn't attracted to you if he's not nudging you with his boner every single night before bed.  It doesn't mean you're not attracted to your husband if you'd rather spend a Friday night playing video games instead of having sex. 
 He's human, and so are you.  You get tired, you get busy, or you're just not in the mood.  That's okay.

It took me a good year to accept that, and a lot of conversations with my husband.  I'm in a good place now.  I'm not counting the days in between the times we have sex and wondering if going 8 days without means he doesn't want me anymore.  If you're happy and he's happy, that's what matters - not marking off days on a calendar."
37,Sleeping with married men isn't going to land them a boyfriend. (And definitely not a faithful husband!)
38,"Word. My BIL is a single dad (his wife died) and he gets so much guff for taking kiddo to events full of moms. He's always having to explain no its not a special day, I'm her parent, her only parent, and I am parenting. 

I'm actually pretty down on mommy centric anything since my sister died. Parenting communities can be really sexist! "
39,"You're single because you're the most self centered person in this hemisphere and everyone can smell that from a mile away. The reason nice men won't date you is because no self respecting person would voluntarily sign up to be furniture in your life. The only people who want to date you are people as self centered as you are, who are so self absorbed they don't even notice how self obsessed you are. "

41,"Brooklyn 99 is a really clean, funny show!"
42,"Not sure if people actually wear these anymore, but those Ed Hardy esque shirts never looked good to me. "
43,"8 hours. I was hired as a project leader. As my boss was introducing me to the staff, nobody knew I had being hired. First red flag. Everyone looked miserable. Second red flag. The office I was given hadn't been sorted and cleaned (there was tampons and pads in the drawers) and, had no windows and was the size of a closet. Third red flag. My boss told me before leaving that they have decided to not raise my salary after all. I  wouldn't be making more than my previous job. Fourth red flag. 

I spent the lunch break crying and when I  left at 5 pm, I said to my boss I wouldn't be back tomorrow. 

After I explained why, he said he would ""ruin my reputation and my name"". Fifth red flag. 

Good riddance. His threats didn't have any impacts. "
44,Emotional. I hear it all the time in the medical world. 
45,"You should show up now like.
I think I finally got it. "
46,"Every night for six months my partner and I exchanged gratitudes. We would tell each other things that we were grateful for that day and it changed my entire life. I started noticing more things to be grateful for that I took for granted previously, I starting looking at life in a more positive light, it brought me and my partner closer, and overall made me appreciate life more. I suggest this to so many people in my life because it had such a profound effect on me and my life. When I was having an especially bad day, this practice helped ease that negativity by helping me realize that my day wasn’t so bad and that even on the hardest days, things were still pretty good. "
47,"My bff is doing this same thing. Been 'together' for 8 months. Shes never been to his house (flatmate issues allegedly), been out in public with him, he frequently cancels on her, shes never met his friends and family and she has literally only ever seen him in the dark usually after midnight and he leaves before the sun rises.

I told her that obviously he is MARRIED or partnered at least but she tells me I dont understand and that he says he has never felt this 'connection' before. 

Stupidest thing Ive ever heard of coming from a woman I thought wasnt. Ridiculous. "
48,"Katniss Everdeen (the book version) obviously she was from a poor upbringing, but seriously in the first book she was an incredible woman. She knew she didn’t have the nursing skills that her mother and sister had, so instead she worked on her other skills, she became a skilled hunter, so she could provide for her family. She volunteered to take her sisters place because she knew she had a better chance of survival, and when she wasn’t having the attention she deserved (at her skill test) she got their attention in the only way she knew how.

Also Okoye from Black Panther, she kicked major arse in that film. When the men laughed at her, she proved her skills. She was willing to stand in front of a giant war rhino to stop a fight, she didn’t even care that her boyfriend was on the other team, she stuck to her guns and stayed on the side of T’Challa because she knew what was right."
49,"First day at Tim Horton's. It was alongside a main highway going from the small towns to a state capital. They started me off during the morning rush, no training. Just gave me a headset and put me in front of the drive thru register. I was doing all right until someone ordered something new and I couldn't find it on the register. Another girl shoved me out of the way because I was taking too long and I fell right on my ass. Finished the shift, got two free donuts, and never went back."
50,"A guy I was seeing told me that only men should drive, not women. (This was in the United States, not Saudi Arabia.) I ended it with him.  "
51,"You make yourself and your dates miserable because you're always too afraid to say what's on your mind, afraid to argue, afraid to express any anger or disappointment, or any opinion or value of yours that doesn't completely match theirs. Then you spend the rest of your time ruminating about secret hurts, harboring resentments, and reliving conversations in your mind. If you were just yourself, the worst that could happen is two of you disagree and discover that you're not suited for one another. As it is, you're always pretending to be who you think the other person wants you to be, and the results are always going to be disappointing for you both."
52,"In specific contexts, yes. The evidence is that both men and women interrupt women more, and that tends to be what I observe. 

Using the person's name is a good way to get the interrupter to stop talking. In a team environment, calling someone on interrupting someone else is more effective than calling them on interrupting you (you'll probably be perceived as a... well, a gendered term applied to women who are outspoken and not sufficiently nice... if you tell someone they interrupted you, but if you say, ""hey Brad, Jenn wasn't finished"" you won't have the same problem).

55,"It actually doesn't happen that much to me, even though I'm pretty soft-spoken and overall not an imposing presence. 


When it does happen, it's usually a person who interrupts people in general as a habit. Most likely to be a man, but some of my mom's female friends also do this. Depending on the situation, I'll:

* let it go: if what I was saying wasn't that important, if I know the person I'm talking to respects me, or if I don't have the energy for confrontation
* keep talking while they're interrupting me: if I'm feeling argumentative and stubborn, if the person consistently makes a habit of interrupting, or if I don't care what they think of me
* after they're finished, say, ""Going back to what I was saying..."": if it does matter what they think of me but I need to get my point across"

57,"My work is kind of a “boys club,” I’m the only woman on a management team of 6 men. I’ve known several of these guys since high school and I consider them good friends. A few days ago a customer came up behind me while I was on a ladder and he tickled me and wrapped his arms around my waist. I FREAKED OUT. I don’t want to be tickled by anyone, let alone strange old men. I was so surprised when I told the guys what happened that they all thought it was no big deal and I was overreacting because he “didn’t mean it like that.” It’s a small example, but it just showed me how ingrained sexism can be.

63,"If you haven't seen it already, The Good Place is a really entertaining, light hearted show. It has a female protagonist, but no sexual assault scenes. 

Edit: People in the comments have pointed out that there was one scene that may be disturbing. But imo it was in a flashback and was only used to highlight the protagonist's attitude to it. The show itself is very wholesome and has no other disturbing elements "
64,"My dad once said women's purpose had always been to look pleading for men in response to my sister not wanting to wear a fancy dress or some shit.

He defended me from my mom's weird-ass gender enforcement as best as he could so this was really painful to hear coming from him. 

I also don't think he thinks of me as a woman, really."
65,"Usually my favorite movie comes to mind with any of these ""favorite"" questions. And I gotta say, hell yeah, Mona Lisa Vito from *My Cousin Vinny* was amazing. Love her.

Maybe Elle in *Legally Blonde,* lol.

Also, Stephen King is really good at writing women. Many of them are abused, and that's probably largely because he's a horror writer. But his female leads tend to be really badass. *Rose Madder* is my favorite, and Beverly from *It,* but they both have tragic stories."
66,What the hell? Why would he arrange a ladies night for you and then get upset about the fact that you enjoyed it? What did he expect? 
67,"When I was in high school, I had a crush on a boy. He told me ""If you ever want anyone to like you, you need to wear makeup every day,a nd wear skirts and dresses more often."" 

I went to my dad (who was, at that point, my only parent), heartbroken and furious. ""This is such crap! Can you believe this dude who thinks I should change for him??"" 

My dad looked me up and down: ""Nah. He's right. And you probably should lose some weight, too."" 

I was baffled. ""Shouldn't I wait for someone who will love me for who I am?"" 

Dad replied ""Oh, honey, no. Men are all about packaging."" 

There were lots of weird and disappointing misogynist moments from my dad, but that was the one that hurt the most. And when I brought it up again recently (almost 20 years later), he was like ""... yes? I stand by that? I don't understand what is wrong with my view?"
68,"A coworker - ""Why do you feel the need to leave at 5? I put in MY time and stay till 9 or 10 every day""

Me - ""my contract says 9-5, my work is done in a timely fashion, and I am exempt from over time."" 

She later reported me for the one time i left 3 minutes early to catch an earlier train because my dog was sick. I already cleared it with my boss.."
69,"You’re right. He cheated on her for about a decade. It’s just awful and honestly I could only laugh at him. It’s awful how delusional you can be. Blaming anything and anyone for your mistakes, just not yourself.

My brother is an amazing example for the opposite. He’d never do that. Same as many more guys I know. I guess I’m lucky to have many good examples in my life, otherwise I would’ve just believed him."
70,"Okay YES. However I work retail and had to work the day they were pulling my grandmother off of life support. It felt so good to tell an asshole customer that very thing when he told me, ""Come on, smile! Life can't be that bad.""

73,"I don't have a general item in particular - but if my husband's tattered 15 year old Punisher t-shirt he got from Universal Studios pre-marriage would just somehow disappear from reality I'd probably be ecstatic.

Edit:  Oh it's totally the tattered part and not the image as we are both comic nerds.  And when I mean tattered..... the bottom half is nothing but random holes in various sizes, the upper half has a giant hole over the right nipple, and the back looks like rats gnawed on it.  Yet.... he still insists on keeping it instead of letting me finish it's transformation into a set of dish rags. I've tried finding him another, but no luck.  I actually bought it for him and maybe he's attached some sentimentality to it, but it's really time to let go.  "
74,It does happen.   Met my soulmate when we were both 20 and stupid.   Loved him all 46 years of our marriage.   He died of pancreatic cancer on Good Friday.   Miss him like crazy.  In the beginning we had horrendous fights and amazing love.  The love only got stronger.

80,"When at a family get together there was a political debate that started with some family. I stated my views and opinions on the topic, and my dad interjected that the only reason I had those views was because they were the same views my boyfriend had.

81,"He expected me to hang out with his friends' wives, who were all childless, and enjoy it. That would have been fine.

The fact that other women were invited, and they had procreated, and I enjoyed their company... unhinged him. It wasn't even like the kids were there (well, one woman's husband did swing by briefly with the baby so she could breastfeed the kid, but it was like 15 min).

89,"Maybe an hour?

I had applied for a part time telemarketing job (I know, I know, but it was just prior to the holidays and I could’ve used the extra money).  I already had a great paying serving job on the weekends so was just looking for something that I could do on my off days.

Anyway, I have a phone interview and it goes well so I am asked to come in for a real interview.  I show up and get ushered into a large room filled with other people.  I still don’t actually know what the product is at this point...

The other people all look as surprised as I am to see everyone else. We are given a spiel about how great this place is.  Blah, blah, blah.

We are shown around and moved to another big room where all sorts of forms are on the table.  We are asked to fill out the forms and before starting to fill anything in I read them over first.  They were asking for contact info and my SIN (SSN for Canadians).  So I don’t start filling out the forms and it’s immediately noticed by.  I get asked why not and I so I think I’m in the wrong place and that I’m there for an interview.  We are told we all have the job and that in place it’s easier to get the job than it is to keep the job.

Keep in mind I still don’t actually know anything about this company and I’m not giving my personal info to a stranger.  I state this and am told that I’m already being paid for today and that’s why they need this info.  I reply that I don’t even know who is hiring me.  At this point the person who is ‘interviewing’ all of us is getting mad at me so I picked up my bag and walked out.  

It just felt weird..."

Between my father and the circumstances I went through during that time I became convinced it was entirely my fault and I was inviting bad treatment by behaving badly to get attention.

It continued when I moved back home and that became my ""normal"".  

My father was well respected and an ""upstanding member of society"" so by the time I left I figured no one would believe me anyway so I just tried to fade from view as much as possible from anyone anywhere.

I've never really been someone's 'best friend', except in school but that friendship was toxic and she only used me to get what she wanted, so that doesn't really count... It sucks.

I have my SO, who's my true best friend and that's wonderful of course, but I wish I didn't feel like a 'second-tier' friend to everyone else.

I find the term quite dismissive issues women might be seeking an outlet for by talking/complaining about.

In a similar vein, ""gossiping"" seems to be an activity only attributed to women. In fact, I've had male friends flat out tell me that they don't want to associate themselves with those sort of """"""trivialities"""""" and threw that quote about small minds talking about people in my face, even though they spend their fair share of time shit-talking people within our friend circle.

The premise of the book was boys will be boys. It had one chapter about how men would never only be thinking of you when having sex due to porn and past experiences. It really fucked me up and essentially drove me to the mindset that if boys are going to have sex why should I miss out in all the fun lol.

She died in January, and she'd phoned me a few days before to try and talk, but my phone had been on silent so it had gone to voicemail, and she'd left me one a ""Hi, I rang you!"" voicemail. I deleted it when I finally checked my voicemail, told myself I'd call her back the next day, and woke up the next morning to a phone call telling me she was dead.

I really would just like to hear her voice again, even if all she was saying was that she called me and it didn't pick up. I don't have any videos or recordings of her, I shouldn't have deleted that voicemail."
135,"Honestly - having a lot of open conversations with my husband.  One of the things he helped me to realize is that I had some ingrained beliefs about men and their sex drives because of the way society portrays men.  That is, men are ALWAYS down to fuck.  When my husband wouldn't be in the mood or would be too tired, I'd take it as a personal sleight - not that he doesn't want to have sex, but he doesn't wanna have sex with ME.

And I helped him realize that society really places pressure on women, too - to be WANTED all the time.  If a woman's acting sexy, and a man says ""not in the mood right now babe,"" women are kind of societally conditioned to think there's something wrong with them (because, again, men clearly wanna fuck 24/7).  It's pressure that goes both ways and it sucks.

I'll be honest and admit that some of these conversations were really tearful on my part.  I thought he didn't want me anymore.  He explained that the pressure to be Always Ready For Sex is too much for a lot of guys, including him, and that it's not that he didn't want me sexually - he just didn't feel like it at that particular moment.  

And you're right - sometimes I didn't know (and still don't!) if I want to have sex, or just want to feel sexy and like my husband finds me sexy.  When I'm feeling this way, I've learned to just say so.  And then even if one or both of us isn't in the mood, we'll still make out, he'll grab my butt, let me feel his boner, whatever.  

This probably isn't helpful at all!  But I guess I've just learned (1) my husband doesn't have to be ""on"" all the time and it's silly to think that he should be and (2) you can feel intimate and sexy with one another without having sex.  And my husband has learned that sometimes all I need is for him to grab my titty and call me sexy, or whatever, not a full-blown bang session.

So: bottom line is that we had a ton of really open conversations to get to this point!"

I have younger siblings in high school and the trend I always see is:

1. Guy is an all around shitty boyfriend, humiliates her, or breaks up with her in a really shitty way
2. Girlfriend has a completely valid emotional response which can (understandably) include anger, crying, etc. 
3. Girlfriend gets called a “psychotic bitch”. "
138,"Last time it happened I just kept speaking over him loudly: ""Frank you're interrupting, I'm still speaking.... Haven't stopped yet .. I'm still going... You're interrupting me"". It worked :-D"
139,"He was a police commissioner. Double my size and obviously trained in holding someone down. Trying to fight back was pointless, I literally couldn’t move.

Because of his strength and technique I had no bruises or anything like that. Therefore, no evidence.

Also, it was consensual the first few times that night. It was just the last time that I said no, begged him not to and told him to get off. He didn’t listen until I went stiff and just cried. He thought it was some rape roleplay kink.

Now let’s be real, who the fuck would’ve believed a drunk school drop out over a highly respected cop? Especially when there was consent beforehand.

Edit: Damn. Thank you all so much. I’m so touched by the fact you’d believe me. This means a lot!"
140,"when i started to notice one of my closest friends constantly interrupting me. maybe it was just an ego thing and not a sexist thing, but i never noticed him do it around our other guy friend. like he would just talk over me until i eventually gave up and stopped so he could make his points.

Yeah...that's probably why women don't want to date you. Why on earth would they? Who wants to date someone who seemingly places ""asshole"" as their most important defining characteristic? "
144,"Honestly, this sounds like solid advice. I think this is a problem with some people. They assume that since they're so interested in another person, that even if they don't outwardly show any signs of interest, the other person somehow knows. And since the other party doesn't know about that person's feelings, they doesn't approach them (even if they might otherwise). The person sees this as a rejection of their feelings and then complains about being unwanted."

146,It's not just me?  It's really not just me?  I felt like I was losing my mind every time my ex would tell me that I was screaming at him when I thought I was just using a sightly more firm tone than usual.  He had me convinced that I actually didn't know how loud I was being.

He snorted and said ""that's dumb, who cares if he takes the condom off? They were having sex anyway. People just look for any excuse to regret sex these days.""

I knew he had some annoying views towards women but that was the first time he actually said anything like that in my presence, to my face, and it just made me feel so sick to my stomach.

Disclaimer: I know stealthing also happens in non cis het relationships as well, didn't mean to exclude those from the issue, just talking about how this specific convo went."
151,"This is a disturbing trend I see everywhere and it's as if no one sees this double standard. No matter what traumatic situation, physical ailments and crazy situations a woman has/is going through: her reactions are only explained as hormones or mental disorders or over reactions.


I mean think about it. A man has a hard day at work  construction and his back is killing him, he's angry and feeling unwell. But people understand and write it off as him having a hard time and it's completely normal for him to feel bad about being pain.


Next situation: A woman has blood dripping out her body, she has to insert objects inside her or wear bulky pads while worrying about leakage. Her organs are literally contracting inside of her body and causing headaches and nausea and pain throughout her body. She is not happy because of this and what reason do people say she isn't in a good mood? Hormones. Her hormones are just making her emotional and she's not thinking straight. WTF?? 


And this is also applied to pregnancy, childbirth, post-birth (along with having a new human and pain of breastfeeding), menopause, etc. Despite all of the physical pain they are going through, the reason they are acting different is just hormones. (not denying actual hormones aren't in play, but you all know what I'm talking about). 


How come war veterans coming back from traumatic trips aren't written off as emotional when they are not in good moods? Think about it...sorry this was long, I'm just mad at the world. "
152,"In high school, my buddy and I decided that we would spend the summer working as laborers on a farm.  We showed up at a small local farm (central MA) and applied with the owner.  The job involved planting seeds, or saplings, every three feet or so and moving along the row on my hands and knees, and basically crawling and planting little saplings all day.  

He said, ""Yeah, I mean, I'll hire you two, but I don't really need you and I don't know why you would want to do this.  See those Vietnamese women out there? They will work circles around you and they don't take breaks.   It pays $6 an hour.   Good luck.""

This happened outside the US.

My partners niece was abused when she was eight. This is two years ago.

This little girl told her Mom. They went to the police.  

It was eight year old girl vs adult male. One word against the other.

The police and the specialists they work with put so much time and effort into her case. Interviewing her multiple times over six months. Doing everything they could to make her feel comfortable. At one point they took her around police stables during an interview because she likes horses.  Multiple teams of police child psychologists worked with her.

They did all this until they had a case which, put simply said : this child has either fooled teams of experts, or the one denying it is lying.

It took the judge ten minutes to lock the guy up.

That’s how it should be. Always.

190,"Ok this isn't a word, but more of something I have noticed being a ""young"" woman in corporate.

High fives

I get fucking high fived more times than not and it makes it SO WEIRD! I notice the men will shake hands but when it comes to some sort of ""physical"" greeting, why do I get high fived? 

You could attribute it to me being more young looking rather than my gender, but from my observation, it's more my gender. I feel it reinforces the same thing when women are referred to as ""girls"". Its less professional and juvenile, what makes you think I can't handle a handshake????"

He also wasn't successful in raping me, he had ""only"" forced me into a closet with him and forcibly kissed me and stuck his hand up my skirt. So I didn't think there was anything worth reporting anyway.

Now she is married to a different guy, and they recently had a baby. While she was pregnant I couldn't help but think, what if someone did to you what you did to that poor woman?

While discussing a barter-based economy he said “I should be able to trade a week’s worth of groceries for the grocer to be able to have sex with my wife if I want to.” At 9 I realized something was pretty wrong with that sentiment and that it had to do with who owned the things being traded, but I couldn’t really vocalize it.

I’m in sales so there’s a lot of egos in the room and my boss is this bad ass and she will just keep talking if someone try’s to interrupt when she’s not done. Not say “I’m not done talking” but literally keep talking. I’ve seen her go sentences when someone tries to challenge that too and I’ve never seen that fail her.

I got scammed out of $125 by Books-a-Million for a similar job requirement. A friend worked there and if they didn’t get 3 people a month to sign up for a free magazine trial they got written up and after 3 write ups got fired. My friend was 1 sign up short so I signed up for him so he didn’t get in trouble. 3 months later when the trials up, my credit card gets hit for $125. The sign up didn’t ask for a payment method, but I paid at Books-a-Million with my credit card. The store gave them my payment information.

He was their family’s primary breadwinner. I felt like I was putting my best friend in poverty had I reported him. We moved out of state soon after, so it became a non-issue, at least for me. 

Many years later, he tried to get custody of his granddaughter bc his daughter (my best friend) had become a drug addict. She wasn’t exactly well-equipped for parenting at the time, but I know for sure that he was an opportunistic pedophile and did not have the child’s interests in mind. 

I wrote a letter to the judge in the custody case explaining what had happened so many years ago. I don’t know if the letter had anything to do with it, but he did not get custody. There’s also a statute of limitations, so there’s not much I can do at this point. Don’t know where he is, but I’m sure he’s still running around out there looking for little girls to ejaculate on.

292,Haha I keep hearing about this but I feel like it'd ruin my sleep cycle because it'll be pitch black in the morning and I'll just sleep half the day away. I started leaving my blinds wide open and the light helps me wake up.
293,"All the fucking time. If it happens once or twice, I'll just stare daggers into the person like ""bitch I'm talking"". If it keeps happening I'll just walk away from the person.

295,Donna Noble anyone?
296,Was working on a construction site once hammering in some nails and a guy came up and said “oh you know how to use a hammer” in a extremely surprised way. It’s not actually hard to hammer things even though I am a lady. 
297,"Right? I always think about how they’d feel if I said something like “I just found out I have cancer.” Like I don’t, so I get it would be awful to say, but I want them to realize I have my own shit to deal with and I’m not here for decoration. "

299,"I had a major case of *cool girl syndrome* in parts of undergrad and high school.

I felt really duped by sex positivity tbh. I was really naive at the time and dealing with the sexual harassment that’s so ubiquitous in American high schools. It pressured me to be sexually available to men in an environment where I was being pressured to be sexually available to men. 

I had trouble saying no, especially when guys were nice to me, I feel like I owed people with my body when they didn’t abuse me. 

While I think the extreme place I took it had a lot more to do with a personal history of abuse and being in deep denial about being a lesbian. That being said, a lot of girls have boundary issues when they’re young and sexual harassment is imo pervasive being gay might be an outlier but having a rough young adulthood where I was abused by men isn’t uncommon. 

It turns out, when I changed my perspective from sex being about what *other people expected from me* towards what *i wanted and found enjoyable* I started doing and wanting totally different things. I even found out I didn’t really like men at all, I was just so fixated on male approval, I never thought about what I even liked or wanted or even my pleasure really. 

I guess the absolute best advice I have is that casual sex is stupid as a young woman not because of some moralizing crap, but because it’s dangerous for and I doubt it’s very enjoyable for a lot of the people that participate. You can have sex outside of a relationship, but I’ll never tell young women to have sex with strangers or on a whim. Female socialization makes us eager to please, I just caution women without a lot of sexual experience to take a step back and really think about why they want to do what they want to do. Perhaps you’ll avoid the trauma I or a lot of my friends at the time didn’t get to. 

You can be badass, down and fun without sharing your body. Cool girls know that men aren’t shit and won’t push their sexual boundaries. Sex isn’t the time to compromise on what makes you feel safe and valued, it’s a crucial part of the experience. 

Édit: big thanks for the gold ahhhh!!!! It’s my first time!! "
300,"In the movies, there are no two women who talk to each other. It fails the Bechdel test about as hard as you can."
301,"I had an in person interview to be a nanny that went well, so I was asked to watch the kids for a trial run of 2 hours while the mom went food shopping. Towards the end of that time I sat the kids at the table to color and have a snack and that’s when I saw  it - stacks of Scientology textbooks, workbooks, papers about the dangers of vaccinations, how chiropractors can cure illnesses. 

The mom came home and I booked it out of there. She offered me the job later but I responded my needs had changed and turned it down. I was **so freaked out**. This was middle class metro NYC suburbs, who the fuck thought there were actual scientologists out there? "

305,"Female. In certain contexts, that is. 

It’s an adjective, not a noun.  I hate being referred to as “a female.”  I also hate it when it is unnecessarily put in front of, say, an occupation when the conversation doesn’t warrant it.  (Example: “a female doctor” instead of just “a doctor”)"
306,"Something similar. 

They tried to get me to work third shift (10-6am) and then come in for second shift (2-10pm) saying that I would have 8 hours off between and that was plenty of time. 

Now another employer is stressing that working 5 12 hour days for 5 weeks won't be a big deal. Yeah no. "
307,"When in a conflict, I look for how they react. Are they only talking about their feelings and how you hurt them, etc? Or are they trying to reach a mutual conclusion and REALLY listening to you? 

In conflicts, I try to share my side, then ask the other person if that's accurate. Let them explain their side, ask questions if I'm confused, but never blame guilt trip. Active listening is so important."
308,"OP answered too, but I had a similar routine when I was in a deep depression. I was super broke but said fuck it, I wasn’t sure I’d make it a month, and withdrew 31 $1 bills. I took two jars and drew a :) on one and a :( on the other. At the end of the day, the only thing I had to do to put the bill in the :) was think of *one good thing* that happened that day.

The first few weeks was about 50/50, but at the end of every day I’d see those singles and not want to give my $1 to the :( jar. I would start noticing good things during my day to remember for later, when ordinarily, I wouldn’t have bothered.

It was such a small, almost insignificant change to my day, but it worked where a lot of things hadn’t in empowering me to begin feeling like I had control over how I perceived the world. I still have depression, but my therapist (where all the :) eventually went to pay for) congratulated me in finding a way to break my depressive rumination cycle that worked for me. It let me have room to say that a day was horrible but there was still something good in it, which was something that I didn’t find in other strategies.

I hope everyone finds a habit that can help them as much as this one helped me.

309,"You mean a friend who is *unhappily* single? She might need to hear that the common denominator in all her failed relationships was her, so instead of trying to change everyone she dates maybe she should see what she needs to change in herself.

311,I hate when people refer to women as nagging. Just do your fucking job/share of chores/basic responsibilities without me asking you to like a child and I wouldn't nag. 
312,"I worked for three weeks at Target and quit. I hated it so much that I would literally cry the night before a shift. This was back in college, a few years ago, and I was trying to save up money to buy a car. Since I didn't have a car, I couldn't work nights, as I had no transportation, and I was extremely upfront about that. In my first interview, I told them that I wouldn't be able to work past 7, until I got a car, and the interviewer told me that would be fine. In my second and *third* interview, the same thing. Finally, I was hired, and they put me in the women's clothing section. Well, they didn't tell me that working the women's section also meant you had to answer and transfer phone calls, cover the men's, baby's, and electronic sections, *and* cover for cashiers, too. They literally only told me that I would be assisting people in the dressing room, putting clothes away, and then folding clothes out on the floor. Yeah, no.

Look, I love Target, but working there was absolutely ridiculous. They would only schedule 2 or 3 cashiers at a time, so half of my day was covering for them, but then if I was at the registers for too long, I'd get in trouble for not doing ""my own"" job, even though that was part of my job. I was also only trained one day on the registers, when I had never worked on registers in my life, so I was very slow, and barely knew what I was doing. The register manager would get mad at me if I took too long, even though he knew it was only my second/third/fourth time working at a register.

Then, I kept getting scheduled on nights. Every five days, I had to call the guy who made the schedules, and tell him that I couldn't work nights, which the managers knew. After the third week of me working there, he finally said, ""listen, I need people for night shifts. I don't know why they hired you if you can't work nights. You're either going to have to find coverage or quit, because I'm not going to keep changing people's schedules."" I quit right after he said that."
313,"This same thing happened between my grandfather and I. I am a liberal, he is a republican. Something was on the tv about Trump and I said something (respectfully) against him. He blew up and said that ever since I moved down south, the 'liberal' educational system brainwashed me. I pointed out that politics are never spoken about during class, even in US History. Facts are presented about both sides but agendas were never pushed by my instructors and they never even disclosed their party affiliation. "

316,"Bubbly, it’s a passive aggressive description that makes me feel like a child. I dislike when men or older generations comment on my bubbly personality.

Loss is a part of life.  Get used to that, learn to walk away from things that don't work for you, don't serve.  Don't get married and give up your plans simply because you don't see any other way to stay with him.

321,"One of my best friends from a wealthy family and is pretty well off herself, and also wanted an expensive, fancy wedding. This could have been a nightmare, but wasn't because she is an absolute delight. 

She was both an extremely organized and extremely laid back bride in the planning process, so her maid of honour had a super easy time throwing all of the traditional wedding stuff (eg. Bachelorette). She insisted on paying for all of the bridesmaids dresses because she felt that it wasn't fair to make us buy them since they were dresses that she specifically wanted. She chose beautiful dresses so everyone in her party looked fantastic. On the actual wedding day she arranged for all of us to get food throughout the day so we weren't passing out by the time we got to the ceremony. And best of all, she was obviously so genuinely happy that we were all there and told us repeatedly.

The whole experience served to reaffirm why I'm still friends with her after all these years despite us being from very different socioeconomic backgrounds. 

TL;DR: The bride is extremely nice and generous. Not the most exciting story but it was the best!

322,"2 days. I got hired at Chipotle. No one showed up to train me. At 23 I was older than all of the employees, manager included. I was informed that you don't get breaks ever. I spent an hour sitting on the dang salad spinner because the lid broke. I have a disabled hand but they decided I needed to be on prep and constantly handling knives and then berate me for doing it too slowly? I have knife skills but come on, I can't move as fast as someone with a functional hand.


I had also repeatedly said I was only available friday through sunday and unable to work more than 20 hours a week as I was a full time student and had another, better paying office job during the week. So of course I was placed on the schedule for multiple 8 hour weekday shifts....

So after my first weekend I texted the manager saying I was too busy with school and never went back. I don't even go in that Chipotle as a customer."

Whipped especially bothers me, because it feels like my husband is being emasculated for doing something kind or thoughtful for me, and then [even though it's a concept voiced by men to insult other men] it's somehow twisted as though I'm the one doing the emasculating. 

Both words imply that women can't express frustration or receive pampering/thoughtful gestures in a relationship without it negatively reflecting on her, the man, or both. "
334,"Nakia (I had to IMDB it), seriously though, Marvel women are generally pretty empowering, but Black Panther really got it right, there wasn’t a single main female character in that film that didn’t kick major butt. They were all warriors and scientists, when faced with a choice between a man or sticking up for themselves they all chose themselves, also props to Marvel for actually giving them armour that reflected the country without being sexy, and when the armour wasn’t very protective the men had the same thing on.

335,"I grew up in an Assemblies of God church. We had this banquet thing called [True Love Waits.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Love_Waits) Boys and girls attended and I got a simple silver band to wear on my left hand ring finger and pledged to keep myself pure until marriage. This wasn’t really much of a pledge because I was 12 at the time. I mean, very little risk of me becoming impure at that age. There was also this month long youth group class thing that went along with it. Honestly, I didn’t pay much attention because I always spent all my time at church drawing my surroundings. I basically went to the banquet because it was super important to my parents and gave them a false sense of security. 

I mean, once I actually lost my virginity, I did have to overcome the panic of not being pure anymore (because this thought and idea was taught to me from infancy). And it took me a decent amount of time to reprogram myself into having a healthy view of sex and all that comes with it. But eventually I stopped having nightmares from all the internal turmoil that I was indoctrinated into and was able to see how absolutely messed up all that shame and guilt that Christianity puts upon people. "
336,"For the bachelorette party we rented a lakehouse and just chilled out for a weekend. We took turns cooking and went to a brewery and on a short hike. I went fishing off the dock and caught like 100 fish.

The wedding was a Klingon wedding at a really pretty lakeside venue with a glass pavilion. We chose our own dresses and mine fit off the rack so cost me less than $50. 

The bride, an art teacher, made us jewelry and hair ornaments. She was very well organized and calm, even when the officiant forgot to come and was an hour late. We were more than happy to do anything to help!

The groom is from Togo and they wore traditional Togolese outfits and did a choreographed flash mob style Azonto dance. His family choreographed their own dance to traditional Togolese music and that was really cool. 

The food was excellent BBQ with all the dishes renamed after Star Trek foods."
337,"I was the main chick. I met his friends and family a month into the relationship. We hung out almost 3-4 times a week. I slept over a lot. I met the side chick when i stopped by unannounced. She was bragging about how little she cared that he was cheating on us both. I asked her if she ever met his parents to see how deep the lie went. Her attitude shifted and she says, ""you met his parents?"" Then she got mean and started honing in on me. ""Why are you crying? Women like you are the reason i only hang out with guys. You're too emotional and an embarrassment to our gender."" My ex stood their the entire time and didn't say anything. She left first but not before kissing him and saying i love you. "
338,"People assume you're ""safe"" so they tell you things, tend to be friendlier.  You aren't viewed as a threat so you're treated as such.   People tend to trust you more I guess?

You're expected to just know when people's birthdays are, be good at decorating, have good handwriting, and be neat.   Not all of those are true, but they are expected.  Emotional labor, holy shit.  Everyone puts their emotional labor off on you, especially men.  If you resist, some of them really take it personally that you don't want to mother them.  


Good manners, you're expected to hide your bodily functions more than men.  Women, in my experience, tend to be a lot more polite than men. "
339,"Woooww, yeah. I can't imagine dating someone who by their late 30s has never bothered to move out of their parent's house and start an independent life. That doesn't even register as a human adult to me. They're basically a talking potato at that point as far as I'm concerned."

379,"I research etymologies in my spare time and [wrote up a whole post](https://uselessetymology.com/2018/01/17/the-etymology-of-hysteria/) about this that went into the history of the word in relation to medical science and the ""Wandering Womb."" Here's a segment from it in case of interest: 

…

“Hysteric” and “hysterical” were the most common uses when it surfaced in English in the very early 1600s from the Latin *hystericus*, or “of the womb,” which in turn came from the Greek *hysterikos*, meaning either “of the womb” or “suffering in the womb,” and the base noun *hystera*, or “womb” (i.e., uterus).

The medical Latin term “hysteria” was used to diagnose neuroses that were almost entirely specific to women—and that were believed to be caused by the uterus. Over the centuries, its perplexingly vast array of symptoms included heartburn, vertigo, headaches, choking, depression, poor attention span, jealousy, problems with the veins in the nose, anxiety, and death, among many others. (In the mid-19th century, the American physician George Miller Beard cataloged [75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria](https://archive.org/details/39002011127108.med.yale.edu/page/n3), a list he claimed was still incomplete.)

The notion of hysteria as the cause of pretty much anything that could ever be wrong with a woman is attributed to Hippocratic-era Greek medical teachings about the oddly disturbing theory of the [“Wandering Womb,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_womb) which suggested that many diseases women suffered from were caused by the uterus moving of its own accord — and I’m not talking about a little bit of shifting here. Just to illustrate how far-fetched this concept seems today, here’s an /r/badwomensanatomy-worthy description of the Wandering Womb theory by the 2nd-century physician Aretaeus:

&gt;In the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb, a female viscus, closely resembling an animal; for it is moved of itself hither and thither in the flanks, also upwards in a direct line to below the cartilage of the thorax, and also obliquely to the right or to the left, either to the liver or the spleen, and it likewise is subject to prolapsus downwards, and in a word, it is altogether erratic. It delights also in fragrant smells, and advances towards them; and it has an aversion to fetid smells, and flees from them; and, on the whole, the womb is like an animal within an animal.

Despite the fact that more widely-renowned Greek physicians including Galen understood that this was absolute balderdash, the concept of the Wandering Womb and its ties to hysteria remained a plague on the medical field for centuries, lingering like a bad case of chlamydia almost until the Enlightenment.

Another humorous theory about hysteria was that it was caused by the retention of “female semen,” which was thought to be stored in the uterus and to mingle with male semen during sex. If female semen wasn’t exposed to male semen often enough — said the primarily male physicians of the time — stored female semen could become venomous, which is why hysteria was believed to be particularly common among widows (to the extent that it was sometimes known as “the widow’s disease”).

By the mid- to late 19th century, hysteria referred almost exclusively to what we consider sexual dysfunction (but only among women), and treatment often involved doctors inducing orgasms in their patients. For science.

While more orgasms probably did go a long way toward helping many sexually-repressed women of the day, attributing so many ailments — psychological and otherwise — to the mysteries of the uterus was (obviously) problematic because it necessarily reduced hundreds of diseases to what was ostensibly “the lady crazies.”

Not until Sigmund Freud (influenced by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot) published several articles on hysteria in the 1890s were stress-related symptoms of that nature widely attributed to psychological causes. Further developments in this area, as well as the nuances of psychology as a whole, were prompted not only by advances in gynecology and an increasing number of women in the medical field, but also by the study of shell shock and (what we now know as) PTSD following World War I, which helped doctors better understand psychological trauma in general.

Although today we consider the concept of “mass hysteria” to be non gender-specific, and have since around 1839, that phrase was also once attributed exclusively to women—or collective nuttiness caused by women. One of the earliest documented cases of “hysteria” in a group of people occurred during the Middle Ages, when a convent of French nuns all began meowing like cats and would do so together for hours at a time, until soldiers from the surrounding town threatened to intervene if they did not stop. (Being nuns, they probably had too much venomous female semen stored up in their Wandering Wombs, eh?)

Also, as you probably know, in a more informal sense, the adjective “hysterical” can mean “extremely funny,” a sense that arose in 1939, appearing shortly thereafter in novels such as *The Walsh Girls* (1943) and a 1959 autobiography by Vincent Price. Does that mean uteri are especially funny? Aside from the Wandering Womb theory and the delightful fact that “uteri” is a grammatically correct pluralization of the word, probably not. (Uteruses is also correct, but that’s less fun.) Instead, it earned that sense because fits of uncontrollable laughter were among the extensive list of hysteria symptoms.

391,"I did initially report it, and went through the whole humiliating shebang of a rape-kit, a drug test, several interviews, a DNA-sample, and being asked several times to look at photos.

But then they revealed that the state's attorney didn't believe what happened to me constituted rape, because I initially consented. I could have pressed charges based on bodily harm, but it became very clear that the justice system was not on my side, and they hadn't caught the guy anyway. I didn't want to sit and wait for 5 years for the possibility of being called to witness my rapist get a slap on the wrist, so I withdrew the charges. I was just so done. 

The worst part? The laws regarding withdrawal of consent in my country got changed only a couple of weeks later. According to the police officer working on my case, it would have legally been rape under the new laws.

397,"I was a single dad for a while (my ex left me for someone else and spent very little time with our daughter (50/50 custody, but it was in reality 13 days with me, and an afternoon with her).

The way single dads get treated is poles apart from single mums. The single dad is a helpless/hapless hero for 'attempting' to parent their child. The single mum is considered a slut who can't keep her knees together (I find women can be equally judgmental in this respect too).

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I went out with my daughter, I would have women offering to take my daughter to the toilet for me. Female friends would drop off clothes, or food or offer to child mind for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the help when it was needed. I know my female friends didn't mean to look down on me as hapless dad (but it happened anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things that pissed me off the most was trying to take my daughter to learn to swim. The class was called mum &amp; baby. They were not happy about me joining (this was 20 years ago, and attitudes have changed somewhat) and I had to argue sexual discrimination for not letting me help my daughter to learn to swim. They gave in anyway, and I was the only dad in a mum and baby swimming group. It is great seeing parents (male of female) teaching kids to swim.

&amp;#x200B;

On the whole, the whole helpless dad in advertising seems to reinforce the stereotype that dads cannot parent."

410,"Well, it took longer than expected but a few months.  They hired me to do many things...set up art projects, fill and fire a kiln, throw birthday parties for children and demonstrate art related projects.  I did well at everything and always got excellent feedback.  I’m an artist, a professional in my community and well respected.  I just thought this job would be “fun”.  Maybe a little more exposure would be gained. 

When it came time to bag up the work of finished projects and call to let them know they’re ready to be picked up, I was literally screamed at for the way I so fluently spoke on the phone and for the way I closed a bag.  Mind you, for 10 years I was an “o” operator and even managed switchboards and a have been known to run an office or two or three, and have worked retail often in my day so the act of bagging and calling is a non issue.  But that manager micromanaged every single phone call and every single product I bagged.  There had to be 60 bags.  I was in my late 40’s and that manager had me in tears.  She was completely degrading and I could not help to think it was personal (looking back maybe jealousy). 

Also, we literally could not talk to the coworker standing next to us even if the place was empty. If I asked Sharon how her sick kid was, we would hear from across the room “No chit chat!”  If she heard a peep after that, she’d storm out of her office and say “Do I have to babysit you two?”
Took about a week to talk myself into not going back.

How anyone can be so condescending and still manage to have a roof over her head and a place in society is beyond me (she now works for a corrupt mayor back in my home town).

I'm not a feminist, I'm NOT some crazy feminist.. But it made me uncomfortable and feel bad... He's old enough to be my Dad... And I didn't think it was very nice... I feel bad about it... My boyfriend was there... But I'm NOT  a feminist I swear!"" and I was just like ""DUDE. A 40 YO man just grabbed you without permission, of course you're allowed to be upset!
