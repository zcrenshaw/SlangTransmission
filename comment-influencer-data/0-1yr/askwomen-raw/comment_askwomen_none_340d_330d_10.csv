1,"I've been asked if I live alone by the cable guy and furniture deliverer. Driving a few miles upstate to visit a friend, the gas station clerk asked if I was driving alone. 

Weirds me out. "
2,If all my kids are from the same husband. Wtf. A coworker in a professional industry asked me that. I do not think my kids dad has ever been asked anything even remotely similar. 
3,"Questions about having babies.

Anything about not wearing makeup. "
4,"Do men get asked why they put their career before babies? And then told they will regret it?


Because I‚Äôm real sick of that one "
5,"My first year teaching preschool was a whole fuckload of  failed Pinterest crafts. 

I slowly learned that *every* kids idea posted online was actually made by adults."
6,I had a female friend of my mothers ask if wearing tank tops is the reason I was raped. By my stepdad. Who raised me from 2-15. I am busty but wasn't at 15 when this happened. 
7,"It looks like you've lost the baby weight, right? When are you having another one??

1. No. 2. NO."
8,Usually anything decorated with burlap ends up being at least 30% less attractive than it looked on Pinterest.
9,"""You haven't been wearing makeup recently, are you depressed?"""
10,"Anytime I get even slightly irritated or show any sort of emotion that isn't pure goddamn joy I get hit with the ""are you on your period?"""
11,"When I was 16, I was at the beach with my extended family, and I was wearing a pretty simple, almost conservative (for a two-piece) bikini. A group of college kids did one of those cheesy ‚Äúdouble takes‚Äù as they walked past, then blatantly turned around 4-5 times to do it again. Finally, one of them yelled, ‚Äúhey babydoll, come over here so I can better look at you.‚Äù My uncle chased them 1/4 mile down the beach, then stormed back and snapped, ‚Äúdressing like that is just asking for it. You need to think about what you wear. What do you think is gonna happen when you walk around like that?‚Äù

But my grandfather, who is a crusty old conservative with no heart, snapped back, ‚Äú*she* can walk around naked if she wants. *She* is not the problem. Boys who treat women like that are the problem. You wanna yell at someone, go yell at the boys who just harassed your niece.‚Äù Then he started complaining about the postal service again so I left to get a snow cone. "
12,"Fuck I hear you on that one. The bingos I get when I say I'm not having children are insanity.

What does your husband think?? (He doesn't want kids either)

What if you regret it?? (I can always foster or adopt. I can't unbirth a baby)

Accidents happen! (I'm sterile. Unlikely. Also, abortion exists)

Who will take care of you when you're old?? (Beautiful young people I hire with my bags and bags of money I saved by not having children)

Don't you feel lonely?? (Nope)

How will you feel fulfilled?? (By having goals and desires unrelated to children)"
13,"I dated an ace woman for a couple of years. I loved her. I loved her a lot. But I‚Äôm not ace. I knew going into it that she was, and I‚Äôve never had a particularly high libido, so I figured, worth a shot. She was worth it.

It turns out that having a partner who‚Äôs physically completely uninterested in your body really, really sucks. I already had some issues around my own desirability. By the time we parted I could barely even stand to look in mirrors. If the woman I loved most didn‚Äôt want to see me naked, ever, there must be something wrong with me ... 

It sucked. Leaving sucked. I still miss her more than I miss anyone I‚Äôve dated before or after her. We avoided each other for a few weeks, were miserable, and then transitioned pretty comfortably to being close good friends. She‚Äôs with another ace woman now and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre happy, I really am; but I‚Äôll always be just a tiny bit sad that we couldn‚Äôt work together. 

But we couldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt regret the time I spent with her, but I‚Äôll never do that again. Sex, naked time and physical, bodily comfort with each other is way, way more important than I realised until i didn‚Äôt have it. "
14,"As soon as the words ""you're not allowed"" or ""I won't let you"" came out of their mouth I'd be out the damn door forever. "
15,"Not exactly the question, but I used to work at a pizza restaurant when I was 20 ish and we had some 50 year old creepy dishwasher that would ALWAYS touch me. He'd put his hand on my shoulder every time I walked by and things like that. I told him at least four time to stop touching me or else I'd get a manager. The next day he backed me into a corner and held me there by my shirt while he whispered something stupid in my ear (don't remember what). I immediately went to the manager and told him I would file for assault if that dude didn't stay the fuck away from me. 

The manager handled it well but was really kind of like, ok I guess I'll take care of this for you if it's really that big of a deal to you... Creepy guy stopped touching me but I became the new run of the rumor mill and butt of all these new ""don't touch khaki"" jokes (idgaf, for the record).

Then we got a new assistant manager a few months who was ten feet tall and gay and creepy af, the kind of guy who would grab a woman's chest and say it's ok because he was gay. He kept putting his hands on EVERYbody (except me, I told him off)- and the men started freaking out about how weird it was. To the point where everybody who worked in the store had to sign a contract saying they wouldn't touch anybody ever again. 

It's all a big joke when the creepy old guy is grabbing the college girl but God forbid when the creepy guy is making the men uncomfortable sound the alarms"
16,"If it's from a romantic partner, I'd probably prefer ""You look amazing in that outfit"". If it's from a friend, I'd probably prefer ""That outfit looks amazing on you"". "
17,"Two years ago my cousin was getting married and we went to her event venue a day or two before her event to drop some stuff off. The night before her wedding, there was another reception being held there. We walked around the tables and then realized that every table was movie themed, with probably the worst themes possible.  The head table was ""Trolls"" themed and the bouquets had ""troll hair"" in them, there was a poorly designed yellow brick road table made out of yellow felt and sharpie, the batman table had a bunch of those plastic rings they put on cupcakes... it was a disaster... The event venue was really, really classy and expensive so it was very jarring at how bad the decor was. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
18,"That's hideous, I'm so sorry that happened. I hope you're doing ok."
19,"Yeah, and the worst part is you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just cringey small talk, or something to actually be worried about."
20,"Cooking, because you probably won‚Äôt let a dish cooking half way and then leave it there sitting unattended "
21,What a dumb question. why would a cat wear makeup?
22,Why I don‚Äôt color my gray hair. My dumbass GI Dr said that my face looks too young for gray hair. Like wtf? I waited an hour and paid money to get lectured on my appearance - nope- I‚Äôm here because I have IBS &amp; GERD which is totally unrelated to my hair color. 
23,What terrible manners of those party guests
24,"I was trying to tell my dad about a recent sexual assault, and he was nodding along sympathetically until I mentioned that alcohol was involved, at which point he said, ""well I don't think it's really rape if the slut is lying there on the floor all drunk screaming 'fuck me!'"". He also called my brother a liar when my brother said that he would never pay for sex, saying, ""all men fuck prostitutes, and anyone who says he doesn't is a fucking liar."" Yikes. He also tried to ""compliment"" a waitress by saying, ""Ooh honey, do you know you got a big old thang followin' you around?"", at which point she smiled stiffly and wordlessly walked away. When I tried to tell him that it was fucked up to comment on a total stranger's ass, he said, ""Oh honey you don't understand, that's how you gotta talk to 'em, they like that kinda thing."" When I pressed him on what ""they"" meant (Women? Waitresses??), he said, ""You know, black bitches""...Jesus fucking Christ."
25,"I don't know if this entirely counts...a friend of mine got married at the end of June, had a beautiful wedding, she and her husband did so many personalized things from a flip flop ""dance shoes"" rack to him building a canopy for them to stand under while saying their vows.  

They had the ""Mr"" and ""Mrs"" signs hanging from the backs of their chairs at the table for the bridal party...and when they went to sit down to eat their dinner, other members of the party had taken their seats and said ""Well can't you just sit at a different part of the table?"""
26,Why don‚Äôt you wear makeup 
27,"Whenever I'm without my kids people are always asking if their dads ""babysitting""? What the fuck, no. He's just, you know, parenting. "
28,No 20 year old guy is best friends with a 15 year old girl for innocent reasons üòû
29,"i found one that actually worked pretty well for first graders for father‚Äôs day. basically, you take construction paper, and you add some masking tape to it to spell out a word (in this case: ‚ÄúDAD‚Äù) and then you hand them a paint brush and tell them to go buckwild all over the paper and the tape. after the paint dried they took the tape off so that ‚ÄúDAD‚Äù was written in the negative space. basically with little kids you can do anything that doesnt require too much precision - and even then you cant expect it to look like the examples on pinterest. as long as they had fun with it and got to stretch their creativity, i never really cared what the results looked like. i actually often find its better to not show them an ‚Äúexample‚Äù that you made, because they‚Äôll be sad that theirs doesnt look the same(/as good)."
30,"I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. My ex ghosted me when I had surgery to remove the mass and my dog died a week after I got home from the hospital. I now have my health, amazing friends and family and a rescued dog who can always bring a smile to my face. "
31,I for one appreciate his dedication to not spreading his genetic material.
32,"It was before Pinterest, and it wasn‚Äôt really that bad, but I still giggle when I think about it.

One of my best friends had an afternoon tea, and she made white chocolate mini muffins with raspberries. She could only fit one raspberry in each one, so they looked like bright pink nipples. We kept giving her hell about her ‚Äúboob muffins‚Äù the entire time. Sometimes, we still do. It‚Äôs been almost 10 years."
33,"I was doing a group project at a coffee shop. After my group mates left, he came up to me and told me I should never play poker because every annoyance was obvious and that he could hear my eyes roll. We ended up talking for hours and kissed in the parking lot. We‚Äôve been together 12 years, married for 9"
34,Clit stimulation
35,"My mom has five kids, and gets that question all the time.

She's started answering that she's not sure. "
36,"I married my high school sweet heart. After we had been married 6 years together for 8 she left me for someone else. We ended up working through it and got back together for 2 more years. We had been going to counseling. Things seemed to be improving and our relationship seemed stronger than ever. I came home from work the day before what was supposed to be our last counseling appointment. She was gone. No letter. No call no text. After I called her multiple times all I got was a text. ""I'm not coming home. I dont love you. I'm going back to him"" not that exactly but the was the point of the text. I destroyed a door. Just punched and kicked it until it was just splinters. My arms where scratched up my knuckles bloody. And I just collapsed. At some point I called my friend. Him and his wife came to get me. He just laid in the floor next to me as I couldnt stop sobbing. He is a firefighter and an emt. He bandaged me up helped me pack and they moved me Into there spare bedroom. I kept going to counseling. Still am. Still working on getting over it. On getting better. Every day seems a little brighter. Still have dark days. The last few weeks have been hard. No reason really. I question everything. I question every connection I have with the people in my life. I doubt myself. But I'm getting better. I moved. Have a new job. I'm losing weight and eating better. Life is hard but I know it can only get better if I let it.  I'll never forget the way I felt that day. And the kindness 2 people showed me. And I'll never stop trying. Sorry if this written poorly. Just kinda poured out of me after I started typing. 

Edit: am man. Didnt realize this was askwomen not askreddit."
37,"I constantly get questioned when I say I don‚Äôt want kids. My bf was never doubted in the slightest about that.

But surely I‚Äôll change my mind, won‚Äôt be a real woman and other kinds of bullshit"
38,"This probably isn‚Äôt an every-woman question but I‚Äôve seriously been asked, ‚ÄúDo you really need those glasses?‚Äù with a follow-up, ‚ÄúYou would look so much prettier without them. Have you thought about contacts?‚Äù

Um, have you thought about not being rude?"
39,"That you are happier in a clean room/house. 

That doesn't mean I enjoy cleaning or need my room to be spotless, but generally having everything up off the floors, clothes put away, dishes not in the sink, and my bed made does improve my mental health in a small but important way. I wish I had spent more time when I was younger learning good cleaning habits from her rather than rebelling by keeping my room so messy you couldn't see the floor. "
40,"My (now ex) husband left me for my (now ex) best friend. We had been together for 12 years, married for 9. He didn‚Äôt serially cheat; his honesty and integrity were things I deeply loved about him. It devastated me. I felt like my entire world changed overnight as well as my ability to trust myself to judge people.

I got through it with the help of friends (five ladies in particular), an excellent therapist, and my mother. I am a very resilient person, which helped a lot as well. There were a couple of books in particular that I found very useful, despite my anger each time I picked them up (‚ÄúWhy do I have to do all this work?! He/she‚Äôs the asshole!!‚Äù) Namely: The Journey from Abandonment to Healing (Susan Anderson) and How Can I Forgive? (Janis Spring).

Talking with trusted people, journaling, being as open as I could be with others and allowing people to support me. Through that, I learned that while I often saw myself as ‚ÄúJoe Smith‚Äôs wife‚Äù, the opposite seemed to be true. So many people told me they liked my ex-husband well enough, but I was the reason they wanted to spend time with us. It really shifted my self-perception in a positive way. 

Through the whole process, I realized the value of trying to be a good person and trying to be the best version of myself at any given time. When all I had to fall back on was my character and how well I had developed and maintained my relationships, I had so much support and strength to get through the most traumatic experiences of my life.

Edit: thank you for the gold!"
41,"As a woman in her 40s...

Why haven‚Äôt you gotten married? Or, the more hurtful version...  why didn‚Äôt anyone want to marry you?

Why are you single? You know, you‚Äôre at an age where it‚Äôs harder for you to meet a man. You should just find someone and settle down. 

Why didn‚Äôt you have kids? Didn‚Äôt you want kids? You‚Äôll regret not having kids. Who is going to take care of you when you‚Äôre older?

When are you going to settle down?

Sorry folks, I‚Äôm not really sure I ever want to get married, I won‚Äôt have kids for the sole reason of having someone take care of me, and wtf is settling down?  Why do you care if I meet expectations for what you think is normal? Ugh. 



"
42,Because I‚Äôm cheap and itchy.  
43,"Did you ask your husband?

He‚Äôs my husband, not my father. I don‚Äôt ask permission."
44,Why don't I smile more?
45,"Sounds like the beginning of an abusive relationship. First he takes away your right to hang out with your friends and controls how you spend your free time, next thing you know you're living 700 miles away from all your friends and family, watching every word out of your mouth because you're afraid of sparking a fight, and wondering if you're losing your mind because he keeps gaslighting you."
46,"And also: ""Why do you wear makeup? You would be so pretty without it."" "
47,"My sister threw a 'winter w-ONE-derland' party for my nephews first birthday. She tried to make chocolate dipped bananas that should have looked like penguins... Instead they ended up looking like little Poopy dicks. It was THE BEST THING EVER!

Edit: Wow, this blew up! My sister is asleep at the moment, but I'll ask for pics tomorrow morning! :D

Edit #2: My sister is slightly horrified 1.1k people upvoted this comment and are currently waiting to see her infamous 'Poopy dick' fail... She's scrambling to find the first original batch... But to tide you over, here is her not-much-better second attempt... and yes, these were actually served to the kids, for some reason...(once the original Poopy dick pics are found, I will update the link)! Enjoy this for now! https://imgur.com/a/nyoovil "
48, My best friend tried to make [this](https://i.imgur.com/SX0xQHu.jpg) but she only use sticks that she found outside on the ground and tried to cut them herself. She also didn‚Äôt decorate it properly and it honestly ended up looking like she flung some sticks and mud on to her wall
49,"They are not the perfect partner for me, but an amazing friend."
50,"My best friend of 4 years ghosted me. No reason given, I had gotten her a job at the bar I worked at  for 2 years(she already worked full time at the hospital, billing and such.) about 2 weeks after she started I woke up one day to find I was blocked on everything, a week later my boss came up to me and told me I was no longer working saturdays, I guess my former friend was refusing to work the same shifts as me and my boss liked her more. I couldn‚Äôt afford the financial hit so I was basically forced to resign. To this day I‚Äôm not sure why she did what she did. Our kids were best friends and couldn‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt see eachother anymore. Her family was apologetic, this wasn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs done this to someone. It all happened about 2.5 years ago and to this day it still hurts a bit to think about. Why wasn‚Äôt I good enough, what happened? Was I a bad friend? "
51,"The one I *really* love is ""why do you wear glasses, you look so pretty without them?"". 

Because I can't fucking see! I find contacts to be extremely uncomfortable to wear. Glasses are so much more practical and I don't have to haul solution and carrying cases and eye drops around with me when I take them off. I don't have to have clean hands to adjust them. And tbh I think my glasses are pretty damn cute. "
52,"&gt; Accidents happen! 

I absolutely fucking hate this.

Why do people think it's acceptable for them to say this to someone?

When people say it, it's like they're wishing it on the person. They aren't saying it out of concern, like ""better wrap it up!"" they're saying it in a sing-song giggly way, like they *want* your contraception to fail &amp; they want to force an unwanted child onto you."
53,Transition to friends.
54,"Yep. I mean, I'd try to talk about it and reassure him but if that didn't work, he's not the one for me.

Though if he brought it up initially as ""I will no longer let you do this"" then hell no. I'm outta there."
55,TIL that you're supposed to have your next kid once you lose the baby weight.
56,"Vibrator. Also, touching myself during sex and, if he's hitting the spot, telling him so he keeps doing it. 

Also my boyfriend is an asshole and teases me for at least 30-60 mins before sex so at that point crossing my legs in the right way would probably make me cum. "
57,"I went to a wedding where the bride tried to pull off like every Pinterest cliche wedding project. There were Hershey kisses each with a little sticker that said something about love, but the text was badly formatted and off center. There was a ‚Äúchoose a seat not a side‚Äù sign that looked terrible.  Favors were those key bottle openers that don‚Äôt work. 

The worst part was they clearly cheaped out in all guest related things and ran their bridal party ragged. Like instead of sticking stickers on a thousand kisses maybe you could have made it so your guests didn‚Äôt have to buy their own sodas?"
58,"I really and truly hate the burlap trend. I love barns as much as the next person, but burlap is used for sacks because it‚Äôs cheap and itchy. So why would you want to use it in your beautiful wedding?? "
59,"As a black woman who worked a service job before, I really fucking hate your dad. "
60,"Morning people who want to hit you up before you've even taken your coat off. The weirdos who don't wash their hands before leaving the bathroom. Gossips/busybodies (who don't even get the facts right). Loud talkers, especially those who don't bother closing their office door before taking a conference call. Meetings that should have been an email. 

Edit: Unless it's important or we're friends, leave me alone."
61,"""don't pluck your eyebrows that thin, you will regret it!"""
62,That's a really cute idea... for a kid's birthday party
63,"Same here. 

I‚Äôve heard along the lines of ‚Äúthis is a nice house, do you live alone?‚Äù 

I dunno if it‚Äôs a weird ‚Äòscoping out‚Äô thing, trying to see if I have a boyfriend or husband, or these guys can‚Äôt believe a woman can live alone, or are upset I can afford a house by myself or what. 

It‚Äôs really weird, and awkward. I had three big guys deliver a fridge to my house and they‚Äôre all in my kitchen and one looks me up and down and asks ‚Äúso, are you all alone here?‚Äù 

Wtf. So creepy. "
64,"This reminds me of when I was in middle school, and the boys had a game they called ‚Äúcancer‚Äù. The girls were just starting to develop breasts, and so the boys would run up to a girl and grab her boob and squeeze (the point was literally to hurt your boob, if the girls boob wasn‚Äôt big enough to grope, they‚Äôd punch it) and say ‚Äúyou have cancer now‚Äù. 

The girls complained to the teachers and they literally told us ‚Äúoh boys will be boys, don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù

The game was eventually banned when someone did it to my friend, who‚Äôs mum had just been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. 

But apparently boys running around and forcefully groping our boobs to the point it hurt wasn‚Äôt good enough. "
65,"That question instantly makes me suspicious and I get versions of it frequently. I pretty much always lie, especially if someone asks me if I live alone (like the pizza guy last night wtf dude)."
66,"Yeah, especially because one of the people was the bride's sister  =(  I met up with the bride the day after the wedding to help with clean-up and she was giving me all the scoop on how awful her bridesmaids were"
67,"I can see how that would cut deep, but please keep telling yourself that the person responsible is your step dad, not you in any way at all. And your mother's friend is a stupid cow, don't listen to anything she says. Take care of yourself x"
68,"I moved from Missouri to Arizona for my boyfriend. A day after moving there, he dumped me, saying I wasn't good enough for him. I was devastated... 4 years down the drain. I taught my students each day, then drove home and shut myself in. My friend at work convinced me to go out with her one Friday night. She picked the place. 

We went in, and sat at the bar. Ordered a drink. Then a gorgeous guy sat down next to me, checking his phone. He said hi. I said hi. We chatted. My girlfriend ""went to the bathroom."" I gave him my number. He was looking for the peace corps return volunteer happy hour group, but couldn't find them. 

We dated for 5 months. I moved home for grad school. We kept in touch. A year and a half later, my cousin died from cystic fibrosis at 24. That night, I asked myself if I died tomorrow, what I would want..and he was the answer. I texted him, told him my feelings, and shortly thereafter he came to visit. 

We have been married 7 years, and have an 18 month old. It's so crazy, how it all came down to a series of choices that led us to the same place on the same night. "
69,My best friend of 19 years dropped me without explanation. Her mom still talks to me sometimes through social media. But I haven't heard from her in almost 7 years. 
70,"Hey.... Sometimes it just happens with age. After 38 years of marriage, and a houseful of now grown children, we were happy to have an empty nest. But the interest just isn't there in sex and hasn't been for quite some time. And we're totally ok with that. We laugh about it. We love each other more than anything in this world, and wouldn't change a thing. We figure if we work our way back to it, great. If not, it's not a deal breaker.   We've created a beautiful life together. And in the big picture, sex is truly such an insignificant and unimportant part of your life. True, sex feels pretty damn significant and important when you're young. But as you age, when you get up there around my age, you begin to understand. There are just so many more important things to take its place. 
So me and my lover husband? We'll be just fine. "
71,"Thanks :/ I'm trying to be okay, but she said this just a few months ago and I think about it everytime I have to go home. It really made me question myself. But also I didn't wear tank tops back then. I was depressed and a little goth. I wore baggy black sweatshirts everyday. "
72,"Lmao, I got that this summer when I stopped wearing makeup for a few weeks because I was worried about my lacrimosal stone coming back, so I stopped putting shit on my face that might possibly encourage another infection.

'I'm not depressed; I'm trying to avoid surgery I don't want'"
73,"Tbh that's pretty ugly even as the ""professional"" version"
74,"I haven‚Äôt gotten this, but my kids have been asked if one of them is adopted. Our eldest has my husband‚Äôs Hispanic coloring. If she‚Äôs anywhere near sunshine her skin soaks it up, even though I slather both kids in sunscreen. Our son inherited my Swedish background. He‚Äôs the spitting image of me when I was a kid. Goth white skin, red hair &amp; freckles. The only thing our son inherited from my husband was his ridiculously long eyelashes. We all have dark brown eyes. 

One of my husband‚Äôs cousins died in her 30s from cancer. Her two boys had different fathers. They get questioned about it a lot. And it pisses me off. Why the fuck does it matter if they don‚Äôt have the same dad? They had a mother who loved them with all her heart and grandparents who love them and raised them as their own. Not to mentions aunts, uncles, cousins, and cousins-in-law, like me. How in the hell does the fact that these two young gentlemen have different fathers affect your life in ANY way?? 

/rant"
75,I‚Äôve been asked by real people in real life some pretty intrusive questions about why type and colour of underwear I‚Äôm wearing/if I wear a bra and why!
76,Asexual. 
77,"Being asked about my grooming habits, such as why I don‚Äôt straighten my hair or why I don‚Äôt wear it down. I suspect it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm black and work in a sea of white men and women who think letting my hair down is as simple as 1,2,3. And then the women with ‚Äúcurly‚Äù hair begin to tell me their routines.

Afro textured hair=/= curly hair. Don‚Äôt talk to me about your routine, Susan. Idgaf.

"
78,"clean and or pickup everyday.
But most important is: get rid of clutter.
Throw it out, donate it, just get rid of it.
If it doesn‚Äôt bring you joy and you don‚Äôt use it, get rid if it."
79,"Man, I really wanna punch your dad in the face."
80,"In my thirties, I reconnected with my high-school sweetheart. We were in a wonderful relationship. One day, I decide to buy him a motorcycle. A week later he was killed on that motorcycle. I will never forgive myself for buying that damn thing. He was his mother's only child, and my decision to buy the motorcycle took him away from her and I lost a true love. "
81,"Whenever I was pregnant I was asked ‚Äúwas it planned??‚Äù Sorry random male coworker I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs your business. 

My husband was never asked if our kids were planned. "
82,"I don't think it would bother me. I know that it's a dealbreaker for some people but to me sex isn't the be all and end all of intimacy - some people need it, others don't, neither are wrong."
83,Oh man my friend‚Äôs boyfriend rubbed his hand across my back the other day and I was like can I help you? He goes ‚Äúoh I wasn‚Äôt sure if you were wearing a bra‚Äù first of all why does it matter and second fuck offÔøº
84,"Hard choice, I like to just go with ""I love your outfit"" I've gotten into the habit of only complimenting people on what they can control. 

So instead of you look great with red lipstick, it's I love that lipstick colour etc "
85,My son just turned 7 months and I've already had people ask when I'm having #2. I bluntly tell them that the first pregnancy gave me severe ppd that's turned full blown depression and I have no interest in seeing how much worse my mental state can get. Blunt honesty is my favorite way of dealing with intrusive questions. 
86,The worse is the illusion that DIY Pinterest-inspired decor projects will save money than to just buy the already made items outright. What you're saving in direct cost you are paying in work hours (even if it's via friends helping for free..) 
87,"A friend of mine was getting married and doing all sorts of pinteresty things, so I offered to help out. They had spray painted mason jars but had done it poorly, the paint was all uneven and drippy. So rather than spending the $12 to buy more mason jars to try again, 3 of us spent almost 2 hours using paint thinner to scrub the paint off... my hands were raw and sore after that, and my lungs didn't feel good from the fumes. I even offered to pay for new ones because of how absurd it felt. The second coat went on better, and it ended up looking alright, but I will never get those 2 hours of my life back. "

""But who is taking care of your kids?""

My husband. Which always lead to, ""But wouldn't be be happier as the breadwinner?""

Stfo, ain't your life.

I will finish this of my saying the kids are now old enough that both of us work, I make more per hour still, but he brings home more pay because I'm waiting for back surgery so I can get back to working full time. The current questions are more about him whether or not he's unhappy knowing his wife has a higher pay rate than him, why sometime so young is having to use a cane to walk, and comments about how if I just lost some weight I wouldn't need that awful cane.

I'm glad I'm a WAHM, I don't have to put up with work collegues questioning my every little decision either. It's bad enough when I'm okay-ish to go outside."
89,"I take 5-10 minutes a day to wipe surfaces and tidy up. I wipe down counters, sinks, whatever needs it, organize, and put stuff away.

98,"When I had to move to Dallas from California for work and my 10-year old son decided to stay with his dad because he didn‚Äôt want to leave his best friend whom he‚Äôs known since he was three.  And I knew that was what was best for him so I didn‚Äôt fight for him to come with me.

The heartache rears it‚Äôs head every month when I put him on the plane back to California and every time I get ‚Äúthe look‚Äù when someone finds out I‚Äôm a non-custodial parent.  "

100,"So annoying. 9/10 times, I'm not on my period when they ask, but they NEVER believe me"

(I had no idea when I initially applied, the ad didn't mention it, but I figured what the hell, could be fun, lol) He was the first person I met, we dated long distance for 3 years then went our separate ways because it was just too hard to maintain the relationship in college. 10 years later we reconnected, got married last year, and are expecting our first child in December."

Locking my door and putting on headphones if I‚Äôm watching porn also helps block out the world so I‚Äôm more focused on my own pleasure.

I also tend to have certain spank bank memories or fantasies that help tip me over the edge when I‚Äôm close. Those help on days when my orgasm seems impossible to achieve. "

110,"She told me I'd regret quitting my dance classes. ""Yeah right, mom. They're grueling, boring, and I could spend the time I'm in them watching cartoons instead. What could there be to regret?""

She turned out to be correct, though. I do wish I had stuck with it while my muscles were still malleable enough for it. I think dancing is so lovely and it's something I wish I could do, now."

120,"Cupcakes instead of wedding cake at a wedding. It's a cute idea but the visual just wasn't quite right. Not cringey really - but definitely a ""didn't quite pull it off"" moment. Edit to add: uh, I'm getting downvoted so I guess I wasn't super clear about what happened. I'm not saying cupcakes suck instead of wedding cake. I'm saying the way it was done at this particular wedding was really odd. They way they were stacked and decorated - on top of pallet boards - seemed like someone was trying way too hard to get a signature Pinterest look. There weren't enough cupcakes for the number of guests to top it all off. "
121,"Recently I've been thinking a lot about gray hair. I realized that I was pretty old before it dawned on me that most women dye their hair and it's not really normal to be in your late 40's without a single gray hair in sight. It's fucked up that it went from a personal choice to basically a societal expectation. 

I decided I want to age gracefully, I don't want to hide the completely natural aging process, I don't want to be desperately chasing youth like most of my family has. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Aging shouldn't be taboo and fuck society for devaluing people the older they get. "
122,"Avoiding dating the 3 B‚Äôs: bartenders, bouncers, &amp; band members "
123,"He was dating a good friend in high school. We were out in front of his house. She went to go get him. He came out to meet us. He was so much older,3 years,‚Äô. He barely talked to any of us. Apparently I got blind drunk and talked to him and cried on his shoulder. We ended up together three years later.  She set us up when they broke up. We are married 30 years now. "
124,"To me, what makes all those Pinterest ideas so cringey is how wasteful they are. No one wants your garbage key-shaped bottle openers and they end up going in the trash anyway. People will be fine if you don‚Äôt have a basket full of made in China flip flops for them to dance in, which also ultimately get thrown out because wtf are you going to do with 80 pair of bedazzled flip flops. [Tables overloaded with flowers](https://goo.gl/images/a4ZJdX) create an illusion of socioeconomic status and wealth, but the total disregard for resource consumption and wastage is what makes it so cringey to me.

Rude. Intrusive. "
127,"I never understood this. If I tell someone I have a pain in my stomach unrelated to my period, everyone's full of sympathy.

132,"A lot of things .... but Aldi is pretty great. I‚Äôd complain as a child and want the name brand fruit roll ups and snack cakes.  It‚Äôs so cheap. Sure some of the stuff is awful (store brand Triscuits....)  But most is fine or even good. And cheap.

Also she told me not to fry things naked. I assume that‚Äôs good advice and didn‚Äôt ask for details."

138,"Honestly, most ""rustic"" stuff I see on pinterest looks ugly to me even when done to perfection. I don't want to fault others' preferences--they don't need to cater to my specific tastes.

*EDIT because I forgot to delete a word."
139,"I've known this girl for a few years but I was friends with her husband more than her.  She was an acquaintance for a few years and whenever I saw her at a party we'd spend about two hours straight talking and I'd think ""I want to be friends with her but she's so cool, why would she want to be friends with me?""

Back in February she invited me to a girls' night at her house, and then in March my SO came to town and we got together with her and her husband for drinks.  I started hanging out with her a lot more after that and it turns out that she'd felt the same way about me - wanted to be my friend but thought I was too cool!  Turns out we're just both total nerds.

We have one other friend who was in a similar situation - really nice, get along well, never really became more than acquaintances - and she became close with us as well.  She and I helped out with a lot of different prep stuff in the week before the wedding and now the three of us have a card club together and a group chat where we message each other about random shit every day.  If only we'd become close a year earlier!"
140,"I met him here on Reddit! We were both in an /r/AskReddit thread, and clashed on a topic. Three weeks later, we were still talking anonymously, and when I asked to learn more about him, I learned he lived 20 minutes away from me! We met up, kept seeing one another, and our two month wedding anniversary is today. :)
He is currently snoring while flopped over on my side of the bed and I am in the kitchen having a 3AM snack to be away from it for a second.

EDIT; People are asking what we were arguing about. We were arguing about whether or not sex is implied in a sugar-daddy/baby relationship. We both had some interesting sexual encounters and relationships, and it got pretty heated. We did the civil thing and took it to PMs, then realized our opinions weren‚Äôt as different as we thought. Then we just started talking! "

Like, I got in at 7 this morning, I just want to finish up what I'm doing and go home, I don't have time to *start* figuring out how to fix your problem right at the end of the day, poor planning on your end does not constitute an emergency on mine!  

Extra annoying because I'm salaried, so I don't get paid anything extra if I have to stay late to fix some stupid infinite loop some dumbass thought it was a great idea to kick off right when everyone starts leaving for the day.  *Hrrrgh.*"
143,"Start some seeds or buy already grown houseplants. They're a relatively easy hobby and will add a little life and coziness to your home. Make sure you do proper research into them, though. You want to choose houseplants that require a level of maintenance you're willing and able to sustain. Also, make sure to research all the proper supplies you'll need. Some plants need lots of drainage in their pots, some need sandy soil, some need to be misted by use of a spray bottle, etc. Once you get them started, they're not much daily work and you'll probably feel a little sense of pride when you see them start to grow and flourish."
144,"I did a 'negative space' art project like that when I was in grade 2. It was a very similar craft with a Christmas theme, but we chose and drew the silhouettes ourselves. Many people chose trees, stars or snowflakes. I had just seen the Mickey Mouse christmas carol, so I thought I was being super-creative by drawing a candle and candlestick. I thought I must have done an AMAZING job, because my parents saved it for ever and ever. It was so good that it became a permanent addition to our box of Christmas decorations!

Fast forward to my early 20s, when I find it in the box of Christmas decorations and suddenly realize that the silhouette of a candle (as drawn by a 7 year old) looks like a giant holiday dildo. My parents were laughing their asses off every year for decades. "
145,"I fell in love with a then-undiagnosed guy with borderline personality disorder and lots of addictions. He could literally make me feel like the most amazing person in the world, and completely tear me down a few hours later. He drove me crazy and every time I successfully distanced myself from him, he managed to pull me back in. He still drops into my life (well, my messages) every six months or so. I only managed to cut him loose because I met my boyfriend and he's just amazing. I've been with him for three years now, but my ex is still making sure I think of him. To be fair, even if he didn't reach out to me I would never be able to forget him. Not because I still love him, but I'm still resentful. "

There may also be a boner on your buns. But all of this is nice :)"
148,We had some epic fights over the length of my shorts and other clothing choices during my teen years. I sent her a picture the other day of the high necked long sleeved work dress I‚Äôd just purchased and she just laughed and laughed. She also taught me that being exceedingly polite but refusing to back down can often get you what you want. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times that advice has come in handy. 
149,"If I have a boyfriend, and strangely how old is he? "

151,Does DIY ombr√© hair count? 
152,"DIY hair mask. 
In hindsight... I knew better. But I did it because Pinterest told me to. 
The mask consisted of olive oil, coconut oil, and honey. Maybe a few other kitchen staples. Left in on for an hour. I went to wash it out, and realized how soft and luxurious my hair was. 
It was only soft because it was still SO greasy. I smelled like a deep fat fryer for a week. It took several diligent washings and a long time to get my hair back right. It was disgusting."
153,"What does (boyfriend) think of that?

This has ranged from me getting a new job, new hobby, going to a friend's party, new game,  to seeing a movie, buying clothes, haircut, and what I ate for dinner last night. 

I don't know and I don't care.  If he does, that's on him to deal with not me. "
154,If im pregnant yet. I get asked this question by men and women equally. Mostly by people that aren't even close to me but customers or suppliers at work. My husband and I got married in may and we've been trying to conceive since last February. No-one ever asked my husband so far.
155,"You're fine! Your story is important, too. And also, your friend is a real one. Not many people have friends like that. I think that on some level probably speaks to your character as well.

It gets better every day. Good luck, and do your best."
156,well first you stick the masking tape onto the back of your hand to remove a bit of the stickiness. left that part out for sake of brevity. Even the kids who forgot that step managed to get the tape off with minimal tearing of the paper though!
157,"I have one baby and 0 plans to have more, and I STILL get asked when I‚Äôm having more babies. I tell them I don‚Äôt want more babies, I want to finish my bachelors and work towards a doctorate.

Whenever you have an important project due, pause for a minute and contemplate the state of your baseboards. Is it really appropriate to work on such an important project - that costs money and has people depending on you - when your baseboards are dirty?


Also, before you leave the house for something that you really need to be on time for, ask yourself, ""Is my freezer really as clean as it could be?"" What if there's an emergency inspection in your building while you're at the [funeral/job interview/court appearance], and your filthy freezer is exposed? You should probably clean the oven too.



Say you spontaneously agree to host dinner, and company will arrive within hours. Understand how disrespectful it is to your guests if the drawers of your desk are not meticulously organized. So get that out of the way before dealing with the stack of dishes or the pile of laundry on the couch. This is also the best time to create a cataloging system for your books. 



That's my system. Many people reject it because it is pathologically stupid, but it does guarantee that every book and cranny regularly gets cleaned.

161,"When my ex husband punched me in the face a few times, then swung me by my hair into a door frame, my dad asked what I did to provoke it. He also said if I act ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù enough, I should expect these things.

167,"So I was the one that tried this, didn‚Äôt actually do it because it didn‚Äôt work.

So I was having my college graduation party at my moms house and I saw this cute balloon thing on Pinterest, it was cute, seemed cheap and easy so I tried it! So it was colored tulle wrapped around a balloon. Bought the tulle, a helium tank, and balloons..... day of the party, I‚Äôm putting it together and realize that the tulle is making the balloon too heavy to float. I tried everything I could because it would‚Äôve been super cute! Nope. Wouldn‚Äôt float. Gave up on the tulle and just had to use the plain balloons.

171,"I make and deliver wedding cakes so I see a lot of cliches, which is fine I guess if they‚Äôre done well. I don‚Äôt see it so much any more but a few years ago about 80% of the weddings I did had that sign ‚Äúchoose a seat not a side, we‚Äôre all family when the knot is tied‚Äù and honestly I saw it so much it drove me mad. 

The main problem with Pinterest though is that a lot of the photos on there are shopped, so I get loads of people asking me for a cake that‚Äôs so gold and sparkly because it is digitally edited, so I can‚Äôt achieve that and make it edible! Or they want burlap ribbon, do you know how much that shit moults???"
172,"I'm generally a very smiley person so I don't often get this, but when I do, it's usually especially annoying and hurtful. The last instance really sticks out in my mind, because I had just lost a patient but needed to complete his chart. I have no idea what my face looked like, but an EMT was walking by when he crouched down into my face and said, ""Girl, you need to smile! You're too pretty to frown all the time!"" To this day, I wish I'd done something other than laugh awkwardly and say thank you. "
173,"She started pulling away when I started trying to have kids. 
My oldest was born 14 weeks early and in the hospital a long time. She never visited once even though she literally works IN THE SAME HOSPITAL. 

After he came home, I still arranged times for us to go out together alone and was cognizant of not talking about baby stuff constantly but maybe I still did too much. I don't know. She never told me. 

Eventually it just became obvious that I was the only person trying to maintain this friendship and I stopped. 

But I honestly had dreams about her for years afterward. 


Edit: because it's being (fairly) brought up a lot. She was single and child-free by choice. Never wanted children at all. 
I had gone through 2 years of infertility and 2 miscarriages before my son was born at 26 wks. 

If the ghosting was related to the kids (which I have to believe) it was an aversion to children, not an envy situation.

I don‚Äôt have a huge appetite during the day and I prefer small portions (huge fan of tapas). I usually have a smaller portion of whatever I had for tea the night before at work.

To get through it, you just gotta' brace up for the waves of pain and know that the show will go on. You will find new relationships, explore new places, make new friends, and love new people and animals. No person or animal is a good replacement for losing someone you love, but you'll find that your heart is big enough to love many news things, too. :)"
182,"You know what is bizarre?  I never had a single person ask me this in my life,  EVER. Not in my 20s, not in my 30s, no in my 40s. The only thing I can imagine is that I'm so homely that everyone assumed there was no point in even inquiring."
183,"At a wedding I went to, when they sent out invitations, they included a small card and asked invitees to write out their favourite family recipe (along with some joke about the couple finally learning how to cook).  
  
At the wedding, they had gorgeous little specialty recipes books printed with all of their family and friends‚Äô recipes in it, with a little dedication thanking everyone for their contribution towards helping them start their *new* family. I unfortunately can‚Äôt remember exactly what the dedication said because I lost the book in a move, but it was something along the lines of thanking the people who had been *their* foundation in life helping them lay a new foundation together :)    
  
You better believe the extended family was over the *moon* with how special it made them feel."
184,My now ex boyfriend broke up with me because he has been struggling a lot with depression and he thought he couldn‚Äôt make me happy or he could be happy... we were together for 2 years and on a long distance. I still make sure everyday that I am here if he needs help. I really miss him.

190,"How old I am. I‚Äôm a nurse and am turning 30 right around the corner. Been doing this for over 7 years. I get asked if I‚Äôm ‚Äúold enough‚Äù all the time because my mother blessed me with a baby face. A lot of people tell me to enjoy it, but it‚Äôs messed up that my skills get questioned because of age. I find that when I‚Äôm starting some place new (we have moved quite a bit for my husband‚Äôs job) , I have to work twice as hard to prove that I know what I‚Äôm doing. 

And here‚Äôs a great one for you. When I was a nurse of about 2 years, I was precepting a brand new nurse who was 44 yo. We had a patient that refused to let me put in the IV because I was ‚Äúobviously new based on my age‚Äù. So I had my brand new, never put an IV in before 44yo baby nurse do it. I literally instructed her as she did it and the patient had no issues with that. Even talked to her about how she‚Äôs probably done this soooo much before. So dumb. "

Only then did I begin to process the damage that had been done by my ex. Now that I look back the signs were all there that I was hurting, but for 2 years I ignored it all and lied to myself.

&gt;choose a seat not a side, we‚Äôre all family when the knot is tied

I see these signs on bridal FB groups (being sold) a lot and it DRIVES ME MAD. It sounds kinda of demeaning tbh, like the sign writer thinks of themselves so highly that they're above petty sides and their guests need to be told otherwise. Like maybe that's an overreaction, but it doesn't occur to me to choose a side anyway. Same with the ""turn of your phones and be present"" signs. JUST SAY YOU'D RATHER NO PHOTOS, this whole ""be fully present"" crap sounds like you're telling a kid to stop getting distracted.

I think there's just too many damn signs in the current Pinterest weddings, and they're all either worded like treating guests as children or kinda gross and sexist. Does your ring bearer really need a freakin sign hanging off their neck telling the groom it's too late to run? y u c k"

Wedding day arrives. She is about to walk down the aisle: alone. Instead of the wedding march a video is projected on the front wall of the church of her dad on his sick bed telling her how beautiful she is and how proud he is of her and how he knows this marriage is forever and he's so sorry he had to miss the wedding and that he loves her. 

Video is paused to allow her to gather herself, wedding march is played. She makes it to the front, priest asks who gives her away, video unpauses and finishes with dad giving her away and blowing a kiss."

241,"I was at a wedding with a cupcake table once. 

The wedding party took over an hour to get from the ceremony to the reception venue because they were taking photos, but there wasn't really any food being passed around for the 100 or so guests waiting around. So people started helping themselves to the cupcakes.

Nobody realized they were supposed to be the wedding cake until the bride finally showed up. She didn't throw a fit or anything, but word spread among the guests pretty quickly that she was upset. I don't think the staff even realized, because they didn't discourage anyone. 

The bride and groom ended up doing the ""cake cutting"" after dinner (feeding each other a cupcake for photos) and just let the guests help themselves to whatever was leftover, but I think everyone felt bad because they didn't take many cupcakes the second round. I don't think they got a photo of the full spread, not that it was arranged in any particular way that I recall."

244,"Totally agree! The first is a compliment that includes a little judgment on how you normally look everyday. Both are flattering things to say, but the first implies the viewer is analyzing and judging your body in some way.  The second puts the emphasis on your stylistic choices. It implies that you have great taste and not just you happen to find something that shows off your body well.  

That said, if anyone said either sentence to me, I‚Äôd take it as a great compliment and thank them."

Was horrible, cried for a week and just stayed at a friends house to well, really just cry and hope every day it would feel better. Listened to audiobooks during that time to keep sane. Then when it got slightly bearable I signed up for a lot of things I really wanted to do but never had found the energy to do or the time. So basically applied for my dream job (surprisingly got it) while still studying, doing more classes than average (actually just finished with the average but tried for a long time and kept me super busy) and signing up for a marathon. Although an injury in the end also made me not able to run that, I got to a super high mileage and more importantly, got through the winter without becoming depressed. Next to that, I was honest with all my friends about how much I was hurting and that I really needed them although I could give little back in return during that time. I think that made it a lot easier for them because they knew what to expect and that I wasn‚Äôt turning selfish, but simply needed them during that time. I also visited all of my friends and cousins who lived somewhere else and stayed with my auntie for a while who has a lot of pets (dogs and cats) to just cuddle with them all day.  All of these things kept me functioning until months later it started to hurt less and less. We had fought a lot about my dream to learn Spanish in a Latin American country and so one year after we broke up I actually did that.

* EDIT since this just happened as we speak: people who reply all instead of just to the targeted person. Every new hire, every promotion, every major accomplishment gets a day full of BS. I've put some filters in for subjects containing words like ""congratulations"" but stuff still gets through. We're a very touchy feely company so it's at least once a week."

301,"You just described my last relationship. Went into it knowing she was asexual and had a lot of the same feelings you listed. It sucked. I loved her so much, but I realize now after we've separated that it wouldn't have worked out because we're simply incompatible in that regard. I need some kind of physical affection in my relationship to feel like it's working.

I still miss her a lot. We don't talk anymore, but I'm hoping with more time we can transition back to being friends again. She was one of the best friends I've ever had. We were so compatible on a personal level and I hate knowing how good of friends we can be, but it not being the current reality of the situation."

I'll keep pushing back, but it's deeply ingrained and I have no delusions that he'll ever change. "
313,"I worry about this being the general view of men, and that they hide it to be able to have a partner. Maybe that's because I've just come out of a relationship with someone who told me guys only want to fuck though? Hopefully."

315,"Ooh, great discussion topic. I have one: in college, I told my dad about how my good friend was stalked and raped, something troubling me a lot at the time. He responded by expressing surprise that it was still considered rape if the woman said yes to sex before starting to say no, and then said ""as a man it can be hard to stop once you've started.""

Also, this is a guy who was himself once molested when he was little, and totally considers that a horrible thing that has impacted him. "
316,"I also grew up on a farm. ‚ÄúRustic‚Äù furniture makes me cringe. It‚Äôs always so splintery and awful to touch.

327,"My roommate wanted to go swing dancing and was trying to convince me to go with her.

Just as bad were all the dudes siding with him and no one saying he did anything wrong. She had it coming for cheating. 


Super disgusting.

Well we got a smoke bomb where I got my gender scan at, we were super excited. We cut the back of a pumpkin to place it in and then set it off behind us. That's how it WAS supposed to go, but it didn't. What actually happened was it literally blew up in my husband's face, half his face was covered in pink, his ears were ringing, and he was pissed! This all was supposed to be live on Facebook, luckily/unfortunately my bff wasn't able to and just took paprazzi style pics. He passed her knowing she was doing pictures/video in a rage he told her to delete everything. (She didn't) I helped him clean up and then he was not so grumpy, now was kinda laugh at the picture.

337,"Seconding the therapy suggestion- even if your first attempt didn't work, finding the right therapist will make a world of difference. I had sex again after about six months, but I was already sexually active before the assault, so your experience will likely be different."

341,"I have a similar story, my first job at 16 was at a restaurant, as a host.

I had two instances.
One was a 50+ year old man who wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone, would call the restaurants on his days off and ask for me and would say things like ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you come over? I could‚Äôve rubbed your back, and I‚Äôd let you drink whatever you want‚Äù, would follow me to my car and try to kiss me, etc.

Another one was another host (I went to school with him, actually) would send me videos of him jacking off and shit. At work he would push me into the ‚Äúhost closet‚Äù and try taking my shirt off.

When I went to management about these two, I was told ‚Äúwell, what do you expect? You work in a restaurant‚Äù

I eventually ended up quitting over it, and was ‚Äúblack listed‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt except my notice. "
342,Stand close or hover over my shoulder. None of them mean anything at all by it; it‚Äôs just a personal bubble space thing.

343,"I studied computer science in university and I graduated with a really high GPA. I‚Äôm doing a Master‚Äôs in the same field now. I know I‚Äôm good at this. But in my undergrad there was one course in particular that I was struggling with a bit, and I mentioned it to my grandfather who is highly educated, has a PhD in geophysics or something but also studied some computer science during his undergrad. His response: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still studying computer science? Well you know, women aren‚Äôt good at that kind of thing. They‚Äôre better at art and writing.‚Äù"

348," I'm a guy, but based on my experience I think genetics plays a lot into it. I had one GF who could literally lay still, close her eyes, and think herself to orgasm. Had another who could only orgasm through anal. Everyone is different.

Open and honest communication helps. Slow down, move a little this way, slower, etc can go a long way. If you fake enjoyment in a sub-par position, don't be made if he keeps doing it. Tell him what you need/ want, if he cares he will listen. 

And guys, listen. Actually listen. And you can always ask. Does they actually feel good, can I do something different/better? Also, if she says ""right there don't stop"" that doesn't mean start jackhammering really hard and fast. It means keep doing EXACTLY what you are doing at EXACTLY the same speed, and don't stop. "

350,"I always thought men would want the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù girl. I would see these beautiful girls with perfect figures and gorgeous hair and flawless skin, and I would think ‚Äúwhy would anyone love me when there are girls like THAT out there?‚Äù

But men are drawn to personality, not just looks. And that seems obvious but when you‚Äôre insecure, you kind of feel like everything is against you. I thought I would never find a man because I wasn‚Äôt the prettiest girl in the room, and I thought I‚Äôd have to get used to being alone forever. 

But my boyfriend loves me even though there are prettier girls walking by us on the street. His friends love their girlfriends even though there are drop dead gorgeous models that exist out there. 

One of his friends whose particularly charming and funny and kind fell in love with a woman 25 years older than him. And she‚Äôs not a model, she‚Äôs not your stereotypical sexy mom you‚Äôd like to bang. She‚Äôs just a mom. And he could date models and young beautiful women, but he fell for her. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just ranting about my projected insecurities. But basically...men aren‚Äôt dogs. They won‚Äôt drop everything for a hot blonde model. They like funny women and they like smart women and they like women they can talk with. Maybe for some looks are a bigger factor, but not necessarily. And I wished I‚Äôd known that earlier‚ÄîI‚Äôd made assumptions about good looking men because ‚Äúthey‚Äôd never go for a girl like me‚Äù and I‚Äôd been bitter about it in my younger years. 

They can go for you if you think they‚Äôre out of your league. Leagues mean nothing, it‚Äôs high school drama that won‚Äôt exist once you mature. People are interested in like minded people. 

End rant. "
351,"I think I almost laughed to death. Your dad really thinks the South is Liberal? My state may end up voting for a woman who is literally a corporate shill and only because she is a ‚Äúalways Trumper‚Äù

355,"Staying somewhere after you‚Äôve said good bye. One night in university, I had friends over from class. The last one to leave was this guy I didn‚Äôt know as well. He was only invited because he was there when we made the plans. 

It didn‚Äôt matter how many times I hinted I was tired and wanted to go to sleep (I made sure to say sleep rather than bed). I would walk toward the door and stand there awkwardly while he kept making conversation from my couch. Then, he decided he needed to help me clean up everything. I kept telling him I‚Äôd prefer to do it in the morning and I had to wake up early. 

I lived by myself at the time and with him not leaving, I felt completely powerless. If I asked him forcefully, I was worried he might react. I ended up texting some friends and asking them to come back to get him. They lied and said they forgot something and then said to him ‚Äúhey, let‚Äôs all walk out together!‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know if he was just friendly, or hoping something more would happen. He knew I had a long distance boyfriend that I was very happy with. I just remember being very afraid. "

I was the only person he trusted to not betray him or feed him poison, or inject him with cyanide in his sleep, and so forth, and he said that even though he knew I wasn't his mother, he knew I loved him and always would. Nothing I said would convince him otherwise, and his sad face and the, ""It doesn't matter - I'll still call you Mum because that's how I see you anyway,"" broke my damn heart. I think I cried on and off for a month. 

Two years later, he was recovering and he started crying and said he didn't believe that anymore and he was so sorry for hurting me with that delusion. That broke my heart again, because he was so upset he'd thought these things.

380,"I can't share pics, but someone I know decided to do a pregnancy shoot in the middle of a curve on a two lane road. She had enormous, 2 1/2 gallon  breasts *before* the pregnancy, so by 32 weeks her stomach still hadn't caught up. 


&amp;nbsp;


So she's lying on her back in the middle of a sharp curve with 3 huge lumps, each going in a different direction. She also attempted a dreamy look, which was the most vacant gaze I'd ever seen on a living person. Someone had the foresight to block the road with a beat up Chevy Cavelier with a busted headlight and missing bumper, which made a cameo in the pics. 

&amp;nbsp;


My mother, the least catty person I've ever known, called and asked if S had been caught stealing melons and died after a car chase.

381,"Hoo boy, here we go.

My Borderline PD manifests as a hair-trigger temper, paranoia and mistrust of relationships, overanalyzing the meaning of what someone says (i.e. ""you look fine."" ""JUST fine???""), wild shifts in mood (from euphoric and overly optimistic to deeply depressed), dissociation, projection, rapid cycling thoughts, self-loathing, etc. I'm fortunate to have a spouse and long-term friendships that have survived many ups and downs, but it took many years of suffering through it before I finally sought therapy and medication. That combination was so important, as meds without therapy wouldn't address the root causes, but therapy without meds was still lacking something. Abilify has made a night and day difference in my ability to function somewhat normally--my marriage and friendships have greatly improved, and the voice in my head telling me what a monstrous piece of shit I am has quieted more than I ever thought possible, reappearing only in times of major stress. I wouldn't say I'm completely recovered or ""over it,"" and I think it will always be a part of me, but with time and treatment I've found a greater peace of mind than I have ever known. 

For those who are still trapped in the cycle of suffering, you are NOT beyond help or hope. DM me if you need someone to talk to and I'll help however I can. "
382,Oxford commas matter 
383,"I think a big one is how we deal with our own internalized misogyny, racism, classism, etc.

I don't wear makeup. But I dye my brows and lashes. (I have black hair, having blond brows and lashes looks SO BAD.) 

I have had classmates (always male) actually argue with me about this. It's like it's the same thing when I tell them that makeup isn't my thing, but not the same thing when they're low key shaming me for not wearing makeup."
385,"My boyfriend of 4 years ghosted me. 

I‚Äôm 25. We lived together. I thought we were going to get married soon. In my opinion everything was seemingly fine besides the occasional distance from each other but I just thought that was the ‚Äúhoney moon phase‚Äù ending..  One day when I was at work He took everything of value and moved it into the house of a girl he had met on tinder who I didn‚Äôt know about. He blocked my number and ignored me for about 2 months. I couldn‚Äôt afford anything by myself during this time because all of the bills were shared. Looking back During those years everything was always going in my name and he used my credit cards promising to help pay everything back. Turns out he was making trips to the casino without me knowing, sleeping around with girls from tinder, stole over 30,000 from his dad while he was out of town and gambled it away and bought things for girls he was seeing. 

This whole time I had no idea I was with a con artist. It fucked me up pretty good. Really the only thing that kept me from killing myself A couple of times was wanting to see my nephew grow up and my cat. It‚Äôs been about a year and a half since and I still have bad flashbacks and commitment issues. The scary thing is I heard the new girl he is with bought a brand new truck with him immediately. I always think about warning her but idk if it‚Äôs my place and I‚Äôm too scared to have him in my life in any form again. 

I‚Äôm making more money now but the debt was too overwhelming and I filed bankruptcy last month. I also met a man that is treating me really well, but I‚Äôm hoping this time warning signs will be more clear to me. He is responsible and does well for himself but I still am terrified of getting hurt again. "
