0,People who put glass floors or walkways in buildings don't take into account that some people might have to walk across them while wearing skirts and dresses.
1,People will treat you the way you let them.
2,"You cannot convince someone to be with you if they don't want to be. Cut your losses, move on."
3,"21 years later, and he's just as thoughtful as year 1. We have a high school freshman and a 6th grader as as children as well. We both work full time.

*  Greets me at the door with coffee and ibuprofen if I text him about a bad day at work. (I work 12+ hour shifts and always get home later than him, but I have more days off.)

* Makes dinner without me asking if I had a bad day, even if it's my night to cook. Doesn't ask for me to make it up.

* Randomly texts me pictures of things he finds beautiful...sunrises, flowers art, woodworking...

* Is supportive with poor mental health days and treats it as kindly as he would a physical illness, like bringing me food, doing chores, or dealing with the kids. Never issues a judgement, even if the mental slump is a long one.

* Never holds a grudge. If I mess up and we address and settle it, I never hear about it again, even if in a future fight, the past may be relevant.

* No matter how busy he is, if I tell him I want to talk, even if it's just venting, he stops and focuses on the conversation.

* He has always pulled his weight around the house and with childcare. I never had to ask...babies got changed and fed while I slept, vomit gets cleaned up, floor get vacuumed, laundry gets done...we both carry the weight, but he just does it without asking.

* He has always fought fair, and because of how proactive he is, we actually rarely fight. I honestly cannot remember our last fight, and it's not because we are perfect, it's because we communicate before things can get big.

* He believes in growth and change, which is why we are still together. We met at age 14, so if we both had not firmly believed that growth and change are important values, we wouldn't have lasted past the first few years (together since 17, married since 21)."
4,"As an architect, this is something that frustrates me, since some of my colleagues don’t get it. 

When I point this out, a common response is “why don’t they just wear pants then?” Failing to realise that:

1. Someone might not know that there is a glass floor if they’ve never been there before.

2. Some women don’t wear pants due to religious reasons, and some very large women struggle to find pants that fit.

3. Most importantly, a building should accommodate the people who use it, not the other way around. That includes the women who use the building. "
5,Those visitor badges with clips that are meant to fit perfectly on a suit jacket’s front pocket and basically nowhere else. I never know where to put it and it drives me freaking nuts. 
6,"Backpacks with straps at the front. They are exactly at breast hight.

&amp;#x200B;

People who learn CPR only learn it on a male dummy, so people don't know where to put their hands for women because they don't want to touch the breasts."
7,"If someone wants to make you their villain, just say yikes and move tf on."
8,"No matter how much you trust someone or what kind of relationship you have with them, you should never lend money unless you're prepared to never get it back."
9,"-Use cold water on your hair when you wash it-it really does make a difference. I used to think it was BS until I tried it.

-Doing an occasional Apple cider Vinegar rinse (2 parts ACV, 1 part water) can add wonderful shine and volume to your hair, in addition to cleansing your scalp. Don't do this more than once a week though.

-Sleep! It really does make a difference in your skin quality. Not quick, but cheap :).

-Working out-lots of free videos on youtube. When you feel confident with your body, you'll instantly look better no matter what you're wearing or how your styled.

-Hydrogen peroxide mixed with water makes for mouthwash that whitens your teeth. Whiter and brighter teeth instantly make anyone look more put together. Just be careful with getting the proportions right so you don't screw up the enamel of your teeth.

-Leave yourself 10 extra minutes to get ready in the morning if you can, no matter your morning routine you'll always look more put together if you don't start out your day being rushed.

-If you can afford it, pick up a nail care kit at your local drugstore and do polish free manicures and pedicures at home.

-If you can invest in anything beauty wise, go for the best quality moisturizer you can afford and purchase a lip balm, eyebrow pencil and concealer or foundation. Having hydrated skin, a ""good base"" and groomed eyebrows is your best bet for minimal products to achieve a ""put together"" look. Only buy products from places with good return policies and try to get samples before buying if possible.

-Check out the frugal subreddit, I'll bet they have some tips."
10,"Seats and head rests in cars. They are meant for larger people who never put their hair in ponytails. It results in a lot of back and neck discomfort for me, as I drive 2.5 hours round trip daily. "
11,"I have a larger nose. Not horrible but definitely bigger than the cute noses most girls have. Was bullied a lot for it growing up, told I should get a nose job, etc

Not once in my adult life has anyone mentioned it to me nor has it stopped men from finding me attractive. Used to be something I was extremely self conscious about when taking pictures — barely pay any mind to it now."
12,I'm friends with my coworkers to the point that I had to go out of my way to invite non-work friends to my birthday so it wouldn't just turn into a staff meeting with cake.
13,"Pay attention to warning signs and red flags. Don’t be afraid to cancel or postpone a wedding to give yourself more time. 

Being married to the wrong person is miserable. Being married to the right person is amazing. "
14,"PPE. 

&amp;#x200B;

Labcoats do not close properly overbust, and are usually too broad in the shoulder and waist, creating safety hazard. Using them when pregnant is impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disposable gloves are theoretically available in smaller sizes, just routinely not present in the lab/stores.  


Glovebox gloves are one-size-fits-no-one, are way too big and placed too high for most women (I'm tall, no issue with height for me, but my students often use step-stools, which isn't 100% safe).  


Breathing apparatus and other types of face masks have rubbers straps not suited when you have long hair - you can't tie the hair underneath, as the strap needs to fit snugly, you can't have the hair loose, as it's not safe to work like that.  


Shared cleanroom overalls and overboots are from men-medium size up.  


Unless you're a frequent user of any of those things and you order your customised equipment for yourself, using the shared stuff is either impossible or not safe."
15,Your comment reminded me of this article from last year: [Wanted: male architect willing to navigate his own building in a skirt](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-male-design-in-architecture-20180714-story.html)
16,And not the way you treat them.
17,"Reading all these comments about how it's more socially acceptable now, and that's what I thought too, and then last year I went out with my friend and wore a new shirt for the first time, one of those that you can't really wear a bra with. Well we went into this restaurant and it was rather cold, and I have never been ogled so badly in my life. I felt so uncomfortable, I couldn't talk to anyone without them staring directly at my chest, not me. I made it just through the meal and then rushed home and changed. 

I wish I had the ""I don't care if people stare"" mentality, but I just don't, it makes me too uncomfortable, so for now I still wear at least a bralette to cover up a little bit more. I was so discouraged after that though, it was awful."
18,There was a case of this in the UK a while ago where a paramedic didn't administer first aid and/or shock the woman to 'protect her modesty' cause he didn't want to touch or expose her breasts. She died.
19,"I'm like a board with nipples, so as long as I'm wearing a thick top I'm good."
20,"To never ever take my health for granted. Exercise, eat your veggies, sleep enough, learn to manage stress. Stress can really ruin your health. If you don't have time to take care of yourself all the more reason to. Make time, no matter what.   
Work is always there to do, but your health may not always be there. And what will you do if your health runs out and you can't work anymore?"
21,Be more diligent about researching majors/fields of education in high school
22,"Small boobs. 

I love them, they love me. 

And I don't give a fuck, 
if they aren't your cup of tea."
23,You are the only common denominator in your own repeated problems.
24,"I send back explicit gay porn.

The response is always, ""WTF why would you send me that?!"""
25,Winter coats. Apparently I'm supposed to prefer looking cute over freezing to death. 
26,Certain pieces of gym equipment smash the hell out of my breasts and it's very uncomfortable.
27,"I frequently lay in bed and agonize over stupid shit I've done. 

Or I get too excited about fun things coming up that I can't sleep."
28,"I'm a pretty solitary person, but do get lonely sometimes  and it can be tough. Today I'm having a bit of a lonely day, Sundays can usually be tough as this is the day I have the most downtime and will think about it. I go on Reddit and talk to people, try to immerse myself in something that will make me not dwell on it like reading, go for a walk and listen to a podcast, or just get out of my place for a bit."
29,"My answer: stretch marks. They seem to be near-universally reviled, but I can confidently, honestly say mine don't bother me. 

I have them everywhere in varying degrees: arms, waist, hips, thighs...

I dunno. I feel like they tell a story. I just don't mind.

Some I even LIKE because they came about due to gained muscle tone."
30,"I've gone to home improvement stores many time to look for heavier-duty work gloves, like Mechanix. All of the gloves were men's, unless they were specifically gardening gloves. The smallest sizes were way too big for women with smaller hands. I guess we don't work with our hands? "
31,Sent a pic of my cat’s asshole back one time. Asked him if he liked my pussy. Never heard from him again. 
32,"We’re friendly, but not friends. I prefer to keep work and home lives separate."
33,"I don’t know about the general population but I’ve certainly seen a lot of youtubers and instagram posters (who are already young and beautiful) getting Botox, fillers and other cosmetic procedures. It seems like it is pretty much expected for them at this point. It’s disconcerting."
34,"Not necessarily an everyday object, but pretty significant: Western Labor and Delivery practices. 

The supine position—what genius thought that should be standard? Easier for the doctor, sure, but compresses everything that desperately needs to be open."
35,"I have trouble calling it rape because it barely affected me. Technically yes I was raped but i don’t feel like other rape victims, so I just kinda moved on. "
36,"I immerse myself in learning. A nice side-effect: As you become good in something, you inevitably begin to connect with other people who are also doing this ""something""."
37,"***MEDICINE*** 

&amp;#x200B;

Not including women in medical trials for decades has biased medicine, medical treatments, and outcomes against women. Even female complaints of pain are frequently overlooked by male doctors. We as a society are struggling to catch up to treating women effectively.

38,Being pale. Lots of ways to temporary change it and now I just own it 
39,"Also, if you have to convince someone to be with you in the first place, you shouldn't be with them. You should both want each other mutually."
40,"""you must have confused me with someone who won't show this to everyone.""  

Oh he suddenly became very aware of boundaries and respect when it was about him. Didn't give a thought when it was about mine though....hmm..... (I didn't send it to everyone but it made him squirm and be uncomfortable and that is a valuable experience). "
41,I don't even feel like I qualify to post here because I *still* have trouble calling it rape or sexual assault.
42,"Cellulite.

I have it on my upper legs and butt. Couldn’t care less. "
43,"I have big boobs and my nipples get hard at the drop of a hat, so I only go out bra less if I’m in a baggy hoodie/sweatshirt, or if I’m wearing a bathing suit under my clothes to go to the beach or whatever."
44,"Well, an ex, but I still think of it fondly. I bought a shelf for my nail polish and hadn’t had time to hang it or organize them. Completely unprompted when I was gone one weekend, he hung the shelf and lined them up, organizing them by color. My love language is acts of service, and this just blew me away.

Unfortunately the good was few and far between... but that memory is still a nice one :) "
45,"How controlling people can be. If you feel like you have to watch every little thing you say because that person will dump you in a heartbeat just for disagreeing with them, that’s not your friend. That’s a thought police warden. Leave those people behind."
46,Exactly! There are some conservative fields like law in which many women are strongly discouraged from wearing pants in lieu of skirt suits - and one of the real examples someone mentioned here is a *courthouse*! 
47,uhhmmm.. are we not going to talk about pockets? 
48,"Guys will think you're a prude, easy, or stay interested whether you sleep with them or not. Make sure you make that decision for yourself, not what they could think of you."
49,"So I was in Trader Joes picking up a few things and it was the hottest part of the summer. I was wearing an Old Navy tank top -- the brand is important because if you've ever owned an Old Navy tank top, you'll know they are nearly transparent the fabric is so thin. I do not care. It's Sunday, I just need wine, and I am not putting on a bra to drive three miles to buy wine. 

Turns out, Trader Joes is the coldest place in Florida. It's colder than Macy's or AMC theaters. LOL. Still don't care, I'm at the checkout and the guy cashier says to me, ""It sure is cold in here."" And I said, ""Yep, I can't wait to get outside to thaw out."" And he chuckles and says no more. Just as I'm finishing my transaction, I realize what he is getting at. Both nips -- even the inverted one -- are standing at high attention because of course, you could hang meat inside a Trader Joes. Finally, I glance down at my chest, wink at him, and say, ""You're welcome. Have a great afternoon!"" And then I turn and flounce out of TJs like it's my job. 

I still think that story is hilarious."
50,Friendly at work but otherwise no. It's like at work we can talk about anything. But once we're outside of work they can only talk about work. I hate that place. Please do not bring it up on my free time. I hate staff parties and anything where there will be too many of my coworkers.
51,"Hip Dips! I'm seeing an increasing number of fitspos recommending exercises to get rid of hip dips, despite the fact that it's a physiology issue that can't be fixed!

I quite like mine :)"
52,I’ve never done this but one of my favorites is to freak out and ask why they send you a child’s penis. 
53,"my boobs are way too big for that. even when i was smaller chested i wore some kind of undergarment just to protect the nipples from chafing

idc what other people do"
54,There are studies showing offices are generally kept at temperatures that are comfortable for men but cold for women.
55,"If someone tries to leave, let them."
56,The ballistic or bullet proof vests the military uses do not keep breasts and wider hips in mind for women so they are extremely uncomfortable and don’t fit safely in my opinion. 
57,"Arm hair.  Unlike other types of body hair, arm hair is so soft and unproblematic.  Why complicate things with trying to remove it?"
58,"Artificial hearts were only able to be used in men (and some models still say they fit all men and like 50% of women) because they were too big to fit in women’s chests 

The original designs were made with pretty much only men in mind 
"
59,"I have difficulty calling it rape because it started out consensual. And while it very quickly turned into me saying no and him doing stuff anyways (followed by violence and not letting me leave), I have a hard time. Nor did it necessarily affect me. I have moments, but nothing debilitating. 


I also kinda just went along with everything he did, as a means of self preservation. So in my head, because I wasn’t resisting, I can’t really wrap my head around the victim mentally"
60,"I don't care if other people do it, but I won't. My clothing fits better when I wear the expected undergarments, and I wear a large enough cup size that wandering around without a bra is uncomfortable."
61,"I've never read anything more true than something to this effect: ""A relationship isn't always 50/50. Sometimes you feel like a 20, so your partner should pull 80. Sometimes your partner feels 20 and then it's your turn to pull 80."" Something like that.

There's something special about hearing each other and understanding each other. I had a long, busy day yesterday, and my fiance made dinner, did the chores, cleaned up. I didn't even ask him. I didn't even say thank you until this morning when I realized, and I just told him how much I appreciate him. He heard me and responded in such a caring way. I try my best to do the same."
62,"I'm gonna say shaving supplies. All the ""women's"" razors are designed for fine/thin/easy body hair and leaves us ladies with thick/tough hair frustrated. I use the women's Schick Quattro which has 4 blades and while it works, I can feel it struggling to cut the hair.  

I also have sensitive skin and all the women's shaving creams I've tried irritated it. I switched to the Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Gel and it made a complete difference."
63,"Ugh and I hate ""women's"" graphic tees. They are essentially lower quality fabric (ie: see through) with those stupid baby doll sleeves. Just give me a normal tshirt."
64,Marriage is one of the decisions I’ve made that I’m most happy about. Been married just over 6 years now and although a lot has happened during that time I love my husband now more than I did when we first said “I do”. Our wedding was wonderful but the best part has been our relationship growing as we’ve navigated through life together.
65,i make up stories in my head with people that don't exist and i create worlds and situations and challenges for those characters and i can easily do that for 5 hours straight non stop
66,I’m a huge nerd and I like wearing nerdy shirts. The problem is I’m a DD so any shirt I wear the pattern is stretched unless it’s for women. But all the woman’s shorts don’t have any shounen (manga/anime targeted to men) characters and just the female characters. Not that I don’t like the female characters but usually the boy characters are written better and more likable. 
67,I know a woman who gave birth on all fours and a woman who did it squatting. They had different docs and were suggested to do that by both docs (both male) after having difficulty on their backs. Hopefully this means that they’re moving away from the standard position.
68,Seat-belts.  The inventor of the seat belt is an asshole.  They never accounted for breasts.  So uncomfortable. 
69,What. The. Actual. FUCK. 
70,Your pants have pockets??
71,"Well at least she died with her modesty in tact! Priorities. /s

That is so messed up and sad. "
72,"I felt like that recently when I went to the grocery store braless. It wasn't the nips, I had a thick t-shirt on, it was the jiggling. But the stares were excruciating."
73,There are still judges in this country who will chastise a woman lawyer for wearing pants in their courtroom. Not to mention the school dress codes that require girls’ uniforms be skirt-only
74,Medication
75,Urine specimen tubes at the doctor's. It's so hard trying to aim whilst you're sitting and not piss all over your hand at the same time. They were definitely designed for men.
76,"I like being married to the person I am married to.  You don't marry ""marriage"".    


Marriage is not a one size fits all institution.  Marriages are as unique as the two people who enter into them.  Your marriage does not have to follow a pattern or fit into anyone else's definition of marriage.  It is like water...it takes on the shape of the container you give it and your container is up to you.  


It's important you understand the legal rights and obligations you enter into....because those practical applications do have an effect on love.  


A marriage may start with a wedding but a wedding is not the marriage.  You do not need any expense to start a marriage.  If being married to the right person meant wearing burlap and saying ""I do"" in a pig barn, you'd be glad to do it.  The right wedding doesn't validate love or marriage."
77,Some I can't even adjust for my height :( It's like they don't think short people want to use machines too!
78,"Making sure I hang/fold/put away my clothes fast enough after washing, so they avoid wrinkles. 

Finding the right shade of lipstick or gloss. 

Learning a few quick easy hairstyles on YouTube."
79,Somehow it's been decided that women can only appear dressed up if they are wearing torture devices on their feet.
80,"holy shit you're right, we only work on male dummies."
81,"Listen to your gut, the little voice nagging you that you don't want to listen to. Most of the time that instinct is going to lead you to the correct place and avoid hardships."
82,I honestly wish I'd taken a gap year or something instead of jumping right in.
83,"Here are some things my s/o does that I greatly appreciate:

* Cleaning and tidying up without being asked
* Does roughly half of the cooking
* Rubs my butt while I fall asleep
* Hangs out with me in the shower 
* Lets me peep on him when he showers (it's cuter than it sounds, I promise)
* Brings my coffee/tea to me in bed when I'm having trouble getting up
* Whenever I forget something in the car, he jumps up to get it
* Gives me little shoulder rubs when I seem tense
* Waits on me hand and foot when I'm sick or having a bad period
* Puts his phone calls on speaker if he's talking to someone funny so I don't miss any jokes"
84,"Bathroom stalls that must be designed by men,  where you have to straddle the toilet just to close the stall door.  Double whammy when there is no hook in the stall to hang your purse on. "
85,"My office uses magnetic nametags, which I love."
86,"I definitely feel weird doing it unless I'm in a ton of layers. I might run out on a quick errand bra-less in a sweatshirt, but that's about it.

Don't care if other people do, though. Wear (or don't wear) what makes you comfortable."
87,"It feels like most tools aren't designed for women. I'm hardly queen of DIY, but when something breaks I like to try fixing it myself if it seems relatively simple, it helps me learn. But trying to use like my ratchet set or screwdriver is difficult, because the handles are just thick enough to make them uncomfortable to use. And forget my drill, I pretty much have to hold that in two hands to feel safe with it.

And then when you look at the \~for ladies\~ delicate prissy baby pink tool sets, they're all flimsy nonsense that fall apart after half a use. "
88,"My sister was once flashed. Her smart comeback that made the creep run away?

“Oh, poor boy!  It’s deformed!”"
89,"I did. It was my then-boyfriend, it wasn’t violent, and I didn’t verbally say no even though I obviously did not want to (I kept saying no every other time he wanted to have sex and this time he essentially stood by the door saying I had to have sex with him because I was his gf). So I let him got on top of me and I just laid there crying. I still have a hard time calling it that even though two previous therapists have told me it was. I mean, it was, I just can’t get myself to say it because I think people would think I’m lying or that it was my fault because I technically didn’t say “no.”"
90,"Basic office furniture. Unless you have adjustable ergonomic equipment to supplement it, desks are generally too high, which cause the keyboard and mouse to be too high and there for you'll probably make your chair higher than it should be to reach it, etc."
91,Send them random penis pics back that I find on the net
92,"When I was in EMT school we were lucky enough to have an instructor that brought his super pregnant wife in on various occasions to practice stuff on. All the guys got really flustered and our instructor would just say, “Yup, those are breasts, as discussed in the anatomy unit” and we were able to learn finding intercostal spaces etc on a pregnant woman. "
93,"This this this. Double if it's family, because the more you try to collect, other family members get involved and start trying to convince you to let it go, because faaaaamily.  ""You know how she is..."" and yeah, I guess I did. I was just hoping for better. But hope doesn't get you paid back. 

This also goes for favorite books.  I rebought the same book three times before I stopped lending it out, and just recommending it."
94,We're 9-5 friends. We chat and have lunch together but we won't stay in touch after we leave the company.
95,"Same here. I remember seeing him once, while I was at work, and totally unexpectedly started panicking.

I confided in my coworker (waitress) and she didn’t seem bothered so I pulled myself together pretty quickly. 

As I was drunk I only remember snapshots and that doesn’t affect me. Whereas other rape victims have a horrendous time. I wouldn’t want to categorise myself with them and act like I understand any of their pain. "
96,Pubes. 
97,"You would probably like r/Instagramreality it really addresses this head on. 

Im a new mom and have several mom support groups I am involved with on various social media platforms. I started to notice women posting pictures of their weight loss after giving birth and it was pretty drastic. I gained about 70 unforgiving pounds during my pregnancy and breastfeeding feeding. I was a mess over it. One girl who I was close to was posting pictures of herself a month after giving birth skinnier than her already petite pre pregnancy size. I started researching everything from crazy drastic diets to liposuction, desperate to fix my body. 

One day something in me clicked, I started to forgive myself for being fat and let go of the anger and started looking for positive body affirmations when I found Instagram realities. I spent about 3 days of looking at the sub and evaluating all of the photoshopped and facetuned people. Then I went back to the pictures and really looked at them. It was so obvious in retrospect, the warped walls, pencil thin noses, super white teeth, and blurred complexions. It made my heart hurt so much to see these women for what they were, hurting, just like me. Im still fat but I'm working on it. I sort of got off on a tangent but I hope this helps answer your question."
98,"When you're upset, it's easy to react with anger, but that rarely will get you the results you want. So take a moment to breathe before reacting when you feel like lashing out."
99,"After the second guy I dated after the man who tried to kill me started hitting me as well. I didn't cause their bahaviour, but I am not a passive character in my own life. 

I took some time to be alone and assess what made me vulnerable. I worked on my self esteem. I continued therapy. 

I cleansed my dating palate, I suppose. I realised we lost the art of dating along the way and 'do steady' too easily and my picker was off. I began to said yes to any coffee date from any kind person regardless of my interest to expose myself to more types of people and healthy connections. Even when there was no chemistry, the next time I met someone I did click, I'd remember something like how much more respectful the other person had been and realise there was a better option out there."
100,"To piggyback on this — descriptions of illness can be biased towards men, too. Off of the top of my head, women experience both heart attacks and ADHD differently than men do. With the former, many women have died after being misdiagnosed because they’re not showing the “classic” (male) symptoms of a myocardial infarction. With ADHD, many women struggle to get a clear diagnosis and treatment plan for the same reason! I am sure there are other instances, too."
101,"In line with that, most sofas/couches are uncomfortable for me. My head hits on the area where the neck support is, thus forcing my head forward. It’s so uncomfortable and I have to shift around a lot. Buying a new sofa was such a pain."
102,Check equine stores. You can always trust crazy horse girls to have the good stuff.
103,"I'm baffled at the idea people push that it's unhygienic. How, exactly? And how come pubic and armpit hair are only unhygienic for women?"

108,"He battles our kitty every morning to make the bed because I told him when we first started dating that I love crawling into a made bed at the end of the day. He also makes me coffee every morning while I get ready for work, and stays until I'm done so we can chat and leave for work at the same time."
109,"I've heard that they apparently don't do medication trials on women at all. It was a problem with Ambien because they just calculated a women's dose as ""smaller men's dose"" which lead to many women having too high of a dose because women are not just small men. "
110,"Might be controversial given its current status, but Friends. It’s still hilarious but now that I’m older I realize holy cow these people are big time enablers/toxic as hell to each other."
111,"To be honest, probably most of them. If it isn't considered a woman-specific use object, it was not likely designed based on the ""average human"" metrics which have traditionally (and often still currently) been based on men. "
112,I’m so fair that you can see my veins all through my body and I don’t mind. The backs of my knees are mostly a jumble of blue and green veins and I used to be so self-conscious but now IDGAF. My colleagues nicknamed me “gecko” which I think is cute now
113,"Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.

Life becomes easier when you learn to accept an apology you never got."
114,"I'm pretty newly married, but this is how my husband has been since I met him and I hope he never changes. It's amazing to always feel loved, supported, and thought about. In a lot of my relationships I've felt like I was the one who had to put in all the work, and with him, I feel like I'm the one who has to try to keep up! lol. I appreciate him so much. "
115,"And then when I, as a hairy gorilla male, wear a skirt, it's all ""that's disgusting"" and ""no one wants to see that"".

Skirts and pants for all, I say. "
116,"Freakin' kitchen cabinets!  I can use the first shelf and the front of the second, but the rest is useless.  Definitely not designed for those of us who are vertically-challenged, and women tend to be shorter than men.

It's especially weird because ""a woman's place is in the kitchen,"" but they build cabinets we can barely use."
117,"I wish that going braless wasn’t considered a “small boob” option. Just because i have big boobs, its considered obscene or really sexual if I don’t wear a bra. But also fuck it, because bras are terrible and I’m not wearing one unless I’m running."
118,"""Thanks, but I'm into thicker dicks.""

Granted, the dude spent the next 3 days arguing on and off that his dick was plenty thick enough, which somehow led to me asking if he was also a ""purveyor of dicks with the same hands-on experience as me"", but at least the pics stopped."
119,"I hate how bathrooms for women always have just as many stalls as the men's, despite the fact that women usually take longer and there is always a queue outside the women's, but not the men's."
120,"Recently there was workspace safety inspection at work.   Among the potential fire hazards that were noted in the report was all the use of space heaters (used exclusively by women, as it turns out).  The \[all male\] operations and facility folks declared no one could use space heaters anymore, and this led to workplace version of a riot: the women were *not* happy and they let it be known.

(Keep in mind that these women are also using blankets to cover their legs, wearing cardigans/jackets at their desks, and gloves, too....they're doing everything they can to stay warm.)

Long story short: the highest-ranking women intervened, and the space heaters were allowed to stay."

122,I was in the bathing suit area at Target last week and one of the marketing signs showed a woman in a bathing suit and they didn’t airbrush the cellulite! It was like a real person was wearing a bathing suit and still confident af about it. I was so happy.
123,"This... car seats are made for the average man, which means they are too deep. If I sit with my back flush to the chair's back, my head tilts forward and my knees are too far back to bend. "
124,"I actually think there's something wrong with highly religious people. Like, *actually wrong.* It's not just a ""I disagree with them."" thing. I think people who are willing to do things like harming others (including their own children) for religious reasons are inhuman."
125,unpainted fingernails. i find that having my nails done all the time is not only inconvenient but also very expensive.
126,I just finished a giant backpack hunt and the front boob straps problem was the worst. I was frustrated and furious and when I found one that lets you adjust the height of those straps (so they can go above the boobs) the store only carried it in pink. I decided to just be a pink hiker and roll with it. 
127,"My Mum always told me, ""you can't make someone love you, you can only make them respect you"". This advice really helped me when my partner asked for space early in our relationship. It meant that I hadn't embarrassed myself when we eventually came back together after working through some personal stuff, and he still had respect for me."
128,"Cars in general. Standard crash test dummies are modeled after an average man, there were no dummies based on women until the early 2000s and even now i don't think they are widely used because their use in tests even as a passenger drop car safety ratings sharply.

Women mostly drive in an ""unideal"" position so we can see mirrors, each pedals, etc because we otherwise can't. "
129,"1. Maybe an unpopular opinion, but **lay off the alcohol**. Booze does your appearance no favors, let alone your overall wellbeing... or your pocketbook. Fun story: I will forever have a nasty scar right between my eyebrows because of an unfortunate drunken run-in (literally) with a wall. :-( Also, hangovers are just the worst. Talk about feeling haggard. 

2. Stay hydrated! It makes SUCH a difference in your physical appearance, energy level, mental clarity, etc. I'm going to get myself another glass of water right now, in fact. 

3. Homemade face masks and other spa-day DIYs to pamper yourself. I've been using aloe vera gel, yogurt, and a little grapeseed oil, but you can look up recipes online and cater them to your skin type. (I'm really loving aloe vera gel for my skin. I just get the cheap drugstore stuff--but look for minimal extra ingredients. I even make a DIY lotion just by mixing aloe vera gel with a little oil--it mixes up nice and creamy.) 

4. Learn how to groom your brows. Tidying up my brows makes a big difference in how put-together I think I look. 

5. Exercise. 

6. Posture."
130,"I did this thinking it was no big deal but yes, I had 3 separate men tell me I'm beautiful. I had just woken up, my hair was a rats nest, and my mascara from the night before was atrocious. It was so different from a regular trip to the grocery store and  made me soooo uncomfortable"
131,"Not techhhhnically a movie but Snape's obsession with Lily was weird and not the slightest bit romantic. I cringe whenever I see people with ""always"" tattoos or using that reference in their engagements/weddings/whatever."
132,"Good for you for not giving in. Not that I'm shaming people for having nose jobs, but it's awesome that you personally were able to accept it. "
133,Every negative situation is an opportunity for you to grow and learn.
134,It’s a big reason diversity in the workplace is so important. We all have blind spots! It’s good to be surrounded by a team that can help you find yours.
135,"That's what I did the only time it's happened! I went ""OMG that's sick, you know child porn is illegal right?!"""
136,"""I'm not like other girls!""

Nah, I'm 100% like other girls and it is awesome!"
137,"I think you should have whatever name you want. I'm estranged from my parents and didn't have much of an emotional connection to my name, so I preferred to take my husband's. "
138,Hoes before Bros doesn’t have to apply if your friend is a manipulative jerk face.  Don’t ever feel like a bad person for choosing a relationship that makes you happy and healthy.
139,"Pretty much everything. I admit, I hardly notice it because I'm used to things being uncomfortable or difficult. When I read that article, it was eye opening realizing that I've just learned to ignore these daily issues. "
140,"I'm a male architect. When I was first starting out, I worked on a building where we had called for a perforated metal tread, open riser stair in a pretty public area. That got nixed when the female PM brought up exactly this concern. I never would have even considered it. Now I think about it on every project I work on."
141,One time I sent dick pics back to the guy and he just spammed me with a ton more saying “ooooohhhhh you like dick a lot!”. 
142,"Nights. Nights are difficult. The time when the world is quiet. No one to discuss the day and share meaningful conversation at days end. 

I really don’t have a solution for that. There are 1,000 ways to distract, I suppose but it’s still there. I figure there is a lesson always and eventually it will present itself if I’m willing to see."
143,"I have large boobs, they have never been perky. No fucks given about my lightly saggy boobs. "
144,"I have extremely thick and long natural afro hair. I've always worn it out, didn't feel like myself with it straightened and I actually think my hair is pretty.

I was viciously mocked for it for years, adults would point and laugh at me as a kid. People would reach out and yank it cause they thought it was a wig. 
Was told recently by a colleague that I'd never be pretty until I relaxed it or cut it off.

I don't care. I think it's great and I'm lucky to have such interesting hair, even if it is a shit show to take care of."
145,"A guy sent me a pic of his dick when i was like 16 and then asked for pics of me, I told him I was 11 and needed to ask my mum if it was okay first. He freaked the fuck out "
146,"I do actually prefer the softer fabrics and different necklines of women's t-shirts, but I'm totally with you on the babydoll sleeves. Who likes those?? They cut into your arm, they get all bunched up into your armpit and thus soaked in deodorant, and they don't even look good!"
147,I want people to send me Duck pics
148,I sleep with my arms and legs off the side of the bed and don't fear the boogeyman.
149,"For me personally, I can’t stand the feeling of pubes. Discharge and period blood stick to pubes and get all matted and gross. It’s not so bad clean shaven. Of course you wash daily, but in between washing it still feels icky. 

That being said, I definitely don’t think women should *have* to shave. Do what you want with your own body. 

Some people even tell me I can’t be a feminist because I shave. Lol."
150,"I'm very small-framed: skinny with little boobs, little waist, and little butt. I've heard many an ""only dogs go for bones"" and ""men like *meat""* directed at me throughout my life by well-meaning people, and I don't care.

Finding clothes that fit me is a pain and it's easier to get things custom-made, but I was made this way and I don't feel like getting implants or a Brazilian butt lift to change that."
151,"The US is hung up about this.

In other countries it's fairly common for three generations to live under the same roof."
152,"I've heard it's because they wouldn't want to risk harm to a fetus if any of the women on a drug trial got pregnant. Which I get that if the woman wanted to keep the baby that would be tragic; but it ignores that there are sterile women, IUD's exist, and some women don't want babies and also perpetuates the idea that the wellbeing of a fetus is more important than the wellbeing of adult women."
153,"Yup. It’s totally rooted in sexism and yet so many women buy into it - “I just feel *cleaner* with no pubes!” But they’re there to protect your vag, they’re not dirty or gross. I mean, each to their own, but I think we gotta admit that the pre-pubescent look is costly, irritating, and definitely not how nature intended it. "
154,"“I don’t know who had this number last, but you sent this to my 13 year old daughter.”"
155,Jealous of smaller bra designs :(
156,"This!! I've been doing research at my university for years now and I have never, ever found a lab coat that could button comfortably over my bust but still had sleeves short enough so that I'm not knocking things over. I've started just wearing barrier coats regularly because they're the only ones that will at least button most of the way. Also the respirators I use can be awkward or uncomfortable to wear because of my hair and I feel like they don't sit properly half the time :/ Honesty if I had a dollar for every time my lab coat spontaneously unbuttoned at my bust when I sat down at my desk or bench, I'd have enough money to buy custom-sized coats and respirators lol "
157,It's honestly ridiculous that they decided to keep the hazards instead of just turning down the goddamn AC a little bit.
158,"Also seat belts, aka boob stranglers."
159,Top loading washing machines. I have always smashed my boobs trying to get in there. Ugh. 
160,"I really feel this because in my office, the men are always 'fine' and our male boss keeps it super cold while all of the women have heaters and wear sweaters and complain about the cold. "
161,"Agree with this wholeheartedly, as someone who married on the younger side, never planned to get divorced at 28, if ever... But it happened. I think the single most important part of any marriage or relationship is _to know yourself fully_ before making a commitment to someone else.

I haven't remarried since-- but I'm in a committed relationship and we have a seven-month-old baby. I have interesting feelings regarding marriage now because I never want to go through a divorce again, not because it was a difficult process since we didn't have children or property together, but because I felt embarrassed about telling the world I found 'the one' only to have it all crumble. In fact, I told myself I'd never marry again because of that experience. 

My thoughts on that have shifted because I gave myself the time to figure out who I am for a year or two by myself before stepping into another relationship. My first marriage was centered around beliefs that I've now learned aren't true to my core. My best friend who is now a relationship counselor (I've known her since I was five, so she knows me VERY well) eased my feelings about everything by simply letting me know that a marriage can be within your own parameters. So instead of feeling like I lost myself trying to fit into an old school tradition of marriage, my partner and I can commit to each other and decide together what that looks like to us.

And to be honest, unlike the first time, I'd probably bawl like a baby if my partner proposed because I'm truly happy with myself, with him and what we have together."
162,"Or for shorties like me, they just cut into my neck 😠"
163,"I raged when my boyfriend was able to fit 3 full sized 5-6 inch phones HORIZONTALLY in one pocket of his jeans, while my phone has half of it sticking out normally.

Tbh, the pockets and phone problems also make women targets for theft, it's easier to swipe someone's phone if it's already halfway out

It's ridiculous

&amp;#x200B;"
164,Arguing with a dude who said women should always get a small separate bed to sleep in when they are on period because they cannot sleep in main bed with their husband or boyfriend. Life wtf.
165,"I hate my mother. 

Everyone thinks that “you should always love your mother no matter what.” 

Years of emotional abuse and manipulation, and I’m finally ready to admit that I hate her."
166,"If it's comfortable, go for it.

Visible pokies are socially acceptable these days, at least among women my age (ie, college students.)"
167,"This hurts and is something I struggle to internalize. I am a nice person: I help out when I can (and sometimes when I cannot), am always there to lend a sympathetic ear, and practice active listening when speaking with others. It's only natural to expect the same of others right? Well apparently not. I havent had an actual friend in the longest time, but have had one sided acquaintanceships where I'm pretty much a sounding board for their problems.

This happens to much I'm beginning to think that either I am the problem (I'm a bit weird) or the world is full of selfish assholes."
168,"I move to upvote this multiple times. 
SECONDED. 
Upheld."
169,"Seriously. The metaphorical glass ceiling is bad enough, guys! Don't add glass floors too."
170,Working with partners/friends to improve a relationship is worth it. Chasing and begging is not. There must be some form of effort on both sides.
171,Thrift stores are full of great stuff right now thanks to Marie Kondo.
172,"Geeky t-shirts. Sounds weird but they so often don't offer a curvy style. They just have a ""unisex"" option that's just a size down from the ""we sell to boxes with legs"" style. 

I'm not a rectangle! I want a cool geeky shirt that has inny-outty curvy bits!
"
173,"Hotel bathrooms. 

The lighting is always horrible. I travel almost constantly for work, and I have maybe been in two that weren’t obviously designed by men for men. Major complains include: dim lighting, the plug right next to the sink for electric shavers with not enough space for hot hair styling tools that need a little bit of counter space. "
174,"We just moved in together and I got these two tiny cacti that I think are really cute but he doesn't, so he keeps hiding them and I keep putting them back. I never notice when he's moved them until I find them in weird places. I started doing it too so now it's a constant game of 'hide or find the cacti'. I'm currently waiting for him to notice the one I put next to his craft beer.
"
175,"If the seats in the front of a vehicle aren't fully adjustable, I can't drive it.  I need it to be up-down adjustable, not just forward-backward, and that includes passenger seats as well.  We rented a car on our honeymoon that had seats so low that not only was it impossible for me to drive, I could barely see over the dash just sitting in the passenger seat.  I'm 5'1, I'm short but I'm not \*unusually\* short.  I ended up stealing a huge cushion from our Airbnb just so I could sit comfortably in the passenger seat, and fully removing the headrest."
176,"It definitely throws me a bit. I have a very “continental” nose...aquiline I guess? I definitely feel self conscious of it at times. I’m a bit self conscious of my eyelids because they’re more deep set.  

Overall though, I really do feel we’re moving away from the Kim K copycats and back towards celebrating “uniquely pretty” people. Kind of like in the 80s, I’ve noticed that women from that era could be non-conventionally pretty but still seen as beautiful.  

But the KKW copycat train has to end...I’m totally fine with plastic surgery, but soooo many girls are obviously attempting to look exactly like her.   

The pic Sephora posted of the Lily Lashes owner is a good example. It was *awful*. She is trying so hard to look like KKW but it doesn’t work. KKW looks good as KKW because she *is* her. "
177,Bigger ones tho
178,"The first time I ever got a dick pic (I was like 12....) my response to it was ""oh my god, what the fuck?! It looks like a deformed mushroom, is it okay??""

I'm still proud of 12 year old me. :) "
179,"Take actual care of your beard if you’re gonna let it grow. 

The amount of men I know that have a long beard because beards are now fashionable but don’t actually wash them or trim them properly is astounding. It’s not the length of the beard, it’s how you care for it. "
180,"Yep, same.  If I start to feel lonely I'll go to a coffee shop or mall and people watch and window shop.  I may still only interact with the cashiers but it seems to be enough for me."
181,"Every time I try to do this, it just makes me feel more lonely... I'm interacting with people but not connecting with anyone, and it just feels isolating."
182,"Well, the one and only time I had a guy sending me dick pics I got my dad to call him and threaten to call the cops if he didn't stop sending them to his 16 year old daughter. That worked

I was actually 16 at the time, some woman had given this guy my number at a bar and he wouldn't believe I wasn't her and just kept sending them. Keep in mind this what back when picture messaging was really expensive too. "
183,I fucking hate cheap tools painted pretty for women.  They are dangerous.
184,"I come across so many YouTubers (like Tana Tana Mongeau for example) and I'm always so shocked that they're only 2-4 years older than me, because they've gotten so much work done. "
185,There is such thing as over washing your face! Too much scrubbing can cause micro tears in your skin which can create more acne &amp; disrupt the healing process of old acne.

187,That's the exact article I had in mind!
188,"Yeah I’m on team always-bra. But I have big knockers and a small frame, so it’s *super* obvious when I’m not wearing one. I even wear one under my tank top when my in-laws stay over."
189,"That’s weird. We’re taught in nursing school that it’s good for laboring women to sit on a ball, walk around, and otherwise position themselves to facilitate the baby moving down via gravity and opening of the pelvis. However, once the patient is given pain meds, it’s a different story. We can’t have patients who’ve gotten epidurals or pain meds moving around as much, because of the increased risk for falls. "
190,Pretty much! Supposedly it's because women have more body variables but like... Isn't that why it should be researched more? They're still going to be taking the medication!
191,"Ted and Robin in How I Met Your Mother, and then Robin and Barney. In fact, with time and maturity I’ve come to realise in HIMYM in general was a misogynistic dumpster fire."
192,"Tattoos on a woman's body, or at least, many tattoos such that they cover a majority of one's body. Not necessarily Western society, but old-fashioned societies in which tattoos were related to criminals, syndicates, or manly men (see: sailors). However, despite being trendy in today's society, there are also a surprising amount of people who wrinkle their noses at me, and have made assumptions about my ""marrying abilities,"" future mothering skills, and femininity. My favorite is when they ask me what my tattoos are going to look like in the future. 

Answer: Saggy, like my butt. If it bothers you less, stare at that instead."
193,floss your teeth BEFORE you brush them 
194,"[A political party in Hong Kong](https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/lawmaker-warns-women-citys-worst-upskirting-spots/) has been publishing a list of these kinds of 'upskirting' spots for the past eight years.

195,"Curly hair,  I have beautiful (to me) curls and spend good money on specialized hair cuts, colour and hair treatments, so I flaunt them but I've lost count of the number of times I've been asked why don't I straighten my hair."

197,"Since there was no penis-vaginal penetration (he assaulted me in other ways) I have always had a hard time calling it rape, even though by definition what happened to me is legally considered rape. I’ve always felt that it somehow takes away the significance of the word for other survivors (yes I know this is so not true). I still call it a sexual assault, it’s what I’m most comfortable with, although I rarely talk about it "
198,Women also are less listened to when in pain and don’t have their pain adequately managed! https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/ great article that touches on MIs and how they aren’t adequately treated as well
199,Literally anything meant to keep warm. Sweaters? Either paper thin or thick but loosely knit so it does NOTHING. Hence why I prefer many male articles of clothing.
200,"Fieldwork PPE too! Rain gear, high-viz wear, cruising vests... Even the smallest sizes can fit way too big. Kind of a safety issue in dangerous environments.

And also just workwear in general for people who women who work on the more traditionally male trades or careers (construction, field research, forestry, fisheries, etc.) When I went into my local workwear store and asked for the women's section all there was were nursing scrubs.

201,"Yo though please keep in mind that coconut oil is very heavy and comodogenic for a lot of folks (ie pore clogging &amp; acne-causing). Your mileage may vary. I love oils for face and body and I usually use lightweight oils like argan, rose hip, seabuckthorn, grape seed, etc. The Ordinary has very reasonable prices for face oil."

205,block them and move on. Don't let yourself get drawn back. They want the fun parts of a relationship without the responsibility and they're hoping that you feel like this and give in.
206,My office card is designed like that and you're supposed to wear it in a way that it can be seen at all times. If you're wearing a longish shirt or anything that covers your pants a bit (blazers!!!) putting it on your pant pockets is not an option. This is why most women have resorted to awkwardly holding it in their hand
207,"Lots of women deliver on their knees or on all fours. The doctor doesn’t really NEED to be all up in there, unless of course there are complications. 

There are many women who argue that doctors have too much of a role in labor and delivery, not allowing the mother to be the one in control of the whole thing."
208,"If I'm not wearing a top with pockets, I put mine on my pants pocket. You could also clip it into the top of your skirt's/pants' waistband."
209,"Is your hisband....single?

210,"My favorite thing to do is take info from their dating profile and respond with something about that.

“Your profile says you’re a Christian. If you send that to your pastor and he says it’s okay for you to do that, I’ll go on a date with you.”

“Your profile says that your 6-year-old daughter is your entire world. How would you feel if someone sent that to her?”

“You realize you put your Instagram handle on your profile, right? What would (insert the handle from someone recently tagged in his pictures) think about this?”

And when there’s nothing interesting... “you realize this is a form of sexual harassment, right?”"
211,"Make sure you have ""me"" time. I know that everything feels like me-time when you're single and lonely, but if you start doing things that you enjoy, like taking yourself to a winery, or taking yourself to dinner, it helps some people build confidence in themselves."
212,"And even at stores for outdoor equipment, if you have big breasts and wide hips you then have to search in men's sizing... which end up too long in the arms! "
213,I kept mine. I couldn't think of a compelling enough reason to go through the administrative bother. 
214,LOL “yup. That’s basic human anatomy. You learned this in third grade y’all.” 
215,"This is the most annoying and harmful trope in movies. It's like every teen movie is about pining for a girl he can't have, and if he just does xyz she'll fall for him. And it eventually works! Except this sets a terrible precedent for guys to keep trying, because girls can be won over. This normalizes this creepy stalker behavior some guys develop, and it is not ok."
216,People can change. But only if they want to and put in the work to do so. Not if they say they will and keep doing the same thing. Listen to actions not just words
217,"I'm assuming by issue you mean a significant other having a problem with our closeness. 

My two close guy friends have always been respectful towards my partners and know where the line is in terms of appropriate behaviour. If they didn't we wouldn't be friends. 

As for my partners, I don't expect them to drop friendships for me and in turn I expect the same respect/courtesy."
218,When I discussed alternate birthing positions with my young female Dr. she said she didn't see any need for any of that. I was shocked at her negative  attitude on any of my thoughts opposite of just laying on my back hooked up to things for my daughters birth. 
219,"1. Sends me funny links, websites, tweets, etc. all day. No matter how annoyed we are with each other when we part in the mornings, we can always patch it up with a funny gif.

2. Makes my coffee in the mornings. Honestly, this may be self-preservation on his part, but I love him for it.

3. Never blinks when I bring home a new pile of fabric, yarn, plants or books. If it makes me happy, he loves it already. 

I'm not here to tell you our lives are perfect and bubblegum saccharine sweet. We have too much going on (3 kids and  17+ years of marriage) for that. But we're still hanging in there, so we're doing something right?"
220,"I'm like this and the people in our office just enjoy being around each other and we hang out a lot naturally for happy hours. Our company encourages us to get to know each other. We spend all day joking with each other and working, eating with, or helping each other, so it seems only natural to me that eventually you're gonna get friendly with people. I work with a lot of smart, funny people. :)

I have 2 tiers of office friends - those who I hang out with mostly during happy hours and other fun work related events, and those who I also hang out with in a more close friend setting, like going to yoga or brunch. I invite a lot of them to important things like my birthday party if it makes sense."
221,"Kinda related, but I get really annoyed now when there are two single toilet bathrooms, but they're still gendered. The only real difference (sometimes) is a urinal. Why even bother. "

226,"- A cup of tea at night, or in the morning, or even in your water bottle. Green tea (I like mine with peppermint!) is soooo good for you. 
- Lighting tiny tea lights (so cheap) and turning all the lights off. Listening to your favorite album, reading a book, or meditating. 
- Yoga — there are absolutely free community classes basically everywhere. But there’s also YouTube and r/yoga.
- Going to the park, or getting fresh air in any capacity. Getting that vitamin D! 
- Cooking yourself a nutritious, but delicious meal. Allowing yourself to make mistakes if you don’t know how to cook yet. 
- Taking a walk &amp; listening to your favorite music. 

I picked these things because they’re all wellness oriented with grounding techniques - or they’re things that help you be happy. There’s nothing more radiant than joy 💜

231,I go back and read from years ago. And I finally learned that time does dull a lot of things. Lost relationships that used to bring me to tears won’t anymore. I feel like it gives you perspective as to what the big feelings are that have stuck with you. And it tells you what was just situational small stuff. Also my memory is crap. I really don’t remember things I apparently experienced. 
232,I can't do it. I'm a 38 G and my boobs have no perk to them. I feel way too self-conscious to go out. Plus if it's warmer the boob sweat would be even more unbearable I think. I am definitely envious of the smaller chested women out there who can go braless and still look great in clothes.
233,ALSO. What to do with ‘sanitary items’ when I’m at a friend’s house and they don’t have a bin in the toilet... and I have to wrap it and take it to another bin.. usually in the kitchen... near all the other people... like... what?
234,"""Call your mother right now and apologize for being even more of a disappointment than your dick is"""
235,Own that shit! A *sexy* board with nipples.
236,There's no point in forgiving someone who has no respect for you. You should have the self-respect to be with someone who won't do horrible things to you.
237,"I've literally never even thought about removing my arm hair, which is really dark black against my tan skintone. A friend told me they shaved her arms and it actually shocked me. I just assumed other women were hairless or blond. "
238,"My Best Friend's Wedding didn't age well for most 2019 sensibilities. Cameron Diaz is a college junior who is dropping out to marry a 28 year old? Are we supposed to  want a ""cat fight"" over this mediocre man?"
239,I used to get on Omegle and sext with people when I was 14.
240,Every time I encounter a stall door without a hook I fantasize about putting one of those 3M sticky hooks up. I need to start carrying them in my purse!
241,"For what it's worth, India loves pale (or ""fair"") skin. They WORSHIP pale skin. To the point of racism/colorism. 

It's not good, obviously, and not that you need the reassurance, but it just goes to show how deeply ingrained perceptions vary drastically in different cultures."
242,"oh HELLO has someone said Default Health apps on most smart phones?? THE last four I've had don't have a period tracking option. Hello, why can't I track my heartrate and my period in the same phone?? why can't I use the same app that tracks EVERYTHING ELSE by default and add period stuff?????? it is one of the few things about my phone's design that infuriates me- it was so obviously created by a team of men who didn't bother to ask a single woman about what her needs might be. "
243,My large feet.  Lol
244,During summertime it’s pretty much my go to option because of the heat and sweat. I do however more often than not wear pasties to prevent pokies.
245,"No matter how much you love him, you need to have a life and identity outside of him"
246,"Being given permission to feel the way you feel about a situation is all you need to move forward and grow instead of wallowing in a continuous circle of sadness and self-loathing. Talk to someone outside of the situation. 

Asking for help doesn’t make you weak, it makes you stronger in the long run."
247,"I don’t follow you tubers and instagrammers, but in my area Botox is very popular for women starting in their mid twenties, even ten years ago when I started hearing from my peers that they weren’t looking forward to needing injections, as if that was a sure thing they *have* to do. Then again I lived in one of those Hollywood suburbs and the girls who said this were upper middle class, so there’s a certain expectation there. "
248,"If your skin is oily, try to moisturize your skin more and use oils. Your skin may be producing oil because it’s so dry. Grew up with terrible oily skin and it took me way to long to realize that. "
249,"I wish I'd known that uni wasn't my only option, I was absolutely not ready for that amount of freedom and the beginning of all of my real life issues. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure some of them would have surfaced eventually but that time in my life was a catalyst"
250,"Whenever I'm feeling kind of frumpy, I take a shower and then spend forever in the bathroom getting ready for bed. 
I wipe my face off with a damp washcloth- cold water if I just took a shower and warm if I didnt.
Then I put lotion on and use vaseline on my lips. 
Then I brush my hair and spend a while braiding it. If I take a shower I wrap my hair up in a tshirt instead of a towel to let it dry a bit before braiding it.

This is all very generic stuff, but I do it very carefully and concisely. It makes me feel like I'm glowing afterwards, and I wake up feeling prettier. I so find that spending just a couple more seconds shampooing, brushing my teeth, or whatever, it's a much more effective routine.

I find that if I rush or if I dont spend this time to focus on making my basic routine more enjoyable and worthwhile then I just start feeling gross or ugly during the day.

So in a nutshell, my advice is to spend more time on the things you are already doing. You dont have to buy fancy products, or invest in some medical procedure. Just take more time for yourself at night (or in the morning), and that might help. 

It certainly helped me, it has definite helped my skin clear up and my hair is cleaner for longer. And I feel better most days."
251,"God knows that I tried so much, but they're not very interested -\_-"
252,"Same. Unless I’m wearing a really flowy shirt that would literally expose my boobs if I wasn’t wearing a bra, then I don’t. It’s way more comfortable for me since I don’t really need any support from bras."
253,"Hard hats and safety vests. I work in an office but sometimes have meetings on construction sites where I am required to wear hard hats and safety boots and vests. The hard hats don’t fit me at all. I have to leave my hair down which then proceeds to get covered in concrete and whatever other particles of materials are in the air (including aluminum shavings). If I put my hair up like I want to the hard hat doesn’t fit. 

Safety vests suck too. It’s more like a safety dress. "
254,Not sure if this counts since a movie adaptation of a book but Edward and Bella in Twilight
255,Don’t expect a BJ unless your D is fresh and clean. 
256,"A guy that I had never talked to before dm’d me a dick pic on Insta. 
Me: “That was brave.”
Him: “So you like it?”
Me: “I’m honestly indifferent. Nothing about a stranger’s unsolicited erection does it for me. You may want to strike up a conversation and feel a vibe before putting yourself out there in the future. The next person may not be as patient or kind.”"
257,"I mean, just pretty much any safety equipment or tools. Also, the giant ass inconvenient size of phones, ya know, since guys tend to have larger hands, so it's not a problem for them. Apparently speech recognition is also more likely to understand when men say something than women. There's also the thing in real life that I've faced of barely being able to reach the rail on the bus to steady myself while guys can pmuch just grab it comfortably."
258,"The lockers in the *women*'s locker room at my gym. All lockers are half lockers. The top row is so high up, I (5'5"" so not even short for a woman) have to stand on tip toes to reach the lock, and there's no way I can ever reach the hook on top. No one uses them. They could all just be full-length lockers instead. Also, we have enough counters/sinks/blowdriers for 15 women (compared to maybe 6 in the men's), but only three small benches to sit on or put bags on. The designers must honestly believe we spend 2 minutes changing and 55 minutes doing makeup.  "
259,Even though heart disease is one of the leading killers of women in the U.S.
260,"Whether or not I am Turkish. I am not, and as far as I know, nor is anyone in my family. Didn’t stop a complete stranger arguing with me about it though. Very odd."
261,"""Oohh, yeees, but not as smalls as yours!"" 🤣"
262,"In my culture it’s common for unmarried adults to live with parents, making age appropriate contributions to the household, and I don’t believe there’s a “too old.” There’s only a “too old” for being taken care of like a child. "
263,"Sleep! So important.

When I lived in an area with very hard water (i.e. mineral-rich), I had to use a dilute vinegar rinse every time I washed my hair or else it would be dull, ratty, and tangly. I just kept a bottle of cheap white vinegar in the shower and had an old yogurt tub to dilute it in...😅 You could definitely come up with a more elegant solution!"
264,"I didn't even know that I had anything ""wrong"" with my body until I saw an increasing number of people/ads on social media recommending ways to get rid of them. 

I never once noticed them or had any problem with them at all. 

Of course, now I notice them and I can see why some might find them unappealing. I don't care enough about them to try and ""fix"" it anyways. 

"
265,I wish you could put the pedals closer so I'm not sat 3 inches from an airbag that will most definitely kill me if it releases in an accident...
266,What's your workplace like? How does this dynamic happen?
267,So so so many cuddles
268,"If my chair is high enough to comfortably reach my desk, my feet can't touch the floor."
269,"When you’re pushing your baby out, push like your pooping. No one just said it plain like that and I was struggling for awhile before I accidentally pushed like I had to shit and everyone got so excited “YES! Like that!”  DUDE! Why didn’t you just say that! All this “bearing down” shit. Just say it-POOP! Ugh. We’re all trying to be “proper” and not wanting to offend anyone. I struggled so much more than I had to."
270,"“WTF why would you send me that?!”

Now say that again, but slowly "
271,"I don't think it would be harmful if you categorized yourself with them - it would show that rape victims aren't always complete shadows of their former selves, the problem of rape is so insidious that it very well could have happened to the well-recovered and adjusted woman next to you. Kind of like you had been in a terrible road accident that would leave a lot of people crippled but you walked away. By clearly categorizing yourself as a victim/survivor you can also be one more voice that the roads can be crazy dangerous and should be made safer."

273,"And on the other side of that coin, the ""bad boy"" who falls for the ""good girl,"" and she patiently teaches him how to be the perfect man, which he does! Thus teaching us that if we are only patient and loving enough, eventually that devilish man will see that we deserve for him to become his best self."
274,"Can we just talk about speculums. . .

275,The world will not treat you any better just because you're a good person with a good heart.
276,I never realised how common they are.  Not just on women but men as well. 
277,"""Teener peener lmaooooo"" usually annoys the fuck out of them."
278,He turned out to be a total tool and a horrible partner. A bunch of time wasted on that. 
279,"It must be hard to argue with you braless, when you already make two outstanding points."
280,"Me too.  I’ve actually considered breast reduction.  My cousin had breast cancer and she had both her breasts removed and “designer” ones (her words) put on.  She picked small breasts and she couldn’t be happier (and cancer free!!!). Her surgeon tried to talk her into breasts the same size as her old ones, but she wanted to be able to go bra-less and wear cute backless tops and really celebrate her new found health and outlook on life.  She caught her cancer early and battled it aggressively and won, and she deserves her cute boobs! "
281,So....hips?? I just looked it up and still don't know what that is. 
282,"Cleaning without being asked. Co-parenting our dogs. Making me dinner before I get home from work. Always being around when I need a kiss/hug/butt touch. Being respectful and encouraging of my habits/space/hobbies. 

I moved in in October and it's been wonderful. I've lived with two SOs previously, and had numerous roommates in my life. But this has been the best living situation by far aside from living by myself. It might even be better than that, because when I have bad anxiety weeks he at least does the dishes and cleans the house which I wouldn't have the drive to do on my own. "
283,"I read somewhere that they respond with, “omg is that a child’s penis?! I’m reporting you, you sick fuck.” "
284,"Oooof. May I ask, what was ‘the moment’ you first started realising / learning this?"
285,"My long labia.

Apparently it's supposed to mean I ride the *cock carosel* but I've had these awesome flaps all my life and I've never thought I should care about what they look like. They just are what they are."
286,"That if I could meet myself 10 years ago, I would be so excited to tell him who they get to marry. I'd never tell my wife though because that's cornball as shit."
287,"when i was a teen my mum would joke that the size of one of my thighs was the size of what my waistline should be.

i've got a whole heap of insecurities on my weight, but i've always been weirdly proud of my big thighs... i got lightning bolts tattooed on them now too, so they're officially thunderthighs :)"
288,*yep*. there's a big flight of open stairs to my workplace and i find myself scuttling like a beetle when i go up because I don't want the world to see my butt any more than it has to
289,They need to offer lanyards as an option as standard
290,"My nose is small and thin, I always thought it was cute. I broke it when I was little so it has a bump. 

My aunt was married to a renowned plastic surgeon and when I was 14 he told me he was going to fix my face when I was 18. I was like “what are you talking about?” 

“Your nose. I’m going to fix that monstrosity.  Also going to fix your lips. Your cheekbones are ok thought “ 

I had NEVER been self conscious before that! And since then I began to hate how i looked in photos 

I’m 41 now, said uncle is no longer married to my aunt and I’m very happy with my crooked nose thank you very much. He can keep his cocaine snorting nose out of all our lives for the remainder of times "
291,"It's not for me. I'm not against marriage, I just don't see the point in it.

Yes, there are legality issues that marriage comes with, but nothing that can be worked around. 

There are wills, power of attorneys, and other legal documents that can be arranged with a lawyer. 

I find the ceremony to be beautiful sometimes. But you can always have a ""ceremony"" to celebrate the commitment two people have.

I was kind of a loser in high school,  and I accepted that I would be alone forever. 

I have a boyfriend who isn't against marriage, just isn't in a rush to go down the altar. We have been together 6 years, and while we love each other and we have built our lives together. We both don't feel like getting married is going to improve on anything. "
292,"Let me add on the mature addendum to that.  ""If someone tries to leave, talk things over and see if you can resolve differences.  If they still want to leave, let them.""  

It takes two willing parties to make a relationship.  At any time for any reason either party can decide to end it."
293,"I've had this exact issue. My husband thought I'd be able to walk into a Wal-Mart and buy work gloves in my size. I tried not to laugh, really I did. 

He's also been surprised that they don't have women's thermal socks, packs of cheap shirts, and warm boots that aren't fur lined. "
294,"exactly haha it's hips, yet social media seems to think that the natural shape of a womans hip is incorrect and needs to be fixed. "
295,"They should offer hats, which sit on the seat and below for you to urinate in, then pour into the cup. "
296,"If someone says they dont want to have kids or get married, believe them the first time. They will not grow out of it and you will waste years of your life waiting."
297,Respect in the workplace. 
298,"This is so true. I used to wear heels quite a bit and just dealt with it. Then I broke my foot one day (I was bare foot, not heels related!) and after hobbling along on crutches and in a walking cast, I got so sick of not being able to move properly and be free, or walk a proper speed. I realized how limiting heels are, how we have to walk so much slower or it can be quite taxing, how difficult it actually can be to walk properly when surfaces change, slippery, grates, stairs, loose gravel on a side walk ... now I'm like fuck it and just wear flats. I can also run to catch a train or easily cross the street now. So much freer and I don't give a damn if I look less dressy. My feet need to carry me through life and dammit I'm going to treat them better so that they can.

299,"No such thing as too old to live at home - disabled folk may need to live at home, people go through unexpected problems in their life so may need to move back home, the economy sucks so a lot of people have no choice but to stay at home or move back while they save for a home. "

302,"I'll get into a phase of enjoying painting my nails as a restful, fun activity and then a phase of being annoyed because it chips and leaving the polish off for months."
303,"A good way to to keep this going (and an overall good thing for both of you to get in the habit of) is expressing appreciation to your spouse when they do something thoughtful or kind. It can be as small as saying thank you when they’ve emptied the dishwasher without being asked. It fosters good feelings all around, and people will continue to do more if they know it’s appreciated. "
304,"When I learned CPR we had to practice finding the right spot on each other, men and women. Slightly awkward but I mean you've got to get over it if you ever need to do CPR on a woman, so it's probably best to figure out in a less stressful situation anyway. "
305,"The majority of public restrooms were obviously designed, or at least detailed, by men. Some examples: do NOT put the waste bin outside of the stall! Or in the case of standalone restrooms-- where they put them all the way across the fucking room! We need to dispose of sanitary items that are best dumped in a bin (with a lid!) within arms reach of the toilet. Same goes for bad location of toilet paper rolls-- I ain't tryna go-go gadget just to get some two ply. Sensored paper towel roll dispensers located next to a toilet, that we ladiez have to sit on, triggering endless dispenses of paper towels while you just tryna do your business. No hooks to hang purses,nursing/changing bags, or coats. Sure! Let me hold all my things on my lap while I wipe my cooch? Restrooms without mirrors (bad design for all genders imo). Restrooms without proper changing tables for infants. Bad lighting. Terrible circulation i.e. door opening inward while there's a line of people who are waiting to wash their hands but there's a hold-up because there is only one mirror and someone needs to adjust their make-up, and the trash bin to throw away your used paper towels is back behind the other people waiting so you are all shuffling around and there's a jam and nobody can go in either direction. :end rant: 

TL;DR For the love of God, hire a female to design your public restroom!"

310,"A woman wearing men's clothing is ""gender neutral"" or ""androgynous"" while a man wearing women's clothing is ""deviant."" It's infuriating. "
311,"My husband and I got dollar shave club, and I’m never going back. I’ve never used a sharper blade, they send them to me and I don’t have to think about it, and there’s no pink tax."
312,"Let me save you SOOOOOO much time and tears, dear friend - if it was worth it, \*both\* people would be fighting for the relationship. A ""relationship"" where one person is fighting to save it = inherently not worth it."
313,"Medicines. Male is default, women are a much less-researched subset. Pregnant women basically don't exist. "
314,You’re right but what happens if the person that doesn’t want to relationship keep contacting the person that does and wanting to spend time with them and be with him in every way possible but doesn’t want to be in a relationship and that other person is trying to MoveOn and keeps getting drawn back it’s hurtful
315,YES. I want something that doesn’t require large straps and a 3 hook closure too!
316,"Delivering on your back, the one you see in any popular depiction of childbirth. Just think about it: it narrows the pelvic opening by putting pressure on the tailbone, puts unnecessary stress on the perineum (which can lead to tearing). You're sort of delivering ""uphill,"" against gravity. 

Better positions are basically...anything else. Delivering on your side, or on all fours, or squatting.

But, the supine position is easier for doctors... sooo... here we are."
317,Mario?
318,I was thinking about this recently as I'm taking part in a few scientific trials. The amount that exclude anyone on hormonal birth control is astounding. I totally understand they don't want to risk any other variables that could contribute to their results but it blew my mind thinking of all this migraine/cancer/eating disorder research (those just being ones I've taken part in) that exclude a HUGE number of women under 30/35 because of birth control
319,"My brown skin. For living in a country where white, ""gluta"" skin is worshipped, I could care less about conforming to that beauty standard. I love being brown."
320,Sometimes you arent prepared to take the hard way. And that is okay. The easy way exists.
321,"When I worked at a grocery store near 2011, I actually remember someone came in without a bra and everyone was staring at her chest. I felt so upset for her. It was a lot more uncommon then, but I just don't get the point of staring."
322,"When I was younger and stupid and had no self esteem, I tried. He still cheated on me. For four years.

327,"I didn't have trouble calling it rape, but I did have a lot of trouble feeling sad about it. I was just violated and *angry*.


So I learned to fight.


I do have nightmares sometimes, and I will fight someone if they grab me by the wrist or touch me when I can't see them, but overall, I'm fine. 


I don't know any women in my social circles who *haven't* been raped, so it's not like my story or experience or trauma is special in any way. I'm glad I'm at least tough enough and mean enough to deal with it. A lot of women aren't. "

I feel fortunate that I met my husband and for us, it’s been a great decade. And many more to come."

331,"&gt; Most importantly, a building should accommodate the people who use it, not the other way around.

332,"Somewhere around my mid-30s, I ran out of fucks to give and I haven't replenished the supply since then so... :: shrug ::"
333,I stopped dating guys who had an issue with me having guy best friends. If a guy can't/won't give me the benefit of the doubt in the beginning then there isn't a path to something more which requires full trust.
334,Same boat here. I also find that I prefer to wear one anyways for support reasons unless I'm essentially not moving. The bounce is not fun if you have to jog a few steps or run up some stairs.
335,I got this to happen in my office. There are 5 ladies and 7 men that sit on our floor. 3 of the men run cold. The ladies of the floor once blew the breaker 4x in one day so they took away our space heaters. I started a campaign to raise the thermostat. The clencher was when safety  deemed it unacceptable that 3 people's fingers were turning blue from the cold. They changed the temp from 61F to 68F. It is soooooo much better now!
336,"They’re my closest friends. We didn’t start off this way but over the years various internal moves at work brought us all together and we’ve worked together now for 11 years as a core group (but a few of us have worked together longer) and each year our friendship has grown. It’s not been perfect and there was drama in the early years but now we’ve all settled in and we’re really good, really close friends. We have a work chat group that’s very active 24/7 so we don’t ever go a day without talking to each other, even when on vacation or off sick etc. They’re the first ones to offer support or sing praises. They’ve been more supportive towards me through difficult times than my own family or friends I’ve known way longer. I’d be lost without them.

Whenever we’ve had temps help us out they’ve always commented on the friendship and said how rare and lovely it is working in a team like ours. They make an otherwise unexciting job a pleasure to go to."

338,Seatbelts are a big one actually. Women a have a higher injury rate in crashes because they are designed and optimized for an average male height
339,"Boobs, most of the time I have no problem with my flat chest. But I have seen so many ""clothes for real women"" or other ""real women"" (with ass and boobs) stuff. What am I then if not a woman? A cucumber?"
340,Yes! My lab coat is too small to fit over my hips sitting down so I can't even button the bottom and our one pair of liquid nitrogen gloves are size  large.... I wear extra small glove size normally.
341,"The same happened to me. It started consensual, and then I started saying no and he didn't listen. Also wouldn't let me leave his house, had to basically break out and run away. 

I still consider it rape. I reported it as rape, even though when I reported it I remember saying ""I don't know if this counts"" but the wonderful woman who took my report said that of course it counts, and made me feel so comfortable and safe.

It affects me sometimes. Like if someone does or says something that reminds me of that night or of him. One time I saw him while I was on the bus and it passed by the store he works for and I shut down.

I honestly think the only reason it doesn't affect me THAT much anymore, or even right after the event, is because I went through horrible trauma when I was a teenager, so in my mind I just was like, if I could survive that then I can survive this. And from then on I would just avoid men that reminded me of him. If I'm with someone or dating someone that reminds me of him, I consider it a red flag and distance myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps"

345,"""Oh it's so romantic that Snape never stopped loving Lily."" No. No it isn't. It's creepy AF. She was nice to him for about 10 minutes when they were children and 20 years later he's so obsessed over her that he's a jerk to her child because Harry reminds him that she chose someone else over his racist ass. Plus the whole ""you can murder James and the baby IDGAF but make sure you let Lily live so I can take another crack at her"" thing when he was a death eater. It's gross and creepy and awful. I mean yeah James wasn't exactly king of the awesomes when he was a kid, but he obviously got over the whole I'm Super Cool Guy thing. Shit he's the only one that really grew among the gang - Snape and Sirius were the same folks they were in high school. And that's fucking sad"
346,"A guy asked me to visit him, sent me pictures, asked me for pictures, and talked to me every day for a little over a week about how much he liked me...then he just disappeared. Won't answer messages, doesn't talk to me, and the few times I've hung out with him since he seemed completely uninterested. I'm not great with people, and have a lot of trouble even making friends, so it's kinda fucked up my sense of self worth/confidence to know how easily someone can just drop me like that. "

That's exactly why the (mostly male) obstetricians started saying that was best practice, when obstetrics started becoming an actual medical specialty."
348,"That couple from the notebook. I watched it with friends who adored it when I was 14. Over the years I realised just how sexist and harmful it was because the movie was basically saying that it's ok for a woman to hit, scream and punch a man for breaking up with her who isn't even fighting back."

350,"In this same vein though, if you’re not sure, take some time off if you need to. I’ve seen a few people pick a major they end up hating before dropping out altogether, and never going back. Or starting and stopping several programs before finally finding one they like or are ok with. 

I decided on a gap year after high school for several reasons but it turned into 12 years *somehow*. Now I’m 31 and in my freshman year of college, while also raising a family-the kids are all in school, so I am too now. I don’t recommend this particular route but I know what I want to do with my life, I know how to get there and I’m motivated to do well. 18 year old me wouldn’t have done as well as I am now."
351,"This is true for autism as well - a lot of autistic women aren't diagnosed well into adulthood, myself included. We're often initially misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder."
352,"These are all great tips! 


Remember that cost does not necessarily equate to quality. 

Coconut oil works wonders for my skin and hair! I put it on my face, in my hair, on my legs, my hands, lips, everything. It’s like $10 for a jar and lasts sooo long. 

I do spend money on organic or all natural hand soaps, though. (Like Ms. Meyers.) A lot of stuff just dries me out like crazy. 

As for a nail care kit... I bought a cheap UV light off of Amazon for $15, crystal nail file, and 6 different gel polishes in addition to the top and bottom coat. I had the polished shipped from China, so it was super super super cheap. Doing my nails makes me feel so beautiful and well put together. What a great suggestion!"
353,"A read quite often of this ""love language"". Is it actually insightful? How does one find what is theirs?

I'm curious because i never heard or read of that outside reddit! "
354,"Knowledge is not a shortcut for experience. I’m a tad of a control freak so I like to read ahead and inform myself on things but I’ve found that knowing something is happening to me or around me, why it’s happening, what the best course of action is, etc. intellectually just doesn’t stop me from having to steer myself through the feelings, the situation, the sensations... In essence, knowing something is very different from actually experiencing it."
355,"So my boyfriend's ex girlfriend, right.. She took the breakup very hard (they dated for 5 months). When we got together 6 months later, it sent her into a whirlwind of emotional turmoil. She tried to be everywhere he was by stalking through social media and at one point tried to convince a friend of ours who was watching his dog that he said she could have her for a day (she believes they adopted the dog ""together""... honey no, it was his dog), would use his family to get closer to him, beg for phone calls for closure, etc. So he felt it was best to go no contact with her and avoid the outings with their mutual friends where she was there.

Fast forward to now, a year and a half later. It's been long enough that we're kind of over it and aren't going out of our way to avoid her anymore. She's been making more and more appearances at social gatherings and although she's for the most part pleasant and we get along, every so often she gets.. a little too drunk and has a weird breakdown, overshares about how much she's cried over us in the past, and clings onto me really hard as though we're best friends. It's a little weird, but it's... it's fine. This is fine.

The real wake up call was the other night. Everything started out fine. We were like, wow Erica is really on her best behavior today! And then when we left a BBQ at a mutual friend's house, she coincidentally left at the same time because ""her cab was downstairs."" There was no cab. She walked home with us (sure, she lives in the same direction.. this is normal right?).

And before we parted ways she begged us to let her come up to our apartment to see the dog. Girl this ain't healthy tho."
356,I’m a normal sized woman who struggles to find pants that fit. Skirts/dresses are comfortable af.

358,"""You should probably get that checked out by a doctor. It doesn't look normal..."""
359,"Similar to ""hangs out with me in the shower.""

One of my favorite things that my fiance does is to sit with me when I'm getting ready for a big event in the bathroom. It gets lonely, that hour spent on hair and makeup! So he always comes in and just talks to me. 

Legitimately some of our best conversations have happened with him on the toilet and me with a curling iron in my hand lol"
360,"Ugh yes! I had a project where I had to point this out to multiple men multiple times. 
“Why would they be wearing dresses?” Oh, I don’t know, because it’s the VIP Event room of an upscale winery? 
“Who would even see?” 
It literally cantilevers over the production space. Anyone working will see. 
On the flip side, I did have to have a guy point out that I shouldn’t have urinals and lavatories on opposite walls because then you just see dudes peeing in the mirror. "
361,How about this dude gets the small bed. It doesn’t have to be separate though as no one should have the misfortune of marrying that asshat.

Then the writers decided to assassinate both of their characters, and everything just turned weird and abusive-y. The fact that this pairing remains an ~OTP~ for many people just... doesn't bewilder me, exactly, but kind of makes me sad."
370,"I totally get this. If I’m going to be alone and lonely, I’d prefer it to be in the comforts on my cozy house. Being out in a coffee shop or a park mostly worsens my mood as there’s so many people having a great time together and it just reminds me of what I’m missing out on. 

Plus my cat is at home 🐈"
371,The countertop too! If the countertop were several inches lower I could get proper leverage for cutting things and have an easier time using large mixing bowls.
372,"How to pronounce my name. I said, it (proper pronunciation) then they said, “you mean (different pronunciation)”. I laughed it off, restating what the proper pronunciation, but they didn’t find it funny at all, and proceeded to call me by the incorrect name during the rest of our interaction."
373,"You're not the dumbest person in the room.

This is something that I'm still learning."
374,I had a former 'friend' refuse to try to date one of my guy friends despite her obvious crush on him because I 'had dibs' on him which was so patently ridiculous.  Gotta love it when people make their social ineptitude your fault somehow.
375,I needed this 20 years ago so badly
376,At some point turning the thermostat up makes sense. 
377,That scene where he’s dangles off the Ferris wheel unless she says yes to a date. They REALLY tried teaching us that that’s “romantic”. I can’t.
378,The Gillette Mach3 (and Target knock-off) heads fit on the Venus handle. Better blade but still get to keep the non slippery handle. If you want more blades the other ones may work as they seem to try to use the same connection to minimize that part of the design/production process.

381,Hope I get there soon. I hate that it shows every bruise/sunburn/imperfection. I’m constantly wanting to tan my skin (even though I can’t bc I burn). 
382,"I feel sorta similar but the reason I’m not even letting it affect me that much is because I feel I let it happen. I probably could have said stop and then left.

But lately I’ve realized I’m a people pleaser and I’ve learned that I’m used to people crossing my boundaries. When people cross my boundaries physically I completely disassociate. I zone out and let things happen to me. 

I never told the person who violated me that I wanted to do anything with him. I also expressed I’m asexual and sex disinterested. As soon as I went to his place, he started kissing me. I shut down. I didn’t want to do anything but it’s so ingrained in me to be passive and disassociate to cope.

I definitely blame myself for not saying no or leaving. I blame myself for going to his place. 

On top of this, my last relationship was so traumatizing I’ve realized I don’t know how to pick out good people and it makes me want to retreat. I don’t trust myself. And I don’t trust the “bad” people to not take advantage of me."
383,Geez even our clothes are designed with men in mind!
384,"Yes, because I was underage and did not consent (in fact gave clear signals of not consenting) BUT he was also underage and I keep wondering if maybe he somehow missed what I was doing/saying to get him to stop.  "
385,Very wise response.
386,"My wife was super sad when she started getting them during her pregnancy.  But when she brought it up to her friend, nearly all of them said they had them too.  It made her feel a lot better knowing they were far more common than she previously thought.  Basically we learned, if your body has ever developed quickly, gain weight or been pregnant, you have stretch marks."
387,Clean your bathroom. I can assure you there is piss on the floor somewhere.
388,Props to him and his wife!
389,Women’s heart attack referred pain is “atypical” and often missed because it doesn’t present like a classic heart attack. You! don’t! mean! Classic! You mean male. Just say it

391,Documenting code is important.
392,I'd probably leave it in the pocket of my bag. I don't understand why people don't have bins in the one place you really need them though...
393,"Same. If I had walked away from my husband the first time he said “I met someone else and I want a divorce” I could have saved myself SO much strife and hardship. Instead I spent a year trying to make him love me again. 

He didn’t."

396,“Purveyor of dicks” is an incredible phrase.
397,"I personally believe social media has definitely normalized plastic surgery, more specifically nose jobs. I feel like every week I see a viral tweet about needing a nose job to be happy. I’m a very young teen, so of course I’m pretty influenced by what I see on social media (it’s hard not to be, I’m exposed to it 24/7). I feel like in the past year, everyoooone is after a perfect dainty nose like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/c3/1b/c2c31b3523360de3c8617473d04c1289.jpg). I’ve never really been insecure of my nose, (it’s kinda big and doesn’t have a fairy-ish tip like the dainty nose), but seeing everyone on social media praise small noses started making me feel super insecure. There was even a couple months where I begged my mom for nose surgery and I absolutely hated my nose, and tried everything to make it look smaller. Now, I’m definitely not saying you’re not allowed to be insecure about your features, but I feel like it’s affecting teens, such as myself, and young adults. If you search up “nose job” on Twitter, every tweet is about how OP is going to be unstoppable once they get a nose job, or “her nose job really helped her”, etc. please don’t take this as negativity towards plastic surgery, I am all for it!"

402,"You are so brave! I aspire to be like this haha but I'm just way too shy, I hate knowing that people are looking at me, especially that area! I can't believe he said that, super inappropriate haha but you handled it so well. I probably would have run out crying, no joke."
403,"Thanks for this advice! I’ll keep it in mind when I am shitting my kid out in 4 months. 

And I mean that in the nicest way possible."
404,There was a study at my university (some like 8-10 years ago) that was looking at the lack of range of motion and ability to breathe for large chest women in military gear. I hooked up to a motion tracking device and did a bunch of stuff with and without the vest on. The results were a staggering negative in that I could barely sit up when without I did like 30 sit ups no problem. And any time I wasn't leaning forward were taken with only half breaths. 
405,"I was interested in a friend at university. He would accompany me on little errands and seemed to reciprocate my flirting. I asked him on a date, he said he wasn't interested in dating me. I told him I found him attractive and would be very interested in a FWB arrangement. He said he wasn't interested in sexual activities outside the context of a serious relationship.

We actually did wind up dating for several years, though he didn't ask me out until many months later when I was starting to meet others to try to get over him. I think he was shy and concerned I wasn't serious about him."
406,Yes! When I was growing up I was so for Ross and Rachel but rewatching as an adult they never had a good relationship.
407,"Dude, I switched to an old-timey mens safety razor and while I do have to be more careful when using it, I love it so much! It's easier to nick yourself with it but replacement blades are super cheap and once you get the swing of it, it just gives a great shave. The only problem I have with it is when I use it on fine hair, but it still works pretty darn well "
408,"Wash yo hands before you touch the pussy, please"
409,"I blocked it out for quite some time.  I woke up to it happening and I froze.  I didn’t do anything to stop it.  It feels like I complied because I didn’t try to stop it and no words left my mouth.  I still blame myself.  It’s something buried in the back of mind, well mostly, it makes an appearance now and again to give me a shame attack.  "
410,A weighted blanket does amazing things for the physical loneliness
411,"I wish I had small boobs! Big boobs are overrated and honestly just a hassle to deal with. I've alway wondered how these women who get implants cope with them on a day to day basis. If my boobs were that firm and upright all the time, I think I'd go insane."
412,"Came here to say PPE. Everything is too big and designed for a male torso. My FRs gap absurdly around my waist. 

And there is exactly one style of steel toed boots with metatarsal plates that goes small enough to fit my feet. I wear a women's 7, so it's not like they're freakishly small.

There are studies out there that go into how women are more at risk because of poor-fitting ppe."

423,"***Hoookay***. Buckle up.  
  
I went to a sushi restaurant with friends that has karaoke on Thursdays. This gorgeous guy got up and belted out a stunning rendition of Mack the Knife and I was smitten. I wrote my number on a napkin and told the waitress to give it to him after we left.  The next day, I got a text. We chatted a little and he invited me back out to that same restaurant with his friends. Evidently he's a regular there.  
  
I showed up and we had a great night. Chemistry was through the roof. Even his friends pulled me aside and were like, *we've never seen him like this!* We all ended up wandering to a 24/7 coffee shop after the sushi place closed and were there until nearly sunrise.  Finally, he invited me back to his place.   
  
He went upstairs and came back down with some clothes for me to sleep in...and also a blanket and pillow. For the *couch.*  He then informed me he ***and his girlfriend*** (currently asleep upstairs) had somewhere to be in the morning, but I was welcome to stay the night and let myself out whenever. He cheerfully bid me goodnight and went upstairs. I stood there, *very* confused. A quick lookaround of the condo revealed many nicely-framed pictures of the guy and some smiling young lady.   
  
I waited about 45 minutes and quietly left. Never went back to that sushi place or heard from him again. "
424,Lawnmower! The handle is just a smidge too high. It needs to be about 4 inches lower for me to feel like I have optimal control of the machine.
425,"Yeah, same. I feel like I look better for myself when I have a bra on and my clothes sit in the right spots on me. It makes me look slimmer and better proportioned than going braless ever will. Now if I'm at home or with my closest group of friends/family, I don't care to go without a bra just for home comfort."

428,"As a 32B I have to say I've never felt like I look great in clothes braless either. My boobs are perky but in a pointy way--I have puffy nipples so they basically look like the ""brand new"" boobs of a newly-pubescent preteen. Being braless makes me feel too exposed. I don't know who these magical women are who have perfectly sized, perfectly shaped breasts without a bra, but I also wish I could pull it off."

Between the agonies of underwire, the ridiculousness that is bra straps, the complete lack of a standard sizing chart across companies, the wildly different styles and types of bras that fit women vastly differently, the fact that anything above a ""D"" (which is not actually that big) is going to cost you $50+, the social stigma of bra shopping, and the *obscenely* undertrained and mistrained ""professional bra fitters""....they are not actually designed for the women who are supposed to be wearing them."
