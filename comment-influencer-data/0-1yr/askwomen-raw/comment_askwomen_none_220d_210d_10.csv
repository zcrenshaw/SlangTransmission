0,"I started indoor climbing at a gym last month and I'm not good at it yet but I'm not giving up and I get better every time I go! For a long time I've thought of myself as a fundamentally lazy person since I often give up on things too quickly or don't even try things that seem hard, but I'm beginning to think that being lazy isn't an ingrained character flaw so much as a habit that I can change. "
1,"Yay, English. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese here. Being a polyglot is AMAZING!"
2,"My new years resolution was to get a new job that is not in Customer Service/public facing. 

I start a new job on Monday that pays 5k more a year, is closer to home, and it's not in a call center! 

It's also the first time I negotiated my pay and asked for more money than they offered, and they accepted! 

I'm really excited and proud of myself, especially because I was miserable in my old job but I had just moved to a new state so I had to take what I could get at first."
3,"My baby turns one this month. That will be one year of EBF (exclusive breastfeeding). It has been damn hard and we‚Äôve had more challenges than I can count. We freaking did it and it is my proudest accomplishment of my life. 

The food she eats is all homemade and healthy. She doesn‚Äôt eat ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù all the time, but my husband and I have struggled with weight our whole lives. We want our child(ren) to have healthy starts and good habits. "

6,You just need to work out/eat the way I do/be happy -- without any recognition that none of those things was actually an option from where I stood at the time.

I have panic disorder."

11,"Sleep through the night!! Yay, he can now breastfeed our baby! Honestly that would be so nice. 
"
12,"I am also on the spectrum and I am a functioning woman with a job, education, hobbies, relationships. I didn‚Äôt find out until I was an adult and most people wouldn‚Äôt notice I was on the spectrum until I brought it up. I just have slightly different mannerisms, behaviors and patterns of thinking. I still have a normal life. I‚Äôd love to see more of that. "
13,Did my first deadlift ever last night. :)
14,"My anxiety has been very, very bad lately but I've managed to not break. I still crack jokes with friends, have a great relationship, and have been taking care of myself more."
15,Well congratulations on this new journey! I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through feeling that way because of other people in the past. 
16,"I've started IF and cut way down on sugar. I have already lost a few pounds and I'm very proud of myself for sticking with it. I can't tell anybody though because I'll get lectured about anorexia. (I'm not anorexic, i eat 1200 calories a day, which my doc says is a healthy amount for weight loss.)"
17,"I lost 30 lbs! Yay me! I've only got 15 more to go, yay! I'm so happy, but people don't like hearing about weight loss success so I don't get to say it often. "

19,"My husband . When I got pregnant he went into super daddy driven mode and took us from living in a crap apartment, to owning our own house. It took us a year and a half, but we are now home owners of a beautiful house. I don‚Äôt talk about it often with my friends, when we first bought our house, our friends all were going through some rough things and I just didn‚Äôt want them to feel like I‚Äôm rubbing their nose in it. So I‚Äôve been keeping it to myself how excited I am (it‚Äôs been 3 months but to me it‚Äôs still brand new) And now I‚Äôm just happy to have put that out there. 

Thanks for letting me brag :) . "
20,Went from being told I cannot join a team that leads specific projects at my last company to leading the project at my new company! 
21,"Out of curiosity how did that work out for you? 
I have a fairly similar story of moving away from family-I‚Äôm English and moved to America for my now husband- I‚Äôm in my early 20s, we knew each other for a year and I ended up moving here, and now we‚Äôre married! It wasn‚Äôt the easiest thing to tell my family and friends. Thankfully, my husband and I get on amazingly, I‚Äôm still extremely happy and very grateful because I was aware of what could possibly go wrong. My friends and family came around pretty quickly too, although we all miss eachother! "
22,My husband is such a better man 7 years into our marriage than he was going into it. I‚Äôm so proud of him.. and us. 
23,lmao I got this as a kid too but I legit have an extremely loud voice and normally I don't even notice
24,"Hey ‚Äúactually‚Äù while _shaving_ of the armpit might have been cooked up by King Gillette in that era to sell razors, removal of the armpit hairs goes way, way back. Plucking and hair removal of the pits &amp; pubes is mentioned as a requirement in the Koran and it is known that the women of Ancient Rome did similar. ;)"
25,"Damn, I'd read that post..."
26,I actually love myself.
27,It looks better then mine lol
28,Very influencing. Not into chubby men at all. I‚Äôm attracted to thin men as long they‚Äôre not unusually thin. Other than that lean muscle is the best but not required if their body is still attractive
29,"Got dumped totally out of the blue by someone I really liked and saw a future with last weekend. But I spent this week kicking ass at my new job, handling a huge workload, and looking great in front of my bosses. Feels so damn good!"
30,"How quiet is 'relatively'? I bought an Orlena, same sort of thing, and while it works, it is *loud* - there's no way I'm using it, I don't need all my neighbors hearing it."
31,"As someone who has always been in the gym, not particularly always in shape, but never lifted heavy. I just started to do this. I'm at about 85% body weight for my dead lift and 95lbs for my bench. Haven't tried that 100 yet... Wrist injury halted my new found project. 
Congrats!!"
32,"Pretty quickly, maybe 3-6 dates. It usually lines up with when I want to have sex with them. If I didn‚Äôt trust them in my apartment then why would I trust them in my body?

That said, I do not do sleepovers (at my place or theirs) unless things are really serious and at least 6 months in. Even then, I think of it as a decision for emergencies only. I sleep dreadfully with another person in my space. And then feel monstrously irritable the next day."
33,"Yes, at least that is what my mom means.  I can't help but hear it that way from others too because of association"
34,This isnt a personal advice subreddit. Having a vagina doesnt mean we somehow read other vagina-owners' minds anyways.
35,"I don't, personally."
36,"Being submissive. There are a lot of cases in my life where I end up having to be the one making decisions and taking care of things, so it's nice, sometimes, to be expected to just cede control and follow someone else's orders."
37,Yup I think I‚Äôm really chill and open to different perspectives too. Haha you have a beautiful day too! :) I love Reddit!
38,A bit distant but getting better üòÑ
39,Dr. Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds
40,"Omg this is my parents. They turned a blind eye to my sister doing drugs, and even drank and smoked weed with her while she was underage. My step mom is only 12 years older than me, and had my sister when she was 17. I feel like she‚Äôs trying to relive her younger years by being more of a friend to my younger sister than a mom. "
41,He‚Äôs my best friend.
42,Did you read the question correctly?
43,"IKR. HAHAHAHAHA and if I remember correctly, he did it over text. My gosh. What a dick move. Like who did the think he was? :/

I was too insecure about myself to tell him off back then. I just thought it was my problem for feeling mad at him because I never been in a relationship before. Now I know better. 

Back then, I should have just told him, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your promises, thanks. Just save us all the unnecessary trouble and go date that other girl.‚Äù 

"
44,"Specifics/context matter, so I can only provide general advice:

1) Be an attentive/active listener. 
2) In less agitated times, learn each others prefered comforting style. This video should provide direction: https://youtu.be/bY3As3lKMno

The basic prompt to ask each other is ""how--ideally--would you like to be comforted?"".
3) Learn each other's love languages and provide said love language at appropriate times and regular intervals.
4) Understand that things change and that you should be able to adapt to new applications of providing comfort if the established way isn't appropriate or just not working. 
5) Don't be yourself up for not doing as well as expected. Sometimes providing comfort can blow-up in your face and that's okay! Reaffirm your genuine care and support for one another and just regroup later at less agitated times. 
6) Continously build on your emotional intelligence.

Those are the things off the top off my head.

60,"I actually ended up becoming well-versed in that truth over the course of my time at that company. But I posted the story less to the point that HR treated my coworker poorly a more that there are shady people working at shady companies* so you can‚Äôt always trust reviews. 

*I recognize that HR being HR is not that shady, but there was a lot of other shit at this company, and HR did contribute to the toxic work environment. "

and despite being raised by a verbally abusive, shitty broke parent, i got my butt through college and now make 73k a year. "
63,"Boundaries are so important! Brene Brown says that the most compassionate people are the most Boundaried people, and the more I learn about that, the more I see that it's true. I want to be a compassionate and kind person, so it's important that I have boundaries. I didn't learn this as a child, so I've been working on it, too.

Fewer people get the flu but it makes you really really sick, you can't go to work or do things you normally do, and it can kill you. But people who haven't had the flu think that a bad cold is the same thing as the flu, so you can just ""get over it""/""walk it off.""

I'm gifting him a small bear, a card, and some alcoholic cookies but want something heartfelt also included and not what sure that could be."
75,"Constantly comparing your child to this or that who is prettier, has better grades, is perfect, etc.  
  
Attributing your child responsibilities that are just straight up inappropriate for a kid, or confiding in them as if they're adults (or expecting them to act like adults, in general).  
  
Being unreasonably controlling. You shouldn't really get to cherry pick your kid's friends.  
  
Not letting them express any negative emotion or dismissing them for it.  
  
My mum was fun."
76,That's great!!!!! CONGRATS 
77,"I had to take my 14 month old son to the ER on Tuesday because his fever spiked so high &amp; he was basically limp. Turns out he has the flu...one of the nurses asked if I wanted a popsicle for him &amp; I told her no thank you, I had brought pedialyte popsicles from home. She called other nurses in the room telling them how I had brought popsicles for my son &amp; telling me I was mom of the week &amp; how no one comes that prepared. 

I have suffered from postpartum depression since having my twins...this was literally the nicest, most genuine thing anyone has said to me. "
78,"For career success, my aunt (who raised me) truly believes that I will get hired and interviewed more often if I lose weight.  No one can tell how much I weight on a resume and, on that note, I'm also not large in the least.  However, she was SHOCKED when she discovered my large friend had a job before me in our field.  

She's never mentioned weight to my brother.  Ever.

Also, apparently, she believes I'll get hired immediately if I look more like the American dream: tan, blonde, thin, etc.  I'm pale, brunette, and ""thick.""

I've never followed her advice on this and managed to get a well paying job and many interviews.  I have even had connections recommend and forward me to employers."

84,I'm just teasing. Glad you have a good sense of humor. 
85,I feel good. So far I have been able to turn it down when people offer. It wasn‚Äôt really by a specific choice. I moved to a different city where I didn‚Äôt know anyone so I kind of just broke the circle. It was definitely very hard at first. Now I don‚Äôt even think about it.  
86,It was very hard at first but now I feel so good! 
87,"I wouldn‚Äôt say that this makes someone a *bad* parent, but it certainly has a negative effect on kids:  parents who engage in negative self talk.  In other words, parents who always comment about how awful they themselves look or how bad they themselves are at xyz.  Kids often pick up on that behavior and internalize it. "
88,"My ex coworker called me hot! We were out drinking and we‚Äôre between bars. I was talking about how one of the kitchen cooks kinda liked me and I was confused. She said something along the lines of ‚ÄúZapp it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre hot. If I was a lesbian I would date you.‚Äù


It made me feel so good! "
89,Congratulations! I don't know if it's a humble-brag but it's definitely brag-worthy! :)
90,üòÇ Europe has a lot more countries to be fair! We‚Äôve got more chances!
91,"I mean, really shaving armpits is the trend.  Women didn't routinely shave any body hair for most of human history (except in a few specific locations, but men in those places also removed much or all of their hair) and only started doing it in the West, and America specifically, about 100 years ago.  The trend was going to end eventually, now seems like as good a time as any.  Honestly, razor burn is the worst and I have to shave daily in order for the hair to be completely invisible, so I'm pretty happy about it.  "
92,"I always want to brag about speaking several languages (Spanish, English, Japanese, German, learning French and Italian and in a few months hopefully will take ASL classes) but choose not to because people start judging me for being ‚Äúyoung‚Äù (23) and try to make me speak all of them and that makes me uncomfortable so whatev. Because it‚Äôs like trying to prove a point for them?? I guess.

But I die inside everytime I hear people pronouncing Japanese words wrongly and I wanna correct them but I know it would only cause friction so nope üòÇ 
"
93,"that how someone views food is a huge, enormous dealbreaker for me. he could be the cutest in the world with the best dimples and smell like heaven, but if he can't cook a good meal, orders chicken tenders when we go out, and won't even try food before decided he doesn't like it, i'm just not into it. "
94,"I ran for 16 minutes straight on the treadmill!!
I could only run for 7 minutes 3 weeks ago."
95,Yes! Like I hate that my cumulative GPA was a 3.35 but I love explaining to people how that's with a semester earning 0.28. I'm soooo proud of the resiliency I learned and showed immediately after that semester. 
96,It says a lot that one of the best jokes of the series comes from the first minute of the first episode.
97,"I practice belly dancing in my room when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôd die of embarrassment if anyone saw me, but it‚Äôs fun and relaxing for me and it gives me some peace about my body. "
98,"I can read very fast, and people do make remarks about this, but it feels so rude to say it myself. 

I recently took part in a linguistics research regarding reading, and the people guiding the study were so impressed by how ""remarkably fast"" I read. It's my talent :') "
99,Last night I pulled my shit together and stayed up until 5:30am finishing report cards that were due this morning at 9am.
100,I have a couple reasons for not wanting to talk about it - I want to build the habit as something I do for me and not for any sort of attention.  I just want it to be a thing I do that isn't for social capital or to prove I'm a 'good fat person' because my body size is so political.  Its not so much caring about what other people think/say so much as personal pease :)
101,Get it giiiiirl!!! I can relate too. It‚Äôs an awesome feeling to feel so sexually free! 
102,"I'm a serious, glum, intelligent person. People assumed I was sweet, sexy, and kind of dumb and innocent. I used to be very shy (NOT anymore) and people treated me badly for that, too. Blonde is just a color, but people don't treat it that way. They create a personality for you before they've even met you. I think redheads experience the same thing. I feel like now that I'm brunette (and a lot older and ornier) they tend to get to know me before judging. "
103,"I moved across the world by myself at 18. I learned a lot about myself and the world around me, learned to love my hometown in a new way, and learned to truly believe that I can do anything that I put my mind to. Sometimes it was lonely, but I built a whole life for myself here. I‚Äôm so damn proud of it. "
104,"Can you explain what you mean by Eurocentric? Cos a lot of minorities look European but with dark skin so they would still be considered attractive.

I think the differences between people's self esteem will not be based on their ethnicity as you can obviously have an ethnicity and fit the beauty standards. It's more about symmetry and I think assymetry is more noticeable to people when looking at minorities."
105,"You said it girl, agree 100%"
106,"Do you really think Chuck could fool this guys killdar? He's been revealed, Chuck is a murderer!"
107,"I'm a sex worker, and I'm so so good at my job. Not just the sex (I mean that too I can swallow a dick whole) but he connection part of it. I'm so good at making men feel good about themselves. It used to be an issue where abusive men would prey on me because I was so good at nurturing and taking care of them and making them feel loved. But I've found a way to monetize it, and because of screening I can make sure I don't see any abusers. So I just get to make money by making good people who might be sad or lonely, feel really amazing about themselves, even for one night.

There's something about me that makes people genuinely happy and that's really cool. "
108,woah!
109,"Good luck, how exciting!"
110,"I really love ethical clothing, ESPECIALLY vintage fashion!! So nice to see some for bigger ladies too :)"
111,"I several years ago reconnected with him over Facebook after him not being around my whole life. Surprisingly we're pretty close considering, and I have yet to actually meet up with him again since I was little. I feel pretty close to him and I don't hold his past against him. He's talked me through things and helped me more than some others who have been around my whole life."
112,"Agreed, that's pretty grim stuff. Unfortunately I've run into those parents and it blows my mind. "
113,Very true. I was thinking of the 20th-century Western trend.
114,"As the trendy 20-something, I agree. Never heard of that brand before. Lazy Oaf, Dolls Kill, and Valfre are really in right now."
115,"Well I can tell you why parents did it (past tense because my dad literally just signed up the other day). My dad didn‚Äôt want to have his own account because of his job. He had the idea that it would inappropriate and didn‚Äôt want his employees to be able to see his personal life. So he used my moms account to browse. Now though, I think he realized how very normal it is to have social media, regardless of you job, position, etc. "
116,"I don't have a relationship with a Capital F ""Father"" as that  generally refers to a god type figure, and I identify as a godless heathen. I've got  a pretty decent relationship with my bio-dad and the man who raised me though. "
117,"Kinda related to your first point, also dressing up their children like mini models but then seem careless about things related to their health - vaccines, teeth, general hygiene, feeding, etc."
118,Thank you so much for your kind words! This was a great pick me up! üòäüòä
119,I'm currently tenth in my class!
120,"I have a lot of respect and affection for my dad. He has always been there when I needed him. Our relationship is decent but I should spend more time with him. 

Also thanks for posting this because I do need to spend more time with him."
121,Can I be your friend
122,"The Etsy shop TurtlesSoup has very cute cards that go I love giving out aw gifts. Worth glancing at!

123,Well forget that jerk! Happy birthday!!
124,I'm proud of you! 
125,"Its not that good when I am too short with him or easily get upset.

But I am just starting to realize that. So because of that it‚Äôs not that great. I barely speak to him unfortunately "
126,I'm going to be 35 this year and when most people meet me they think I am in my early 20s. I recently go hit on by a 19 year old cause he thought I looked 21. I'm not afraid of aging and looking older but it is nice to look young. 
127,I married a loser and bought a house before I was ready.  Finances destroyed for a decade.
128,I had four job interviews this week and got offered a position at all of them! 
129,"That‚Äôs fucking awesome. My boyfriend works in IT in a school and since they introduced a makerspace class with a female instructor, there‚Äôs more girls than ever in the computer and robotics clubs! It really is important to kids to have a positive role model they can identify with."
130,"I take out $40 cash when I get paid, and give myself $20 a week to buy breakfast or lunch at work. Whatever is left over at the end of the week goes in a mason jar. Then that's my little random emergency fund."
131,Please what‚Äôs your secret 
132,Very.
133,"Well I can kind of turn off my gag reflex. Learnt how to do it years ago. 

Plus I'm a trained opera singer so I have a  pretty controllable soft palette and jaw muscles. Strange skills transfer but it stands nevertheless. "
134,How do you get into something like this? Is there a corporation that helps with the mailing and all that jazz or do you just have to secure a private PO Box? 
135,"I shower as normal. I used to use those Summer's  Eve scented wipes until I learned about important the ph-balance is and that I shouldn't be ashamed of my natural smell. So, you can use unscented, non-chemical, and unmedicated baby wipes. I didn't use them a lot, since I tried to change my pad often enough but if you're feeling a little icky, those are good. They are sensitive enough for a baby, so why not you? That's what I used to do before I got my IUD. I use baby wipes for a lot of stuff now, tbh."
136,"Fellow survivor here, good work! Always feel proud and be kind to yourself :-)"
137,"I am *super* intuitive. I'm nearly done with schooling for a degree which requires a ton of digital programming, and multiple different programs. Learning them was a piece of cake, and I'm thankful to be able to spend hours on a project rather than a single issue I don't understand. However, that means I'm the tech gal when one of my peers have a question! "
138,"Ladies take charge of the kitchen, including all prep and cleanup, while the men stay talking at the table/waiting to be served/watching TV"
139,"So far, it‚Äôs never happened. But I‚Äôve also learned from experience that going to his place isn‚Äôt great either. If he‚Äôs crazy/waiting for you to get comfortable around him so he can start being abusive and make it seem like it‚Äôs your fault ‚Äî which in my case has happened every time ‚Äî you don‚Äôt wanna be on their turf either. It‚Äôs preferable to them pulling some shit on me in my own home, which would literally drive me insane. But still very risky. "
140,"The microwave. I decided not to get one when I moved to a new house where it wasn't included, and so far I haven't missed it at all *and* it's been months since I last bought microwave meals. It got to a point that I always did it when I felt down or tired, even though I didn't really enjoy it, it was more of a quick convenience thing.  
  
The phone. I barely use it as it is and always having to be available makes me kinda anxious."
141,holy shit GO YOUUUU!!!!
142,"Maybe because they're too socially awkward to do so, like me."
143,I'd tell her to be a better mom and leave me alone.
144,Once.
145,"Nice!!! I'm a vegan now but I was vegetarian for like 10 years. Its a good thing to do ;) if you ever feel like moving further into the dark side, hmu. I've got tips and tricks."
146,i love that this is an ask on here and on my front page. that's all i want to say for now. and go you to everyone and all their awesome accomplishments.
147,"In case you miss the live version, I love [this rehearsal video of Jessie Mueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDDqIxGk9pg)"
148,"I went to visit my alcoholic father today
I haven't seen him in over two years and haven't been to where he lives in over nine years.
He was drunk and said somethings what would previously have really hurt usually causing me to react and a pretty horrible aggressive not funness  time.
Today I didn't react I didn't let it hurt me and I'm pretty proud of myself.
"
149,"I'm in the process of losing weight, but I am fat. As much as guys (on Reddit) say they wouldn't mind being approached by a woman even if they find her unattractive, in real life I've heard a lot of guys complaining about being approached by certain types of women. "
150,"You'd be surprised how much you remember! If you are generally exposed to scientific or chemistry concepts for your main job, it isn't too hard to teach at the high school level.

I did overestimate my abilities though, because the first time I was placed with an AP Chemistry student, and she was doing homework about weak acids and weak bases, I had no idea what I was doing. So I do AP Biology/AP Environmental Science, but not AP Chemistry. "
151,I didn't know that! That's amazing. I definitely listened to her version/album of the songs before the OBCR was out. She Used To Be Mine never changed like some other songs and that makes me so happy. 
152,"Lol your mom's ignorance about makeup is sort of endearing!

Yeah, same here. If my mom actively told me I needed makeup to look good, I'd be pretty upset."
153,People got offended and became cold shoulderish to me when I did. This solidified my choice to get that clutter out of my life 
154,"I used to approach men all the time and was the initiator in online dating interactions more often than not.

Those experiences taught me that approaching will win you the interest of men who are into you only because you're available, not because they're actually attracted to you as an individual. Plus, if you set the expectation that you'll be the initiator, they tend to get incredibly fucking lazy and complacent, and then they'll just discard you as soon as a woman they actually want comes along.

It just isn't worth it in the long run."
155,"At the time, I was prosecuting cases. I'm aware that a defendant asserting his 5th amendment right certainly does not equal guilt. However, people asked for his side of the story, and I wanted to clarify that because it isn't his burden to provide one, there wasn't one for me to share. 

That having been said, he pleaded guilty, and there are at least three witnesses who did testify, under oath, to what they witnessed, which was consistent with what the complainant testified to. "
156,"I, too, am interested in these ""tricks and things."" "
157,"I remember when I was in a thrift store recently, I saw a skirt from APC for $15, with tags, original price $190. I still kick myself for not flipping it. Would it have gone well if I went to Wasteland or Crossroads to flip it?"
158,Wow! Totally hoping to be in your shoes one day! 
159,"I‚Äôm a MENSA member. Took the test bc an ex was all ‚Äúsurely you‚Äôre not as smart as me.‚Äù I passed, he failed, dumped his sorry ass. 

Then went on to attend law school at night while working a full time job and passed the CA bar exam on the first try after self study. 

This was 10+ years ago, time to rack up some new wins. Been feeling bleh, and this thread is super motivating!"
160,"My mom says the same thing to me, even though most days I just wear mascara and concealer. If I wear eyeliner she points it out... but most girls I see wear that every day.

I also went to my friend's wedding and had a friend (who does makeup) do my makeup. My friend's (the bride) mom gave me the dirtiest look, I presume because I made the effort to wear any makeup. It was a weird feeling. I never go to weddings to upstage the bride. I wore a pretty modest and conservative dress and my hair wasnt elaborately done. I'm not showing up to someone's wedding bare-faced. It's still a time to look put together, even as a guest."
161,"Sometimes you don't need to ask. It's what they don't tell you. 
1. Who your HR is.
2. What your options are for growth.
3. If they mention ""tight knit"" or ""family"", run. This is usually used as an excuse to treat people poorly. ""You're a part of the family now, that's why they treat you like crap""

4. If they give you a tour and the other workers look tired/ unhappy.
5. Look for osha posters/ info in places specifically meant to be found. (Break room, time clock)
6. Suggestion box. If the boss man/woman insists that they are a ""growing"" company and doesn't have a suggestion box, it usually means they are growing financially and they don't mind replacing people to achieve their numbers. "
162,This is my third time going back to college. I usually have a hard time keeping up with work and finishing assignmments. I'm finishing my first class and I have an A. So I hope to keep the ball rolling!
163,"This made me think of all the things i think i'm good at. And there is so much more than i would normally give myself credit for. Thank you for making me think of this! 

-I'm really stubborn- but in healthy ways. If my car breaks down i will do my best i can even if it means leaving it in a parking lot for three days until i figure it out. And i normally always do. Which now makes me goid at mechanics. Boys i know ask me for help often and I gotta say it feels great to have that upper hand.

I'm able to give up when things aren't right anymore.

-this may be less of a brag, but jesus do I ever forgive people who've really done me wrong. I don't give them excuses, but i try to allow them (in my head) to be as they are. That they are having a rough time and feel bad for them for being able to do bad things. And i can still love them. Like a lot. Friends, family, exes. Compassion! It doesnt mean i dont forget. 

-like I said, im stubborn. Which allows me to excel so much in education, sports, knowledge on nutrition, arts and crafts, changing parts on phones on my own. I'm hands on and I'm great at it. "
164,"I use pads. I take a shower less on my period because I generally feel gross and don't wanna do things that require effort, and also because it's annoying to have to triple check that there isn't any blood anywhere. I shower once every 2 to 3 days during my period, as opposed to my usual once per day. And yeah sometimes I use baby wipes"
165,"I‚Äôm 23 and am a primary quality analyst for my department on a migraine drug that hit the market very recently (I‚Äôm a contract worker, so I can‚Äôt say more than that, but you may have seen a commercial for it recently)! I struggled running assays at first, the learning curve was pretty steep as most of my experience is in HPLC rather than ELISA/bioassay, but I‚Äôve gotten a lot better at getting tight numbers on my assays, which is exciting. I never realized it, but being left handed in a lab where things are oriented for right-handers can definitely make things take a little more practice, but I‚Äôm glad that my effort is paying off! "
166,"I get up at 4am, to take a 1.5 hour bus drive to school, class starts at 7am and I'm out by 12pm or 1pm. I am home by 3 or 2pm due to the bus drive back, I do this Monday through Thursday while working on the weekends. I don't ask for rides, I don't complain and just make sure to stay awake. I did something similar last semester, took 17 units, and made it to the Dean's list, now taking 16 units. I don't tell many people because I don't want to seem like I'm bragging or think I'm better than them."
167,"I have only ever missed one day of work since I was 14 (turning 24 this year) and that one day was when I got hit by a car, and I was still able to find someone to cover my shift so it wasn‚Äôt left. "
168,"I just won THREE design awards, I got a new hair cut that looks amazing, and I shaved my legs and lady bits up for the first time since summer so I feel amazing! Also my makeup and my skin have been EXTRA good lately even though I‚Äôm smack in the middle of the polar vortex. ANNNND my outfit is cute today instead of my usual hoodie and jeans. 

(I can‚Äôt talk about this stuff and I feel guilty for feeling good because my future FIL is extremely sick right now and everything‚Äôs been revolving around that so thank you for this post)"
169,"I'm 40, have a GED, grew up dirt poor.  I've been in retail management for almost 10 years. I'm good at what I do, but I don't love what I do. I have always wanted to be a teacher, so I enrolled in college and am on my way to doing what I've always wanted to do, help children learn! I also bought my first brand new car recently! About to hit 2 years with the most wonderful man I've ever known, and going to move to the mountains, which has been a dream of mine.  I feel like my hard work and sacrifices through all these years are finally paying off! Life keeps getting better! "
170,"Nice! I have a really hard time waking up to do solo exercise activities, so I think that's impressive :)"
171,So fucking cool.
172,YES
173,Just Euronext from Sally Beauty! Although I have found it has taken two sets to get the look I really want. 
174,"This is SO important! And also a broader range of people on the Autistic Spectrum in the media would be nice. My best friend has Asperger‚Äôs, and people don‚Äôt believe her because she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúact‚Äù the way someone with Asperger‚Äôs ‚Äúshould.‚Äù "
175,They put weight on your driver's licence? Why would that be needed?
176,"Odin sent one daughter to rule the underworld because she was too powerful in Asgard and he wanted to weaken her. The other one he put to sleep forever inside a ring of fire because she disobeyed him once. When her true love Sigurd woke her, but later died, she put him into a funeral pyre and threw herself into it because Odin refused to heal her lover or reunite them in Valhalla.

Tony Stark seems like he'd forget my dance recital or my soccer game, and buy me a car to make up for it. Nah. Sticking with Tony.

"
177,"It would be awesome to see more nuanced Asian-American characters in the media. Fresh Off The Boat did a good job bucking the stereotype for Asian men, but it would be great to see a broader range of personalities for Asian women characters as well. Also, it would be great to see more Filipino and Pacific Islander people in the media. The only Filipino character I can think of is Josh from Crazy Ex Girlfriend. "
178,I changed my own flat tire in the middle of the polar vortex without help!!
179,"Really cool, and I wish I could be as talented as some other women wrt makeup"
180,Yes!
181,"Yeah, it‚Äôs a good field to get into. Work on getting certifications, they‚Äôll open doors for you! üòä"
182,I restarted a few months ago and I'm determined to find all those damned koroks
183,"I just dropped off three dozen chocolate chip cookies and a loaf of banana bread for tomorrow. Other days it will be something different. They have other people who do beautifully decorated cakes and things. I do the sort of thing your mom might have put in your lunch as a kid, if you were lucky. "
184,"Took my MCAT, graduated with my BSc summa cum Laude in 2.5 years, got into medical school, got kicked out of medical school all in 6 months. That shit took talent."
185,"I'm super-impressed!

I knew someone who fell in love with a Finnish girl and learned the language because -- I don't know. He is an amazingly talented person. Their relationship ended tragically, so he never got a chance to use the language. He likes to humble-brag about how difficult it is, though."
186,Athletic person here...most of us aren't shallow and don't compare to boost our own egos. We just want to see you improve JUST LIKE WE HAVE. Many of us where where you currently are. Keep your head up :)
187,Nice job sticking through it! 
188,Thank you for doing that :)
189,That is awesome!! I‚Äôm slowly but surely starting to run more. I average about a ten minute mile which I know is pretty slow for some folks but two weeks ago I did 6 miles in juuust under an hour! I was thrilled with myself! 
190,"Being waitstaff sucks, humans are the worst! "
191,"SO proceeds to tell me how great my life is and because I have all these things, he doesn‚Äôt feel sorry for me/think I have anything to feed ‚Äòsad‚Äô about. People who haven‚Äôt dealt with depression usually give shit advice. "
192,"With a hug, and maybe offer to take her out shopping or something fun :)"
193,Congrats! I hope you get it :)
194,"I have no talents, no higher education, no friends, but my life is going stupidly great.

I pulled myself by the bootstraps out of lifelong depression and attempted suicides. I'm fucking proud of myself!"
195,I finally figured out how to start paying off debt. I‚Äôm 40. 
196,"I've thought about doing this, but I'm so far removed from what they teach in chemistry classes in middle/high school so I'm not very confidant about my abilities...."
197,Thank you :)
198,I know a few people who have hike the AT and all of them said that it was amazing. Have fun! :)
199,"Dang. Never met something more relatable. My b-day was always the weekend right before school started growing up so everyone would be on their last vacation before the end of the summer. Was it something to do with the date for your birthday, or do people just suck?"
200,"After years and years of severe phobia surrounding dentists (I‚Äôm talking suicidal over 4th grade braces, throwing up from fear, etc) I went to the dentist by myself for a cleaning with no sedatives/medication/nitrous and didn‚Äôt cry until I got home. Didn‚Äôt even recognize myself, it‚Äôs amazing. Granted I only went because I thought my teeth were going to fall out (turns out I was just paranoid) but I think a medication I started for anxiety last year has been super helpful, plus a great dentist and the fact that I can‚Äôt rely on nitrous because their office isn‚Äôt set up for it. I never ever thought this day would come. "

206,I got my first ever A on a university assignment this week. I had to retake my first year because I failed badly so getting an A is something really amazing for me. 
207,What did you start in and what did you switch to? I did the same (I'm in an MS program that's very different from my BS major) and I'm absolutely loving it.
208,"Whenever I was pregnant with my Son I managed to escape any kind of stretch marks! There's to much of a debate over if tiger stripes are sexy or not. I personally think they aren't which is why I slathered myself in lotion everyday and I'm very proud of myself. Had someone tell me that I wasn't a real mom unless I had stretch marks.üôÑ

209,"Last year I finished my Masters and got offered a job with the company I did my placement with.

210,"Since recently being thrust back into the dating pool, this question has come up quite a bit. I am a single mother, but share my home with my 2 kids, 6 and 11, and my father.

213,"I usually follow up with specifics, particularly if there's an area I particularly want to develop. I'll ask stuff like who delivers the training (internal or external), is it accredited, and what's the format (workshops, lectures, conferences?). Sure they could still lie but it's easier to call it out later down the line if you have details so they can't just pass it off as vague promises.

On another note, have you taken the initiative in looking into training and development opportunities? If your company doesn't offer it, are there any external providers you could look into and approach your managers about? As a manager I'm always super happy to let my employees go on some training or course they're interested in if it supports their professional development. Or if they ask me directly to look into something for them. If you've tried all that and still nothing, I'm sorry and maybe it's time to consider what you can do outside of work for professional development if you're unhappy with where you are."
214,I'm only 25 with no college degree and I'm landing a spot on the board of my company and I'm buying my first house this year with 30 acres!
215,"I forgave my MIL and BIL more times than I can possibly count for severe mental and even physical abuse. I always wanted to make peace because I just didn't understand that families sometimes don't get along. My husband wanted to cut them out of our lives years ago but I always insisted that families don't act like that. 


Holy shit was he right and I was wrong. "
216,I went deaf in one ear for a few days during my second trimester. That was fun. 
217,"I always thought men who claim to be feminists where just there to try and get some recognition, and then sex later on. Like a 'nice guy' irl who will one day be brought to his boiling point only to show his true side. Then again I love to believe that there are genuine feminist men who fight for a cause they actually believe in."
218,"I have a bar a few blocks away where I used to get a drink or two by myself at least once a week. It would just be me and a few other regulars. We would chat with the bartenders (we knew them pretty well after so many post-work drinks), i would order wings or fries, maybe 2 vodka tonics, and would almost always get one or two extra on the house. It was nice! I would get hit on by people that randomly fake into the bar, but the bartenders were always good to steer the guys away from talking to me by drawing them into a conversation. 

I loved it. Just chatting or using my phone, eating some decent food, and not sitting in the apartment was nice. "
219,Don't talk so loudly!
220,"I own and operate a women's vintage store that only carries size L and up on etsy. I believe really strongly that ""slow fashion"" and ethical, sustainable clothing in the form of vintage should be accessible to all bodies! "
221,"Not to take anything away from you, but you don't really _need_ to know Finnish if you live here, like in any nordic country. Everybody under 60 can understand English well enough so you'd get by. It may be a little isolating if you don't understand others, tho, so learning it for the sake of that is smart.

I have a uni teacher who has lived in Finland close to 20 years and the Finnish she speaks is still horrible and everyone just prefers her to use her native language. But it's not like language is in any way an obstacle between people. No one takes her less seriously because she doesn't speak very well herself.

I, personally, only know 1 person who has learned Finnish in his adult years and sounds like a native. All the strong consonants etc. makes Finnish very difficult to master. But good for you for learning it! I think expression-wise my beloved language is much more poetic than English or Swedish. Most song lyrics for example lose their flow if make them too complex in other languages, but thanks to Finnish post-positioning and other grammatic shenanigans you'll just sound runic if you go overboard. There are many bands from Finland that sing in Finnish but are still popular abroad thanks to their Tolkien-esque sound, and I just pity the fans for missing half the fun for not REALLY understanding it."
222,"Cos it's embarrassing especially after you may have defended your point so defiantly.

It also depends on how gracious the other person is. If they're aggressively trying to get you to admit the truth or taking an ""I told you so"" or ""ha you're wrong"" approach then that sort of childishness is only going to be met with defensiveness and childishness in return."
223,"Surely you saw Crazy Rich Asians?  Isn't it set to become a series?

"
224,"I don‚Äôt really have an opinion on them. If guys can do it, why can‚Äôt women? Personally, I‚Äôm obsessive with shaving my armpits because I get really nasty BO, even with deodorant, if I don‚Äôt shave them every other day. But most people don‚Äôt have this problem, so why judge? "
225,"(1) I find the ‚Äúgot dragged‚Äù because someone genuinely tried to do something nice and didn‚Äôt immediately do it perfectly to be so goddamn tiresome.

(2) would love to see more media about people who live with disabilities or medical issues where it‚Äôs not the center of the storyline. Even with stuff like acne or IBS or whatever. "
226,People tell me I‚Äôm a good singer and dancer because I‚Äôm black and black people are always good at that kind of thing. The truth is I was a terrible singer and dancer until about 3 years ago when I decided I wanted to bring out my inner Beyonc√© and starting taking singing lessons and dance classes online. It was just hard work and dedication people!
227,"Photography. 

Side hustle might become the main gig soon..."
228,"I‚Äôve never noticed him doing that. If he does it discretely, I don‚Äôt care at all, but if he‚Äôs obviously ogling someone, it would make me feel uncomfortable because that would be creepy for that poor woman and myself. "
229,Daaaaaaaaaamn. Congratulations!!
230,"Eh. In mythology, she was actually Loki's daughter and ruled Niflheim, which was the ice world of the dead. Given that Surt was a fire giant, I would guess no?

And my knowledge is not at all extensive. I like reading about various mythologies, and the Norse legends are definitely fun, if dark. 

Fun fact! Hel (on whom MCU based Hela) was a half giant, and half-sister to Fenrir.

Loki was a freak, man."
231,"I work really hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish ""relentless determination to be good at something even after failing repeatedly"" was easier to quantify. I'm not naturally smart, but I'll work really hard to get something.

Lifting, where I started at a 145lb deadlift, and worked my ass off to get 363lbs in two and a half years.

School, where in high school I just coasted math, but when I had to retake it to get into school, I spent hours every day studying to get a fantastic grade."
232,"My native languages are Irish and English. I speak them every day with family amd friends.

French - I'm taking some classes in French this semester and my roommate is half-French, so I speak it with her.

Spanish - I live in Spain and use it every day. My classes are also all in Spanish  (apart from the two in French).

Portuguese - My university doesn't offer Portuguese classes, so I study at home in my free time with books and online resources. I have a good friend who is half-Portuguese and another who is Brazilian, so I speak with them.

German - I don't practice this as much as I should. I tend to speak to my German friends in Spanish. The odd time I will watch a few YouTube videos in German, but not often. This is the language I know least.

Italian - I use books and online resources for this too. I'm thinking of getting a tutor so I can have more opportunities to speak it."
233,"I'm planning on it once I lose 5 more lbs actually, thanks!"
234,I don‚Äôt.
235,"I just graduated college a month ago, and had my dream job lined up a month before I graduated. Been on my own financially since I was 18 (now 22). Three years ago I almost committed suicide due to the relationship I was in and what was going on in life. 2016 was a shitty year. It‚Äôs gotten so much better since then. Always remember to keep your chin up. "

240,"I normally will chat up anyone (unless I‚Äôm *really* just not in the mood, but that‚Äôs rare). I love meeting people. But when they forcibly try to turn the conversation sexual or try too hard to flirt, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm put off... "
241,"Mahtava! Finnish is a very hard language to learn- my dad is a Finn and I still don‚Äôt speak it fluently, lol. Great job in learning it! :D What sparked the interest? "

246,Congrats! It's absolutely insane that you were able to work full-time and get good grades; you must be great at time-management :)
247,"Welcome to the club! If you do cheat occasionally, don't worry, it can take a bit of time to adjust :)"
248,"Omg I‚Äôve got one!  After years and years of writing stories in my head and dreaming of ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù an author, I finally started writing my first novel.


"
249,"I know what you mean.

I was into computer when I was a teen. But between people making fun of it, the belief that they were only boys in it and I would be the only girl that would suck, I didn't pursued it.

Fastforward 15 years later, I needed to switch careers. And into IT I went. I'm still kind of a newbie, it's my first job in the field, but I'm so happy with what I'm doing now !"
250,"Wow, this was like reading a list that I wrote! These are all changes I started making gradually over the last few years that have made my life substantially more peaceful, organized, and pleasant.  "
251,"i hope you have people who you can feel proud in front of! about this! argh, words. "
252,everything  üòÑ except my feet they are ugly
253,Woo that‚Äôs amazing! Who cares about athletic people standards it‚Äôs about you and your progress not theirs. I say this as a fit person who also can‚Äôt talk about gym stuff because it feels like I‚Äôm bragging. We should all talk about it more and encourage each other. Keep up the great work you‚Äôll be amazed what you can do!
254,I will hit 100 consecutive days of yoga on Februsry 8th!
255,"Cuz I have other hobbies and never thought about it. Still not going to cuz not my kinda thing, but this was interesting"

259,Life goals for us that have had a horrible childhood or bad parenting. Good for you!
260,I‚Äôve lost a total of 25lbs since July and I‚Äôm back down to my pre-pregnancy weight finally. I‚Äôm in the lowest pant size I‚Äôve been since i was 20. It feels so good to actually LIKE what i see in the mirror. 
261,"I just interviewed for an internal promotion which would be my first supervisory role ever. I was asked not only by management to apply but by my fellow coworkers (who would directly report to me if I got the role). But what I‚Äôm most proud of is this is the first time I‚Äôve ever tried being good at a job *not* in order to get a promotion *but for personal satisfaction* ‚Äî I just wanted to be good at my job for myself, full stop. The possibility of a promotion is just a bonus. "

266,This is awesome! Where do you learn the new languages from?
267,I graduated as valedictorian in a country where my parents are (hated and despised) immigrants.
268,More bisexual characters. The only show I can really think of that does it well is Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.
269,"People with chronic skin diseases like acne (not just on teenagers), psoriasis, eczema etc. "
270,Don‚Äôt mind it at all as long as they aren‚Äôt being creepy or aggressive. But just a normal conversation or comment? No problem at all.
271,"A lot of people in my life has started to treat me like shit and it‚Äôs making me very very sad (almost unbearably so, especially since I‚Äôve battled with depression most of my life) and I‚Äôm probably about to cut off 2 of the only long term friends I‚Äôve ever had because I just can‚Äôt take the overwhelming venom and toxicity anymore. It‚Äôs scary to think of being virtually alone after this but I‚Äôm tired of being a punching bag.

I‚Äôve managed to hold it all together for my dog. I‚Äôve only had him for 7 months but he was just what I needed to get me through losing my old boy (who I basically grew up with) and that little guy‚Äôs love is enough to inspire me to keep from falling to pieces no matter how much I want to.

I dunno, I think I deserve some credit for that lol"
272,I‚Äôm up for a promotion to VP at age 31! Don‚Äôt want to jinx it though so have only told my fianc√©. The suspense is killing me!!!
273,Congrats! You can definitely brag about the progress you have made!!
274,"OMG ! I will receive my nintendo next Monday ! I bought it for this game and it's my first nintendo and Zelda game in 15 years ! (I didn't have the money to buy one since I'm not at my parents' anymore)

You can be so proud ! I am for you :P"
275,I 100% agree with you

280,"Reading an average of 50 books per year!
May lot be a lot to some, but for me it was quite the achievement"
281,"I just started school again after a 3 year break that included having had a baby. I was terrified to come back to school because I was convinced that I was dumber after having had my son. The uni I'm going to is ranks highly and is a really great school, so I was doubting whether I was even good enough to attend. But I just got back my first paper and I got a 97! I worked so hard on it and it totally paid off. I'm smart guys üòÄ!"
282,Don't
283,"Thanks for the tip! 

But nah, it's a bit of a deadend job for everyone and we all know it. Very few promotional opportunities in our department. You get your experience and you get out. 

Currently looking into a few other jobs! "
284,I got a job in my field after only a 3 month job search with 0 prior working experience and I didn't know anyone prior to starting this job. I've already recruited two more people to this job and I've only been here for two months total.
285,"Don't much care, though I'm never getting intimate with randoms.  I don't do casual."
286,"Keep it up! The more you do it, the easier it gets!"
287,I think it looks nice.
288,"""You should just find more friends, I don't know why you don't try to go out with them""

""You probably just need more fresh air""  


Both quoted from my mother when I was 16 years old."
289,"I just feel so brave about my life/myself. I've been battling breast cancer over the past months with an amazingly positive attitude, supporting my hubby and my friends with lots of love in their quests (as usual) and finding new ways to see myself and to love me! I'm so damn proud :-)"
290,Thank you! I definitely have competition issues (i.e. I internally compare myself with everyone else and try to be perfect) but I'm working on them.
291,"""Get over it!""

""You should be happy, not depressed!"" "
292,Oooooooo I think I know. That's pretty cool. Once I have more space I might take up this hobby. 
293,"I have gone a full week not picking at my face. As a habitual pimple-popper, this is a huge deal for me!"
294,"If possible, I‚Äôll either go to their house or they‚Äôll come to mine and I‚Äôll provide them tea then let them vent. I have an assortment of snacks, TV shows, face masks etc. Will also offer to help them out with household tasks if they seem stressed. The important thing is not to let it get to you if you can‚Äôt make them feel better ‚Äî everyone deals with their own problems, and the important thing is to be there for them. After they‚Äôve left or if they don‚Äôt feel up to meeting, I‚Äôll offer to call or text them to see how they‚Äôre doing, and make it clear I‚Äôm available at anytime 

"
295,I recommend cocaine.
296,"I started replacing my snack food with healthy options. I like to snack in the evenings, especially during shark week. But rather than chips or cookies, I've started getting nuts and dried fruits to snack on. It satisfies that sweet or salty craving without being bad for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I started rowing one day/week. I have a rower, but I've been really bad about getting on it. I have it set up now so that I can watch a tv show while I row. I grab my water bottle, turn on a 30 minute episode of something (Grace and Frankie, currently), and row until the episode ends. I feel great during my non-lifting days and it helps me sleep better at night. Bonus, it's great cardio."
297,My dog wipes her feet and face on the welcome mat after we've been out for a walk.
298,YES GET IT GIRL!
299,24/7 news coverage
300,"I'm bisexual, so I like to check out women, I only get annoyed if my husband doesn't share his findings. In the most respectful way possible of course.

301,"if someone would have told me at 12 years old (or any time before 35 years old) to not worry about my tits because they will literally be your dream tits by 36...naturally. I dont even know what happened but


Gravity: 4,492

302,That‚Äôs brilliant. One of the more wholesome humblebrags. Thanks for sharing and good luck. 
303,"I finished making a playsuit yesterday and the finishings on all of my seams look amazing, there's no overlocking or any internal seams visible at all! It fits like a glove too. I'm chronically ill and have been especially sick for the past few months, so I don't often get to wear my creations and show them off, but tonight I'm finally going to go out and wear something special that I've made. Even though I'm just going to the movies, it feels like the most exciting thing ever and it's a really big deal for me."

While I understand if you're trying to get a job at Ulta to wear make up, anywhere else I don't see the point. My workplace as yet to see me with makeup on, and they don't seem to mind my natural face.

 I guess it didn't not work out for me."
309,"I don't know or care what the norm for other women is, but I'm just not interested in sharing sex-related details with any of my friends.  I have asked one of them about the side effects of her birth control, but that's it."
310,"It saddens my heart knowing this is ""just part of life"" for many, many women in this world. You have my deepest empathy. My chem lab partner assaulted me when he asked for a ride back to his car off campus after class."
311,I never learned how to give gold but this post deserves it.
312,Especially when you have to deal with entitled customer. 
313,The pressure on your butthole while pushing. Felt like my butthole was going to prolapse and I was freaking out about that.
314,"Yeah, maybe she's thinking of frozen meals and protein bars or something, but this also includes, say... Bread."
315,"That I didn't hate my dad anymore, but in reality, I still did. It was just my mom and me, we were on a trip to a beach town. I knew it was far from over, but my mom needed to hear something nice."
316,It's all gross. 
317,I'm a great girlfriend. I take care of my man and he does the same for me. I'm also nearing the end of my program at school! Only one more semester of classes then interning!
318,Definitely not stupid to be proud of this.
319,"Congrats!!! My husband was a linguist! Monterrey is GORGEOUS. Enjoy your time there, and definitely hit up Old Fisherman‚Äôs Grotto and have the crab ravioli. "
320,"I'm not gonna lie, that does sound pretty dangerous. I hope you do carry protection of some sort. It's awful that women have to worry about this, yet here we are. But at the end of the day, you make your own choices. I'm glad you have something that makes you happy like that!"
321,I make pretty good rice krispy treats. My own recipes and everything. Stuff like Candied Maple Bacon and Circus Peanut flavored and Birthday Cake.
322,"I'm changing flats and jobs over the weekend and I worked really hard to find them both. I'm moving in a good direction with my life, finally"

326,"Moved out at 19 with literally $20 to my name after my mom stole $1000 from my savings. Got a job in the city a few hours away. Took a train 3 hrs to work in the city and back again each day. It was an average of 6.5 hours travel Monday to Friday. Meanwhile i had chronic tonsillitis and was fatigued. Got my surgery and got leave at new job due to great performance. Saved money. Rented a small box apartment just for me, half an hour from work ‚ò∫. I'll never forget those days. Two, sometimes three jobs in my early twenties while my friends partied and shopped. Some days i only ate at work in office meetings. But i did it. I got out. Now, I'm 32, with a great guy, got my own business and live in a different country. My grandma's words echoed in my head ""nil desperado caber undem"" aka don't let the bastards grind you down. Fight. You got to fight for yourself. "
327,"Man, that's a rough one. I have two female friends in academia, both pretty high ranking. They're identical twins, and conventionally attractive. They have told me some true horror stories about the comments they've gotten from peers and superiors about their looks, and that's before their colleagues find out they have a carbon copy out in the world. I think I agree with your logic here. You don't want to get hired on somewhere because some dude on the committee with a lot of influence thinks you're cute and wants to date you, so he gets you hired (happened to one of the twins), but also you don't want to pretend to be someone you're not. I hope it works out, and you get your dream job!! Let me know how it goes if you remember? I'd love to congratulate you!"

336,That's so presumptuous and creepy.
337,"No, this doesn't seem small! I'm just beginning that type of journey (seeing a therapist to discuss co-dependency etc) and I've realized how badly I've de-prioritized myself. Just beginning to make healthy boundaries. Keep going and I will too!"
338,"We listen to a podcast together while cooking or cleaning and we pause it if we want to talk about a specific point. Usually politics, but if one of us is interested in a specific podcast we'll listen to that instead."
339,"Wow, that's amazing! How did you do it?"
340,"I don‚Äôt consider it my business to indicate approval or disapproval to anyone for the appearance of their body but since you asked, I think it looks unattractive. But I know other people aren‚Äôt on this earth to decorate it for me so I think they should all do as they please."
341,"Well I got a job ad FDA 13 years ago. Never did horrible but never did great either. One of our coworkers went on Maternity leave and I covered for them in the Budget Department.  And it just clicked. I dont do great with analysis,  but am great with numbers and answers. Got married and har 2 kids and love it there. It also helps that my boss is amazing!"

344,"I‚Äôm going to counselling. I‚Äôve had a really rough time and hit what I hope is my lowest point. No one in my life has any idea. So I made the choice completely on my own to seek help and start turning my life around. It‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôve ever done completely for myself and completely by myself. It might be a stupid thing to be proud of, but it feels really good to know I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm taking active steps to improve myself and my quality of life, not for anyone else, just for me."

347,"Really? Maybe this is just my friend group, but the bi and gay girls have had just as much appalling shit done to them by female partners as I have by men."
348,"Thankfully my brother and sister-in-law each have a switch. So there is never a dull moment, lol. Recently I was sick and was not able to leave the house. So my sister-in-law brought her switch and everyone came over (with a warning they risked getting sick, lol). We played Mario Party and Smash Bros. It was very fun!"

351,"Whenever I approach it‚Äôs usually to say hey, etc. It‚Äôs hard for me since I feel super shy/sometimes anxious to approach.

But the few times I have, it was successful.

Even though some were embarrassing at first, like not being able to recall how I know the person, but without thinking I said ‚Äúhey remember me? I feel like I know you.‚Äù 

I count these as successful because it didn‚Äôt harm me to approach if that makes sense, as I make it out to be in my head."

354,"No. Only if I'm cold. They do it they get stimulated, but that stimulation could be getting punched in the boob or being licked. Same physical response. I have basically zero sensation in my breasts."
355,"I am a single mom. My ex husband has no job so there is no child support. I pay for everything for my 3 kids- the house we live in, food, bills, activities, etc. 

I worked 2 jobs for a long time to make ends meet and while doing that, I finished my bachelors degree, became certified in my specialty, and finished my master's degree. I'm making way more than I was a few years ago and can afford more and more for me and my kids. 

I am so proud of the choices I made so that I can provide for myself and my children. If their dad ever does decide to get a job and pay child support, it will be bonus money that I can put into savings for them. "
356, What  useless contribution. 
357,I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm alive. Went through a suicide attempt in September. Still recovering and looking for another job but managed to just get approved today for an apartment with help from my dad to get away from my insane neighbors at my house.

Weight loss is such a tricky subject so I never talk about it but changing my diet and my life to be better for me has been really damn hard and I'm proud. 

Great post OP 10/10."
359,"Similar thing for me! My first year of uni I was incredibly depressed - my GPA was a solid 2.5 (out of 9.0 - I‚Äôm in New Zealand). I dropped out, spent five years sorting out my mental health, and went back. After three years studying part time my GPA is now sitting at 7.57 - I‚Äôm hoping to get it to an 8.0 at least before I graduate. "
360,I am learning to be a furniture maker. There are only men in my class and at jobs (women  are mostly looked down on) but at every internship i got a job offer and even at school i was asked to be a teaching assistent. I am doing exams now and teaching first years. 
361,"No, I‚Äôll just wait. I think it‚Äôs kind of rude to use the men‚Äôs. 

Ideally we would get rid of gendered bathrooms and then it wouldn‚Äôt matter. "

363,"Parents who told me to think of people in worse situations, like starving African kids or refugees in war torn countries. Other people‚Äôs issues do not invalidate your feelings and when you‚Äôre depressed or anxious, you shouldn‚Äôt have to feel guilty over something you can‚Äôt control"
364,"I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering, and now I'm getting an MS in Forestry. I feel the same sort of consistency-- the subjects are very different, but there are definitely transferable bits :)"
365,"Hi, former doormat here...  I broke up with a user boyfriend of 8 years in May,  I just entered the dating world a few short months ago.  I am no longer ignoring the red flags that I used to make excuses for and forgive quite easily out of fear that I would be alone for the rest of my life.   I am nipping that bullshit in the bud right away rather than wasting any more years of my life.... and calling everyone of these liars, players and (literally) criminals on their BS and cutting communication.   I realized that I have to protect myself as fiercely as I would my own child and have to quit wasting precious time giving men the benefit of the doubt who do not deserve it.   "
366,"I purchased a class A RV that I‚Äôm currently renovating to live in as a tiny home. So I own a home as a 25 year old. I don‚Äôt tell a lot of people because I don‚Äôt want to hear how it doesn‚Äôt count as home ownership. 

Oh I can tie a knot in a cherry stem with my mouth... still think that‚Äôs cool. "
367,"A minute of continued eye contact without blinking. Normally by that point I‚Äôm either wondering if something is off about my appearance that day, someone is starting a staring match with me, or someone is challenging me to a Pok√©mon battle."
368,Food. It almost always helps at least a little bit.
369,I'm inheriting the role and supervisor position of a coworker who's at a higher level than me but leaving the company. The team picked me over my other two counterparts who have equal experience and knowledge to take over this vacant position. I'm only 2 years out of college so I feel a little overwhelmed and honored that I'm taking the job of someone who has over double the experience I do.
370,[removed]
371,"Oh I'm sure, but I'd take a mountain of horse shit every day if it meant no suburbs."
372,"I agree, lots of the advice I've gotten over the years is very conflicting, especially the career advice. I mean, how am I supposed to maintain a clear, professional boundary while also making sure to be ""approachable"" to my male peers so they don't think I'm a bitch, but also be direct with those I'm giving directions to for their jobs, but also make sure to be polite and make it a request, not an order, so they don't think I'm uppity???

I literally was once advised that some men culturally aren't used to taking orders from a woman, so I sure always try to make sure and approach them respectfully and ask nicely instead of giving a directive, so as to be sensitive to their needs and not offend them. I'm sorry, what? If I'm the boss, that means that someone who outranks all of us put me in charge of these men. Why am I now tasked with making sure they're not uncomfortable with it? As long as I am being a fair and even-handed professional, they shouldn't expect to be treated differently by me than a male superior just because of what they're like outside of work. Are they going to stop interrupting me and talking down to me as if I don't know more than them and literally just finished training them on the task they're doing? Long story short, I ignored that advice, and while some of my male coworkers may not like me, they all respect me, and don't try that crap anymore.

And I was also told not to go out at night to the store! Also, don't have a first floor apartment, don't talk to people online, don't date anyone you meet online, never wear headphones outside, and so much more. I have broken all of those rules at one point or another, and nothing bad happened. I don't like that women are given these huge lists of so-called responsibilities whereas men are generally told the exact opposite. I hate that the onus of discomfort is traditionally on women."

376,I'm a student but I have to work in order to pay my bills I was very unhappy on my last work because it was literally hell I felt so worry because I needed the money but at the same time I was very insecure about being able to get another one and about not being good enough but I did it I got a nice job and I haven't finish my career but I already have (almost) a year of experience and actually I discovered that all my  doubts were in vain because I'm actually good at my job 
377,Right? Maybe they‚Äôre oblivious to it
378,"Most of it was BS and sexist shit or really advice that doesn't really do anything but a false sense of safety through safety theatrics. I shrug it off and go my own way. It's never from someone who's thoughtful, knows me and I wanted a perspective from. It's always unsolicited advice so the other person feels like they're ""helping""."
379,"I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bc girls have quizzes we have to take identifying male and female genitalia for a  grade while getting zero information and dudes just shoot the shit during sex ex. 

I know what a vas deferens does but there are a shocking amount of men out there that think women pee out of their vaginas. 

I know about their stupid vas deferens but locating a cervix on a diagram would flummox them. They don‚Äôt know how ladies bodies work and that‚Äôs on them.  "
380,"Sex is universal. Menstruation isn't. twit

Lots of women won't find it funny, and lots of men know jack shit about it to joke without sounding like a frigging ignorant twit. "
381,"You respect yourself and other people (including service workers!) and for fuck‚Äôs sake, you don‚Äôt spit in public."
382,"Its not uncomfortable. They knows what they want and it‚Äôs not just sex. 

It‚Äôs uncomfortable for you bc you really want to raw dog anything available and then leave. Unfortunately for you, other people have feelings and desires so you can‚Äôt just say anything you don‚Äôt want is someone ‚Äústill feeling uncomfortable‚Äù"
383,"Bro: ""I banged 4 girls this week!""
Dudes: ""you stud!""
Woman: ""I banged 4 dudes this week""
The whole dammed world: ""slut""
Utter nonsense. "
384,"Yes. Be honest from the start so we don‚Äôt both waste our time. It‚Äôll be uncomfortable, but the important thing is to be respectful afterwards. That‚Äôs it. Be honest, and then don‚Äôt be rude after we establish that we don‚Äôt want the same thing. "
385,"Well isn't this some anti male, feminist wanna be bull shit comment. Probably because I've never heard one funny Menstration joke ever. One want to hear a joke? A funny female comedian... The end"
386,Wow what a wild story. I honestly would have been like you are not what I was expecting and you are creeping me out. You need to go. Uber back. Byeee

389,"Hey, I'm very interested in learning Finnish! There is a reddit user who created a ""Finnish for English speakers"" course (which you can find on YouTube in the channel ""excited about learning"", if you want to check it out). It's not finished, but I think he has a great understanding of the way the language works, and it really shows. 


Can you give me some general recommendations or point me to some resources which you have found helpful? 


Also, I'm not sure if you know about it, but there is a site called LanguageTransfer, which is run by a linguist named Mihalis. He creates courses for many different languages which follow a very natural way of learning. If you are interested in any of the languages that he teaches, you should definitely check it out."
390,"In my experience, creepy people stay creepy.

Most of the time (but not always), I know I'm physically attracted to someone within seconds of seeing/meeting them. Creepiness is usually more behavior/body language based so tyically takes longer to register someone as creepy.

Basically that means by the time I've interacted with someone enough to feel creeped out by them, I've already determined whether I have physical attraction for them and after being creeped out that attraction goes out the window. "
391,"Thanks! Some suggestions I've heard are phrases like: ""I'm not looking for anything serious right now."" ""I'm not interested in a commitment,"" ""I'm just in this for a little fun if you are,"" ""Just a warning- I'm not looking for a relationship at the moment."" Do these feel okay for you?"
392,"Cool! You must see a lot of offices that way. Ours is open with everyone's desks close, like a giant computer lab but 3x the monitors and larger desks. I always wonder how many offices do the cubicle thing you see in movies. Visit any of those? Our company is also 20-40 ppl kind of small. At bigger companies (300+ ppl) who do the same thing as us they're a little more split. So instead of the whole office being friends they'll be friends like that only with the ppl in their dependents (which is that same 20-40ppl groups)."
393,Thank you very much!

396,Cookies and donuts! Cause I‚Äôm fat haha
397,You are wasting your life
398,"For most of my life, people have been telling me to be less nice, to be more tough, that if I don't people will just walk all over me.  But I've found that it isn't really true.

There's a difference between conflict averse and being nice.  Being nice involves taking action to be kind to those around you.  Not sitting scared while you let others do what they want.  And there's a huge difference.  When you're aggressively nice, people leap to your side the moment you have a mean thing to say about anyone.  They believe you when you have something critical to say.  Just this past week, my team was leaping to fix a build server for fear that I might say something scathing like ""Guys I really appreciate all the work you've been doing on your other projects, but can you please prioritize the build server right now?  It's very important.""

I negotiated a 23% raise by talking about how much I love my company and want to work there forever, and that's why it's important that as my city grows in prosperity my salary stays competitive.

My whole life, men have told me that in order to be successful I need to stop being so golly gosh darn nice all the time, because people will walk all over me.  Turns out you don't have to stop being nice.  You just have to not let people walk all over you."

406,"I broke my back last May in a car accident and had to get reconstructive spinal surgery. It's been 7 months and I went back to college in that time, got 2 B's and an A, was relearning how to walk and doing physical and EMDR therapy AND working during this time. I've finally reached a point where I'm constantly not in pain (unless I stand for too long or sit in an uncomfortable chair for long) or stressed about commuting to class because I'm taking online classes.

I feel incredible compared to just a month ago, and I've applied to a job in a law office that I hope to get. My relationship is the best it's ever been and I'm feeling very emotionally stable. My year is starting off pretty good!"

421,"Pretty much everyone is casual friends with everyone else. While working we're all silent at desks but still chat and send gifs over the office chat system. Each morning we have dailies in the screening room together. On top of giving notes on submitted work we crack jokes, chat while things load, or sometimes make fun of the ridiculous things directors and producers ask of us. We have lunch together in small groups and do a larger one on Fridays. Most of us take the train home so we leave the office and walk to the station together."
422,"This is easy if you meet online.
I can't quite imagine doing it in real life. "
423,"At the end of my previous relationship, there was an event that threw us into 5 months of instability and anxiety and tension before we finally broke things off. Just after the event, I tried multiple times to get him to talk to me about how he was feeling/what was going through his mind/encourage him to talk to me so we could work through the problem. After a week of that, exasperated, I told him I understood he needed some time and would leave it up to him to come to me when he was ready to talk. But he never did and our relationship deteriorated from there over the course of 5 months. During our breakup, he said ""I'm sorry, I know I could've communicated better""

and I just said ""It's okay"". 

I will always regret saying that because it wasn't okay. The way he handled it was very not okay and it destroyed a really great relationship. I had awful, awful anxiety about it during that time and those months were agony but I waited desperately hoping for him to come around.

I hate that I let him off the hook. That I didn't say ""I accept your apology, but I wish things could've been different"". Or ""Thank you for acknowledging that"". That's all I would've changed, but instead even in the end I allowed myself to be a doormat and I regret that."
424,"I had a guy tell me I hurt his feelings by not telling him he had a big dick, and he guessed I must have seen some extra large ones if I was not impressed with his, because all the other women he had been with said it was huge.  
I kind of froze, because while it was a really nice penis (Very, Very nice. He did great work with it too), it really was not big, and I really liked him so I did not want to hurt him.  
So I blurted out, ""The only girls I know that rave about big penises are sluts, and I did not want you to think I was a slut, so I kept it to myself!""  
That lie was bigger than his penis, and I felt terrible about the line about sluts, but I really liked the guy. And it made him feel like a master of the universe, without me having to actually say it was big."
425,"I feel like this is unwarentedly aggresive. I do not want to *""want to raw dog anything available and then leave.""*

First. Protection is very important to me, I'm not the animal you suggest I am simply for being a man. 

Second. Who said I'd leave immediately afterwards? Who even said it wouldn't be at my place?

Third.  Unfortunately for you, **I have feelings and desires** so **you** can‚Äôt just say things like this as if I am some evil, sexist. 

I was admiting to being ignorant and open to being educated. If you wanted to say ""it's not my business"" that would be fine i**f you where even the person I was talking to.** 

I love this thread, I have learned so many thing I was doing wrong. I do not love snakes like you that make me feel inferior just for being ignorant. I understand that things I say or do **may be sexist.** I am here simply to learn. Please go away if you are going to continue to hate me for this.

434,That‚Äôs a win in my book too!
435,"None. Everything was a learning experience or a good story.

I slept with someone once that I was absolutely not attracted to just because I thought ""this is going to be hilariously bad."" He took off his clothes and he had a Brazilian wax. Skinny landing strip following his snail trail and ending at the base of his penis. I nearly burst out laughing at how ridiculous it looked and the sex just got worse from there. I was so thrilled I committed to it, it made me laugh so hard for days afterwards."
436,I‚Äôve never been a bubbly person nor do I have the desire to.
437,"...yes. I also read but have no desire to become an author, cook but have no desire to take up farming, wear clothes but have no desire to weave cloth, listen to podcasts but have no desire to create them, get haircuts but have no desire to become a hairdresser, drink but have no desire to take up brewing beer."
438,"I just started back at university after 2.5 years away. My advisor told me to expect a significant GPA drop during my first semester back because I wouldn't be used to the level of coursework.  

So far I've taken 5 quizzes, turned in 2 homework assignments, and submitted part 1 of a project. I have gotten As on everything I've turned in, and all of it has been pretty extensive. 

I'm working my butt off. Studying every day. Finishing assignments early so I can get feedback before due dates. Connecting with classmates in case I have any questions.  Talking with my professors so to build relationships/trust. Going to office hours for any clarification I need. I even joined a club to get more involved.

My family doesn't understand that I'm working hard. I've always done pretty well in school, but this is a big adjustment and I'm having to work *really* hard. I can't brag to them, so I have to brag here."
439,"People have assumed that I'm conservative a lot, and they spout their rhetoric around me like  gonna agree with them. Maybe it's because I'm shy and quiet, I have no clue. They couldn't have been more wrong. "

442,"Ehhh. I don‚Äôt really regret any of the guys I‚Äôve slept with, I just don‚Äôt care. Still, I‚Äôd take back all three one-night stands because they were extremely boring and a waste of time. And I‚Äôd take back sleeping with two guys I reallllllly liked and thought they felt the same, only to find out they were just stringing me along. 

Actually, I‚Äôd take back all the guys I‚Äôve slept with I didn‚Äôt have a serious relationship with, because none of them were good experiences really. Not necessarily awful or anything, but none of them brought anything positive to my life. So seven out of 10. "
443,Lol well I got rejected but still had class and lab with her everyday. Yes it was kinda awkward for a semester. But things eventually improved and now we are closer friends then before. Guess I‚Äôm a rare case. 
444,So . . . Are you lactose intolerant?
445,"Stifling their imagination or creativity. I hate watching kids who are naturally curious about things, like wanting to help in the kitchen, and getting their hands slapped for almost making a mess. I get that parenthood is hard and parents can get snappy, but I know some kids who have parents who seem perpetually like this. Makes me really sad when kids can't express themselves or aren't encouraged to learn."

Also, congratulations for Finnish. I like the way it sounds, but it's sooo different from anything else! "
449,"I was 20 or so. 

And when I mentioned going to see my semi-boyfriend, I used his actual name, not his relationship to me. The three of us had gone to high school together, and the semi-boyfriend was my on-again-off-again high school sweetheart. My guy friend had always been my friend - we were in a ton of the same classes and did some extracurricular activities after school together."
450,"Shaving

I'm 15, have no partner and always wear stuff that covers my legs and arms. But my mom always brings up the fact I don't see any point in shaving as proof I'm 'lazy'. She also doesn't seem to get the fact that asking me to shave and not my step brother is a double standard."
451,"Mom of a recently diagnosed child with ADHD. Any helpful tips, words of wisdom to help us out.  Child is 9. "
452,Love this 
453,I preferred online as well. If someone couldn't hold the convo it was easy to peace out of a chat than go through the trouble of a date with a stranger you met in passing or got set up with you know nothing about. If we met in person we talked well enough online/phone to know we click and won't be as awkward. 
454,"My husband is 30 days sober!! It was rough last year and we almost separated a few times because of drinking/drugs. 
But I stuck it out, he‚Äôs really commited to his sobriety. I‚Äôm proud of him and we‚Äôre taking it one day at a time. "
455,I have nice eyes and eyeliner really brings them out. But I didn‚Äôt get the hang of it until last year (I‚Äôm 31 LOL). It definitely got a lot of attention when I started using it because I never had before.
