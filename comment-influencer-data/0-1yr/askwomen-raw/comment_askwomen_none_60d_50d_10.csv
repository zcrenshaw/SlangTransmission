0,"I was safe, well-fed, well-educated.  But I was also made very aware of my mistakes, taught not to think too highly of myself, and trained to think of myself as just a bit disappointing."
1,"I like amateur porn. I can‚Äôt stand the fake, moaning stuff or stuff where it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs for a porn site and the camera is up in the females face.

I like lesbian porn or gay porn. I rarely watch straight porn unless the guy is focusing on the female and it‚Äôs not just blowjobs"
2,"Still fowl, but less objectionable"
3,Julie Andrews in every way üíï
4,"Not understanding women are people.  Thinking Instagram models or porn stars (i.e., the act they put on as part of their jobs) are representative of how women really act.  Thinking if they're nice to a woman and she owes sex in return.  Thinking women don't have feelings or can't have certain common personality traits or opinions but share one hive mind.  Thinking women don't have ""real"" problems."
5,"Everything about discharge. And it will bleach your pants, and that‚Äôs normal."
6,I had nearly nonexistent libido for over a year postpardum but I still wanted to have that relationship with my SO.  I communicated with my SO about my needs and we found that reallyyyyy sllooowwww foreplay with the ticket.  Like gentle kisses and words of affirmation hour  before any clothes come off.  That kind of slow.  The slowness gave my brain and body time to get into the mood.
7,"I just started back. My new therapist is a freakin genius. My parents were ‚Äúenmeshed‚Äù with us (their kids). We had to be just like them or the didn‚Äôt accept us. 

Separately, I was talking about how absorb the moods of my husband and children. It‚Äôs damn near impossible for me to be happy if even one of them is in a bad mood (do you know how often preteen children are in a bad mood?!?!). She said ‚Äúnow don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but isn‚Äôt that just like your parents? Everyone has to be perfectly content and happy, for you to be happy...

They do not have to be ok, for you to be ok.‚Äù 

Life. Changing. It was one of those moments where time slows down, because you can finally see through the fog. My husband can be in a bad mood because of work, or whatever and I CAN be ok. My preteen son and be a moody kid, and I can be ok. It‚Äôs like she gave me permission. It was only two weeks ago that she said this, and I can see it transforming my relationships."
8,"Guys who don't see or support their kids. They have a baby or two with one girl, break up, ghost the kids and go on to repeat it with someone else."
9,"Duck pics?

sign me tf up 

I love those quacky guys"
10,"Not current relationship, but about 4 years ago I had been with my boyfriend for ~2 years and often I felt taken for granted but I always stayed because he would cry and beg and pleased and promise to ‚Äúbe better‚Äù. 

The final nail in the coffin for me was Christmas, when we had promised to hand-make each other‚Äôs gifts because he was in a poor financial position. I love handmade stuff so I was happy to oblige even though I could have easily bought something. 

I made him this 200 page scrapbook, where each page was a page dedicated to a friend, or family member, or neighbour, each with a reason why they were happy they knew him and/or their favourite memory with him. It was literally bursting with reasons why he was valued and why he mattered and I put my heart, soul, and hours upon hours of time into it. 

He bought me slippers a size too small, on Christmas Eve. 

When I reminded him we said handmade gifts, he said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have time‚Äù. 

We stayed together for about ~4 more months but that was the moment it was over in my head and when he finally ‚Äúlet‚Äù me leave him, I didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt cry over the breakup at all."
11,When you are mocked more than you are supported. That you are mocked at all. When you are called derogatory names during an argument.
12,"Malala Yousafzai. Literally shot in the head, but has never acted with hate or negativity (even though that would be totally justifiably). Instead she has been a tireless advocate for women and girls and is such a pure, sweet soul."
13,I knew twins who were called Unique... and Antique.
14,I watch all different kinds but the one thing I absolutely cannot stand is when the woman is making super loud and ridiculous sounds.
15,"That women get hair everywhere. Even the typical ‚Äòmanly‚Äô areas, like mustache, belly, toes, etc. I‚Äôve seen some less hairy women surprised at this.. they‚Äôre surprised a women gets hair there, cause they personally don‚Äôt. Most women are so shaved, waxed and lasered down now a days that it can be quite eye opening for some to see any hair."
16,"See [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net) or  [https://archiveofourown.org/](https://archiveofourown.org/)  that is what a lot of it would look like. To spare you the time: more story, more foreplay, more ""love"" (cuddling etc.), more eye contact. However, the tastes vary greatly as you can also see when you look at the stories from the provided links."
17,"Men who are only friendly to (typically) gorgeous women, and rude to the rest. To these types of guys, women are nothing but their looks; they aren‚Äôt interesting or funny, don‚Äôt have personalities and aren‚Äôt very smart. That pisses me off each time."
18,That we can‚Äôt hold and release period blood at will. It just comes out of its own accord.
19,"You might be interested in reading a book called Come As You Are, by Emily Nagoski, which talks about identifying desire accelerators and brakes.  It's a great book."
20,"When I started to go to therapy and was able to finally put my finger on what I needed from a relationship.   I had candid conversations with my H about my needs, and for awhile he'd say he'd ""work on it""  but then nothing changed.  Finally he said that he just couldn't do it and it wasn't fair for me to ask him to change.  (I was asking for things like emotional intimacy, and him listening to me when I talked - that sort of thing)   So it was that moment when I knew I could either stay in a comfortable safe thing and just not have those needs met or I could blow up my life to try to find actual romantic connection.  I'm blowing up my life."
21,"It‚Äôs generally everything including any hairs on your ass lol. You are naked from the waist down and the waxer gets in every single crevice - including having you bring your knees to your chest for certain parts. 

It‚Äôs awkward as hell but you feel amazing for about a week afterwards and waxers look at vaginas all day everyday anyway so meh."
22,"When you or the other person start to believe that you no longer need to:

* Say please / thank you to each other - even for small things that you could easily grow to expect from the other. Like taking out the trash, or running to the grocery store, or changing out the toilet paper roll. Definitely say thank you for the big stuff and the stuff you couldn't have done yourself, at least as easily.
* Apologize for inappropriate behavior - A lot of unstable couples fall into a routine where they just let these outbursts slide by without addressing them. They get comfortable in their wallowing, venting, etc. A healthy relationship means actively working to recognize where you may have been wrong/irrational and/or hurt the other and admitting your fault without waiting for them to bring it up.
* Sacrifice - Relationships involve a certain amount of healthy sacrifice to remain in balance. Sure, you each should be your own person and you should do your best not to hold the other back from what they love or aspire towards, but a healthy relationship will continue to involve self-sacrifices that you choose to make for the betterment of the relationship or the other person. If you stop sacrificing and start counting every little loss as a personal defeat, you're being selfish and this leads to unhealthy problems and patterns.
* Say I Love You (or share your common affections) - It's not true that a word loses meaning if it's said too often. You should express your verbal affections as often as they're felt. If you can no longer bring yourself to express these affections consistently (or worse yet, you don't feel them at all) then the flame is dying.
* Compliment or Encourage one another - Along with the above, strive to remind your SO on a consistent basis of the things that you love about them. Compliment their looks, or brains, or cooking. Pinch their butt. All of that stuff that tells them that they are still active on your mind and of interest / importance to you. If this stops, the desire is also.
* Make each other feel good - It's simple. If you're thinking about them lovingly, you will likely want to do things that make them feel good. Buy them their favorite candy bar when you're at the store. Rub their feet or back for no reason. Massage their scalp. (Try to) cook them a really nice dinner. When these considerations stop, it's time to reassess.

I'm no expert, but these would be my signs that something is wrong and it's potentially time to walk away if they can't be fixed."
23,"I will literally power-skip through any blow jobs (which is at times, a third of the fucking video.)"
24,"I‚Äôve had a lot of luck using conditioner as my ‚Äòshaving cream‚Äô, using men‚Äôs razors and going with the grain not against"
25,I just want people to know we **do not** pee out of our vaginas. I feel like crying every time I hear a girl or women say that.
26,"I also prefer gay male porn for two main reasons: 1) it's incredibly offputting when I can tell the woman in straight porn isn't actually enjoying herself, which is far too often, and 2) I'm attracted to dudes. Gay porn has double the hot dude bod and dude sounds."
27,Lots of men for some reason think that they can just touch you
28,"HILARIOUS. I‚Äôm 100% Lao. One of two Asians in my predominantly white red neck high school. I was nicknamed China Vagina, Ling Ling, and Dragon Lady (movie reference.) It wasn‚Äôt excessive or overbearing so I didn‚Äôt care. I thought it was funny. It wasn‚Äôt to torture or harass me, just to kinda get my attention. 

So I married someone born in West Virginia. He hates the place. I went to his family reunion and was asked, ‚ÄúAre yew CHINESE or JAPANESE?‚Äù I died laughing, my husband was horrified. His grandma cut in WITH SO MUCH SASS and was like ‚ÄúUH, she‚Äôs ASIAN.‚Äù 

Hell yeah mamaw, you tell em‚Äô lmao"
29,"Real sex being had by real couples with real passion/amateur stuff, which preferably includes other things from this list...

Gay/lesbian
Women pegging men but not in a dominatrix way
Outdoors/chance of getting caught
Parties/groups
Loud male orgasms"
30,historically speaking i'm utterly useless and will believe we're ''friends'' up until the moment i'm grabbed and kissed.
31,Gaslighting/belittling/invalidating women's extremely valid fears based on how they themselves have subjectively experienced and existed in the world.
32,"THAT IF YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE STRAIGHT OR WAVY HAIR BUT IT'S JUST TOO FRIZZY... it may actually be curly hair. Look for the Curly Girl Method... that shit changed my life, trust me."
33,Lots of are you related to Jackie Chan?One time I was questioned if I was a mail order bride and then told it's okay if I was  because her brother has one and it's still okay. Thank God I moved
34,"Something that feels real, passionate, and emotive. Where both/all people involved are respected and treated like human beings, and are trying to make each other feel good. 

Also! **Vocal males**. I get so sick of hearing a woman faking noises, I want to hear real breaths, grunts, sighs of pleasure. Hearing a guy moaning is such a huge turn on."
35,"I have met a lot of men I could call trash. But the kind of men I've met that takes the prize for being the trashiest are the men who support gender equality and fights for women's rights when they themselves violate those rights. I've been in a relationship with a guy who sexually harassed me. Before all the drama happened, he was always talking about how women should be respected as much as men and that men shouldn't complain when they're being called trash. So trashy I wish I never met him."
36,"It isn't about fixing you. It is about acquiring the tools to change behaviors that you have either learned, inherited or developed as protection. This is the one place in the world you need to be honest with your therapist and yourself. Face the hard stuff. Also, if you aren't improving in therapy, and are working on yourself honestly, maybe the therapist isn't right for you. I had to shop around to find one that didn't tell me to hand my problems to a higher power. Being an atheist, I am the higher power."
37,"With hair, less is more. I used to wash, shampoo, condition, tower / blowdry, comb and brush daily. Nowadays, I wash and use a shampoo / conditioner about every three days, air dry and brush it not too often, and get tons of compliments on my hair. People always ask what I do with it, what products I use, etc, and are always surprised when I tell them how little I actually do."
38,"Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek: Original Series)

She's the Goddess of STEM inspiration and representation."
39,"I started getting a Brazilian wax once a month and I'll NEVER shave again. So worth it! Also boosts my confidence in bed. I use an exfoliating Mitt a couple of days after the wax, and each time I shower and gently rub in circular motions to get the hair to come up off my skin and not downward as it starts to grow back. Havent had an issue in the 4 months I've been doing it. Also when I dry off I pat, not rub or drag the towel."
40,"Since r/abrathatfits has been mentioned, I wish women better understood their periods and what is or isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

I had NO IDEA that saturating 18 ultra absorbency tampons and 5-8 maximum strength maxi pads wasn‚Äôt normal. 

*Years* of three days of being functionally useless due to spending 10 minutes in the bathroom every hour or so and chewing through countless Motrin, aleve, midol, and so on every month is completely not normal.  Even half of that is not normal. 

If you have heavy cycles and access to health care - please find a doctor who will listen to you and *help* you."
41,"I'm white, but a good friend of mine from high school is Mexican American and has dark skin. A lot of people would call him black and Indian because of it. He also was overweight whch made him a target for a lot of bullying even in our friend group (a lot of our ""friends"" were just assholes). He heard a lot if jokes about fried chicken and watermelon. And it was known that his family used the local food bank for some help with groceries and all the rich, white, rancher kids would point out how poor he was and say things like, ""Does food stamps pay for that?"" when mentioning he needed to buy something. He worked his butt off though for a local restaurant and ended up buying his own truck and even graduated high school a year early and just graduated college. He also made much better friends and we still keep in touch."
42,The oxygen mask concept. Basically you have to put on your own ‚Äúmask‚Äù first by improving your mental health and doing what‚Äôs best for you before you can assist others and help them with their lives. Really made me take a step back from getting involved in other people‚Äôs problems because it wouldn‚Äôt benefit me or my health.
43,"It would look like the millions and millions of fanfiction stories that already exist written by women for other women, about gay men."
44,"those who post violent things about women on the internet because they don't like how we act. (i.e. the world was better when i could cheat/ be violent towards you &amp; it was more difficult for you to divorce me, now independent women are xy&amp;z so i'm gonna continue to be violent). 

of course all men aren't trash &amp; if they're not referring to you then you'll know. it's just an expression towards the sexist ones."
45,"""I am a relic, and I have misplaced my tambourine"""
46,"The pragmatism of relationships. Do you know why we nag about the housework? Not because we are hormonal or frustrated with our life path. We don't want to do it either. But we do it because it needs to be done, just do the frickin' dishes."
47,Your labia do not change size depending on the number of sexual partners you have had!
48,I had a friend named Scrap. Always thought it was a nickname until we became friends and that‚Äôs his birth name and I‚Äôm just like whyyy? Scrap??
49,"Wow- for what its worth, that is an incredibly thoughtful gift"
50,Being rude to cashiers or customer service staff jokingly with their friends.
51,"They definitely meant that I had a history of choosing partners who didn't treat me well. More specifically, partners who tried to control me, tell me who I could see when, etc. My friends were ABSOLUTELY right."
52,"separate anxious thoughts from reality. Instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a terrible person‚Äù say, ‚ÄúI am having a thought that I am a terrible person.‚Äù"
53,"An African or a European swallow probably, they can carry so much weight"
54,"Not smiling in photos / trying to look ‚Äútough‚Äù in photos. I like when a guy‚Äôs social media has pics of him smiling, looking genuine and approachable. Shirtless mirror selfies and lifeless expressions on faces are a little off-putting to me."
55,"I HATED being a girl as a teenager because I'm a bleacher and I had absolutely no clue that it was a normal thing.

I read so many times in magazines that clear or slightly cloudy/white discharge was normal. Bleachy discharge was something that I never, ever read about or heard about so of course teenage me just thought I was totally abnormal."
56,"This presumption was raised within a group of dorm friends and a particular no-nonsense female shut it down quick with this response, 

‚ÄúIf we could squeeze our [vaginas] closed with enough force to hold back the flow, we could also crush your dick like a walnut. Have any of you had your dick crushed like a walnut?‚Äù

It‚Äôs been 27 years since I heard that and I still remember the quiet stillness in the air as a group of college male freshmen simultaneously digested that counterpoint. None of us had a response for her."
57,"One day, my ex was really annoyed at me and in a very sad way of trying to shut me up, he said something that I used to hear when I got bullied in school. He knew what he was saying and still went for it. I never felt so hurt and betrayed as I felt in that moment. Clearly our relationship was going down the drain, not even one month after that, we broke up."
58,"As a guy I really like a variety of different things. If I‚Äôm feeling:

- Intimate: One hand at the lower back of my head with rubs and scratches. It alleviates a ton of stress and a woman can both lower my blood pressure and make my heart race at the same time doing this. 

- Very aroused: Nails grazing the skin on my arms. I typically wear button downs or long sleeves and roll them up. 

- Cherishing: Running hand up and down my upper chest and another reaching to the back of my neck. Then we basically just breathe each other in in-between kisses. 

- She needs me: Hands on my back with nails starting to claw at me. 

It also depends on where we are: bed, standing up in her apartment or mine, etc. I‚Äôm legally blind and when I am in a relationship of some sort the woman I‚Äôm with knows that the way to really get me is through touch. Generally speaking, men REALLY like touch as long as you‚Äôre clear about what you want in that moment."
59,They quack me up!
60, Guys who also shit on women wearing sexy outfits in public but also think the same types are hot otherwise. Bruh...
61,"When we told my FIL we were having a girl,  the first words out of his mouth were,  ""Well you can try again.""  That was over 10 years ago, and it instantly came to mind when I read this question."
62,When I found out he was cheating and I didn't care.
63,"We need height info! If it's still *outside* your house, and still casual, I vote start with arm biceps and pecs. Not too intercoursey but still lusty/romantic. Opposed to back of neck grab, if he's taller bc he has to stoop to your touch. Nothing under the clothes while outside if you can help it lol"
64,"Like: they asked for and respected my opinions (but without giving them more weight than they deserved).  The told me they liked my personality.  They told me what they admired about me.  The enjoyed my company and told me so.  I think that all this together is what makes my self-esteem so healthy.

Dislike: they didn't push me to persevere.  When activities were challenging, I just quit, and they let me.  I wish they'd pushed me more so that I developed some talents and skills."
65,"I legit had to teach this to an ex. 

He didn't understand tampons and pads. He said ""why can't you just hold it"" like that had never occurred to any women or animal in history"
66,"I don‚Äôt have to try to attack every negative feeling. Sometimes it‚Äôs okay to just be like ‚Äúoh, hey sadness, I see ya‚Äù or ‚Äúoh, alright panic, run your course while I finish doing what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù 

Acceptance therapy was the most powerful thing I ever did. 

CBT, self-talk... it made me worse. Learning to just acknowledge the emotion and move on with my life was life-changing."
67,"Some 6ft something guy: ""Why don't you just tell catcallers to fuck off?""
Me: oh gee :) why :) didn't I :) think :) of :) that? :)"
68,"I resent that I wasn't raised with any sense of healthy eating or moderation. My parents let me eat ice cream and sweets every day and didn't often cook vegetables - I distinctly remember the first time I had salad and baby carrots because I was like 7 years old. As a result I was obese during childhood (I weigh the same at 21 as I did when I was 11) and am in the process of forming new habits and trying to lose weight. 

I genuinely feel I wouldn't have hated myself as much if my parents had 1) taught me good habits from the start and 2) helped me lose weight instead of getting mad at my doctors."
69,I know two little boys (brothers) named Slayden and Stryker. I'm sure there's worse out there but these names really bother me for some reason. Maybe it's the kids lol.
70,"When I realized that I didn't really like him very much anymore. At one point, I came to the realization that if I'd met him right then we probably wouldn't even be friends, let alone a couple."
71,"That's funny, because my first thought upon reading this topic was also ""it would be slash fanfiction""."
72,I‚Äôm actually really surprised at how many people think this is the case. I had a kidney stone and was told by my guy friend that it ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt hurt as bad‚Äù because my vagina is bigger than his pee hole. Oof.
73,"How bra sizes work, and how bras should fit. I feel like am met with utter disbelief if I share my size (30F/32DD depending on brand) because I look like a ‚Äúconventional‚Äù C. Bra sizes go up to K+, it‚Äôs just that most big box stores cap out at DD-DDD max. So women with the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù boobs squish into a band too big and a cup too small. Women and men compare down from that example. The brathatfits sub is amazing. You commonly see women go from like 34C to 30G or 36A to 32D etc. I highly recommend checking it out and using their bra size calculator."
74,My mom shamed me about that and kept saying I needed to purify my thoughts and pray to God for it to stop
75,[removed]
76,Bondage: preferably involving tease and denial with a vibrator or asking for permission to cum and being denied for a long time. Unfortunately it's really challenging to find videos that fit this category at times.
77,"One question: As I see so many ... *strange* names here - how are parents allowed to do this to their kids?

In Germany, the clerk at the civil registry office will refuse any name that is deemed harmful to the child (source of mockery, no common name). They also require certified statements from academia to confirm that the names are legit, when they want to give not-so-common, dialect and/or mostly forgotten surnames."
78,"I LOVED it! My husband was also 100% about it and loved that I didn‚Äôt suffocate him anymore when we were snuggling! 

However, every other man in my life felt the need to tell me how they could never be with a girl that had short hair like mine and that got old real quick!!!"

Julia Child is the most wholesome badass woman. She was an amazing chef, a loving wife, a fantastic author, and a secret spy during WW2. Here's some other interesting facts about her:

* She was the first woman inducted into the Culinary Institute of America‚Äôs Hall of Fame.
* She lived to be 92 and attributed her long life to red meat and gin.
* She was 6‚Äô 2‚Äù tall.
* She was the first educational TV personality to win an Emmy.

91,I just engage. And give myself time to feel in the mood. I've sometimes watched porn or read literotica before engaging. I will tell them I need quite a bit of foreplay. I also encourage having a partner who doesn't get bitter that after foreplay. You're still not in the mood.
92,"Lifting weights will not make you ‚Äúbulky like a man‚Äù. There are women who are athletes who lift weights for the purposes of having a particular physique, but if you‚Äôre just doing it to keep fit and exercise, lifting weights will not bulk you. Also, wth does ‚Äútone up/down‚Äù mean?"
93,"My husband and I had a very difficult time previously in our relationship and we were bothing looking for ways out. Ultimately, we decided the only reason we were looking for the out was because we weren‚Äôt communicating nor acting as a couple. We sat down and pushed through the hard time, doing what we can to prove to each other not only that we still loved each other but that we still wanted to be with one another.

I‚Äôve not kept tabs on the bad time, but know it was a while ago. 

Right now, we are cuddling in bed, watching movies and enjoying a laugh with our two children coming up randomly to give us kisses. If we went through with divorce, I would have missed out on some of my most treasured family moments.  It worked out for us because we wanted it to work out. 

I‚Äôm... WE are happy."
94,"I already prefer this. While I am attracted to women also (I'm bi), I enjoy the penis ratios in gay male porn, and the fact that they are generally nice to each other (no slapping or spitting which can occur in ""straight porn"". It's quite common for women to watch."

98,"***EVERYTHING.***

Until I was 28, I've lived with at least 1 other person since I was born, usually living with more than 3 others.

Living on my own is *so wonderful*. I don't think I'll ever be able to live with someone else again üò¨

It's quiet unless I want it loud, I get to control the thermostat at all times, I decide how to decorate, I keep it as clean as possible and I don't have to worry about random messes from someone else, I know exactly where that thing is cuz it's right where I left it 3 weeks ago, nobody but me eats the last toaster strudel, I can do whatever I want whenever I want, I can be naked 100% of the time if I want, nobody is there to teach my dog bad manners, I can relax whenever I want, I don't ever feel obligated to talk to someone, I can come home from work and just unwind on my own.

Fuuuuuck! Living alone is the cat's pajamas!"
99,"Not a woman, but discussed this with my wife extensively at the time when she went through an extended low libido episode, and just now to confirm that this is accurate and that it's ok to post online. (She's not a reddit user.)

Before I say anything, this definitely would not work for many women, especially those with significantly different personality types to my wife.

For her the main trick was agreeing to schedule sex in advance. She's a natural planner, a very scheduled person, and doesn't really like surprises. So when she found herself still experiencing a low libido a year after our second was born, we agreed to schedule sex for twice a week. For her it really worked. She knew to expect it, so she would mentally sort of organize her day knowing it was going to happen so that we weren't caught up with chores or whatever by the evening (I would do the same obviously). She would also make a point to think about all the things she liked about sex and give herself a chance to look forward to it in a way that would really help her get into the mood.

Once we actually got started, we would go slow and help her work herself into the mood even more, and things would usually go well.

What I also learned from that though was that if I want to proposition her on a particular day, the best time to do it is earlier in the day. Giving her a chance to mentally get herself ready and in the mood increases her pleasure and excitement, and helps us make sure we're preemptively addressing anything that might distract or stress her out. It really helped us get back on track, and we don't stick to the schedule so much any more because we don't need to. Our libidos still don't perfectly match, but we're both in a happy place where she's having sex a little more often than her normal level of desire would really warrant, but still within her comfort zone, and I'm having a little less sex that I'd really be prefer, but I'm not serially sexually frustrated either. It's no longer me initiating all the time, and we're both in a better place for that part of our relationship. Most importantly, she feels understood and not pressured, which is something she needs, and I feel wanted and desired which is something I need."

Your orgasms can also be better if you listen to what your body is telling you to do (no matter how awkward and silly you may think you look). Are your hips wanting to tilt that way? Do it. Are you wanting to grind up into your partner? Do it. Let go of what you look like.  
(Consent is obviously assumed)"
114,"I like a story, I need a reason why these two people are having sex. It doesn't have to be convoluted or anything, sometimes just a couple outfits with barely any dialog is enough. Two people having sex just because they want to rarely interests me."

116,"I definitely have work anxiety. Just the thought that I have to wake up every morning for 5 days a week and stay here for 9 hours with only 2 weeks of holiday makes me anxious when I think about my future. It just seems like a wasted life. But I need to pay rent so, I have literally no other choice. It's life and it sucks."
117,Using hair conditioner instead of shaving cream has been a game changer for me. I have keratosis pilaris so shaving my legs with a razor was a no no. I got so tired of the pain of pulling the hair until I tried it. Much faster and no irritation whatsoever.
118,"Women. So many men come to this community trying to get us to interpret some SUPER SECRET SIGNALS that some woman is apparently giving, when they're not secret signals at all. They're just...things that living, breathing human beings do.

123,"My favourite reaction to body hair on women is when a teen/young women slams others for having body hair with the comment ""It's not natural."" I only shave my legs, armpits and bikini line. As such I have noticable (blonde) hair on my arms when you're close to me. I was having a coffee on one of my work lunch breaks a few months ago when some teens came in to the shop, sat next to me and started yaking about their purchases until one of them noticed my arms. ""Body hair on women is gross"" I heard one of them mutter to their friends. I didn't intervene but it's depressing to think girls as young as that are being conditioned to believe their bodies are gross even though things such as hair growth are 100% natural and healthy."
124,"Thank you! It took about 3 months to complete because I had to track down some of the people in his life, not to mention all the construction of it. I don‚Äôt regret making it, even though he may not have appreciated me for doing it."
125,"28 year old woman here-quite a few years ago I discovered I was into this, but an ex saw my browser history and shamed me endlessly for it. Jokes on him, I just recently found out lots of women like it!"
126,"I hate to say this, because I love guys and I‚Äôve always had guy friends. And when I was younger I would have defended guys to the death ‚Äòoh no! They‚Äôre not just after sex!‚Äô

BUT...

Now at 40 it‚Äôs really sinking in how guys really are just after sex. The lengths they‚Äôll go to. The platitudes, the lies. It‚Äôs really shitty to lead someone on in order to use them, knowing full well you have no intention of following through with anything you‚Äôre promising.

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt dream of sleeping with someone unless I somewhat like them. I can‚Äôt fucking believe how guys will stick their dicks in anyone they 1. Don‚Äôt respect 2. Aren‚Äôt attracted to 3. Aren‚Äôt interested in 4. Have no intention of seeing again 

The whole ‚Äòpump and dump‚Äô trope is simply fucking disgusting. Guys should be ashamed to do it, joke about it, laugh with guy friends about it. How is it possibly funny be totally disgusted by a girl yet lead her on and use her for sex? Why are other guys supportive of this shit? Ugh. Blech. Gross."

130,"When you go through relationship threads on Reddit looking to see if anyone else feels the way you do. If you find a comment that talks about your gut feeling being wrong, about having doubts at the back of your mind - even if the relationship itself and your partner are great - you are looking to break up. I ignored these feelings when they popped up in my head of ""this isn't what I want, this isn't who I want to marry"" throughout my last relationship that lasted almost 2 years. I tried to share my doubts and be honest with my ex, who to his credit worked on himself and tried to do better. We moved in together because when things were good, I felt wonderful, but I couldn't shake the nagging thoughts of wanting to be with someone else (I didn't have a person in mind, I just wanted to date someone other than my ex). I thought my fear of commitment to him would quell after we moved in together. To no one's surprise but my own, it amplified my uncertainties instead. I finally ended the relationship for good because he is a great guy and he deserves to be with someone who is absolutely head over heels for him and treats him like he puts the stars in the sky. At my best, I was a good girlfriend, but I was mostly lukewarm in my emotions towards him, and I really hurt him for a while. I know better now to follow my instincts."
131,"I am in this situation. My boyfriend just graduated from Harvard Law, works for a well-known civil rights org, and recently won a Supreme Court case.* I‚Äôm an artist who also works a sort of boring middle management job and makes way less money and kind of feels trapped in said job because I need the money even though I‚Äôm making peanuts.

The main thing that helps is that my boyfriend is so incredibly gracious. He always sees the best in me and is genuinely impressed by my job (ha ha) and skills. I opened up to him recently about wanting to leave my job and feeling weird because he has such a purpose and clarity to his life that I just don‚Äôt have. He told me with genuine empathy that I met him at one of the few times in his life where he **did** feel sure about what he wanted to do, and that he spent many years as a journalist wondering if he should actually be a journalist, then getting to law school and immediately feeling like he sucked at law school, etc.

I think if your partner can truly value the *unique* things you bring to the table, and see you as an equal with their own (occasionally rocky) life journey ‚Äî then it‚Äôs all good, regardless of how society sees you or how you see yourself. Your ideal partner will understand that you‚Äôre not a robot. And you‚Äôre not perfect. But they‚Äôll adore you for who you are, and be willing to grow with you.

*^(Well, obviously he wasn‚Äôt the only one who worked on the case, but he was part of the team that did.)"

135,"I genuinely can't believe people still believe vaginas get ""loose"" from sex. Ironically, those who do think vaginas stretch usually believe it happens from number of partners and not frequency of sex (e.g. 10 one-night-stands with different partners vs. sex with one committed partner 100 times) which is even more bizarre."
136,I had zero libido or interest in sex anymore which was not normal for me at all. I was considering going to my doctor to have my hormone levels checked because I was sure something must be wrong. Then my boyfriend's sister invited me to come out with her one night to see a band that was playing. My boyfriend never wanted to go out anywhere or do anything so I was keen and we went. We had a blast dancing in the front front row and at one point the guitarist came over to me and pulled me in and started playing a killer riff over me and my panties instantly turned into Niagara falls. It was at that moment I realized that I was just fine. It was my relationship that was the problem. It had definitely gotten to a point where we were more friends than lovers and I knew I loved him but I wasn't in love anymore and that I wanted to explore other avenues. Our sex life was never great to begin with as he was a very selfish and unreceptive partner that always put his pleasure above mine but because everything else with our relationship was fine I just stuck it out. I've realized now though that good sex is really important to me in a relationship and eventually found a partner that I share that with.

Next sis - haven't met him, she seems happy and he seems nice, so as long as that continues, he's ok


Next sis - love him.  Probably my fave of the in-laws.  He's funny and out there, one of those people who makes things fun just being around him


Next sis - Meh, he's ok.  He makes her lesser than she was, but she's happy, so I hold my tongue.  He comes from money, tries hard to pretend he doesn't, and at a glance no one would guess, but it slips out at weird times.  He's ok as a dude, but I don't seem them together forever.  She got her tubes tied, has been up front from day 1 that she never ever wants kids, and he's still convinced she'll change her mind (this is the sister I'm closest to)

141,"Men who justify cheating with buzz words like ""secret polyamory"".

Incels. Men's rights activist. The guy who wrote the article that sex should be considered a public resource and we should just ""give women"" to incels. The same man went onto Quora to defend himself. And he proved he's delusional and seems to literally not comprehend women are people.

The men who don't ""get"" feminism and women's rights until they have their own daughter. It makes me think they just want to make sure their pure property doesn't get tarnished, and they still don't view women as people.

Sexist, bigoted men who lecture me about being wrong about men. I have so many amazing men in my life. It disgusts me when they speak on behalf of all men.

Men who tell me that I'm wrong about sexual assault. And want to give rape apologist defenses in an argument. And tell 100 women they're wrong about their lived experiences. Because as a man, they somehow automatically have a deeper understanding than actual victims of sexual assault.

Men who call sex ""water"". And insist they're being oppressed because they're not getting laid."

Meanwhile my whole family loves my soft spoken, intelligent, normal ass husband. The whole thing was so awkward and gross.

215,"People are just so much nicer to me. I used to get insults shouted at me on the street most days.  I was ignored in work.  In general, people were rude and unpleasant and that all stopped pretty much overnight (well, over the three weeks I stayed indoors because my face was in plaster).

Now people smile and talk to me, my opinion is valued in work, people rush to help me if I look like I need it.  It's been 8 years since I got the surgery at the age of 32 and I'm still getting used to how differently I am treated.  I didn't expect the surgery to change my life but it did, I'm seen as a completely different person now.  Some days I'm relieved that i can walk down the street in safety.   Some days it breaks my heart that the only thing most people care about is appearance.

I had been with my boyfriend for two years when I got the surgery and he is the only person who never commented negatively on my nose.  He still doesn't have anything bad to say about how I used to look. But he's happy to see that I'm happy.  We just celebrated ten years together and I do think my increased confidence is good for he relationship, regardless of how I look."
216,"Privacy.

I know this is a dicey one for a lot of people but I don't feel like I need to give up passwords, share texts, or report on my location at all times. And I want my alone time in the bathroom."
217,Most people of the opposite sex are your 'friends' right up until the point you make it clear you don't want anything more with them and then they ghost you. It hurts losing friends that way.
218,And they are all in relationships. That‚Äôs pretty remarkable

223,I bought a water flosser. Dental floss won‚Äôt fit between my teeth. I was already brushing pretty well but this is a whole new kind of clean. I love it! (I‚Äôm also surprised how many people don‚Äôt know about brushing your tongue.)
224,"He makes realistic lion roaring sounds while chasing me, biting my ass when he catches me. Silly, but laughing only helps get me in the mood."
225,I started being more selfish. Doing things that I liked. Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù more. I also had to tell myself that people who need fixing don‚Äôt NEED me and I certainly don‚Äôt need to help fix them.
226,"It‚Äôs so annoying! I usually skip through any oral tbh, it takes too much time and is avoiding the good stuff"
227,If you are shy/anxious/socially awkward/generally quiet but also attractive people assume you are rude and standoffish

229,"My husband‚Äôs uncle really really wanted a boy, misogynist comments the whole lot. They had a girl, and he wanted to try again for a boy. Nope! Just after that the one child policy came into force. Single daughter it is. Then she grew up, got married and pregnant. He really really wanted a grandson. Nope! Girl again (parents were thrilled with their daughter). Just recently the Chinese government has relaxed the policy so now you can have two kids, so the cousin had another baby. It‚Äôs another girl. Funniest thing ever."
230,"When I went on vacation without him and didn't miss him, after that my first thought was ""how am I going to get an apartment for myself"". I knew it was over right there. 2 months after I was living alone."
231, I respect that you maintained a positive attitude through it all! It‚Äôs all in the mentality I suppose
232,"I agree with this. It might be because I am too lazy to actually care about my hair but yes, I agree."
233,"Ooh, Diana. She's a good pick too!"
234,don't use soap to clean your vagina! apparently there are a number of women who do this and it's so bad for your vaginal health.
235,"When we broke up but admitted neither of us have anyone/anywhere else and what can I say, misery loves company. She's depressed and I'm grieving..."
236,Was that autocorrect or do you actually call it your Snapple?
237,"I've had very very short hair, think carey mulligan in Drive, still a feminine cut but I remember getting less attention from men and getting hit on by women on a few occasions. Whereas now that i have long hair, I get hit on a lot more by guys, and don't really get attention from women anymore."
238,"I came here to say this! I use the trimmer with no attachment on the bikini zone, and then a very short attachment for the rest of it. 

I had issues with ingrown hairs and irritation from both shaving and waxing prior to this. I love this method. I always feel well groomed, there's no sharp stubble, no break outs, and it's so easy. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking to switch things up!"
239,Thank you so much for letting us relive this special moment.

242,Now there's a pun to crow about!
243,"The Responsibility Pie

I can play a part in something without being fully responsible. It's classic ""All or Nothing Thinking"" to assume that just bc you are a little responsible means its *Your Fault*. Example, one time my friends and I were too loud at a restaurant and someone complained, and everyone else was like ""oops im sorry! Well be quieter!"" Meanwhile i felt sick, my mind was going ""bad person terrible guest you're disgusting how dare you be so inconsiderate about everyone else you dont even deserve to be here."" Therapy is amazing."
244,"Not much involvement in my life. I remember being told, "" stay happy"" instead of inquiring about why am I not happy. Why am I always in my room? Why don't I have friends? Why do I dress bad or not into fashion like my sister? Why don't I take pictures of myself? Why don't I have a boyfriend? How are my studies going?  They know nothing about me. I have spent the hardest years of my life, feeling like I had no one. Even when I told them I went through depression, I got not much response like you should have told us or whatever. My aunt really takes care of how daughter presents herself, I think I too would have liked it, because I am figuring it out all on my own.The part that I liked, they never stopped us from doing anything and there were no gender roles, that as a girl I can't do something a guy can't."
245,"In the fifth grade Tracy said that she didn't steal my Barbie dress but she totally did and I KNOW she did because I saw it in her case later on during our next Barbie session and there ain't no way her mom went out and bought her the exact same dress that I just loss

I KNOW she took it!"
246,"When I went to a party and a guy came on to me, hard, and I wanted every ounce of it. (Didn't cheat) but it made me realize I had no passion for my husband and we were just roomates going through the motions. I left 3 days later and I am so much more incredibly happy."

I also watch het/hentai when it involves anal because my brain is good at imagining guys in the place of girls."
249,"Um well she can be nice at times but she makes my family feel insignificant and as if her family is more important than my brothers family. She says she feels unwelcome in my parents household when my mom tries so hard to make her feel welcome. It‚Äôs a long story but my brother has become nonexistent in my family, unfortunately."
250,"It's so bad. His name suits him well, though. He's exactly what I'd picture a Slayden to be; a bratty, bossy, manipulative, and overall annoying little shit."

254,"Slow can lead to very deep/intense orgasms, depending on the approach so yeah OP go for slow!"
255,"That happened to me and honestly it was the weirdest thing in the world to experience. He was awful at hiding it and when I finally knew for sure, it really didn't move me in any way at all. I thought something was wrong with me for not caring but then a few months later, I realized I simply wasn't happy with the guy and broke it off."
256,"Just got out of one that dragged on too long, and I‚Äôve been in a couple other shitty relationships besides. Here‚Äôs what I learned is a no-go.

-Selfishness in the bedroom. You never orgasm, but your partner always does. The other person dictates all sexual acts performed, and any sexual act that would please you (even if it‚Äôs mutual pleasure between you both) is banned.

-Coupled with the above: Refusal to take and act upon feedback.

-No interest or participation in your hobbies or interests; eye-rolls, sighs, laughter, passive-aggressive comments, or rapidly changing subject if it comes up

-Feeling frustrated, frightened, or annoyed when you‚Äôre due to spend time together. Hanging out becomes an obligation.

-You need to be drunk and/or high to have fun with them, or all interactions involve alcohol or drugs.

-Ad hominim attacks (‚Äúyou‚Äôre ______‚Äù) or black-and-white thinking (‚Äúyou always/never _____‚Äù), even if you‚Äôre not fighting

-Negative comments about your body or appearance that are framed as being ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù or ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù (‚Äúyou‚Äôd look better if you lost some weight,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really broken-out today‚Äù)

-Control over activities: you never get to choose a restaurant, movie, event, or travel location.

-Disregard for your time (getting stood up, random/unplanned communication blackouts, lateness, staring at their phone in silence during together time)

-Disregard for personal hygeine and/or cleanliness

-Disregard for safe sex or pestering you for certain sex acts or children

-Disinterest in meeting your family or friends

-Disinterest in your feelings, viewpoint, or perspective"
257,"Urinating in public.  Not making an effort to find a bathroom.  My neighbors were throwing a small party and I caught one of their guests peeing against their backyard fence.  Mind you, he was on the outside of the fence standing on the sidewalk.  I know for a fact that that house has three bathrooms.  I yelled at him from my bedroom window and he told me to mind my own business.  He then went back to the party.  I'm assuming he probably didn't wash his hands."

262,"Before I married my husband, I had a few friends tell me I could do better (cuz he's fat). Lemme tell you,  they were so damn wrong. I'd had ""cuter"" boyfriends and no amount of good looks trumps a caring, honest,  intelligent,  and FUNNY partner. 

My husband does most of the cooking,  ALL of the dishes,  gives me massages and orgasms. I love him,  he's my teammate."
263,"Should read, ‚Äúnever heard a valid bad thing about Michelle Obama.‚Äù"
264,"I think the part where my partner admitted to having feelings for a coworker he'd lied to me about, right after having the best sex we've had for a while. 

I was in denial and shock for a while and all explaining aside i think those actions spoke the loudest and clearest over time. It kinda just screamed ""I like being connected to her, but having sex with you."""
265,"Years ago, a man posted a question here about what we thought of a very, very, very specific kind of man. If I remember correctly, it was ""What do you think about a man who sits in coffee shops at 11:00 on Wednesdays eating a muffin?""

He might have even specified the type of muffin.

269,I agree. I have a friend who does this and it baffles me. He wonders why he‚Äôs single. Maybe because you look like you‚Äôre going to murder someone man.
270,"My ex in a way said its unfair that women get to be choosy while men have to do so much. I said men have the lowest risks when choosing a partner, and even in the animal kingdom the female animals have to be picky for not only their safety but their offsprings. He understood but its telling if a guy doesn't get basic things about women and how women are vulnerable in this life."
271,"A man can orgasm first, but it's thinking that sex ends when they orgasm, because only their's matters."
272,"Honestly, anything as long as it's mutual and both people freely offer it. Some couples fuck other people, some don't kiss till marriage; some couples keep money separate, some merge everything... compatibility is more important than the actual thing, IMO

That said, I personally think that it's unreasonable to want something that you don't offer. If you want a fit partner, it makes sense if you're fit (or getting there) yourself. Or a single dad that won''t date a parent - seems imbalanced and unreasonable to me. Or a woman with $50K in debt that wants a financially set partner. I think that leagues exist, and as long as you're seeking out partners that align with your own values, communication, lifestyle, life-stage, most any request is reasonable"
273,"Your vagina is not a muscle that needs to be worked out to stay interested in sex. If you no longer want sex, it's your libido that's the issue not your vagina."
274,"How very interesting. When I was researching German names, I saw it specifically mentioned that names should never be inappropriate or based on a joke, but I figured that was a customary rule, not something that was legally enforced."
275,"So I have type two diabetes and I developed it at a young age (20) because of PCOS and probably also my shitty eating habits. I was in the break room when I had just started my new job several months ago and this coworker came in and saw me checking my blood sugar and was like 
‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt know you had diabetes RedMakeupBag98.‚Äù
And I was like yeah, and he‚Äôs like
‚ÄúType one or two?‚Äù
I was kind of annoyed by this point because I didn‚Äôt really know the dude and I don‚Äôt like talking about my health conditions with people I don‚Äôt know. But I answered anyway and said type 2.
So then he was like 
‚Äú you know what would help with that? Losing weight. You should try it.‚Äù
And then he just walks out of the break room, and I burst into tears. Months later, I‚Äôm still super salty about it and I go out of my way to avoid this dude."
276,"My mom. When I was around 18-22, I on-and-off told her we should move to her mother and siblings' city. We were having major financial troubles and things would have been easier there financially. She never accepted without showing a good reason. 

Over the years I realized her sister alone is actually a pretty shitty person who is only faking niceness as well as she can and my mom would be even more miserable there emotionally. Also that nobody should move anywhere they don't want for *only* financial reasons."

283,"Probably distinguishing between things I can and cannot change. I‚Äôve had trouble with anxiety since I was a kid, especially in social situations. She helped me realize that I can‚Äôt control what other people think of me or how they treat me. There‚Äôs no perfect thing to say or way to act to get someone to like you. All you can do is be kind and be yourself. It‚Äôs fucking hard, but it‚Äôs true."
284,"Oh man, don‚Äôt ever check out posts about her in social media then because I see horrible stuff about Michelle Obama even to this day. A lot of conservatives even still maintain that she‚Äôs transgender. Let‚Äôs not forget the whole sleeveless fiasco either üôÑ."

291,"as the oldest my parents pushed me to be the best and gave me all the resources and encouragement to be the best like tutoring, time, basic necessities, and incentives. but i rarely ever heard them say they were proud of me. instead it would be ""you have to do get straight As next year too"". they never heard praise growing up and believing hyping your kid up will make the kid have too much ego and lead to their downfall.

&amp;#x200B;

instead i grew up feeling like i was never enough. i realized at age 13 that *i* need to be proud of myself and my accomplishments, and now im better and happier and dont need validation from anyone \~ and maybe a little big headed now lol"

301,"So I'm Latina and grew up in south florida so I never really felt like a minority. Until I went to north florida for college and started dating a guy from the area. His family is all from south georgia and I got called brown. I'm also on the paler side from what you'd expect if I told you that. Luckily I'm able to laugh about it but damn. Also, nobody knows how to cut my curly hair! They all ask if I want it straight/blonde and freak out when they see it."
302,"Like: manners were drilled into us from an early age. You say please and thank you and you're welcome whenever possible. Being kind and polite will get you much further in life than being rude. But they didn't just tell us to say please and thank you, they practiced it themselves and made sure to give the same to us.

Dislike: My dad had different standards for me and my brother. I could be a tomboy and play with rocks and transformers all day long and it was not only allowed but actively encouraged. If my brother so much as hinted that he wanted to do something that could be perceived as feminine my dad would snap that it was for girls only and he wasn't a girl was he? Was he??? And there were other examples of how we were treated too, but that stands out the most to me. It caused a rift between my brother and I growing up and we fought a lot as kids. Our relationship calmed down a lot as we grew older thankfully."
303,"Including lying by omission, sneaking around, etc. And the worst part is when they try to blame that behavior on you when you catch them. ""Well, look how you reacted. I kmew you'd be upset.""

305,"Your uterine lining doesn't just keep building up on oral hormonal birth control and the bleeding you have on BC is withdrawal bleeding (not a true period). BC keeps you from ovulating and the uterine lining stays thin, avoiding the need to shed the excess every month. My friends always freak out when I tell them I skip my placebo pills to avoid bleeding, asking me how I don't get an infection/feel ""heavy"" or gross from ""all the built up blood in there.""

Obligatory side note that every body/uterus is different and many uterus-owners like to take the placebo pills (to avoid potential spotting, ensure they're not pregnant, etc.) and there's no problem with that! I just prefer skipping them and haven't had any issues with it personally."
306,"Ok so hear me out 

I can't find the link to the thread this advice was on but it's from a lady stripper who had to keep it nice and smooth down there and lemme tell you THIS CHANGED THE GAME FOR ME. No more bumps or ingrowns like it's literally so smooth.

First grab some baby oil and cover the area you wanna shave. This softens the skin and hair which helps avoid razor burn.

After 5 mins (or however long you wanna wait) I hop in the shower or bath and let the warm water soften things further. 

EXFOLIATE!!! This gets all the dead skin off and reduces ingrowns! You will get a closer shave this way 

I currently use this antibac men's shaving gel. It's doing incredible so far bit.ly/32wHq7Z

Then with a mens razor (the ones with the metal handles and reusable heads) and shave with the grain. If I fancy a closer shave I shave sideways after but never go against.

Exfoliate again if im feelin fancy (but very lightly. I have no idea if this improves the results tho) and then PAT the area dry. 

I then moisturise with some thick E45 cream, let that sink in and then apply some plain Dove antiperspirant stick. The moisturising one. I know it sounds odd but good lord this stuff works. Let everything air out and dry for a bit and then put on some cotton panties or no panties at all! 

I probs explained this horribly and I am on mobile but this shit has made me so smooth! If I can find the original post I will share!"

308,Being emotionally distant and closed-off because they think it makes them look manly. A man who can express his emotions is so much more attractive.
309,"Idk if anyone‚Äôs mentioned it yet, but I like to go once over with the grain and then again sideways of the grain. For me, it gets me as close a shave as going full on against without the ingrown hairs"
310,"I initially went because a lot of good things happened to me and it overwhelmed me so much that I just cried all the time and felt so stressed out from the perceived pressure. 

I ended up learning that I inherited certain beliefs from my parents that are not useful, such as 

1) Everyone in our family is so fundamentally weird that outsiders will always judge us harshly, therefore expect other people to disappoint you

2) You can prevent bad things from happening and protect yourself from pain by constantly anticipating the worst and searching for the dangers in every opportunity

3) Other people's love is insubstantial but you can prevent their departure through unrelenting perfection

It really helped me figure out that I was unhappy because I felt certain that every good thing that happened to me would a) be taken away because I wasn't able to be perfect enough and b) draw attention to me that would illuminate to everyone I knew that I was fundamentally small-minded and undeserving of my success. I started trying to build self-esteem that wasn't based on my achievements and forced myself to stop creating artificial distance between me and people I wanted to be close to because I was afraid of them seeing the ""real me."""
311,A lot of people say never but I'm not ashamed of saying sometimes. There are a lot of touchy feely people and I always want to strangle them when their hands touch me inappropriately.
312,"I haaaate going with the grain because when I go against, you can‚Äôt see any of the follicles/hair. When you go with, you can, and I end up feeling like I look like the dotted part of a raw chicken, because I‚Äôm very pale and have very dark hair :( but then the aftermath gets so bumpy and I get acne! It‚Äôs awful, but I just hate how it looks close shaved with the grain...tips for that, maybe? If you have hair anything like mine that contrasts heavily to your skin."
313,"Left an abusive marriage and the next relationship I entered was not the healthiest. She wasnt abusive but she towed the line. I was called a ""woman"" and ""girly"" because I liked romantic comedies and coming of age movies. I worked manual labor and would soak my feet. That was a little to much self pampering for a man to do. The worst was I was supposed to know the way she thought things where done and would get told so after I did anything ""wrong""."
314,"I may not be the main market they're after, but as a raging kinkster I enthusiastically enjoy violent, degrading sex. BDSM (which includes rough sex) is a good way of exploring personal and societal traumas in an intimate, safe setting. Sharing your worst urges with someone you love, or trusting someone to hurt you without harming you can be fulfilling and exhilarating for us freaky folks.

But most of these producers aren't processing trauma. Some of them ARE the trauma."

(My boobs are bumpy, hairy, pimply, and stretch-marked, and that's fine, because they are bags of flesh, not cherubic artistic masterpieces. Stop putting the boob on a pedestal! It's just a body part!)"
320,"I think a relationship is based on comfort is necessary it means you are comfortable communicating your problems. I think the main issue is that when people get into relationships, the main problem is ""you used to look like this or you used to do this but you don't anymore"" basically not meeting a expectation. But when your both on the same page if don't think a relationship built on comfort is a problem, the problem is when the relationship is too stable meaning there is no growth between two  individual people. That is when it's starts being an issue."

327,"I had something similar to this happen to me.  But it wasn't in a redneck area and I was 22.  Whenever he saw me, this guy would always take a dollar out of his wallet and toss it on a table, saying the same thing as the kids in your experience did.  

And then when I did pick up it (because one man's idiocy is another's gain), he'd say, ""Dirty Jew.""

He finally got called out on it when he did it in front of the professor of our class.  His excuse was, ""But she keeps taking the money so obviously she's okay with it!""

And my professor rolled her eyes and said, ""Well, of course, it's free money.  Who wouldn't take free money from an idiot?"""

329,Some men would make you really believe they love you until you realize in the end they never did and just you for anything. That is trashy behaviour especially men who love using women for sex and manipulative them making them think they love them when they don't. Now I'm not naive anymore I can tell who fucking with me or not.

340,"I like that I was raised without gender roles for the most part, but that may not have been entirely intentional, which brings me to the major thing I didn't like. My parents were largely uninvolved in my and my siblings' lives, and that had a huge negative effect on me and my brother."

We moved to his hometown but only for a few years. The cold and racism was too much, so we moved to Florida. 

I was bullied SO MUCH in elementary school. I was the only Hispanic kid in a class full of blonde hair-blue eyed meanies in small-town Illinois. Stuck out like a sore thumb. I used to go to the nurse just to get out of class. I hated it. I remember they used to make me speak Spanish all the time and I felt so special. Later I found out they were just making fun of me."

That doesn‚Äôt need to be here. It‚Äôs not part of the reproductive system. I hate that they always put that there.‚Äù

Like yes, it‚Äôs in the same region but if we‚Äôre looking just at the straight up reproductive system, it‚Äôs not involved."
346,That‚Äôs child sex abuse can cause permanent damage to the pelvic floor. Women who were abused should read up on it- learn what to look for and tell their gyno so they can be proactive about future symptoms. Men should know so they can be an ally. People in the justice system should be made aware so that the severity of the crimes against a girl can be better understood.

And I don't even understand HOW they think the labia gets stretched - are they yanking on their partner's labia during sex? Have I been doing sex wrong??"
358,That goes for any object. Never go from A2V.

Waxing is also pretty painful the first time. Gets easier the thinner the hair gets but the first time is rough."
364,Strange that women have to take time out of their day write fanfiction for other women whereas men have an entire multi-billion dollar industry catering for them. It's sort of a showcase of how underground female sexuality is lol.

367,"I started focusing on my own pleasure and happiness and walking away from the narrative that choosing happiness in your life is self-indulgent/you need to suffer to be of value or earn respect. 

Started small, then slowly but surely it became easier to give myself what I wanted on a larger scale. This includes material items, relationships, time spent, etc. 

I think my biggest ‚Äúchoose happiness‚Äù moment came when I moved to a city I fell in love with. It‚Äôs even easier to tune out the noise of others peoples ideas of success or how your life should look when you‚Äôre far away from it."

371,"The average woman does not have a body like Kim K. It also, annoys me how people assume a lot of women should be skinny but have a big ass and big boobs. You need body fat to have an natural large boobs or ass. If you have any body fat some people will deem you automatically ""unattractive"". I'm really tired of these impossible beauty standards and men thinking it's possible if she skinny it's more likely she has an ass or boob job. It's real for a woman to be skinny with big boobs and a big ass that's the truth."

I grew up in a strict Persian/Muslim household, so I wasnt allowed to look at a dude when I was in school. Then into my twenties when my parents started hounding me about when I was going to have kids, I was out of my element and had no idea what to do. So I didnt...

Got myself an FWB that kinda taught me the ropes sexually. 

It wasnt until I was 29 when I started dating, and had my first boyfriend at 30. 

Even though I feel that growing up unattached built a lot of independence in me, I still wouldnt recommend it. I grew up being afraid of my body, and timid with boys. Even now at 37, I still feel like I make those same relationship mistakes that youre supposed to learn when youre in your teens. I feel naive and juvenile sometimes. But big picture... I'm pretty well adjusted and kinda normal :)"

375,I taught an Eljay with a brother called Ceejay and a sister called Kaycee. I felt bad for them.
376,"Not OP, but was in the same boat. I think it has to do with the precedent set by our parents. They are our first experience of love. If they teach us that love means abuse, we tend to confuse red flags of abuse for love."
377,"I‚Äôm the alpha Relationship, been with my spouse the longest"
378,"Refusing to do any house work because they view it as ""womans work"".

Her name was ‚ÄúMyHealing Promise‚Äù. Insert *eye roll*

The mother had named the child this because she said that God had told her this child would be her healing. 

The mother was in a severely physically abusive relationship with the father, the child was terrified of the father. The child always came in with an odor of urine on her and needed a bath daily(at daycare), always had a urinary tract infection and severe diaper rash.  CPS would do nothing because the child showed no signs of physical abuse(bruises, cuts etc.)"
387,Another useful thing my housemate has done recently was get a menstrual cup and record how much blood you lose over your period (hers has a little scale up the side). Turns out she was losing about 80ml in the first couple days which is the max you should be losing over your entire period!

389,"As someone who used to follow a couple gay porn blogs before the Great Tumblr Porn Ban, I'm guessing gay porn would involve a lot more frotting, prolonged close-ups of twunks making out and artsy angle and lighting choices.

Overall it'd be a lot more Art House, many times gentler and more sensuous and there'd be fewer close-ups of destroyed \*\*\*holes."
390,I think we need some kind of sign to say: Hey I'm a lady who's into ladies and I'm single as hell! Like a scarf or socks or a pinky ring. And it should definitely be more subtle than anything rainbow. Many cultures (have) use(d) these kind of signals and I think it would cut the awkwardness of flirting by at least half.
391,"Oh she's 10 going on 13, so there's some moodiness and hormones, but mostly she's awesome -- smart,  independent,  creative, etc. 

FIL is not just mysoginistic, but also narcissistic (and insane) and we eventually cut him out of our lives a couple years ago."
392,"As someone who's had bad experiences in losing everything, as well as fear of failure and being a burden, you bet. Especially having applied at different jobs in the past for months without success.

Enough slip ups or one big slip up at work could mean losing my income, home, car, at best moving home with parents, at worst going homeless."

395," When  her doctor recommends it.  I mean, what other kind of answers would you expect?"
396,"She asked me to look back at myself at vulnerable moments. Like when I was 8. I was scared and hurt and showing my first PTSD symptoms. It was heartbreaking to remember that pain and imagine myself back there. 

Then she asked me if that little girl deserved to be hurt. If that little girl deserved to be adobe and afraid. Obviously I said no.

She told me to treat myself with the same compassion I had for that little girl, because we are the same person. I need to give that little girl a life she deserves. 

I want to become the woman that little girl wanted me to be."
397,"A friend of mine was offered a position halfway around the world for a contracted two years, with a great salary - but he was in a newish relationship. He asked what I would do in a similar situation and I said I‚Äôd take the job, and pretty much encouraged it as a great opportunity, but looking back I know that what I said was coloured by my own experience.  
  
He declined the job and they‚Äôre married now! I don‚Äôt technically know he‚Äôd be *worse* off, but he definitely wouldn‚Äôt be married to *this* woman, and they‚Äôre head over heels for each other."
398,"I disagree with about 99% of the things my parents did when they were raising me. They used a lot of severe, physical punishment, which I have no problem calling abuse today. They enforced strict, dated gender roles on me. They refused to let me have friends over/let me go out with friends. I was required to care for my younger siblings for no money and at the drop of a hat. I did the bulk of all the household chores, even in elementary school (and if I did them wrong or too slow, I got hit or lost a privilege.) When I became a teenager, my mom constantly made comments about how I was such a moody temperamental teenager, even though I wasn‚Äôt. She also frequently made comments about my weight and how ‚Äúshe‚Äôd never looked like that at my age.‚Äù I was not allowed to criticize them for anything, even as an adult. And even now, they complain that I never come home or talk to them, like they haven‚Äôt the foggiest idea why. 

But we were never homeless, so there‚Äôs that."

402,"I met my husband at age 18. We married when I just turned 24. I had those thoughts of maybe meeting him too young and what about all the other people I haven't met yet. The way I decided was to think hard about how it was with him and was I likely to find a different person who fit with me better. I decided that there was no one who fit with me better, decided to get married and stopped looking and wondering. We have been married 39 years."
403,I have a few friends who seem to always fall into relationships with controlling abusive types no matter how hard they try not to. It's a fascinating and terrifying mechanism and I'm not sure how or why it forms - do you have any insight on why you find those types attractive?
404,"I recommend the documentary [Tea with the Dames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7363336/reference).  

Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Eileen Atkins have been getting away and spending time together for decades - since their kids were little - but now finally allowed cameras in to film their conversations.  I found it immensely enjoyable."
405,"The one he used to be married to I fucking hated. No I still hate her. I have never, in my entire life, called someone the C word, but with her ooooo I get so close I can absolutely taste it. I love my niece so much, she is so wonderful, but there is a not-zero part of me that kind of wishes niece wasn't in the picture, because it means that this garbage person will be in our lives forever and there's no getting rid of her. 

The one he's currently married to? Oh she is an absolute peach of a person. I want to wrap her up in a blanket and hug her. She's wonderful. She loves my niece and my niece adores her and it makes me so happy to see. And my brother is happier than I've seen him in years, it just radiates off of him at all times."

412,"Guys who objectify women. The ones who arent single but act like thirsty dogs behind (or in front of) their girlfriends who seem to JUST CANT HELP but oogle at ""hot"" women they see in public. As if its the first time they've seen boobs. Perverted men, esp taken ones, are trashy and should be avoided. You can be a sexual person but love/respect your partner. Its a lie guys ""can't help it"", its just a lack of moral respect and sexual immaturity. I could never be that way in a relationship, my ladyboner is all about my bf or else I wouldn't date them to begin with. No excuse."
413,Yeah I don‚Äôt like it when they slap the girls so hard their face turns red or force them to look like they‚Äôre dying while choking on a dick. Everyone should be having a good time!

419,"I have experienced this, too. Coupled with the seemingly prevalent idea that they think that their being attracted to a woman is the only requirement to having sex: ""I don't think you know how attracted I am to you!"" O...kay? 

I also think that there is a difference, overall and with exception, with wo/men's libidos. Personally, mine is really reactive, and I don't just go from 0-100 like that. But, yes, thrice-divorced-with-four-kids-15-years-my-senior-dude... a ""quickie at lunch"" is TOTALLY appealing! It's porn consumption that is leading many men to think that real life happens like that, coupled with entitlement, and equating the average man's sex drive (and likely satisfaction per encounter) to the average woman's. 

I chose to be abstinent most of my 20's - saved me baggage, risk, unsatisfying encounters, disease, heartache, and it was a choice I happily made. OMFG, the number of men (and some women, but less so) who thought I was ""squandering my youth,"" by seemingly not fucking them, was repulsive. I have only ever had sex in a relationship, and it's better for me that way... so, no, having random sex doesn't seem appealing at all. And yet, so many guys thought that because THEY wanted to fuck ME, it should automatically be a mutual thing

In part, I blame porn and the type of sex positivity that is only positive/ supportive of having lots of sex, no strings, and being kinky. There are lots of reasons why this is a thing, but that's been my observation in men who think that having random sex is, overall, appealing/ safe/ fun for women"

He also is passionate about sex and how it should be for a women.

425,"Wanted to say this. As well as not understanding women aren't a hive mind. I see so many ""Do women like men with freckles?"" ""Do women like men who wear all black?"" ""What do women think of men who order lattes with extra foam?""

Like seriously. I don't care. Most women I know don't care. And there's 3.5 billion women. There's bound to be a good million who are into what you're insecure about. And we don't sit and have a meeting once a month where we all decide what our preferences are. If that was the case. Only one kind of man would be coupled up at any time.
