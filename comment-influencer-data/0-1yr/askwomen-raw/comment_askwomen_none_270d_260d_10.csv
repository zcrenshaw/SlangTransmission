0,We we're out walking our dog and strolled past some flowers. He picked one and tried to place it behind my ear... The problem was he was also holding a bag of dog poop that was hitting against my face while he tried.
1,Compulsive lying.
2,"Maybe an egg the size of a chicken's egg, but a chicken-sized egg scaled up to human size would be about nine inches across, and passing one of those every morning sounds unpleasant."
3,"My husband is such a goof but sweet but not what I’d call romantic. He’s very practical so instead of giving me Valentine’s Day presents or flowers every year, he gets the oil changed in my car and leaves a note with a Valentine’s theme (sometimes it’s a card if it’s february) that says “oil is changed...love you” 

First few years I was like seriously...now I swoon since I don’t have to deal with the oil change place. 

Edit: I just told him a comment about him being practical and not romantic got me 2464 karma. He asked me what karma was good for...that's my man. "
4,"I'd love to see ads for skincare products with people who actually have acne, rather than people who already have perfect skin. "
5,"My first boyfriend gave me a wooden box with a padlock on it for Christmas one year, handed me the key and told me not to open it until I got home. 

I opened it and inside was a little jar of his blood, and a little jar of his tears. 

I was 17 and mortified. Also couldn’t fathom how he got enough tears to fill a small jar, so I asked him. Turns out he’d plucked all his nose hairs and eyelashes to gather them."
6,"I have a huge collection of cookie cutters because I love to bake. I kept them immaculately organized in small boxes, bags, etc, in the drawers of my kitchen island.  Some had small pieces because they were things like snowflakes you cut multiple ways, some had tiny individual letters for stamping messages. I also really have a lot of other kitchen things because I love to cook.

He texted me at the start of an 8 hour barista shift that he was reorganizing our kitchen as a surprise for me and getting everything consolidated. I remember freaking out and begging him to not do it and he was like “no, it’s good I promise! It’s too late! Don’t worry!”

And then I got home and he had dumped all my cookie cutters into two HUGE reuseable grocery bags, threw out any boxes or bags that were keeping sets and pieces together, so everything was loose and now impossible to find small bits, it was a HUGE disaster. I still think he threw out some actual cutters because almost two years later I still can’t find some pieces. I cried for hours because I have been so careful over the years with my collection and in one afternoon it all went to hell.  Some of them got bent because they needed to be handled with care.

He also emptied out some teas that were “old” which had been favourites I ration for bad days, that aren’t made anymore. 

I feel bad that I went a little crazy and cried, but he just doesn’t get how much he screwed up my collection that I spent years building and keeping neat."
7,"I was in the hospital, confused and pained. Due to my mental state at the time, I accidentally missed the commode and peed on the floor. He scooped me up, put me back in bed, and quietly wiped my pee off the floor. Came back over and kissed my forehead like nothing had happened.

It's not what they say. It's what they do."
8,"my boyfriend at the time ditched me after he helped me move, saying he had better things to do. my friend helped me move so long into the night that he slept (on the floor :() there, went to his lectures, and then came back and didn't leave until every bit of my maddeningly complicated ikea furniture was put together.

i called my mom that night and told her how it went down. she asked ''uhhhhh and why isn't Friend your boyfriend, again?'' i said wasn't sure if he felt the same way. she legitimately laughed at me and said i was stupid. i married him 4 months ago :)"
9,"I asked him to talk dirty to me and he said ""I want to put my penis in your vagina."" I wish I was joking. I wish he was joking."
10,"When I broke my foot really bad and he took off work just for the first couple days to help me out because I could barely get around the house (like, butt scooting down the stairs-level of immobility).

Then when I found out he was literally teaching himself Italian just so he could use it with my family

Also I was taking a real quick online course a few months ago for a job I’m working on, and I actually was having a little bit of trouble with some of the material. I was complaining to him about it and he asked what chapter I was on, I was like “um 6 why” and he was like “oh good I’m already there.” Dude literally bought the whole ass textbook on audio and was listening to it to and from work so he could help me with it. I actually cried."
11,"I introduced him to a girlfriend of mine with the intention of setting them up. We went to the movies and she sat in the middle, and the whole time all I could think about was that I wish I was sitting beside him instead. Turns out he was thinking the same! Been married 2 years now :)"
12,"My ex boyfriend surprised me and took me ice skating at Rockefeller Center for Christmas once. It was a really sweet idea, but he had said we were going to a show so I was not dressed warmly at all. I was wearing a dress, tights, and a lighter but formal jacket, with no hat, gloves, or scarf. I was so cold after we had been on the ice for about twenty minutes that my lips turned  blue and we had to leave. The thought behind it was really cute, but it would have gone so much better if I had been dressed appropriately. "
13,"Jackhammering, thinking that ramming their finger in and out of you will make you cum, not knowing what or where the clit is."
14,"In the beginning of our relationship, he went on a trip to Rome with his family. He brought back some shoes for me, a 6'1 woman. He was so excited when he handed over those (pretty nice) size 6 slippers. It was hard to break to him that I loved them, and I loved the gesture - but I am a giant and a size 10,5."
15,I mean I already take a poop every morning how different can it be?
16,"When we started seeing each other, I lived in London and he was here in Ireland. I had a bit of a health scare and ended up in hospital, rang him, told him not to worry and that I'd keep him updated. Fell asleep and four hours later I woke up and he was sitting by my bed, holding my hand. He'd just dropped everything at home (very difficult for a farmer to do) and came to look after me. Stayed the week I was in hospital and then insisted I go to his place with him to recover, where he continued to nurse me back to health like a massive, ginger Florence Nightingale.

It's the most anyone's ever fussed over me."
17,"So he wasn't my SO, but a guy who asked me to junior prom.

He shows up to my house with our mutual friend, and a sign with a bouquet of flowers right? Except the sign is written in Hindi - which I speak, but can't read or write. After blankly staring, I recognized two of the characters and they were ""p--m?"". It occurred to me that holy shit that probably says prom :O.

I say yes and whatnot, but as soon as he leaves, my mom goes ""he spelled it wrong"". lol

she's such a hater  


Edit:  
I don't remember how he spelled it in Hindi, but it was basically proam, like roam/Rome but with a ""p"". Haha. My guess is type prom in Google translate Hindi and whatever comes up is what he wrote :P.  


I did think it was very sweet! My mom is just sassy. &amp; Yes, I'm Indian by birth! He knows I speak so it was a fair-ish assumption to think I write/read :)."
18,"Dear lord. Hadn’t done the math. 
I was thinking Cadbury egg or smaller in my head. "
19,Bad temper/yelling 
20,"Some dude who worked at a counter in the supermarket literally grabbed my cart to keep me in a conversation. wtf, dude."
21,"He gave me milk + honey by Rupi Kaur and underlined the parts that applied to our relationship. Including the parts about how fucked up and unhealthy it was and how we knew we needed to break up. For my birthday. He was confused when my reaction was just a lot of crying. 

Edit: Im a little late but for clarification, he wasn’t breaking up with me. He thought he was just being like sensitive and sweet? Like he underlined mainly the love parts but also stuff from the hurting section of the book. I did break up with him about 2 months later.. should have done it sooner but glad I did it eventually. This helped me realize I had a pattern of dating “sensitive” guys that are not sensitive in the right ways. You all have helped me realize it’s probably time to get rid of that book!!! "
22,"I love lilacs. My date tried to drive up to a bush of them on my side of the car while rolling down my window and all of the branches just crashed through my open window scratching me all over my face and arm. I looked messed up, he felt so bad...I laughed in the WTF was that kind of way. Oh, I also didn't know that's what he was doing so to me it was really WTF. "
23,Narcissism/ selfishness 
24,Casually touching/tickling my waist. Makes me so uncomfortable. 
25,"A lot of these remind me of a story my friend told me about her first Christmas as an engaged couple living together. She wanted a new winter coat for Christmas, like that's all she wanted.  They were out shopping and she found one she liked on sale and told him to get it and wrap it and be done with it.  He was like.. no I don't want you to see me buying it, that ruins the fun, plus I bet I can find a better deal.  Christmas comes and she opens her gift. It's a coat! Except... it's her old one. He tells her to look in the pocket, she's thinking maybe it's the receipt for a new one that's being shipped.  Nope. $100. He's all excited that she can pick out exactly what she wants now.  "
26,My ex got my initials tattooed over his heart. He surprised me with it - I pretended to be flattered. We broke up a year later. I wonder if he still has that tattoo.....
27,"I want skincare ads to stop hyper-focusing on anti-aging.  Men are allowed to age gracefully, it's time women are allowed too.  Aging gracefully looks a hell of a lot better than being 50 and trying to chase after your 25 year old face.

I want makeup companies to be compelled to use the actual product for makeup ads.  Not pro tools and photoshop.  If that mascara is so groundbreaking - why is the model wearing false lashes?  

The cosmetics industry is run by people who hate women, I think."
28,"When my dad was in hospice, my boyfriend would take me to see him everyday because it was hard for me to go alone. One evening, the nurses came in to bathe my dad, which had to be done with wash cloths from basin of warm water that they wiped him down with while he was still in bed. My dad didn't want us to leave, so my boyfriend, my sister and I all stood there watching. At this point my dad was days away from dying, he was completely out of it and so thin you could see every bone in his body. It was uncomfortable for me and my sister to watch, and I can't imagine how uncomfortable my boyfriend was having to stand there while my naked father was cleaned in front of us. My boyfriend never said one word about it to me though. He never got upset, he never said he was uncomfortable, and he continued to take me to see my dad everyday. He even picked me up from school on the day that we got the call that my father was going to die soon, and then sat in the room with my sister and I for HOURS before he finally went home so that we could be with our father alone. "
29,"I want to see a tampon/pad commercial that seems realistic. No, I'm not going to be dancing around in white pants and cuddling stuffed animals because I shoved a certian brand of cotton in me. And no, a pad will never make me feel like I can freely move as I please. One shift the wrong way and nine times out of ten it's leak city. "
30,"When you tell them what you prefer, and instead of taking it on board, get defensive and say, ‘I THINK I know what I’m doing!’ 

No, you don’t. If you’re ploughing along doing something that is not pleasurable to the other person, then that’s a sign of immaturity and inexperience. Someone who knows what they’re doing is secure enough to listen to your preferences and act on them."
31,"Cruelty. If they're going to be unkind to everyone else, it's only a matter of time before they start behaving that way to me. "
32,"When I was 17, alone in the kitchen with my boyfriend's dad. He came up behind me put his arm around my waist and pulled me towards him til there was full body contact. I managed to slowly turn myself out of it. I was pretty freaked out. I recall now his wife was away that week and my boyfriend at the time had only gone to the car to fetch the shopping. "
33,"I dated a guy once, who lost his virginity with me, not that I knew that. 
He also clearly never watched any porn, ever. 

I swear to god he inserted his penis and *left it there.* 

The next day I suggested he might try moving backwards and forwards next time. 

He got so excited afterwards, ""oh my god, you were *right*"" "
34,""" I wish to engage in consensual coitus, attractive female!"" "
35,"My boyfriend is an auto mechanic and he orders from snap on a lot. He was super excited because he ordered me something from snap on for me. Hyped it up so much, I was excited, it took a few months to arrive. It was 6 pairs of pink thick work socks. 
I started laughing because I thought it was hilarious and sweet. I was expecting like a flashlight or some cool tool for my car. Just some socks he thought I would like.

I love socks but I dont like pink and they are too thick for most of my shoes. Tbh i havent worn them yet. I feel bad."
36,"I was stuck in the hospital for about two weeks with an infected gallbladder and pancreas. He came EVERY SINGLE night to see me. Up to that point, we had only been briefly hanging out as friends. But the fact that he was so concerned about me that he took time out of his day, every day, to visit me made me realize that he was someone I wanted to be to very close to in my life. We’ve been dating for 7 years now. He’s an amazing soul. "
37,"A couple of years ago, I went through a difficult time while pregnant. After weeks of terrible back and sciatica pains, doctors found a tumor inside my spine that had to be removed quickly because it could cause a lot of damage. Fortunately, everything went well. But I had to take a lot of time off at work, first because of my back surgery and then because of maternity leave. Coming back to work was difficult, recovering from two surgeries and taking care of a newborn took a lot of effort from me and I wasn’t able to be a top performer at work like I was used to being. 
There was this co-worker who was not very helpful during this time, she criticized everything I did and was very demanding when it came to “showing results”. I have to say that I wasn’t doing a bad job, it just wasn’t good enough for her. She made me feel very bad. 
A few months later she got pregnant and had an awful first few months, a lot of complications that made her be exhausted or in a bad shape all the time. I tried to be nothing but supportive with her, I knew how it felt. 
One day, she gave me a ride home and when we arrived at my place she told me she needed to talk to me about the way she had made things more difficult for me in the past and how being pregnant had helped her realize the importance of having each other’s back. She cried and apologized, I cried and told her how much her apology meant to me. We’ve been very good co-workers and friends ever since. "
38,My husband got me some pajamas for our first Christmas as a married couple from Victoria’s Secret. One of the pajama sets had a shirt that said “single all the way” I was like eerrrmmm? 😂
39,This is painful to read. I'm so sorry that happened! I think your reaction was fair. Was he apologetic?
40,"I was in a surprise period situation a few weeks back and thought about how great my experience would've been if used as an ad.

I was in a meeting, felt ""the feeling,"" and panicked for a moment. Excused myself, hoping there was no leakage on my khakis, and speedwalked to the bathroom. Of course someone was using it, so I'm nervously standing there waiting. It felt like forever.. Then I finally get in the bathroom and see an entire basket of free Always Infinity pads. I almost cried with relief. Those are my absolute favorite brand of pad *and* they were complimentary! 😭"
41,"Left my key on the breakfast table on a work trip.

CSO said to me ""oh, only if I was twenty years younger"" when I came back to get it."
42,"I won’t date another guy who has no respect for my time. I used to get soo annoyed with my ex because it was impossible to nail down a time or even a general time of day to make plans! So I would have no idea that day if we were meeting for lunch or if he wasn’t available until later at night for drinks. And if I somehow was able to get him to commit to ""around lunchtime,"" sometimes I wouldn’t hear from him until 3 or 4. 

Umm no. I have things to do too so at least have the courtesy to give me a semblance of a plan so that I can arrange my day accordingly."
43,"Last year for Christmas he made me one of those cute signs that has a quote, the date of our marriage with a frame under it and the dates of our three children's births with frames underneath for their infant photos. Cute idea, but he over estimated the space he would need and this fucker is HUGE. Like 3 ft tall and almost as wide. I have nowhere to actually hang it and if I'm being honest, it's kind of ugly. He put a lot of work into it which makes me feel bad."
44,"I tell myself I have to do three productive things before it's couch time and I leave my phone in my purse until I'm done.  This usually ends up being 3 relatively quick things like water plants, clean cat litter, hang up coats, clear the kitchen table, pick up and throw out old receipts, put shoes back on the shoe rack etc.  Because once I take out my phone and sit down productivity ends. "
45,"Is anyone eating these eggs? Is there an egg market? Can I sell them to weirdos on the internet? If so, then YES. Always up for an easy buck "
46,I should probably have clarified that this happened pretty soon after we moved in together and once he realized how badly he fucked up he felt HORRIBLE. He helped me reorganize it as best I could but he just doesn’t get why keeping the boxes was important. To his credit in the 2.5 years we’ve been together he has never done anything else like this he is the LITERAL best partner in every other way. One of my Christmas gifts this year is actually going to be going to the container store together and getting some small boxes to reorganize everything finally.
47,"I would like to see commercials of women involved in sports, being badass, without having the women in the ad have to explain/defend their confidence in the sport. I know that sounds odd, but what I mean is that, I see so many commercials or ads that say “just because I’m a girl, doesn’t mean I can’t fight/play hard/etc.” 

I was a female athlete growing up. Instead of so much talk in ads about women not being acknowledged the same in sports, I’d like to simply see a badass commercial with women in it. No explanation of having to fight against norms or sexism. But instead “fighting the sexism” by simply showing the woman being badass and marketing whatever brand they are selling along with it."
48,"One day when I was unpacking after a long trip with our team, he called my name and I turned around. He was just casually standing there with a big smile on his face. Maybe it's because I was dazed from the travel exhaustion, but man. I suddenly was thunderstruck by how beautiful his smile is. I got flustered and forgot what I was doing for a moment and couldn't see him in the same way after that. 

EDIT: Reddit has been egging me on for months to say something but I'm still too chicken. I have never asked a guy out at all, let alone a coworker, and I'm just frozen. I get convinced he'll laugh at me, be disgusted, and hate me even though he is a stand up guy and really wouldn't. Any advice about this mental block and what to do next is appreciated"
49,Wtf this is the strangest thing I’ve ever heard
50,"""When you can afford the waffle maker we want."""
51,"To be fair, those are delicious and that makes this question a no brainer"
52,It would depend on how large the egg is and whether laying it hurts or not. 
53,"All of a sudden I cared what he thought. I desperately wanted to get every reference he made and impress him with my knowledge. I basically started studying his favourite films and games.

He was talking about going to see the new star wars film and even though I was never interested in films like that, I watched every film and the new one, just so I could talk about it with him. 

We've now been together 3 years and I now genuinely like all the things he does, not just to impress him.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold anonymous!"
54,"When I was 18 there was a time this guy was hitting on me quite a lot, we'd been chatting for a while and he seemed nice and he was cute but I didn't want to go beyond that. When I said as much he got increasingly desperate about trying to convince me saying it would be amazing, I still said no and that I needed to call it a night because it was late, and then he said and I quote ""Aww common! It'll only take 2 minutes!"" I hope he thought back to that moment at some point in his life and reflected upon it."
55,"When he showed he cared about us and not just about him. Not so long ago we had a small argument and I started crying because we started bickering a lot lately and I was feeling frustrated. He could have ignored me, tell me I was being unreasonable, or leave the room - but instead he held me in his arms for a long time. Then he told me, ""I know we've been arguing a lot lately. But I am not giving up. I know your heart and I know mine. We're both good to each other. We'll get through this and we will be okay."" He's the only man I've been with where I can truly feel the love. He's so kind, patient, and loving. His love is more than just his words or kisses - it's his desire and willingness to fight for our relationship. Whether that's the cultural/racial conflict that arises, or when we are struggling with each other in such a high-stress time of our lives."

57,"I’m 35. At 32 I finally left my terrible marriage and 4 weeks later (to the day) found a lump in my boob. Breast cancer. I was SO CLOSE to graduating college finally, but now with medical debt, I can’t go back to finish. I lost my health insurance, my ex-took my reliable car (it was in his name cuz he made all the money)and now I have one that is constantly breaking. I can’t get a decent full time job cuz I don’t have a degree. Luckily my job from before cancer let me come back part time, but it’s 25 miles from my house and I spend a huge amount on gas and car repairs. The last 3 years have felt like one slap in the face after another. I feel like I’m drowning. This month I finally emptied my savings and had to ask my mom for money to make rent. I’m lucky I have an apartment and for that I’m grateful.

I had a promising job interview this past Wednesday and if I get it, it’ll be the best paying job I’ve ever had &amp; I can start to crawl out of this black hole. Unfortunately the only reason the job is open is because a friend of mine died and our mutual friend, the manager, desperately needs someone to fill the position ASAP. 

I keep telling myself it’s gotta get better, it’s gotta get better, it’s GOT to get better. It will get better. I have a great family, an awesome boyfriend and the world’s chillest cat. It’s gonna get better. And when it does, I know what my priorities are and I’m never going to let myself be financially dependent on anyone else again.  

** Thanks for the kind words! I just woke up to all these comments and I feel like I threw myself a pity party last night and that wasn’t my intention. All the encouragement has really made me feel loved though. 2019 IS gonna be awesome. Thank you!"
58,"A lot of the time I question if they don’t realise. 

Calling me certain things like delicate or fragile. Standing too close and then when I step back they step closer again. Not taking no for an answer about seemingly minor things on a date or when organising a date. "
59,"I keep my work clothes on, and I try not to sit down, especially not on the couch.

Once I change or sit, it's all over in terms of productivity."
60,"I am 20 years old and one of my uncles still likes to pinch my cheeks, pet my hair, then hold me by the nape of my neck. He recently married someone 15 years younger than him, about 8 years older than me. I’m always very uncomfortable at family gatherings."
61,"There is a guy at work who talks over everyone, loudly. Always prefaced with ""Sorry to interrupt, but..."" Like, no you're not sorry because you keep doing it! Stfu, Dennis and stop interrupting. I don't even know if he could fake ignorance on that one

Otherwise, the biggest thing that makes me uncomfortable is saying that ""this is awkward"" when it's not. Or doing the subtle ""because of the implication"" thing when we're alone at work or wherever. Like, I wasn't creeped out before you made a joke that I should be! That kind of humor should come really really slowly"
62,Or they know where it is but rub it too hard right off the bat.
63,"He went clothes shopping. He said, 'I want to get you some shorts, because I know you need them.' I said, 'please don't, because I can't always find good shorts that easily, and I want to pick them.'

He decided to do the grand gesture of buying me bright yellow arse cheek shorts. I don't wear yellow, and I prefer my arse cheeks covered."
64,"Once you catch someone in a lie, I start to second guess EVERYTHING"
65,"“I love you” accidentally coming out of my mouth. I forgot what I was gonna say to him, but that came out instead"
66,Quitting heroin after ten very long years.  
67,Link to commercial above for anyone interested :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4DDpS685iI
68,"This shit always pissed me off as a kid whose parents both had cystic acne and created a cystic super acne baby. 

Yea, dude, fucking Hayden Panettiere is *really* feeling the same shit as my middle school ass with the worst acne in the school. 

Put up the kid who was close to killing himself until he got your shit ffs. "
69,General toxic behavior. Control issues. Temper. Being self centered. Inconsistent reactions. That.
70,"Jabs his fists into my kidneys during doggy. 

Ultimate goal for him is his climax. Says ‘did you cum?’ After he has cum but had made no effort to make me cum while we are doing it. 

Thinks ramming his dick in and out is the wildest thing for me to get off. 

Unprovoked acts of porn like ramming my head hard onto his dick, spitting on me, slapping me hard, aiming for immediate anal penetration. 

Looks shocked and like he’s doing something wrong if I rub my clit during- thinks it means it’s not proper sex.
"
71,"Hehe, my ex bought me a bunch of lingerie we couldn't afford from VS and it was all too small. When I had to return it, the sales girls all remembered him and thought it was sweet, but I had to explain that he had bought this with our food budget for the month and it didn't even fit, so could I please have it refunded to the payment method? Mortifying."
72,"Happened once years ago. When he introduced us (the group of friends) to his girlfriend... I felt a sinking, crushing feeling... That's how I knew..."
73,"Yep.  I was a bully in high school and earlier.  I made a lot of people hurt.  I am/was a really bad person.

About 3 years after I finished high school I faced some hard truths that led to some tough introspection.  I found out I really did not like myself.

I spent the next few years contacting people and apologizing.  I am ashamed to admit I do not remember what I did to whom in specific.  At the time, it was nothing special, each individual act.  

It hurt.  It stung, reaching out to people about terrible times in their lives that I could give the vaguest and general of apologies.

Some people did not remember me, some people hung up on me or rejected me, some people cussed me out.  Some people forgave me.  I made some people cry.  I heard a lot about how much people hated me.

It sucks.  It is not like the movies, where there is some tearful forgiveness scene.  I cried a lot.

If you feel the need to ever ask for forgiveness, do it now.  Not tomorrow, not when you get it together, now.  The best time would have been when whatever it was happened, but the second best time is today.

Edit: Oh, damn, I misread the question.  I turned it around.  Oh well.  "
74,"He bought me a beautiful pendant for our first anniversary. Unfortunately, he did not know that I'm allergic to nickel (it had just never come up) and didn't know to check on the materials used. I had the chain on for an hour when suddenly I broke out in a really bad rash.

Fortunately, I had a different chain I could use to still wear the charm."
75,"my first time sleeping with a guy was in my first year at university, had been speaking to the guy for three months and decided that I trusted him enough to be my first time. I didn’t outwardly say it was my first time, but with how awkward I was about it and how much blood there was afterwards, he knew. 

for the next MONTH he went around bragging about taking my virginity (he couldn’t find the hole for like 10 minutes, spent a lot of time grinding against my thigh and when he finally did find the hole he slipped back out again after the second thrust and we had to start all over again), yeah I was certain after that that I was his first time as well. "
76,No more women laughing eating salads!
77,"He told me had a surprise for me for Christmas. Was wrapped beautifully and he taunted me with it for days and then finally let me open it. It was a butt plug. I cried, he went home. "
78,"He knows I love Harry Potter, so for our first Valentine’s Day together several years ago he picked out (on purpose) the ugliest, scrawniest individual flowers from the shop and had the florist put them in a bouquet. When he gave them to me, he said he thought they seemed “very evil and creepy”. I sometimes wonder what that poor florist was thinking when she wrapped them, and also that my fiancé clearly needs to reread the books. Funniest and ugliest shit I’ve ever seen though 😂"
79,"Years ago I was out to meet some guy and honestly after the first 3 minutes I saw enough red flags that would have made me leave, but I stayed because I was starving. But I'll just stick to the one he might not have realized:

We got us a small table with only two chairs, one on each side. I go sit down on one of them, expecting him to get on the other side of the table and take his seat over there. But no. The table was big enough to fit two persons next to each other so what does he do? Grabs the chair and puts it next to mine. Forcing me to sit between him and the wall.

He was WAY too close and I hate feeling like I am stuck. Made me unconfortable as hell. Like.. we just met. Get out of my personal space and don't make me feel like I am trapped, please?"
80,"I used to have pretty gnarly acne all over my back and shoulders, painful and red, when we first got together. I'd had it for as long as I could remember and it was probably primarily hormonal acne. He wasn't grossed out by it at all and would clean and medicate it without me asking him or mentioning anything about it. It's always made me feel so ugly and afraid for anyone to see me naked, but it made no difference to him at all. He wanted to help me through it. "
81,"Someone who ghosts and doesn't communicate what's wrong. Been there, done that. So done with it. If something is wrong, fucking tell me. I don't do hints. "
82,"YES! 
I once had a guy defend himself with ""but my ex loved this!"" Well she's not here right now right? ... Is she?"
83,"I don't know if this counts but if they don't have a clear view, aggressively rubbing the junction between thigh and vulva. "
84,"Getting fit in my 60's.   
I could now run rings around my 40-50 year old self."
85,"Buying a house on my own. That, or quitting smoking after 20 years. "
86,"My ex booked a surprise trip to Poland for my birthday, during which he also booked a trip to Auschwitz. Had to wake up at 6am on my birthday to spend the majority of my 21st birthday at a death camp and being given a tour of gas chambers. "
87,"In that case, I’d take it. No more ruined underwear, no more expensive tampons. "
88,"Fumbling more than a couple minutes with the condom. 

Asking if he can finger me, and just jamming his sausage stubs into me repeatedly. 

Not checking if I’m wet before plunging his junk into my junk. 

Regularly pauses, stops, or breaks rhythm when getting me off. 

Failing to reciprocate/not asking *how* he can help me finish; might instead ask me *if* I finished and shrug/look sad if I did not. "
89,Skipping foreplay!
90,"I've found that men are surprisingly confident about guessing women's clothing sizes, and yet unsurprisingly they are usually very inaccurate in those guesses.  I've written before about the guy who told me he wanted to date a size 2, which he clarified meant they'd be a little bit bigger than me... and I was a size 4 at the time.  Just another example of confidence != accuracy."
91,"Reminds me of some guy that came on FFA asking how to buy his girlfriend shorts. He said he’d bought her like 4 different pairs that didn’t work and it’s hard to know what she’d like because she never wears shorts, only dresses and skirts. I asked like “Well dude, why do you keep buying her shorts?” and he was v offended."
92,"Well there was this one time I hooked up with a guy I didn’t know very well, but I was interested and wanted to see if I could get a quick lay in. We met at a bar (usual) He was very confident, sly and sexy. We get back to my place and he starts taking off my clothes, but weirdly wanted to keep almost all of his still on. Alright, dude...whatever floats your boat. So after he puts on a condom, he flips me over and starts trying to do anal with me. I spin quickly and just say, “No, no I don’t do that. Let’s just do it the normal way.”
He looked at me like I was speaking Romulan. 
“What do you mean, the normal way?” 
I just blinked for a minute.  I was thinking, was he really this obsessed with anal that it’s the first thing he goes to?
“The vagina way....”
So this is kind of how the conversation went from what I can remember.,,
“What are you talking about? That would hurt...and that’s dangerous.”
“Um, I’ll be okay—it’s not my first time.”
“I’ve never done that before.” 
“Oh. That’s okay, if you don’t feel comfortable doing that, no problem. But I’m sorry I don’t feel comfortable doing anal.” 
“I mean I’m sorry I just don’t want to get peed on.”
At this moment I knew this poor man (20 something man) had no idea what was what.
“Um...I wouldn’t pee on you...that’s a different hole.”
He didn’t believe me for the longest time but I had to sit down and explain to him how there are three different holes. The urethra (the one we urinate from) the actual vagina (for sex, menstrual, birth) and the asshole.... for well, taking a shit. 

This guy thought the ASS was what we used to have sex and give birth with, and have our period with!! He thought the vagina was what you used to pee with and didn’t even realize that there was an actual another hole called the urethra. 
I was amazed. Seriously flabbergasted. He was completely embarrassed and didn’t believe me at first, and got angry and left quickly. A few days later he texted me apologizing and saying I was right. 
I don’t know what trauma he has had in his life or what has happened to him to not learn basic sex Ed and to go on thinking that for so long...that’s just crazy to me. 
That’s the last time I go to a cheap bar in a bad part of town.... 🤦🏻‍♀️"
93,"Don't worry. As soon as you do get married it changes to ""When are you having kids??"""
94,"I fucking love your husband. What a decent dude. 

With so many selfish people out there I am so drawn to anyone who helps me or others out just to be caring. "
95,"Shortly after we started dating, I took a picture of my now-husband and set it as his contact photo in my phone. He's just looking at me/the camera and smiling, nothing terribly exciting or weird. A few months into our relationship, for whatever reason, my mom asked me for his number. I sent her his contact, complete with the picture. She texted back that it was weird for her to have ""such a romantic picture"" and said ""I mean, just look at how he looks at you!"" Four years later and he still looks at me like that."
96,Why did he just guess at your shoe size?
97,"When a guy (often a stranger) has to squeeze past you and instead of just saying excuse me or nudging you slightly, they kind of (gently) grab your waist or the small of your back to move you out of the way a little bit. I don't know you, don't touch me like that. I always wonder if that's the same way they'd move a man that they're trying to squeeze past."
98,"We’ve been close friends since we were 7 and best friends since high school and throughout college. Fast forward to us at 22. We had been getting drunk as shit and eating pizza and donuts together while watching movies on his couch every weekend. Eventually this turned into us being friends with benefits but never saying anything about it haha. After around 6 months of this, I had a very bizarre and cheesy dream where I sat down to have a conversation with myself and dream me said “You know you love him right?”. We ended up hanging out again the next weekend and taking acid and I told him how I felt while tripping. He said he loved me too and then a week later I moved across the country for grad school lol. He eventually moved here a year later and now he’s snoring next to me. Our 3 year anniversary is in May ☺️"
99,Doesn’t know how to hold his body weight off you for thrusting
100,That’s actually incredibly sweet and I love how excited he must’ve been!
101,"My ex had to do a cover-up tattoo for his first ex-wife's name on his arm. He's needing another cover-up tattoo for the partial quote with his third ex-wife's name down his side... He should probably consider a cover-up for the name of his daughter with third ex-wife that he abandoned and has since been adopted by another man... 

He clearly never learned either, because he wanted a matching tattoo with me.... "
102,"My grandmother had given me her first pair of diamond earrings when I was 13 or so. They had been given to her by my grandfather. Huge sentimental value. I wore them every single day. 

Eventually the silver posts tarnished and one broke when I was 25. I tucked the earrings away safely in my jewelry box for when I could afford to fix them. 

I moved I with my husband a few months before we got married. I was looking for the earrings to go and get them fixed for our wedding and couldn’t find them. At all. I just knew they had somehow gotten lost in the move and was sick over it. Like crying and wailing over this (my grandmother had passed like the month before so it was a raw wound). 

Turns out my lovely, dumbass husband had taken the earrings out of my jewelry box and had gotten them repaired already. It was supposed to be a wedding gift. "
103,"I don't know, she probably needs that finger"
104,"Assuming about Cadbury egg size, and no more pain than a big #2. "
105,I hate it when guys tickle me. Somehow when I tell them I don’t like being tickled they take it as an invitation to do it more. 
106,"When I worked at a bank, this guy would come through the drive thru to cash his check and always tell me to “smile, I’m prettier that way” or  “why are you always so mad? You’re so young and good looking, life can’t be that hard.” I used to get so freaking annoyed. One day he came in and pulled a fucking cold can of coke of out his ass or something and offered it to me. I was like no thanks man I don’t want it. And he proceeded to shove it into the teller drawer and repeat to me how much trouble he went to for this coke for me and I should be grateful. It was sooo uncomfortable because he wouldn’t leave until he saw me open and take a sip. I just opened it and said thanks and he left satisfied at that. I dumped it right when he pulled away. "
107,"If people are willing to buy dirty panties, then people will buy human laid cadbury eggs"
108,"Wasn’t my SO, but a guy who was interested in me (who knew I was happily dating someone else) sent me a bouquet of flowers when I was having a bad day. 

The flowers were honestly beautiful and my SO and I got kind of a chuckle about it, but *man*, that was inappropriate. "
109,Unprovoked acts of porn is the perfect term for it.
110,"Yesterday my SO was having a meal with lamb in it (I had already eaten). He said it tasted really good and asked me to try it. I said I don't really like lamb. And he said, but you have eaten lamb before right? And he promised me if I didn't like it he wouldn't feed me any more. I said no 2 more times and he proceeded to fill his spoon and headed towards me. I ate it and I hated it. And I told him I didn't like it and he seemed disappointed. I'm feeling irrationally angry over this exchange now for God knows what reason.

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to generate so many responses. Appreciate everyone sharing their stories - I feel a lot better now, not because you guys are suffering lol but that my feelings aren't petty. Thanks all! ♥️"
111,"Failing to reciprocate. Fumbling. Jackhammers with his fingers and dick. Says braggy things that sound like they're straight outta porn. Terrible kissers. Tells me they know what I like best when I'm trying to guide them. When they try to make ""moves"" and it's something they're replicating from porn. ""How many times did you get off?"" when the answer is zero lol 
"
112,"Mine bought me an expensive 3 month supply of a diet plan which consists of shakes, pills and patches. I was so pissed I didn't even open it. Who gives someone a diet plan for Christmas???? "
113,"So this friend had asked me out months before but took rejection perfectly. He kind of avoided me but we were in the same friends group and he didn't make things awkward at all. We slowly started talking again and I enjoyed his company. Then I had a dream. I don't remember the dream, but when I woke up I just knew in every fiber of my body that he is the guy I was going to marry. 

I'm not romantic. I don't believe in love at first sight. I don't have time for that nonsense, but I couldn't shake the feeling. I didn't change how I treated him, and waited for two weeks, but I couldn't shake it. I was in Canada on a work trip, sharing a rental car with a terrible coworker (read stuck in my hotel room) and lonely, so I texted him.

It didn't help, so when I got back we hung out which almost immediately turned to dating and 2 years later were still inseparable. "
114,"Yep happened somewhat recently.  I had an excessively needy friend who demanded my attention, insulted my life choices, and pretty much constantly harassed me digitally for more and more attention.

I cut her off... years later she sent an email apology.

I couldn't figure out how to respond so I read it over and over for a couple weeks and archived it.

I hope she really is doing better now, I just can't see us being friends again."
115,You should try wearing them instead of slippers in the evening or weekend morning? My husband got me piston earrings from snapon. I'm a parts tech so it was pretty awesome. 
116,"Well, he technically never became a SO but a guy I briefly dated “serenaded” me by singing, and playing on the guitar, “Miss you” by Blink 182. Plus some John Mayer song I can’t remember (no, not Your body is a wonderland -thank god-)

I mega-cringed. It was our first date and OTT.

Kissed him to make him shut up.."
117,"For our first Christmas as a married couple my husband went last minute shopping at Costco. I ended up with pillows, towels, and granny panties."
118,Wow that really does sound like it would make a good commercial. And make way more fuckin sense than prancing in a field 
119,Took me to flower shop to get me bouquet of flowers in a heavy vase I had to carry to his apartment where he said I should leave it. I was very uncomfortable about the whole thing and did tell him I didn’t like how he went about it. It was just so weird. Whenever I got flowers from other guys they brought them to me and let me keep them lol
120,"I bet he intended to buy her something else and then just never followed through and this was his last ditch attempt to be like ""I didn't completely fail to get you a gift."""
121,"There's people who buy girls panties that they have used to wipe their ass after a bad shit, you could definitely make bank off of selling your cadbury ova"
122,"A guy sent me a dozen roses (!) once after we went out one night. Problem was, I didn't know it was a date. He was a friend and asked if I wanted to ""hang out"". He thought it was a date, I thought it was just friends hanging out.  Sooo awkward when I got those flowers and realized he was on a completely different page. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guys: if you want to date a girl who is your friend, you really need to specify that. Asking to ""hang out"" will just make her think you're going out as friends. Don't try to Schrodinger's Date it. "
123,So he bought himself flowers but made you carry it? Lol
124,"After a long day of work, I deserve to rest. It's not lazy to take care of my needs. I'll get up early to get everything done. But after a long day of work, I deserve to rest. And so do you."
125,"He was just like “what”, completely in shock. I tried to say that I said what I originally meant to say, but he knew it was BS. He was distant for like the next week or so. We eventually went out though, like a few months later. Stayed together for 1.5 years but eventually broke up over his commitment issues. Still miss him sometimes "
126,"My grandad passed away on my mum’s birthday. My now-ex thought the ideal way to cheer me up was to book me a trip to Paris the following year, to commemorate the one year anniversary of his passing.

I can see the good intention behind it, but I really just wanted to be with my family. Especially seeing as it was also my mum’s birthday. "
127,I would also like for those commercials to NOT be for tampons or pads. 
128,"Yes! I have a coworker who would say, ""you look nice today,"" when I'd wear a specific skirt. Harmless, right? THEN he would follow up with ""I'd tell you how much I like it, but I dont want HR to get involved."" Ugh."
129,"One of the first times we were having sex. Suddenly it just hit me; I loved this man more than anything. We'd only been dating for a couple of weeks, so I held back saying it, but finally I just couldn't help it and I said ""I love you"". 

He stopped moving, just froze. Then he shuddered, whispered that he loved me too, then clung on to me and began to cry. We held each other and just savoured the moment.

Still together after nine years so it worked out."
130,"Once at a new job I asked my boss, the CEO, how I was doing.  He replied with ""My only complaint is that you're married.""  Yeah I didn't work there for very long (this was not the only creepy thing he did while I was there)."
131,"I want for commercials to stop using feminism as a gimmick. Like the one with different shapes of shampoo (or what was it?) or ""run like a girl"". Like wtf? Who gives a shit about the shampoo shape, and who the fuck compared it to a body before your ad? 

  
Basically, I want commercials to use feminist ideas (like accepting all body types etc.) without screaming ""LOOK HOW PROGRESSIVE WE ARE"" (like what Pepsi did with BLM). The shaving ad did it really well. Women have hair on their bodies. That's fine. That's not a radical feminist agenda, not ""girl power!"", women just have hair. "
132,I really thought this was going to end with him throwing them away and am so relieved that this has a happy ending.
133,That's actually kinda cute
134,"For my birthday one year all I wanted was to go to the melting pot (I had never been, now I know it’s not that great, but anyway) and he decided it would be better to make fondu himself at our place. Sounds nice, but he misread the recipe and used wayyyy too much nutmeg. It was absolutely disgusting, but I tried to be polite. The worst part was he got so defensive when I tried to suggest the recipe wasn’t quite right. We ended up fighting and he insisted it tasted great and I was just picky. Eventually he admitted it was inedible. "
135,Going from not being able to call Petsmart for my non-English speaking mother due to extreme phone anxiety to easily calling waiters over and asking people for directions on the street in a foreign country. It feels great to be liberated from yourself.
136,"My husband did something similar.  I like those oversized sweaters from Aritzia, so he decided to get me one for Christmas.  When I opened it up, it was the exact one I already have...probably just an oversight, he's not that observant sometimes.  Except then he pipes up ""I know you already have this one, so you can just return it and get whatever one you really want."" Thaaaaaaanks."
137,"classic case of ""i realised women are people with feelings when i had a daughter"""
138,I just read this and uncontrollably facepalmed at the last sentence. Oh my god 
139,Controlling behaviour. Been with a few guys before I figured out they were doing this. I won't stand for it anymore. Dumped immediately.
140,Don't block off our escape routes if you want us to concentrate on talking to you for the first time.
141,"I'm middle-aged. 

When I was a teenager, my younger brother and my dad did a lot of their ""male bonding"" over boobs. Tits. Ta-tas, gazongas, coconuts. They ogled them on TV together and discussed them, rated them, argued about which ones were best. 

I...didn't have any. Not really. Mayyybe I was a 34aaa by the end of high school. Somewhere in college I made it to 36a, sorta. 

They commented on this. A lot. My favorite was -- ""Don't ever cut your hair (it was long), it's the only way anyone can tell you're a girl. ""

A few years ago my brother's eldest daughter was just reaching puberty. He called me one night out of the blue, long distance from the Midwest, and said:

""Sis, look, you know all the stuff Dad and I used to say in front of you about boobs, used to say *to you*? I just remembered it the other day, and realized that if anyone EVER said ANYthing close to all of that to my daughter even ONCE I would fucking *kill* them, Seriously, I'd beat the crap out of them.""

""I'm so sorry we did that to you, it must've really messed you up. ""


It was pretty stunning to hear, after all those years, and it's one of the reasons I maintain a relationship with him -- even though he's an evangelical Trumpist, but that's a whole 'nother story.  I disagree with pretty much everything his life is about, but there's also that glimmer of hope. "
142,"It’s not the _worst_, but it’s funny.

I came home late from work and he had a “romantic” dinner laid out. I was extremely surprised because, well, he’s _not_ the cook in our relationship (for good reason lol). He also just used whatever was lying around in the fridge/house.

He had attempted to cook lamb (I personally don’t care for it - I bought it to cook for him, not me). It was just one single sad lonely piece of lamb medallion on each of our plates with all the juices dripping out. 

Then he popped open some wine his boss had given him a year ago (again, not a fan of wine). I took a bite and a sip to be polite, but it wasn’t that great...

A+ for effort though!! I still appreciated the thought and told him so.

Edit: I also did the dishes and cleaned up because “he cooked” lol."
143,For Christmas I am getting you a....chore. 
144,"I was in the hospital after a pretty traumatic emergency c-section delivering my son. The first time I stood up out of bed to go to the bathroom after the epidural had worn off a big bloody chunk fell out of me and splatted on the floor. My husband didn't even twitch. He just helped me to the bathroom and cleaned the bloody chunk off of the floor. Like, I knew he loved me but that was some next level devotion!"
145,"Nah man, it’s like the skin fuses to the cotton. You tug and it’s like your whole vagina is going to rip out like a prolapsed anus. Then once you get it out it’s like your pussy has cottonmouth and your labia minora get all jumbled up like a dog’s jowls when it sleeping upside down, but dry. "
146,"We went swimming with some of his friends at a reservoir in town. He forgot to take his chain off in the car so he gave it to me to hold since I wasn’t swimming. When we got back to his house I almost forgot that I was wearing it, I asked him to help me take it off. So he took it off my neck and then I helped him put it back on. We were in his back yard looking at his dad’s old truck, and something about it just felt so right. I wanted to kiss him so bad. But then I left...I’ve had a thing for him ever since (its been a couple months now). Not sure if the feelings are reciprocated at all, or if it would even be a good idea to pursue anything more than a friendship with him. Now I just try not to think about it when I see him. "
147,"I very much planned for and wanted my son, but right around the time that I found out I was pregnant my marriage started falling apart. By the time my son was born my joy at having a child was still there, but I was also scared, hurt and angry with my (now ex) husband. He left us when my son was 8 months old after months of emotional trauma verging on abuse and lots of cheating. So my journey with my son was, and still is, mixed. I love him and I’m glad he’s a part of my life (he’s 9 now), but being a single parent is hard, and going through my ex’s cheating and emotional attacks while postpartum was miserable. I really wish I had become a mother under better circumstances and with a better partner. "
148,"Ads that show men/dads doing housework and taking care of kids. 

There is a detergent commercial (Tide, maybe) that has a dad talking about washing his daughter’s clothes, and it’s a complete anomaly. "
149,When he freaks out after a queef...
150,"Took me to a fancy restaurant  and told me I could be better at sex and suggested a sex book that I read. I cried. Right there in the restaurant I cried in my fancy dress. Now days I would react completely opposite. In my defense, at the time I was 19 and he was my first/only lover. I loved him and we were still pretty new in our relationship. "
151,"It was quite early on, and I’m not sure we’d even said I love you yet. We were doing that quiz - the one that claims it can create love. It’s a bunch of questions about your experiences and ends up with 4 minutes staring into each other’s eyes.

One of the questions is to summarise your childhood and he went first. I barely heard what he said and I’m tearing up because suddenly it all comes rushing back that my mum had cancer in my early teens and I was convinced she was going to die (she’s fine now). It’s my turn and I start ugly crying and blurt out something incomprehensible. He took me in his arms and held me, stroking my back and kissing my hair until I stopped. When I looked up he was tearing up to, he was hurting because I was hurting.

That’s how I knew.

Maybe the quiz did create love???"
152,"Aww that's adorable and awful all at once, and I can't stop laughing now."
153,"My ex talked a good game about all the romantic gestures he’d done for HIS ex. Wrote her poetry, surprised her with little gifts, weekend trips, etc. So, I got pumped for my birthday with him. 

No gift, no card, because “he didn’t know what to get me”. We did go out to Panera, though. Then for Christmas, he gave me a coffeemaker, except I already had a better one. Then Valentine’s, a toaster to match the coffeemaker. I wised up then and returned it for some clothing I wanted. 

Never did get any schmoopy gifts from him, but I did find allllll of the lovely poetry he wrote for the women he cheated on me with! Thankfully he is long in the past now!"
154,this is metal as hell. 
155,I feel bad upvoting this lol
156,That's terrifying

158,"He told me I was easy on the eyes and that was it. Two kids, a huge move downstate, and countless life events later, we're still madly in love. "
159,"I have my dad to thank for this. Growing up seeing the way he treated my mom, and my siblings and me, I knew at a young age that I never wanted to date/marry a guy who couldn’t control his temper."
160,"Yeahhhh, we had a baby at the time too (he's not dead, he just grew up). He was a sweet idiot who needed constant money management. Hence the Ex part."
161,"Touch me on my lower back. It's a very sensitive place for me. I don't know why, but it just is. 

Even sometimes when my partners touch me there, I remove their hand. I cannot remember any woman touching me there, but random men do sometimes and I have to admit, most of the time I don't dare to do something about it.

Someone who recognizes this? Is it a weird spot to feel sensitive about?"
162,"Condescending teasing as flirtation, especially when I don't know the guy AT ALL. Making fun of a book I happen to have or a food choice I made at dinner does not endear me to a guy, nor does it make me want to talk to him more. I've done first dates or even just casual social interactions where a guy decides to fixate on something he finds ""cute"" (in that smirky way) about me, or tries to corner me into justifying why I'm doing something, like he is the judge of all my actions. I see flames every. single. time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware of negging as A Thing, but I really think there are men out there who just believe that trading barbs with a woman is like foreplay, and not a sign that the other person does not enjoy his company or the condescending way he smirks like he ""got to me."" And 9 times out of 10, it's some stranger doing this to me. It's not fun, it's not cute, and so often the guy doesn't even realize that I've written him off five seconds into meeting."
163,Shaving the spots for your hole-y jeans.  LOL!
164,"I think he just thought Harry Potter = magic, witches, etc. = Halloween creepy"

166,"Yes, you should always say if something is indoors or outdoors. For skating on an outdoor rink, I'd say something like ""it'll be cold and you want to be able to move in your clothes""."
167,That girls are either dorky as fuck or hot and mean. Some of us were dorky AND mean thank you
168,"My first boyfriend did not take it well when I told him we had some relationship issues, namely his codependency, and he began to cry sitting on his bed.

He pulled me into his lap, cradled me like a baby, and cried while he rocked back and forth and sang I Will Follow You Into the Dark by Death Cab for Cutie.

I’d never known confusion and fear like that before or since."
169,It was like he discovered Christmas. Bless him. 
170,Gross follow-up question: is the egg a chicken egg? Is it edible? I’d like to spend less money on eggs... 🤔
171,"When we feel like it.

I got married after 15 years of being engaged and living together and people had given up asking. We weren’t financially ready and had a constant barrage of things happening (school, grad school, moving around, multiple deaths in the family, etc) so we put it off. Getting married hasn’t changed anything about our lives except my last name and now we wear rings.

176,"Omg clothing too! Wife is *always* “about the same size as you”.  But the best was the guy who said “ok, she’s 5’8” and 140lbs”. I thought “oh awesome, this one actually knows his wife!”.  So I said “ok I’m 5’8” and 140lbs actually and I’m a size 8”.   Cut to a week after Xmas, I’m at the back of the store and I hear a woman bellowing “LET ME SEE THIS GIRL WHO THINKS SHE’S 5’8”, 140LBS AND A SIZE 8!!!”.  I turn and see this behemoth of a woman T-Rexing her way towards me, like the whole store was shaking. I swear to God she was easily 6’2” and 250.  Her tiny husband was behind her looking simultaneously terrified and apologetic.  She yelled at me for about 10 minutes about what an idiot I was for thinking that a size 8 would fit a women with those measurements while I looked pleadingly at her husband hoping he, or omg anyone, would tell her that it’s just possible she’s changed height and weight since she last checked IN THE FOURTH GRADE!!

A month before my 35th birthday I found myself in a brand new half a million dollar home in debt up to my eyeballs with an angry, abusive drunk of a partner.    I mean like 24 beers in a day wasn't an anomaly drunk.  And driving home drunk and threatening to kill me was becoming a regular thing. I'd just lost a baby at sixteen weeks.  I went through this alone.  I was sick, colitis sick, bedridden sick.  And dragging my ass to work to pay the bills because my partner wasn't making it to work that often and spent his money driving from beer special to beer special.  My previously stable industry hit hard times and my measly salary was scaled back 15%. This was an inconvenience to my partner and the big fight happened and I left before I was harmed.

Rock bottom for me was a mattress in my parents basement at 35 for the better part of a year. My belongings in a bin in their driveway.  Giving away my entire life savings to get out from under a house that didn't sell for six months, due in no small part to the angry drunk man continuing to occupy it.   Being downgraded fifteen years into my career.

My advice is this.  Be thankful for what you do have - it looks different for everyone.  I gained peace.  And my health.  And a major dose of humility.  I spent time with my dying father that I wouldn't otherwise have gotten.  I wasn't being terrorized in my own home.     

If you're at rock bottom, you're learning some major fucking lessons on the way down.  Let them make you a better person, a smarter person, not an angry one. All you can do is walk through it, and keep fucking walking. 

In the 2.5 years since, I have met the love of my life and we are starting fertility options next month, I'm a homeowner, and I found a job that tripled my salary.  Any myriad of things could have happened, and every single one of them would be better than me cowering on my bedroom floor waiting for a fist to connect.  Trust that you're going in the right direction."
180,"The regular pauses and breaks in rhythm is such a valid one. Especially when it’s the clit. If she’s moaning and writhing and breathing intensity is increasing,
You are doing it RIGHT. Don’t stop, don’t change areas, don’t start jamming a fingernail under the hood. Just keep going. Consistency is the key!! I’ve been with guys so bad at this that my moans almost become threats!! Hmmmmmm! hmmmmmmmm,
HMmmmmMmmmm??? Hummmmmmphhggghhh???? Urgh."
181,These responses are amazing to me! It seems like a lot of people don’t get these questions. I’ve been with my partner for just over four years. We can’t go on a vacation together without people asking me if I think I’ll be coming back with a ring. 
182,"Oh man, you just reminded me of a super infuriating situation. I have a friend who was recently proposed to. She is super allergic to the ring, it’s not even the type of metal or stone she said she liked when he asked her, *and* he refuses to believe her! He says her skin is green and rashy because she “doesn’t wash her hands enough.” "
183,"One guy motorboated my boobs and bragged about his amazing pussy eating skills, but come to find out they were definitely not skills I'd be bragging about."
184,I hope to god that she breaks it off
185,stop showing women in men's perfume ads
186,Same guy: Wants to do anal.
187,"I'll be honest. I do regret it. and I feel like trash for saying that, because each of my children were longed for and planned for.

One of my children is on the low end of the spectrum, and since having them, we have learned that my husband is on the spectrum as well. His symptoms have taken a serious downturn since having the kids, so I'm often doing this parenting thing alone.

My son is bright and funny. but he has started to become physically aggressive, he will hit himself, bite his fingers until they bleed, and because of his constant moaning and hand flapping, I can't take him to most public places. He is constantly trying to run away from me. I worry sometimes that he will succeed. We have all kinds of locks on the doors and alarms, but sometimes I'm scared that he will still find a way to slip out. 

I can't work because my husband can barely handle the kids. Once a month, I go out for about 2 hours to have dinner with a friend. They are increasingly leaving me behind because they have other friends they can see on a whim. Otherwise, I am with at least one of my kids.

my entire life is housework, errands, setting up appointments and taking my son to appointments, trying to work with him, playing with my younger son and trying to make sure that he's okay. Most of my family is gone and my in- laws have made it clear that they have little interest in our kids (but recently came back from watching their daughters kids for two weeks so she could go on vacation). 

I can't remember the last time that my husband and I had time alone. where we weren't trying to occupy the kids with TV so we could sneak off for a few minutes. It's been at least six months. Our insurance doesn't cover respite, therapy is expensive, and nobody wants to watch my son.

When my husband is home, he just sits looking and acting absolutely miserable. He rarely interacts with our kids but to bark at them because they interrupt him while he's sitting on his phone. I have to tell him every little thing to do. I've tried to talk him into therapy, and I've done everything I can to get him out of the house, because then at least he's out of our way and not putting a damper on our mood. I am so much happier when he's not home.



I think ultimately, I regret who I had my kids with. Autism history is clear in that family now. I didn't expect that their father would be a poor parent. even considering that, I didn't imagine that I would have a child on the low end of the spectrum when the rest of the family is on the high end. 


But that's a difficult thing. Because I love my son exactly as he is, even though there are challenges and difficulties. I know for sure that I could have had an easier life. But my children are still very young, and a lot can change in the next several years.

I am certainly praying so.
"
188,"not an SO but a friend bought me an eyeshadow palette that i had been wanting for a while and a handle of vanilla vodka. i try the eyeshadow out immediately after he gives it to me and it starts to burn. turns out that it was a knockoff he had ordered from china and i had a horrible allergic reaction to it. could barely open my eyes and it hurt like all hell. we were dying of laughter because i looked so ridiculous but he felt bad. 

that night we headed to another friends house and i downed a good amount of the vodka he had given me- it made me incredibly sick and i was projectile vomiting all over my friends deck. i apparently passed out outside and someone took a picture of me- eyes ridiculously red and swollen shut, freakishly pale, with minion pajama pants on, and splattered puke in the background. it is a hilariously cursed image so overall 10/10 both the best and worst gift i have ever recieved"

191,"That sounds really nice. Someone whose idea of romantic is simple acts of normal life to make things easy for you, and saying he loves you. I'll take this over any expensive vacation."
192,Random older (late 60s) guy at a cafe made eye contact with me and while looking at me started rubbing his breasts. 
193,"I've been married 10 years, he knows not to touch my sewing corner. First year we were married he tried to clean up and threw out my ""scraps"".

 No. 

No that was a quilt I spend 16 hrs cutting out and stacking in a specific pattern and order! I actually locked him out of our bedroom for a while that evening while I sobbed. In fairness, I was 10 weeks pregnant and the quilt was what I would decorate the nursery around. Some of that fabric I had had for ages, specifically for this.

He doesn't even look at my sewing stuff, he buys me Joann fabric cards and sticks with dishes! "
194,"Lol!  ""He's not dead, just grew up"". "
195,Why on Earth would anyone bring up their ex during sex? This seems like a very poorly calculated move.
196,"A guy who bullied me in elementary and early middle school (nothing like, traumatizing, I just had a crush on him and he acted like a jerk about it)  came up to me my sophomore year of high school and said he was sorry for how he acted all those years. He said it wasn't okay, he had been wrong and I didn't deserve that. 

It felt nice actually. A lot of people were mean to me in elementary school so to have someone come up and admit they had been wrong sort of fixed something in me. "
197,"When I met him in person (we had met online years before and we were just friends) and I hugged him. It was the most comforting hug ever and he smelled awesome. Then we had a drink together and the way he was looking at me, I just knew it was going to be a ""thing"". We've been together for 2 years now and I've never been happier. "
198,"When he only cares about his own pleasure. 

I seriously don't understand, I literally get off on my partner's pleasure "
199,"We were dating in college for a year, and we started growing apart a little bit. Mind you, this was my first long, serious relationship, and her third or so. I thought that was it, that we should break up, so I went to her place to do so. As soon as she realized what was happening, she immediately broke down into tears. I don't think I truly realized how much she loved me and cared about me until that moment, which made me love her even more. And, it's not like I was excited to break up or anything, I was truly hurt, but I just didn't know how to handle it at the time. We've been together for over 7 years, married for 2, and expecting a girl next year!"
200,"7.5 years ago I set my desktop background to a picture of me and several coworkers at a company volunteer event.  In the picture, he and I were standing pretty close to each other and he looked super cute and happy. The picture made me smile every time I saw it.  Over time I would randomly minimize my windows just to check him out hahah. (I’m a dork, I know).


Now we’re married and having our first baby!"
201,"&gt;Then when I found out he was literally teaching himself Italian just so he could use it with my family

I found my boyfriend's Russian textbook hidden in his sock drawer. Now I'll sometimes write a fake word in the notes I leave myself around the house just to really confuse him if he tries to read it."
202,"I love the part where it gives us an option to shave.

""If ever""

This is my favorite ad &amp; now I'm going to only buy razors from them.

Edit: holy crap they're affordable! $9 to get started (handle + 2 cartridges), then 4 refill cartridges for $9 when you need them. Plus free shipping. www.mybillie.com"
203,"It was all part of his plan:

Step one: move stuff 

 Step two: woo her with Ikea construction skills

Step three: get married

204,I literally just woke up and now I'm sad I just wanna go back to sleep. How dare you have such a cute relationship
205,"My now husband originally wanted to design a horrendous-looking engagement ring with multiple stones of different colors.  He thought that since I like color, I would like a colorful ring; but my taste in jewelry is actually *very* simple and minimalistic.  When he showed my friends the design, they thankfully talked him out of it.  They told me about this later.  10 years later, we all still let him take the credit for the simple solitaire ring he ended up getting me."
206,"I've been with my husband for coming up on eight years, four of which we have been married. I've had many many moments where I felt truly loved by him. But one recent experience really solidified how much he loves me and how ingrained into his life I am.

Over Thanksgiving weekend we stayed the nigbt at my sisters house for the first time which is an older house with quorks. We were just about to get into bed and he said ""hey just so you know the light switch is behind the door in the far back corner of thr wall, so you know where it is when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night"" (as I often do). Just the fact that he knew my habits, and cared enough to not want me to have to fumble in the dark at an unfamiliar place made me feel incredibly loved.

I think I cryed from the love. It was better than getting flowers. "
207,"I dated a guy who gave zero fucks that I was on my period and bleeding heavily. I was like ""eeeeeeh it's going to be fucking messy"" but he just did not care.

I ended up ruining his mattress (bled through the towel) and he just bought a new one like it was nbd. I kind of wanted to marry him tbh. He was 38. Adult men are the best. Great sex. Good times."
208,"I was with you initially, but then I was like, ""You'd actually eat a Cadbury egg that came out of you?""  Cuz...I would not do that."
209,"Mine was so bad, and I also had a terrible reaction to isotretinoin, that my dermatologist would call the whole department in to look at me whenever I came in. Even other consultants.

Hearing non-doctors say ""hurr durr have you tried clearasil, why don't you just wash your face"" was one of the worst bits."
210,"A lazy day in bed with cuddles,movies,deep chat ect"
211,"It was the first year where he was making over six figures, he'd received a healthy holiday bonus, and he was bragging about how much he was spending on gifts for me, his family, and his clients that year, because it was the first time we had the money to comfortably afford it. Hooray. One day on his way out of the office, he found earbuds someone had dropped on the floor in the elevator! He'd told me he was getting me new earbuds for Christmas, but these were similar, and he was sure that one of the earphones cutting in and out was ""just a short or something."" What a Christmas miracle! He decided to give himself the new earbuds he'd ordered for me, and he gave me the earbuds he found on the ground, generously offering to let me pick out two rubber caps from his new set so I wouldn't have to use the presumably dirty, presumably filled with another person's earwax ones that came with the floor earbuds that Mr Big Spender had decided was his big fancy gift to me. He laughed at me when I asked why he didn't just turn them in to the lost and found instead, and he was confused why I continued using my crappy old earbuds instead of the floor ones with one malfunctioning earbud. Stuff like this made me chuckle to myself at divorce court when he'd be making the sad eyes at me. "
212,"Just throw those jars in a horse's womb, add some sweat, a little sperm... baby, you got a homunculus goin'."
213,"I’m gonna say... it’s not a chicken egg, it’s technically as edible as a fetus, and you’d probably still have to buy eggs by the dozen at the store. 
I’m loving these follow up questions. "
214,"Proposed 😂 It was literally a dark and stormy night, wind howling around us, bitter rain pelting our faces... we were visiting Chicago and had gone up to the hotel rooftop to check out the view, but there was tall, frosted glass lining the whole perimeter, and my short ass couldn’t see a thing.  My sweet guy gets down on bended knee, screams the big question over the howling wind, and I was so cold and flustered I basically said “yeah yeah sure, whatever buddy, anything that’ll get you to take me back inside”. Mind you, we’d just had a nice, romantic visit to the Sears Tower, and looking back I have no idea why he didn’t propose to me there. I was furious haha. Eight years later, and we laugh about it. "
215,"When he starts to rub your clit just the right way..... but he thinks your moans and “yes, right there”s mean to go faster and harder, lmao "
216,"""Why? Are you going to help pay for the wedding? No? Then, shut the fuck up and mind your business."""
217,Ignorance and having no empathy for other people.
218,I have never felt more represented in the media lmao. Literally only one of my gal pals that has to shave her toes 
219,"Abusive (mentally, physically, sexually). "
220,"Not sure I get the connection between Harry Potter and dead flowers? Are the scrawny flowers supposed to represent the scrawny Harry?
Also a big HP fan 😊"
221,"Even most of the products I see are focused on ""anti-aging."" I'm 21 and trying to get into skincare more seriously, but I have no idea where to start because everything I see seems to be ""anti-aging."" Dammit, I want better skin.

Honestly, I agree with all your other points too. Cosmetics need a full overhaul, but I doubt it'll happen. :/"
222,i didnt read ex initially and the more i read this the more i was like “wtf why is she with this dude” until i went back to the start to check haha
223,"And when you go ‘hang on hang on, not yet’ they look genuinely really confused "
224,Pants with pockets. Big ones. 
225,"Not me, but a friend told me she constantly feels uncomfortable around one of her guy friends when they're out on a night out, as he acts as if they were a couple: wanting to hold her hand and touch her hair etc. He insists it's innocent and he's just acting friendly and doesn't get what the big deal is. He has also sent her chocolates and flowers for her birthday on several occasions, as well as cards and notes you'd expect from your SO. They would all be sweet gestures but definitely makes her feel so uncomfortable as the level of intimacy is just a little bit off."
226,"My very recent ex committed suicide.  I found out in the middle of the night, and, stunned amd not wanting to be alone with my thoughts, started calling numbers. I needed to speak to someone - anyone. He picked up the phone and listened to me sob and scream into the phone. I was freaking out, as my ex and I had broken up only a few days before, and I had spoken to him earlier that day. Anyway, I realized how late it was and started to apologize for waking my friend with such crazy news.  He knocked on the door at that moment.  He had driven over as soon as I told him what happened.  Over the course of the next few weeks, he was there for me and a perfect gentleman about it to boot.  We became best friends and eventually started dating.  We've been married 6 years now, and have a family."
227,He's trying to find his Cinderella.

230,"Fuckin shit those people, ""eat less spicy food, eat less chocolate"" ya I'm taking the pill which can deform a fetus, fight me"
231,"Same. Even if it's relatively new, I'll take it out (despite the fact that it involves removing a dry tampon). I just feel like if I'm getting clean, I want a clean tampon too.

No judgement to anyone who leaves it in, though. I've always just instinctively taken it out."
232,"Three years ago one of my best friends, A, cut me and our other best friend, H (we were a trio) off with no explanation whatsoever. In fact we had just gotten back from a fantastic weekend visiting each other, drinking and dancing and having a great time. She messaged us and said she no longer wanted us in her life and that she would no longer be talking to us. Cue radio silence for 2.5 years. 

We were deeply hurt and confused. We could not come up with any kind of explanation for her behavior. We tried talking to other people that knew her and got nothing. Now, in the few months leading up to this, A had gone through some really fucked up shit, and we had tried to be the best possible friends to her, and thought we were doing an okay job. After this severance, we felt a lot of pain and confusion for a long time, going through grief and sadness and anger and all that good stuff. I thought I’d gotten over it but every once in a while it would just make me really sad and I’d cry. 

Earlier this year she was in our hometown where I was living and she reached out to me via text, basically groveling and saying that I had no obligation to even respond, but she was in town and would really like a chance to make up for her behavior and apologize and explain. I was a little taken aback but I mean, this girl had been my best friend for 6 years, and I missed her, so I said sure. 

We met up and she told me that she had been diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder right around the time she cut us off. She was also dealing with a lot of PTSD from the shit that had happened to her. She didn’t want to burden us with her mental health, but she also thought we didn’t believe her about what had happened to her. She was also dating a horrible, awful abusive guy and though we had tried to help her out of the situation many times, she was so deep in that she resented us for not liking him. When she reached back out to me they had broken up, and she was on good medication and therapy for her mental health. She was in a much better place and still is to this day. 

I wanted to cry when she told me all this. I felt awful that she hadn’t felt that she could come to us with problems and that we would be a support system for her no matter what. She sincerely apologized for hurting us, and though it took more time before we all got back to the way we used to be, we’re now close friends again.  We’ve all grown up a lot and our friendship is stronger than ever. I’m so glad to have her back in my life. "
233,"So, an average shit then?"
234,That’s messed up. Did you tell your boyfriend? 
235,"Did he have any reason to believe you wanted this? Like wtf? Plus even if you did it's kinda a gift for both of you, not just you.  Plus also like... just what?!?  I'm sorry you cried, but I'm laughing at this now so I hope you are too!"
236,That reminds me of when I worked as a receptionist at a car dealership in college . I was 22 and this Pervy man who was probably in his 50’s would say things to me like “my wife is out of town this weekend if you don’t have anything going on” or my personal favorite was when out of nowhere he asked me how I styled myself down below. Was it bare? Or did I leave some hair?. Fucking amazing what some people think is ok to say or do.
237,"back in college, i was dating a guy from my home town which was about 4 hrs away from my school, so he would come visit on weekends when he could.  he was supposed to arrive friday night before valentine's day and we were going to have a fun weekend together.

well, he decides to come earlier in the day than he said he would to surprise me, around noon rather than 6pm.  i had my econ 101 class at that time.  i still don't know what his actual game plan was, but the dude shows up to my TWO HUNDRED person lecture with flowers.  most people would open the door, realize this plan was flawed because the class was gigantic, and leave immediately.  but no, he decides to stand in the back of the lecture hall in the middle of class and says my name loudly, prompting everyone in the hall to turn around and stare at him.  after a long tense silence, someone in the class goes ""uhhh man i think maybe she skipped class today...""

i had indeed skipped class, and was happily eating chick-fil-a and watching netflix in my dorm during while this humiliation was unfolding.  i have never been so grateful to be a slacker, because i can't imagine what i would have felt if i had actually been in class that day and had to get up in front of 200 people and weirdly take flowers from my grand gesture loving boyfriend.  just thinking of it now makes me cringe.

&amp;#x200B;"
238,I’m pretty sure the intent was to make you uncomfortable. He knew what he was doing. 
239,"Oooh--this one I can do! Junior year in high school. Lunch time. The dude I'd been dating for ~month has his PASTOR come to school and deliver a singing telegram to me, with a song he wrote about our 'relationship' and an ask to prom. Cringe. "
240,"Learn to open up completely. Share your emotions, even the things you are embarrassed about. Even the things you think (fear) will negatively impact your partner's opinion of you. If you had a hard time, chances are that you (both?) have not yet taken the time to share your emotions about this with each other and really try to understand what you've been through (together?).

Honestly, this might sound like a cliché, but I recently went through a difficult time myself and I had no fucking clue what opening up emotionally truly meant, until I did it."
241,"Ug. Gross. Have you tried calling him out on it? Asking him to explain?

""I'm sorry, but what do you mean by that?"" and watch him realize that what he said pretty much translates to ""I want to harass you and the only thing stopping me is the risk of losing my job"" "
242,"Last Christmas we were with my family opening gifts, and my SO INSISTED I open his gift last. He was making a huge big deal out of it. When he gave me the box, it was roughly ring-box shaped. I started internally freaking out, thinking he was about to propose. We had been talking about it for a while and dating about 5 years at the time, so it wasn't unexpected.

Open the box, earrings. They were beautiful but DUDE. REALLY?! DONT' GIVE ME A RING-SHAPED BOX ON CHRISTMAS AFTER MAKING A HUGE DEAL ABOUT IT. 

I told him later and we had a good laugh about it."
243,some say he is still looking for his butt Cinderella
244,"Apart from the poop, I never understood the impact of flowers as a guy until a SO began leaving them for me everywhere. 

For me though even better, she would cut hearts into my toast and crack an egg 🍳 on it, then she would have the biggest smile when she brought it over.  I can’t tell anymore if I like the egg-toast better or that smile when she serves it. "
245,Oh the feeling of removing a dry tampon.  I closed my legs a little bit.
246,"Boobs that are real. Not ""no surgery"" but maybe ""a variety of bodies and shapes and sizes that emphasizes that boobs are lots of things, but they're not just semicircles glued to your upper body that resist gravity"""
247,"“...massive, ginger Florence Nightingale” 🤣

This is so sweet though. Love your story!"
248,"No, he didn't respect your decision to say ""no"" in the slightest, that is why your mad... Which is not in anyway irrational. "
249,"- standing too close

- that time on a first date when a guy violently swatted at a little fly with the most angry, vicious expression on his face for a split second. it scared me enough to make me leave"
250,"I don’t wait. I have sex with someone as soon as I know I want to, and they feel the same. That time has ranged from a few hours after I met them to a week or two of hanging out as friends. 

My observation is this: it’s not whether or not you wait, it’s that sex only magnifies what is really there. If it’s only lust, then after the sex the relationship fizzles out quick — and a lot of disappointed people read that as “we had sex too soon.” But it was going to anyway. On the other hand, if the chemistry or connection is deeper than that, it just kicks it up even a notch more. "
251,"Yeah, he’s just a big sweetie. He really and truly thought I’d love his efforts to get everything in one place. Now he asks before he changes or moves anything in the kitchen because he’s starting to get that I have a method to my madness haha."
252,That's why you sell them to people who would eat it.

254,It's for snuggles and to feel like you're at home. So 100% never a first date seating arrangement 
255,"Do not sit down. If I have things I have to get done, I do them immediately. Once I sit, I'm done. "
256,"My ex surprised me with a very pretty custom made music box that plays the song Chim Chim Cher-ee from Mary Poppins. Chim Chim Cher-ee doesn’t hold any special significance for me at all. I’m pretty sure I had never mentioned that song even in passing.

So he spent considerable money on a custom music box but didn’t think to find out what songs I actually really love (You Are My Sunshine is my favorite music box friendly song and he could pretty easily have found that out...). At the time I told him I loved the gift and even now I think it really is a beautiful music box. I’m just baffled about his thought process that made him decide “Yes. This is the song she will want to hear every time she opens this box.”

It was just...weird..."
257,oh he definitely has I can assure you
258,That's really sweet! I'm glad to hear you two are happy and that he owned up and did whatever he could to make up for it!
259,"We always joked about it for sure but he knew damn well I wasn’t going to actually stick a huge long beaded silicon rope up my asshole. We had a few toys but nothing to do with the ass. Never had anal or anything. Anyway, I think he realized how genuinely excited I was and hesitated to give it to me but how could I not be excited? He talked it way up! We broke up a month ago but that was last Christmas. He still had it in the top of his closet wrapped last I saw lol. "
260,"I think all writers spend too much time associating looks wifh personality. I.e. The pretty girls are always popular and mean, the gothy girl is the smart but introverted one, the heavy girls get picked on and on and on. My experience wasn't like that at all. Our valediction was gorgeous and friends with everyone and one of our gothy girls was an amazing basketball player. Maybe the stereo types are done to save time but they aren't true in my experience."
261,Plus that's just uncomfortable to have to turn your neck the whole time to talk to them. Especially when you're eating. Never understood why couples sit on the same side of the table. 
262,what the FUCK 
263,"I once had a guy put his fingers inside me and just started vibrating them haha! It felt weird and unpleasant. He later said 'I have this trick that women love, where I vibrate my fingers' and i was like 'I know and I'm not keen on that'. I hope nobody else has had to endure that experience lol"
264,"And then when you have your first kid, it's when are you having another?  and so on for perpetuity. After my 2nd (both girls) people were asking me if we were going to try for a boy.  When I said ""my OB-GYN said another pregnancy may kill me"" they shut up real fast.  People need to MTOB and stay in their lane. "
265,How about a fragrance commercial that makes the slightest bit of sense?
266,that split second moment their eyes shift focus from your face to your breasts and back to your face whilst in a conversation. The fact that it seems to happen so 'naturally' really throws me off groove a little every time.
267,What was he thinking? “SHIT! I forgot to go Christmas shopping for my wife. Better hit up Costco.”?
268,lmao truth
269,Attempts to spell the alphabet with his tongue.
270,"When you're on your period: ""I'll just go in your poophole! Nothing gross there!"" "
271,"Oh God the secret's out guys, pack it in."
272,Sounds super cheesy/cliche (especially as it mostly turned out fine) but coming out. It’s enabled me to live the life I want with the woman I love who makes me happier than I thought I could be!
273,"My boyfriend made me a romantic dinner for Valentines Day. Candles, a bear, chocolate, flowers, my favourite salad, it was the best date ever. Though we got to the main meal.  


Me : ""So, what's for dinner babe?""  


Him : ""Steak and chips with peas babe.""  


I'm vegetarian.  
Which he knew. Least I ate a salad and the dessert."
274,The worst is when you accidentally peed on it and forgot you need to pull it out 
275,"Ovarian cyst rupture — worst pain of my life — put me in the ER. This coincided with having fucked up MAJORLY with my now-fiancé, literally in the ER. He didn’t mention it, nor did he make me feel bad for it. Instead, he wheeled me around in the wheel chair, helped with registration, put blankets on me/took them off with the hot and cold flashes, helped adjust my monitors and IV (BP, HR, ECG, SPO2, etc.) as I moved, talked to medical staff, tried to keep the mood light despite his own medical anxiety, sung to me, held my hand. He couldn’t have been more selfless. Had he left me in the ER by myself that night, it would’ve been totally understandable and deserved. But he didn’t. I realized then how much he truly loved me and that I could never fully deserve his love for me. "
276,"My husband and I have a silent agreement...if we offer something up that the other doesn't want...if it is turned down twice, the third no comes with the right to slap said offering out of each other's hands.
Yes I'm serious and yes it's happened.
So that's what I suggest going forward because it really gets a point across"
277,"He told me about some hard times in his past and all I could think of is how I wanted to go back in time to protect him, so nothing bad happens to him ever. We've been together for almost 2 years now."
278,"At least it’s that- I thought it was headed to the “He got our anniversary date wrong” direction. Still though, I have a dress my husband picked out and I’ve never worn “because it’s just not the right occasion” so I feel your pain. It’s been 4 years and it “still hasn’t been the right occasion”"
279,LOL I was at the supermarket the other day and a guy giving out beer samples kept harassing me. Every time I walked by he’d try to get me to have some but I don’t like beer. He said “but do you like blueberries? It tastes like blueberries! And pie!” And then at some point started dancing bizarrely and I was so uncomfortable and tried to get away that I knocked my cart into the wine display and knocked over a bunch of bottles. And he STILL was trying to sell me his beer!
280,"An address to use. It is so difficult to do something without an actual address. I was helped immensely by a guy who let me use his home address as a mail drop. I was suddenly able to claim benefits, apply for jobs and a plethora of other things. Changed my life and quite possibly saved it. "
281,"After I showed a guy at my workplace how to do a task, he whined at length that he couldn’t do it because “[he] just doesn’t have [my] petite, delicate hands that are so naturally good at making beautiful things.” He even mentioned my cuticles at one point? 

We were folding pamphlets. :/ "
282,He never had to do that with his pillows though.
283,"He asked me to come over and help him hang up his new curtains. He had feelings for me and I knew it, and the curtains were being hung up in the bedroom, so looking back on it I think he was hoping to transition it to something else. At the time I didn't realize it though. There was this moment where I had to step back to judge the straightness of the curtain and I looked at him and thought ""oh wow."" And a few minutes later we both sat on the bed and I found myself gazing into his eyes thinking about how I could kiss him right then and there and it wouldn't be wrong. Nothing happened, but a few nights later I replayed the events in my head and realized that I was laying awake at night thinking about him. Made my move a week later and we've been together for eight years now with a baby on the way :)"
284,"That he thinks sex just means penis-to-vaginal sex, and doesn't have confidence doing anything else. "
285,Being overly needy - I want a SO not a child/pet
286,"Maybe men in toothpaste ads.. And, tooth paste ads to not be so.. fake with that over do creepy smile. "
287,"My boyfriend at the times father did this playing touching thing (cannot even remember specifics) that instantly freaked me out. It was in front of everyone, so no sketchy intentions. What I realized it was the same playfulness and mannerisms  my boyfriend had except I interpreted it as flirty with him but it was so unsettling from his father."
288,"Buying a house by myself, with my own money I saved up. It’s been 1.5 years and I’m still quite pleased with myself. "
289,My sobriety. 
290,"There's more than one for me, but I could never accept a SO who was judgmental/critical toward me.

There are enough people out there who criticize and judge others. Nobody needs that from a SO. People need to know their SO has their back. Yes, your SO can point out your mistakes, but that should be done gently and thoughtfully and as part of a productive discussion. I grew up in a house where my father constantly put my mother down and then complained that she wasn't more affectionate toward him. He always claimed he was ""just teasing,"" but he'd regularly reduce her to tears. I purposely avoided even becoming friends with people who were like that later."
291,At least he put the condom on the right way.  Gotta give him points for that. 
292,"OH MY FUCKING GOD.  I have a guy who I just hired, who does not know how to wait until someone is done talking.  I will be mid sentence and explaining how to do something and he'll start talking over me.  I am the manager, there are two other women here and then him and he does it to all of us.  He was also trying to push my ladies around to get us to do things the way he wanted or he was used to them having done.  I attempted to rectify the situation, but It got so bad the owner (a male) had to tell him that he was to respect what the women in the office are telling him to do, most of us have more experience to him, and he answers to me, so if I tell him to do something, that is the way he is to do it.  

The talking over me thing though, is the most infuriating thing in the freaking world.  I've actually just taken to talking louder when he starts interrupting me until he stops talking.  basically like this:

""What I would suggest, is to take this ren... *""well what I'm used to doing...""* DERING AND MAKE SURE THAT (he stops talking) it is compatible with the systems.""  (this is a mild example.  Sometimes I get a full two sentences in before he realizes I'm not done talking)"
293,"I want the color pink to be nowhere on ""women's products"". "
294,"Oh, I have a story where I accidentally used the words ""penetrative intimacy"" during a mock patient interview. It was bad."
295,"It was sexual education week, and we had to talk with mock patients. Let's just say that we should never be allowed to talk about sexual health with patients.

We had a debrief afterwards (this was with the profs and a group of classmates, so technically this was with a prof) where the prof said ""[we] were using 'intimacy' too often and it was confusing"". I was like ""that's BS"" so I offered to do a mock interview in front of the group. 

We have a little small talk, and then I started off with:

&amp;nbsp;


Me: So are you and your SO intimate?

Prof: What do you mean intimate?



&amp;nbsp; 

So at this point I freeze and go:

&amp;nbsp;

Me: Uh, penetratively?

&amp;nbsp;

And I shit you not, I tried to clarify what I meant and followed it up by:

&amp;nbsp;

Me: Uh, coitus?

&amp;nbsp;

Let's just say the group couldn't stop laughing for a couple minutes straight. And I have a certificate to commemorate that moment."
296,Omg yes. I used to think I could hold my own and fight off any potential attacker’s easily. Play fighting/tickle attacks made me realize how much stronger men can be. Definitely scary. 
297,I see someone else here is worthy of wielding the poop knife.
298,"Had a guy hold his hand on my face and stare into my eyes while singing ""She looks like sex"" by Mike Posner... Cringiest experience of my life so far.  "
299,"Walking along the same road as me at night. 

He was just an ordinary guy going about his day and didn’t mean me any harm.

But I’m sure most women would agree that having a stranger walking near them at night would put them on high alert. "
300,Shaving just my ankles because I roll my skinny jeans up haha
301,"When guys try to do “romantic first dates” and ask to get you in a private situation, like “cooking you dinner at his place” or “a quiet picnic in the woods.” They think it’s super cute and impressive to do something unique for a first date, but it makes it seem like they’re trying to get you alone so they can do something creepy. Best intentions, I’m sure, but there’s a very good reason why dinner and a movie is the classic first date."
302,"This same thing happening to me. I hooked him up with a good friend of mine, they slept together and I was so jealous . Took that situation to realize I had feelings for him. We stayed together 9 years but unfortunately it didn’t last . No regrets tho. "
303,"Yeeess. I grew up with parents like that, I don't need that in a relationship. Actually, my parents are the reason I'm afraid of relationships, their own is messed up and they manage to mess up any relationship someone around them has. "
304,"That's really nice. It sucks that she couldn't just understand that some people are just having a tougher time than her and to accept it at face value, but I'm still really glad she did eventually realize he awful she'd been. "
305,"We were going to attend a wedding last summer and I were to wear a dress. I have a small bust which I was particularly self-conscious about when wearing the dress (I felt nothing fit me and it just looked horrible on my boyish figure). My bf was convinced it would help if I got myself a good bra (never owned one), so he wanted to go get one with me. I said ok.

My bf had pulled an all-nighter prior to that day, so he was absolutely knackered and his brain not in optimal condition, lol.

Anyway, we walk into the lingerie shop and the very nice clerk asks what she can help with. Shy and slightly embarrassed as I am, I hesitate to answer, and my bf jumps in straight away!
I forget his exact words, but it was something to this effect:

""We would like a bra for her, because as you see, she doesn't have much chest, so we'd like something that could give done fill.""
I sooooo regret not remembering it exactly!

Anyway, I was short of mortified, but he did it with the best of intentions, lol!"
306,"Having traveled alone at 24. Coming from a small town in India, this was a BIG deal. Best two months ever !!"

309,"When the protagonist is a cool girl who is smart, competent, and can keep up with the boys, and EVERY other woman in the series can't. Drives me up the wall the whole heroine is the exception to the girls suck rule. I see this so much in books for girls and I think that it really contributes to the perception that women need to compete with each other. "
310,So sorry about your dad ♥ ♥ lost mine recently as well and this reminded me of my partner
311,"I don't think there really is one thing, plenty of guys who don't have much experience have been amazing. It's just how much they care for you're satisfaction that matters, experience is as pointless as size. "
312,"34yo. Lost my job. lost my house. Lost my best friend. Lost my wife. Lost my car. 

36yo. New house. new career. New car. Kids are doing great in school. Healthy and all that. 

Two years ago I was sleeping on my dad's couch. Wondering how I was going to feed my babies. 
I doubled my retirement savings this year. I bought a new car. I when back to school and got 2 B's and an A. I quit smoking. I stopped drinking. I think often I need  to go to church but school keeps me busy. my empoyer supports my educational goals, and my philosophy of good design and sustainability. I can see me being engaged, challenged and deeply satisfied in my current career for a long time."
313,"It would be nice if advertisers would stop trying make people insecure about themselves and stop trying to guilt or shame people into using their products. It won't happen, but it would be nice."
314,You assume calculations were made. 
315,"&gt; don’t start jamming a fingernail under the hood

Oh my God, I felt that when I read i just now.  My legs are now crossed and won't be uncrossing for a very very long time."
316,Most realistic story here 
317,"Still pretty early on in our relationship and we're still college students but I have pretty bad anxiety and some trauma triggers (which sometimes leads to depressive episodes that can last a few weeks) and I lose my appetite then, which then makes me feel nauseous, and then I can't sleep, etc etc it's a nightmare cycle. Once I felt super nauseous going to bed and he stayed up all night with me and massaged my hand the way his Korean grandmother does because apparently there's pressure points there that take away headaches.

&amp;#x200B;

The past 3 weeks have been absolute hell for me and I've cried pretty much every single day, broke down a few times on public transport and all that, yet he's ever patient, kind and gentle. He tells me all the time that he just wants the best for me, that it will be okay, etc. We're both back in our home countries for the holidays now and right before I boarded my flight he texted me a long paragraph to say that he loved me and that he hopes when we see each other again in the new year we'll both be happier people.

&amp;#x200B;

He does a lot more for me, but these are just moments where it hit me really hard that I'm receiving the most genuine kind of love. I've had a truly shitty 2018 but his presence feels like a gift to me, from a higher being who felt a bit bad for me lol. I love this boy, and I hope I can do the same and more for him."
318,"I once had a SO give me $100 pen for my birthday. I was broke in college and waiting tables. They thought I could use a fancy pen to take orders. I can't remember exactly what I said, but basically I asked if I could return it and buy something else. That never happened and he took the pen back and gave it to his mom.

Edit - added reaction. 
"
319,"Periods.  Republicans would legally require me to stay at home until I laid my daily egg, then sit on it in case it hatches.  "
320,"&gt; I leave my phone in my purse

This part is crucial for me because once I start, especially going through social media or reddit there is no escape from that. Before I know it so much time has surpassed and I'd make excuses to procrastinate the task to the next day. :/"
321,I can see a history buff enjoy that though. You're literally walking through a major historical site of the last century!
322,"Recently a work supervisor came up behind me and adjusted my clothes because ""my shirt was riding up."" He didn't tell me why he was touching my clothes until after he had adjusted them. "
323,"It reminds me of a comment I read a while back, where the OP hated his gf to touch herself, because it meant ""he wasn't enough"". 
:Eyeroll: 
"
324,"Too much focus on their ~budding sexuality~ but also like... books make girls seem really intention-oriented. 

Why is she wearing that shirt? It's either to get someone's attention OR because she's a TomBoy who Doesn't Care About Clothes OR she's a rebel who hates her school uniform. And in reality no one knows why the fuck they do anything as a teenager. Being a young adult is like 10% intent, 50% routine and the rest is all random chaos. 

I'm wearing this shirt bc my mom bought it for me, it's one of three shirts that match the skirt I want to wear, it hides my period bloat, I slept in it and I'm now too comfy to take it off. I have tons of reasons for doing stuff that have nothing to do with my personality. Books spend so much time explicitly saying ""this is why she did that"" which makes it seem like teenage girls have some agenda or plan for everything. It's just a shirt!"
325,"""OMG! You're a genius! That's brilliant!"""
326,"My boyfriend bought me a men’s jacket for Christmas. I was so confused, I had to ask why. His response:

“You always like wearing my jacket so much, I figured you’d want your own.”"
327,"Last week some cleaning company guy came around my work floor, inspecting the carpet for wear and tear. He just stood by my desk looking at me and the floor for a minute til I said, ""uh, are you looking for someone?"" Of all the things he could have said, he goes, ""oh don't worry, I'm not here to hurt anyone"" and just walks away.

That thought hasn't crossed my mind *until you just fucking said it.*"
328,"I had an ex set up a romantic scavenger hunt that was supposed to end up with me finding her in a hotel room that she had decked out with flowers, champagne, and her dressed all sexy for valentines day. The hunt was basically clues she had left around the house and I had to find each one to proceed to the next.  I find all the clues and the last one has the name of the hotel she was at...with no room number.  I drive the 15 minutes to the hotel (this was in the 90's so no cell phone), get there and ask if they have any reservations under my ex's name.  ""I'm sorry, we can't give out that info.""  I found her car in the lot but because it was general parking but I couldn't even begin to guess which room she may be in.  I eventually ended up having to drive another 10 minutes, find a payphone and call the hotel to speak to her.  They patch me through and she gives me the room number.  It was a crazy amount of time and she even began to wonder if I was going to show up.  It all turned out well in the end and we had a good laugh over it but that was a crazy hoop to jump through for some valentines romance!  "
329,"&gt;hold me by the nape of my neck

That sends shivers down my spine. I always felt the hand on the lower back was very intimate and something reserved for partners but holy fuck, my neck! I have to be in the perfect mood for my *partner* to put his hand there and hold me, no way should anyone else ever touch someone there. I am so sorry someone would do that to you without your consent. "
330,"Argh, I've been there.

I've also been with the opposite: the guy who can't be serious or stoic at all.  I had a moment where I was trying to tell my ex something very, very serious about being depressed and he started giggling (legit giggling) and snorting with laughter in middle because, ""I thought about kittens being in a basket and how cute it would be!""

It was so disrespectful that I just stopped talking and walked away. 

I need a perfect balance of serious/stoicism and goofy/relaxed."
331,Oh no!!!! NEVER reorganize someone else's kitchen. That's sacrilege!
332,"I’m glad you misread the question and shared anyway... this was really great to read. Thank you for sharing that! I know it’s not easy to admit that stuff either, and I definitely admire you for reaching out to others and especially for not demanding they accept your apologies or anything like that. For real, thank you for sharing this! 

Any advice for parents about making sure their kids aren’t bullies? Is there anything your parents could have taught you or done differently that may have helped, or do you think it was kinda just who you were at the time? 
"
333,"I used to work in a lingerie boutique and I can promise you that those sales girls took complete advantage of him. Men in lingerie stores are like lost puppies. They’ll buy anything if you dote on them a little bit and tell them it’s on sale. Also, when asked what size he needs the response is always “well she’s about the same size as you.” Always. I was 6 months pregnant and had men tell me that lol. So the sales woman that was helping him probably just picked out all the stuff that was her size. "
334,"We’d already been together for a couple of years, so I knew already. But after that evening I knew we can conquer everything together.

When I had my wisdom teeth extracted, they removed all 4 of them under general anesthesia. He brought me to the dentist and waited for me.
When I woke up, the first thing I remember is hearing his voice and beeing so glad he was there. 
He took me home and made sure to bring me new cooling packs every 10min. I somehow managed to fall asleep on the couch. After I woke up, I puked all over the coffee table. All the blood I must have swallowed, it was disgusting and I just couldn’t stop. He cleaned everything up, brought me more ice packs, a puke bucket and a heating pad. All of that with the most loving look on his face I had ever seen. 
He just wanted me to get better :)"
335,"It was who I was, but it was also a combination of a lot of factors.  I can only give you some ideas that may have helped in my specific situation.

Pay attention to your kids.  Get involved in their lives, even when they do not know it.  I do not mean snoop through their rooms, but watch their games or their performances, check in on them and their friends, talk to them.

Do not push them too hard.  Give positive interactions that are not about an accomplishment they did.  Ask them for a book or movie recommendation and really follow through.  Talk about it afterwards with them and tell them why you liked it.  Learn what they do for fun and support it just as much as you support their schoolwork, if not more.

Talk to them like they are real people and not props in your story.  They will be less likely to see others as props in their stories then.  Show them you care about them and you care about other people outside of your home.  Show them compassion and empathy.

Set rules and guidelines.  Be smart about this, though.  The super strict rules can backfire if the chafe too much and then they are useless.  Be flexible and reasonable with your rules.  Talk about the rules and listen to what they have to say about it.  

Make sure your kids know they can come to you for help always.  This was a big one I lost.  From the age of 11 and a few months, I knew I was on my own.  If anything came up in my life, I had to deal with it myself.  Be open with your kids, be inquisitive, talk to them about your problems and your solutions.  Let them know that you have their back, be it calling in the middle of the night because they are drunk at someone's house and need a ride to staying up all night helping them with a school project.

My older sister died when I was 11.  She was in high school at the time and everyone loved her.  She was the town sweetheart, in the best possible way.  When I was the only girl left, I was suddenly a painful reminder of what had been lost to my parents.  I was shoved aside and they did their best to forget me.  For my part, I did my best to be the opposite of my sister.  She had her hair long, I had mine short.  She made friends, I made enemies.  She never got in trouble, I was brought home in the back of a police car several times before I was old enough to drive.

I use none of that to excuse who or what I was.  I own my past myself and I refuse to pass off blame to my parents or anyone else.  But, the things above would have helped me, I think.  "
336,What was his reaction?
337,"My ex had a terrible habit of using my money to buy gifts for me because he didn’t have a job. He got me this cheap bracelet from Walmart, some candy, and greeting cards and I got so mad. The gesture was nice but the fact that I paid to get surprised with cheap stuff from Walmart I would never buy, really ruined the meaning. 

I got upset and said “stop buying crap with my money” and he argued back that it wasn’t crap and subsequently tried to make me feel bad for rejecting the gift.

Should have dumped him there before he spent any more of my money. "
338,"\&gt;spent a lot of time grinding against my thigh  

This brought back horrible memories of my teenage-years."
339,"Men talking about random women in a very sexual way, without me asking or it being on topic. Bonus points if said woman has nothing to do with him and never has, or she doesn't even know he exists (like celebrities). 

I now know to stay away from them, because most of the time they 1) have 0 self-control and / or self-awareness and 2) are gross if that's their initial reaction when perceiving a woman, instead of seeing her as just another person first."
340,I hope your initials aren't DNR.
341,💍
342,That sounds like exactly what he was thinking.
343,"Unwillingness to compromise or grow.

My life with my SO is utter chaos and on the brink of complete financial ruin. Despite literally everyone telling me that I need to think about moving back home, I stay with him. Not because I'm being abused, but because every step, every challenge, every obstacle that gets thrown at us, he meets head on and learns and grows from the situation. We barely fight because we communicate so well know that communication is the only way we're going to get out of this mess."
344,"You sound like a badass. I hope you get the job! There's nowhere to go but up. From a 21 year old little lost soul, I'm looking up to you. Happy holidays!"
345,"""Could you please do the sexing better? By the way HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"" "
346,"We just tell them that it's a very long way away.

We've been together for six years, but we're 22 and don't yet live together. In my town, young engagements are very common, and at 18 and after only two years together, we were getting asked why we weren't engaged yet! "
347,"I have an ex that is just absolutely awful at oral. Thinks it should be more like a blowjob, with throaty fake porn gagging noises (wtf are you gagging on?), intense and constant eye contact, the whole nine yards. I tried to correct him early on in the relationship, but he stopped and got offended, saying “this is for me, not you. I know what I’m doing.”

I told him I hated his oral and I had no interest in teaching him after that. He was obsessed with his own dick (I think largely gay to be honest) and specifically blowjobs. Just obsessed. He only took an interest in pleasing me once my interest in giving him head diminished. 

I was out not long after that, being single and enjoying men who actually crave pleasing me as much as I crave pleasing them. What a waste my ex is. I bet he’d give a fantastic blowjob though, if anyone wants to hunt him down and wake him up to who he actually is."
348,"This is going to sound crazy - but the day after we met. 

Some really bad shit was going down in my personal life during our first date. It threw me. We finished out the date, he kissed me goodnight and I figured I'd never see him again because of that drama. 

Instead, he texted me the next day and asked how I was doing. He then told me he was bringing me over dinner and a movie that night because he didn't want me to have to be alone with all of this going on.

He owed me nothing, hardly knew me, yet wanted to be my safe space. That's love. "

350,"I dated a guy who I caught in a lie about cheating. He told me that he was hacked, he blamed me for not trusting him, and yelled at me about how we're beyond trust issues. Pretty sure if we still spoke he'd blame it on Russia 😂"
351,That is horrifying. 
352,"Can you imagine a man who’s in love with his woman having to deal with this?  Like, From his perspective the c section was probably horrifying. Maybe he couldn’t believe you had to go through all that to have his child. I bet he wished he could have taken on that burden but since he couldn’t, cleaning up a little blood was the least he could do. Many people don’t know what hell it is to go through a c section. That first time you stood up probably felt like all your guts were going to fall out and the pain is excruciating. I’m grateful, though, that we live in the time we do so families like yours can have a happy ending to the birth process. "
353,"My dad is infamous for stuff like this.  ""Ah yes, this household object represents the larger, real present that I just don't have yet!"" "
354,"Same, same, same, same. My dad's temper never got better - it only got worse with age. In any new relationship, I will bail at the first sign of a bad temper. People say that ""fighting is healthy for a relationship and if you don't fight, you don't love each other."" Bullshit. My last 3 year relationship never had any huge fight, just several disagreements that we talked and sometimes cried through, and in some cases even agreed to disagree, but never once started yelling obscenities and low blows at each other. This is the bar I will hold all my relationships to. "

357,"On my birthday this year my ex got me a cake. My ex knows I don’t like cake. So he took his daughter to a bakery, she picked out her favorite kind of cake and they special ordered that. 

I know it doesn’t sound like a big deal but it honestly really hurt my feelings that instead of getting me a type of dessert I would have actually liked for my birthday he pretty much got a cake for his daughter that said happy birthday on it because he thought I had to have a cake because it was my birthday. "
358,"Work in mostly male environment. My BOSS said to me one day while in the break room ""you're eating again?!?"" I can usually filter myself at work but this time I came out with ""what the fuck is that supposed to mean?"" His face got red as he realized what he said. Thankfully another coworker was also in the room and said ""you should watch how you say things to women.""  I haven't received any backhanded comments since then. "

360,"That’s awful. In pubs sometimes older guys will literally put a hand on each of my shoulders and shift me to the side, because I’m little I guess. If I’m drunk I’ll snap at them with “don’t touch me” but often I’ll just say “oops sorry” :/ "

363,"I just called off a relationship with a guy because of this. Not so much flaky, but made no time for me. He would tell me that his constant working was so he could “create a good future for us.” How are you going to build a future with me when you cannot be bothered to make time to hang out? I’d literally be lucky to see him once a month. "
364,Quote of 2018.
365,"When giving Christmas presents to his nieces and nephews, he wrote that they were from both of us. It was still a very new relationship, and I was surprised that he had already included me as part of the gift-giving even though he had completely purchased the gifts. 

We’re married now and I asked him when he knew that I was “the one.” He said it was our third date when I went to hold his hand while we walked down the street. He said it just felt so comfortable and right. 

It took me longer to know he was the man I wanted to marry because I was younger and less experienced with relationships. But I remember we were driving somewhere and talking about our relatives. Despite his stoicism, I could feel how much he loved the people he shared this world with. And I knew I loved him truly and deeply in that moment."
366,"How many years? In early high school a couple of girls I was close with suddenly ghosted me and then wrote things about me on the walls in the bathrooms and then fought with me online etc. I was really hurt at the time but ended up getting over it. A few years later, in the second last year of high school one of them gave me a sincere apology and we ended up good friends. The other never spoke to me again. They weren’t friends anymore either. A couple of years after this, the girl I was friends with again and I had some deep conversations and I realised the things she was dealing with at the time that she’d treated me horribly. It didn’t make it okay but I could see that at ~13 she had a lot of awful and pain in her life, and didn’t know how to cope. I had some really awful things happen too so I could empathise in that way. It’s 10 years later and she’s a really beautiful person who I’m really proud of and really glad that she apologised to me when she did and we became friends again. "

370,"It was a slight feeling of jealousy.  We'd been part of a group of friends for about 2 years and I remember feeling suddenly jealous at him giving attention to another of our friends.  Then I had an X rated dream about him. Never told him at the time,  of choose.  Then we went to a concert,  a totally common occurrence,  but for some reason it felt a little like a date.  Anyway,  that was over 10 years ago and we've been married 6+ years now."

372,"My girlfriend has very little experience w/ sex in a relationship &amp; the relationship she had young led her to believe this IS what sex should be (jack hammering, finger blasting, rough only for the mans enjoyment). So her years after the relationship any sex partners she had she asked them to be like that with her.. but she really doesn’t enjoy it. 
It’s very hard to get across that I’m extremely happy to touch her how she wants to be touched, and to spend time getting her off. I think it’s hugely beneficial to know how she would touch herself but it’s hard for her to communicate that because she thinks she should just lay there and get plowed.
I feel bad that her perspective is limited by those experiences"

378,"Ah... I thought outside of the bedroom. I was going to say: 

lots of bragging, especially about porn-like sounding stuff. 

Being uncomfortable discussing women's bodies – not their aesthetic or bodily functions but everything involving them. E.g Saturday I made a joke about how stupid the names of different pills were and there were only physics students in their 20ies and they all seemed perblexed I'd mention the unmentionable and looked at their feet. 

Thinking they can seduce women into casual sex. Maybe there's some actual ""players"" out there who think they can. But in my experience it's probably the more unexperienced ones who will take rejection for hook ups personally, think you can talk a woman into casual sex and inquire online on ""tricks"" how to do that."
379,"Actually really liked that, they didn’t over do it and the message is clear, very impressive."
380,"Be mindful of one another. Be consistent. Instead of saying ""you never"" or ""you always"" replace it with the ""I feels"". Repsect and listen to each other. Always have date nights, picking one day out of the week to get together and do something nice even if you're not spending money. Remind each other how much you guys love one another. Hugs, kisses, cuddles and skin to skin contact. Spend time together. Cook together and all sorts of other stuff :)"

But at one point he said something along the lines of, ""oh man, when we have sex, my penis is going to reach all the way back to the back of your uterus/your ovaries!"" 

I tried to explain to him that that was not how the vagina worked. He assured me repeatedly that that absolutely was how it worked. 

His penis was going to reach all the way to my ovaries."

Hopefully next year I can move out. 

I’ve also started dating for the first time, it’s been longer than I thought to find someone. Had a couple almost relationships but weren’t quite right, and some more first dates... I used to be super shy and I still feel pretty awkward meeting people but I’m doing it! And I’ve done all this without having real friends there for me. I’m kind of upset about them, but I’m also joining a social league next year so maybe I’ll make some good friends too.

389,"I love that commercial. I remember seeing it first on instagram several months ago and there were countless men commenting how revolting it was. They were so butthurt and incel-like, saying that women who have hair will never get men and other nonsense similar to that. Wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. I just assume all these boys are baby smooth all over if they expect us to be. Even some women were saying it's disgusting. I don't care whether anyone shaves, why they care so much as to insult other people is beyond me. "
390,I love that commercial because it doesn't make a big deal about dad doing the laundry. It's treated as a completely normal thing and he talks about it the same way all the moms in the other commercials talk about it.
391,"Guys that try to be badass by telling stories of violence that they enacted. It feels theatening. Like they want you to know they can beat you at any moment for the smallest possible issue they have with you. Its honestly scary. I've had guys that are close friends do this kind of thing and it made me stop talking to them because it scared me. I don't want to hang around someone that is ""badass"" in that way.

Edit: Just remembered something else. Calling me babe, baby, sweetheart, honey, hun, or any variation of what I would call a petname without knowing me well or getting my permission. I know sometimes its a cultural thing, but it just fees degrading to be told something like, ""Sweetheart, calm down."" Fuck you too, *sweetheart*."
392,"I saw a bunch of Billie ads in a subway station the other night, and a girl behind me was complaining to her boyfriend about how ""gross"" they were. I heard her say that ""no woman's toes are that hairy, they must have used a man."" It's a HAIR REMOVAL CAMPAIGN. The person is REMOVING THAT HAIR. Some women have dark hair on their toes, but you don't see it because they choose to shave it. The judgment was insane. Since the station was so crowded, I heard her scoffing at the huge picture of a hairy leg being shaved as well. I wanted to turn around and ask her how often she does the exact same thing that was grossing her out so much."
393,"It depends on the guy and the situation.

Did he ask me out and his answer to my split suggestion was ""Nah, I've got this, I'm the one who asked you out so I'll pay."" and no expectations from me to do anything in return, then fine.

If he is all ""Imma a man, I will pay! Now you give me sex!"" then no."
394,"(Now ex) bf and I met while studying in Germany. I left to go back to the UK, he still had a few more months there until Christmas.

Went back to Germany with a friend from home to visit bf and other friends a week or so before Christmas. We’re flying into Hamburg 2.5 hours by train to Hannover where we studied (no direct flights went to Hannover for us). Ex tells friend and I that we should pack one dressy outfit for a surprise. Hmm okay. 

Land in Hamburg, get told not to get the train to Hannover, instead go to Hamburg city centre, get changed in the bathrooms of the train station and they will meet us there. Bf and other friends show up. 6 of us in total now (me, bf, home friend and 3 other friends). 

Surprise is they booked us tickets to see Phantom of the Opera! Wow thats great, I’ve never seen it before and neither has my friend from home. Go to the theatre. Realise the show is in German. Only me and one other person in our group speak German. Out of the other 4, 2 have seen the show so can somewhat follow the plot but the other 2 have no idea what is going on. 

Then, to top it off. Bf didn’t realise how long the show went on for. If we stayed for the whole show, we would miss the last train back to Hannover and the next one wasn’t till 4am. It’s December, freezing and we have suitcases so staying in a bar till then isn’t really an option. We decide to leave the show at the interval and take the last train back. It was a sweet gesture but I felt so bad he spent good money on those tickets and train fares only for nobody to enjoy the show. 

Also, the next day he had booked a brewery tour for 4 of us and it was also in German so I had to translate for the other 3 the whole time. "
395,"My high school boyfriend lived next door to the morning drive-time DJ on a station for country music, which I listened to sometimes back then, but he did not. Since he had no idea what I liked, he asked my mom, who is also clueless about country music. She told him one song that she knew she’d heard me singing along to, but had apparently never really listened to carefully. He had his neighbor dedicate a song to me on the radio on the morning of my birthday.

It was a break-up song. (For the curious, Garth Brook’s “The Dance.”)"

400,"Guy I went to middle school with reached out to me and a bunch of girls I’d been friends with back then. He was a bully to us girls but we thought it was just his way of flirting. He was cute so everyone brushed it off. When we’d be outside, he’d gather up a handful of grass and come up behind me and shove it in my mouth and then hold my mouth closed. He’d spit in our faces. Fun things like that. We were all secretly a little bit afraid of him. 

He didn’t follow us to high school, I never really gave him more thought over the years. When he reached out it was totally out of the blue. Girls I hadn’t talked to in years messaged me asking if he’d reached out to me too. I never responded to him, I just didn’t care. 

He was in the news a few years ago, got busted for being part of a sex trafficking ring for underage girls. He’s still behind bars. Glad I never gave that POS my forgiveness. "
401,"I want commercials to stop assuming women all want the same things, in a really patronizing way. ""When a woman finally gets that ring..."" uhh is that what all women are working toward? An engagement ring? Wow women must be shallow. "

403,I just flashed back to teenage years so fast I got a whiplash
404,I think we all need to work together to stop tickling when it makes people uncomfortable and stand up when it’s happening to others. For some reason I think it’s a cultural thing in the US that tickling is fine. I have had to stick up for my kids so many times that when they say no to tickling it means no. I’ve even had people tell me stories about how funny it is they make their kids pee because they won’t stop tickling them! Not ok! Just because it’s fun for you doesn’t mean it’s fun for other people!

414,"OP, the most wonderful, empathic, resilient people I know have been through the absolute worst, most desolate periods in their lives. They choose to use these as transformative springboards, which switches them out of victim perspective and into power-self-sufficiency perspective. 

I’ve been through hell, and while it was all painful, embarrassing (I’m supposed to be winning at life, damnit!), debilitating and brought me close to destruction, it was ALSO: the greatest gift  I’ve received. Reaching the limit of my coping allowed me to break through that, and come out more empathetic, focussed, determined and wise. I wouldn’t change it.

Currently 36, but back when I was 29 I was building the ‘goal life’ with a fiancé, nice townhouse in a lovely area, and a great career as a performing musician and educator, talking marriage, weddings, kids and life. 

Cue turning 30 with a bunch of autoimmune diseases that hit me hard enough to leave me unable to walk. I went from being an extroverted A-type singer/musician, in gym every day with my hot fiancé, to gaining 30kg within 3 months, sleeping all the time, in big pain and nearly totally disabled.

I got walking with pain and difficulty 3 months after my body shut down, and when the Drs said it would take me 3 years to walk again properly, my fiancé noped outta there fast,

I lost my performing career, a large portion of my teaching job, my man, my home, my hot body, plus ALL my savings while looking into every healing strategy I could - both eastern and western medicine. I lost religion in this process but gained a profound respect for spiritual connection. 

Moved out of spacious townhouse into tiny garden cottage, and was utterly wellness-focused and determined. I was walking again in 6 months’ (by which time my ex fiancé did a 180 and wanted to ‘try again’. I was happier staying friends forever and done with his ass).

Got super focused on music-Education, and took a job running a music Dept. Slowly got out of debt, and bought myself a beautiful house, by myself, 2 years’ ago! Building a music studio inside (yay!) Back into performing this year for the first time. 

I got the white picket fence, and I didn’t need a man to do it. I did it myself, and this is something I’m so proud of."

He tried to get me suspended because he kept tickling me one day after I told him to stop and I was just so fucking done. I grabbed his thumb, twisted around, and sprained his stupid wrist while yelling “DO IT AGAIN AND I’LL BREAK IT OFF” 

Apparently that was “too far” and he threw a tantrum till the principal was about to suspend me, which is where I shrugged and said “then I’m filing charges against him and against the school for letting him continue to harass female students. Teachers have told him to knock it off but he was never punished so I don’t feel safe here.”

I had no idea if that would work or anything but I figured threatening to get a lawyer might make them decide to take this seriously. I shouldn’t have to get physically violent to keep some jackoff from touching me when I said to stop. "

Specifically, his mom noted that I was the first girl he’s ever introduced to his parents before (although I know he’s had plenty of girlfriends before me). This made me realize how naturally two lives can merge together if they really love each other.

I was basically going to work, going home, sleeping, going back to work, for a month.

In the middle of it, my wife asked me what I wanted to do when this whole thing was over, and I sent her a photo I'd taken on a snowed in day the year before, of a glass of boxed wine, Taco Bell, and Minecraft on my computer screen.  She was so good and nice, and for the last few weeks of the project whenever I got down, she'd be like ""3 more days until tacos and video games!"" and I just fantasized about being able to have no responsibilities, just silence and guilt free video games.

I don't like cheesecake or coffee. It isn't even a ""take it or leave it"" kind of dislike. I think they're both gross as hell. I thanked him and then set them aside ""for later"", figuring my mom or someone would happily fall on that grenade for me. I didn't want to tell him I didn't like them because it was a sweet gesture and he would have taken it personally.
