0,"As someone with large breasts, there's no way a bra without any underwire would provide enough support. "
1," Poor construction, including what seem to be factory errors. Product not suitable for intended purpose.  
Seller unfortunately does not accept returns.  

4 out of 10, would not recommend."
2,"9/10

Daughter of lesbian parents so endured a lot of homophobia as a child (still do now), financially stable upbringing, had a very enriching childhood, dealt with a lot of loneliness and self-esteem issues as a teenager (still sometimes do now), university educated. Lots and lots of love in my life."
3,"In my situation, I know he’s sleeping with other people, we’ve talked about being safe but I’d rather not know who he’s sleeping with, specially if it’s someone I might know. It makes me feel weird about talking to someone knowing we both slept with the same guy recently. Is that weird ?"
4,2 I moved around a lot and never make connections with people
5,"Both my ex and I loved the way each other smelled. Whenever one of us went out of town, we'd swap twice worn shirts to remind us of the smell. "
6,"For me it was therapy and there are therapists out there who specialize in trauma and have a lot of experience with sexual assault. 

The other thing was having a patient, understanding, supporting partner who worked very hard to build up my trust in him. We didn't have sex at all the first year of our relationship and every new intimate thing we did was a big deal. Sometimes it went fine and sometimes I had an anxiety attack and couldn't do that again for another few weeks or months. Sometimes it was fine one time but the next time it wasn't. 

It was hard for both of us but we kept open communication and I had the added support of my therapist to help me navigate what I was going through. 

Also from experience - the one thing that doesn't help is minimizing your experience and trying to brush it off and move on. I did that for 10 years and I thought I was fine. I wasn't fine. And it doesn't matter how much time passes, if you don't face it you can't move forward. "
7,"I am on a quest to find a comfy cotton skirt WITH pockets. I can't stand the constant ""leggings wedgie"" anymore so here we are."
8,Sometimes you used those yesterday and forgot to restock your purse because you were tired last night. 
9,"Maidenform boyshorts. Comfortable, practical, but not granny-like. "
10,Honestly the only thing that would bother me is that I'd be risking a Christmas baby. That's literally the only reason I haven't started trying yet. 
11,"I really like his deodorant. All his shirts take on the deodorant smell and his natural BO smell, which is much nicer and different from the ""I worked out and got disgustingly sweaty"" BO smell. 

I make him wear my hoodies all the time so that they smell like him."
12,How can people be so inhumane? The woman is completely disregarded in every situation you explained. It’s like she’s just a machine and nothing more. 
13,"Good question, but why does anyone like anything?"
14,Probably for the same reasons men like busting in women: to get pregnant or because it feels good. 
15,"AWW YISS STINKY MAN!

He's very good at keeping clean. He doesn't like to smell his own body odor. So, most of the time, he smells like body wash and deodorant.  But every once in a while, I get a whiff of his natural scent, and it nearly knocks me off my feet!

Moving day was great for that. And summer's a good time for it, too."
16,"Friends are people who respect each other and don't take advantage of one another, whom selflessly care about each other's safekeeping and well-being,  whom you would adamantly protect and defend, and whom you would faithfully trust in uncertain circumstances.  
  
A friend doesn't threaten, doesn't harm, and doesn't wrecklessly disregard the best interests of those around them."

18,"For me, it was a combination of significant time and healing and having a caring and supportive partner who was very patient and understanding to be able to enjoy physical intimacy without fear or flashbacks."
19,"Running, I used to hate exercise, now I feel a high from it "
20,"Make it right as best you can, and make sure it doesn't happen again."
21,"I really love my cat. He comes running up to me, all meowing and purring, every time I come home from work, he cuddles up and falls asleep next to me nearly every night, follows me everywhere, and will happily (and loudly) demand attention knowing I can't resist.

30,I have pretty big hands for a guy and I still often find phones annoyingly wide.
31,What does FTB stand for? 
32,"I actually really like the Gilligan and O'Malley brand that they have at Target! They're nice and soft, and fit my butt and crotch very nicely."
33,They would have to be acceptionaly witty in their bio.... But I find intelligence sexy🤷
34,Teaching myself ALS. 
35,You want sources for my claims? Two books. The male brain and The female brain. Dr. Louann Brizendine
36,Watch tv and eat my feelings away
37,"7/10, it’s not too bad, but it could be a lot better. "
38,"As a teen I stayed away as much as possible, mostly going home just to sleep and shower. After I graduated high school, moved out at the first chance I got. Hang in there. Two years may seem like a long time right now, but once you're on the other side you'll see it really isn't."
39,"Cheerful childhood, loud excited early school years, quiet reserved middle school years, and I'm finishing my exciting fun high school years this semester! I'd rate 10/10"
40,My parents 
41,[removed]
42,Why do some men want/like it when they finish inside women?
43,"I think it varies for everyone. In my case a lot of patience and kindness helped. Doing things in your own pace, with a partner that completely understands. A tough thing is for partners who are not familiar with the situation (have not been through it themselves) to even try to understand and remain patient. After an assault it takes so much to even just trust people enough to get close to them, especially physically. 

I still flinch from time to time or get anxies for seemingly no apparent reason, but it gets easier. "
44,"My boyfriends mate, had to tell him it’s not normal to have a few cold ones before you start your work day of driving around doing gardening and maintenance work"
45,I loved Arrival. Amy Adams deserved an Oscar for that one. 
46,"""if I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse"" Holly Black, the Cruel Prince "
47,I am honestly SO jealous! I can’t wait until I have my own land and have at least 5 omg
48,What is it?
49,"Old Navy now makes shirts that have extra hidden buttons sown in around the bust. I'm not a huge fan of them as a brand, but it was one of the few times where I felt like someone made a shirt with my hefty chest in mind. "
50,"Yeah, me too. I'm a 34 DD to a 32 C depending on how much milk I got in my boobs, weight gained etc. My husband bought me the ""bombshell"" which brings the look of my cup size up to 32 F? 


It's marketed as a push-up bra with extra padding to make your boobs looks bigger.  I personally use it as a thick-pillowy-nipple-blocker.  I feel *nothing* when my boobs get accidentally/deliberately rubbed on (this happens a lot with breastfeeding kids, sometime they like to rub/play/twiddle the other nipple while they nurse too.)  I love feeling *nothing*.  It really is the best nipple protector I've found so far. "
51,When someone designs a bar/restaurant with rounded chairs and no under table/bar hooks for purses.   I’m not about to be putting my several hundred dollar purse on the floor.   
52,"It did say it has pockets though... So ya know... Some guy in product management was like ""Yeah girls are always bitching about not having suitable pockets or some shit. Let's put a pocket or two."" 

Ugh the Emojis piss me off as well. As a girl who plays video games I'm disgusted. "
53,Fruit sugars aren’t bad for you 
54,"I love reading but I've found myself in this weird between-genres funk the past few years. I'm too old to read YA novels, even though I used to devour them, but too young for ""adult"" fiction novels. I find that many adult books I read are centered around being married and having kids and having corporate jobs or professional careers and I'm just not at that stage in my life where that stuff is relatable.

I've found some authors I really love, such as Jodi Picoult and Gillian Flynn, but I've already read all of their books. I need to find some good reading for a mid-20's girl!"
55,No.
56,Phrasing
57,"I've never seen it before. I don't have any thoughts on it beyond the fact it is not a font I'd choose for myself, and I don't understand how it could be so emotionally upsetting. It's a font. "
58,They actually do make those but the few extra pennies of cost they probably won't ever catch on. 
59,"It seems like you might want to try a different shape, the cups might be too wide or go up too high. "
60,"Born wedlock, Dad left, mom gave 0 fucks, taken by Grand Pa, good childhood since, seperated under false from GPs ex, abused, locked away, missed 4th and 5th grades, won back by GP, changed as a person, broke GP heart, still loved came back. Sheltered, scared of world, innocence lost. Fast forward 15 years. Nothings changed. 2/10. Maybe a movie of shit."
61,"I never have a drink before the sun goes down, but I never go to bed quite sober."
62,"Story time. I've always been a ""nerdy girl"". Glasses, science/math wiz, band geek. I was pretty much invisible until college, when I found people who shared my interests and weren't put off by my being smart, like it seemed most of the guys from high school were. 

Once I got to college, I focused more on having a friend circle instead of trying to find ""the one"". The man I married was part of my friend circle in college. We ended up together after developing a friendship then doing a stint of being FWB before we ""officially"" started dating."
63,We could be friends :D
64,Yes. Always. It’s common courtesy to disclose other partners if you’re sleeping with someone 
65,Hmm interesting
66,"Varied diet. Emphasis on vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Plenty of water. Minimal usage of refined sugars and other junk foods, but still splurge once in a while for psychological reasons."

69,"Hercules Poirot 

The genius detective from Agatha Christie's novels.

The sass is real."
70,"I'm doing very well. Happily married, living my best life. Thank you for your concern. "
71,Monospace fonts are the best.
72,"This is how it started out for me. I was around 15 and online when people started taking an interest in me. I didn’t think anything of it then but looking back it was really scary. This one person was asking for my address and wanted to “get away” together. Thankfully, one day I accidentally left my browser open and my older brother saw the messages and took care of it. "
73,"This is fantastic!  I can’t tell you the number of women I have come to my clinic for nausea and heartburn and get pissed when I quickly do an EKG and end up calling an ambulance. “It’s just heartburn, not a heart attack!”  No, ma’am.

76,Yes! I literally have tendinitis in my shoulder from wearing bras and having a large chest. 
77,"Board and card games. I've always enjoyed them, but nobody to play with. Hubby and I play a game every night during dinner. It's a nice, relaxing way for us both to chill after his work day and my school day."
78,"Touché my dude. You may be right about that second part, though tbh. I have way too much fun arguing with and annoying people on here. One day someone’s gonna take it way too seriously and come after me lol"
79,I love growing herbs! So satisfying when they finally break through the soil with their little green nubs. Plus they taste delicious in food!
80,Omg I'm male I've never thought of this is my life. I was like why would you need a shelf. Then it hit me
81,"I grew up in a house with animals all over- I loved each and everyone of them deeply, and when they passed it devestated me. But when I took in my Tuktuks- he is just a huge part of my heart. I love that creature more than I love most people. He got sick once- like VERY sick, and I was so worried about him I took him to the vet ER where they put him on a special diet and antibiotics- I cried so hard and worried he wasn't going to get better. I've never been so worried about a pet in my life, but i know that someday when he passes (and god i can't even think about it) i will be absolutely broken."
82,"i'm British, mostly Welsh. a lot of people think i love football(soccer) or rugby(american football) i hate both. i also hate harry potter."
83,A Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini :)
84,I bought a pair of leggings at Marshall’s or Ross a few weeks ago with side pockets I can fit my hand and almost half my forearm in!!!! They are AMAZING.
85,What kind of 'gamer' wants to sit down and play video games wearing a short stupid dress. Mate I wanna wear track pants. These thighs shouldn't be rubbin ya here?

88,"we were high school sweethearts for 5 years, we got engaged for 3 months and cheated on me with my best friend of 2 years. all at the same time my other ex boyfriend started dating my childhood best friend. i   was severely depressed for months and months because my ex best friend who was dating my ex fiance was bullying and harassing me by sending pictures of them. after 6 months they broke up cause he finally listened when i told him she's toxic af and his family wanted the better girlfriend back lol.   


i'm no longer in love with him and in love with my amazing boyfriend of a year who has been supporting me through this tough time. "
89,"The main reason cars are poorly adapted for short people is that a small person can fit into a space that's too big for them, but fitting a big person into a space that's too small while still being able to drive is nigh-on impossible (so yes, basically the reason is money). I'm 6'1"", which isn't that tall, but there are a fair number of cars where the driving position is too small for me. If car manufacturers designed cars for a driver who was, say 5'3"" (the average height of a British woman) then a huge number of people simply wouldn't be able to buy those cars, because they wouldn't fit in them however much they adjusted it (a lack of headroom would be the biggest issue, with slumping contributing to a lack of legroom between the pedals and the steering wheel). I agree it's silly that they don't produce two versions of a car, the market is surely large enough and the adaption is only in the driver's seat. Not doing crash testing with 'woman-sized' dummies is just criminal."
90,I would love to know this and learn as well. It's been a few years but it's as fresh as it happened yesterday. As one of the commenter mentioned building trust again is important but I don't know how to do that anymore.
91,I would love to know the answer to this too. I don’t know how to go about romantic relationships at all ever since my assault.
92,Playing my keyboard :)
93,"My parents got chickens a while back for their farm and I never realized how absolutely delightful they are! They go around the yard all day eating bugs, they lay delicious and healthy eggs to eat, and they are affectionate too! They follow me and my mom around and like to sit in our laps if we sit down.

Side note- my parents also got pigs, and everything people say about pigs is a LIE. They smell horrible, they may be smart but they are evil. And they are super destructive. The field that they were in is torn to pieces and they ate an entire tree. An entire mf'ing TREE. "
94,double yikes. i definitely haven't done that. maybe reddit just isn't for you. 
95,"We were together for 6 years, lives together 4.5 of them. It took my 2 years from realizing I had to leave to having the courage to do it. Due to his finances being a mess I knew he couldn’t afford our place alone and we lived near all of his family. So when he was out of town for the weekend I packed up the car with my essentials (including all your documents like passport, checkbooks etc) and when he came home I just calmly said “this is over, I’m done. I’m going out of town to stay with family for 2 weeks for you to get your things out of here” I made sure to leave before he could manipulate me into staying, as he had before. 
It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It has been the best thing. After 8 months I’m starting to date a bit again and doing much better. I knew if I stayed in that relationship just to be with someone I would have been so unfulfilled in my life. "
96,Not me. I don't understand people who think like this.
97,I don’t think it’s most women but there certainly are some out there.
98,"We try to make it out to our besties house at least once a week- our husbands are best friends so it doesn't really effect that. Lately my best lady friend has been WORKING AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF HOURS- but its cool ;) Usually Saturdays are for visiting friends who are further away than our primary friend group (who live like... 3 minutes away), but since my husband has been workin 6 day work weeks, i try to either stay home or see friends that are just mine- or my family. "
99,Gah! I’m sorry! I used the B word referring to myself again. Can’t help it. Better see a therapist about it lol. 
100,"Oh wow! That’s awesome! Honestly, I wish I had done something like that in college or at least explored the things not related to my current job. I feel like I am so involved with my current position that I need a break from it sometimes, but don’t know how to get back into something that gets me thinking more creatively or just letting loose and doing something from the heart. If you love it, you def shouldn’t give it up. I really think that’s amazing! "
101,"-Born youngest in a massive family in a apocalyptic cult

-Always surrounded by people (like 50) due to living on a commune, but they're all weird and there was a *lot* of singing.

-tons of dogs for some reason

-Obviously homeschooled. Mostly read and kept secluded. All my friend options were ""jesus freaks"". ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

-""officially"" kicked out at 16 for not doing the proper paperwork (turns out they expected you to convert people). Parents didn't find out.

-Went to community college because they offered me a pell grant and I ""couldn't just say no to free money"" even if it was a ""secular education"". 

-Did great, got incredibly social (because I met non-jesus nerds) but still struggled hardcore with socialization. Picked up a bf.

-Left for actual college, left first bf and got a second one, got a job in my field. Second bf left.

-Graduated with CS degree, got a significantly better job, got therapy, and got a cat.

-Got tons of plants, mostly avoid my family and never talk to anyone else from the cult, have new friends and am doing better in therapy."

106,"There's this tattoo shop in my friend's town that's supposed to be called ""badass tattoo"" but there logo looks like it says ""Bad Ass Tattoo""... Don't wanna be tattooed there.."
107,"For the first time in my LIFE I bought a cute too that had buttons down the front, but the seam was sewn shut. It’s brilliant. "
108,"I'm friends with a few performers and I adore this bravado and celebration of femininity. These girls put 3+ hours into perfecting their appearance and the result is truly a work of art. I always feel so frumpy in comparision, though..."
109,"Also the jackets-, for them to fit around hips means getting extra room around the stomach, as men in that size tend to have big bellies haha. Ended up getting smallet jacket and ripping the sides a bit from down up"
110,"I don't think it needs to be an expectation that celebs are 100% transparent about it. They don't need to tell the world everything they're getting up to get into shape, stay fit and eat well.

But I do have a problem if they are being hypocritical about it or outright lying and being misleading. Like if they were promoting natural beauty or telling everyone to love themselves for who they are, whilst at the same getting cosmetic surgery and altering their appearance in an extreme way. For example, I agree with Jameela Jamil calling out celebs who peddle snake oil products and claim or imply that these random supplements and laxatives are what makes them look the way they are (rather than the hours and hours with strict gym regiments and diet plans). I think it's an ethical issue and celebs who have influence over vulnerable demographics like young teenagers, should be very careful and conscious about the messages they're sending."
111,"Sometimes I absently finger-comb my hair, as well as twirling it.  It's gentler than using a brush to remove knots."
112,I'm 24 currently and my biological clock started going nuts when I was about 21 and hasn't stopped since. I barely handle it. It helps knowing that we will probably have a child within the next couple of years.
113,"I honestly don't care one way or the other. I'm not into pop culture generally, but also I feel like it's their business.a"
114,Same with me. Now that I’m with an amazing guy who understands what happened to me it doesn’t feel scary to me 
115,So I take it you're not such a fan of working out lol? Don't blame you =P

119,"Cool cool :) I'm the same way with girls lol, it's just not important to me personally. If they were really unhealthy/obese or something I may gently encourage and help them to try become more healthy for their own sake, but that's about it."
120,LOL. 
121,"Flirt, have fun, then ask if he wanted to bang 🤷🏼‍♀️"
122,"It takes time and it definitely effects everyone differently, but for me I only felt comfortable with it until I met someone who was very loving and understanding. I informed them of this situation before we met and I knew they would be patient and take their time if that is what I needed."
123,"Every other day, mainly lesbian "
124,"Bummed out for a bit, then shrug it off. I don't sit around and pine for someone for weeks. I express interest pretty quickly. It doesn't affect my confidence because I've turned down a lot of folks, so I get it"
125,"Yeah. It sucks. I don't know what the heck happened to him, why he started disliking me so much, I mean he used to talk about marriage, it's not that he never loved me. But I'm regaining my strength and my self worth, little by little. We deserve better. "
126,"Hair. 
I have thick, wavy, frizzy mess of hair. I struggled with it all my life. Finally at 43 I got it permanently straightened. Now I gladly pay $100-$200 a month to maintain it. "

138,"I've always been underweight. In high school, teachers would repeatedly call my mom and blame her for not taking care of my ""anorexia"" (I was eating easily two servings of anything I was given both at home and at school). For as long as I can remember, I've been desperate to gain some weight, to hide my ribs, knees and elbows, and wear loose clothes.

A couple of years back I finally found a diet that sort of works and an exercise routine that's helped me gain some weight through muscle (almost there with a decent BMI!). I'm still struggling with the fact that I won't be gaining fat anytime soon - a little fat would mean a better butt and larger breasts, but my body just won't store energy that way. Despite being in a wonderful relationship, I still feel extremely unattractive.

Working out and keeping up with my diet is a day to day effort, if I skip enough days my weight will slip back down, so it does still play a huge role in my life."

155,"So I used to be insecure and not be able to trust easily which caused a lot of jealousy when I was younger. As I grew older and went through an intense relationship with a very jealous person I learned that being jealous is exhausting and that people are going to do (or think) whatever they are going to do and there isn't much we can do about it. I came out of that relationship with a whole  new out look and THOUGHT I was over all jealousy.  

Fast forward to my next/ current relationship. My guy has a GORGEOUS bestie that is (what I thought) was the ideal woman. I used to be SO jealous of her. He and I would go round about her until he made what he wanted perfectly clear (me) and he made me realize something SO important  The person we are with is someone we CHOOSE to be with. If he wanted to be with her he wouldn't have been with me. He would have been persuing her. He chose/ chooses to be with me. That is what ultimately settled my jealousy. The knowledge that we choose each other every day and if someday he chooses to not be with me I trust that he will tell me. 

It's been 5 years since the jealousy issue got resolved and we will be celebrating 6 years together this June.    I have never felt more secure and more loved. I'm his choice and that makes me feel extremely special.

Hope this helps ❤️"

166,New pickpocket tactic?
167,Death Note. I'm basic like that.
168,My quail took considerable work to keep alive- more than any other birds. They would be curious about whatever predator was coming their way and stick their heads out of the coop :/
169,"This is indeed a really rough subject. I was assaulted at age 8 and didnt come clean until 18 and spent quite some time afraid of people in fear of what happened to me. 

It took awhile, and a lot of tears and breakdowns but through my supportive partner and therapy I've learned to love and enjoy intamacy again. 

It just takes time and a little bit of help. You'll get there. 💕"
170,Jealousy is usually caused by insecurity. I felt like my relationship was unstable at the time so I became jealous easily. I ended up being right and he cheated on me. 
171,"When I was single it was pretty rare that I'd reject someone for a qualifiable ""reason."" More often than not it was just that I didn't feel a ""click"" or interpersonal chemistry. The only instance in which you could reasonably gain someone's interest after being rejected is if there really *was* a qualifiable reason (and I mean *really* really, not ""really"" as in ""you pushed and pushed for a reason because 'I'm just not feeling a spark' wasn't good enough for you and she threw out something just to get you off her back"" sort of scenario). 

However, even if the qualifiable reason *is* legit, there's not usually an overnight change you can make--if someone is hesitant about dating you because you struggle with employment, for instance, you'd need to make a longterm change to your work ethic and commitment to employment stability, and you'd need to have your own interest in mind in order to make sure that change is sustainable. "
172,Gal Gadot or Natalie Portman. 
173,"It allows skin to skin contact, is reversible, has no side effects, hormone free, cheaper than condoms, less invasive and less expensive than an IUD, and it can be inserted several hours before sex so there’s no need to stop the action and put a condom on. "
174,Treat your anxiety issues. 
175,"Every single time. Its never been mutual as far as I know. It hasn't really affected my confidence because many of the people I've liked have been straight and good friends so it is nothing about me personally and the others have been women I've met on dating apps and I have rejected just as many women as have rejected me. 

What it affects more is making me fear for my future and that I am not going to ever be able to find someone with that mutual interest, or even if I find them they won't want to date someone my age with little to no relationship experience. But I wouldn't say that is a lack of confidence, I like who I am. "
176,"Sadly, there is. Mostly because they don’t realize they’re doing it. People bring so many assumptions and judgements to most interactions with other people, it’s human nature. We like to put things in boxes and categorize, it helps us process. So really, it says something about that person’s inability to empathize with someone who experienced something they can’t understand. So they try and explain it to themselves and that person in a way it makes sense to them. A lot of time that ends up placing blame on the victim because they want to try and come up with reasons it happened to that person and absolutely will not happen to them personally. That rationalization over empathy leads to revictimization. They aren’t doing it on purpose but to try and understand. However, it does more harm than good. 

Then there are people who prey on those who have been weakened and beat down by the world because they’re easier to control. Again, it’s a lack of empathy, but comes from a much more selfish, manipulative, and malicious place. 

It actually takes a lot of empathy to talk with a survivor of any kind of assault or abuse and not make them blame themselves more than they already do. You have to fully remove yourself from the situation and be there solely as an emotional support system. Most people can’t do that, they don’t have the emotional intelligence. 

For example: My sister has a hard time discussing our shared childhood abuse because she feels in a sense she didn’t protect me enough and that hurts her. So I tell her lightly if I’m not doing well but give her a lot of detail about the progress I make. I do my best to not revictimize her. It took me a long time to realize that was why she got upset and it took me removing my own opinions on what happened, because I blame her in absolutely no way. Once I realized this, we were able to start talking more. I have about 5 people I can be fully honest with out of my many personal relationships with what I went through and the daily struggles I face (not including the medical professionals I pay to help me as they are experts). A lot of my friends thought they were supportive but I had to stop talking to them because I ended up feeling more shame than had I kept it to myself or shared with a different person. They’re still my friends, but I don’t tell them everything. That’s reserved for a very select group of people who have proven to be highly empathetic, and funnily enough, they’ve faced hardships themselves. 

Sorry for the long explanation but this is something I’m very passionate about. I love to understand humans and it’s helped a lot with my own healing journey. "

198,"It was a 4 year relationship and I realized we had fundamental disagreements on our future. We both realized that there was no way to move forward to to compromise so we ended it as amicably as we could. He was nothing but great for me, and I hope he says the same for me. Not gonna lie, after the break up was really rough. I wrongly assumed all men were as gracious as he was, and I went through a few really crappy relationships. Were on good terms and he is now a quasi famous musician, which makes me so happy. Long story short, he eventually wanted to get married, have kids, settle down in the country. I never wanted to get married, have kids, and I wanted to explore dating women. He still doesnt have kids or isnt married, and is also dating a bisexual grad student. Funny how things turn out."
199,Me too! Totally worth the money. 
200,"My last relationship was the first time I ended a relationship and not the other way around. It was hard because I loved him very much, but it was very empowering standing up for myself and putting my well being first. I constantly needed to remind myself to think with my head and not my heart, as cliche as that sounds. "
201,"I love the way my wife smells, except when it's after really heavy exercising. Heavy exercise sweat creates a different smell than just normal daily life."
202,"I really hate the smell of baby powder, especially baby powder scented lotions, deodorant and sprays. It just had a sharp, unpleasant smell that makes me want to sneeze. Everyone talks about how wonderful that ""new baby"" smell is, then they merrily slather their kid in powder stink.

Now for the irony: I really love patchouli, which is a scent that stinks to a lot of people. To me it smells warm, earthy and spicy. To others it just smells like dirty hippie."
203,I'm sorry to say this but personally I can't.... sometimes I get flashbacks and is just a mood killer... :( 
204,"I finally have a partner that I am 100% physically comfortable with after a couple of failed long term relationships. It’s also something that never really goes away, but I personally have better management of my past traumas at my current age (48yrs) than I did in the past. It’s not an easy process especially if you’ve never really had a strong support system (I didn’t). I look at my past traumas almost like a chronic illness that has to be controlled so that I can live the kind of life I want to live. Support through family/friends, psychotherapy, and a willingness to want to be happy/comfortable in your own skin can really quicken the pace of managing the ptsd that’s associated with sexual assault.

Scooby Doo Ending: PTA Moms who juggle three kids, school volunteering, girl scouts, after-school activities, and still have a social life completely befuddle me."
210,"I was assaulted as a child, so my experience may not exactly relate to anyone else’s. 

My assault was my very first sexual encounter and it made me terrified of relationships and physical contact in general. My first relationship (that involved sex) was not enjoyable. I didn’t want to be touched by him, but I endured it because it was what I was “supposed” to do. (I realize now that this isn’t healthy thinking, but I’ve grown since then.) My partner was emotionally supportive, but sex was a priority for him and not for me. I eventually got on anti-depressants and tried therapy. Since then, sex has finally become enjoyable for me and something that I crave, where my libido was basically nonexistent before. It’s taken many years, but I finally have a healthy relationship with sex and enjoy it as much as everyone else seems to. "
211,"Im in this right now. It’s weird. Everyone keeps asking me how I feel and all I can say is “I don’t know.” I can’t tell if breaking up was the right thing to do, or if I misjudged things and let my mom guilt me into it. The distance didn’t help. 

I don’t know how I’m handling it. We agreed we would talk everything out again in 2 weeks of taking a break. I just don’t know. "

215,"Jeez. This is something they don't even cover in sex education. 

Sanitation education? "
216,"Yes but it took time. I also found out about demisexual and how I need an emotional connection to enjoy it. Rape doesn’t ruin sex but it did take away certain freedoms of it. Like I think had you never been assaulted you’d still have this sense of power, innocence and curiosity. If you have you understand that sometimes choice is taken and you approach things with more caution, if that makes sense."
217,"Well of course I know him, he's me."
218,"That's a really, really good simile. Did you do sex therapy or just standard therapy?"
219,"I do not have the motivation to go out and find two people to have sex with, so no. I don't mind hearing about the other person's hookups though. "

 Girls talk **so much, crap** and I've never really been gossipy unless with my SO (obviously). ""why"". if we talked about anything nice i'm sure it would be a positive step, no?? Do i *really* need to know that Barb is gross with her tampons and cheats on her spouse? no? oh ok. "
223,"In my case, I’m very attracted to him but we are very incompatible as a couple, also I’m not looking for a relationship right now so this works for me. 

I was just wondering if it’s a normal thing for people to openly discuss other hookups with their fwb. We all know this isn’t an exclusive thing, but that doesn’t mean it’s something explicitly discussed. "
224,"It was 4 months after my sexual assault that I had sex with someone.

This someone was a close friend, kind, patient, and considerate. He asked my consent, made sure everything was okay before proceeding. He never pressured me. The two experiences were very different. I trust him a great deal more than I ever trusted my assaulter. He was patient with me while we navigated my vaginismus (which I had before the assault, and possibly the only thing that saved me during the assault).

Everyone is different, and every so often, I think about the assault (it happened last July). But everyone copes differently."

227,"I basically came in when I could afford gas. When I couldn't, my mom was nice enough to give me some money, but it was still very much a bullshit situation that was only rectified after one of my professors called the funeral home CEO out on it. He told him it was bullshit that he was working me and my best friend on an unpaid internship. ""That's slavery."" That was the ONLY thing that got us paid, and even then, it was only like $8/hr for a funeral home that was making multi-millions.

I'm in the southern US, and that funeral home is now known for being cheapskates when it comes to their employees. 

Currently I'm making less than 30K with 7 years experience. So it's definitely a pay cut. But I am happier here than I was at the last place, and I was offered more money from this tiny family-owned funeral home that makes less than 300K/year than I was the multi-million dollar funeral home. I don't have benefits, but I'm able to afford private insurance. "
228,"I guess I'm wondering more of the ""right moment"""
229,"My father.

Growing up, I always saw my dad drinking. It was kind of his signature thing to always have a beer in his hand. As a kid, I thought that that was just a dad thing to do. It's only been since I've started drinking myself that I realized how bad it actually is. I've tried to keep pace with him, but I've always ended up super drunk while he remains mostly sober/slightly tipsy. When he was diagnosed with diabetes his doctor told him to cut back on the drinking, but he never has. It's become very apparent to me in the past 2 or so years of how much of a functioning alcoholic he is and how much he relies on alcohol to get him through the days, but since he goes to work every day and does his job well enough to hold it down, he doesn't see a problem with his drinking. At this point I don't see him ever changing or wanting to. It's sad, scary, and frustrating."

240,trust me i was in the exact same position as you a year ago. but now i'm so happy with someone i love and i hope you find that. 
241,"It didn’t work out. It had reached the point where it was either we break up, or get married. Not that marriage needs to be rushed, but it gets to the point where if you know you’re not going to get married, then staying together past college when you’re both going to be in separate towns doesn’t make sense. Or whatever your situation may be. I wasn’t planning to break up with him when I did, but we got in an argument and I was just done dealing with his shit when I didn’t even see a future for us. It took a few days of mourning before I could truly break it off, but at the same time, I just knew we were done. "
242,"You just have to remember that whatever happened, happened to your body. There is a place inside us that only we can reach, nobody else can get there. Regardless of all the torture and pain, you know that you are yourself. Forgive yourself, love yourself, and the healing process begins.

Therapy is imperative. haha. But did you know that every 7 years all of the cells in our body have been replaced at least once?? Basically whatever that assaulter touched will be replaced new cells :) "
243,"I was married for 19 years. We met when I was 17, I was pregnant 1 month after we met and married 4 months later. Its amazing we stayed married as long as we did honestly. There is so much about this man I loved and will always love and we were great parents together. Raised 3 beautiful children who are smart and giving individuals. Around 16 years of marriage I started to feel this distance between us. He didn't seem to care about us spending time together. I felt like an emotional burden on him. I asked for couples therapy, I read relationship books and even wanted to have our personality test match together. He just didn't seem to care. I felt abandon emotionally. It made me so sad for a long time then angry. I needed a partner who wanted me emotionally not just physically. We have been divorced now for 2 years. We tried to make it work again after the divorce. I felt after months of only having a physical relationship with him that it would never be anything more that so I had to force myself to move on. I didn't want to move on. I wanted to go to therapy together. Because I knew it forcing myself to stop loving him, would be the hardest thing to do. I would question it and I have many times but at the end of the day you cant be the only one fighting for the relationship. So I cut ties, blocked him on social media and only discuss the kids. I do not reach out to him even when it hurts so much and I think he is the only one who can help. I don't call, text, email etc. You have to let go and move on. It hurts to know that the person you thought was going to be your partner forever is gone but change is part of life. You move on and you meet people. You lean on friends/family for loving support. You remind yourself that your needs should come first. That you are worth more than what you were being giving. Then when you meet a special someone you let them know that your needs are important and if that person truly wants you in their lives they will feel the same. If that person is right for you, you both will find peace together.  "
244,Winter is the absolute worst! My mom always said spring babies are the best and had both me and my sister in spring. I also want to avoid being 9 months pregnant in the hottest summer months. I'm hoping nature will let my plans pan out! 
245,"Jelly, I have a recurve and I never get to practice! I agree it's great for meditation. "
246,"*Gia* is now on my list.

*The Notebook*..of course!

And *Law Abiding Citizen* is a fantastic movie!! I like watching it every couple of years, so I'm just as mind blown as I was the first time. I last watched it about 3 years ago, so I'm thinking it's time. I've watched it at least 4 times and I seriously can't remember it at all. So exciting ! lol"
247,Yep. I seemed to have missed that one too. No regrets. 
248,[removed]
249,"Am I the only one who just sang along as I read, instead of glancing at it like a normal person? "
250,"You are an absolute golden nugget, Sir. "
251,"Yoga! I’ve been doing it for 1.5 years now and I love it and can’t imagine not doing it at least once a week. 

I started because I was at a point in my life where I decided I needed to change my life so I went to try something new — yoga! Prior to that I was active — I ran long distances and played various team sports so I never thought yoga would be for me but I was pleasantly surprised. 

It helped me calm my mind (during practice, I try my best to focus only on what is happening on the mat), listen more to my body and tone my body (bonus!). 

I’ve had highs and lows (not being able to focus 100% on the mat sometimes, inability to get into certain poses) in my practice like with everything in life but one thing is for sure — it is something I truly enjoy despite it all! 

Now, I practice at least once a week if I’m very busy but I usually go for 2 lessons per week. My favourites are hatha and vinyasa — especially hot classes! In terms of poses, I still have a Long way to go but I can see the progress and it’s heartening! 

Really highly recommend trying yoga — it’s really good for the mind and body and it’s not as lame as people make it out to be! "
252,"Oh damn, that's nasty even on a functioning alcoholics level. Never drive while over the limit, he could be putting so many people at risk."
253,"We were together for two years of college and most of our relationship was long distance. I thought I really loved him but when I moved to a new city (only around 30 minutes from where he lived) and started a new job I realized that he wasn't what I needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered going out with my friends, meeting new people, and realizing that I was settling in a relationship that made me feel comfortable but didn't make me feel confident or happy. I remember trying so hard to give him signals that things weren't working. I didn't want to be intimate with him, I didn't want to spend time with him, and I didn't love him. These feelings lasted for over a month and I was too afraid to say anything to him. In hindsight I was stringing him along because it was comfortable for me and I was being truly selfish. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I finally ended things with him I felt sad because a big part of my life was now gone. He said that there was no way we could be friends because it would hurt him too much. I also felt relieved. 

&amp;#x200B;

After spending time apart I recognized my confidence rising and I felt so much more content with myself. With more perspective I don't think I really loved him. He scrutinized me constantly, made me feel bad about myself whenever I reached out to him, and made me feel like I was ""lucky"" to have anyone as good as him. He showed me a lot about what I don't want in a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although it was challenging to end things I felt immediate gratification knowing that I can bring myself so much more happiness than he ever could. "
254,"Personally, as a male trying to tread the waters of polyamory(I am a jealous person, I hate it, and Am going to therapy weekly for it) I personally would like to know that the relationship was open, but other than speaking to how prior shaped your current sexual reality, I don’t want to know any specifics. Or at least not until there are a few hangout sessions under the belt. 

I recently went on a date with a married woman and as I was discussing my ex, she told me that her and her husband had a threesome with her. Which, after having been intimate with her, would have had a lot less of a bombshell impact than 5 min on the first date. 

But take my opinion with a grain of salt, like I said I’m trying my hardest not to be jealous but there’s a male perspective. Thanks and have a great day. Also very open to criticism/advice!"
255,Time. 
256,[removed]
257,"I have a name that could be either male or female traditionally, and also have a last name that could double as a first name as well, so I get this shit all the time. 

Honestly I usually don’t think too much of it, and occasionally I’ll give people a call to talk to them directly and let them hear my voice. "
258,"&gt; I'm basically the intelligent female version of; Ricky Bobby lol

I think I know a lot of women like this... possibly including myself!

&gt; What kind of car do you drive?

Anything anyone dares to hand me the keys to! I've done a hot lap in a food truck, which was exciting. The chassis was surprisingly stable and good, but I worried the box on the back would collapse. I could feel it twist.

I mostly run MX-5s and 911s, with my garage having a third gen MX-5 and a GT3 RS (2007 / 997.1, if you know them by type numbers). I'm really fortunate to be in a position to access a lot of great and special vehicles.

What do you work on? What's your favorite parts of the car to modify?"
259,"I'd probably be most upset about being heavily-ish pregnant for my September wedding and that it might be a Christmas baby, which sounds horrible.

  


  


I'd probably lean heavily towards an abortion- not because of those things, but because we're still trying to get both of us financially in a good position to swing having a child in the United States."
260,"He was my first boyfriend and we were 17/18. At the time, I really thought I loved him and that we could make anything work between us. For that reason, I let him gaslight me and manipulate me a lot, especially nearer to the end of our relationship. I wanted to go away for school and he was very against that. That is what first poisoned the well - I realized I wanted a partner who supported my dreams. He still had another year of high school (he had not passed some classes...), so it's not like he could have gone with me to university that first year. We talked briefly of him applying to college programs in my university town, but the thought of going long distance made me too anxious because he was already clingy being in the same city.

I broke up with him in the summer before I left for university and it was very, truly, ridiculously hard for 17 year old me. He was talking about engagements and marriage and babies and I was moving on to bigger and brighter things without him. I cried for a week straight because I felt awful for hurting the person I loved. Now, almost 10 years later, I definitely do not regard him as anything more than my first boyfriend/learning experience. When I consider my feelings for my partner now, I definitely do not miss my high school boyfriend or think of him at all anymore. 

My highschool exboyfriend actually reached out a year ago for the first time in years. He asked me on a date the next time I was in my hometown and when I replied that my boyfriend would probably end up joining since he was not from my hometown and would have nothing else to do, suddenly my high school ex mentioned his girlfriend of 3 years and how she wanted to move in with him. Funny how things go....."
261,9 if you avoided getting the cat.
262,"I think this happened to me and I just said ""no""and walked away as I assumed they were pranking me. "
263,"Oh boy. We dated from 10th grade till halfway into our first year of college. The relationship was very toxic in the first year and it affected the rest of our time together. 

I'd had enough of him zigzagging between ""I want you and I love you!"" and ""I don't know if I want to be together."" He never wanted to see me or hang out and told me, a month before we broke out, that he saw me out of pity and resented me. He had a terrible meanstreak.

He wanted less than I gave and I wanted more than he gave. I realized we just couldn't be what the other wanted, and ended it. I wasn't all bad, I have lots of good memories with him. It's just that the bad was *so bad*. 

That was a year and a half ago and I'm still very much love him. But I just accept that love and keep going about my day. I suspect that he will always have a place in heart and I will always have love for him. But we may never be the right people for one another and that's okay. 

You can love someone and not be with them. That sentence is how I got through the break up."

271,I'm so sorry you have been going through this. EMDR therapy is extremely helpful for this exact situation. 
272,"It sucks. Men get to wear nice looking loafers and super shiny dress shoes and be mostly comfortable. I think I'm just going to get a single pair and keep them under my desk.

279,"Hmmmm honestly, I’m not sure? I’ve been dating someone a few months and we don’t wear matching clothes or partake in a lot of PDA other than handholding and the occasional peck. Sometimes we’ll do the...not really “baby talk” thing but it’ll be kind of “cutesy talk” or something. 

Once in a while if we’re out he’ll kiss me on the forehead. Instead of any butterflies, it’s more a feeling of comfort and it makes me want to snuggle him."

284,"Kind of a combo of meal prep, gardening, and self sufficiency. I grow vegetables and I love cooking. I've been saving vegetable scraps in the freezer in a gallon bag. When its full, I throw them in the instant pot with water and make broth. Then the broth becomes a big batch of soup which I freeze part of for future lunches. I keep trying to get as much use out of everything as possible. I'm growing some onions right now, and while they grow, the green tops need to be kept trimmed. Those go into my bag in the freezer. Everythings a beautiful cycle. "
285,"My name is ambiguous yes. 

But, if it is ambiguous to you, why go straight to 'sir', rather than calling me by my first name or Dr Blabla? There is no need to use sir at all. And if you are not sure, you should definitely not be using sir. 

For me it is a small symptom, and no I would not die on that hill either. But it is nonetheless part of a manifold. So I am going to correct it from now on as there ought to be no harm in doing so. ""By the way I'm female"" is a good way to do it."
286,"Wow. You are really worked up about some random people's choice of a font. I've never even noticed that font and really, really, really don't care at all. This is not a ""women"" thing. This is a ""you"" thing.

I would guess it is popular because it is easily legible for the most part and has a good bit of visual interest without looking overly fancy which gives it a wider variety of use options."

That was especially true in my previous role as Chief of Staff, where people who knew I was a woman often assumed I was an Executive Assistant (a very important role, but one occupied by someone else at my company). Those who thought I was a man generally treated me like a right hand and strategic partner to my boss, which was closer to my actual role.

That said, when people explicitly assume I'm a man, I generally add this to the end of my next email: ""Also wanted to flag that I'm actually a woman, though I get Mr. X a lot because of my first name."""

I find it helps to remind myself that if they're gonna cheat, they're gonna cheat. Nothing I can do will prevent that, and it's not a reflection on me as a person. You can be the best partner in the world and get cheated on. Sad but true. It's 100% a reflection on the cheater's poor choices.

I love fresh cut grass smell in the springtime,  humid summer evening pre-thunderstorm, fall fireplace/bonfire, the woods, pearberry dishwashing liquid(gain), rosewater shampoo by pure&amp;clean I think is the brand, smells like fresh salon shampoo(no sulfates), subtle men's cologne (no spicy notes) not overbearing but barely there ;) &amp; the line of hempz bodycare.. especially the honey melon body oil, so light and natural.

I like the smell of lemon cookies, coffee, silky wind on a cold night, rain, fresh laundtry, cozy food cooking..

Others are very extreme, but 95% of things are tagged appropriately so you won't be stumbling across things that may upset you.

It allowed me to have a sexual outlet that I could control what I heard &amp; experienced without the fear of having another person involved (which I was *not* ready for, at the time).

Just as a blanket statement-I think that cheating is more complex than a black and white “dump the cheater, they’re a horrible person and didn’t love their partner”. To me it depends on how they cheated (full sex or just a kiss, emotionally etc), how the partner find out (did they tell them or get found out) and if the root cause was discovered and corrected. 


Depending on the cheating, it absolutely could be an all-time low/biggest regret for a relationship. "

323,Does she just not read the signs everywhere that say not to flush feminine hygiene products or not to flush anything on this list/only flush items on this list? That's pretty ignorant.
324,"For me, I never had a sexual experience before my assault. I didn't get to see what I would've enjoyed prior, and I was younger.

At first, I was very into the act of just having sex, (when I began dating someone after it happened). I was intense, and found myself pushing for more than what my bf's were offering. I can't remember a time where I felt love, it was just sex to me.

When I got into college, I would enter FWB relationships and then end it when they wanted more than just sex. This lasted until I finally trusted my current BF enough to enter a relationship, and it's been almost 2 years since. 

I finally feel love when being intimate with him. I do enjoy really rough sex, like a lot of the other comments mention, and I think it ties back to what started it all. But my current BF respects my boundaries, when and where I want to be intimate, and what we can experiment with. 

I think back to the day of my assault sometimes and get a little sad, but it's been 8 years, and has gotten easier since dating my boyfriend and seeing a therapist. It takes time, trust, and help. It's not easy, and never will be. But in time, it does become easier. 

I wish you the best OP.

325,"No, it's an anxiety thing! "
326,"Honestly? Lots and lots of therapy. Which I know doesn't work for some people but for me, it was essential. Having somebody neutral to talk all that shit out with has been invaluable.

Outside of that, I do a lot of talking myself off the ledge so to speak. This morning, I woke up and found my husband in the garden, talking to somebody on the phone. Immediately my brain was like ""OMG WHYYY"". But I just took a deep breath and told myself that everything was fine. He could be talking to his dad for all I know and didn't want to wake me. No need to get upset. And I just kept repeating that stuff to myself until he got off the phone. Just talking back to that ugly monster in your head helps a lot. Never did find out who he was on the phone with and you know what, I don't even care. "
327,"No, mostly because I don't have an absolutist view on cheating, and I was very stupid in relationships with empathy gaps when I was younger.

I feel like being manipulative is net-net worse than cheating."

Negative: Neurotic"
329,"Really cliche but true. I love taking a hot bubble bath with my rosemary and eucalyptus bath soak. I light my rose scented candle and turn out the lights. I put on some Welcome to Night Vale in the background and I sip a mixture of rum and apple juice (try it!). It is the best.

Runner up would be soaking in my foot bath with a book and some Billie Holiday on Spotify. My husband makes fun of me for having a foot bath and say that makes me an old woman :P"
330,"You’re overthinking this. 
  "
331,Figure skating or hockey? What influenced you to pick it up as an adult?
332,Which language are you learning? 
333,"Yes. I will admit I took time before I was with someone after my incident. Years. But when I finally found someone I wanted to be with, I prepared myself to feel uncomfortable, to have to set boundaries, flashbacks, etc.   
They honestly never came during intimacy, but I will also say that I had months to get to know this person before intimacy was even possible. Being comfortable with him is everything, but being worried about associating my sexual attack with other sexual experiences has not been an issue.  


Women, be comfortable with your first. I was a mess of anxiety, I am not anymore. I spoke to a therapist for a few sessions, decided on some answers to a lot of questions about that day, and am better for taking the time with myself.   


Love and strength to all of you."

335,I was hear to say this!!!
336,"Depends on how that date went, how I felt, and if I was comfortable with the idea of it."
337,Assuming they're not someone I already know as a friend ... that's too soon for my comfort.
338,"Eating a balanced diet - limiting processed foods, artificial sugars, and alcohol. I've always eaten fairly heathy. I love cooking and don't eat out a lot so that helps. It's just kind of been the norm for me. "
339,"On a luxury cruise with friends, I got drunk (this literally never happens) and I attempted to take the fire alarms out (not sure why) and called the butler to help me take my hair extensions out. 

First and last time I've ever been drunk. I cringe every time they start retelling it. "
340,"its been many years since i ""cheated"" since i dont participate in monogamy anymore but its definitely not worse thing ive done. The worst is pretending to still like him when i dont"
341,"Right? They look great, I appreciate their effort, but man... I don’t want to get up that early."
342,"I appreciate it almost all the time, unless I’m alone at night or in an otherwise sketchy situation. Oh, or at work. I already have to work hard to be taken seriously at work sometimes."
343,Keep track of calories and don't buy crappy food.
344,Very cool. Do you live in an emotionally pent up environment?

346,"Same haha, I always think I come across as boring at first and make a bad impression, but I warm up after a while...just no one ever sticks around for that lol"
347,I've never had one and I don't intend to ever experience one.
348,I used to wax but the period in between when you're waiting for the hair to grow back is super annoying. My hair grows fast AF so I felt it looked good for literally like one day
349,Told me how bad it was sooner so I could have helped him get help and medication sooner. Or been a better partner to him. 
350,I had ptsd so it took my a long time to even been in a closed room with a man. I became very guarded (and still am) about intimacy in my life but I can still enjoy it. It just takes more to trust someone I want to be intimate with. 
351,It’s not easy. 
352,"Yes, cry✊"
353,How to dress/ or create an outfit. wtf. 
354,"One of my best friends has been in an unhealthy relationship for a few years. He has hit her, called her a bitch, threatened to spread rumours about her, always makes rude comments. One of our friends once described seeing something that sounded like he was violent toward her while she was naked and passed out after being drunk. We all hate him and have always told her she deserves better. But I know abusive relationships can be addictive.

I remind her that it is abuse -- I sent a list of signs and she said he does all of those things. I encourage her to break up with him. I started helping with her resume so she can look for another job. At this point I've considered giving her money so she's able to leave but I think that could just make her feel worse. "
355,Actually it feels bad. It's an obsession and then an addiction. It feels like life is not good anymore without that person in it. This is exactly the same thing that happens when you start taking a hard drug. I feel much better and more relaxed when I'm not in love. So I try to stay clear of it. I'm 40 plus.
356,"I love nothing more than a really long, hot shower. It relaxes me so much and I always feel a lot better when I come out.

Unfortunately, it hardly ever happens just because of life and kids."
357,that’s so interesting since they are pretty opposite! You must’ve changed a lot since you were younger!
358,"I’ve gotten Jhene Aiko, Rosario Dawson and Zoe Saldana which is funny because none of them look anything alike. "
359,"Yeah, sometimes women talking about vaginal birth accidentally say things that make me feel bad about my emergency c-section. It bothered me a lot at first but now I speak up and people have responded really positively."
360,"Braces to straighten my teeth and a permanent retainer to hold them in place since then. Per my orthodontist at the time, I need to keep the permanent retainers installed ""until I catch a husband and no longer care if my teeth are straight."" "
361,"I was really jealous early on in my relationship. Now I'm mostly jealous of things that take his attention away from me. It took me a while but I realized that the jealousy stemmed from me not thinking I was good enough and generally feeling insecure. Once I started working on myself and building up my self confidence, things stopped bothering me as much. 

Honestly, if he's spending a lot of time with someone else or doing something and not paying attention to me, I just take a deep breath and go find something to do that's fun. Or I make plans with a friend or call my mom. "
362,"I hate it. I tense up like a cat that gets wet. I do not like the feeling on my body of being sopping wet unless I am willingly submerged in water. I do not like when I am forced to be soaked without consenting to it. Also, rain usually means that it looks cloudy and gloomy outside. And then, for a few years, I've not had a car and have had to walk over 2 miles in the rain to get to work, and let me tell you, that's not pleasant"
363,Look I just want the bathroom to not be gross and covered in hair (please let it be head hair) so I can feel like it's a normal sanitary place for me to change a pad
364,yes
365,"Holllly shit, I'm so sorry, I hope you were okay and there wasn't any permanent damage? Jeez, he sounds like a fucking psycho, excuse my French. Hopefully he can't touch you now"
366,"I have no idea. I’m sure many of people have dated non-exclusively before getting into a relationship, and in America it’s common to non-exclusively date multiple people for a while before choosing one to date “seriously.” "
367,"Syrup, syrup and more syrup."
368,About 14lb. I want to be a stone lighter.
369,"sometimes 0 and sometimes 10 (from my current weight specifically). Idk, it'd be nice to have a flat stomach again, but like, I like how my boobs look rn"
370,Head? Where do you think you are? 
371,"Two ear lobe piercings, double helix on left ear, and daith on right ear. I love my piercings and I want maybe 1 or 2 more on the right ear.

About the daith, I know many people get them because they supposedly help ease the suffering of migraines. That’s not why I got the piercing, but I am a person who occasionally gets migraines. It has not impacted the terrible-ness of any migraines I’ve had at all. Migraines still feel the same. Thankfully i haven’t had a migraine in a really long time though. This is just my personal experience and I thought I’d share for anyone who might’ve been wondering about the daith piercing and migraine relief."
372,"Took time to separate that they are not the same thing. Worked on triggers in therapy and made sure my partner knew about them. 

Took some patience. The person I'm with is not forcing anything, this is me giving, trusting and consenting. In a way once I decided to be intimate it was the last step of closure, of owning my body again and putting the past behind me.  "
373,"It’s definitely happened to me way more often than not, but I just picked myself back up and maintained the friendship. Sometimes I got a little down, but I bounced back and tried hard not to let it show to the guy. There’s gonna be someone out there, and the person is doing you both a favor by turning you down! After all, you want to be with someone who is just as into you. "
374,"Very much so! He’s doing better on medication and he actually likes his therapist, therapy has really helped him with boundaries. He’s even opened up about his disorder publicly to try and dispel some stigma of it, and all our friends and family (minus my horrible mother) have been very supportive. 


It’s still an ongoing battle but he’s trying so hard and I’m very proud of him. 


He’s type 2, I didn’t even realize there were more than 1 until his diagnosis. "
375,Mine. I was a single mom. So they’re a Falsetts
376,Death Note or Naruto
377,"One foot in front of the other, almost like walking a tightrope or even slightly stepping over the line. Watch closely how Elle Woods walks on Legally Blonde (seriously) or watch drag queens hit the runway on drag race. "
378,This is my answer too! Cross stitching is practically the only thing that I completely focus on and am able to turn my hamster-wheel-brain off for!
379,"No, I just am just an aggressive and physical person who has found her outlet."
380,"I hope it's okay that I respond as a man who was sexually assaulted.   


TBH, it was really really hard to be physically intimate with people I loved because I viewed sex as a sort of dangerous theft taking place. As a result I would never touch even the people I loved, or if I tried to because I felt like I had too, it always felt incredibly awkward.   


 It took me dating someone who was so incredibly safe and non pressuring and unconditionally loving that I knew 100% without question that my emotional and spiritual wellbeing was more important to her than any kind of getting her rocks off. She let me know we didn't have to, she hugged me, she listened to me, and what do you know, when I felt that safe, I wanted to be intimate with her.   


My guess is that if you aren't enjoying it, somewhere inside you still don't feel safe. It took me many years. I had to cry about it. Like loud long 15 minute wailing kind of cries, but on the other end, it honestly feels as pure as if I had never been assaulted at all. Honestly, if I didn't have such an incredibly pure-hearted partner, I'm not sure i'd feel as safe, but she is that way, and I do feel safe. "
381,this exactly
382,"This.

My ex husband is bipolar, but refused help. He claimed he was fine and didn’t need meds. He thought his behavior was normal. I’m actually a psych nurse, so I’m familiar with the disorder and have no prejudice against it in and of itself. But, left untreated, bipolar disorder wreaks havoc on a relationship. "
383,"Just got out of the pool, vacationing in Mexico. "
384,My bedroom. 
385,It is a strange city
386,"Never tried with kiwi, I love it so much it is very refreshing and tasty"
387,"Respectful, friendly, never gonna be non-platonic or even hinting at it attention from men is what I appreciate. Sexual attention from men I don't know, or that I've flirted with first, just triggers my anxiety so I don't want that type of attention ever."
388,"Load up my car with a full tank of gas, withdraw a couple hundred from the bank, then drive to the nearest abortion provider."
389,Consent. So hot right now.
390,"That is a nightmare and I'm glad you got out. I hope your family knows the extent of the harm he's done and if they refuse to believe it and continue to prioritize him, you're probably going to have to burn some difficult bridges.... have you tried speaking to a family therapist?"
391,"""Don't chase after men"". It's more because they never had to (i.e. they're good looking and knew from a young age). I had to learn the hard way."
392,Omg 😮 Same thing has happened to me. I lost 50 lbs and got trashed cuz I didn’t know how much my body could handle anymore and was throwing up in the limo everywhere. It was beyond mortifying. 
393,your arms probably aren't hairy if you don't feel the need to. I know girls who do \[they have pcos aka too much testosterone\] and their arms are as hairy as a man's. not joking. 
394,"Nana!  I like how the characters are full grown adults with adult issues (albeit through a lens of growing celebrity and such).  I like josei the best so Nana was a delight for me to discover.
"
395,"All of my friends wear only thongs, and I'm just like, okay guys, I get it, lol."
396,"Sitting in a log cabin in snowy NH, there's a fire going in the wood stove, and we're watching The Snowman. "
397,Love
398,"""Tough guys"" = the wreck less kid at daycare... Just an Insecure Ego."
