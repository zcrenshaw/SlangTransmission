0,"Yea I'm fine, I can just get paranoid about these things. Thank you for answering my question though! 

My boyfriend also tells me all of his gross stuff too, we've been together for over 6 years, maybe we've let go too much lol. "
1,Talking about some of my issues from my childhood. Some were extremely difficult to deal with (still are).
2,"If you can both talk about gross stuff, I think that's a sign of a good match. :)

I'm not willing to date anyone I'd have to hold in my farts around (see username)."
3,"Okay, at first I laughed, but then I remembered that at a Halloween party full of people I didn‚Äôt really know I found a tube of fake blood in the host‚Äôs bathroom (it was on the counter, I wasn‚Äôt snooping) so I faked a really realistic nosebleed and went into the living room putting on a shocked act and expecting a few laughs. Instead I got some confused looks and ‚Äúoh my god...is she okay?‚Äù Then when I went in to the bathroom to wash it off there was of course no soap, towel, or toilet paper to clean it off with (because college) so my face was stained for the rest of the night. Lol, one of those ‚Äúthat went better in my head‚Äù moments. Sometimes personal humor doesn‚Äôt translate "
4,"No worries, I tend to be wordy myself! This is all really helpful so thank you. I also use Deciem but haven't used their vitamin C yet - I think you're one of 2-3 people here who have recommended it! I also like to apply my heavier serums or toners at night since it takes some time to absorb. Hopefully we'll both be looking good and young years from now!"
5,I was pretty crazy about a friend of mine in high school. We ended up becoming friends with benefits and he reiterated he only saw me as a friend but I kept answering the late night booty calls hoping it would become more if we just hung out enough and he saw how compatible we were. Never happened.
6,Ok
7,"&gt;Yes it‚Äôs selfish, but humans make selfish decisions all the time

Well. Yes. So that would prettt much be the end of the discussion. But the post is about our thoughts on the matter and my initial comment is based on the assumption that being selfish is bad."
8,"I've not done the whole tinder thing but bars were easiest for me or just having a few fwbs, which I think can work a bit better just less hassle. "

10,"Oh lord I can't even imagine how bad it must for women whose jobs involve touching others, even if it's just their hair. Every hairdresser I've known has been tough as nails. "
11,"I am sorry you had to go through that, it doesn't never gets easier, but we gotta enjoy our good days üòÄü§ó

"
12,"I was going to reply and say, ""In my opinion as a hater of any and all facial hair, *every* man looks better clean shaven"", but then I remembered Kit Harington and how he looks more like himself with his Jon Snow fuzz.

So, every man but Kit Harington."
13,"Using femininity as insults.  Being weak = being a p****.  Being assertive = being a b****.  Being in touch with your emotions or caring about your appearance = being girly.  There's no better way to insult someone than by calling them a woman.  

I'm still unlearning this one myself.  It's harder than it sounds."
14,I didn‚Äôt used to think that tonsil stones were a big deal until I mentioned it to my family and they all made fun of me... now I feel bad about it and don‚Äôt mention it.
15,"Maybe my story will be a little strange.

My husband and I come from a very conservative country. Our marriage was arranged. Well, more specifically, I'd call it ""forced"" because I was never asked for consent, neither by mine nor his parents. My husband was also not asked for consent. 

The engagement lasted 3 months. I didn't know him before the engagement. When I first met him on our engagement day (which was a simple dinner), I didn't like his family, and I didn't like him either. He was physically attractive, but kind of looked somewhat 'rough', older, so I got all the wrong first impressions. He is in fact only 4 years older, but I was 18 at the time. 

I didn't want to get married to him and I cried a lot during the engagement phase. I didn't see him much back then. We did go for a walk a couple of times ( supervised by my mother) , but we didn't have any private time together, to actually talk. These walks didn't put me at ease about him. 

There were also some stories about his family (his brother was a wife beater)

I dare to say that I was also a little more educated than girls my age at that time (I used to read a lot, spend a lot of time on the internet and I don't mean social media), so I didn't like the idea of being forced into something AT ALL. 

Well, we got married three months into our engagement. I didn't want to sleep with him on the first wedding night. He didn't object at all and was understanding of it, actually. So he slept on some super uncomfortable sofa next to the master bed. Well, we didn't sleep together for the next few weeks, actually. I kind of needed time to relax, and he never said a word about it. :) 

The beginning of our marriage was great, to be honest! We had a lot of fun together. We watched tons of movies. We went to many trips. Once he sneaked alcohol into the house (we lived with his parents) and I got drunk for the first time, in the bedroom. And many other things. 

I fell in love with him over time. :) 

He finished his college education while still in our home country, and we moved to Europe 4 years after the wedding (I initiated it) . We have managed to adjust to the 'western lifestyle'. He supported my tertiary education (in Europe) and he worked really really hard for me to get my degree ; it was a tough time. But I graduated and earned a Bachelor's degree. :) I was unemployed for a very long time, but he never once complained.

Now I do have a job. He has a great job. We finally live in a big apartment. We've been together for 10 years in total. We can afford all sorts of stuff. 

We also got a dog 1 year ago. It's a stray dog. At first he hated the idea of having a dog in the apartment, but now he plays with him even more than I do. :) 

That's about it. :) 

"
16,"I have some joint mobility problems. They will sometimes move too far in the wrong direction. It's a wet sensation. It hurts, but in a wet way. Describing pain as wet grosses people the fuck out for some reason, as does joints doing what they're not supposed to do. I'll get ""eeeeeeww"" responses. "
17,Thanks! And LOL I feel the same way
18,Blood relation is not an obligation. 
19,Do the responses bother you? 
20,"Not always. Some makeup palettes can be limited edition releases and sell out fast. And if she has multiple palettes she probably is into makeup a bit. Not to mention how expensive some of them are, like a Natasha Denona palette is $130, some are $200. I don‚Äôt think this is just dealing with anger, that is scary. If my ex did something like that to me I would get a restraining order. "
21,"Neither sexier or less sexy when he is heavier. I wouldn't use the word chunky. Sounds cheesy I know but its him that's sexy, not 15-20 lbs more or less. "
22,"Mine isn't a lack of intelligence.  I don't notice women flirting with me or checking me out, while friends tell me it happens fairly often.  See also my lack of confidence.  ""What, she just asked me out? Must be a prank.""

To be fair this actually was a setup for a prank that was pulled on me in High School.  Some guys got a beautiful woman to ask me out, and then have her break up with me in the lunch room the next day.  "

Referring to another co-worker.

But he's probably just an asshole "

42,"Ouch. This hits close to home.

I'm pretty sure I don't love him romantically anymore and haven't for a while. I love him deeply, like a family member, like those identical twins who can't bear to be away from each other, but the romance and attraction is completely gone. The idea of sex and kissing him is... at the least, boring and at the most, unpleasant.

He on the other hand is still *incredibly* attracted to me, loyal, forgiving of all my flaws, supportive, would make such a caring and great father, shares so many of my life goals and ideas, provides so much stability to my incredibly unstable life....

I don't know what to do. I'm scared I'll be alone or never find someone else like him again. I recoil at the thought of him with someone else. Fuck. 

I'm so sorry I just unloaded this onto your comment. I'm hoping someone stumbles onto this and can give some advice. "
43,"that's sweet. I'm glad you guys are able to talk things out in such a healthy way! bickering because of outside stress is a common theme in this thread and in my own relationship also. 

also, drinking milk is also gross in my opinion. lol

"

53,I daydream about besting up people/zombies/monsters etc. I don't know what part of my personality it comes from but it isn't one i would share because telling someone you just imagined smashing someone through a computer screen isn't socially appropriate. 
54,"A lot of period stuff! I've been on my damn period for 2 weeks now because of the depo shot. Except I'm not fully bleeding. I'm just...spotting? Sometimes it's enough to make a mark on my panties. Sometimes it's not. I haven't had time or energy to get myself to my gynecologist and it sucks.

oh and bile poops. since i don't have a gallbladder anymore, my bowel movements are all weird and sometimes really damn urgent because of the constant bile moving through my digestive tract :'D"
55,"Yeah.  I high school, I took my first real break up REALLY hard.  I kept wanting to ""be friends"" with him, when really I just had no idea how to disengage.  I was a creep for a while - showing up at the fast food place he worked, trying to call him all the time (yeah, this was BEFORE TEXTING).  Eventually I got over it, and leaving for college helped seal the deal as far as leaving him alone.  

We all make mistakes when we're young.  "
56,"Don't look in mine and I won't look in yours. But I think there's a huge difference between looking through a phone as a girlfriend and looking as a wife. If a husband had an issue with it, he will get the side eye and probably won't be able to redeem himself in my eyes. I don't want to be with someone that I can't trust. "
57,"normally I wouldn‚Äôt be as embarrassed about it, but I went from having the flu, straight to my pollen allergy being set off, then to bronchitis, so it‚Äôs been like six weeks straight of coughing so hard my heart hearts, then having a panic about how hard I peed THIS time. I‚Äôve been downing Mucinex like Jell-O shots and doing pelvic exercises like my doctor suggested, but it‚Äôs slow going."
58,Hah. I got that from a guy that flirted with me and didn‚Äôt get with me 
59,"It's bickering about trivial stuff when we're stressed out, including how stressed out we are. I rarely remember the details of the argument, but at some point it usually stops when go ""Are you really doing this right now? Are we doing this??"" when I've got like no energy left. "
60,"üôÑ is usually my response. The best one is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre married? How old are you, 15?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind people thinking I‚Äôm younger but I‚Äôm almost 28 and it‚Äôs get crazy annoying when people make comments about how I can‚Äôt possibly be old enough to be married. I usually just smile and say thank you but it‚Äôs getting old."
61,"lol. honestly, she should've just stolen the pallettes if she wanted to be petty. the momentum from a falling object from 15 floors could've seriously hurt someone. üò≠"
62,Some guys look a lot worse with a beard and some look a lot better. All about face shape. 
63,Really?
64,"Shaving plus epilator. You don't need to shave unless you get lazy as the epilator hurts on longer hair. It took me a while to find out that you can really reduce the pain by epilating daily starting with short hair. (So that there are less hairs each time) Legs feel like they're waxed (used to do that) 
Exfoliate with a salux cloth (don't get a Chinese knock off it's a completely different texture)
Avoid perfumed body washes if you're sensitive "
65,"I think of that about the same way I think of bank robbery or auto theft. It is a crime. It is illegal, Perhaps we should have better law enforcement, or perhaps we have good law enforcement because people were caught.

What bothers me much more is when a university will give priority to children of major donors. That is legal, and it is being done. Donate $500,000 (or often far less) to a prestigious university and your kids will be accepted.

What also bothers me is the way some universities give preference to ""legacy applicants"", kids whose parents are alumni of the school. That make it easier for kids with means to get accepted over kids whose parents did not go to college."
66,I can't think of one.
67,"Many years ago a coworker decided to joke around and google another coworker who was a complete jackass. Turned out about a decade before he was on a tv show where he was kicked off for a violent offense that was caught on camera. I‚Äôm friends with the guy on LinkedIn and he keeps changing his name, his first and middle names are acronyms now cus he keeps getting linked to the video. The dudes a complete jackass so I don‚Äôt feel bad that he can‚Äôt shrug off his image. For reference, he‚Äôs tripped me multiple times while I was walking and he sprayed my coffee with windex and then gave it to me.... yeah"
68,"We talk crap to each other, and that really does help let out steam without arguing. Big arguments are usually after a few months, we're really good at communicating."
69,I have the intro song to That 70's Show stuck in my head and I've never even seen the show!!
70,I honestly can't remember the last time we got in an argument. We've been together so long it's like we're a hive mind now.
71,Path of Exile 
72,"The game I always end up going back to is The Misadventures of Tron Bonne. I love games where I can be the villain\~y character, but that character is also adorable."
73,may I ask how the dynamic is when you disagree? are you both laid back people? 
74,I'm a kindergarten teacher. I've never been sexually harassed by my coworkers. But my students will graze my leg or butt when they hug me or just because they're little and don't understand boundaries yet. 
75,Nearly all of them 
76,"Yes! These are probably the same assholes that don't say thank you when you hold the door open for them

YOUR WELCOME!"
77,"Thank you for pointing me in the direction of this, I always love hearing superior parodies to songs I dislike."
78,"I say thanks but I internally, I‚Äôm rolling my eyes depending on who‚Äôs saying it. I think that a lot of people are just blowing smoke up my ass. I‚Äôm 31, and while I don‚Äôt think I look ‚Äúold‚Äù I also don‚Äôt think I look 16. I‚Äôm very short and small so I think that plays into it, and I‚Äôve still got those round cheeks, but I really don‚Äôt look like a high schooler. "
79,"Def the Witcher series! I also always seem to go back to Skyrim as well. The new God of War and Assassin's Creed (Origins) are also one of my new favorites. I need to check out Red Dead as everyone loves it, I feel like i'm missing out"
80,Just looked myself up...I‚Äôm negative two years old. WTF
81,"She needs to get in here and explain herself, send her a link. And then lock your doors"
82,Of course and I do find him physically attractive. His physique changing in one direction or the other doesn't alter his attractiveness to me. I'm going to chomp on his freckles either way. 
83,I say ‚Äúthis is NAME.‚Äù And my friends usually know about the drama of my sex life anyway 
84,"I wish, thank you for your kind words "
85,My past abuse and assault.
86,"If he‚Äôs smiling or not, if he‚Äôs standing up straight with open body language. How comfortable he seems in his environment"
87,"I style it well and use the proper products. Waist length here, I rarely wear it up."
88,"To me, that's not about love as much as it is about respecting and caring about people as human individuals. If I find someone sexy, going a few clothing sizes in either direction isn't going to change that. "
89,Learn to appreciate simple things in life. Learn to forgive people and move on. I'm turning 29 this month. 
90,"If it's any consolation: I'm glad you got out. So very glad you got out because many don't leave relationships like those alive. If she was willing to hurt your puppers, who is defenseless and innocent, I can't imagine what she would have eventually done to you (or had done to you). Hopefully your next relationship goes much better. Sending lot of good vibes!!!"
91,I feel like I was born thirsty. I swear I drink like 3L of water a day.
92,"Veterinary medicine. The fact that its 90% female probably helps. I know women can be guilty of sexual harassment as well, but I think it makes it less likely."
93,"Way back in highschool I had a crush on this boy who was socially awkward. I was too. He was weird and hot and cold about giving me attention which I should have known was a sign he wasn't into me. All of my friends kept encouraging me that he was interested, I kept catching him watching me in class which they said 'was a sign'. I tried asking him to prom after we started hanging out and doing games together. I told him if he didn't want to go with me it was okay, but I just wanted to know if it was a yes or no. He never got back to me and proceeded to avoid me around school. In hindsight I could see that he was sometimes trying to brush me off. I saw him once at community college and he literally booked it from me, bolted off like I was a stalker. I feel bad if I made him that uncomfortable lol but I would have been fine with a rejection. It was the not knowing that made it hard to read? Once I knew I definitely backed off for good."
94,". I heard that a couple of times actually.

""Yeah, everyone says that"".

Maybe it's a stupid answer, but I don't know what else to say. "
95,Way back in the 90‚Äôs before caller ID was ubiquitous I called the man I was crazy for often when he would have been home from work. Problem was he worked second shift and he lived with his sister and I was calling at 12:30 am and I would hang up if she answered. After about two weeks of this nonsense he called me and asked if I called the night before. I said how did you know and he told me they added caller ID which was an extra charge because I was waking his sister up so often. My face turned flaming red after typing this all of these years later!
96,You should read about the curly girl method if you haven't given it a try! My hair is wavy and I've never had such defined curls with no frizz. 
97,"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I‚Äôm 30 and I think my tattoos are one of the main reasons people don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm 16. Yeah it‚Äôs kinda annoying, but I dress how I want and look how I look. I‚Äôm not changing because other people don‚Äôt know what a teenager actually looks like."
98,my sexual assaulter
99,Generally showing lots of emotion. Whether I'm really happy or really sad I don't like to show it
100,"I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with 70s fashion, and I‚Äôm telling everyone I know that flared jeans are back until they come back (they are a bit, but not extensively). Honestly, flared jeans/trousers are the best."

My mom wasn't aware of this (she thought Frank was her biological father) until she was in her teens (funny thing: same thing happened to me. Odd how history repeats itself...I guess?) My grandma and Frank eventually divorced and she married Fil and had my mom's sister. My grandma grew up on a farm in Illinois. They lost everything in the Depression. Her mother was bipolar and died in an institution. My grandma is an odd bird. She's kind to me but wavers between kind and emotionally absent to her children. They desperately seek her approval. I don't think they'll ever get it, at least not verbally.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma Fil grew up DIRT poor in the midwest. His dad died when he was young--he was an alcoholic, was drunk and decided to go for a swim and drowned. His mom remarried to an abusive guy (family lore is she ran a brothel in between husbands but I've seen no evidence of that in my genealogical searches) and my grandpa left as soon as he could. He became a migrant farm worker, working his way across the country to CT. At one of the farms (not sure where), he caught the eye of the farm owner's wife (not in a sexual way I think, more in just a curious way). He was one of the most handsome men I've ever seen (seriously movie star looks) and very charming and smart. The farm owner's wife took pity on him, took him into her home and sponsored his education; he eventually went to MIT. He became extraordinarily successful and founded a company that eventually became Gulf + Western. He was a weird guy, aloof and extremely cruel to my mom, but extremely loving to his other biological child, my mom's sister, to the point of infatuation. He was always nice to me but we never had a strong bond.

&amp;#x200B;

Fil also happened to be gay (closeted) and a cross-dresser. My grandmother knew, and I think other family members had inklings, but the extent of it was uncovered when he died and we found lots of letters he had written to men and all of his female clothes and shoes. It was so tragic that he was forced to keep this a secret due to what a stigma it was at the time. He was a very unhappy man.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more family drama/history but I don't want to bore anyone with rambling on!"
104,Most in my opinion. 
105,"I don't actively hide much. If he asks, I'll tell him. But he has to ask, and I have to feel comfortable enough to talk about it. (Same for him, I would never push him to talk about something he's not okay with talking about)

That being said, I don't foresee myself actually talking about some of the abusive situations I've been in. I know I should, since it still affects me, but it's hard for me to imagine looking him in the eye and talking about childhood trauma."
106,A guy did. Biggest. Mistake. Of my life. 
107,That took a good turn in the end. Nice. 
108,"3 to 7 mins IS premature, especially if sex is over after that. At least finish the job SOMEHOW"
109,We were exclusive from day one. He proposed 5 months later. Married a month after that. Been happily together now for 5 1/2 years.
110,This is adorable.
111,[removed]
112,Same. I am not a smart man.
113,Small isnt an issue. There are probably other aspects of your personality that you downplay.
114,"Back before the days of smart phones and whatever else, there was a guy I had a crush on who worked at the gym where I occasionally competed in gymnastics. One day I sat there and actually worked out his entire rota by working out if he‚Äôd been there when I was and figured out his pattern. In retrospect I‚Äôm both cringing and proud of 11 year old me."
115,"Go for it, see the world if that's your calling. You'll still have the option to come back later when you realise that people in NZ have it really good. Or you might fall in love with a new place, a different kind of lifestyle. I can assure you that you won't regret chasing your dreams, even if they turn out to be less than ideal."
116,"When I'm talking to someone and they feel the need to either hit or nudge me to get my full attention. Like dude, stop. I'm already engaged in a conversation with you. There is absolutely no reason for you to be physically touching me. Ugh."
117,That's so funny! I honestly hardly know anyone who legitimately planned their children but my Mom and some of my religious friends. 
118,Yes! üòÇ All on my iPhone and in my cubicle. 
119,"I go to the coffee shop down the street from my house often. Last week, my bf and I were walking up to the coffee shop discussing the DJ we were going to see that night. Upon walking in, invited the barista to the show with us. She did not show. 

The next time I saw her at the coffee shop she came outside to where I was sitting with my dog and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I didn‚Äôt come to the show. I woke up feeling like a flake. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs usually creepy when people try to be friends with us.‚Äù Then she went on to assure me I seem like a normal person. 

So I was flat out called creepy and this happened very recently. 

How the hell do people make friends these days in real life? "
120,"From my perspective I don‚Äôt have a bad personality, I never have attitudes never have. I‚Äôm very grateful. Always spoil and treat people by buying them everything they want. Only thing is I‚Äôm slightly shy but"
121,"my boss expecting me to do 1000% more work than I was told I would be doing. Like I am a recruiter, but now I am doing research, making marketing materials, and graphic design (which I have no idea how to do)"
122,Because he is an amazing person despite having an annoying habit? 
123,Gesaffelstein - [So Bad](https://open.spotify.com/track/2qre5YuCk0fuKw0Z60E28W) (feat. HAIM).
124,Go ahead.
125,But why about gradual weight gain like 30lbs over 3 years 
126,"I feel very comfortable telling him anything so I can't think of what I would hide, other than a few embarrassing moments from the past that I'm not eager to share with anyone. "
127,"No I wouldn't, not at all. My husband has gained some weight throughout our relationship and yet I'm more sexually attracted to him than ever because we are emotionally closer than ever. "
128,"I don‚Äôt really understand it - as I‚Äôm firmly against children myself, and doing it independently just makes things harder.

I have no problems if the mother is capable of handling it, but that‚Äôs not always the case. 

However, it‚Äôs not as if its any worse than a couple having a child they can‚Äôt handle."
129,That's great to hear. I'm sure he doesn't see it as you dumping on him. He's probably happy to be a safe space to/for you. Not everyone's lucky enough to have that. 
130,"There was a kid that was a little older than me when I was 7 that I had a huuuge crush on. Ran into him again (small world) several years later but only said hi. Another good 15 years later or so I had a dream about him and decided to look him up. Couldn't remember his last name so I looked up his parents name on the county property appraisers site. I finally found him on Facebook and saw he was going thru a divorce and had 2 kids so of course crazy me thinks, ""Bingo! This is my chance!"" So I couldn't find his number but I found his mom's phone number online and called her and chatted with her for a while and tried to get the scoop on him, which I did because southern elderly ladies loooove gossiping. She gave me his number and I called him once and he never called me back but I figured more than 1 call would be super creepy. I stalk him on Facebook every once in a while but I haven't tried to reach out again but now I'm happily married anyways. It's AMAZING what you can find out about people if you know where to look."
131,"Most of my thoughts have already been mentioned so I'll focus on another aspect of it: the proof that celebrities are as bad as bankers/CEOS. I had a whole rant typed out but I decided to keep it brief.  We rage against the CEO making millions a year but say nothing at the actor pulling in that same paycheck for substantially less work.  We make fun of Donald Trump for his web of nepotism but don't say boo to the fact that a huge number of people who succeeded in Hollywood did so in large part due to a personal connection, especially family.  We separate celebrities as on the good side, but when it comes to issues of wealth/income/opportunity inequality, they are firmly in bed with the rest of the 1%.  When Hollywood, which is heavily unionized, goes on strike in support of other unions, or lobbies against anti-union legislation, then I'll change my tune. 

&amp;#x200B;"
132,"If they can take care of the child: why not? By taking care I mean financially, mentally and emotionally. I think a woman needs to be very stable to take care of a kid herself."
133,"Find ways to care less about it. Even though the anxiety is about caring too much about how other people view you, they really don't care as much as you think. Ironically the fact that you're emotionally invested in someone you don't know is probably why you have that anxiety in the first place."
134,Don't care as long as they don't want me to babysit. 
135,"If you're in the wedding industry, you should know it's spelled fiancee when it's a woman just fyi."
136,Don‚Äôt wow okay me...
137,You can love someone but not in a relationship way and I realized that too late. 
138,"Every time I've met someone I met online, it's gone great. I actually have plans to do it twice more this year.

It's always a little bizarre how much it feels like it's not the first time. You're so familiar with them, it feels natural, but you're also keenly aware that you haven't _actually_ hung out before. Or at least, that's how it always feels for me. "
139,"Oh you‚Äôre right, I read it as a shared appt"
140,"Well, that's the difficult part. By the sounds of it this is as ready as you'll ever get. You already know that it has to be done. Have a big talk with him, a really honest one about what he and you want from life. Make it clear that it's a serious talk and that you're thinking of ending it. Sometimes you have to endure the pain of a breakup to be able to grow and follow your own dreams. The more you postpone this, the harder it's gonna be."
141,"I was also a creeper to my boyfriend (now husband). I recently found a notebook where I had hand written every text he sent me in the first couple months of dating. This was back when smartphones weren‚Äôt a thing and you had to manually delete texts every couple of days, but still."
142,It's better to be alone than disrespected. 
143,"Go for it, but be aware that it‚Äôs hard. My ex and I split when my son was 3 months, he left the country to get as far away from us as he could. Thankfully, as he is a bit of a twat. My lad is 22 now and a delight. Kind, generous, patient, employed, qualities that were important to me as a parent. I didn‚Äôt choose to raise him on my own, but I did and he is great. It was really fucking hard. Worth every tear. The thing to remember is your job is parent, not baby sitter. Baby‚Äôs are not toys. Getting a new partner should not be your focus, it‚Äôs not ok to dump the kid with sitters so you can hook up. It is important to ensure you have downtime. Kids need socialising so if you don‚Äôt have friends with kids find a group.  They don‚Äôt learn to share, communicate or stand up for themselves if they don‚Äôt interact with their peers. "
144,"I agree. The lyrics aren‚Äôt great but it‚Äôs so freaking catchy and even when I don‚Äôt hear it, it‚Äôs stuck in my head. 

I just looked up the lyrics now tho because I never knew what she said at the end of the chorus. Just sounds like ‚Äúat night she‚Äôs screaming ma ma ma ma ma ma‚Äù but apparently it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAt night she's screamin' I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind‚Äù


Which is kinda weird. The whole song is kinda odd."
145,Like what type of bigger? 
146,"They definitely do. I am usually the chillest lady ever until some doofus starts acting up and making me feel crazy. Then I find myself doing whatever I have to, ethical or not, to find the truth. It's awful. "
147,You‚Äôre probably right. This whole thing has been a giant misunderstanding. 
148,bloodborne for sure - all the dark souls games are good but this one hits different
149,"I had a job interview in a location where people need to sign in/out. I knew they were doing back-to-back interviews, so when I returned my visitor‚Äôs badge, I took note of the other names on the sign in list for that department that day. Later, I checked out my competition on LinkedIn.

I did not get the job, and although I am pretty sure that it was because of how I answered one particular question, the paranoid part of me has wondered ever since if someone noticed me checking out the other names on the list and that disqualified me. Would not take that risk again! The paranoid regret wasn‚Äôt worth the momentary false sense of control.

I have also checked out the LinkedIn profiles of people who got hired instead of me, where the organization lists the staff online. Nine times out of ten, that has made me feel better, because I can clearly see a reason why the person they hired was a better choice than me in some respect. But sometimes, the person they hired seems far less qualified than me, and knowing that just fed my sense of impotent rage and hopelessness.

I have found looking for a job really demoralizing."
150,"A. That women have to wear make-up to be attractive.

B. That women who wear make-up religiously are lying to men.

Both are harmful and bullshit, and degrade women's choices to do or not do whatever they want with their own damn bodies."
151,"She may not be psychotic, but the act certainly was. Stable people do not behave like that. "
152,"My SO and I decided to do that, but we had infertility issues and ended up marrying first, no kids yet (oddly enough, my sister and BIL also tried and failed to have kids without marriage).

It's a very common and normal choice to make in our families and in our culture at large. We grew up with tons of models of happy stable families started that way and there was never an expectation that we would marry (before kids or at all). So it wasn't a huge life-changing decision for us.

For us, the decision came down to the fact that having children was/is a top priority in our life, while getting married wasn't since marriage wouldn't change much for us anyway. Having kids is time-sensitive, but getting married isn't, so when push came to shove, it just made more sense to have kids first.

"
153,You aren‚Äôt fat!!! You don‚Äôt know what fat really is until college.
154,Oh man. Med school is tough. I'm in a STEM degree too so I can relate
155,Have confidence in yourself and stop thinking about what people can think about you. The more you do that the more you'll lose confidence and the less you'll be happy about yourself later.
156,"No because I'm not a sexist, heteronormative piece of shit "
157,"It depends on what boundaries you and your partner have for each other. If they see it as serious as cheating, then that‚Äôs that, and it‚Äôs inappropriate. If you and your partner are in an open type relationship, and both parties agree to what‚Äôs going, then that‚Äôs fine. "
158,You‚Äôre definitely bisexual
159,Starving yourself wont solve any of the problems in your life-- itll just cause 5+ years of mental &amp; physical pain &amp; youll spend the rest of your life trying to pick up the pieces
160,"What! That's crazy. I'm jealous. Out of curiosity, what kind of info do doctors need to be able to determine that? Just you saying your fine after 2 hrs of sleep a night?"
161,Learn to be on your own.
162,First time I had sex with this guy I was dating he was talking waaaaay to dirty and it was a huge turn off. 
163,Try The Power by Naomi Alderman. It's another feminist dystopian novel but kind of flips the Handmaid's Tale on its head.
164,I'm a dude but I love these picks more than typical hardcore porn. The romantic sensual ones gets me much more because of the intimacy and sense of love than empty fucking
165,"1) Don't get back together with your ex  
2) St. Ives Apricot Scrub is not a daily facewash, please take care of your skin  
3) Tell someone about what you're going through, they won't hate who you are and there are medicines to help that shit  
4) Take more pictures and let people take pictures of you  
5) Stand up for yourself when your friends aren't acting friendly. It's better to end a friendship than it is to let them make you feel like shit.  
6) Start using a cup. I know it's scary but it'll make things so much easier."
166,"&gt;Finding heart emoji ???? Inappropriate is the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard.

Seconded. It's a way to express gratitude, or even platonic affection for me, not in any way does it have an only romantic meaning to me."
167,When I Was Older is my go to ‚Äúrelax song‚Äù right now 
168,I looked up a cute guy on Facebook several years ago. Ended up accidentally identifying myself in his profile picture.

It wasn't that I thought I wouldn't get out of it, but it felt like it went on and on and on forever, took a toll on my sense of worth, finances, attitude, sense of free time/ accomplishment...

178,"....so you‚Äôre just assuming OP is saying something that they decidedly *didn‚Äôt* say, because society? In other words a man cannot ask a group of women how any of them feel about something? Huh"
179,Calling their female friend sexy would only be acceptable as a form of banter not as actual flirting. 
180,"1. It will get better. 
2. Focus on yourself, start doing some research about your interests, find new passions and proceed with them. 
3. Yes, you have been bullied in the past, but trust me, they are people who likes you, who wants to be your friends. So stop becoming friends with selfish and toxic people, who isolate you and make you feel even worst. Later in life this will backfire at you in the worst way.
4. This boy with his stupid card tricks, which approached you and your ex-best friend on the break - he liked you. He was looking at you. Because you are not as ugly, as you think you are. Christ, he did approached you more than once and he was asking after you. You are not ugly.
5. Stop overthinking. I promise, it really will get better.

Like I said, I don't really agree with what OP did but I applaud her for owning up to it, recognizing it was wrong, and taking steps to make sure she never does that again. I just don't like this attitude of this poor other girl ""caught in the crosshairs"". "

188,"I'm not downvoting you or anything but I am genuinely curious, why do you think your opinion matters in a sub that is literally called ""AskWomen?"" Btw, I am not saying you're wrong. I just don't get why people like you comment AT ALL.

I don't like it when men comment on r/AskWomen. Period. I also don't like it when women comment on AskMen, but that isn't the same. Wanna know why? Men don't need a space designated for them &amp; only them on the internet; the internet was ALREADY an extremely male-dominated space. When reddit was first created, men outnumbered women on this site by MASSIVE numbers. I haven't checked what the ratio of women to men is on reddit these days, but it's entirely possible that women are still outnumbered on this site despite being ~50% of the population. 

To this day, decades after the internet was created &amp; after reddit was created, people automatically assume just about every reddit user is a man unless given information (typically in their comment or post) stating/implying otherwise. Not to mention the fact that throughout most of history, the ~50% of the population with a vagina has been opressed, &amp; continue to be opressed to this day to varying degrees, all around the world.

Society, the internet, &amp; specifically reddit is a male-dominated space. I would like this subreddit MUCH more if men didn't comment or post ever (unless asking a question), so that this ONE space on reddit that's dedicated to us could actually be, ya know, for us. &amp; my feelings are not invalid, no matter what your opinion is. They're not right or wrong, they're just my subjective feelings, &amp; whether you agree or disagree, it doesn't make my feelings any more or less valid.

(Tl;dr: sometimes, whether you are right or wrong, it is not your place to interject with your opinions.)"

200,"1. Start going to your church regularly and mingle. You will meet your true friends.
2. Let go of the friends you believe are your real ones because they are not and they will betray you. 
3. That guy you will eventually get to know in church. He's not the one. He's far too lost for you and you'll see later you guys are nowhere near compatible.
4. CARE FOR YOURSELF and stop trying to find your worth in boys.
5. In 4 years you'll meet a guy who will sweep you off your feet and seem like he's the most careful and loving guy. He's a junkie, he's not worth your time. He will not love you. Stay away. "

One thing that will save you much pain - when you do your internship, your last ride with the transportation service, INSIST that you sit in the front. Don't try to be accomodating and sit with the creepy guy in the back. I beg you. Make up any excuse to sit in the front, but do it. If they won't let you, tell them you feel sick and walk home. Believe me. 

I wish I could tell you how to prevent all the other situations, but most of them are out of your control. But please know that you have survived all of them. You are stronger than you think, more intelligent than you give yourself credit for, and you have a kind heart.

The only consistent home issue we argue about is domestic labor. I'm naturally very clean and have super high standards, he was raised by a mother that never taught him household chores because ""kids should be having fun"".

"
249,"This is absurd. 

I'm a non-white guy (Asian). I had a near-perfect SAT. 

Maybe the SAT was racially advantageous to white Americans. So what? 

Nothing that can't be overcome with hard work. I worked insanely hard at school - got a 4.2 weighted GPA, near perfect SAT scores and perfect SAT2 scores. 

I never used my race as an excuse. I worked damn hard, like the other 20,000 people who got near-perfect SAT scores.

250,"when I was very young (14), I had a crush on this internet friend of mine, A. we had been talking for several months and I really started to fall for him hard, despite never meeting him in person or anything. anyways, I think after a while he picked up on my feelings even though I never overtly told him, and he ended up talking to me far less.

I ended up sending him a bunch of emotionally charged emails, some of them while drunk (I used to break into my parent's liquor cabinet which was definitely a mistake) and I even went as far as to track down where he went to school and his facebook profile (even though I never did anything with this information, just found it). Of course, after this, he ghosted me completely.

looking back, that was all hella creepy and probably super uncomfortable for him, especially since we only knew each other from the internet."

254,"I've actually read a bit about this recently. I have mixed feelings. As we know, the words are borrowed from the French language. While Fianc√©e is proper when referring to a woman, it's becoming more common to use Fianc√© in the English language since we do not really use (many) gender biased nouns in this language. Especially in modern times where it's becoming more and more common to be gender neutral with terms like ""waiter/waitress"" and ""actor/actress"" and ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" vs. ""partner."" 

It's still advised to use it in writing because it helps to distinguish the gender between the two partners. I used to use fianc√©e since it's the proper French term, but ultimately I'm torn on whether or not the distinguishment should matter in the first place. I also lean towards ""partner"" instead of boyfriend/girlfriend for the same reasons."
255,"We are taking about statistics. We are not talking about the 10%. We are talking in medians and  majorities. Of course there's always one person in any population whose sole desire is to eat toilet paper. We are not talking about those people. Im talking about IN GENERAL. Hence MOST. Statistics say 90% of men masturbate. So we have a faint idea what MOST men want out of an experience machine. But only 50% of women do, so that part is more or less shrouded in mystery.   "

I'm extremely practiced at coming across as reliable, and people who don't know me well seem to think I'm on top of my shit.

5 years into our relationship I was diagnosed with adhd (and related anxiety), so all this hiding and perfectionism that I've developed over the course of my life really started to make sense to me.

I still hate asking for help even when it would make things 10x easier. That's the most irrational thing I do. "

When I was 18 I flew from NM to NYC to meet my LDR. He flaked and broke up with me. After growing up I'm pretty sure he was either catfishing or lying somehow, but had a good two week vacation by myself! 

Second and third times I flew to meet a guy in California. We had a good time, met his fam, went on dates, hooked up. I moved nearby and we continued seeing eachother for a while but after a year we broke up.  It was crappy but I got to change my life because of him and met my current SO. :) "

He‚Äôs probably in the other X apt number. they were so nice and not bothered by it but i imagined if that happened to me and my roomies we‚Äôd end up pepper spraying someone. it would be really scary if a man just knocked on ur door and barged in when u open it "
278,The easiest way for me was to stop buying sugar to eat at home. And only give myself the option of I go out. I didn't have sugary snacks (or any snacks) at home or soft drinks etc. But I allowed myself to eat what I wanted when I was out with friends.

295,"I think a good amount of that is virtue signaling honestly. Or, in other words, not entirely genuine. I don‚Äôt think cultural attitudes have genuinely changed as much as people pretend they have.

But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair to expect somebody to wait until they find a good partner. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair to expect somebody to wait until they have a decent stable income or to wait until they finish their education or whatever else they need to do before they can provide a child with the quality of life they deserve. To insist on having a child when you are unable to provide adequately for it just because you feel like it would make *you* happy, in my opinion is selfish. I mean this is a whole individual person‚Äôs entire life we‚Äôre talking about here, not a goldfish."

299,"I once had to spend eight days in a tiny room in the back of the ER with no TV or windows and wasn't allowed to leave my bed except to go to the restroom, which I had to do supervised.

The staff seemed really annoyed with me being there, because I successfully turned down a hospital they were trying to involuntarily commit me in (I'd been in this hospital in the past and got the shit kicked out of me by some other patients) because they forgot to file the involuntary comittal paperwork. 

So I decided to just try to fuck with them all when they had me comitted behind my back. 

I refused to bathe. I broke shit. I made up elaborate (fictional) stories about being raised in a cannibal colt. And when the sitters wouldn't have a normal, happy conversation, I would just stare at them, only stopping to blink, usually their entire shift.

I was really angry and bored so this all made sense to do at the time. 

In retrospect it's cringey as fuck. But I saw no way out of my situation until the involuntary hold ran out. So it really did feel justified. 

I also reported the charge nurse for a HIPPAA violation (which she was technically guilty of) and had an investigation started against her. But it was really mostly just out of spite. 

The really awkward part of that is that this hospital is the closest one to where I live by a long shot. 

I've had to take my kids in there on occasion and have been back as a patient myself. And every single time I'm there, that damn charge nurse is there. .

I always try to make smalltalk with her. She never seems interested. "

330,"As a fellow impulsive person I've learned to write everything I want to say in a Word document and edit the hell out of it until I have what I want to say just right. Then I tell the person I'm addressing that I have something important to say and if they'll please keep all questions or outbursts to themselves while I read off the page. DONT DEVIATE FROM YOUR SCRIPT.

Also, try to brainstorm a FAQ ahead of time and consider well thought out answers as best as possible so that nothing you say sounds rude or off hand.

Obviously this gets better with practice but at least you'll have some control."

339,Yea he does. And hes trying to lose it. Hes just enjoying being retired and smokes weed for ptsd soooo munchies galore. 
340,"She was throwing shade the entire day. She made it seem like I‚Äôm a 14 year old little girl that‚Äôs still in high school. I‚Äôm an adult, in college and am only 4 years younger than her son. She also kept grilling me about my life and questioning him on why he‚Äôs with me like I wasn‚Äôt sitting right there listening to everything she‚Äôs saying. The icing on the cake was when everybody was opening Christmas presents and she said she didn‚Äôt get me anything because she didn‚Äôt know I was coming then she gave me a $5 bill from her purse  because she didn‚Äôt want me to feel left out and said ‚ÄúThis is all I have, you can put it towards a school book or something.‚Äù She was like this all day with her smart ass remarks, shady comments and just negativity towards me the whole time for no reason.

349,I want to make the switch - from an environmental perspective primarily but also to feel less of what the OP said generally. I‚Äôm worried about my laziness with sanitation and then emptying/cleaning in a public place.
350,You speak the truth 
351,Had a girl call me her ex's name twice while she was climaxing on my bed. Never lost an erection so quick. 
352,"Well, there's no guarantee we end up in the same spot... it's entirely dependent on a few job prospects I am vying for right now. In addition and more importantly, there's still more than a year left before she might end up in the place I'm planning to move toward... and that's plenty of time remaining for either of us to change, move on, and so on. It is also dependent that she doesn't just go back home either, but actively tries to move to the place we both wanted to go to. "
353,"None of my friends or family have been toxic towards me. This was a guy I was seeing, he was pretty emotionally screwed before meeting me, and didn‚Äôt know how to treat someone with respect. Every argument he thought he played no part in, and I was the one and only instigator. Was messed up but it‚Äôs done now, now and then I get glimpses of missing him. "
354,I‚Äôm 20 and get told that I look about 14-15 regularly. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô8‚Äù and average weight (if not a bit lanky) but really babyfaced. I usually just laugh awkwardly and say nothing about the fact that I absolutely hate my face shape.
355,"A few times a week, and about leaving recycling on the counter. "
356,"Haha that‚Äôs true. But i started out in the company as their receptionist, also worked in billing before being moved to hr. 

They never once made me feel u comfortable. 

A couple of the guys heard one of our contractors saying lude things about me once, and his supervisor got an ear full, and he was let go of the job. 

I heard about it after the fact. I actually have a lot of respect and confidence in these guys. They can make some poor decision, but they‚Äôre good people "
357,"I'm saying there's times where making friends with a stranger is smiled upon and there's times where it is not. You do not know the difference. 

I feel like I'm talking to some kid or something, so peace out."
358,"Out of curiosity do you still talk/are you still friends?

I'm kind of in this situation right now and it breaks my heart because we are such good friends that I can't imagine life without him, but also shouldn't be fantasizing about kissing some random guy instead when I don't really want that with him."
359,Agreed! I‚Äôm a female engineer. One of maybe a dozen women in engineering at my company and the youngest. I have never been sexually harassed here. 
360,"If I see a sliver of hair on someone's clothing, my instinct is to pick it off them. I think I'm so compelled because I hate hair on my clothing, so it's like an all-out attack on all clothing hair. I've learned not to do that after the last person slowly side-stepped away from me with a slight look of fear in their eyes. It was a woman in the grocery store. She only kind of saw me take a long piece of hair off the shoulder of her coat as I was in line behind her, but she full-on saw me then inspect that hair because it was very long &amp; almost perfectly half blonde/half dark brown. That was the last time I've done it.. with the person's knowledge. "
361,The fact people believe that trope is concerning.
362,"Thanks, I appreciate it! To be honest, I've had a lifelong friend being my listener and I feel like I'm just in the zone of repeating myself again and again. It's just going to be that tug-of-war between not giving up and letting go."
363,"I am a guy on the other side of this right now. She was afraid to hurt me but would go cold on me sometimes because she didn't understand her feelings and why they weren't as strong. It sucks but I can accept that there is nothing inherently wrong with me. It took a lot of hurt to accept though. She just had long term doubts

I've been loved before so it can happen to me again :)"
364,The squeeze packet kraft is so much better
365,Dude if I walked in on the guy‚Äôs girlfriend and he was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breaking up with you for her‚Äù I‚Äôd beat his ass.

367,"&gt; hormonal supplements

Wait... That's a thing? ( for growing facial hair )"
368,"I was 18 working at Target. There was a cute boy working at Starbucks. I would stare all the time. He once called me out on it in a nice way and I just said there was nowhere else to look. It was the truth, but definitely made me realize how creepy I was.üò≥ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
369,"I‚Äôve known I want to be a mom for as long as I can remember. I also didn‚Äôt date at all in high school and barely in college. So starting in my late teens, I said (and fully believed at the time) that I would have kids on my own via sperm donor if I wasn‚Äôt married by 30. 

Well I‚Äôm now approaching 32 and nowhere near ready to raise a child on my own! Especially not with my family in another state. But my feelings on the matter have changed for other reasons. I‚Äôm no longer sure how I feel about intentionally bringing a child into the world who will never know anything significant about half his or her father. It just doesn‚Äôt seem fair. "
370,"If nothing else, I imagine it taught them to lock their doors so hopefully they're safe from worse events in the future."
371,"Honestly, it's not news that rich people buy their/their kid's way into prestigious colleges.

Lori Loughlin &amp; her husband seem to be the face of the scandal...and tbh, I actually feel a teensy bit bad for their kids. I'm sure they don't wanna freaking be there. They're rich. They can be influencers and still make stupid money."
372,"I actually am addicted to sugar and spent a lot of time in therapy.

Whenever I have to cut it out completely (at least once a year it will creep back in) I do a whole 30. I may not last 30 days but two weeks cuts the sugar addiction. The first week is nearly flu like and I could murder someone, but my whole family knows my struggle and they support me. When I did make it the whole 30 I lost a huge amount of weight and kept going down for months after. 

I have also taken medications to stop me from eating sugar. I am THAT bad that I have 3 different medical professionals helping me (therapist, primary care, psychiatrist) "
373,Same here. My favorite genre of play arguing is over things that could be solved with a two minute Wikipedia search. We both put forth our case and see who comes the closest. 
374,"Yeah, by accident. Back when Tumblr was popping (I was 21 in 2011), I had a HUGE crush on the guy who ran this semi-popular page (hip hop and art culture). He sent me some shirts he printed and I sent him pics of me wearing the shirts (no nudies). Never really talked on a personal level, just about art/music. He posted some highly edited artsy pics of himself but nothing really showing what he looked like. One day, he posted a bunch of DMs where he answered personal questions people asked him. Turns out he was a 15 yr old kid. I never spoke to him again or even interacted with him on Tumblr. I do still follow him on Instagram though. It‚Äôs creepy that I watched him grow up in this context but we never interacted again. "
375,[removed]
376,I feel like I could've written the first part of this. I cut contact pretty early but only after begging him to be with me because I thought we were going to be together forever. I definitely approach relationships differently now! 
377,Have you read Handmaid's Tale?
378,"Exactly. The fact that he did such a thing and she gladly stayed with him is mad shallow. I pray to God that I never turn into the type of person that feeds off people‚Äôs heart breaks like that. If he could do it to her, he‚Äôll do it to you. "
379,"I've never seen sexual harassment by co-workers in childcare, but some of the parents are certainly guilty of it. "
380,Hahaha that's awesome!
381,nick jonas
382,Red Dead has an excellent story! The game play is absolutely beautiful as well. I would highly recommend it
383,Isn't it already back though?

385," That's too bad. I used to deal with chronic migraines too, but it wasn't sleep-related. It's sad that we know too little about migraines to safely help people who get them."
386,"I wouldn't call that creepy, sounds more like hurt, sadness, and longing. Part of a grieving phase. It's not like you actually followed him on his dates, spied on him, or confronted him about it."
387,I feel this way when I join conversations I feel like I wasn‚Äôt invited to. Then people stare at me and I end up cringing at myself. :(
388,"Had a MAJOR crush on a guy I used to work with in high school. Looking back, cannot believe the things I did, I‚Äôm mortified by the way I acted. I‚Äôm surprised he never transferred stores or just quit. I had moved away and realized how just how creepy I was. I moved back and walked into a grocery store that he was working at (honestly had no idea he worked there or I would‚Äôve avoided it like the plague) and the look on his face when we made eye contact and watching him walk away in terror hoping I wouldn‚Äôt follow him or say hi, that‚Äôs a look I will never forget although I do deserve. Thinking about all those things I did makes me cringe."
389,"There's a Kurzgesagt world sticker on the lid, and a couple of Pusheen stickers on either side of the mouse pad."
390,"I like to do a moisturizing face mask, it's just a small thing I add to my routine cause it  makes my skin smoother and therefore my makeup look better. It also just feels really nice and gives a moment of relaxation before the big event."
391,"I haven't personally but my best friend Tinder matched with a guy who lived about 2.5 hours away so I played wingman and drove up with her to meet him. 

He is an amazingly good looking, friendly and charming guy and he was so nice that he had no problems that I tagged along on the date. He did an amazing job of engaging both of us while making it clear that she was the one he was interested in. After about an hour and after we were both comfortable with her being alone with him, I excused myself to our hotel and he dropped her off about 11 and I watched as he gave her a totally appropriate yet confident hug and kiss good night. 

They dated long distance for about a month then he moved to our city and they have basically been inseparable ever since and are getting married in June. "
392,"I work in digital marketing with little to no contact to the ""outside"" world when I am at work. It's honestly the best. "
393,Met my current SO in a bar on the night I celebrated my divorce from abusive ex.  New SO was the bartender and he's an amazing person.
394,Probably
395,Medium end retail. 
396,"All of them, in my opinion."
397,It saddens me that  you view that as an extremely progressive ideal and not the reality. 
398,Or somehow attached to a man. 
399,"Lately, not a lot.  Maybe five hours or so at most.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm okay, just a lot of changes recently to mull over alone in the dark."
400,"That getting married and having kids is *necessarily* the goal.

It's ok if that does happen to be your goal though. "
401,"I‚Äôm on good terms with my exs, just not friends with them like that. "
402,Although 75% of the blame is still on the person in a relationship.
403,"Bad breathe and knowing they spent all day sweating and didn‚Äôt shower before hand. 

I don‚Äôt mind getting dirty, I just don‚Äôt want to start that way unless we are on round two or something.

404,Human of the Year by Regina Spektor.  Love it. Love her!
405,My boobs are named Ronni Jo and Logan after my friends lol 
406,Stardew valley or Minecraft. Love the creativity 
407,If they take off the condom.
408,"Don't worry there are people out there who won't care ( like me!). So I hope that someday you find yourself with someone who makes you feel comfortable enough to share that with.

But the phrase ""natural medication"" makes me a little nervous. I'm not doubting your grandmother, but just in case her method doesn't work out, please see an actual doctor. In fact, it would be good if you asked a doctor first, but it's all up to you of course.

I'd also reccomend asking one directly about what the disease testing is like, just to get a second opinion."
409,Leave him. Focus on school. Don‚Äôt start smoking.
410,[removed]
411,It‚Äôs going to be ok. 
412,"Def did something similar. Except my friend and I had nicknames for our crushes, mind was ‚Äúbanana‚Äù so we thought we were talking in code but now I look back and I basically want to turn myself inside out I‚Äôm so embarrassed "
413,"OMG yes!!

So much squee"
414,"I don't. I know now that you either like 'em or you don't. ...but that doesn't mean you need to subject yourself to shitty people. I've never been one to make someone choose either. Sometimes, honey, you've just gotta ask yourself why your wonderful SO would be friends with garbage? In my experience either your person will realize they're not great and they distance themselves from toxic folks or your relationship will eventually do the more intimate equivalent.  ...and in that case you'll realize you're not meant for people like them or their friends. "
415,"Your digestive issues aren‚Äôt normal. Find a doctor who will listen and help you thrive. 

Most importantly keep up your studies, go to college and your plan to get out of your hometown. "
416,Oh my god this. When I was in like 5th grade I looked in my cute neighbors room with binoculars. I look back and I‚Äôm still grossed out many years later. I didn‚Äôt even see anything but STILL.
417, About 7. I'm better on 8-9 but I work 2 jobs so it's not easy to get to bed as early as I'd like.
418,Usually eight but it‚Äôs been more around 6 hours lately and I can‚Äôt fall asleep until like 3 am or something like that. 
419,"Girl, that's not a lot at all! Don't worry! 

Relationships go through phases too, especially if you're younger &amp; both people are still changing &amp; maturing.

We used to have a major fight about once a month - that was definitely a lot. They were actual fights too, crying, yelling, etc. That was during probably year 2-3.5 of the relationship. 

Now it's been almost 5 years &amp; we have a serious disagreement maybe once every few months. "
420,"He has a friend that downright has talked to me like I'm stupid before and has gone out of his way to talk to me and treat me some sort of way. This friend also has a girlfriend of many years and makes all sorts of comments in front of myself and my boyfriend about other girls and pretty much oggling them and saying all sorts of raunchy shit about other girls while being in a relationship and I feel like that kind of sets up an example of relationships for my boyfriend. His other friend I don't like all that much is just a single dude bro who is constantly talking about other girls in incredibly demeaning ways calling girls ""dumb bitches"", ""dumb sluts"", etc.. and I am kind of repulsed that these are people my boyfriend hangs out with on the regular."
421,"Yes I have. It was only a couple of hours away but I was also only 17 lol. We had met online in one of those aol chat rooms (ahh memories). And we talked on the phone for about 5 months before I drove down there. He was almost 20 at the time (but I‚Äôve always liked them older, so it‚Äôs really no surprise). It was so exciting and fun. One of my friends called me every couple of hours to make sure I was still alive lmao. We did have sex that first night and continued dating for about a year or so after. We eventually broke up but if I had to do it all over again I‚Äôm pretty sure I would do it all the same. "
422,r/2meirl4meirl

425,"Depends on the context.  I don‚Äôt typically get mistaken for a teen anymore (I‚Äôm late 30s), but people still regularly assume that I‚Äôm in my early twenties.

Usually it‚Äôs intended as a compliment so that‚Äôs the way I take it.  If it‚Äôs a random person that I‚Äôll never see again, I just thank them and go on with my day.
