0,"For years when my boyfriend (then eventually fiancé) paid for our meal with a card and we would get back two receipts, one to sign and one to keep, I always signed the one we kept with my first name and his last name as a playful little joke. 

He died in a car accident and when I had to get his things out of his car I found out that he kept every one of those receipts with my name on them"
1,"From my own experience:

Sex with women is much less formulaic than with men. Men seem to have an itinerary that's been heavily influenced by porn in their heads, and deviating from the ""foreplay --&gt; oral --&gt; PIV until man orgasms --&gt; sleep"" formula sometimes confuses them.

Men are more likely to stereotype me as a threesome-crazy nympho who will do whatever they want in the bedroom. Women are more likely to stereotype me as being five seconds away from cheating on them.

Women are better at giving thoughtful gifts that clearly were tailored for me and my personality, instead of ""I got you flowers because women like flowers and you're a woman.""

Men are more likely to be value themselves over the relationship. This is a double-edged sword, and not always a negative - there are less arguments that end in ""Well, I was secretly upset about something you did or said the other day but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to upset you but I've been mad ever since then.""

Women are more likely to give emotional labour and support. Men are happy to take it, and will often actually make you the *sole* provider of emotional support in their lives, but when it's time to get some support back they don't know what to do and seem irritated you even asked.

Men are more confident you mean what you say when you say you like them or you enjoy being with them or you want to date them. You can be dating a woman for six months and she'll still wonder if you *like* like her."
2,Why the hell is everyone always meeting up at a single diner/coffee shop/booth at random times and apparently unplanned?  Do they ever have times when they just come in and sit there and no one shows up so they leave after a while?
3,When I'm struggling with an athletic activity and someone says anything even vaguely encouraging.
4,sweaty crotch.  we have the added sweaty underboob.
5,No one ever repeats outfits. They just have endless wardrobes!
6,"He was standing behind me in a long line at Barnes and Noble with his friend. His friend was scrolling on his phone, but he had been making small talk with me specifically. He seemed really, really nice. Finally he asked me to show him all of the titles of books I had in my hand. I was like “oh, sure haha” and then he went “thanks, be right back.”

He came back to his place in line beside his friend and he was holding one of the books that I had. I gave him a “huh?” look and he said “I read the first 3 you have and loved them, so I took the one I didn’t have as a solid recommendation.”

We both ended up checking out at the same time with different cashiers and when we walked outside together he said “I would really like to get to know you. Can I take you out to dinner?”

I told him that I really appreciated it, that I found him very charming, and that he came across as really genuine... but that I had a boyfriend I loved very much. He thanked me for my graciousness, I thanked him for his, it was all smiles, and we went our separate ways. 

I thought it was more charming than “smooth” but it’s one that sticks out to me."
7,"In high school the boy I liked offered to drive me home from a friends house one night, even though I was totally out of his way. Halfway there he pulled over saying he thought he had a flat tire and he was gonna check it. I offered to get out and help him but he insisted I stay in the car. A minute later he came back with a bouquet of flowers he had in the trunk and asked me to be his girlfriend. Of course I said yes."
8,"""I'm a struggling writer- look at my spacious urban apartment!"""
9,"I took a self defense class and my husband (then a Marine) taught me a few things. I was able to fight off an attempted rape successfully. It was awful. I was in the hospital, missed a couple of weeks of work, some injuries took months to heal and I still have a messed up toe. Still, I fought the guy off and am fine. Girls should learn self defense and know they can defend themselves."
10,"I'm a bartender, one of my regulars left her husband and father of her kids to be with his father, got pregnant by the father, then went back to the son and had another baby. It was quite messy and awkward."
11,"Honestly, I watch documentaries about space and the universe. When I remind myself of the grand scale of the universe and how insignificant we all truly are, I stop worrying about what my sister thinks about that one thing I said at Thanksgiving."
12,Slow. Walkers. And people who just stop in the middle of the hallway/sidewalk/aisle. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY. I live in NYC and if you're going to walk like that DO NOT WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING.
13,"This was when I was much younger, but I had this birthday party where we started playing telephone. The boy I liked got really excited at one point saying ""oh I have one to send down the line!"" And I was at the end of the line. He asked me out by sending a message down the line and in my little 13-year-old mind I thought it was the slickest move ever"
14,"Yup. We met on tinder, spent a few weeks messaging, and met up at a concert then his house. Both had a great time but we didn’t talk for about a year afterwards. We were both in huge transitional periods and needed to get through that(unspoken understanding). 

Eventually he found me on Facebook and we met at a bar. We’ve been inseparable ever since and are now married with a kid."
15,"A few things that haven’t been mentioned yet: 

Don’t wear your nail polished chipped, it’s better to wear none at all. 

Invest in a lint roller and use it. Animal hair is a no go. 

If you have a minor defect in your wardrobe, fix it. A hanging piece of thread or missing button is definitely noticeable.

Clean your shoes. White sole shoes that are no longer white or scuffs from driving make you look unpolished."
16,"I am always amazed in the professional world by the number of men who think that their professional clothes cost exponentially more than women's.  I understand that a good tailored suit costs $500, but if you have to wear a suit to your office, so do the women (or an equivalent suiting dress) and that shit ain't cheap.  On top of that, even if the office requires a suit most days, the men can get away with owning 4, while the women are expected to have much more variety in their wardrobe."
17,"Except in animation, where they have a single outfit to last them however long the show runs."
18,"Everyone should know how to physically defend themselves, unfortunately it’s still needed."
19,"This may be a personal experience rather than one that applies generally to bisexual women, but I do feel less self-conscious about my body with women than I do with men in the early days of a relationship.

There are so many expectations on women these days to look a certain way and to be constantly well groomed. I've dated more than one man who doesn't truly understand how unrealistic these expectations are and how truly impossible it is for women to consistently meet them and have a full life as well. I'm not necessarily saying they're judging it or being negative about it, but they don't get it. The perfect example of this is the ""Hur hur, women take hours to get ready, amirite"" way of thinking. Of course men in general take less time to get ready - they can shower and go. If they decide not to bother shaving, most of the time that's an option to them - all of our grooming routines tend to feel mandatory and there's an emotional price to forgoing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Women, on the other hand, have an immediate understanding of the situation because they live in society as women as well. That shared experience means that I feel more comfortable to be imperfect around them earlier."
20,"When someone reacts to something out loud that they see on their phone, in order to have you ASK them what they’re reacting to, as opposed to just...telling you"
21,Literally everybody in The Vampire Diaries uses Bing. That's way too many people using Bing.
22,"Oh lord, sweaty crotch during a period. God help me."
23,"The worse I feel, the less I do. Instead of browsing Reddit to kill time (like now!) I will stay glued to my phone for hours. I’ll keep reading in the loo, I’ll keep scrolling while I feed my pets, I’ll keep flicking through pictures while I change and get into bed. If I can keep my brain busy with something else it means I don’t have to think at all about whatever’s bothering me."
24,People who enter the elevator before allowing others to exit the elevator.
25,"I see stuff has already been mentioned (being rejected, judged on appearance etc)  
For me - I've come across guys thinking bullying is a guy problem  
As someone who was slapped, spit on, had stuff stolen, bullied into writing assignments for others, and shit-talked behind my back as a 11-15yo girl... yeah, no."
26,"A friend of mine is now engaged. Her partner’s last name is French, hers is Butts. Someone asked them if they were going to hyphenate - Jennifer French-Butts."
27,Oh god all the ways this could backfire.
28,"My friend is married to a man twelve years her junior. Her MIL hated her so bad when they were dating, since my friend had two sons from previous relationships as well as two adopted daughters. Like the MIL, who I promise is mostly a decent person, once threw a basket of cucumbers at my friend. Very hateful. She wanted my friend to leave her son alone so he could meet a younger woman without kids.

....

Then the man in question’s 17 year old brother impregnated two women at the same time. One was a 16 year old girl; one was my friend’s 45 year old sister. Both women had their babies, and the MIL decided my friend was actually OK after all."
29,Women are softer
30,The flirting method my now boyfriend used on me was pretty affective on our first date. I talk a lot with my hands and he would high five or shake my hand if he had the opportunity and it made me laugh. Eventually he just grabbed it and held it.
31,"I think the two main issues are that A) men tend to see their own orgasm as the big finale and B) men often seem to have this mental block about certain acts coming before or after certain other acts. So PIV can follow oral, but oral after PIV is bizarre unless it's a quick momentary intermission before returning to PIV. It's kind of as if they see sexual acts as some sort of numbered scale with 1 being making out and vaginal/anal penetration being 10, so while they can get their heads around ""1, 4, 6, 10"", the idea of going ""1, 6, 10, 1, 5"" is totally foreign and just doesn't occur to them at all. Obviously there are exceptions.

I think the best way around it is to stop seeing penetration as the big finale, and to be open to continuing sex after his own orgasm. Obviously he may need to take a short break immediately after, I realise that both physical and mental refractory periods are a real thing. However I can't stress how refreshing it is to have sex with someone knowing that I'm not on some sort of deadline to come before they do, because the moment they come the sex *must* end."
32,"The houses.

I'm not talking about the *blatantly* unrealistic NYC apartments that everybody makes fun of, but the rather the regular suburban sitcom houses that are sort of almost realistic on the surface, but that when taken in aggregate, become absurd. 

Why is every house two stories?  Do ranch houses not exist unless you're poor?  Conversely, do regular-ish middle class people *never* buy gaudy McMansions that they happened to get a good deal on?  Why is every room of every house perfectly decorated? Why are houses never messy (unless it's a gag specifically *about* things being messy)? Why are there never any sad, half-decorated rooms that nobody quite knows what to do with?  

I live in the suburbs.  I know what our housing stock is like.  And trust me, almost all of us have weird rooms that we don't know how to to decorate, and pieces of furniture that look like shit, but that we just can't justify the expense of replacing. I JUST WANT MY SITCOM CHARACTERS TO SHARE THE PAIN OF HALF-FINISHED DINING ROOMS, AND A SOFA FROM 2001 THAT KIND OF SMELLS LIKE FEET AND HAS AN OBVIOUS ASS IMPRINT, DAMNIT. IS THAT REALLY TOO MUCH TO ASK?!?!"
33,"50 year old men regularly date women in their 20's, but everyone acts like they're the same age."
34,"the breakfast scenes!!!! why is there always a full spread of every imaginable breakfast food, yet everyone grabs an apple and says some shit like “haha gotta go! in a rush!” WTF"
35,I worked in my school library part time in high school. New kid came to the front desk and we were chatting. He slid me his number on an index card and said he was hoping to check me out.
36,For me: Shoes in the house in general. I once made the *controversial* choice to take off my shoes when entering an American friend’s home. Her mom was all “You can always spot the Canadian! Bawhahahahah.”  WHY ARE WE MOCKED FOR UPHOLDING SUCH A BASIC LEVEL OF HYGIENE??
37,"Friends did a great bit, on this exact thing.

They all walk in, all normal, happy. See their spot is taken, they're like ??? Well what do we do now."
38,"Well, he has a family to support.   What the hell do you think I'm working my ass off for? The number of times I've heard it rationalized why men make more than women because they have a family to support.  All while looking me in the eye knowing that I'm a single mother supporting two kids on my own. Yeah, I'm apparently working here as a hobby."
39,"I like touching. Something simple like a hand on my back or around my shoulder if we’re walking or even something stupid like asking to play thumb war like really any kind of little touch I like. Also cool with jokes that are sexual in nature. Nothing too crazy or try hard but if it flows naturally in the conversation I wouldn’t be freaked out by it. The key is being subtle and letting everything happen naturally not trying to force it, then it just comes off creepy."
40,And that the favourite table/ booth/ area is always available.
41,"I texted him “what are ya doing tomorrow?” So I could follow up with making plans but he beat me to it by responding “going out with you” 

We ended up buying sandwiches and juice and going hiking"
42,"* Being rejected, or told, ""I like you *as a friend*"" when asking someone out on a date.

* Being judged on appearance. (Probably moreso.)

* Being called ""odd,"" ""weird,"" or ""creepy,"" when social interactions go awry. (We all make mistakes, and some of us are assholes, too.)

* The question of whether or not to even bother asking someone out who is ""out of your league.""

* Asking someone out, or planning to, only to find out that they're already in a relationship. 

* Being laughed at for being too short/too tall/too thin/too fat/having a big nose/etc."
43,shoes on the bed.
44,"""This sounds like something that you could tell your therapist. I'm not qualified to be one so I can't help you.""

45,"phone sounds when typing. like what is the point of all that noise? 

also when tv's are not all the way off and make a high pitched noise. i can ALWAYS here it."
46,"Someone I am related to was the best man at his best friend's wedding. At the wedding my relative and the wife met each other for the first time became infatuated with each other. She proceeded to have two kids with the husband, but it turned out that she started cheating on the husband with my relative and that one of the kids was his instead of the husband's. The husband's parents also bought a house for the two of them as a wedding present.

She pretended the child was the husband's though while still sleeping with my relative. In the end though, the affair was exposed, but the husband didn't want to force the children out of their home so let the wife still live in the house with the kids. My relative then very quickly moved into the house with the wife and children and ended up marrying her. I found out a few months ago that the wife and my relative haven't paid any rent or paid for any bills in the whole time they have lived in this house.

I normally don't answer questions here since I am male, but I did this time since I thought it was very fitting."
47,"Yesterday I went to do dishes and my roommate was crying on the phone to one of her friends in her bedroom that’s right off the kitchen. Her boyfriend that she’s been with for over a year got an STD (which is gossipy enough) and then she had to get tested, but when she went to the clinic they somehow got her info and her mom’s info mixed up and they called her mom to tell her she had the STD. Now her mom, who is super religious, is pissed and she might be breaking up with her boyfriend over the STD. Today they were fighting in the living room and her bf tried to turn it on her saying they got together too fast but I had to leave the apartment before I could hear more."
48,People making plans on the phone without times or addresses
49,"Some one once came up to me at a bookstore and said “I’m sorry but this journal told me I have to ask you out right now” . The journal on the shelf said “Carpe diem” on the cover. 

Very smooth, but I was shopping for my boyfriend."
50,"My colleague, whose last name is Suckle, was getting married. He mentioned that his fiancée wanted to hyphenate her last name after they wed, but it just wasn’t an option. When I asked why, he explained that her maiden name was Seaman."
51,"My grandad gave this advice:
Will it matter in a day, a month, or a year?

If the answer is yes to all three, you can assume it's a pretty serious problem. But if the answer is no to just one, then there's no reason to worry about it."
52,"One of the most uncomfortable days of my life was working outside, in polyester-blend uniform pants with a too-tight waist while I was both cramping and bleeding. It was about 90 degrees with 500% humidity, and I was serving birthday cake to a hundred screaming children. 

If it had been possible to remove my uterus myself I would have done so that day."
53,"I was always under the impression that a part of the game was that women wanted to trap men into marriages and lock them in with babies, then turn the sex-tap off as they mysteriously lost their attractiveness and libido.

Then I joined r/Childfree and found that most of it's members were women who don't wan't children. Turns out having kids is far far worse for women than men: for their bodies, mental health, financial security, lives in general. As a result, being rational agents, many women decide it's not in their interests and they would rather stay free.

Then I joined r/Deadbedrooms and found that most of it's members were sexually-frustrated women whose husbands were addicted to games, porn and masturbation.

I still get the vibe there's slightly more positive feeling about monogamy in general with women than men: even in r/Childfree they're pretty positive about marriage and stuff - lifelong monogamy has always terrified me and I think commitment-phobia is something men struggle with more than women.

In any case, in both of these forums there are far more women than men: this genuinely surprised me and changed my perspective a lot. Avoiding children, avoiding the decline of passion in long-term relationships.

\[Shit, I thought this was r/Askmen and typed this response, fuck-it\]"
54,Malcolm in the Middle is good for this reason! It actually looks like a middle class/lower middle class house and family.
55,My cousin (25f) found inappropriate texts between her husband and her sister. The sister (18f) was sending him provocative pics and texts. He would right back saying how much he missed her and stuff. Like it was obvious they was some sexual things going on between them.
56,"A traditional sense of duty and responsibility, such as providing a safe home for your children or having to be the one to fix the leaky faucet, etc. I've noticed that many men assume that a woman's first reaction would be to ask for help or expect a man to take care of it for them. However,  for myself and a whole lot of other ladies, our first thought is ""Crap, I've gotta take care of that asap!"" 

NEWSFLASH: We like taking care of our own business!"
57,😥 hope you’re doing okay x
58,"Me and my 6y boyfriend have the same last name, so you could say I practiced for this relationship my whole life :)"
59,Itchy crotch. We have to itch and adjust ourselves too
60,Hello brother/uncle. That's so wild. Specially that she went back to the son. Like I could not take my husband back if he had a kid with my mom. WTF.
61,"No. But someone reached out to me for a second chance after ghosting me, and I was naive enough to take him back. He ended up ghosting me again after almost a year. So, not recommended."
62,Being an unwilling virgin with autism in your twenties. It’s funny how perfectly I fit the “incel” stereotype when I was younger.
63,I used to stick my face in my ex girlfriends ass and just keep it there because she was so soft. 0/10 not the same with my husband.
64,"The first thing I thought of when I read the thread title was Spongebob and Squidward's relatively large two-story houses that they purchased on a fry cook's and fast food cashier's wages, respectively."
65,"A friend decided to open his relationship, to which his first and only gf of 5 years very reluctantly agreed out of fear of losing him, so long as she didn't hear about it. Another person from our friend group and a good friend of hers very enthusiastically volunteered to sleep with him, and made a point of flaunting it. This culminated in the sex-friend being extremely possessive of the guy and being nasty to his gf. They eventually broke off the arrangement.

The other girl had previously tried to get into the pants of two guys in our circle while they were in relationships with mutual friends. She later did they same thing with my own boyfriend, which is how I found out about all the other stuff.

The worst part? Now everyone in our group knows, and they pretend nothing ever happened. She's still a major player in the group."
66,"When a character is texting someone close to them and it shows their phone so you can SEE the text and they have no previous texts?!

Jenny this is your best friend since 5th grade, how is this the first time you're texting her?"
67,"I hate the sound of sloppy eating, like slurping or crunching on chips or nuts or whatever :("
68,I think young children should be taught a hierarchy of conflict resolution strategies.  I'm not a huge fan of teaching children to escalate conflicts into violence simply because children are not always good judges of what is going on in a situation.
69,"Early in dating, I always ask what kind of lingerie my new partner likes to see. Every man I've dated has had an immediate answer, whether it's lacy or silky, boyshorts or thongs, corsets, whatever. Every woman I've dated has said ""whatever makes you feel the most sexy and confident"". 

Both answers have their positives and negatives lol. The former gives me clear direction, but the latter always ends up in a deeper getting-to-know-you discussion."
70,no but i have an instagram reserved with that name for whenever that day comes 🙃

73,Undersea real estate is pretty affordable- you just need a few clams.
74,"lots of men will say ''yes'' to being asked out not because they like you, but because they interpret it as ''free sex, y/n''

a woman generally will not say yes unless she likes women and likes you, so it's a bit safer to get your hopes up/ego boosted lol"
75,"I usually start crying, tbh. Sometimes ends in a panic attack. If I'm with people, which I often am during these times, then I try to get as quiet as possible, one, because I'm trying not to cry and two, so people don't know what's happening. 

Then, once I'm alone I usually let it all out, and I isolate myself for a day or two. Nothing too bad. I'm trying to get better and not breaking down at all."
76,"When my husband was in the navy, we met this other couple.  The guy was also in the navy, and his wife was like me, a dependent.  We became friends with them.  I will call them Cory &amp; Rose.  Cory was cool, but Rose was always so rude to me, at first.  She never liked me in the beginning.  No matter how hard I tried being friends with her.  

Anyways, about two years after meeting them, my husband and Cory left the navy around the same time.  Cory &amp; Rose went on to have a son and moved back to to the Cory’s home state, which happened to be my husband and my home state, as well.  So it was easy to stay in touch with them.  Over the years after we moved back home, Rose started softening up to me a bit and then we became sort of like acquaintances.  

Long story short, Cory started treating her like shit and eventually cheated on her and left her for his high-school sweet heart.  A lot of stuff happened, and since Rose (now ex-wife) couldn’t afford to be raise their son having full custody, she willingly gave Cory full custody.

It was a huge mess at first and I felt terribly for Rose.  But over time it seemed like Cory’s new wife and Rose were getting along for the son’s sake.  So that was good.  

A couple of weekends ago, Cory comes to my husband and my house to spend the weekend with us.  Mainly for my husband and him to catch up and talk about his new business he’s trying to get my husband involved in.  

He starts telling us all this shit about Rose.  How she’s this shitty mom and how she does drugs.  How she hasn’t seen their son since he was 8 months old ( their son is 6 now).  He tells us how she moved back to her home state, clear across the country to avoid child support.  He even told us that she was such an unfit mom when they were still together.  I mean all kinds of bad shit about her.  He was running her name through the dirt.  

The thing is, I know he’s lying through his teeth about a lot of things because I am still friends with Rose on Facebook and I follow her on Snapchat.  She posts all the time about their son.  She gets him on weekends, and holidays.  She flies from her home state on a regular basis to visit him.  All of this I know because she posts proof.  A lot of pictures and videos of spending time with him.  She is friends with the new wife and they tag each other on Facebook and will post pictures back and forth about getting together with the son.  They also didn’t split up until their son was two years old because I remember visiting with Rose around that time frame at her in-laws house.  She was in the process of potty training their son during that time.  So she actually gave up custody when their son was two, not 8 months.  

I feel bad for her.  She does not seem like a bad mother at all, and I think it’s sad that he lies to everyone about that.  It also makes me wonder what else he lies about.  

He even slut shamed her when he was at her house, saying how bad of a mom she is because she sleeps around.  Whether it’s true or not, who gives a crap, it doesn’t affect how she parents, imo.  It’s not like her so is around those men."
77,Waking up with perfectly intact makeup. What kind of witchcraft is that?
78,Touch. My. Lower. Back. And. Waist.
79,"People wake up and eat breakfast when the sun is already out and high in the sky. Like they wake up at 10 AM to go to work or school. I don't know what kind of lives these people lead, but if it's M-F, we're doing the morning routine in the dark."

81,"He threw a ballon at me and said ""hey."""
82,"I WISH I had thought to practice... It was important to him that I take his name, but where I come from, it is more common for women keep their names. I compromised, and just added his name onto mine (not hyphenated). The only way someone can now correctly say my full name is if they are fluently bilingual- otherwise it sounds like you're wheezing loudly around a mouthful of rocks. 

But... His is one of those English names that seems to have just gathered up all the consonants roaming nearby and stuck them together. 10 years later, and I still write it like a 5yr old."
83,This is the cutest sentiment. Just made me cry from reading this. Hope you are doing ok. Really sorry to hear that he passed away.
84,"Many 80s/90s sitcoms  had two staircases in the home, one in the kitchen and one in the living area (Family Matters, The Nanny, Full House, Boy Meets World, Step by Step, The Cosby Show, Sister Sister). Never seen a house designed like this in real life."
85,"I was sat with friends in a Chinese restaurant in Manchester many years ago, when this truly stunning looking guy caught my eye. I smiled, as you do, and it was returned but his table left shortly after. Anyway I didn’t think anything of it particularly, and had a lovely meal with lots of laughter. Couple of hours passed and we were about to leave, when he walked back in and straight up to me. He said that he couldn’t stopped thinking about my smile, asked if could take me out for dinner sometime. I nearly fell over but of course said yes! We enjoyed a few months of dinners and fun times before it naturally fizzled out. Always stuck in my mind!"

88,"This is something that happens often on TV that always bothers me. Two characters will be having an argument, or a disagreement, or one just discovered something unsettling about the other, whatever. This happens in one location. Then the show cuts to them in another location, having just traveled there, generally by car or whatever. The scene starts in the new location, THEN they start their conversation/argument/whatever. So the implication is, they just shared a long car ride and didn't talk about the subject at hand at all??"
89,That’s a lawsuit right there.  HIPAA violation.
90,"And then the shovel has ""I really dig you!"" written on the handle. Very sweet!"
91,"This happened a few months ago, I went to a restaurant with my mom and our waiter was so cute. He kept eyeing me the entire night and would shyly look away when I caught him. By the end of our meal, I told my mom I was going to leave him my number. She was shocked as that was definitely not me (I’m really shy and keep to myself). I was feeling rather confident. My heart was racing as I scribbled my name and number on a paper and left it in the check. We bolted out of there, but not before I made eye contact one more time and he smiled and waved. 

A few minutes later, I get a text. And it was a photo of the note I left and a note with his phone number on it. He was going to give me his number but was too shy/couldn’t figure out how to. I was screaminggggg. It felt like a rom com moment. 

Unfortunately he ghosted me after two dates lol. But I’ll never forget this!"

93,Being able to express our emotions willy nilly with no judgment. I think we are judged just as hard to for being emotional and it’s always used to undermine our work and decisions.

98,"The family in Fresh Off the Boat wears shoes in their house, and it bothers me as an Asian American."
99,"No kidding! Girl bullying is insidious and hidden. From the outside, no one could tell it was happening to me in 5th grade. And TBH, I thought no one would ever believe it until I read Cat's Eye, by Margaret Atwood, as a teen and I was like, ""OH GOD YES THIS!"" I now have a 3rd grade daughter and I watch that shit like a hawk."
100,"When I met my husband, we were both working on cruise ships as performers.  He’s a pianist and I’m a singer, and he casually told me as we passed each other on deck that we should jam sometime.  Now I’m a pianist as well, but I’m not a great improver, and I was immediately mortified that I would embarrass myself.  So I laughed and said that I wasn’t really into jamming.  Turns out he had used that line because it had worked for one of the bassists on board, so he figured he’d try it on me.  Didn’t work, married anyways."
101,I’ve survived 100% of my worst days so far.
102,"I wish I could say she left his ass. But no. They have 3 kids and shes a stay at home mom. She confronted the two of them and they apologized and they swore it was never physical. I call bullshit. But she didnt tell her parents and has kept it pretty quiet because shes ashamed. I feel bad for her. The other part that makes me mad is that the husband has been with my cousin since the little sister was 12. You'd think he would have seen her as his own little sister or something. 

Genuinely seemed like a good, honest family man though. He has everyone fooled."
103,"Ever since coming to terms with my sexuality, it's started to really bother me how men see their orgasm as the end to sex. Most of my previous male partners didn't even try to pretend like they cared about my pleasure, most didn't even bother to  attempt to help me orgasm. But when I try to help myself they get mad."
104,Paying an ATM money to get access to *my own money*
105,"I love that scene in The Marvelous Mrs Maisel when she pretends to fall asleep with her husband then gets up again to do her evening routine. Then in the morning, she wakes up early to put makeup on and do her hair, then goes back to bed. So her husband never sees her ""undone""."
106,But what if it got distorted to something completely different? Such a gamble
107,I’m gay so that’s been an interesting conversation. We’ve gone from “Nobody has to change their name” to “Okay maybe just me” (I’m a teacher and my maiden name is Eastern European and difficult for students. Hers is a bit more common) to “Fuck it let’s both hyphenate.” We love each other and we want our marriage to feel balanced in all ways. Plus it’s a fun play on the Bride-takes-a-new-name-tradition since we’re a couple of brides!
108,"Additionally, when they’re done making these plans, no one says bye. They just hang up."
109,"practice closed body language, and tell yourself as many times as you need to that you don't *owe* strangers emotional caretaking.

when somebody starts in with you, ask yourself ''is this amount of disclosure/the amount of emotional labour expected of me appropriate for our relationship?''. if the answer is no, think about times in your life when you've overshared, and how people communicated their discomfort. maybe their expression fell, they crossed their arms or leaned away, maybe their eyes darted to the exits before they said something non-committal like ''that sucks''. that's how a normal person reacts to an emotional boundary being crossed. 

we're just told that because we're women/abused children, it's our job to manage people's emotions, so we don't learn that we have a right to boundaries or feel like b-words for having them."

112,Bust out that magic eraser for the soles.
113,"Speaking strictly from personal experience:



Women are less likely to pester me about threesomes with exes. Men tend to think that bisexual women are all into group sex. It has started more than one fight with more than one entitled white dude.


Men smell better and I prefer snuggling them over women.


Men get more attached after sex than women do.

Women understand consent more easily than most men.

Creep won't leave you alone in public? Women are more likely to step in. Men are more likely to sit back and blame you for someone else's behavior.


Women are more likely to stay quiet about things that bother or upset them. I blame this on the way girls are taught that their emotional needs are less important.


Men seem to enjoy cooking more...? Or maybe I just get lucky and have an unidentified skill for attracting good cooks. 


Women are a little less organized. But I'm also kind of an asshole about organization in the home, so I may be biased. 


Men tend to cheat more. 


Men's body temperatures are higher. This means cuddle positions do change slightly with different genders, to maximize the comfort of both parties. 


Men are less likely to get dirty dishes to the sink. 


Women seem to have longer attention spans. 


It is easier to hit the pause button on an argument with a man and revisit it after a time out. I appreciate that women I date usually want to finish the entire discussion in one go, but it's hard to reach a conclusion when you're both emotionally and mentally exhausted. 


Women floss their teeth more."
114,Because of the implication.
115,"Imagine being a woman growing up with the name Seaman, thinking well at least if I get married I’ll get a less annoying name! And then you fall in love with a dude named Suckle..."

118,When two people are having a conversation in the car and the person driving is looking at the other person instead of the road for a ridiculously long amount of time. In real life they definitely would’ve steered off the road by then
119,"The ones that think this are the ones that only really see women they're attracted to. Other women are in the background or don't ""count"" to them. These are the ones saying every woman on the planet can go to a bar and get laid - they literally think all women can do that. This means they ignore all women who can't and don't consider them real women in their warped worldview.

  


The incel community is a scary place."
120,"A girl that I was friends with in high school was having a long time sexual affair with her sister’s husband. She was 15, he was in his 30’s, but it had started years earlier. She babysat their kids all the time (her nieces &amp; nephews) and he would come home and they’d go into the bedroom and have sex. He would text and call her all day long while we were at school. I remember thinking it was really gross and weird but I don’t think I realized just how fucked up the whole situation was until I was older."

122,I'm kind of baffled how anyone could think that women don't get judged on appearance or laughed at for being too fat.
123,"Having to live up to the stereotype of society, and unfulfilled sex drive"
124,Also when someone asks another character out in a date and they’re like “great I’ll see you tonight” without discussing a time or place or anything!! HOW DO THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO DO SO?!
125,"I’ve found that it’s easier for me to identify with women and connect through experiences than with men. I’ve also found that I enjoy sex better with women than men because there’s more thought put into it than “let’s get that nut!!”  On the other hand, I find it a lot harder to flirt with women or tell if they’re interested in me than men. I lean 80:20 towards women both romantically and sexually"
126,Kim Possible is the only show I remember not doing this haha. Only the villains had one outfit.
127,"I used to work on a cruise ship, and I had a several Mediterranean circuits I frequented.  Out of probably 50 different cities I went to, Lisbon was probably my favorite.  Such a vibrant city with so much to do and see.  I only got to stop there twice because it was on my transatlantic itinerary, which I thankfully only had two times during my contract.  But both times were pretty magical."

132,"Sex with men is always foreplay&gt;sex&gt;finish. Always. Like I've never met a man who deviates from that. Sex with women tends to last longer, be more touchy and generally better from you own experience.  


I will say its way easier to find a date with a man than with a woman. I can tell when a man is interested in me but am clueless when it comes to women. Also I've heard some other bi/pan folks say this but men are simpler to date in general than women are. But I feel that's because there's a huge amount of hetronomative bs and thought processes you gotta wade through."
133,"Just from my experience as a bi woman who is not interested in monogamy or children:

When I tell women the above information, they tend to believe me and respect that I don't want those things. If they aren't interested in me for those reasons, cool.

When I tell men the above information, they seem to believe that I will change my mind at some point. Often, they will pretend to be on board with my choices initially, but will constantly question me about whether I'm sure about it. Often I will learn that they actually do want monogamy and/or children, but decided to see me anyway with the hope that I will change my mind. I'm not sure if this is because they think that women will all eventually want monogamy and/or children, or if they think that they're such a prize that no woman could resist committing to them. Either way, it's annoying."
134,"Thank you! Women are *expected* to be more emotional, but we aren't *respected* for it. ""Women are more emotional than men"" doesn't mean ""women suffer no negative consequences for being emotional,"" it means ""women can and will be dismissed for their manipulative, irrational womanly emotions, whether they're actually being emotional at this exact moment or not."""
135,"A lot of things related to dating.  It seems like a lot of men think if you are a woman, especially if you are an attractive woman, you don't experience any of the negatives that come along with dating and don't understand what they go through in that arena.

We experience unrequited interest, get turned down, ghosted, get cheated on, get fallen out of love with, go through dry periods, get used, etc just like they do sometimes.  People being shitty knows no gender."

150,"People talking on their phones on public transit. Obviously, they're well within their right to do so. But for me, bus time is quiet time, and listening to a one-sided conversation for 40 minutes drives me crazy, especially if they're so loud I can hear them through my headphones."
151,Well for starters he could have gone to the trunk of his car and grabbed his shovel
152,"Awe that's cute! My friend worked in the library work study program in college. This guy who had a huge crush on her found a book, misplaced it, then asked her for assistance. He was too shy to ask her out then but fast forward to the next year I dragged her to a party with me. He was visiting (he had graduated by then) and saw her and got all excited and started chatting her up. He asked her out by the end of the night, and fast forward many many years, they are happily married and have 3 kids! :-)"
153,A girl I used to work with was pregnant with our old managers baby. I got to see everything unfold from them secretly dating while they worked together to openly dating after she quit and then engaged and pregnant.
154,"Carry yourself with pride.

Don't look down at the floor when walking (unless you have too, like stairs.  No one wants to faceplant down the stairs), clean and fitted clothes, brushed hair, and clean or make up face (you don't need make-up to look professional)."
155,"Sex scenes. The ""passionate, first time w new person"" sex. Theres like never tht awkward 20 seconds of getting condom, opening condom, putting on condom."
156,"Everyone should know how to physically defend themselves. I have always known how to throw a punch and am certainly not afraid to defend myself if needed. Someone puts his hands on me, he will regret it.

Depends how young a girl we're talking about. If it's a kid and they're in school, punching someone in the face or kicking them in the balls is not the best first response. Tell a teacher. If what the boy is doing is meant to be sexually threatening and there's no one around to help, then by all means, punch him or kick him."

159,"Far too many men think that foreplay is a minor detail, that sex revolves around PIV, and that sex ends when they orgasm. 

Frankly, that type of sex sucks. Most women can't orgasm from PIV alone, and a timeline of having to finish before him or you don't finish at all is stressful. 

Men who are actually good in bed will focus on their partner's pleasure too, will perform acts which are about their partner's pleasure (oral/fingering/using toys), and will continue sex even if they're done with PIV because they've orgasmed. But...these men are not the majority."
160,"People nonchalantly cutting the palms of their hands wide open for a few drops of blood and it heals fast. Who the hell is like ""lemme cut open the most used part of my body for this little spell"". It's all over fantasy and sci-fi shows but is always treated as ""normal"" and that's preposterous!"
161,"It did, what he meant to say was ""your shoelace is untied"""
162,"There isn’t the whole awkward thing about who pays- we simply take turns- when dating a woman 

Both of us cum when dating a woman. Sex isn’t done until both have cum

PMS is a bit of a nightmare when our cycles sync

Women are more helpful in general

It’s easy to fall into a comfortable loving but sexless relationship when there is no penis involved. This can lead to over eating and weight gain and eventual depression"
163,Ironic how he slut shames her when he’s the one who went behind her back and cheated. I really hope she’s doing okay. :(
164,"Agreed. Not only did I have to also have women's tailored suits/skirt-suits when I worked in the same situation, but I had to have a far larger variety of them or get judged negatively. My suits started at around $300 and went over $1000 depending on quality and style. My partner is a c-suite exec who has 6 amazing suits and hasn't had to replace more than one of them every few years of wear whereas I was fully expected to own enough for 3 full weeks without repetition and to buy new ones to fit whatever the newest fashion trend was for business women."

166,"A friend of mine has coworkers (male and female) where the girl is married but is continuously banging the dude and then got pregnant and didn't know who the father of her baby was. Literally everyone at works knows, and some even know her husband, but he is completely clueless to it all."
167,"me too. The unhappier I am, the more I avoid everything in life."
168,"Being perceived as ""creepy"" for being interested in someone, or being ignored completely, if you're unattractive.

Sometimes I feel like there's no way to make friends with men as a typically ugly female-passing person. Or even just talk to them! It's less obvious now but when I was in school I dealt with people (men usually) pretending I didn't exist or acting uncomfortable or apathetic when we were forced to interact. People who knew nothing about me, yet decided I wasn't worth any time or effort.

I think this kind of mirrors men's experience with being immediately judged by their appearance, or even their gender. Like how they talk about wanting to get to know a woman platonically, but being cut off by her needlessly saying ""I have a boyfriend!!"" when flirting was never part of the conversation. Or how men will complain about being perceived as creepy when generally being friendly, while a more attractive person's friendliness is much more welcome.
People will judge you for your appearance regardless of gender."
169,"Yeah women are softer in almost every way haha lips, body, hair, hands and even kiss softly and overall very gentle"
170,"Text messages.  I mostly find it annoying that people expect an instant response and get mad or hurt if they don't get one.  I don't like having to be on call 24/7, and for that reason I hate cell phones/cell phone culture.  If I give into pressure to give someone my number, I'm also giving up all my boundaries to be left alone in my free time."
171,"Knowing that I have to work my butt off to be able to live a comfortable financial life while you have this small portion of the population, that can act stupid/obnoxious or just be very good looking and have the best life they could ever ask for. It really grinds my gears."

Iceland was neat too, beautiful alien landscape, but food was ...more interesting than tasty and everything was insanely expensive."
175,Yes! I’ve seen guys commenting how it’s so easy a woman can just go out and have sex anytime. Like yeah if she doesn’t care about safety or even quality of sex considering she’s not guaranteed to orgasm like men usually are....
176,"LMN, OP? Cue ""ahh""."
177,"We always joked about combining our surnames into a new one.

178,"YES, all of the Friends usually dated people their own age but whenever they didn't (Ross and the student, Monica and Richard) the group gave them a hard time."
179,"Yes, for me that's called having anxiety. For me it's the rapid thinking and worrying that comes with anxiety and I just can't turn my brain off. Things that I think about include work, my friends, family, boyfriend, cat, my health, the books I'm reading, movies/tv I've watched, what's going on in the world, memories of the past, money, things I need to get done, thinking about the future, wondering about the meaning of life, thinking about how one day all my loved ones are going to die and how shitty that will be, etc."
180,"She should really look into filing a complaint/grievance for a HIPAA violation. They can get an enormous fine. I'm not sure if she would be able to sue, but she should really look into everything herself. That is TERRIBLE."
181,Well that's a neat way to start this thread :)
182,"- we had a math teacher at our school that used to marry women, get them pregnant and then drop them. he dated one of the history teachers and every other teacher in the school secretly hated the relationship. i was there when she told her two closest teacher friends she was pregnant (i read her lips) and they both looked absolutely gutted, all the while pretending to be happy for her. she had the baby, and then they moved from europe to a country where people can be killed for being bigamists. she had him LOCKED DOWN.

- when i was 16, i got my first saturday job in a shop. the shop's managers/supervisors were mainly people who had gone to school together and were about 19-21. they were busy planning a manager's wedding. she was 20 and had been with her boyfriend for like 4 years. she got married like 2-3 months after my first shift. our GM left, and we got a couple of new managers in. she got REALLY flirty with one of the new guys. they were really gross and ott touchy and flirty. anyway, she left her husband after maybe 9 months for this guy and now they have a kid and she's getting married again."

Once you can pick up HOW a person feels or expresses their love, you can learn it. 


For example, mine is touch and my fiancees is acts of service. That means that him building me a compost area in the yard is his way of showing me his love. 


I cuddle the hell out of him. 

Also, since we both know what each other really appreciates, if he's down I do things for him. If I'm down he cuddles me. 


It's not an easy read on a first date but it's a serious love hack to know that stuff!!"

187,My god mother got hit on by a giddy 20 something year old. After she told him she was 42 and old enough to be his grandmother he sheepishly rhymed “ you might be 42 but I’d still date youu!” Which made her laugh.
188,"Also, thinking that girls are just victims of bullying by other girls.  I was viciously bullied in middle school and it was 90% boys. Literally being followed home from school and called ugly and other things that wrecked me emotionally and psychologically, for no goddamn reason at all that I could ever discern.  I can only remember two times where girls were involved, and it was when they were joining in with boys who started it. One of those girls was otherwise pretty nice to me. Guess you had to do what you had to do, **Sara**. :(

""Boys will fight it out, but girls use their words and are so much more vicious!""

Try being a chubby, nerdy, painfully shy 12-year-old girl and you might be amazed at how creative boys can get with their words. 

This isn't to discount girls who were bullied by other girls but I have seen it said so many times and it makes me so, so angry."
189,I like how the blue dress in Broad City becomes reoccurring.
190,"During the day, tampon. 

While I sleep at night, pads. 

Why would that change just because I'm sleeing with my partner? If seeing an outline of my pad, through whatever bottoms I wear, bothers him: we can break up because he is a child, and then he can go home to his own bed."
191,"In conversations, characters too often use each other’s names when only in the presence of each other. Like, “Jane, did you hear the news?” I rarely say a person’s name when talking to her/him."
192,"It drives me insane. Recently my boyfriend called me out for hanging up and not saying bye (I did, he just didn't hear me. I'm not a monster!) and he was like ""you hung up like we were on a TV show"""
193,"&gt; when tv's are not all the way off and make a high pitched noise. i can ALWAYS here it.

Yes!  My ex would turn the PlayStation off but leave the tv on a dead input and I could always hear it. We would get ready to leave the house and I would tell him to go turn the tv off and he would argue EVERY FUCKING TIME that it was off because the screen was blank. You would think after like five or ten times he would believe me that I could hear the damn thing but it was always an argument."
194,"Thinking that women have no pressure on them to get a career, get a good salary, be successful or feeling worthless if they fail."
195,"Yes! They will be sitting and having breakfast - pancakes, eggs, etc. Sun is high and shining. As a bonus, after their leisurely breakfast they will go do some errand important to the storyline before heading to school. Do they get up 4 hours before school or what?"

200,"It's a tossup between Japan and Australia. The people were wonderful in both places, for the most part I didn't feel like they didn't want me there, and the sights were very different kinds of amazing. I think Japan may win because I like the food better, and the train system should be everywhere forever."
201,"the fact that my male best friend DIDN'T do this, and instead waited for me to break up the dude and decide for myself, was the deciding factor in me going with him. i might have been open to him saying something before then, but he would lose points for not respecting my relationship or my choices for sure."

210,"This wasn't me asking someone out, but just a piece of conversation between me and my now boyfriend when we first started talking.

He was 29 and talking about turning 30. Said something along the lines of ""I like to think I get better with age, like a fine wine or cheese"", to which I responded ""well I didn't know you before, but you're definitely fine now!""

That was last January and we're both still just as cheesy and sickening now!"
211,"I wonder if there are any other women who are as bad at flirting as I am. A guy I like would always smile at me and try to make eye contact with me, but I probably had a weird look on my face with my eye wide open."
212,"People on their phones when they're with other people, like how if you're at a restaurant with someone and they'll just sit there on their phone not saying a word. If they're texting it's fine, or even if someone called and it's important, but I feel like I'm gonna explode if all I want is a decent conversation and they won't get off Instagram to actually pay attention, so all I get is quarter-assed responses. Then they blame me and say ""well if you were interesting I wouldn't feel the urge to go on my phone!!1!"" *DUDE*, the reason I'm so boring to you is because you developed the attention span of a 4 year old after you bought your first iPhone in 2011, and you can't get past surface level small talk without getting distracted anymore."
213,"I got the smooth number slip from a waiter. I was in Paris and just having some wine at one of the cafe/bars near my hotel with my friend.

216,"I get really irritable and hide myself from the world. If it is during the week, I finish work and go home and isolate. I allow myself to not be productive at all (no cooking, cleaning or laundry). I play video games or watch TV that I deem ""comfort shows"" (Buffy, Firefly). Usually this does the trick! I can go to work the next day refreshed!"
217,I love how losing a nose ring in a butt is the most wholesome gossip on this entire thread.
218,"OMFG!  I had to ""break up"" with one of my friends because of this.

She also sat next to me at work, in the next cubicle.  Every single fucking e-mail she got, she would exclaim ""Oh!"" or ""Wow!"" or ""I didn't know that!"" or some shit along those lines, just for the attention that you would give her by asking her what she's talking about.  (I clued in really fast that this was just an attention tactic, and I started to ignore her)

&amp;#x200B;

It was so infuriating, and I literally couldn't get any work done because it would make me more and more mad throughout the day, and I'd just end up steaming about it and unable to concentrate on my work anymore.   (That was my own problem, because I let it get to me)

I eventually lost my shit and talked to my boss about it.  The next day she was moved to an entire different floor in our office, and she's no longer my problem.  :)"
219,"I work a minimum wage job, the boss is probably stealing my tips, pretty this job violates several workplace right laws... but question is, which of my $700 outfits should I wear to the $100 plate restaurant, I have a closet larger than the studio apartment I should be able to afford"
220,You guys should just swap last names.
221,Did that weird you out in the slightest at first?
222,"Childbirth always goes like this:

*gasp* “It’s time!”

*running and Lamaze breathing* 

*screaming*

*shot of crowded waiting room*

223,"Mine is JEW, if I marry my current boyfriend they will be JEWL."
224,Blind auditions for musicians in orchestras. It has made a huge impact where it has been implemented.
225,"Shame about crying. A lot of men were taught that boys/men don't cry and they seem to think that women are free to be emotional/to cry in public. The truth is that as a professional woman, I feel a lot of pressure not to show negative emotions and especially not to cry in the workplace/in general.  The last thing I want to be seen as by a coworker is weak or emotionally fragile. Or as a bitch."
226,"Me too! It's totally what a broke 26-year-old who impulsively bought an expensive dress would do, try and get as much use out of it as possible. Especially because she looked fantastic in it."

232,"Well fitted clothes are definitely an easy way to make you look out together!

My aunt works in the fashion/tailoring industry, so when I graduated she took my measurements and gave me 5 button up shirts in neutral colours. She knows I'm sort of person who wouldn't look or feel comfortable in dainty blouses, and that I find it hard to find shirts that fit me off the rack. She also got them made in material that doesn't need ironing.

I work in a fairly casual environment but whenever I wear those shirts, I always get complimented and I look and feel great! I need to buy that aunt a present next time I see her and thank her again..."
233,Office culture. It's like being on a first date from 9-5 every day. No one is truly who they are in real life because that shit would not fly in real life. All fake interaction and have to be friendly with people you'd never associate with in real life.
234,[removed]
235,"I read this on another subreddit of a mom who was tickling her child and every time the child would get so hysterical (from laughter) and screamed No,” the mom stops and says “when you ask, I always stop.” I feel like imparting this, that learning as a young child that your body is your own, that you are allowed to firmly draw boundaries, and that you can draw those boundaries as loudly as you want, is incredibly important for any gender. 

Both being able to defend yourself physically and the step before that, being able to loudly vocalized you don’t want something, and then on the other hand. to recognize when someone doesn’t want you to touch them, are all valuable skills. The onus isn’t just on an individual or a child to defend themselves, but for others to recognize boundaries as well. 

(My apologies if this comment has already been made)."
236,Teasing and poking fun at each other just works for my SO and I. Witty back and forth really gets us engaged and is our way of flirting with one another. We both just genuinely like to laugh so I love that I found someone who will make me laugh :)
237,"Simple patterns or solid color. Wearing a lot of blaring color is distracting, but well-placed color splashes look really nice. Avoid flashy accessories. Clothing should be fitted, but not overly tight. Dresses and skirts should be long enough that you don't risk flashing people and should be above your mid-chest. 

I went on pinterest and made a board of business casual styles after I found out my basic office dress code, and that was helpful for me to find out what looked nice together."
238,He’s the best. Only now he has to live with knowing that some random guy did a smoother job of asking me out than he did lmao.

244,"I don't know if this is what you were looking for, but I **hate** it when a character is brushing their teeth and then spits out the toothpaste and then walks away like they're done. They don't rinse! Okay, I get that the writers have a story to tell, but if you're going to go to the trouble of showing them brushing their teeth, why not take like three more seconds and have them rinse?!

I think that, when I was a kid, my parents tried too hard to keep me from swallowing my toothpaste, and it may have left some scars. I don't remember specifics, but...I hate the texture and the taste of toothpaste. (I brush my teeth every day and I use toothpaste every time, because I'm not an idiot, but unless I kind of dissociate, I hate every minute of it.)"
245,No shit. I can respect that.
246,I came to say the EXACT same thing.
247,"Judging by the questions we get here, some men don't seem to think women are troubled by thoughts at all."
248,"I was the one ghosted. We went on one date and tried to plan another but he had a lot going on. I realized I was always initiating conversations so when that happens I just stop and either let them ghost or let them reach out to me. 2 days later he texted me to ask how I was, I responded, and he never texted back.. a month and a half later he texted to apologize, said each day that went by he was more embarrassed to text me and he didn’t have a good reason why he didn’t reply in the first place, but he felt bad and wanted to make it right. We went out again and he said he didn’t realize he was the one that didn’t reply until a couple days later and was too embarrassed at that point to say anything. I asked why he bothered texting me over a month later and his response was that there were too many nights he was up thinking about it and wondering “what if.” Very sweet. Definitely taking it slow this time around though! Never know if he’ll lose interest and just ghost again, although he said he really doesn’t want to be that kind of person.. we’ll see!"
249,"Your BF sounds like a pretty good dude, too!"
250,"Surprisingly many seem to think we've never ever nodded in greeting, and that *the nod* is something sort of mysterious for us.

Reddit boys, it's not."
251,"This is a great way to handle it. I had some very energy-sucking roommates and I found the best (and likely healthiest) way of shutting it down was simply saying ""I can't help you properly with what you're going through, and you should talk to a therapist."""
252,"This actually reminded me of some kind of funny gossip I heard as a bartender. I had this customer named J. J was an old white haired oil field worker from Louisiana with a heart of pure gold. I was an oil field secretary before the bar, and was in the bar the night before I started working there, and he saw me counting my dollars to see what I could afford to order for dinner. He found that ridiculous, bought me a steak and a beer, and forced a hundred into my purse despite protests. 

Just to set the stage on what a sweet man he is.

Well he always showed me pictures of his three daughters, ranging from early to late teens. 

One night, he is drunker than I've ever seen and he motions me over. ""Hey Red, you know my youngest daughter isn't mine? They don't know that I  figured it out, but I know she's my best friend's girl. I was working off shore at the time. God dammit if I don't love her just the same though!""

""J, why is he still your best friend. ""

""Oh Red, you don't get it. I can't rilly blame him. You women can be so perutty. ""

I miss that guy a lot. Never saw him without a smile."
253,Hair loss/thinning hair
254,"This was a fascinating bit of information. As a straight guy, you changed the way I view sex for the better. I always knew it’s “about us both” in the bedroom but never considered that I still made *my* climax more or less *the* climax in the bedroom. Thanks for opening my eyes!"
255,And also The Middle!
256,"I'm in the middle of my transition, and when I came out I told my dad I wanted to change my last name because my biological father passed away a long time ago, and I no longer have any ties to his family.  He instead said that he would adopt me, even though I'm in my 30s. It's such a sweet sentiment, and since then I occasionally practice writing my new signature, but turns out, it doesn't look my different than my current one. Will still take a while to use it, since documentation takes a long time"
257,"My ex is going through his third divorce in less than a decade. He doesn’t know that I know. His wife called me and said he decided to move out because she wouldn’t give him the tv remote. When he left, he took off in a car she owns. He’s living with his parents now. They didn’t have any kids, but apparently the big issue in their divorce is going to be dividing up the debt...according to her, he racked up thousands in credit card debt buying PlayStation games. I’m not one to take joy in the misery of others, but he has consistently been an awful human being, so seeing him deal with the consequences of his behavior is entertaining."
258,I can dismiss people very easily because I never really learned how to communicate properly. My parents had a tumultuous marriage and everything that I learned about communication (or lack thereof) was through them. So I’ve ruined good friendships by just ending them rather than communicating properly and trying to fix the issue.
259,Seinfeld did the same where they all sit at the bar and can’t talk to each other it’s hilarious
260,"Thing is, a *lot* of men fail to put in the work then claim their female partners are among the ones who struggle greatly to climax. Instead of forging a true mind-body connection with them, they just supplement PIV (which is #1 in their eyes even though lots of women can't cum from it alone) with things they""learned"" from porn, then act surprised when she's not quickly and vocally on the edge of orgasm. A lot of times there's also an air of impatience/incredulity, so women get turned off because they feel like they're being an insatiable burden. As a result, they spare his ego and end the session themselves by saying it's hard for them to cum, making plans to finish themselves off later."
261,"There’s apparently a whole femcel movement. I spent some time reading their subreddit and they don’t seem as bad as the male incels, no talk about wanting to legalize rape and pedophilia and way more talking about getting plastic surgery, but still depressing as hell."
262,"TBF, in the 70s we were basically taught to expect shit like that from guys. Well, maybe not hiding in our closet, that's extremely creepy in any era. 

The one that shits me for this is Big Bang Theory. They were all so sexist all the time. Howard was obviously the extreme example. I remember an ep where Penny lost her shit with him for being a creepy perv (rightly so) and so he took to his bed for a week, sulking. Then the whole lot of them ganged up on her and pressured her into apologizing to him! Of course right at the end he just tried to assault her again. Oh, how hilarious."
263,"When I was sixteen a gas station clerk gave me his number over the intercom when I walked out. 
And I didn’t understand it so I had to go back in which was embarrassing. 
And he turned out to be a jerk anyways."
264,Oh yeah by telling the guy about my feelings
265,"Hanging up at the end of phone conversations without saying ""bye"" or ""goodbye""

267,"Yeah in all of those ""What do men experience that women don't?"" ask reddit threads it's GLARINGLY obvious they don't even acknowledge the existence of women who aren't white women they consider hot"
268,Too many.
269,No me but a friend . Had a one night stand got pregnant. Told the guy and co parented.  They got on well and so even started doing holidays Christmas birthdays together.  When baby was 4 they started dating. When baby was 5 they bought a house together.  And so far lived happily ever after (baby is 8)

272,"People in television shows are rarely show spending large amounts of time watching television or playing with their phones, even if the characters are supposed to be ordinary people.

The characters who play ordinary people drink coffee and talk in coffee shops rather than get online and ignore each other."
273,I grew up in the 80s in a house like that. Front staircase came down by front door and into living room. Back stairs came down by garage into back of kitchen. Average sized house compared to friends/other people i knew. Never understood why we had two staircases. Lol.
274,"Intimacy. For me, I feel such a deeper emotional connection with women than with men. But I'm more physically attracted to men and obviously when it comes to sex, the physical attraction usually wins out."
275,"Being ignored on online dating apps.

Men on Reddit seem to think that online dating is fucking easy for women.  It is not.  I get ignored by matches just as much as men probably do.  I start conversations on Bumble and people don't respond just as often as men seem to complain that women do.  I've had promising conversations drop off into nothing.

And even after an actual date, I've had promising first dates turn into guys ignoring me/fading on me/etc. 

Online dating/dating sucks for everyone involved.  It's not just men getting rejected and being treated rudely/unfairly."
276,"Cool that’s kind of what I do! Just had my first date today and I made my date blush lol, all I did was wrap my arm around her and played with her hair. She seemed to love it! Although I don’t think I’d be able to pull of a sexual joke, mostly because I think I wouldn’t be smooth enough to just say it"
277,"Good points!

Might be easier to list some ways to avoid looking UNprofessional...

**List of no-no's:**

- Poor hygiene (including cigarette smell).

- Any clothes/accessories that are damaged, stained, faded, or worn-looking.

- Clothes that don't fit.

- Poor posture.

- Immature behavior/attitude.

- Tardiness or excessive absences.

- Being unprepared (pens and paper for example)."
278,Hence my catchphrase: “It’ll be alright in about a week!”
279,"You’re amazing, and I’m sorry you get so much shit from sexist jabronis."
280,"Personally, I am a lot pickier with women and as another post mentioned the “sample size” is much smaller. Meeting women is more difficult  because I would never just approach a one out in public with an assumption that she make also be bi. I like women more than men but I’ve had far less girlfriends than boyfriends due to this. 

I find it that it’s easier  to get close to a women in a short period of time as opposed to a man. I’d be a lot more hesitant in talking to a man about my period etc on the first date.  Girls seem to appreciate each other’s bodies more and sex is on a much deeper level. I’m much more confident about my body with a women but sometimes less confident in sexual performance initially. I feel like women really “make love” to each other and time  slows down. There is never the race to finish. If you want to fondle each other all day then you can. In heterosexual sex you can definitely “make love” as well in the same sense but I feel like it’s not as stable of a feeling and it varies... this isn’t a bad thing- I’m just not sure how to explain it. Sex with a women just seems more emotional and deeply connected...like all the time. Women are all so different but I find that we communicate well and that helps to propel the relationship."
281,"I also always thought that no one knew it was happening to me. Then one day I was with my friend on the playground and she said “I don’t like [bully’s name]” and I asked her why and she said “because she’s mean to you”. I remember not knowing how to feel because I was embarrassed about always being bullied by this girl, but I also felt a little better knowing that someone supported me."
282,"About two years ago. I was on a terrible 3rd date with a guy at a young professional social event.  Ended up chatting with a guy who was a friend of my date’s friend.  He was super nice and seemed genuinely interested in what I was saying.  Not to mention he was so cute and super tall (which I love as a 5’11 lady).   I told my date that I was going to the restroom and went on the search for a pen and paper. Luckily an activity they had was origami folding.  I snagged a piece of origami paper and a pen from the raffle ticket table.  I wrote him a note with my number, explaining he seemed cool and I was only on a second date with this guy (I figured 2nd seemed better than 3rd).... he ended up texting me that night, we grabbed drinks the next day, and got married last month :)"
283,"Dogs are all weirdly intelligent. They all know tricks and respond to voice commands (even if that response is to refuse to perform)

284,"As a goose, I can see why that would annoy you."
285,"so...people meeting at work, prioritizing relationship over job, but wanting to be professional by having one quit, and then living happily ever after?"
286,"Monica and Richard always creeped me out in a spectacular way... *Maaaaaybe* the age difference is okay in some weird reality, but if the person is friends with your parents?! Knew you as a child?! You know their kid/s?! That is just super creepy on so so man levels"
287,"yeah, it'd work on me."
288,My seventh grade son told me an 8th grader might be pregnant.
289,"Hahaha, I grew up in a small town and once a month they had kareoke (sp?). I can't sing to save my life, but my friends loooooves it. It we went and someone sang 'her songs'- same thing, we had to leave."
290,"they treat literally everybody else, from the next door neighbor to the shopkeeper to your own friends and family like gold. but when it comes to you, they suddenly can't be bothered to be pleasant."
291,"I'm from South Texas and I knew almost nobody who made you take your shoes off when coming into the house. In my house, it was considered presumptuous if you came in and immediately took off your shoes, like you were taking the liberty of making yourself at home before invited. The ground outside is probably dry and hard so there's not much to track in, and meanwhile we're all Texas-hot and sweaty so no one wants to see or smell your socks. My house also benefited from not having carpet.

I knew two exceptions to this rule: my ex's house, where you didn't have to take shoes off at the door, just before you went into the carpeted area. And a friend of mine who was Asian, so I remember always assuming it was an Asian thing. Theirs was the only house that had a designated place for shoes by the door."
292,"A friend of mine’s husband was acting weird and being secretive with his phone etc. One day she waited until he went in the shower and looked at it. She found that he had been hiding a six month long affair with a 20 year old girl at work, he is 40. He was having sex with both of them and he contracted chlamydia from the girl and passed it on to her as well. What a fuckin shit-show."
293,"This.  Don't teach kids things in black and white.  There are many steps to be taken, before things might need to be escalated to a physical level to get it to stop.

Besides that, I think it's a good idea for everyone to learn at least somewhat, how to defend themselves.  Even a little bit of training can make worlds of difference for people.  Be careful though, especially women, or people looking to take young girls to learn.  There's a lot of BS out there, ESPECIALLY things labeled as self defense classes.  Unfortunately, it seems to target women even more often. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G10uv57Romo) of someone pointing out one of those BS types of videos.

A basic boxing stance and showing how to throw the punches correctly, how to move, and head movement, alone would make worlds of difference for most people.  They don't need to drill it to perfect form, or snap reflexed, but knowing how to shift and control your weight, move, defend, and punch, are things that can be learned decently without getting too deep into boxing.

For going beyond just basic defense, I'd say to learn Kick Boxing or Boxing.  Another good option is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  That is my preferred method, because I do a physical job, and BJJ has a lower risk of injury then something involving striking. Also, getting into a bare knuckle fight, there's a good chance of seriously hurting your hands.  I've already had serious damage to both hands, but I need them for work, so I don't want to put them under the strain of striking, even with gloves, on a regular basis. That's also why I like learning to defend myself in a way that wouldn't rely on hoping my hands don't break before the fight is over.

I think most parents hope their child never has to fight or even hit someone in anger or defense.  But this is one of those cases it's probably far better to be safe, then sorry.  It should also go without saying, that teaching a child how to hit, has to go hand in hand with teaching when to hit."
294,"Thoughtfulness. When my husband was a full time student, he cleaned the house. Not just cleaned up after himself but vacuumed the shared rooms, wiped down the kitchen, put everything away, kept the living room tidy.

When he went back to work, and I was still working 16 hours a day, he still did as much as he had time and energy for.

Even now, he cleans up at least after himself, if not cleaning in general.

It means I'm not ever left going, ""am I the only one who gives a shit about this house and hygiene?""

I've had moments where I've thought, ""I need to clean X"" and I get home, and he's already cleaned X and Y.

For me, it shows that he's an adult who appreciates the home we have and maintains it. He does emotional labour.


Also, he took on my dogs as his own. Now we have four, one I had when we met, one I got before we lived together and two we got together (kinda. I brought them home, with every intention of only keeping them for a night, but they proved... Difficult to rehome) and they're all ""our dogs.""

Someone once asked him why he had so many dogs, particularly big ones. And he said, ""well my missus loves them..."" and the other guy goes, ""and you love your missus. Makes sense."""
295,"I speak to them once. If I need to speak to them a second time, about the same issue, that conversation is the last we will have. 

I don't deserve to be a human punching bag, regardless of whatever feelings they are having. I spent far too many years letting it happen, letting people take everything out of me, telling them it bothered me and then letting them continue. I'm not going to do that anymore."

298,"&gt; I find it a lot harder to flirt with women or tell if they’re interested in me than men

This is the #1 thing for me. I find that women are usually much more touchy-feeling in the first place so it's a lot more difficult to distinguish whether they like you in a friendly way or in a flirty way. ""Is this a date, or do you like me as a friend? Are you flirting with me or are you just being nice? Are you into women?"" Non-verbal communication can be hard.

I find that you can almost tell right away if a man likes you or not."
299,"I worked a restaurant/coffee shop and we had a crowd of regulars who would come in and they eventually all became friendly. There were definitely times where it happened exactly how you said: they’d come in and none of their friends would be there, so they’d have a coffee and read the paper and if no one showed up after awhile, they’d leave"

303,"No one gets together or breaks up for normal reasons. Like they never go on a few dates, find things they have in common, and get slowly more and more into each other. It’s like a sudden whirlwind of lust and romance with no actual logic as to why they would be good together. Break-ups are always sudden and based on a one-time event."

310,"I had been chatting with a fellow I met on OkCupid, and said something along the line of “I like to eat food right about this time of day.” He said something along the lines of, “I also enjoy food.” Anyway we’re married now.

His play, before I said that, was to offer me a bucket of fishtank gravel, and I didn’t realize that was a play, so I think mine was definitely the smoother option."
311,Met my husband online and talked consistently on the phone and text messages every day for six months. Then one day he dropped off the face of the earth. Radio silence besides the odd text here and there for three months. Then one night after I walked out of my job he texts me the first real text asking me how I was. We have talked every day since and have been married for three years now with two kids. He had some painful family stuff come up and he needed space to deal with those things. He’s my best friend and I wouldn’t want to spend a single day away from him again.

315,"Yeah! Like I said, the MIL is actually not a wretched person and she’s shaped up. But I think she came to see her own children as not infalliable through her younger son’s experience. The worst part is that this was in a poor country, so the parents had spent a lot of money on their sons’ educations, and then instead of their second son going to tertiary he went to work to support his children. The first son is a teacher now which over there is a very respectable job."
316,My sister in law is second generation Chinese-American but this is one thing she definitely absorbed from her parents. She just about has an aneurism if anyone walks into her house without removing their shoes.

318,"Or even if they don’t require bespoke, custom fit suits, the men can but their suits somewhere like men’s wear house for sometimes $150 a pop, then spend a bit more to have them all tailored.

319,"Road rage. Like, why? Why are you expending all this energy on being mad at something or someone you can’t control. Even if someone did something reckless or stupid, you yelling at them isn’t going to do any good. They probably already feel stupid and embarrassed anyway."

322,"oh god same. i had physical limitations as a kid and the false encouragement the teachers gave was so phony. 

PLUS, how the hell am i supposed to cope with the added pressure of doing something difficult, knowing someone encouraged me and thus, expect me to achieve it? it kind of pisses me off that they put that on me, it's not fair to decide *for me* what i am capable of."
323,"I try to think of things as experiments (whatever the outcome, I'm gathering data and learning) or adventures (whatever the outcome, I got to have the experience). 

These only work sometimes, but they help."
324,"oh my god, yes. passive aggressive attention seeking with vague reactions gets me too.

''huh.''

*''huh''*

how about that?

*clicking and scrolling* mmmm really, how interesting!

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF especially when they know it's a topic i dislike/leads to arguing and they're trying to find an ''in'' to discuss it with me"
325,"A good friend of mine was seriously considering hypenating her and her fiancee's names. Her last name is Brown. His is Kok (pronounced ""cock"").  We had a come to Jesus talk about if she really wanted to be Mrs. Brown-""Cock"""
326,Do a small intimate wedding and a big honeymoon instead.
327,"I feel called out lol, I do this exact thing. In fact, I'm doing it now."
328,"Yes! My first thought is always ""Fingers crossed there's a decent YouTube tutorial for this!"""
329,"In a thread on this sub recently, sex was being discussed and the fact that a lot of men consider their orgasm the end of sex whether their partner has orgasmed or not. More than one man in the thread took the time to explain that after a man has orgasmed they're tired and not as turned on anymore and are more grossed out by things that five minutes ago felt arousing.   


It seemed like genuine breaking news to them when women replied with ""Yeah... us too."" It didn't seem to have occurred to them that women are also tired and less aroused after an orgasm. But that doesn't ever mean that our orgasm marks the end of the encounter. If it did we would undoubtedly (and fairly, probably) be labelled as bad lovers...but suggesting that of men who do the same thing was unfair."
330,"We met on Tinder and went on two dates. I had a lot of mental health issues going on at the time, was suicidal, heart broken over another guy, and was dealing with (avoiding) a man who assaulted/abused me trying to get back in touch. 


I realized on the second date that it wasnt fair to him to continue this as soon as I knew I wasn't interested. I didnt know how to explain all of this to a guy I met twice so I just ghosted.


I moved on, got therapy, and focused on getting better in the months following. I thought about him occasionally thinking ""he was a great guy, if only I was ready, I really blew a great opportunity"".


We then matched on tinder again after I reinstalled the app. He asked if I remembered him and I said ""of course, you were great and I ghosted you, I'm sorry for that.""


We started dating again and after a few dates became boyfriend and girlfriend. A month later we moved intogether. We're about to hit our 1 year anniversary next week and it's been fantastic ever since. Ive literally never been closer to another person nor have I ever been treated with as much respect and empathy, even from family. 


If you find this I love you Brandon!!"
331,"I'm straight but my friends and I all unanimously agree snuggling with each other is the best.  They're so soft.  Love my partner, but he can't really compare to that kind of pillowy comfort.  Maybe I can convince him to gain some weight."
332,"I live in NYC and this actually happens.  Whenever you see this, it's actually Dad's money."
333,My mom told me at 20 weeks pregnant (after 3 previous miscarriages) that she hoped the baby died because I was going to be such a horrible mother it was better off dead than with me. Needless to say I have not spoken to her since and she has not and will never meet my daughter.
334,"&gt;Also emotions are seen as weak in men BECAUSE it’s seen as a “woman thing”.

Unless it's uncontrolled rage, uncontrollable lust, or screaming vindictiveness.  Because those aren't emotions, they're manly things for manly men!"
335,"When I was watching Mad Men and reading Tom and Lorenzo's Mad Style posts, I was surprised to find that characters actually do repeat outfits on that show. 

[Example](https://tomandlorenzo.com/2010/06/mad-style-betty-draper-s1-part-1-2/) with Betty:

&gt;This is the outfit she wore to her first therapist appointment. Betty’s not so well off that she doesn’t repeat outfits. Clearly, this is her go-to “day in the city” outfit. The exuberance of the skirt and the overall doll-like quality (Peggy nervously proclaims “You’re so pretty in that light!”) set her far apart from Peggy’s no-nonsense business attire."
336,His last name is Alexis. So I pictured myself buying a Lexus and getting a personalized plated that said Mrslexus.
337,"Light flow: Panty liner

Light - medium flow: Small tampon + pantyliner 

Medium flow: normal pads / medium tampon

Medium - heavy flow: nightpads/medium tampon + panty liner

High flow: nightpads / big tampon + panty liner

Superflow: same as high flow + prayers"
338,"My current roommate has a girlfriend, refer to her as A, and has been dating her for roughly 6-7 months. Prior to this he had a crush on a  girl, refer to her as K, for something like a year but that whole time she had a boyfriend. K had feelings for him as well but not enough to break up with her boyfriend.
Anyways, my roommate starts dating his girlfriend and like 2 months later the girl he had been into becomes single. I actually overheard him talking to K on the phone one day while he was already dating A and giving her relationship advice but all of it was to the jist of ""its not working out with your boyfriend you should end it"".
Continuing, the rumor i heard just last week is that apparently at the beginning of this semester, roughly 4 months into his relationship, he went to K's dorm and spilled his heart out to her to the tune of ""K i want to date you, I like you a lot and I'll break up with A if we can be together"". 
K smartly rejected him and A later heard he was at K's dorm and upon confronting him about it he said ""oh she asked me to come over because she wanted to confess her feelings to me""."
339,"It’s always seemingly been hypothesized that men struggle with commitment issues more than women, but in my own experience, myself and some of my closest friends (collegiate aged males) seemingly struggle with the exact opposite. 

While the males still have some “hedonistic tendencies” it seems that we have the issue of wanting to commit, with women who get cold feet due to being busy, societal or personal pressure to ‘experience more,’ and past trauma. 

YMMV"
340,A smaller male cuttlefish will sometimes disguise himself as a female to try and avoid fights and woo the ladies that dont like the big aggressive males!
341,Hide away and cry to let the stress out
342,"-That embarrassing thing I did about 20 years ago

- I need to drink more water

- I need to work out

- I need to get my eyebrows done

- I need to clean the floors 

-I need to go through the kids drawers and take out all the stuff that doesn’t fit

-...Then take said clothes to the Salvation Army. Uuhhgg that’s going to suck. It’s in the middle of town and there’s not parking. 

- How am I going to get my kids to eat more veggies? I should find new recipes...

- X kid keeps picking on Y kid. What did I do wrong? Am I bad mom? I’m probably a terrible mom...

- Y kid is spends too much time watching TV. I wish I was one of those Pinterest moms... carol is such a good mom. Why can I be like carol. I bet carol takes speed. She has to. There’s no way her house is that clean with 5 kids and a new baby. Wtf carol...?

- uuuhhggg...husband is snoring maybe if I poke him, he’ll stop. Nope...didn’t work...maybe if I just...kick him...oops too much. 

Etc...etc...lol"
343,I have a coworker that has a habit of doing this so he can control the conversation. He will literally laugh to himself until someone asks him what’s funny. I learned this quickly and pretend I don’t hear anything he says.
344,"This boy I acted in a play with in college came and sat next to me in the hall while I was writing in my journal-he asked what I was writing about and I replied with, ""My autobiography!"" even though I was actually writing about HIM bc I had a crush on him. A couple weeks later my roommate called me at work and said that someone had left an odd package at our front door. She brought it to my job-it was a parcel wrapped in brown paper. I unwrapped it and there was a single cowboy boot, and inside the boot there was a little book entitled, ""Zebras and Squashed Tomatoes; The FrankieRay25 Story."" It was my illustrated biography, in which my mother was an alien, my father a monster. She died, my alien dad got deported, I lived alone in a box off of coffee grounds and spare cheese. Finally, I made friends and they threw me a party, but before the party I got a rare disease and died and nobody came to my funeral.   
We dated for three years."
345,"Something that (most) men don’t realize: sex is not always good for a woman. In fact, I’d argue it’s most often bad/not good than it is really good. For men, basically any time they’re having sex, it’s the best feeling in the world. 

I can speak to this from a certain point of experience because I have both given and taken the D. Giving D: basically always awesome. Taking D: enjoyable maybe half the time."
346,"On the bus, kept it to one word answers and then turning to look out the window. He kept nudging my arm to talk to me anyway. Of course, had I outright said ""leave me alone,"" that would have been too much."
347,Glass Animals have some really slow beats that tend to get me thinking about sexy time. Also Marian Hill - One Time.
348,"That's cute! Before I got married I claimed the Gmail account with my new name, so I can relate."
349,"I’m sorry for your loss, hope you are doing ok."
350,People spectating while you try to parallel park is one of the nine circles of hell.
351,"See I go for the try hard. My boyfriend loves to do the thing where I say, complain about a game not being hard enough he will say something like ""I've got something hard enough."" I usually giggle and smack him away but he can still make me blush"
352,"Does a friendship kinda relationship count?  It wasn’t anything like a best friends forever type friendship.  More than casual, less than BFFs.  When we hung out, it was very fun.  Commonalities, close enough personalities to complement well with each other, similar backgrounds.  Great conversations. It had the makings of a BFF type storyline. 

The hiccup to this was, it was only great when his other friends weren’t available.  So I was very much the plan B friend.  Even plan XYZ sometimes.  The last resort friend.  You all know what I mean.  

We had a great friendship during the summer break because all his other friends were on family vacations or whatever.  But as soon as they returned (most of them anyway), he pretty much stopped any communications with me.  And it hurt , I’ll admit, I’m only human afterall.  But I always knew what I was getting into.  It wasn’t as though he didn’t make it known what kinda friend he was/is.  He was very charismatic.  I guess that’s why everyone flocked around him. Just got many friends and needs to have them all around him.  An extrovert.  I’m an introvert.  Crowds tire me out very quickly.  So I didn’t really mesh into his clique very well.  Not that he or they or I made much effort to be part of it. 

Anyways, fast forward half a decade later (present time now), of not too much communication, a greeting text here and there, and all of a sudden he wants to hang out again.  And I’ll admit at first, I was elated.  But then I thought about it afterwards and declined the offer.  I don’t think I wanna go into that hole I dug for myself again.  It was very difficult to crawl back out.  

So there really isn’t any ending to my experience.  He’s still around.  I’m still the same, he’s still the same.  No miraculous BFF situation coming about any time soon.  But there’s my experience."
353,It sucks that a lot of these are for unwanted/inappropriate advances and not something cutesy or romantic.
354,That was a whole thing in the 50s. My grandmother talked about it when I was a kid.
355,Depends on the last name - if it was common they probably got used to it
356,"Persistent mouth noises. Coughing, slurping, groaning. I hate when someone keeps coughing. I understand clearing your throat or having to cough but after cough 4 or 5 I start to get so annoyed. Even with myself."
357,"It depends on the child. Raised my sister’s, and the oldest is the kind of kid who of she’s 10 minutes late and hasn’t called you, you should worry. The youngest is probably just fine and will call in four hours to tell you about the insane thing she did instead."
358,"Not being able to get laid. In my experience, the idea that most women can find sex whenever they want is pure fantasy. It *might* be easier to find random people willing to have sex with you as a hetero woman, but then we have to worry more about our personal safety when alone with members of the opposite sex.

Plus, I’ve always suspected that if I actually went up to a stranger at a bar and said “Hi. Want to bang?” he’d be so surprised and weirded out he would say no."
359,"This!! When I was younger I was called Godzilla by boys and girls because of how ugly they thought I was, and they said my hair was such a shitty brown that it looked green, hence the nickname. No one wanted to touch me or even sit too close to me, much less date me.

I understand the bitterness and wanting so desperately to just be naturally pretty like the other girls and get dates and go to prom and all that, but ultimately I decided to focus on my health and hobbies and worked really hard to stop fixating on my appearance. 

Now I put way less effort into trying to look my best and just try to be good to people and my social life is better than ever. I started building up other women, even ones who were prettier than me and that I was initially very jealous of and bitter towards. I started to see them as real people with real insecurities just like mine. Girls I saw as supermodel status also got bullied for their looks and thought they were ugly, some even had it worse than I did. 

I worry about communities like femcel because I feel like they foster hate, even if it’s not as bad as regular incel groups, and to me empathy is the only cure to hate and these insecurities a lot of us developed growing up regarding our looks."
360,"Or itch! Especially if you’ve recently shaved. Whenever guys scratch their balls in public they’re like “it’s itchy, I can’t help it”. Yes you can, go to the bathroom and do it in private, and wash your hands afterwards like an adult."
361,"It's freezing cold in the north, but hardly anyone wears anything on his head. I can't unsee it."
362,"I have definitely felt that competitive judgement from other women but for me, it has always been straight women rather than WLW. My theory is that straight women may be viewing you as competition, whereas WLW are viewing you as attractive, but with an added understanding that men lack - an understanding that societal standards of a woman's body aren't realistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, this is definitely a huge generalisation - please, nobody come for me just because I left out the word 'some' a few times, lol."
363,"Me, playing volleyball: \*spikes ball but it's out\*

Teammate: It's okay, shake it off. You've got this.

Me: SHUT THE HELL UP, GAVEN."
364,"The house in The Middle was poorly decorated, messy, and one story!"
365,"On the other hand my cousin's family are the only ones in the whole country with their last name (a Polish name that became misspelled somehow). So if he found his date had the same last name, it would be because it was his sister."
366,"I was telling this guy about how this was my first year where I could openly attend Pride, and on and on about how I can be openly bisexual in the city. Later in the day, he sort of brushes my cheek, and goes, 'now, do you just sort of glitter like that because you're queer, or did you put on sparkly makeup?' Idk if it would have worked on everyone, but i felt real cute and real glittery."
367,How I met your mother
368,suck it up and just fucking do it.
369,"I feel like I have no game with women, yet have great game with men. I don't know if it's because I'm not as attractive to women, or if I don't let my sexuality show. 

I had a huge crush on one of my lesbian friends. I'd ask her out to bars, to dinners, everything. She didn't even realize I was bisexual until I told her a story about my horrific experience with my second girlfriend (my first one was great). 

As for the differences, aside from ease of communication, I've found that any dating/relationship situation poses its own individual problems. So I don't think I can really compare solely by gender. Especially because my current SO (who is a male) communicates better than anyone I've ever been with in my life."
370,"it all looks so perfect too.... like the most decadent cinnamon rolls, perfectly even waffles, immaculately cooked pancakes..... why! why do they hurt me this way? please just have me on set."
371,"Archer kind of changed it up also. Same style, different colours."
372,"On the flip side - as a bisexual woman I definitely notice I am attracted to more ~imperfections~ from women as opposed to men. I think men’s bodies are hot when they are the idealized media version of what hot men look like but I like a lot more diversity wrt body types of women. Which I’m sure is just because I AM a woman who loves herself and her imperfections :) but def think it’s interesting! Empathy can be so difficult and there’s a million little ways we might not have it when we should, so I love love love discussions like this."
373,"Yeah it's a moo point, it's like a cow's opinion it doesn't matter."
374,The clinic did that on purpose. I am telling you.
375,If they bother you so much why did you use one? You could have used an exclamation point to show upsetting periods are instead.
