0,"You can look at it from this angle:

**Positive traits for the person being ""rejected"":**

* \- Has a better understanding of what they want.
* \- Are more confident in relationships when they do decide to get into them.
* \- Will likely have a easier time finding another healthy relationship after a breakup. Because you know what you want.
* \- Find it easier to trust people.
* \- People find it easier to trust you.
* \- Have higher emotional intelligence.
* \- Are a better communicator.
* \- Doesn't emotionally hold back and keeps it 100 with people.
* \- Has clear goals in other areas of life.
* \- Tends to be more content and happy with life

**Now think of the downside the person doing the ""rejecting"" has to go through:**

* \- Has to reevaluate what they do want.
* \- Might go through some soul searching after which isn't always the most pleasant thing to do.
* \- Might later on regret the decision.
* \- Aren't as confident in their own skin.
* \- Feels unsure about their future.
* \- Will have some form of guilt manifest as a result of not being open before.
* \- They will have reflect if the reason really was they weren't into you OR was it caused by another insecurity but this was the way it was projected?
* \- Will have to face their own set backs as the next person they are with may bring them to light.
* \- Might have internal struggles in being able to identify what happiness is. (i.e. repeating statements such as I wont be happy unless I have XYZ) This can be a problem with people who aren't comfortable in their own skin and seek happiness externally rather than internally

I hope this approach of seeing the situation helped you!"
1,I much prefer bare legs over tights or pantyhose.
2,I look like trash so I don't care.
3,Stare them down and hope they like what they see
4,"Unless you‚Äôre unusually tall, you can find out for yourself by spending a few bucks at a drugstore. I doubt anyone will care. Tights are more expensive, but just imagine your pantyhose being less itchy and softer."

6,"ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they‚Äôre not uncomfortable to me , and I love how smooth they make my legs look &amp; feel. If you‚Äôre wearing the right size they feel like nothing . If they‚Äôre too small they‚Äôre gonna feel weird and itchy."
7,When we started hanging around the same people and I realized the venting we did with one another didn't stay between us from her side. Being put on the back burner until she needs money. Wonders why I don't open up to her but never makes me feel as though my feelings are valid. We're still friends but I'm definitely more distant.
8,"Bad Blood by Bastille, it's been six years and still the only album I know word for word."
9,"I do a wet set at night--put it in sponge or twisty spiral rollers or pin curls or even rag curls. (I love retro). Most often, I do the spiral curls. I take out the curlers in the morning, use my fingers to comb through gently, and then brush them out. They stay all day. I don't like to use heat on my hair and I suck at using tools.

I am not a hairdresser, but you might want to ask yours next time you go if he/she can recommend any type of product or curling method that will work well with your type of hair."
10,Very true. He wasn‚Äôt a good communicator period. And when I‚Äôd bring stuff up that bothered me he would turn it around on me and then I‚Äôd end up feeling bad.
11,"You make a good point about not worrying about them being friends. I‚Äôve never had an ex I would want to spend any alone time with since we‚Äôve broken up, I guess I felt like our friendship ended with our relationship. I don‚Äôt want to be a toxic monogamist with the new person I‚Äôm seeing but I think they‚Äôre wanting to try salvaging a friendship with their recent ex and it makes me just a little uncomfortable. It‚Äôs pretty recent and they were very serious so I guess to me it just sounds like a recipe to get cheated on, but you‚Äôre right about it either happening or not happening, it doesn‚Äôt matter if I try and control the situation."
12,22
13,"I was 18, it was the morning before our senior skip day."
14,Time. Its as simple as that.
15,[removed]
16,"Thank you so much for the message and sharing your experience. Life is tough, I am sure I will be fine soon. And I am super happy for you to find your prince! I wish you all the happiness in life."
17,"Embarrassed, eh. Disappointed."
18,Anything in my inbox is to be completed. Anything I have finished gets moved to a separate folder (and organized into subfolders based on what they're about). I also leave post-its on my computer screen if I have to leave for a meeting or for the day so i remember to complete something I was halfway through. I get interrupted a *lot* so post-its save my sanity.
19,No way it suckkkkkks. No freaken way!!!
20,This is exactly why I'm staying single until my kid is off to uni. I don't want to even have to wonder about it - it's better for everyone.
21,"I did two things. A) I changed what I wanted to be more in line with my life today. B) I realized that what I wanted from my life would make me sad/alone in the end. My mom is very fond of saying that ""Who you are when you are 10 isnt who you are when you are 25."" Don't let who you were define who you should be."
22,"Tights can be uncomfortable only because I don‚Äôt like anything restrictive around my waist.  I prefer holdups in black or nude.  They‚Äôre warm, super comfy and a lovely velvety or silky feeling against your legs.  The only time they‚Äôre annoying is when your legs need shaved or waxed and the hairs get caught in between the material."
23,"No social life. I live far from all my family so I have no support or way to have a ''day off'' (when I lived near them I had no issues with this).  
  
Also I dread being sick or getting into an accident and, say, have a long stay at the hospital. I have no idea how we'd cope.  
  
Enforcing certain rules. I really struggle with not falling into a roommates situation with my kid. Teenagers are tricky."
24,That quote is amazing and I didn't know how badly I needed to see that.
25,"I was heading to Europe from Australia on a solo backpacking trip of 3 months. We had tentatively played with the idea of her meeting me in Spain later on in the trip (Spain being the starting point of my travels, and Iceland the end) When I told her I couldn't fit my travel plans around her holiday -which she had not yet booked- she lost her shit and told me I was ""dead to her"""
26,"I had a bf who financially supported nothing. He wouldnt even support the small amount of rent I asked him to pay when I was having a hard time. And at one point I asked myself- how is this guy helping me? The only thing good about the relationship is that he listened to me. He never even took me to dinner he was so cheap and I found myself feeling sorry for myself when I saw other guys saying they were taking their gfs out for their bdays. That was the saddest part.  I cooked for him, I paid for everything, I gave him sex. How was he helping me in return? It needs to be a give and take relationship, if not get out of it."
27,Armani Si for winter and evenings and Chloe for summer and daytime
28,"&gt;When I'm upset or angry with my SO I ask him to leave me alone. But I do not want him to REALLY follow through with that though!

Would you stay if this were someone else?

&gt;It makes me angrier that he'll leave

""Wow I am so pissed off he listened to me and respected my boundaries."" - You"
29,Do it for yourself and nobody else. Dont listen to negative people. Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments - love has to come from within first.
30,There wouldn't be a relationship between me and that person. Sounds like they have a lot to work out on their own. It also raises some flags about them possibly not being able to be alone. It just seems like a huge emotional mess.
31,"Lots of therapy. It really helped. Still things linger from the abused years, but all in all I went on to have a very healthy relationship afterwards. I still have triggers all these years later, but without therapy I would be in a much worse condition."
32,"I think it would depend on how ""together"" this current partner and I are.  If we were in a serious relationship, I wouldn't mind talking to them about their previous experience/helping them work through it. If we had only just gotten together I would feel inclined to think it was none of my business/I'd prefer not to know about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if they want to be friends with their ex, that's fine. The way I see it, if they're going to cheat on me it's going to happen whether I try to control their social interactions or not. Cross that bridge if/when I come to it. I don't really think cheating is ""preventable"" in the case of new/young relationships, if you're with a cheater they'll cheat on you, if you're not with a cheater then they won't."
33,"Tights are generally opaque and made out of thicker material. Pantyhose are much thinner and usually sheer. Tights can often be different colors (black is popular but I have seen a lot of colors) whereas pantyhouse tends to be some shade of tan, beige, or occasionally off-black. Tights are more durable. You can also get more patterns with tights."
34,Not keeping my mouth shut- reacting without thinking it through.
35,"He was I thought my soul mate . I was convinced because I used to have this fantasy about a guy named andrew would be my soul mate in high school. I did drawings of how he would look and his hairdo. My first bfs name was Robert. His name was Robert Andrew and he had the exact hairdo Ive always dreamed of. I even had run into him earlier at jury duty and thought OMG hes so hot but he would never go for a girl like me...and then he turned up later on eharmony! And I realized he was the guy I saw! Maybe I was trying too hard when I met him because there were high hopes he was the one with all the ""signs"". We dated but he treated me badly so he had to go. It was disappointing. It was only me that thought he was the ""one"". His personality was bad so it was a no go and he was an a-hole."
36,"If I love someone I want to retribute that attention and love in the same level. I would also envision doing things with that person in the long run.  
  
If not, I'm probably just getting caught up in the attention and we're all better off staying friends."
37,"I was 18, it was the morning before our senior skip day."
38,"She would abuse me (verbally and physically) ""for my own good"" or ""because she has depression and needed an outlet"", always followed by ""im sorry"". I would say I want out of the friendship, she would threaten to harm or kill herself if i did so. She would make fake accounts to cyberbully me and make me feel like shit. She would abuse and humiliate me in front of guys for their attention, and if the guy fell bad for me and wanted to help me or god forbid he had a crush on me instead of her, i would get beatings from her. she threatened to harm my family if i got them involved and when i tried to tell the school security, she went to the guidance and reported that i had depression (when i didnt) and she pretended to be worried about me and as a result the school didn't take me seriously. this went on for about two years before a guy that i am friends with and a group of ghetto kids i would tutor/help pass the class beat her up and got me out of this. right after this, my mental and physical health, family relationships, outlook on life and everything got better. people like her scare me for what toxic relationships others might be stuck in and i pray that my kids never deal with this."
39,It's by Jay Shetty. I highly recommend his YouTube videos if you're getting out of a relationship
40,Yes I do

48,"I would discuss the importance of revamping our educational system. How we teach young children the importance of hands on learning but then they sit in classes as they are older and work out of workbooks. They lose interest because the work is boring and they aren't stimulated enough. All classes would be concrete with hands on learning. They would learn through project based lessons and be able to learn at a pace that doesn't put pressure on them to succeed. They also would do group assignments that foster working with other students and how everyone has a role. Field trips and guest speakers would come into the classrooms and help them learn about each lesson. 
This of course is if we had more budget."

57,"Golden Hour, Kacey Musgraves"
58,"Never. After a wash I towel and air dry. It takes hours but I dont mind since I shower in the evening. I have long, thick, naturally wavy hair, but I brush it straight and it tends to stay that way unless its humid.

After I dye it (I use semi-permenant stuff every few months or so) I blow dry it, but that's it."

61,"The weekend I got engaged she started dating a new guy from out of town. We made plans the following weekend to hang out, I told her that if she wanted to hang with new guy just let me know and I‚Äôll stay home. She assured me she wanted to get together. Day of she doesn‚Äôt answer my calls/texts for hours. Eventually tells me new guy surprised her and they have been out shopping but she wanted me to meet him so we could all meet for dinner and she‚Äôll call me later to tell me when and where. That was 3 years ago and I literally have not heard from her since. Nothing. Completely ghosted. We had been best friends for over 10 years. I had checked her roommate‚Äôs Snapchat that night and they were out drinking and partying so it‚Äôs not like anything bad happened to her. It was after that that I began to realize that over the previous number of years she never invited me to anything and would always ditch out on anything I invited her to.

74,"I had a best friend in high school. To this day she was the longest lasting female friendship I had. Knew her almost all of my HS career. 

In retrospect we weren't really best friends but we were both the closest friends we had. Even she couldn't stand me, lol.  But we we both were outcasts in a cliquey school. I really loved her and her company even though I sucked at showing it, and knowing how I was as a teenager I don't blame her for wanting to sever contact

One summer she stopped replying to my texts. I messaged her on Facebook, nothing. When I asked her about it on the first day of school, she said gave me a BS answer lol.
 

We had short exchanges and when high school was over we never spoke after that. Sometimes I still check her social media lol whats wrong with me? Sometimes I think about messaging her and rekindling but 1) I don't want to make her uncomfortable or feel obligated and 2) I am in the same position in life I was in when I was 17 and she has an office job, tons of friends, and has a life lol."
75,"You aren't a toxic monogamist if these are your only worries. If you're in a committed relationship with this person (or trying to be), it sounds like your hesitation is valid and you should try to move on. It sounds like this person can't manage their emotions or relationships appropriately and, aside from the potential for you to be screwed over, this is a huge red flag in itself. Just leave man, stop wasting time. Any further time wasted in this relationship is really just time you could be spending on actually moving on and looking for someone else."
76,At first I thought you meant there was a product out there made to scratch your genitals and let me tell you I was confused
77,"Tights- scratchy. 
Pantyhose-a pain to get on, often get runs, a bit scratchy but not terrible.
Leggings--amazing. Comfortable. I wear them to bed. They're super soft."

79,Yes! So nice to see this!
80,"I have beautiful soft curly hair because I don‚Äôt ever use heat. The trick is to wash it less (every 2 days), shampoo probably 1-2 times a week and condition it more than you shampoo your hair basically


I use coconut herbal essences conditioner. You won‚Äôt regret using it, amazing product. Your hair will be so soft after the first use. As a person with curls, it worked wonders for me. Lots of people started complimenting my hair after I started using it and still do

 I also let my hair naturally dry and it forms into perfect curls. Blow drying it makes it puffy and damages your hair"

103,That's a good point. I've told him that I feel like we have an expiration date bc it just seems like I'm always putting the effort in to keep us afloat and now I'm just tired. I'm not even mad anymore. It's messy and our relationship is rocky at the moment.
104,"I kind of just eyeball it these days but I have a 32oz spray bottle. Id say 28oz vinegar and 4oz dish liquid. Dawn is preferred but whatever you have works fine! Adjust the ratios to your liking. Add more dish liquid if you want more foaming action. 

That said, the first time I followed an original recipe where it was 1:1 and I do not recommend it for cleaning large surfaces because you'll be rinsing FOR DAYS lol, especially since Dawn is so damn concentrated."
105,"I know he's seen it all it's just the fact that we've hung out outside of the tattoo situation. That said he is very respectful and has asked plenty of times if I'd rather he get somebody else to do it, but I think he would do the style best. Droop sisters - that works, I'll probably wear a spots bra then. None of the tattoo is actually on the boob flesh so we should be good. And yours is still visible even if your boobs are out and you're standing normally? That's reassuring. Although most of the people who see it will probably be my friends seeing it while I have a bra on, so I'm not that worried"
106,do you still love them when they arent giving you attention?
107,"When you don't have their attention are you thinking about them, missing them, or just thinking about where else you could get attention?

When they're feeling down, sad, or stressed do you want to help and make them feel better or are you just going through the motions until they're focused on you again?

Infatuation, lust, and attention-seeking are selfish feelings, focused on you. Love isn't selfish, love is wanting a partnership, and wanting the best for your person even when it means sacrifices on your part."
108,"When I've said a need a few times, like affection outside of sex, and still am not getting it.

Like I feel like a needy idiot for asking for hugs and kisses.

So now I've stopped."
109,"I fell off a horse onto a cattle grid then the horse fell on me, tried to get up and fell on me twice more. I felt my bones break. Funny thing is that I must have been half conscious but I remember everything going lime green for some reason."
110,Nope just slosh it around in the bottle until the dish liquid is dissolved :)
111,I just bought that last night.  Do you use it for the shower?
112,"No, it's not. Because you aren't his mother, and he has to be adult enough to do that. If they've done things so egregious that you have cut them off entirely, it's not realistic to avoid them the rest of your lives together unless both of you do, and he has no interest in doing that. It means he doesn't actually understand why you did that, and still chooses them, or rather, himself, over you in the long run. 

It starts with small stuff, but if you already have issues with his parents, it WILL become bigger and bigger the longer you are together.  When there is unresolved dysfunction in a family, you marry the ENTIRE ball of dysfunction unless it's resolved."
113,As long as he is aware I'm sure he'll make it comfortable for you. Yes mine is noticeable when I stand straight. You can kinda see the top I have cleavage but I love having my little secret. That's why he had me stand normal so it could be placed right. I think it's my fav tattoo. Pain sucks but I would do it again. And sports bras were a savior during the healing

117,"Happened this year., she ghosted me the day before my 21st birthday. She started to talk and hang out with this girl a lot more lately which made me feel fomo so I told her that and how petty it was of me, but we planned on going out to celebrate my birthday once I was on spring break (I'm in school she isn't). I remember her saying how she didn't like this girl and how she would come visit unannounced or just come over to do her hair/makeup. The last text I got from my friend was something a long the lines of ""I don't wanna do this right before your birthday."" Didn't get a happy birthday message or anything.

A week goes by and still nothing so I unadd her on some social media. That resulted in me being blocked on everything. I sent her one last text apologizing that I didn't mean to take it this far and so on. No reply and it's been four months so safe to assume we are not best friends anymore."
118,"I'd stop visiting this friend at home, and avoid seeing her at all in potential company of her sister."

130,"once every three or four months. i got comfy with less-styled hair, and as a result my hair is healthy enough to bleach and dye blue as often as i want"
131,"I posted this to a similar question a little while ago, but I think it's relevant here.

I constantly check in with myself, my support system, and my partner.

I am often comparing myself in my relationship to my single self: am I as happy? Do I still do the things *I* want to do? How am I spending my time? What have I given up to accomodate the time and effort put into my relationship? Am I okay with those sacrifices? Have I completely let go of certain hobbies or aspects of myself? Am I okay with that? How has my mindset changed about the rest of my life due to influences from my partner?

I make sure my friends and family meet my partner and mesh well enough. I also check in with friends one on one to get truthful answers. My support system is honest and open with me because I am with them and there have been times when they say ""he's got the mindset of a highschool boy about sex"" (which shattered the glass on a potential partner and made me rethink things) or ""you haven't seen us in 3 months, I get this is new but comm'on man"" (which pointed out that I wasn't keeping a healthy balance with that new partner). My best friend put it very well once: whoever is in the relationship has their judgement compromised due to feelings, so friends step in with their judgement to make sure those feelings aren't blinding us to red flags.

Finally I check in with my partner: when something bugs me I mention it. I don't sweep my issues under the rug despite that being my main tactic in my last relationship (spoiler: 7 years of unmet needs can't fit under the rug). I always try to use these talks to open the discussion to everything about our relationship so that he can mention things that he might be holding back on too. We are both people-pleasers who have natural tendencies to martyr ourselves for our relationships, knowing that- I combat it with efforts to bring out any negative feelings early so we can manage them together.

Listen, being in any bad relationship for long trains you into toxic behavior and mindsets. It takes active thought and energy to untrain yourself and I'll be doing this ""proper training"" for the rest of my life I think, but it is so worth it to have a healthy and happy relationship. If you're not willing to do the work to untrain yourself out of your own toxicity then you have no business partaking in partnership."
132,"Red stripe, pbr, or natty boh."
133,Good choices!
134,"I was 20. And it didn't happen frequently afterward, not for years. By 25, I was finally able to come pretty easily and regularly with partners. Some of it was getting partners who'd listen, some of it was changing how I masturbated so that my body would ""know how"" to come with a partner."
135,I do the same but with a strong mousse

137,I drink.

140,"Well, I'm a woman and I play mostly RPGs. Fallout, The Witcher, Elder Scrolls series, Monster Hunter, Quantum Dream games. I like open world, or deep story games."
141,"You stop dating for at least half of the time period that you were in that relationship. If you were in an abusive relationship for 1yr, take at least 6mo where you go on zero dates and focus on your recovery, you friends, your family, your health, and your job. 

If you were in a super long relationship, like 20yrs, you don't need to take 10yrs off, but take at least a year to really focus on your life outside of romantic relationships."
142,"I moved to another country. 

Social media is a miracle in cases like this but we both have families now and it's been 7 years. We miss each other and still chat once in a while but life drives you apart unfortunately. Planning on moving back to my country for a year with hubby and daughter and can't wait for evening walks with her and her son."

145,When they give you cute Nick names like who are you how did you get in my house dont touch me ow that hurts please stop shes just so silly
146,"I also enjoy that my boyfriend texts me multiple times a day every day. Even if it's just a quick ""I love you"" before he gets back to work"
147,Overheard her talking about me in the bathroom in grade 8.
148,"yeah you need to just leave him then. I've been involved with a narcissist, this won't change. I mean a real true, disordered narcissist. It will not get better, and if it hasn't already started will certainly lead to abuse."
149,"Best friend for 14 years, as soon as I got engaged it's like she made the decision I was no longer to be an important part of her life. We had been completely fine before that (we've been close forever) and as soon as I texted her the news, it's like she decided to become completely indifferent to it and to me. She barely responded. Despite that I kept making an effort, I told her it would make me the happiest person ever if she was to be at my wedding, I offered to switch around the dates (if that was the issue), but she just didn't care. I thought I'd give up after that, but I invited her to my bridal shower (as a sort of last attempt) and she completely ghosted. 

I went through the whole thing without her, and we haven't spoken since. I don't understand how you can throw away that many years of friendship for nothing. It's heartbreaking"
150,"I have thickish hair and I have a lot of it. Like an obscene amount apparently because I have to let hair stylists know when I book appointments because I take longer than people with a normal amount of hair. Right now it's long. It's wavy if I let it air dry.

Right now because it's summer and hot as fuck I'm not using any heat because I don't need to make myself sweat more. I usually just put it in braids to dry and then it's wavy/curly and it's cute."
151,And hows it all turning out? I'm so sorry to hear about your dog x
152,"Autonomy (remastered) by Perspective, a Lovely Hand to Hold

A friend played it on repeat the summer that I got to know him, and got involved with him haha. It was a really great time in my life, and that album was very different from what I usually listen to. It just left a very strong impression, when I hear it I just get taken back to that time and those feelings I had at that time."
153,"Insecure how? Financially? Emotionally? About their height or size of their dick? 

Are you saying women are insecure? I have so many questions."
154,"You say: NEXT! A failed situation is  making room for your true love, (someeone deserving of your love, a.k.a someone who can actually recognize how precious your love is) to come and fill their rightful position. 

Giving your heart is a privilege that only certain candidates will experience and with each candidate, you'll learn, and it'll help you streamline the admission process until you find the true and  ideal one, who is meant to have that position; one who is qualified to recognize it's value, and the only movement for you both is upward and higher, promoting each other to the great level of love, commitment, trust, peace, sacrifice, and all the true greatness of true love. 

Every disappoint is a blessing.  You pick which perspective you want to lead you! Because your thoughts become actions, actions become character, and character makes destiny. üòä"

161,"I pack way more than I need and still don't have anything to wear. Or, I forget a key component of my outfit...like matching shoes."
162,I finally found myself after moving out of my parents house. Didn't realize it till it hit me that my life is turning out far better than I could ever imagined it would
163,I tend to ramble and not make sense of what I'm trying to express. My partner is always trying to get to the root of what I'm trying to say. I tend to drift off mumble something &amp; move on. He gets so frustrated but I finally had an light bulb moment when he said he is genuinely trying to figure out what I'm saying or perhaps what he said that I misinterpreted so theres better communication. All my life if I didnt say things accurately I was criticized so I assumed hed do the same. As a result Id never explain but he has good intentions as is ultimately just trying to understand my perspective.

Can't know how to pack without that information, aside from the basics which is always packing 3 more pairs of socks and underwear than I think I'll need, plus toiletries and such. 

I use a suitcase + my regular handbag"
166,"LMAO I'm like this too!! So for me, it helps to compare how I felt around other people. When I just like the attention, it doesn't really matter where that attention is coming from. I like you because you're the one giving me that attention, but if you weren't around, it wouldn't be that big a deal as long as someone else was around to step up and take your place. 

When I like YOU, it doesn't really matter who else is around or how much attention other people are/aren't giving me, I want YOU to notice me"
167,"I don't really care for wearing perfume based on season. I like Flowerbomb and Philosophy Nude Grace, year-round."
168,I think so. And it doesn‚Äôt put too fine a point on it. I‚Äôm open to a variety of ways that might play out.
169,He would don‚Äôt worry! Enjoy the roller coaster of feelings you have now and move on when you are ready! Later on you will realize ah that‚Äôs why this doesn‚Äôt work out! You will be grateful that you dodge a bullet. Even though he might be nice but he might not be the best person for you!

172,"Take a step back from the bigger picture, and focus on grinding through life day to day. I also like to think of things I've accomplished rather than places I failed. Sure, it's a lot harder than it sounds, but it's what I do when I feel depressed or unhappy with where I am."

183,"Me and my best Friend (we slept together for about 4/5 months) she has a BF now) always seem to fight over the smallest things and when we do start talking about our feelings we always think the person venting them self out is trying to start an argument. 
I have no idea why this happens or why we do it, it happened before we slept together and we blamed it on caring so much about each other.
I want to say there's still something relationship wise, but that's more down to I want there to be something"
184,Very sensitive sense of smell!  I walked into a GameStop and had to run out from the overwhelming smell of teenage boy!
185,I don't think about it
186,"Sore boobs were the first clue, they don‚Äôt get sore during my period. Then food aversions, I wasn‚Äôt nauseous but everything was disgusting to me. Then bone deep, all-consuming exhaustion.

187,"Not important enough to make a decision based on it.

It's more of an interesting factoid"
188,"Most of them, if not all.  I feel like they all have their place and positive applications.

For example, social media gets a bad rap for many good reasons, but it's a fantastic way to keep in touch with people you would otherwise lose contact with.  Along those same lines: carrying around decent cameras in our mobile devices.  Some people overdo it, but it's amazing we're able to catalog so much about our lives, from our specific appearance one day to once-in-a-lifetime events."
189,"Probably not the kind of intimate you were going for, but...

Sharing fears and anxieties, being completely vulnerable with the other person."
190,"Yes. You broke the rules, you get called on it. 


Follow them or don‚Äôt post here."
191,"Didn't really have a honeymoon, just a vacation a few months after we got married.  I don't recall how much sex we had on that trip.  We average once per day on vacations with a day or two off throughout."
192,"My ex came out as gay after 5 years. 

That took a minute to sink in. Relationship was great and he doesnt hate me and we are still good friends but it definitely sucks. Its given me freedom to come and go as I please and allowed me to learn some things about myself. I dont find it embarrassing because it is what it is. I'm just grateful we didn't get married before he figured things out. 

People would probably say I should be embarrassed but I cant change things I can't control and there is no reason to get bent out of shape over it."
193,"Bold enough to be shamed for? 

A sentence can be reconfigured to fit someone‚Äôs story. Just as men follow askwomen and can share their story and change up the pronoun to fit their life. Whether it‚Äôs man finds the one with man or woman to woman."

200,Leave. No one is worth putting up with that.
201,"When you describe them to others, what words do you use? 

Are the descriptions about what they do for you (good listener, thoughtful, good cook) or are they descriptions of characteristics that don‚Äôt benefit you (creative, intelligent, hardworking)?"
202,"Corona with lime baby 

Or a pbr"
203,"Tights aren't gender specific in the way that our underwear and bras are, and the only meaningful difference between pantyhose and tights is the hose has the gusset so we don't have to wear underwear under them.

By all means your welcome to try them."
204,"I was in my early 30's. We'd been together 10 years. He went down on me unexpectedly. He'd tried to do that when we first started dating and I'd stopped him because it was uncomfortable. Those first 10 years, taking care of myself while he ""helped"" was part of our foreplay. After that, oral happened almost every time. Game changer."
205,"When you're willing to make sacrifices just to make their life a little bit better, that's when you love them."

207,"Son of a bitch slept w my gf, gave me an std"
208,"Star Trek, because I can already talk about it for hours if I get the chance, so one hour is a walk in the park"
209,I was ravenously hungry all the time. I could eat a massive meal and be absolutely starving an hour later. I was insatiable. I was also exhausted all the time.
210,Mine is similar. I rarely blow dry and once in a blue moon use a flat iron (to deal with frizz or a dress up thing). Curls never last and def feel you on styles. Keratin treatments and similar things sound nice in theory for flyaways but don't have the volume of hair for it. Oh well. Have changed some products and am growing it out again; we'll see.
211,I don‚Äôt think I know this song.
212,"Sometimes things turn out better than you realized. Imagine if you had that life you wish you had. Knowing what you know now, how has your current life been affected. For example, if you didn‚Äôt land your dream job but you found a different job, it‚Äôs possible you met one of your closest friends there, which wouldn‚Äôt have happened if you got your dream job"
213,Miller Lite now and forever
214,It becomes more about them and less about you.
215,Me neither! I put all the remixes as well
216,Anything by John Gottman.
217,"Exactly! I hope you can find happy companionship after this, whether it be near or far! This internet stranger is rooting for you :) And I hope you realize the good that can come of putting your all into love."
218,23 - is that normal or late? I was 18 when I first started having sex with this partner but after we got married and moved in together I guess we have had more time to make sex even better.
219,"Planning a future ahead that includes some aspects of what I wasn't able to do before, but at the same time concentrating on something new. Get a new dream and follow it."
220,I think there is a reason it's popular with children
221,"Pregnancy #1: sore boobs that lasted longer than a week, then ravenous hunger

Pregnancy #2: ravenous hunger, then feeling tired and needing a nap every afternoon"
222,"BIGGEST FEAR. but. What id tell myself. Growth. It comes when your at your lowest. Or when you stop to take a break at the boulder on the hike. Get it? YOU ONLY GO UP. PROCCESSS. YOUR. EMOTIONS. Give your all everyday. Stop letting people prevent you from being fully happy. If anything you giving your all and them saying that you arent what they want. Means. LISTEN CAREFULLY YO. This isn't like any situation. Its love. Its lust. When they say you arent the one! YOU DID WELL JUST NOT FOR THAT PERSON. Guess what. You can trust other people. So  I WILL YELL THIS FOR THE BITCHES IN THE BACK. Dont not give your all. Someone one day will give it back. Thats their test to handle all of it vs just some shitty person tryna actually work for the same shit. 

Love you. And i hope you feel better"
223,"Flag things, check all emails, schedule time for myself to complete tasks, keep a to do list when anything out of my ordinary tasks comes up"
224,Oh my gosh this is me. I have a new partner and things are going great and I‚Äôm just SO worried about seeming perfect. I don‚Äôt want things to end and I know that if I let down my guard he wouldn‚Äôt stay around. Who would?
225,I'm curious how old he is and why he's dating someone 8 years younger. Is this the reason why he isn't dating someone closer to his age?
226,"Not important. I think blue eyes can be striking, but I like all colors."
227,Sometimes what you want isn‚Äôt what you need.
228,"I don't like the original. I LOVE the remix with just Billy Ray. The recent remix that came out with Young Thug and Mason Ramsey, I'm not totally into it, but the line ""if you ain't got no giddy up then giddy out my way"" is fantastic and I will love it forever."

230,"We go on 2 7 day trips a year one to the beach and one to either a city or a mountain location. I take a medium suitcase and a canvas overnight bag. The suitcase holds my clothes. Overnight bag holds shoes and hygiene bag. I also carry my purse. 

The canvas overnight bag then doubles as a bag to take to the beach, snack bag (I have 3 kids), holds everyone's jackets, etc. during the trip. 

Clothes are folded shirts are stacked together and bottoms are stacked together. Swimsuits and undergarments go in the netted area."
231,"Put it on my latest Spotify playlist, and I ain‚Äôt sorry bout that."
232,"I was 16, almost 17 years old (my first and only partner, still with him today)"
233,"Try not to feel bad that you feel. Feelings are important and help guide you to better clarity, in this case, the type of parnership you want. Acknowledge that feeling embarassed is you paying attention to your guidance system. The feeling will then naturally move on and you can get back to the matter at hand. Repeat as necessary. If you use it, your guidance system will keep working perfectly. Good luck!"
234,"Communicating them at all. My current partner has worn my trust down and made me feel like I'm crazy for having feelings at all. I can't tell you how many times I've heard ""But I'm a guy, we just can't help [thirsting after girls on Instagram]"" / ""I really don't think your feelings are valid"" / ""You're just overthinking things"" / ""You need to relax"" / ""I think you take your job too seriously [therefore I'm not sorry about telling other people work things that you told me to keep private]"". I pretty much don't tell him anything anymore and I have gotten pretty resentful."
235,What do you think of the fourth remix with RM from BTS?
236,"Waistlines.  As I was growing up, clothing was made to emphasize waistlines, and I still like seeing that."
237,"As much as possible, I ignore it and them.  Usually that's easy, because they don't approach me directly with it."
238,"You just do. Things are more different when you're older. The world doesn't seem so easy anymore. You mature more because the more you see the more you know. The jaded you feel. 

The ""once I want to be older"" mentality is way different, little girls want to grow up but don't know how the world works. Especially people who live in bubbles HAVE NO IDEA. *Reminder to self* let them be in their bubble. Do not attempt to burst."
239,"3 year anniversary of my dad‚Äôs death.  I still have a ton of anger towards his widow.  After my mom died (I‚Äôm more at peace losing her) he went crazy.  He hooked up with someone he knew from high school and moved 800 miles away.  He began being very short with us. Always rushing off the phone.  I ended up just very pissed at him for abandoning me so soon after my mom died.  

He suddenly died from complications from a surgery. Found out he gave some of my mom‚Äôs possessions to his wife. I was hurt.  I have so much guilt and depression over this. Finally talked to my psychiatrist about wanting therapy.  Here‚Äôs hoping I stick with it."

250,Tell myself that God has a different plan for me
251,[removed]
252,"I just have a different perspective. I don't want ""things"" or accomplishments necessarily. I want to be a person with good character. As long as that is who I am and I am trying my best I can sleep well at night. Everything else is a temporary  state and as long as you get up in the morning everything can be changed. Life is a journey."
253,"God did I. I overcame it by making sure that I had time for me and my interests. Same goes for my husband. We were excited to be parents, but we didn't want to JUST be parents. We are a relatively young couple with a ton of interests and hobbies and a big social circle. We didn't want to lose that, so we made sure we didn't. We still got together for D&amp;D every week. We found childcare when the new movies came out that we wanted to see. We have a bedtime firmly set for our child so that we get adequate amounts of time to ourselves to do what we want to do. My husband and I still stay caught up on the latest video games, movies, and TV shows (that one is harder). We still see our friends weekly. We manage to do this and still eat dinner as a family every night. It is hard, but we wanted to make sure our identities as individuals were protected first and foremost."
254,"I lose myself every now and then. I become too committed to my relationship sometimes that I forget to live or act for myself. 
The first thing is to just take in your settings and try to calm down if you are getting anxious. Don‚Äôt think of it as ‚Äúoh my god. Who am I. I‚Äôm not who I want to be. Oh my god.‚Äù Instead, think of it as ‚Äúokay. I‚Äôm lost obviously. But, now that I found out I‚Äôm going to take a journey to get back to who I really am‚Äù. 
What I usually do to get back to being me is by first just sitting down and calmly thinking about what it is that I think is different about me. If I lost myself, what did I lose? It could be something small or big. Just think of the specifics. After that I think about the things I used to do that made me feel the way I did. What am I doing now that‚Äôs different than what made me feel good back then? Think of them or write them down and if your past hobbies are no longer interesting to you, find new ones. The best thing I can recommend is try something old and try something new. 
And if it‚Äôs about an S/O, explain what‚Äôs going on. They should be there to support you, not bring you down. If you tell them, they should be okay with most (if not all) the points you make because they care about you because of who you are. When I told mine I needed more space and to remember what my hobbies are and do things for myself and on my own, they agreed that it would be a good thing to do and wished me luck. This doesn‚Äôt have to be the end of a relationship, just the transformation of one."
255,"Fatigue and stress are the most common reasons I‚Äôd turn down sex, so that would be the truth. Those and being sick. If this were happening frequently (and ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù is a subjective term), my partner and I would hopefully discuss ways to help alleviate said issues. If it were occasional I‚Äôd expect them to just understand, just as I do/would when the reverse occasionally occurs. We‚Äôre (he and I) humans, not sex dolls."
256,No
257,"I‚Äôm in my late 20s and at this point and have no qualms or anxieties about it. My sister got married at 25 and has two young daughters, so I get to enjoy my nieces. However, seeing her go through pregnancy and motherhood has only reaffirmed my choice. 

First off, the first pregnancy was a whole ordeal. She got preeclampsia which was scary, and then they ended up having to do emergency C-section the first time. So they strapped her down to a table while she was convulsing, did local anesthesia and then sliced her belly open while she was still awake and conscious so they could pull my niece out. My brother-in-law was in the room and almost fainted.

So she had to recover from major surgery while caring for a newborn and she quit her job to stay at home with her kids. Her body still hasn‚Äôt fully recovered from the two labors and she still gets very tired doing any physical activity.

She‚Äôs had a lot of trouble making friends because she‚Äôs always with the kids. She and her husband can‚Äôt travel or have a date night without a lot of hassle. Overseas destinations are pretty much off the table. No quiet evenings in anymore either. No Netflix or games after work. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE my niece and I can only imagine how much love my sister has for her kids and how that makes everything worth it. But I‚Äôm not ready to transition to that lifestyle yet. I want to be able to go to concerts, or music festivals, or out at night with friends. I want my quiet evenings in and trips abroad for a while longer."
258,I relate so deeply to this. I don't know how many times I've leaned into the bathroom counter only to come back with a wet spot on my shirt.
259,‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want a job with flexible hours for when you have kids?‚Äù

267,"Who's watching the kid(s)?

If my husband (the one who works) is at his job, our with friends, anywhere but home, he never ever gets asked this. 

If I even run to the store for milk and see someone I know, or if I visit friends/family without my toddler, everyone asks where he is."
268,Happy cake day!
269,No anything natural looking does not have that effect
270,"We were both super young and self-centered (we met in Junior high.) 

I think I idealized the friendship tbh and made it out to be more than it was. I struggled to keep connections growing up (a combination of social awkwardness and a lack of ambition during puberty made it hard for me to keep a conversation going) so when I became friends with her I really latched onto the friendship and tried everything I could to please her and hype her up so she wouldn‚Äôt get ‚Äúbored‚Äù of me. 

Thinking back on it now though, she doted on me (And vice versa) and we were inseparable for a good portion of our friendship but while I was overly open with her in a bid to never have any sort of misunderstanding (Cringe I know üò≠) she often would withhold things from me (small little things) that weren‚Äôt supposed to mean anything but ended up snowballing. 

There were a ton of warning signs on both of parts. I was becoming increasingly emotional at every slight against me on her part and she stopped talking to me about any serious subjects (relationships, health, family) or would lie instead of just telling me she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. She stopped inviting me out places and went with her other friends instead but would only hang out with me while at school etc. 

During our freshmen year of college I finally dropped her as a friend. 

She had asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday about two months in advance and I told her exactly what I wanted to do- to go and see my favorite artist in concert. On my birthday two months later she posted an Insta pic of herself with one of her friends AT said concert that she had never mentioned getting tickets to. 

She‚Äôd forgotten my birthday as well. 

It just made me realize that we weren‚Äôt in a place where our friendship made either of us happy. I feel bad for ghosting her because she tried to reach me quite a few times (which surprised me) but I always felt it was moreso the idea that she never figured I would end the friendship (she was very obviously my only close friend at the time while she had several other friends.)"
271,"It sure would be nice if that's how things worked. It would have saved me a lot of stress in my early 20s as I discovered that you go through toilet paper a lot faster when you're the one paying for it and what do you mean I can't play WoW for 10 hours a day anymore that's bullshit!

And then I bought a house last year and at 37 I feel like I'm entering a brand new stage of Adult. like I leveled up because now there's no landlord to call if something breaks. Now I have to call. I've learned how to do some very minor plumbing stuff though in the last year! So that's been cool."
272,She conspired with my husband to leave their spouses so they could be together.
273,If you‚Äôre paying god no.
274,"I'm 36 and I met my current best friends when I was 32-33! Friendships morph and change over time, but my core community has been around for four years or so. I'm so so grateful, because these are some of the best people I've ever met.  They accept me just as I am and love me for me. And I love them for them. It's beautiful."
275,[removed]
276,"Met my primary best friend at 16. We had a falling out for 2 years around 26-28 but became even better friends again. My second best friend I met when I was 26, worked together for years and our relationship really blossomed moreso after we stopped working together. There‚Äôs hope. I think it‚Äôs all circumstantial, then the ones that are really good stick around or find a way to persist beyond convenience."
277,"It's not important to me. Although I think having kids with someone with my eye color would be cool. Mine are hazel but mostly green, and I love all eye colors. Mostly green and hazel though."
278,"Let's Rock, mmh, i've been loving it. But i'm a huge fan of them anyways..
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, takes me places and i love being taken.
Atom Heart Mother will forever be my favorite trip away from reality, in a way."

283,"A guy I knew that worked at a bar I would go to regularly.  At the time just a friend. I was thinking one night stand let‚Äôs get this shit over with. ( I was 22).

(Turned out to be totally worth it and it was pretty much love at first sight, but we still joke about it occasionally.) We have yet to really find a middle ground, but tbh most things he does don't bother me the way they do when other people do them. And even when they do, I have never found it as easy to forgive anyone as I do him. But it does lowkey drive me insane that he is never anywhere on time."

291,"I notice I poop more during my period. It doesn‚Äôt really feel different it‚Äôs just more stuff to clean up down there.  Blood, piss, shit... it‚Äôs a bit of a pain in the ass cleaning yourself up.  You feel yucky, want to keep taking a shower."
292,"Usually weekly. My hair hair is naturally curly and I have always hated it.  I‚Äôve been straightening it regularly since I was 17 and I‚Äôm 31 now. 

In the summer less because there‚Äôs no point in straightening it the heat and humidity will just curl it back up as soon as I go outside.  So most of the time I‚Äôm just wearing it in a bun.  I protect it as best I can but it‚Äôs definitely damaged. Thinned out a lot and doesn‚Äôt grow past a certain length.  

I always wanted to just be able to wash my hair or get it wet and let it dry straight and long.    But no that‚Äôll never happen."
293,"I think it‚Äôs stupid.  It‚Äôs always been the 31st and people have found ways to make it work as far as their parents have to rush, ‚Äútoo stressful‚Äù reasoning.   They also want to make it during the day which I think is dumb because it takes away the spookiness &amp; scary fun of it. 
I think they‚Äôre being way too uptight about it.  

Unfortunately though not many people seem to be as enthusiastic about Halloween anymore and do close up earlier and earlier. With less and less people participating.  It‚Äôs sad to me I love Halloween it‚Äôs always been my favorite holiday.  When I was a kid the streets were full of kids, almost every house giving... you could fill bag after bag up.   It‚Äôs so not the same anymore."
294,"The first year or two of the baby vortex can fuck you up. You are in survival mode. Once you get your groove back, take time to care for yourself and listen to loud music in the car with f words on your way to do something alone.  When your kid(s) are able to go to school, especially full day elementary, you are living life instead of surviving. Also, something happens at some point where you become entirely confident in your ability to parent and you no longer compare or explain yourself to others."
295,"Love is when you see something funny and immediately want to tell them. Love is when you smile when you think of them. Love is when you fight with each other but still make up because you love each other.

Loving attention is when you don‚Äôt *really* care what they‚Äôre up to. You just ask because you‚Äôre supposed to, not because you genuinely care. When you can‚Äôt be bothered having to listen to them whine. When you wouldn‚Äôt be there for them on their bad days."
296,"I had a few different episodes of what I call ""spiraling,"" like uncontrollable crying for hours into the night. It had nothing to do with my fiance, but nothing he said or did helped. After a few episodes of that over the span of a couple of weeks, and realizing how lonely and unhappy I felt, I realized I really needed help."
297,The anxious attachment style can lead a smart person to believe someone could be more than they are. Learning to not love someone for who we think they could be but for who they really are is really difficult. It‚Äôs easy to look back in hindsight and see those realities are wildly different but to preempt it is a skill.
298,Yep. This exactly.

304,"I had to accept that I was a big reason why my life didn't turn out how I wanted to.

314,"When we broke up and he told me that he only tolerated many of my personality traits and truly saw the absolute worst in me. Automatically assumed I did things for malicious reasons rather than by accident/unknowingly for years without ever talking to me about it. Hard to learn that someone you love and thought loved you actually thought you were an ugly person.

Right now we're still talking, but it's hard to be friends with someone who only looks for the bad in you (and makes some up) and has for years. 

Sorry for venting!!"

324,"Middle school was really bad.  I went through a lot... death of a loved one, struggled with severe emotional and mental problems. Was expelled from 2 schools.  Going to a total of 4 in 3 years.. bad times.   Never did go to highschool but I can just imagine how horrible that would have been given my mental state, home life and school I would have been attending."
325,"He eats like a slob. He used to lick plates when he was done with them (thankfully that seems to have stopped) and when he eats he just makes a mess all over his mouth and clothes. It's off putting. He says it's because he has a small mouth, but I think he just needs to take smaller bites and slow down.

Other than that, he's great!"
326,Bold of you to assume I have one.
327,"I have been in two long distance relationships. The first one was with someone who didn't think we would ever meet up (and never bothered to tell me that), so we were stuck from the beginning. I was more of a giver and he was more of a taker and it never evolved past that. I was really inexperienced in relationships at that point, but I like what I learned from it because it helped me with my second long distance relationship.

My current situation turned out great. I met my husband on reddit and we just didn't stop talking. It was a long two years of us being long distance with only two visits, but now he is sleeping next to me, snoring, right now. It worked out. We broke up once (to answer the question) because the distance sucked, but we got back together. I am so glad we did."
328,By knowing that it may not have turned out how I wanted and unexpected things may have happened but the options for what it can be are endless and lead me to figure out what I want and to take little steps and focus on one thing at a time to get to where I want it to be.

I have a few days in September where I will take a self holiday to get my shit together.  I rarely get alone time and so much has changed,  I can't keep up and feel pretty lost. I can't even fit in therapy, but I like the idea of journaling.  That I can do at night when the kids are asleep and I can have that little time before I have to sleep and get up so damn early to start all over again."

335,"My best friend of 3 years was absolutely phenomenal, she let me vent about my husband and children, she was always there when I needed help and even ordered pizza delivery for me often so I could catch a break -she was seriously the best and I tried to return the favor when I could by making her things she used for her psoriasis, researching natural things to help with that and her other health conditions and she always appreciated that and my children loved her and she was also close to my husband and was a great female friend to him   


Then... she found a guy who was interested in her and I had some reservations about him because of some home issues and I expressed my concerns but also really wanted to meet him to see him for myself because you can only learn so much about someone online and our first online experience was bad (I asked if he would like to borrow a book about toxic parents as my bestie had an extremely toxic mother) and he responded with ""F you... it's not your place to offer books to me"" -a huge red flag but thats why I wanted to see him in person so he could not hide behind the computer   


Well, everytime I was in the area (two hours from me) they always had an excuse as to why we can't meet... then bestie blows off my husband when he asked if she wanted to come celebrate his birthday with us and she said sure... she will let us know when we can pick her up and there was never a response, so the husband asked her what happened and she acted like she never got the message and I did not know this had all happened so I was hearing two different stories until husband showed me the screenshot of the conversation   


So I confronted her, basically telling her she and my husband need to sit and talk this out and I really miss spending time with her - she responded by blocking me and ghosting me on all social media and blocking my phone and when I asked our mutual friend what happened, I was told ""You need to ask people permission before you say things like that""   


I was crushed, hurt, embarrassed and I just can't understand why this happened

He's asking me for sex every damn day. It's never happened, so why would you think it's going to start?

He's being a cranky a-hole, then expecting me to want to have sex with him. 

He's picking apart my sexual enthusiasm."
338,"I‚Äôm not even sure I finished the book in high school (which was like 7 years ago for me), but this quote has stood the rest of time in my memory because I find it simple yet profound. It hints at the harsh realities of sexism in our world.

Honestly, as a child, more often told I was smart than pretty, I often longed to be prettier instead of smarter (or smart at all). As a woman, I sometimes still feel this way if I‚Äôm being real.

365,Oh wow. May I ask why not? All I own is mascara. I used to own more but I just don't like using it.

368,"the 19m perspective says balancing emotional responses with my 19f girlfriend. We both have a slew of mental health issues, and we both have a hard time bringing them up, me especially, for fear of exacerbating the other‚Äôs bad habits/ issues. I find it especially hard because, although we have different and non equatable conditions, and although mine are not inherently worse or easier than hers, I always fear telling her my issues. I always feel like its not that bad, or not as bad as hers, simultaneously knowing she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that bad entirely due to the fact I don‚Äôt share what is happening too often. There is a lot of nuance to this question and my answer, and I apologize if my comment doesn‚Äôt make a whole lotta sense. I‚Äôm kinda rambly, I know."
369,"I encourage them to do independent reading/art projects or have them race each other in the yard, or take them to the park. Sometimes it even helps for them to have a friend over so they can self entertain. Mine are 6 &amp; 2, it doesn't always work for very long, but sometimes that's enough to just keep them from being in my space for a few minutes.

Option 2 is the ever popular lock yourself in the bathroom a few minutes. 

Option 3: tv/ipad. just a little while. I'd rather they had an extra 15 minutes of screentime than see me lose my shit."

Here‚Äôs how I would rate them from worst to least pain:

1. Stomach Flu
2. Ectopic pregnancy (I had pain on one side from the ectopic PLUS constipation)
3. The constipation you just described
4. Appendicitis 
5. Birth
6. Gallstones 
7. Surgery"
372,"I think I‚Äôm technically an extroverted introvert, so not sure if I qualify. We only have one child and we all kind of do our own thing for a lot of the time. I‚Äôd say my husband is an introvert and my son is probably an introvert as well, so this works okay for us. Sometimes I feel like a crappy mom
because I‚Äôm not totally involved with whatever my son is doing, but I think I make up for it in other ways.

I also struggle with the touching, because I just don‚Äôt like to be touched, snuggled, cuddled, etc. I need my space, and I get hot and antsy if someone is too close for too long. I worry that my son will grow up and feel that I wasn‚Äôt affectionate, so I make a point of giving hugs when I can. He‚Äôs definitely more of a cuddler than I am, so that‚Äôs a bigger struggle.

Interestingly (and hopefully unrelated, but maybe not), he‚Äôs recently started seeing a therapist for anxiety and she also diagnosed him with an attachment disorder. Basically, he gets really anxious if he has to be away from me for an extended period of time, or can‚Äôt be close to me when he wants to be (bedtime, for example). Now I‚Äôm wondering if it has anything to do with my lower level of affectionate..."

374,"TW: Suicide

When I realized I hadn't really felt much of anything for a while and had started thinking of continuing to live in an antagonistic way.

Suicidal ideation doesn't have to start with a plan and a letter.

Mine started with me thinking things like ""Man it'd be nice if someone just plowed into me in a t-bone. Hope they'd be okay, though."" 

It just kind of progressed from there.

It's important to seek help before you ever get to this point. I was *getting therapy* when I attempted suicide.

A friend of mine said something very wise recently: ""There are 8 Billion people on Earth, and every damn last one of them needs therapy.""

If you have to ask a question like ""When did you realize you needed to actually go therapy?"" you probably need to go to therapy, dear one."

380,"If you have 'thunder thighs', (like me), it's already annoying that your thighs are rubbing you don't want anything scraping and chaffing, and occasionally tearing the nylons with all the friction.

Just carry a small bottle of light powder and when you are alone and feeling uncomfortable, put a little on. If you have a reasonable manager, if you are the manager, no one should blame you for a quick stop to the restroom."

And it didn‚Äôt get better right away, it actually got harder. Between complications from my surgery, stresses from work, and unexpectedly losing my dog, it was one of the worst years of my life. 

I got through it by taking things one day at a time. My health gradually got better. I and everyone around me finally saw the changes I‚Äôd worked so hard to achieve come through. Through that, I gained so much of my confidence back. I relearned my worthiness."

i had to break it off w my gf a few days back bc of distance (as far as i know we got along very well in person but the distance just kinda got too heavy given the fact that we only had about a month in person prior to that. :/

But also I think you start turning it down if things aren‚Äôt okay in the relationship. You aren‚Äôt feeling appreciated, wanted, or special. When you have sex it can be a really vulnerable moment and many don‚Äôt want to be vulnerable to someone who isn‚Äôt making them feel ‚Äúxyz‚Äù.

422,"My hair is very straight, low maintenance type of hair.  It's not thick but its not super thin either.  All I do is wash, condition, brush and air dry on a regular basis. Maybe some dry shampoo here and there.  This is what I do:

1. Day old hair.  Dirty hair always holds curl better.  If you wash it the same day, chances are it's not going to curl so if I know I'm curling my hair, I throw it up in a bun while I shower so it won't get wet.
2. Get good hairspray.  My go-to is the Extra hold Big Sexy Hair hairspray.  Spray all your hair first and brush through it before anything.
3. You need a hot curling iron.  I have a hot tools curling iron and turn the setting at about 8 and that is seriously hot.  Some women don't realize that their curling irons don't get hot enough to curl their hair.
4. Don't use hair chunks that are too large or it won't hold the curl as the heat won't get through to all the hairs.  
5. Hold the iron in your hair for 8-10 seconds
6. Spray your entire head with hairspray again before pulling the curls out.

* Extra tip: If you really want it to hold longer, clip each curl to your head right after curling and let it hold while you do other things before pulling all the clips out and styling."
423,"I have no idea who she is. I looked her up for this question and she looks... fine? I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs even in the top 1,000 most attractive people I‚Äôve seen on Instagram."
424,"This is great advice, thank you. I think I have to work on just being fine, like you. I will focus on my own life instead of investing so much energy and thought into hers."
425,"I just started answering it with stupid replies like, ""I have a kid?!"" followed by looking around frantically like I lost him üòÇ"
426,"My best friend's partner does this, calling her mummy when not talking to the baby. It makes me nauseous."
427,"A conversation I had with my best friend a couple years back about this person he was pursuing sparked up this question I had. 

If you met me when you finally decided to try and settle down with someone, would you have given me a chance?"
428,you dive head-first into an ultimately abusive and bad relationship before realizing that you‚Äôre better off as friends.
429,"&gt; the only advice i can offer here is look for signs that they aren‚Äôt interested anymore so you can leave before you get your own feelings hurt. if you‚Äôre putting in 100% of the effort, that‚Äôs not a real relationship. if they aren‚Äôt putting in their 50%, you reap no rewards.

I actually did leave. I broke up with him. It still hurt because I still loved him, but I knew he wasn't into me anymore so I stood up for myself and broke up with him. I still have those negative feelings of ""what if I did this or that"" but I suppose that's normal"
430,Noted it as tips for my future style search :)
431,"Haha you sound like me... endlessly tired, late, and unskilled at makeup."
432,No idea who that is.  Googled her and she's not really my type physically.
433,"Not much; genetically wise, blue eyes and dimples - personality wise, we both love animals. We were never very close to be honest."
434,Gratitude for what I have and a sense of curiosity for what might come.
435,"For sure. I think we really need to push back against it, particularly as it makes zero sense. Like, take Amal Clooney, to use one super obvious example. Her gorgeousness in no way diminishes the important work she does as a hotshot international human rights lawyer, and vice versa. I genuinely don't see how people can look around the world where there are so many beautiful women accomplishing so many awesome things and still hold onto the belief that you have to choose: either pretty *or* smart."
436,I had to look her up because I'd never heard of her.  She looks like a normal pretty lady but not at all my type.
437,Wow! Not even for special occasions?
438,I was really wondering why hes taking a horse to his hotel room.
439,u/Zukosmum made a beautiful poem from this! You should read it
440,"I felt so lost in life. I was starting grad school and I knew I wanted that but otherwise I was like wtf is going on, 20s are an odd time. I‚Äôve been in a ‚Äúhard place‚Äù for a few years but I don‚Äôt feel as lost as I did. I can‚Äôt explain the feelings but it wasn‚Äôt the typical ‚Äúwhat am I going to do with my life‚Äù it was something different.

Another time I was dealing with anxiety, I was very insecure due to a previous terrible relationship and was bringing those issues into my current one"

442,"&gt;My son is my life, but not my life purpose.

You hit the nail on the head right here.  

I have a co-worker whose identity is solely being a mom and considers her 4 year old her best friend."
443,"Internally: 0
Pressure from society: I don't give a crap, so 0"
444,Not really..
445,"No, I'm straight..."
446,You‚Äôre not dead. Move forward. You got this!!
447,"I never had it internally, and was lucky that there was hardly any pressure from other people.

I'm now 42 years old, and it's no longer any kind of issue."
448,"Our hair color, and our driving temperment"
449,Had to google her - very pretty. But trying to be the most beautiful Instagram star is a losing game for all the participants.
450,"Sudden anger outburst (I am never angry, NEVER), crying for no reason, having really dark thoughts about harming myself and why i should be alive..."
451,"We've been married 4 years. We've just been growing apart, and I have thought about it a lot. My partner asked that we give it another real shot, but the feelings aren't coming back like they should if this is gonna work."
452,Ignore 'em. It hurts their ego and I love it
453,"Sometimes I don't. Sometimes I'm really bitter about it, but most of the time I'm reasonably content. I'm over 50 and I know the world is still my oyster, but frankly I really don't know what I want now that the life I thought I was going to have didn't materialize.  

Until I figure that out, I try to maintain an even keel and to change the sheets on my bed more often than I actually do."
454,What are shampoo brushes and Korean scrubby towels?
455,"I'd say my drive to have kids is a 7 out of 10 or so. I do want kids, I think, as much as you can want something that is  terrible for you physically, mentally, and financially in a lot of ways anyway. I don't feel much pressure from society though. Our attitude is we'll start trying (or rather not actively not trying haha) next year. if it happens, great, if not then we just get a bunch of free time and money."

457,"Rock climbing is our big one. We go on a lot of weekend and day trips.

We're also both vegan and he sometimes comes to volunteer at the farm animal sanctuary with me.

We also both enjoy music, but he's a (fantastic) musician and I just listen."
