0,"This is more after the date, but he didn't play any mind games and texted me that same night saying he had a great time. Was refreshing for me"
1,"We really, really don't want you to try to show us you're a good dude by GeTtInG tO kNoW uS. It's nonsense. You did not come here to meet the girl-next-door &amp; you know it. Just admit you wanna look at my tits &amp; pay me.

This is my ultra pet peeve because those that insist on talking first, are a 50/50 gamble, because get this: They friend-zone you because now you're a real person to them. Argh. Nothing more agitating than that happening &amp; then watching them prance off to VIP with the next girl."
2,"Don‚Äôt ever try to haggle with the dancer over ‚Äúwhat this money could get you on the street/another club/backpage‚Äù 

Don‚Äôt insist on knowing her real name. If she tells your name is delicious then it‚Äôs fucking delicious.

Make sure you don‚Äôt pour laundry detergent directly on your clothes when doing the wash or you look a hot ass mess in the black lights at the club.

Don‚Äôt harass the waitresses for lap dances, get a dance from the dancer the waitress isn‚Äôt some unplucked virgin specialness"
3,"Really good, actually. I realized that it‚Äôs normal to have doubts, even if the guy is super great. It‚Äôs a huge commitment and it turned out very nicely for me. He‚Äôs an imperfect husband but he‚Äôs considerate and kind and we‚Äôre devoted to making things work."
4,"reminding myself that i'm in love with/miss who i *thought* they were, not who they are."
5,"There are so, so many. 

Bride Wars comes to mind. 

Oh, we‚Äôre super besties and have been for years and we‚Äôre both getting married!!! But the wedding planner scheduled our weddings for the same day oh no!!!! What ever shall we do?!?!? It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre BEST FUCKING FRIENDS AND CAN WORK THIS OUT. No! Let‚Äôs be catty bitches and fight and sabotage each other. 

That‚Äôs much better than the obvious solution. MAKE IT A DOUBLE WEDDING."
6,"This may be unexpected, but for me, I stopped lying, whether it be a major lie, white lie, or extra details to a story. I found that when I lie, I lose part of my identity and by lying, I am not accepting what is reality and therefore my own reality is messed up. 

I‚Äôve noticed a pattern with people with low self-esteem and how often they lie.

When I stopped lying, I was forced to be as I am. Being honest is liberating, you don‚Äôt have the shackles of the lies you‚Äôve told weighing you down. And it‚Äôs easier to accept myself knowing I am an honest person, and I am happy with the person I was becoming and am now."
7,Pay per song. Ask before you touch. Don‚Äôt beg for kisses or oral. Don‚Äôt ask for phone numbers.
8,"From age 3-10 lived with my single dad and his 2 single brothers who each had a kid (1 boy cousin and 1 girl cousin) they were raising. So essentially we each had 3 dads and no mom. They all cooked, cleaned, braided our hair (yes even the boy because they let his hair grow out too) and got us ready for school everyday, took us to school and picked us up every single day, did hw with us and made sure we were happy. My favorite memory is when one of them would sit with the 3 of us surrounding him and they would have a plate of food and one spoon to put one spoonful in each our mouths at a time. I‚Äôm a girly girl, loves pink but I know how to swing a hammer, fix stuff around my place and decorate it. I think it‚Äôs made me well rounded, they never tried to make me girly or boyish, they let us be kids. We were friends with just as many boys as girls. Ya, they would let us wrestle each other sometime and even make bets l, but hey what are kids for if not to entertain? üòÇ"
9,"I love going home after a busy day of work and not having to hear anyone else talk. To be able to hear myself think again, and not spend a second caring about what anyone around me wants from me, how to speak to someone, how anyone else is feeling but myself. If I want to sing and dance I can, if I want to huddle in a corner and decompress about the day I can. I don't have to try to tell anyone to leave me alone in a way that won't hurt their feelings, listen to their gossip, feel any way about how the chores are balanced or who's taking up how much space."
10,"He put his hand on my back to guide me through a crowd. I don‚Äôt even know why this meant so much or felt so right, but it did, and we‚Äôve been together for the last 3.5 years!"
11,"I had an important appointment on Wednesday. I had it very firmly in mind that it was on Wednesday, and I had to be prepared for it, I had to be ready, because it was on Wednesday. 

On Wednesday, I had no idea it was Wednesday. Periodically throughout Wednesday, I was remembering that I had an important appointment on Wednesday, and I should probably do some groundwork for it. Until I got a message from a friend asking me how it went.

At which point I had a panic attack."
12,I have female friends but I still chose not to have any bridesmaids at my wedding and it was AWESOME! It was super relaxing and less stressful not having to worry about other people. 10/10 would not have a bridal party again
13,"He would ask me if it was okay to touch me, and if I liked it. It was OK and I liked it very much. 

Showing you care about your potential partner's pleasure is sexy."
14,"I‚Äôm a natural redhead. I once had a guy tell me it was ‚Äúsad‚Äù and ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù that I dyed my hair ginger to try and attract Guys, because they could tell the real thing from a fake üôÑ"
15,"We're divorced.  

Background:  We're engaged for a year and a half at this point, 2 months away from the wedding.  We get in a fight (one of many) and the ex says, 'Can we NOT get married?  Is it too late to call things off? Let's just have a party and think about things'.  My response (quite venonmously), 'I don't know about you but I don't have the balls to call this off.  We and our parents have dumped thousands into this party.  We have a child together.  I can't just call 200 hundred people and tell them JUST KIDDING'.  In hind sight, we should have called it off.  He cheated on me 4 years later."
16,"Spend some time alone. 

Agonizingly alone

Watch your friends spend valentines days with their partners, Christmas, birthdays,

Feel the itch for love and ignore it. Spend the time putting yourself together. Go to the gym, make a bucket list, go to a concert on your own.

Really get to know your own company

And after that, someone else‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem so necessary. 

When you love yourself on a deep level, you radiate energy that attracts good people. You need to spend enough time processing to understand the traits that good people have, so you know them when you see them.

It‚Äôs what i did"
17,is this post a personal attack
18,Delicious. Finally some good fucking stripper names.
19,Treated me and talked to meme like a human being rather than a potential vagina to stick their dick into.
20,We're divorced.
21,"No, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with you after work. No, you‚Äôre not turning me on. My stage name is my real name that you are allowed to know, so drop the subject."
22,"just finished watching Sierra Burgess is a Loser, and it's just painful how they're completely okay with catfishing. and (spoilers) Jamey willing to forgive her for that is even more ridiculous"
23,"Everything. I get to walk around naked, don‚Äôt have to shut the door to shower or use the toilet. I can fall asleep wherever I want."
24,"Even if you were a perfect gentleman and had things in common with me and even if I genuinely enjoyed your company while I was working I have friends, I have a life, I have a boyfriend. I don't have time or energy to hang out with you if I'm not getting paid. If you were pleasant to be around you can be one of my favorite customers and I'll always make sure to give you a lot of attention when you come in and we can continue having a good time."
25,"I dont like grinding on you. I just want your money. No you cant have a free song (unless you're paying for the string that earns you one). private dances are expensive. You will pay in advance. You wont fuck me in there. I don't do drugs. I wont give you head. Dont pull my pants to the side. State law is state law and you dont get to see my twat. My knees and my shins and my hands hurt from the stage, pole, and customer's chair arms. I say please and thank you cause my momma taught me right. I wish yours had too. Also... we are dancing rather vigorously in spot lights and showing of our prowess....we sweat....it stinks sometimes...we freshen up as we are able. If you want me for 3 private dances after I've been on stage, I'm gonna smell by the end. Sorry not sorry."
26,Surprised nobody mentioned 50 Shades of Grey yet.
27,"I apologize for the length, but I feel like this question was for me.

I was a nanny in college.  I was actually employed by a service which contracted us out to families so I never truly interviewed with my first family, but I wish I had!  On the surface, they were the perfect family: Gorgeous house in an amazing neighborhood, absolutely perfect lawn and gardens, flowers, etc.  Husband was an executive somewhere, he was handsome, funny and charming. Wife was very pretty, fit, extremely put together, the most amazing clothes, etc.  Even the kids were perfect - a boy and girl - both well mannered, fancy private schools, and on, and on.

It took about two minutes to realize that family was actually an absolute freak show - and it was driven almost entirely by the wife.  She was a total control freak about everything. When I walked into her house for first time, she handed me ""the book"".  The book was 40 some odd pages of rules, time schedules down to the minute*, pictures of sample approved outfits by occasion,* and a menu of approved foods, etc. 

She had an 8 page ""time schedule"" for the kids, down to the minute.  For example, they were on summer vacation, but they had to be up at 6:45 every morning, and I was to wake them up by ringing a little hand bell ""not by speaking their name, or by shaking them.""  Breakfast was to be ""available"" for 15 minutes only, and it had to be from the approved list. Lunch was the same. A little extra crazy, all of their foods *had to be weighed to an exact amount* before they could be eaten and I had to take a picture of everything they ate. As a ""treat"" the kids were allowed a small portion of almonds. That's it. The kids were freaking starving all the time. Any fast food, ice cream, granola bars, cookies, even extra pieces of fruit, etc. were banned (allowing them to have them was listed under ""Fire-able Offenses"").

When they were getting dressed, the wife had a colored tag system for coordinated outfits.  Any clothes that were ripped, spilled on, etc. had to be disposed of ""immediately"".  The book listed everything from approved volume levels for the TVs in the house, how long they could play outside, and what routes were okay for riding their bikes, an approved ""friends list"" and on and on.

And, oh man, that poor husband.  I wasn't around them together much, but when I was you could tell he was utterly broken inside from his life with this woman.  She didn't allow him to keep his ""disgusting beer"" inside the house, so he kept it in a fridge in the garage. Usually, he would just sit out there alone when he got home after she did. One time, I saw him take off his tie and set it on the banister by the stairs. The wife FLIPPED out and screamed at him in front of me. The kids loved him though, and he was a great dad when she wasn't around.

I eventually left because she was so crazy, feeling bad for the kids and the husband when I did. About a year later (and this is your happy ending) I saw the husband and the kids eating at a fast food place, laughing, having the time of their lives, with the wife no where in sight.  No idea if they split or what, but that made me feel so good!"
28,I know I‚Äôll get downvotes for this but it‚Äôs true...I recently lost 50lbs and I finally like myself again.
29,Stayed.
30,Wondered why my house smelled like sugar for a solid five minutes. I was burning the cotton candy candle I‚Äôd made.
31,"He asked me questions about myself in a way that didn't make me feel interrogated and he was genuinely interested in my answers, with lots of followup questions. I'm not normally someone that talks about myself without prompting and a lot of people take advantage of that to endlessly talk about themselves, but with him it seemed like a good 50/50 split."
32,Don't forget that all girl friendships have to consist of two women who are complete opposites. The extroverted person also always has to have blonde hai so you don't confuse them.
33,"It should be the norm that if you enjoy a date, you text immediately after. I hate the dating ""advice"" that you need to wait some arbitrary amount of time before contacting the other person."
34,"Give me the cash for the drink you order for me at the bar. It is just sugar water. 

Don't call me my stage name if you see me out and about during non work hours.

We pray the DJ likes us so we get a short song when doing a lap dance and not Here Comes the Reaper. 

A lot of us own more houses than you. 

If you bring a female with you, she better go up to the stage and tip. We absolutely love when we are thrown shade by some female who thinks she is open minded.

No, even the bartender probably won't go home with you.

I might think of more. But I'm retired from the business for 20 years so things may have changed a bit."
35,"Sounds crazy, but I knew I was going to marry him after our first conversation. No specific reason, just had a gut feeling. I remember going home and telling my mom that there was a nice new guy at work and she said ‚Äúboyfriend material?‚Äù And I told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna marry this guy‚Äù. Seven months later, he pooped the question and we celebrated our ten year wedding anniversary in April"
36,"And  working on accepting that I was 100% projecting what a great relationship **I** was capable of having with them, not being honest with the type of relationship **they** were capable of having with me. Mourned the great 'what if' for a bit then was able to get over it."
37,"Pop Tarts!  A serving size is one and yet they‚Äôre packaged in twos!

Also, in case of emotional emergencies, I don‚Äôt give a hoot what Kraft says.  A servings size  of blue box macaroni and cheese is a box. Same goes for a pint of ice cream."
38,"I always prepare my clothes the night before and lay them near by bed so that when I need to, I can get dressed in under two minutes."
39,"I got out of the shower, threw a towel around myself, walked into my bedroom and started getting dressed. It wasn't until I started to put my shirt on that I noticed that I still had conditioner in my hair - LOTS of conditioner in my hair.  I thought for a moment, ""what would happen if I didn't do anything..."" and then I went and got back in the shower. Ugh."
40,"My favorite movie ever is the princess bride. Not everyone loves it as much as I do, and I accept that. My now 3 year boyfriend asked if we could watch it that night when we got back to our dorm rooms (he was my neighbor) and didn‚Äôt make fun of me quoting half the movie under my breath. At the end of the night he asked me if he could kiss me. 

He was genuinely interested in my favorite things and respectful the whole night. He never made me feel like I was forced to do anything or like I had to find an excuse to get away."
41,The hymen is supposed to tear and bleed or you're not a virgin. Basically everything I've ever had a man say about the hymen.
42,7 years later and still on the fence about things.
43,"Work in a strip club and former stripper: 

We don't like you. Any of you."
44,"- I find myself wanting to impress her specifically

- I think about her often when we're not hanging out

- I worry about looking stupid around her

Felt these things with a friend this time last year. She's now my girlfriend of 11 months."
45,"I got into a fight with a dude in the first couple weeks of college because he tried to explain to me that women don't need pads/tampons--they can just use toilet paper. Nevermind the fact that I'm a woman. Nevermind the fact that it could cause toxic shock. He needed to explain to me that I could use toilet paper instead of pads/tampons.

I grabbed every woman I could in the dorm building to explain to him that 1) almost every woman stuck without a pad/tampon has used toilet paper (it's not a novel idea) and 2) toilet paper wouldn't work long-term.

He still thinks he's right."
46,"Here are some pretty big signs that I genuinely like a girl:

1. I get nervous around her. Since I am usually very easygoing in social situations, it is very noticeable when I start to get all tense after a certain person enters the room.

2. I am constantly trying to find a way to hang out with her. I really value alone time and I do not go out for fun much, so if I am sacrificing the time I would usually spend relaxing, studying, gaming, etc. on someone, it is a clear sign to me that they mean more to me (or I am working towards it) than just a friend.

3. I start envisioning her in my daily activities. I am very independent, but if I really like someone, I want to make sure she is very involved in my life and I in hers.

I guess it hits everyone a little different, though. Those are just some of the things I noticed from my personal experiences."
47,"honestly, any amount of being wishy-washy has never once worked out for me no matter how long i waited.

my current husband was clear about looking for a wife from the start. there was no ambiguity whatsoever."
48,Divorce is ALWAYS more expensive than cancelling a wedding. Lesson learned.
49,That is the moment I fell in love with my husband 6 weeks in.  It was on a bus late at night. I must have looked nervous.  And he put his hand on the small of my back to comfort me.  Done. Over.  Together 8 years. I am still like a teenager... head over heels in love with him.
50,"If it's in correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it at all. Like a tampon. I think it's more convenient than pads or tampons because you don't have to change it for 12 hours, instead of 8. It's also eco-friendly of course.

For me, the cons are that sometimes I don't want to go through the hassle of putting it in/taking it out/cleaning it, so I'll just put a pad on. But for days when I'm out at work or just not home all day, it's super convenient."
51,"If they are actively avoiding the topic, then it's a red flag from the beginning. If they have some hang-up about marriage that means they avoid even the topic, that's way more of a hang-up than I would want to deal with in a relationship. You should be able to talk about your own personal thoughts and feelings about marriage from the beginning of the relationship."
52,"I was 16 and pregnant , and living in a group home . My boyfriend/the father of the baby was not in the system what so ever. I ran away from the group home when they told me I‚Äôll probably be in the group home until I was 18. I got pregnant while I was a runaway. I was only gone for like a week. My now mother in law suggested I get married to him so that I wouldn‚Äôt have the baby while in the group home. I had to go to court with him and convince the judge to let us get married . Which would emancipate me from state custody. I was worried of course. I had only known him for a year by then and we were so so young. But I went through with it anyway and the judge allowed the marriage despite one of my group home parents telling lies about me to convince the judge to not let me get married. She had medical issues and was unable to have kids of her own. She spent months trying to convince me to not get married and let her adopt my baby when the time comes for the babies arrival so that the baby wouldn‚Äôt be born in the system and taken from me and sent to strangers. I refused to listen to her so she got nasty and vengeful. Anywayyys we had a lot of people doubting us. I even doubted it would work. It‚Äôs been 6 years now and I don‚Äôt regret a single thing. We are still happily married and now have two beautiful daughters and we also are now raising my 14 year old brother. I love them all and wouldn‚Äôt change a thing."
53,"Escaping my life for a while, relaxing, learning new things, amusement.

About 1/5 of my free time is spent reading. Lunch breaks, evenings, weekends, while eating breakfast, on the toilet, in public transport"
54,"Dont try to lick my boobs, or blow on my crotch and are you that dumb that you think od give you my real name? Even when i do give you my ""real name"" its just another fake name ive given you. I don't like you, the only reason I'm even fake laughing at your stupid jokes is because i want your money. 
Oh and those shots you keep buying me are nothing more than juice or soda. 
Everything that comes out of my mouth is a lie and im just playing you to get your money- got it?"
55,That's a radical approach but it just might work
56,I‚Äôm sorry but I think deadpan responses like this are hilarious. Sorry about the divorce tho :(
57,"I try very hard to view my body *functionally* rather than *ornamentally*. It matters to me that i‚Äôm out of shape and can‚Äôt run like I used to. It matters to me that my smoking decreases my lung capacity and makes me less healthy. It matters to me that eating healthy and regularly improves on my depression because my body is literally under less stress. I try to focus on these big things (and also the positives, like I am still pretty muscular for a woman who doesn‚Äôt work out so I frequently get asked to help lift heavier things at work, etc) about what my body *does* and mentally sideline how my body *appears* to others. I need my body to *work* to me and be my primary living space, I don‚Äôt need to get any rando‚Äôs dick hard with what I look like. When my body is working well for me and I‚Äôm at a very healthy place, i‚Äôm still short and thicc. And that‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but that‚Äôs what I am. If you‚Äôre here for that, great. If not, well there‚Äôs a huge list of reasons for people not to be attracted to me (my BDE is probably the biggest turnoff, given i‚Äôm a femme woman and most men and many lesbians who like femmes are looking for someone with a stereotypically feminine personality) so like whatever."
58,"Only so many Naveahs, Destinys, and candy‚Äôs can work at one club.

I did know a girl whose stage name was Jessica and her real name was candy though."
59,Dont mind me but your childhood was the perfect setup for a sitcom :D
60,"My ex boyfriend used to humilate me and degrade me all the time,mostly because of my weight. If he notices I lost weight he would say:
""You lost weight but not enough."""
61,"Pretty Woman
A wealthy man falling in love with a sex worker and ‚Äòrescuing‚Äô her from the streets without wanting anything in return."
62,"My husband and I work together and usually drive everywhere together. I am normally in the front passenger seat. I ended up driving to the gas station to get some snacks and when I came out I promptly got into the passenger side. Didn't realize until I closed the door. The parking lot was packed and the driver next to me was sitting in his car staring at me as I face palmed, got out, and went to the driver's side instead."
63,"I watched that movie the other day for a gag and oh my gosh, I don't think the writers have ever heard human people talk to each other."
64,"You need to have a breast reduction because boobs that big hurt your body.

Had a boyfriend removal instead."
65,"We are doing great. I had issues giving up my own way of life. I had lived alone for 6 years and suddenly there was this guy I absolutely loved and he wanted to take up half my space ( more because he is 6'5"" and takes up most of the bed).  I was afraid if commitment but more so I was afraid of making a mistake. Marriage is hard but when you really work at it it gets easier. 


Also counseling really really helps. Pre and post wedding."
66,[removed]
67,"That ‚Äúsomething must have happened to my vagina‚Äù. I have slightly protruding labia and he refused to believe that some just look like that. He asked if someone bit me down there, if I just had a lot of sex, it was the worst conversation I‚Äôve ever had and completely destroyed my sexual confidence. I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy oral sex since!"
68,I got a therapist and a skin care routine.
69,I sat down at my desk this morning and reached up to put my seatbelt on.
70,"I never watched it, but I heard The Ugly Truth was really disgusting and basically just said ‚ÄúMen only want sex, women only want love.‚Äù It got suuuuper bad reviews, thankfully."
71,"OOH ME. I was an RA four three years, let me tell you a few tales:

1- This girl who kept eating durian (smells disgusting, look it up) and leaving it all over the apartment. Her roommates asked her nicely to stop so she left a bunch of it in their beds. 
2- the classy gentleman who was about to have sex with a girl, but somehow got kicked out of her dorm in just HER pink bathrobe, no keys no wallet no phone no shoes. So drunk he ran into a water fountain and bled everywhere, refused ambulance attention and passed out on my couch. 
3- group of exchange students threw their tv out the shied story window at 3 AM because ‚Äòit wasn‚Äôt working anyways‚Äô. 
4- the guy who tried to start a pyramid scheme selling vending machine snacks door to door at outrageous prices until we had to tell him to stop. 
5- my personal favorite, but not really a resident: a squirrel got stuck in a plunger and I had to get him out. Made for some great pics tho. 
Man I have so many more I could go on for hours."
72,"Everything, agreed. 


I bought my house a couple of years ago and it's decorated how I want - every room is mine and full of my personality. My cat sleeps on the bed with me, because there's no one else for him to bother. When I get home, everything is exactly where I left it. I clean as I go, I'm very tidy, and I never come home to find the kitchen has been wrecked or the bed's not been made. All the food in the house is stuff I love and I know it won't mysteriously get eaten. I can watch whatever I want on TV. I can sleep on the sofa if the mood strikes me. I can spend all day in bed if I feel like it. I can eat biscuits in bed if I feel like it! And if I don't want to come home, if I fancy going straight from work to a movie or out with friends, I'm don't have to check in with anyone.


I do love being in a relationship, but there's lots of nice little positives about the freedom of living by myself!"
73,"I love reading. It's like watching a movie in my mind. But no one knows what I'm ""watching"" so embarrassing scenes or inappropriate scenes are for my eyes only. 

I read anytime I need to mentally check out. Could be a few minutes waiting in a car pool line or hours sitting outside. I've been known to pull an all nighter with new book releases from my favorite author.

Have no fear, I didn't develop a love for reading until my thirties."
74,"I dated a guy who waited the next day, and when he texted that soon it was this huge sigh of relief. His friend chided him for making a ""rookie mistake,"" but honestly it made me so excited to see him because I felt like he was excited to see me. I almost immediately stopped bothering talking to a few others who were playing the text mind games."
75,Serenity by Jan?
76,"I've had a guy tell me I must have something wrong with me because I have some hairs on my stomach. I had to tell him no, just because everyone and the media acts as if women naturally have no hair on our bodies, doesn't mean we don't."
77,"I slowly fell out of love with a guy. When we started dating he was great, then he slowly expected me to turn into his mother. He stopped helping around the apartment, he stopped wanting to do anything with me, he only wanted to play video games. I eventually had enough so I gave back the ring.

I said I was going to focus on myself for a year so I renewed my climbing gym membership. There I met a big group of friends who met up every week, and was invited to a party. The host was gorgeous, and asked me on a date, so I said yes then freaked out and texted him no the next day.

2 months later I had a dream. I don't remember the dream, but when I woke up I just knew in every fiber of my body that he was the guy I was going to marry. The guy who I had already turned down and who was doing his best to ignore me. Besides, I'm no romantic. I didn't have time for love nonsense.

I couldn't shake the feeling, and two weeks later I was lonely in Canada, on a work trip and sharing a car with a terrible coworker, so I texted him,and the conversation just flowed. I still wasn't sure until he texted me a picture of the spreadsheet he had made to calculate his electrical usage compared to every available plan so he could pick the cheapest, and I knew he was the one.

We're not engaged yet, but 2 years in I haven't shaken that feeling, and we know who we want to cater the wedding so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
78,"For me, it was staying single and not looking for a relationship. I isolated myself from society so I could find myself and find my self worth. It was and is still working for me."
79,"I swear most men think everything is done to please them.

I‚Äôm gonna dye my hair purple soon ( one day... ) and it‚Äôs purely because it‚Äôs awesome"
80,"Even though it‚Äôs a comedy, Wedding Crashers. Owen Wilson‚Äôs character lies about who he is and basically just stalks Rachel McAdams‚Äô character, totally disrespects her relationship and even goes as far as poisoning her boyfriend."
81,That his butt is better than mine. Worst part is he is right. Also I married him.
82,Stop using your phone while pooping.
83,"Not a stripper but worked with a waitress who was also a stripper. We once had to work an event for young farmers and one of her tables had people who recognised her from the club, and they were quite vulgar to her. I bet she would have loved to be treated with respect and discretion at her waitressing job by her clientele."
84,"Maybe not worst but after our first date we were walking side by side and he was looking at me. He says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not taller than me, I was looking at your insta and it seemed like you might be a giant. If you‚Äôd have been 6‚Äù6 or something I might‚Äôve said I was busy if you wanted a second date‚Äù. I still don‚Äôt know what pics he meant on insta because imo I don‚Äôt look super tall in any of them."
85,"I went away on a business trip for 4 days and completely forgot to tell my roommate I would be arriving back on Monday around 1am. When I got to my house, she had deadbolted the door shut and was sleeping so even though I had unlocked it with my key, I had no way to get inside the actual house. 100% my fault because I didn‚Äôt communicate with her that I needed it left with the deadbolt off and of course I expect her to take extra safety precautions when she‚Äôs home alone overnight. 

I ended up POUNDING on the door, calling her phone multiple times and yelling her name through the tiny crack in the door just praying she would hear me and wake up so I wouldn‚Äôt have to sleep on the sidewalk. Hallelujah, she did but I felt so terrible for waking her up because I had simply forgotten to send her 1 easy text in the daytime."
86,"In college, my advisor was a wonderful woman who was a single mom of two twin boys who had some behavioral and mental health issues. She had been abandoned by the father at 9 months pregnant. Her life was pretty tough and a mess and since she helped me with my career so much, I wanted to help as much as possible and babysat for her as much as possible. She could rarely hold on to a sitter. 

Most of the time wasn‚Äôt too bad. These were clearly good hearted kids who just had some issues. They would fight loads but I learned how to handle it. 

However, one time when they were 8, the one with more difficulties was out of control. He tried to lunge at me and ended up biting me and kept trying to hurt me. He spurred on his brother to try to attack me with a lamp. Eventually I literally just bear hugged the first brother to stop him from trying to hurt me. I know this made it worse but I didn‚Äôt know what else to do and I knew from previous experience that he would wear himself out soon enough. 

It was a very tense 10 minutes. He ended up bursting into tears and hugging me while apologizing for his behavior profusely. His brother followed suit. I cried a little bit too, it was so tense and they both fell asleep within minutes. 

For some reason, I downplayed the whole event a lot to the mom and didn‚Äôt tell her he had bit me. I don‚Äôt know, I just ended up feeling worse for her than myself given she had to deal with it every day."
87,Actually liked that I was playfully making fun of him the whole night and didn‚Äôt get defensive. Great banter all night and about a year later we‚Äôre still going strong!
88,"I was.

And I'm not sure that it had any affect, tbh.  

He gave us a wide birth to do pretty much whatever we wanted, and didn't press gender roles or performative femininity on us."
89,"Every girl has different boundaries, you should always ask/communicate with a girl to understand what she is or isn't okay with. My stripper name is the only name your getting because it's a way for me to safely conceal my identity from potentially predatory men. No you wont get my phone number either, you can look up SO much information about someone just from their phone number. This industry is still underground and largely stigmatized, we have every right to protect ourselves."
90,"I miss him every day. It's been almost 3 months since we broke up officially, over 2 years since I met him, and almost a year since things got rocky and we started breaking up on and off. I just got my restraining order yesterday and haven't served it to him yet. He cheated on me 6 times, lied to me constantly, told me to kill myself, insulted and degraded me, and decimated my self esteem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just go through the motions. I got a job. I've been getting up every day to go there. I developed a skin care routine. Daily self care feels good. I do my makeup and wear dressy clothes every day even though my job is business casual. I wear heels every day. It feels good. I try to eat healthy and take my vitamins, but I don't deny myself the occasional treat. Soon I want to start working out. The sadness wears off a little more every day."
91,"You realize that the standards are created to almost guarantee that you fail.  That most of us fail.  They're designed to make us insecure and dependent on products to help us feel better -- whether that's diet and exercise products, or cosmetics, or comfort food or alcohol or whatever.  If you try to meet those standards, you're giving your power over to a system that just wants to milk you for cash.  The only way to win is not to play."
92,"Omg this morning I jolted awake at about 4 am, realised I wasn't feeling well and wouldn't be able to go to work, and decided to text my boyfriend (who was happily sleeping away next to me) so he wouldn't worry when he saw me sleeping in. So I sent a few rapid-fire texts explaining the situation.

Context, my bf usually turns off his phone's sound at night because I'm a light sleeper and notifications can wake me up. Cue my dismay when, a few seconds after sending my messages off, I hear his phone start to ping a bunch of times. Once or twice is reasonable, but who tf is blowing up his phone at 4 am?? (Note this thought was more like 'oh dear is there a family emergency' vs any suspicion). I then text him to let him know his phone has gone off a bunch. And just did it again. And again.

After the 6th time I feel like this is JUST TOO MUCH, and wake him up to check his phone. As he fumbles to unlock I realize that I am a massive, massive idiot and apologize profusely."
93,Not having to worry about splitting bills and if everyone is splitting everything fairly. Who bought toilet paper and paper towels last? Who left the dishes in the sink? All me!
94,"I was in highschool and it was the first time, FIRST TIME I had ever gotten to second base with my shirt off. We were kissing and exploring when he ran his hand down my stomach and feels a few hairs. Like just above peach fuzz. I never thought anything of it... Until this dickwad goes and I quote, ""omg, omg, omg, you're trans!?"". This poor boy had no idea that women grow hair on their bodies in places other than arms and legs. 

That shit fucked my 16 year old self up, hard. I shaved my stomach for like 6 years after that until I was finally like fuck it. Looking back now I find it fucking hilarious that his dumb ass thought that. However, it also makes me wonder if that mom and dad were sitting on that kids ""at home"" education."
95,"I initiated sex out of drunken nervousness, and he said he didn't want to do that on the first date.  Not only did I appreciate his self-restraint, but he was really sweet about telling me no, I didn't feel weird about it at all."
96,Had just one bridesmaid. No regrets.
97,only go to prog rock strip clubs.
98,"He listened to me. He was genuinely interested in getting to know me. My best, present and future too. we had dinner and saw a movie. Held my hand while making me walk on the inside from the road(completely new to me). But my favorite part was after we drove around our hometowns for about 2-3 hours just talking and getting to know each other. It was perfect."
99,Basically when I start wondering what it would be like to kiss her or hold her hand or kinky shit like that. Also getting more easily embarrassed or shy around her.
100,"I will respect you as a person by offering you money for your labor and skills.

I don't really see a big difference between this and the guy who thinks the girl at the coffee shop is flirting with him. Dude, she has to be friendly, she's at work. Smile, buy your latte, and move on, unless you're going to buy another latte I guess."
101,"This came up for me in real life kind of- my best friend since 5th grade was my maid of honor (I have two sisters, who can pick one?) and my husbands brother was his best man. They‚Äôd been dating for a couple years and he wanted to propose on her birthday (a month after the wedding) but I said why not do it during our wedding? Since they both had to be on stage giving speeches and the photographer would already be on them. She was so shocked and her face (captured by said photographer) was one of ‚Äúomg get the fuck this is someone else‚Äôs wedding what are you doing get up‚Äù. She looked at me with my big fat grin and tears in my eyes and quickly realized I okayed all that. But everyone was so shocked I did. Who WOULDNT want your best friend that happy?!!! What‚Äôs wrong with you jerks that would rather something be all about you than give your bff the memories of a lifetime?! 

TL;DR my bff since grade school is now my SIL and they got engaged at my wedding"
102,So just pick a long song. Badda bing badda boom üòéü§ô
103,"Divorced after watching him turn into a completely different person. I always knew he needed some kind of vice to get through but I never imagined I would be divorcing him because he was an abusive addict. 

I‚Äôve known him for 9 years, we started dating when I was 14. Something always felt off. Trust yourself. üòû"
104,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. 

Passengers

Chris Pratt and whatsherface from Hunger Games basically romanticize murder. 

It's awful."
105,"Invalidating my pain. I've had an acquaintance who'd always shit on me if I couldn't make plans because of my period. His argument was that other women can deal with it too, so I should stop being such a baby. He finally stopped when I once fainted because the pain was so bad."
106,I feel like the better question is what romantic movie *doesn't* have the most ridiculous and unrealistic portrayal of women/men lol
107,I know who ate all the ice cream.
108,"Avoiding the topic in the first place is a red flag. You should be partners who trust each other with vulnerable discussions and are brave enough to share. If your partner doesn't know what they want, they should say that. If your partner wants something different from you, they should say that. Loving someone means wanting the best for them... even if that's not you."
109,"I was with someone and we were still shy around each other, but things were heating up. He asked me if he could take his shirt off, which I was completely okay with. Then he asked me if he could touch me, which was even more okay with me. It was amazing to be asked that, and it's possible I responded even more enthusiastically that I would have without that question. 

&amp;#x200B;

The affirmative consent was my jam that night"
110,"I had a boyfriend (older, virgin) tell me (also virgin) that if/when we ever had sex, it was supposed to hurt me so badly that I'd 'scream and cry'. Even after we broke up, I was still frightened to have sex because I was terrified of it hurting!

(Aforementioned boyfriend took the liberty of creating a Word Document planning every step of our hypothetical mutual virginity-loss, down to the removing of our shoes and socks. Think: ""Step 1. I remove shoes. Step 2. Lacedaisy removes her shoes."" all the way down to  ""Step 11: Missionary position 5-10 min. Step 12: Cowgirl position 5-10 min. Step 13: Butterfly position 5-10 min."""
111,Please don‚Äôt edit this üòÇüòä‚ù§Ô∏è
112,Honestly these responses are making me so thankful I found the courage to call off my wedding 6 months prior. We 100% would‚Äôve been divorced within a couple of years.
113,"I've never been married but was the MOH for my sister's first wedding. (Which should tell you how things turned out right there.) Just as I was about to walk down the aisle ahead of her, I looked back and she burst into tears and said to my dad, ""What the hell am I doing?"" He's useless in emotional situations and didn't do much to comfort her. I hesitated and waited a minute for her to compose herself and she went through with it and then we drank like fish. Had a great time at the reception. 

Anyway, after two kids and maybe 6-7 years at most, he was not only cheating on her, but tried to move his new GF in *with* them. She came home from a 12-hour shift to find the GF throwing her things out into the yard, as if it's okay to just boot a woman with two small children out into the street. Mom helped her get into an apartment and they were divorced shortly thereafter."
114,He didn't really believe in foreplay and when I expressed dissatisfaction in our sex life he told me that I 'should just get wet from seeing his erect penis' and he 'shouldn't have to do anything'. Ummm okay. Such a shame. He had such a nice dick but that was some of the worst sex. He pretty much just decided there was something wrong with me and my body. I found out later he told our friends that I didn't like sex. Nah man I just didn't like it with you.
115,"I was an RA for two years, then a CM for a year (their promotion track, had a building instead of a floor).

My first floor was 45 men and 45 women in different wings. One boy wore a tail and was extremely feminine. I was worried he'd be bullied, so I checked in a lot, but he was fine. Weirdest was the Master Yammer, an anonymous ""good samaritan"" who gifted everyone multiple yams on SEVERAL occasions, buy they were at least delicious."
116,Former: don‚Äôt touch my p?$$y...
117,"I read the book(s) for a gag and I can tell you straight up it's because that writer is ""oh my gosh"" not a good writer .. and then was on the set of each movie making sure that she ""oh dear"" had her masterpiece presented as it was intended. Just mind blowingly awful the whole way around."
118,"Told me one boob was smaller than the other - insinuating that it was weird. He also gasped when he saw my ears for the first time cause he thought they were big. (They‚Äôre not) 

A guy was rubbing my clit too hard and I told him to stop cause it was too intense and didn‚Äôt feel good. He was like, no just ride it out, it will start feeling good."
119,"I got married at a court house. If we ever decide to have an actual wedding. I plan to kidnap his brother (one of my best friends) and a few of his female cousins I have become close to, to help fill out my ranks since my husband would probably have close to 5 or 6 groomsmen. 

Having said that I have only ever been a bridesmaid once and would probably volunteer myself to help fill someone elses ranks even if we were basically strangers. Weddings are a blast and I would love to help a girl in need out. Dm me if you want and we can see if we live near eachother."
120,Pretending to be low maintenance or not bothering him with my feelings just cause it'd be uncomfortable
121,We're both happily married. To other people.
122,"First and foremost, we‚Äôre all trying to be functioning, productive, and useful human beings. But remember, some of those people who look like they have all their ducks in a row are just working their butts off to keep up appearances. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre doing a-ok, so be nice to yourself. 

Now to the meat. If you‚Äôre wanting to look put together, I suggest ensuring what you own fits your body. Good fit and tailoring is everything. Even an expensive piece looks cheap if it doesn‚Äôt fit properly. On the topic of clothing quality, I‚Äôm of the mind it‚Äôs better to have good quality, functional, and flexible pieces that may have cost a bit more upfront, than say fast fashion. It‚Äôs a better investment per wear, and will last washes, and wear and tear. Good pieces I find are natural materials, think cotton, wool, silk, leather etc. Coordinating a wardrobe is hard (still working on that), but if you can somehow ensure that a number of the pieces can easily match each other, while transitioning between uses, that is a plus. Think a top that can be casual, or if you toss on some accessories, perhaps a tailored blazer, it‚Äôs great for night/more formal functions than day to day. Or great black jeans that can be used for interviews, dressed up, or casual wear. 

On the topic of accessories, they can really add to a wardrobe without you having to invest in more clothes. Adding belts, jewelry, and adornments can really alter a look, and make you look like you have your stuff in order. Again, investing in longevity pieces such as belts, simple purses, that with a little love can last years and years is highly suggested (but costume jewelry is pretty great too!). The same can be said for shoes. Classic shoes like the riding boot, a simple black pump, Oxford lace ups, or flats of good construction can really sharpen a look. Quality means you can shine them, replace heels, and keep them in good working order for ages. 

Skin care: start early, and be consistent. Use products that are tailored to your skin type, but remember there‚Äôs a ton out there. If one doesn‚Äôt work, there‚Äôs always another option. Me personally, I‚Äôve finally nailed down a good regiment with a variety of western and Korean products that I had to trial and error. I‚Äôm focused on hydration, anti aging, and sun protection. Start early, and use sunscreen every day. Also, hydrate, and remember stress is your enemy. A lot or stress just ain‚Äôt worth it. If you‚Äôre stressing on this whole ‚Äúfunctional adult thing‚Äù, don‚Äôt. Life is too too short. You deserve better than that. 

Workouts I think depends on time, budget, and your current activity level. Find something that fits your needs and interests, and keeping motivated is all you need. Bonus points if there‚Äôs a great supportive community, because then it won‚Äôt feel like work!"
123,"In my half asleep state, I was trying to change my daughter's diaper. While changing her...I just put a clean diaper on over the dirty one. It took me a few seconds to realize I didn't actually change her. Lol"
124,"According to your metric, I have a crush on literally all of my friends and several acquaintances."
125,By changing my own ways and putting myself and my wants/needs first.
126,"Omg you know I fucking love full house and I never drew the parallel. But no, it really happened in the bowels of Haiti and my dad and 2 uncles did raise us by themselves for a good 7 years before we moved to the United States to be with the rest of their family. But shit, I‚Äôm a dumbass for not even seeing I basically had a full house lifeüòÇ"
127,"Whoa whoa whoa, handholding is taking it too far. Think of the children.

/s/"
128,I'm glad he's your ex. What an asshole
129,Use one-ply toilet paper. Over my dead fuckin body.
130,I don't really like the super ripped look. I also don't really like the super lean look either. I like a muscular body but you can tell they enjoy pasta.
131,Learned the detergent thing the hard way when my black dress looked like I‚Äôd been splattered with spunk last time I was in a strip club.
132,"Another perk is that you never have to worry about buying, asking for, or carrying around tampons or pads after you initially put it in.  It's in your nature's pocket."
133,"I get this too. I used to go home and replay the night and beat myself up over every little thing. 
It went away over time, once I developed more confidence."
134,I was told I was too fat to have sex with. We hadn't even been on out first date yet so he was assuming much.
135,"It was at a very Christian university where he lived in an all boys dorm. He paraded me around to each room just to prove he actually brought a girl home and made a big show out of closing the door ""for privacy."" Proceeded to make me sit on the floor the whole time because the only seat in his room was his bed and he wasn't allowed to share a bed with a woman til marriage. Saw him again anyway ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
136,It‚Äôs so stupid that guys like this understand there is variation in male genitals but will not accept it in female genitals.
137,I liked the vast majority of my strip club customers.
138,"I was the drunk girl, I went out to a bar with some guy I was casually sleeping with trying to get over my ex. He got wasted and was an absolute ass and I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I went to the bathroom to get some privacy because I thought I was going to have a break down.

So there I was drunk and alone in this tiny 2 stall bathroom just standing there wondering how the fuck I got to where I was and so far away from where I wanted to be. 

This group of woman walked in. I tried to look like I‚Äôm just checking my makeup and wasn‚Äôt some creep hanging out in the bathroom. But maybe it‚Äôs like sisterhood instinct or my drunk acting wasn‚Äôt very convincing but not a minute into them entering they were asking me if I were okay. 

I was so distraught I told them what was happening and they huddled around me and told me I was going to be okay and hugged me. That night they adopted me into their group so I wouldn‚Äôt have to be with the guy. 

I‚Äôm so so so grateful for them. Those women were wonderful to me for no reason other than because I needed it. Their kindness stuck with me and I try to pass it along to everyone."
139,"I was at a friends house when the Sex and the City 2 movie was on as kinda background noise. 

It‚Äôs portrayal of women is utterly horrendous."
140,"Therapy and having a zero-tolerance policy for relationships that made me feel bad, which includes friends, hook ups, and family members."
141,"I used to do that. But I always feel different the next day. As in, I'd have an ""I feel fat day"" or ""I feel super sexy day"" and always end up back to the closet in the morning."
142,Isn't this full house?
143,"I can't name anything specific but I believe TV really portrays girlfriends wrong. It's not always a struggle. Everything's not a game. We don't always make your lives difficult and have y'all whipped. Sometimes it's the boyfriend that can't ever decide what he wants to eat. Sometimes its the girlfriend that drives everywhere and pays for things. We don't mess with your head, and we don't play tricks constantly. We can be a wonderful experience if you treat us right. We just want a healthy happy relationship. TV always makes it look like the girlfriend seems nuts and puts the guys through hell for no reason. It's annoying."
144,"I hate to be THAT person but the first day I met him. He came on vacation to the city I was living in, met me randomly, and we fell and love and he never left.

It's been 6 years, and I still wake up every day, look at him and think HOW TF DID I SWING THIS"
145,"Cosigning student loans üëçüèª don't cosign anything for anybody, y'all."
146,"Yeah I think it depends on the type of doubts. 

Some doubt is normal. I had doubts with my husband, I magnified his flaws, I got scared of being tied down, etc. Stereotypical cold feet. 

But then it passed. We‚Äôve only been married six years, but we have a great relationship, 2 amazing kids, and while we do have issues, we always work through them well. 

My sister had doubts. Her husband was an ex alcoholic and ex drug addict. The whole family told her not to marry him. She doubted, and went through with it anyway. Turned out, he wasn‚Äôt an ex addict. They‚Äôre divorced."
147,2 Oreos per serving
148,Have you ever tried to open your front door with your car key fob? Beep beep open up the door!!!!
149,You probably like her.
150,"It was lots of little things. Building up my self esteem required a journey to become the person I wanted to be. I set myself small, achievable goals. I mentally celebrated when I achieved them. I kept repeating this until I had lots of things I was proud of, lots of new skills, interests and hobbies. I became a person I could love."
151,"&gt;Make sure you don‚Äôt pour laundry detergent directly on your clothes when doing the wash or you look a hot ass mess in the black lights at the club.

Well, fuck"
152,"I usually shower, pack my lunch, and plan out my outfit the night before so I'm not scrambling. I also don't do my makeup until I get to work.

 I've noticed a huge difference with traffic and my commute time if I skip the makeup to leave home 20 minutes earlier, manage to find a nice parking spot, and then do my makeup in the bathroom without any rush. 

On the days that I do my makeup before leaving for work, I find myself very anxious about making it on time because of the huge difference in traffic, causing an unnecessary increase to my commute time, plus I end up finding parking wayyy in the back of the building and speed walking to my desk just minutes before I should be there."
153,"1) we had a gender neutral bathroom with one stall so naturally people had sex in it. One couple would leave the door unlocked and several of my residents and myself walked in on them several times.

2) I had one international student who would either walk into my room unannounced or bang on my door at any hour of the night and ask me to help them with their laundry 

3) the boy down the hall who had a crush on my boyfriend and would try to catch him in his boxers"
154,"Oh thank god I needed that ending.

What a horrifying situation, those poor children."
155,"I am pretty blunt and I think that anyone with a relationship goal like marriage shouldn't be ashamed of expressing what they want.

My husband expressed that he wasn't keen on marriage when we first started dating. I had a feeling and I followed it, asking him more open questions about what he felt etc. And we established that his previous engagement had left him feeling pressured and unhappy. We drew the conclusion that he didn't want a big wedding and he was unhappy with how his last engagement was handled by his ex. So we talked about that - I wanted marriage for several reasons that were negotiable by other means and he recognised that marriage was the easiest legal catch-all to protect each other in the event of a medical emergency.

If he hadn't been willing to have those conversations, I would have ended the relationship. If I'm going to spend my life with someone, we need to be able to talk about what we want. Ultimately my husband found our life goals aligned with his newfound definition of what marriage could mean for him."
156,"I have bronchitis and left work early to go home and rest. Decided to make a pit stop before heading home, sneezed when I was pulling into a parking spot, and swiped another vehicle. Looking to be almost $2k in damage to my car. Other vehicle seemed like it was just scuffed up and had paint transfer. Looks like I'm eating soup for the next month to save enough to cover what insurance can't."
157,"Former stripper: Stop asking for my real name, no you can‚Äôt have my number, yes it‚Äôs all about the money (stop saying that, to try and guilt me, when you try and get shit for free or touch me without consent.)"
158,"My wife and I were watching that. On one hand, we enjoyed it as a light movie, bu the moment we put any thought into the film, we realised just how not okay it was. Hell, if it was gender swapped, it'd play out like a straight up thriller (minus Michael Jackson). But everyone we spoke to didn't seem to see a problem with the actual story and it's contents and message."
159,"Same experience except naturally curly hair. I was told it looked fake and guys didnt like curly hair that much anyways. I would look better if I kept it natural. I think he was trying to compliment me by saying I didnt need to do all that to my hair, when in reality I have no control over the mood of my hair lol. Takes more time and effort to straighten it."
160,About 5 months in. I said it. He laughed when I did because he didn't realise it was the first time. He told me he had been thinking it for so long that he didn't know he hadn't said it out loud. What a numpty.
161,"50 First Dates I believe it's called. Drew Barrymore's character can't create new memories due to a brain injury and Adam Sandler's character keeps ""wooing"" her every single day. She will never be able to remember him, but he keeps trying and eventually they marry and have a child. Can you imagine suddenly waking up with a huge pregnant stomach with no idea of how it happened?"
162,"Drinks that list the serving size as 4oz when it's in a 16 oz bottle. Don't make me do math, man."
163,That we're always like... weirdly put together all the time as if we're expecting a hot date. You see a woman on tv in her own home at 10pm wearing a full face of makeup with her bra still on. Come on.
164,"As my boyfriend sat on the bed, I sweetly asked him if he wanted any water. I poured him a large glass of cold water, then, when I thought he had gripped the glass, I managed to drop the glass and dump the water all over his lap and the bed as I handed it to him."
165,"Exactly this. My fianc√© and I are both in our 30‚Äôs. He brought it up on our second date. Not like in a creepy or crazy way, but because he didn‚Äôt want us wasting each other‚Äôs time if we weren‚Äôt on the same page in terms of wanting marriage or a family. If you‚Äôre looking to get into a serious relationship, and especially you‚Äôre our age, you should know how you fundamentally feel about these topics, and you should be able to articulate those feelings openly and honestly."
166,"My ex once told me at the beginning of our relationship that if I only were ""10cm taller, had red hair and green eyes"" I would be the women of his dreams. I didn't think much back then (I was young, stupid and needy) but 8 years later he cheated on me with a woman who looked exactly like that, lol."
167,"""Men don't need pants. They can just wear sheets around their waist."""
168,Playing hard to get is the easiest way to make someone uninterested lol
169,Believed him when my gut told me not to.  Trust yourself and your instincts!
170,"Have a partner who‚Äôs alarm goes off at 5:30, that way when my 6:30 alarm goes off, I‚Äôm already wide awake.

In general:
* straightening my unruly hair the night before 
* mentally prepping my outfit so I know what I‚Äôm looking for in the morning
* leaving handbag near the door with everything I need for the next day"
171,"I was a witness to a pretty bad accident.  It's a long story, but basically a drunk driver creamed these two cars at a stop light, which then propelled them into two other cars, sending one of the cars into the intersection where it was t-boned by an unrelated car. 

I was to their right at the intersection, waiting to turn left. I parked the car to check on the people, see if I could help, and called 911.  The police asked me to give a witness statement, so I did.  I could remember every detail, the order the collisions, who hit which car, and so on. 

Months later, the drunk driver and the dude that collided with the car pushed into the intersection are BOTH disputing what I saw.  The drunk driver is saying that 1) he was stopped at the stop light, 2) wasn't drunk, and 3) was the real victim in the whole deal. Other dude is saying that the car hit into the intersection was really trying to blow through the light. 

It was surreal, it was like they saw and were involved in a completely different accident, both of them with distinctly different accounts of what happened. The one guy basically said, ""well, there is no way she could have seen all this because of where she was stopped."" But I was probably the only person who could see everything because of where I was at the light.

Anyhow, big ordeal that ended poorly for the drunk driver.  Most importantly, everyone was okay."
172,"Right!? I saw one episode of Survivor, it was a friend‚Äôs favorite show, and laughed and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not very realistic. The guys have beards but the women have no armpit or leg/bikini hair? They‚Äôre surviving all the way to the island resort day spa.‚Äù"
173,"I suddenly feel like an expert on something lol.

I've been raised by my single father since I was about 18 months old. I think it became the most challenging during puberty, since I basically had to learn everything about being a woman alone. My dad did try to help, but most of this was well-intentioned misinformation (women always shave their forearms, I should Nair my upper lip, pads are for everyone,etc).

But the most lasting effect of this is the fact that I have a much harder time creating lasting friendships with female peers. I get along well with older women, but anyone within a couple of years' age difference feels like a complex puzzle of passive communication. I don't like women who don't say what they're really thinking and try to passive-aggressively ""fix"" problems."
174,"I had a male roommate who commented on my new colorful sport socks that men don‚Äôt like those. ‚ÄúThey are not sexy‚Äù. 
Ffs"
175,"I'm sure you've heard it before, but honestly, stopping the negative self-talk. I had to really try and work on it, but wow, was I mean to myself. I wouldn't talk to anyone else that way, so why was it ok to talk to myself like that? Don't be afraid to tell yourself you're awesome, you're beautiful, you rock. 
Just a small tip, but it helped. Be kind to yourself, forgive yourself, and understand that everyone messes up. Don't hold yourself to standards you don't hold others to, (ie, if you'd forgive your best friend for it, forgive yourself too). Hope that helps a little."
176,"100% agreed. I had no bridesmaids. I had one friend who I asked to make a speech. It was awful (I don‚Äôt think she prepared for it at all) and she complained to various people after the wedding that I didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to her at the wedding, affirming that I made the right decision not having bridesmaids."
177,"It sure as fuck feels like one. Damn OP, why you gotta murder a whole sub like this?"
178,"My husband and I picked out the ring together. When he proposed two months later, I didn‚Äôt even see the ring; I was just so excited that he was asking! I don‚Äôt think I really looked at it until someone else asked to see it."
179,"The way I see it, is that the couple has spent hundreds or thousands on what is supposed to be a very memorable day. They want it to be one day where it's just about them. I don't think it's too much to ask."
180,...good yamaritan?
181,Whoaaa that's edging a little bit to the creepy side
182,"This reminds me, one time I was scrubbing my face with soap and wondered, ""I wonder if I still have my contacts in."" I opened my eyes to see if my vision was clear or blurry. The burning that followed.... I screamed."
183,"Just ... be a good conversationalist.  Say things that imply you're looking for the same thing I'm looking for -- that you're not married, or looking for a hookup, or so busy from work that you don't really have time for a relationship.  Have a couple of shared interests in me.  Flirt a tiny bit, seem to link what you see across the table from you.  

The bar is not high.  Still, not many clear it."
184,Been there. Anxiety takes over when you think 'shiiiiiiit'
185,"Yes to the houses!! I did the tax returns of about a dozen strippers for a few years and some of them are sitting quite pretty, financially. Not like it's all glamour and houses and fun times, and surely there's a lot of problematic undertones to much of the industry, but for the ones I knew who controlled their own career, they did quite well for themselves. So the attitude of pity that many of our accountants had was inacct, at best"
186,"Its the emotional attachment you still have to them. I got rid of it by stopping the romanization of anything that happened between us, and reminding myself that was him at that current time driven by his feelings, while current him does not give a shit about me. And that doesn't faze me one bit. Someone who does that (throws people away once theyre done using you) is someone who doesn't deserve anything from me. Im gonna surround myself with people that do give a shit for the betterment of my life. Look at the reality of things and remind yourself of how important you are. Your happiness doesn't depend on them or their presence in your life. You have other things you love and you should enjoy them. Good luck to anyone going through this, its tough."
187,As far as I remember the whole story started off as a fanfiction for twilight. At some point she decided to make it a separate story and here we are.
188,"People who treat a conversation only as a way of talking about themselves. Only listening to answer, never asking follow-up questions, not interested in your point of view"
189,"I don't understand how people huff and scoff over ""asking for consent"" since it ""breaks the moment"". But it's such a panty dropper for me?? Knowing that the other person cares about my boundaries makes me relax and let go instantly.

Having someone whisper into my ear ""is this okay with you?""..... *lord*"
190,"This is how I viewed my first time at the strip club. ""im here to see tits. I know it, they know it, her is some cash for a dance."""
191,"When my sister announced her pregnancy, she kind of just said she had something important to tell me and held eye contact, and a moment later I blurted ""omg are you having a baby?!"" It was a big moment and joyous for us both, and the story of how I ""guessed"" was retold several times as an indicator of how close we had gotten and how happy I was to become an aunt.


Six years later she retold the story as something my other sister did, and insisted that she had to flat out tell me, and that I initially didn't believe her, and only when her bf backed her up did I congratulate her. I let her have the new version, even though it puts a horribly negative spin on what was one of my most treasured memories between the two of us. It's quite likely I will never share a moment like that with her again, and I don't trust her recollection of anything very much anymore."
192,"Genuinely laughed at one of my jokes, and made a similar joke back."
193,I usually congratulate people on their divorces. Good Riddance!
194,"Things probably have changed quite a lot, particularly when it comes to women (not *females*) heading out with a partner or friends to watch other women dance."
195,He remembered little things that I had talked about before that even I forgot about. Also texted me right afterwards telling me that he acknowledged that I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and didn't want to do anything out of my comfort zone but that he would love to see me again.
196,"Body odor happens, gentlemen, and you‚Äôre watching someone burn a FUCK TON of calories right in front of you. I can‚Äôt believe this is a real issue."
197,"Went on an unprompted rant about feminism and women taking jobs away from men, then segued into some healthy conspiracy theories about jews.

I consider myself a feminist, was studying to be an engineer at the time (it's how we met actually, in the same class), and am Jewish."
198,I flush every single time.  That's non negotiable.
199,I‚Äôm an insurance agent and was doing a quote. I tried to ask the body style of the car and meant to say ‚Äúis it a coupe or a coach?‚Äù Instead I said ‚Äúis it a cooch‚Äù
200,"I didn't do a lot of babysitting, so this is probably pretty tame. But one night my parents and their friends went out to dinner and had me (about 14 at the time) babysit their son, who would have been around 2. Well out of habit, his parents grabbed their diaper bag and took it to dinner with them. We didn't have any baby supplies at our house, so I called to let them know. They were like ""ehh it'll be fine, won't be gone for too long"". So of course within a short time he needed a diaper change. I ended up putting a menstrual pad in a pair of my underwear and safety putting them so they would sort of fit him. He ended up peeing, which leaked out, then slipped in it and got a bloody nose from hitting his face on the floor. I got it all under control and he fell asleep about 10 minutes before they got back."
201,"His parents hated me and I should have listened to my instincts - I was nervous that it would eventually cause a rift between us. I hoped for the best, married him, and got my ass handed to me in the divorce. Part of me still misses him."
202,"I‚Äôve had several guys throughout my life tell me that I was way too tall for them, even though A. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and B. The vast majority of them were still taller than me by a few inches.

Apparently being slightly above average height makes me intimidating and not cute. :\"
203,"&gt; Don't call me my stage name if you see me out and about during non work hours.

That actually happens? Jeez, seems like a no-brainer to me..."
204,This is my job. I‚Äôm not here to keep you company. Pay me or leave.
205,"The ex who supposedly got another girl knocked up and then told me that if I wasn‚Äôt also pregnant, it was because I couldn‚Äôt have babies and he couldn‚Äôt be with a woman who can‚Äôt have babies. Oh, and could he have the ring back? He wants to give it to the mother of his child. 

They‚Äôve been married since, there is no child, and he‚Äôd try to reconnect with me every time he thought I might have coattails he could ride to the music career he‚Äôll never have. If he‚Äôd had any actual motivation, I would have been concerned about stalking."
206,The phosphors in laundry detergent are essentially black light paint so most times it‚Äôs detergent. Probably saw a few cum rag shirts though.
207,I bought a protein cookie once instead of my normal protein bar. The serving size was 1/2 a cookie.
208,"Forget the stomach, how the fuck are you supposed to raise a child when you wake up every morning not knowing they exist and can't remember a single fact about them? I know it's just a movie but that one really needed to be a childfree marriage."
209,"Instruction unclear, penis stuck in a book about objectification."
210,"My mother passed when I was ten and since then my dad raised me and older brother. 

I had no fashion sense when I was young, it wasn't until highschool when I started to care about what I wore to school and started to explore makeup. I had no women around me during these years so when I got my period, he kind of freaked but I got kind of some help from my neighbor (who was like 70 at the time...) 

The male stereotype affected me though. Emotions was not something we discussed in my house, my dad was always there for me but not the emotional part which has left me scared to show any emotions than happiness, even when my ex broke up with me he kind of just shrugged it off and said ""there will be more"". So I missed the empathy that would typically come from a woman. 

During recent years I explored my feminity more and more, but I have done it all by myself (with the help of YouTube and some... Other websites... You get my hint). I do agree with other comments that I connect more easily with men than women, but I don't think it affected me in a negative way, it just took a little bit longer for me to explore what it means to be a woman."
211,"Well, she went through another, much longer and more abusive marriage (about 15-ish years) and then lost about 150 pounds and then she lost another 300 or so when she ditched HB#2. She is now engaged to a delightful guy who adores her and treats her like a queen. Her adult children also like him and we're all going camping together next month. 

Sometimes you gotta crawl through some shit to get through to the other side you know."
212,I usually wait 10 months
213,"V for Vendetta. Great corny movie up until she literally falls even harder in love with him after he reveals he put her in his interrogation dungeon and tortured her personally for a months to prove ‚Äúshe would rat on him‚Äù or some shit like that. 

Also Love Actually. She kisses her husbands loser friend after he whines and she doesn‚Äôt pity him- no- she enjoys the kiss like he was her long lost love."
214,"Thanks for sharing this, i hate the whole idea that if its the right person you wont have any doubts"
215,"I love this feeling! When my husband just puts his hand on my back/waist to keep me close in a crowd. I think as women we are used to being on the alert and watching our own backs, so when a date acts in a protective way it‚Äôs so refreshing. At least that‚Äôs my theory."
216,That movie would have been great if it was a sci-fi horror thriller and it was from the perspective of J law's character.
217,Overboard. Yes it was hilarious. But how can this guy throw away his million dollar lifestyle for a woman who tricked him when he had amnesia to believe he was her husband and basically turned him into a slave until he regained his memory. How can someone possibly forgive another for something so awful and be in love with them somehow?
218,Any romance with Adam Sandler
219,"I was a nanny for a woman for two years, eventually she became a stay at home mom so I was no longer needed but we had a good relationship so I would still babysit for her on weekends and special occasions. She was a single mom, just off a divorce when I met her but eventually she began dating and got engaged to another man. This guy had three children of his own although they were much older than her kids. He had two college aged daughters and one 11 year old. 

When they moved in together the 11 year old was then included in the babysitting, which was fine, she was a good kid. But one day in the summer I was watching all the kids and the 11 year old gets a call on her phone from one of her older sisters. Okay no big deal until she comes out of her room and informs me that her sister said she could go spend the day with her and that her boyfriend was on his way to pick her up. So I'm just like ""Hold up. I wasn't told anything about you leaving. I have to get in contact with your parents first and make sure it's okay."" I didn't have the dads number, only the mom I worked for. Immediately she's telling me on the phone to absolutely not let her future stepdaughter leave. She continues that she doesn't know the boyfriend of the older girl and he isn't even allowed in the house. Well guess who shows up 5 minutes later? Yeah, the boyfriend. I have to go outside and tell him he can't come inside and the 11 year old can't leave with him. Of course he ends up calling his girlfriend who wants to talk to me over the phone, so I have to explain everything to her. She's pissed. The 11 year old is now crying her eyes out because I won't let her go and the boyfriend is just kinda standing in the front yard like ""wtf do I do now?"". Well I guess the older daughter gets ahold of her dad to complain, he relents that the 11 year old can go but only if she's the one that picks her up, not the boyfriend. Twenty minutes later she shows up, doesn't say a word to me, gives me the stink eye and takes her sister and goes. I'm just like, how the hell was any of that my fault? Plan things better or talk to your own family first, I'm just trying to do my job."
220,"We kept on going in circles. Wed break up and than have 3 months of bliss until it was back to hating eachother and starting over. I knew I didn't want to be with him like 6 months in but I still had crazy feelings for him. He told me one day that he would leave when we were fighting to make me beg for him and I was so mad. A couple weeks down the road we had a fight and he walked out, just like he always did, and I asked him to come back. He didnt so I told him we were over and to not come back. He didnt believe me because we had already dont this like 8 times but I was serious and never let him come back. Its been 4 years now and since that moment I've only seen him once so he could pick up his shit and leave. It took me two years to gain the confidence to get rid of him and I wasted 3ish years with him."
221,It could also just be anxiety
222,"It was multiple things. 

He wasn't afraid to put his arm around me during the movie. After the movie, we sat outside and talked for *hours*. Next thing we knew, it was about 1 am (movie ended around 8:30 or so). When we were walking to our cars (we drove separate), we said our goodbyes and I turned to walk to my car door, and he grabbed my hand and pulled me back into him and said, ""You didn't think I was going to leave without kissing you, did you?"" And then we kissed. 

We're married now."
223,"Current RA!

So all of my personal residents have been dolls for the past 2 years, but when on Duty dealing with other people‚Äôs....

-Zip-line from a Third Story Balcony

-6 foot long 4 foot deep pool set up in an apartment 

-37 year old in a freshman community drinking with minors

-Over $400 worth of alcohol confiscated 

-6 guys snap chatting and drinking on a public sidewalk

Like others, I have so many more and I‚Äôm happy to elaborate on any of the above stories! It‚Äôs been a crazy time but my residents are the reason I‚Äôm here!"
224,"I used to think that before I actually watched all through. I was actually really impressed with the different types of personalities, lifestyles, and goals each of these women had. I can see why it was huge in the late 90s/2000s.  Sam and Miranda were huge career motivators in my 20‚Äôs, and I actually really appreciated how these women never based their self worth on men."
225,"2 months in and I was head over heels in love with him. It came very softly. We were in a bookstore one night, wandering the shelves separately, and when I turned a corner to find him, I felt like I was finally ‚Äúhome‚Äù. I just knew in that moment, he was the one for me."
226,"He BEGGED for the date after I told him no, because his divorce wasn‚Äôt final, and I didn‚Äôt want to date someone in that stage. Against my better judgment, I told him I would meet him for coffee, but ONLY so he could vent about his divorce stuff. Having been divorced 2 years prior, I empathized with his need to vent. He changed location immediately when I arrived, because his divorce wasn‚Äôt final, and several of her friends were there. After telling me how he left the military because of discrimination he felt as a redhead, he told me I ‚Äúsmelled intoxicating‚Äù SEVEN times over the course of VERY painful conversation. When the date was over, he asked if I would come over to cuddle with him. When I emphatically replied that not only would I not, but that was our last date and no he could not have my phone number. He responded with ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it? You‚Äôre friendzoning me?‚Äù to which I laughed and said ‚Äúthat would imply that we‚Äôre friends. Then I drove around forever to make sure he couldn‚Äôt follow me and figure out where I live. No more pity coffee dates."
227,Free to do my own schedule. I can go to sleep at 6 om and wake up at 3 and no one complains
228,I'm apparently disgusting...
229,Not sure exactly how long would raise a red flag but this thread made me think of a lady I knew who kept saying she and her boyfriend of 10 years were going to get married.  They were both around 50 years old and he had kids but she didn‚Äôt.  She kept telling me they were planning to get married once his kids moved out and left home.  His kids were like 25 and 27 years old at the time.  He‚Äôd never given her a ring either.  It came as no surprise when I heard they‚Äôd broken up.  10 years and no clear signs he wants move forward is a damn long time.
230,"I had a mug with sugar a tea bag and an empty bowl on the counter side by side, and I broke eggs into the mug. With the tea bag in it."
231,"I imagine it as an annoying pop up ad and mentally click ""X"" and then give myself something else to do. Just like pop ups, it often comes back, and I have to ""click X"" again. But I don't take it as seriously when I think if it this way."
232,"My boyfriend at the time was getting his hair cut and afterwards his stylist took a look at me and said he knew exactly what cut I needed. That I was going to realize I'd spent my whole life looking for this cut. He was so enthusiastic and so certain that I was going to look incredible. My boyfriend urged me to go ahead. The stylist told me I couldn't hold back, had to let him go all the way with the cut. I kinda got swept up in their excitement and said ok.

An hour later I had very short, ridiculous hair. Instant regret followed by years of regret. I had to get it cut even shorter to fix his horrible cut. There are no photos of me for months after that. Four years later I still haven't gotten my hair back to where it was. Fuck that guy."
233,"That I was ""broken"" because I didn't get turned on when seeing him and maybe it was also because I had put on an extra 5kgs and that messed everything else up üôÑ"
234,Non existent. Just because they‚Äôre family doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not toxic!
235,Jokes on u I'm not wearing a bra atm
236,Took me a sec to realize you were talking about the remake. Although ... critique still works.
237,"This. I am a K-2 teacher and I need some silence when I get home. I also need some time where I'm not ""on"" and meeting the needs of others."
238,"It wasn‚Äôt exactly a first date. We were in the same friend group. But every time we would all get together, I felt he genuinely enjoyed my company and was interested in what I had to say. I could tell he thought I was attractive and we flirted, but didn‚Äôt make explicit comments about my looks until we started dating.  He made me feel so comfortable to be around him that it felt like we had known each other for years from the moment we met. It‚Äôs 11 months later and we are in love üíò"
239,"Weeping willow. Idk why really...  I always thought they look so beautiful and sad all at the same time. 

There was some at the local park, that lined the path up to this lookout tower thing, that I have no idea the actual purpose of. The tower was almost never open but I did go inside a few times and it offers a nice view

Anyway, these trees were fun to climb and hand out in as a child so I guess it‚Äôs nostalgia...  that‚Äôs why they are my favorite"
240,Bet that's an even bigger weight off your shoulders!
241,"Buying from my non-preferred menstrual product brands just because they are cheaper (like the store brands, for example). 

Absolutely not. 

I will buy my Always Infinity flex foam pads (fucking amazing, by the way. it's like my vagina is on a cloud. fuck yes flex foam) and Tampax Pearl until the day my vagina drips it's last drop of blood.

I will also buy Advil liquid gels until the day I die. You can't stop me."
242,"*using the force of sandpaper on wood* just ride it out , it'll feel good.....  I'd wring his dick and tell him the same . Idiot."
243,"So your feelings didn't really change during that time, either for the worse or the better? How do you keep yourself happy in this situation? (Honest question!)"
244,"Divorced just before year 3.
He quit his job a month before the wedding and didn‚Äôt seek any meaningful employment again, just expected me to work and keep house and take care of him while he laid in front of the tv and maxed out the credit cards."
245,"I had the exact same experience. Ended up leaving a three year relationship with someone I was crazy for because he finally admitted he didn't want marriage or children. In retrospect, there were tons of other red flags, but at the time I believed when he said he'd eventually 'come around'. We were both 24. I met my now fianc√© about 5 months later. He was 32 and we were both open with our desire to eventually marry and have children. We got engaged 1 year and 4 months later. Basically, when someone shows you who they are, believe them."
246,There was absolutely nothing romantic about it.  It just portrays a selfish man  who decides his happiness is worth more than a woman's future.
247,"Same, at my first ever job interview -.- at the evening my parents asked when it was happening. I just starred blank into their eyes and thought to myself ""shiiiiiit-"""
248,"Joined mid-year as an RA to an upperclassmen floor. A resident on my floor hadn‚Äôt been seen in a while and I did a wellness check on her. Knocked on the door, no answer. Keyed in to the room after three attempts to get an answer. Found an empty room except for two full, black trash bags and a broken mirror in the middle of the room. Nothing else there. 

I never found out what exactly happened, although my hall directors never seemed concerned after I brought it up so I assumed they knew more than I did about it."
249,"I hear bi women are allowed to answer!

For me a definite sign of a crush is when my heart rate goes crazy. There was a time when I was having my heartrate checked by a really cute nurse and she made me so nervous that I had to be deferred. I'm usually around 70 or 80 bpm. I was over 100 bpm.

There are other things. My mouth gets dry. I start sweating. I try not to look at them but I keep on looking at them. 

I try to find excuses to run into them again. Etc."
250,I spent a solid 10 minutes looking for my phone the other day whilst I was in my hand ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I even turned the torch on it to look under the bed üôàüôàüôà.
251,"If you have a child who is on the autism spectrums, for fucks actual sakes WHY WOULDNT YOU TELL ME? You shitty fucking excuse for a mother. How the hell am I supposed to keep your child happy and safe if you hide the fact that he has communication tools from me?

I hope your kids were taken from you, I really do."
252,"One: not on my hall but on a friend‚Äôs: some resident every couple of days would buy a rotisserie chicken, eat some of it, and throw it away in the hall trash. People complained all the time about the smell making them hungry and about it being kinda gross. Not sure what happened in the end lol

Two: not so much a weird resident as a weird experience. I call it the Blood Incident. Basically, when I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth one morning, the bathroom was COVERED in blood. I‚Äôm talking a box of bloody paper towels, blood smears on the wall, blood around the sink, bloody footprints. Turned out not to be murder, but getting campus safety to come clean it up as a biohazard was shockingly hard"
253,"When you hang out with friends, most of the time you're not talking about your love life. You're talking about funny things that happened recently, current events, weird ideas that popped into your head, financial matters, work projects, new things you've tried recently, ambitions, general life anxieties, the best place to buy a replacement for your broken item and whether or not that store holds sales, etc. 

A lot of media makes it seem like all our conversations revolve around our appearance and dudes."
254,"As a 6'0 tall woman, I feel that. It took me well into my mid-twenties before I learned to feel good about my height and not like I was the antithesis of all things feminine. I also married a wonderful man who doesn't give a shit about height, so it all works out."
255,"Like 3 months. Nothing specific, we both just knew. We are celebrating our 17th anniversary of being together this week."
256,It's literally designed to break down when wet.
257,"I picked up a package of [frozen pot stickers](https://www.pagodasnacks.com/products/potstickers-pork.htm). The serving size is 3 pieces. That's not really a big deal except that the number of servings per package is 3.5 ..... but when you open the box there are 2 plastic bags of pot stickers (so unless you read the back of the box, you might be inclined to think each bag is one serving, when in reality each bag is 1 3/4 serving).

There's a lot of this kind of trickery. If your package of bread lists the serving size in grams instead of slices, weigh the slice (it'll probably weigh more than the serving amount listed)."
258,"I nannied for my dad's friend the summer after I graduated high school. I worked every other week from 7 am to 5 pm for $8 an hour. At least it was supposed to be 5 pm. Oftentimes he wouldn't get home until 7 or 8 and he'd have no explanation or apology. Attempts to reach him on these cases were futile, he'd just turn off his phone. I was young and too timid to do anything about it at that time.

There was one day however that I really needed to get out by 5 pm to attend my friends birthday dinner. I asked him a week in advance if he could please make sure to get back at the agreed upon time and he said sure. My dad even called him about it to get the message across that it was important. The day before and day of I reminded him I needed to leave at 5 pm. He said of course he'd be there. 5 pm comes around and no sign of him. 5:10 I try and call and no answer of course. I was so beyond over it that I loaded up the kid, and dropped her off at her grandma's house that was 10 minutes away and left. I left a voicemail telling him what I did. The next day he acted like nothing happened. 

He was also going through a divorce at this time and forbid his daughter from contacting her mother on the week he had her. He went so far as to block the mother's number on his daughters phone and check her phone every night to make sure she didn't contact her. I honestly hated this asshole at this point so I unblocked the mother's number, let the girl call her every day and taught her how to delete the call log so her father couldn't see it. 

The next summer he called and asked me to nanny and I pretty much told him to go fuck himself and that I'd never let someone treat me the way he did again. My dad backed me up and it severed their friendship I think. I felt bad for the girl cuz she was in such a shitty situation with a terrible father and while I did have fun with her there was no way in hell I was going back."
259,"it is *so weird* to meet this person and have it be a ''date'' when you don't know them at all. even if you find someone who says they're cool with starting slow and getting to know each other, it was my experience that they basically already think of you as a new girlfriend/lay by the time you meet and there's no cutting through that awkwardness."
260,Keep him forever. Anyone who appreciates The Princess Bride should be revered.
261,"Yesterday I was asking my boyfriend, ""... Where's my phone? Uhhhh... where is my phone??"" and I realized I was holding it in my left hand LOL. To be fair I was holding my purse in my right hand and I feel the weight of my purse to check if my phone was in there, which it wasn't."
262,"It's kind of amazing to go back through these movies I watched as a young teen and young adult, and realize just how fucked up those situations would be in real life. Overboard is one that got mentioned. Holy cow that is a messed up movie when you look at it."
263,"On her paperwork under medical conditions she wrote ‚Äúpregananant‚Äù

268,"GOD YOU GONNA CALL ME ON MY SHIT IN PUBLIC LIKE THIS?

So I have like 6 bras. I‚Äôve definitely gone over a month without washing any of them. I try not to actively wear any bra for more than a week without washing. The fact that I have several and can air them out for multiple days between wears helps a lot."
269,Agreed.  Nothing wrong with OKing it at your own wedding but make it REALLY FUCKIN OBVIOUS you did (maybe even introduce them) just so everyone knows they‚Äôre not an idiot which would honestly be the first presumption most people have.
270,"It‚Äôs amazing for me. Way more comfortable than tampons, and yeah more convenient because I don‚Äôt have to buy anything and it lasts longer between changing it. I don‚Äôt feel it at all when it‚Äôs in, to the point that I have to be careful to make a deliberate habit of changing it or else I can forget that it‚Äôs in and forget I‚Äôm on my period entirely. 

There are no current cons for me. It‚Äôs honestly the best thing that ever happened to me. Made my period such a non-issue. I switched 10 years ago and would never, ever go back. I had to use one tampon a few months ago when I got surprised out without my cup, and... my god I can‚Äôt believe I used to like tampons.

The only con I guess is there is a steep learning curve and it took me awhile to learn how to insert and remove it, at one point I gave up out of frustration. But once I got the hang of it, it became a breeze."
271,Pretending I had different interests or that I didn‚Äôt like something as much as I actually did.
272,"While filling a form yesterday I misspelled my own name, and wrote that I was born in 1919, on a wrong month.... 

My brain sort of shut down."
273,"That he wants to put his seed in me and make babies. Gross enough when it's uttered by a stranger, but it was also in all my dating profiles that I do not want to have children, so that tells me that either he didn't read my profile, or he read it and doesn't care."
274,"So I decided to anger myself and went to MGTOW to see what was up. There was a post about how woman who have sex with multiple men before they‚Äôre 30s aren‚Äôt woman you what to marry because they gave sex away for free why you have to pay for it with time, gifts, etc. 

I almost went blind, either you want woman to have sex with your or you don‚Äôt lol so who do you hate women in relationships having sex or woman who aren‚Äôt in relationships having sex? It was so confusing."
275,"It‚Äôs truly amazing how hairless young men expect women to be. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. My old high school bf legit put his hand down my pants and the second he felt pubes he retracted his hand in shock. And I‚Äôm like, yea! Pubes! They‚Äôre a thing!"
276,"They were good kids, but you could tell they simply couldn't relax because of their mom. I used to think that when they got their first taste of freedom (going to college, etc.) they would go crazy from finally being free.  I hope their dad helped them mellow out!"

280,"He‚Äôs in charge of the entertainment, then"
281,Yep! At 7 years old my dad got full custody of me and it has in so many ways shaped who i am today. When my friends meet my dad they understand me better which is kind of fun. When it‚Äôs related to femininity I know I lack a lot of emotional drive. I tend to be more logical or I have issues being emotional. I don‚Äôt like being emotional in front of anyone.. not even my husband. As an adult I know there is nothing wrong with it but I still struggle with being that vulnerable with anyone but myself. I would say I am not the super feminine type and feel way more comfortable in sweats and a hoodie. I can actually do my makeup pretty well but I don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs like if I want to be super feminine I can be but my conformability is more with being casual and relaxed. What I like about how my dad raised me is i felt like he raised me as a human and not as a girl. I never felt limited being a girl when I was younger.
282,"Well, when my boss raped me, I said it was rape, and he said I was a whore."

286,"I love to read. It's basically a hobby for me, and it's a great way for me to decompress after work.

As soon as I get home from work, I change into comfy clothes, grab a snack and read my book for at least an hour. It's wonderful."
287,This!! I'm planning on having no one officially but maybe inviting a couple of friends (guys and gals!) to do finishing touches with me and have a cocktail beforehand. Low key but leaves me without any pressure.

293,"If we've moved in together and they aren't enthusiastic about the idea of getting married and won't agree to a timeline, then it becomes clear that they probably aren't that into the idea. I mean, avoiding the topic altogether is kind of a red flag in itself unless you're asking about getting married after like, a month or something. Someone can want to marry you but be on a different timeline and also be willing to have the discussion instead of avoiding it."
294,"After 4.5 years I came to the unconscious realization that nothing would ever change. I knew this with absolute certainty. It wasn‚Äôt even a choice- like choosing to leave him. There was just this moment I knew I HAD to. and I fought it emotionally, because at the time I still ‚Äúloved‚Äù him but I knew m life would be forever miserable if I stayed."
295,"Ugh, and I wanna bet that the reason they try to befriend you is because they don't wanna pay. So they try to make you give it to them for close to free."

313,"&gt;Held my hand while making me walk on the inside from the road 

My coworker had me walk on the inside from the road once in a bad part of town and it blew my mind. I didn't realize it was a thing, but it felt so comforting. In my case there was nothing at all romantic there, he's just a super caring and respectful guy. But damn it did feel nice! It was a really great balance of watching out for you without being too creepy about it."
314,"Was doing inspections, and ready for just about anything.  Lots of stuff I expected - underage drinking, ""illegal"" pets, a giant jar full of roaches (not those kind of roaches - [these](https://www.theweedstreetjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10541DSCF8120.jpg) kinds), whatever.

This one place, though.  This I wasn't expecting.  The whole damn apartment was full of fast food wrappers.  Next to the bed was a pile of quizzno's soda cups's that went higher than the desk.  On the desk were quizznos wrappers, one on top of the other.  The whole place was just... a degree of trash I've never seen before.  Even movies had never gone to such levels of grossness.  They were good kids, clearly struggling with some mental health issues, but I will happily take the loud, obnoxious drunk party than dealing with a place like that again.

Oh and a fun aside - first weekend of the school year, a girl screeched into the parking lot without a wheel - not a flat tire, but the whole damn wheel was missing, sparks flying everywhere.  Right across the street was a dunkin donuts and - get this - there was a cop in the drive through üòÇ.  It went right past res life and straight to the cops, I didn't have to deal with it, thank god.  She was so trashed she didn't even notice the sparks.  Her car was a fuckin' firework and she didn't notice.

Oh man, res life never got boring, that's for sure.  It was fun, would recommend."
315,"I always heard that relationships were hard and that they are constant work and so I assumed this about my relationship with my first boyfriend. I just kept plugging along and fighting to make it work because it was what I believed I had to do. After 4 years I realized I wasn't in love, I was unhappy and I wanted out. I spent 3 years single after that just getting to know myself and casually dating. I eventually met my now husband and learned how wrong I was about my previous way of thinking. Sure, any relationship will have its ups and downs and disagreements but it should never feel like it's constant work or that it's a hard uphill battle. I learned that just means you're incompatible and you should move on."

322,"A systematic change I've noticed in the past ~5 years:


It seems like ever since Tinder &amp; such have gotten big, the concept of being ""exclusive"" has become way more demonized and blown up than it used to be. It seems like before then, if two people hit it off and liked each other, they would become a couple within a few dates without a problem. Now, people expect you to have a period of being ""non-exclusive"", even if you're not actually seeing others and it takes serious foot-dragging being an official couple. It's like people overthink being in a relationship. And people make a big deal about ""labels."" Like, YES I WANT A LABEL. I want to know if we're a couple or not. It's not psychotic or clingy to want to know where we stand."

326,"Prior to getting married and having kids, I lived alone for 3 years. The best part? Being able to go to the bathroom, shower, get dressed and brush my teeth in peace. I love my husband and kids but I would love one morning where there wasn‚Äôt a crisis and I could go to the bathroom without a small hand appearing under the door or one of them yelling ‚ÄúMom, mom, mom, mom....‚Äù

I wore a gorgeous braided red wig. No one was able to tell it was a wig. Man or woman. And I got loads of compliments. What's on your head. Does. Not. Matter.

333,"I have a memory of a woman babysitting me having a pet pot bellied pig. Not one of those cute teacup ones, a massive black pig. This was on your average housing estate, so pretty unusual. I'd mentioned it to my sister (who would have been with me), and she has no recollection of a woman with a giant pet pig looking after us after school.

So one family dinner we thought to ask our mum who was right. Turns out there was a woman with a giant pig! Mum also mentioned she also had a severely disabled adult daughter - at this my sister perked up. She remembered all about the daughter, nothing about the pig. Whereas to this day I have 0 memory of that daughter. Memory is a funny thing."
334,"Tbh it was once I saw him interact with his son (I think it was 3-4 months into our relationship). He is a hard working single father and put his son before himself. Watching him discipline, interact, get lunch for his son...I knew I wanted to marry this man."
335,Yes because every period is the same lol so much
336,"As someone in their 40's who hasn't dated in over 20yrs, this thread is depressing."
337,"About 5 months in, but I knew it was for good when we both lost our jobs within months of each other (less than a year into our relationship). We were both home all the time, stressed to the max, and yet we never fought, we never took our stress out on one another, and fully supported each other through it all. 

&gt;What convinced you that this is THE ONE?

When I was told a friend that the relationship was comfortable. I felt secure, confident, and relaxed when he was around. I never felt like I had to put on a show, be someone else, or work for his affection. I likened it to ""Feeling like I'd just crawled into the most comfortable bed, with fresh sheets."" It's warm, cozy, and safe."
338,"Former RA -- where to start?

1 - The two residents who each had a single room, put all of their furniture and belongings in one room, and the other room *we think* was a drug lab. The lights were always off, weird odor, they wore hazmat suits and rubber gloves and were only in there between midnight and 6am. 

2 - Girl who also chose to live alone.  Entire room was filled with Pokemon toys and blow up dolls.

3- The farm boy who didn't understand why he couldn't grow marijuana plants in his dorm room.  They were just small plants and he was an ag major!

4 -  The girl who disobeyed the pet policy, had a pet snake in her dorm room anyway --  her heat lamp set the building on fire.  Her room was destroyed but luckily not a ton of damage to the rest of the building (the fire department was across the street so they arrived quickly).  Her boyfriend was also in a pyramid scheme but was adamant it was NOT a pyramid scheme.

5 - the fellow who broke a glass beer bottle in the parking lot, stepped on it, and bled, making it easy for us to follow his bloody footprints.  The prints led us to the boys bathroom where he was drinking *another* beer, in a lawn chair, fully clothed, in a non-running shower. 

6 - The two girls who were using a kitchen available in the basement of the residence hall.  They had put non-dishwasher soap in the dishwasher and it flooded the entire basement.  When I went downstairs and was ankle deep in water, asking for their help to vacuum it out, they pretended they didn't speak English/couldn't understand me and walked out of the building.  A week later I passed them speaking perfect English outside.

Caught him lying to me again (over something so small and stupid)....that was it for me. I can‚Äôt take the lies no more. If you can‚Äôt be honest about small things you will never be honest about serious things. I gave that man everything and I was so in love with him.

348,"And remember, the sex worker is a magical unicorn sex worker .. a literal streetwalker who doesn't do drugs and doesn't have a horrific back story and is just a gosh darn cute, intelligent, healthy woman down on her luck and all she needed was a rich man to treat her like a 4yo to realize it!! 

Watch the movie and realize that in pretty much every non-sex scene, Julia Roberts character can be replaced by a 4yo girl and the scene still plays out exactly the same

* She doesn't know how to dress, daddy has to help her get dressed and put on a party dress

* She doesn't know how to use a fork or how to order in a restaurant. Daddy has to teacher ""Now this is how you do this. . you say hi to this man over there and this man is the waiter and . .. . "" 

* She throws a temper tantrum and he has to calm her down the same way a dad would talk to his 4yo daughter. 

Soooo many movies from the 80s and early 90s and earlier portray the ""ideal woman"" as the body of a 21yo supermodel with the mind and emotions of a 4yo girl. Like men want to fuck a 4yo with tits. It's so gross."

350,"I missed a final job interview by a full day. I had previously had a phone interview with their search committee and an in-person interview with the person that would supervise me. All I had left was the final interviews with the search commitee and a few key stakeholders.

The appointment was on Tuesday. I had written down Wednesday, so that's when I showed up. They must have seen the look of pure panic in my face...I can't act. They basically said, ""bye!"" I understand that they couldn't just drop what they were doing to interview me, but I wss hoping that they would reschedule. Nope.

I really wanted this job. It was a job in my field. I was looking forward to using my knowledge to help change a few things that they were struggling with. I was looking forward to working with kids again (I had been working with college students prior). I was so disappointed in myself."
351,Which one? Longest I've gone is about 2 weeks unless we're talking about my sports bras that I wear to work and I wash those ever time I wear one.
352,"This is so important. When my ex and I broke up it was for a variety of reasons. He was so fucked on drugs all the time and going through a court case too that he let go of reality. Me, his friends, his family... it's like we all lost him. He became the most toxic person in my life. I couldn't even break it off, I waited until he did. I just couldn't let go of this idea of the wonderful boy I had fallen in love with when he just didn't exist. 

It took me too long to get over it but I'm not with my amazing current boyfriend who just couldn't be better, so everything ended up fine :) OP, if you're going through a tough time just try to remember that it's not gonna be like this forever"
353,"I wasn't a babysitter. I was a carer for children at risk of harm (anything from parents going through drug treatment, siblings with high needs meaning parents couldn't spend much time with the other children, not necessarily ""bad"" parents, just people who needed an extra set of hands). It was drilled in to us ""you're not a babysitter, you're never to be alone with the children, you're meant to be helping the parents"". 
I got placed with triplets who were premis, their mum has post natal depression, and spoke English as a second language. (Farsi was her main language, which I don't speak).
I did everything I could to help the babies and ease the workload for their mum. Often their mum would leave, and I couldn't go look for her because I had three babies to watch. So sometimes I would have to do things like change nappies, which we were discouraged from doing for legal reasons, but I wasn't about to let a baby sit in a dirty nappy while I waited for their mum to return. 
One day their grandma was visiting, and she sat with one of the babies while I took two of them into the yard to get some fresh air. As I walked past the mum's room, I see her sitting on her bed scrolling through Facebook. Another time I see her napping. One time I show up and the carer from the previous shift is still there because mum had gone to get her hair and nails done. 
All this is being put in to my weekly reports to the company, and before my shift one day I get a call saying I have to tell this woman that she can't treat me like a babysitter. 
I get to my shift, and I say, very nicely, that the company is really pushing that carers can't be alone with children in case something happens to one of the children, I make sure I'm not using blame language, etc. Then she goes off. Screaming at me at the top of her lungs. All three babies start crying, she ignores them. She calls the company and starts lying to them, saying I am on my phone during work, saying I am always changing the kids nappies (I have done it twice in the 4 months I worked with her), saying I never follow her instructions, that I'm sloppy and rude. The whole time this is happening, I am trying to distract and entertain 3 screaming babies. 
Eventually, my shift ends and I leave, and immediately get a call from my manager. Apparently I'm not the first carer this has happened to, and apparently this mother hasn't been going to see her post natal psychologist (which was a term of her contract). 
After that (and a few more run-ins doing disability care) decided I didn't want to work that closely with parents, and now I'm training to be a teachers aide.
I love working with kids but a lot of parents can be incredibly entitled and cruel towards carers and educators."

355,"From what I can tell from stories my mother (in her 50‚Äôs) has told me it‚Äôs not much different, she has a lot of stories of guys that were gross, creepy, or manipulative, I think it‚Äôs just that women are more comfortable calling it out now."
356,"Not sure if bi people are allowed to answer but I won‚Äôt really talk about my romantic life with her unless it‚Äôs mentioning how incredibly single I am (because she‚Äôs obviously the focus of it), test out the ‚Äúplatonic‚Äù hug or handholding trick, and also sharing songs that ‚Äújust made me think of you.‚Äù

362,"My mother‚Äôs going through that right now. Dad fucked off with his missus who‚Äôs 4.5 years older than me. He‚Äôs been cheating on her since I was born (over 20 years now). It‚Äôs a struggle for her, we‚Äôre first generation immigrants so she‚Äôs got limited contact with other people as well. On top of this, we‚Äôre not well off economically, and we‚Äôve been informed he has enough to pay for a year‚Äôs rent and after we‚Äôre to fend for ourselves. 

Mum grieved and felt sorry for herself for over a year. Almost every night she‚Äôd cry, she‚Äôd disappear randomly, had severe mood swings and would sometimes lose her temper at the most mild things at me or my sister. It was hard on her. She still gets really hung up on it now, and you can tell it affects her a lot still (doesn‚Äôt help that she likes to make semi-depressed comments like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be happy and I‚Äôll always be alone‚Äù). 

Things have improved for her this year though, and I think the biggest change is effort. Mum grieved for a year, and still has random depressive moments every few days. But a lot has changed for her this year, she‚Äôs expanded her social circle (has coffee with a family friend once a week), goes to another friend‚Äôs house to chat and cook together and has started TAFE (which in Australia offers non-tertiary education to people so they can qualify for jobs, learn english etc.). 

From my perspective (given that I‚Äôm only turning 21 next month so am still very young), I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs simply working on yourself. I told my mother that life‚Äôs shit. And you have to accept that. But what you don‚Äôt have to and shouldn‚Äôt accept is that there‚Äôs nothing you can do to help yourself. You chip away at the things that are hurting you or stressing you bit by bit. Financially, we were struggling a lot so my sister and I helped mum with government assistance. Socially, mum took up English classes and has made an effort to see more of our family friends whilst making new ones in the process. Physically, mum‚Äôs started going to gym classes and the like, exercise and the endorphins definitely do help.

I guess in the end, it was just working on what little things you can work on. And improving what you can improve. Mum still gets very lonely and upset sometimes but she‚Äôs in a much better place now than she was a year ago. And that‚Äôs key.

Tldr because I wrote an essay; 

Mum worked on the little things that she could work on. Things that were stressing her or making her upset. When your mind‚Äôs in a better place then you can tackle those more complex feelings of missing dickheads that don‚Äôt deserve you."
363,"Haha I only found out that notion was wrong when it actually happened to me. My first time didn‚Äôt have any of that and it didn‚Äôt hurt as much as I expected, so I was really...confused. I only found a little, veeeeeery little blood when later I was in the bathroom. I was shocked haha (but the guy was absolutely a sweetheart to me)"
364,"I went out with a guy as friends last night and he text me within 30 minutes of getting home asking me on a proper date and I was so excited, so in conclusion, waiting to text is bullshit"
365,He brought his kids.
366,"Made it all the way to work, parked my car, realized I had forgotten to put on a bra."
367,Alpha women always get their period during a full moon.
368,"Third date. 

&gt;What convinced you that this is THE ONE?

I felt very comfortable and many boxes were ticked, he was very close to the man of my dreams and in some aspects even better than my imaginations. I knew what I was looking for and voila he came along. 

That was 14 years ago. We have 3 kids now and got married last year. 

He's not perfect but neither am I. But we'll hold on to each other till we're old and grey. He's calm, we only fight with words and respectfully, we trust each other, no alcohol, drugs nor cigarettes, he's never acting awkwardly, very patient, list could go on for a while."
369,"everythinggggg. date 1 was perfect. one part that stands out was on the way home, he asked if i was in any hurry and when i said no he slowed down (from 75 to 65) and said ‚Äúgood, i can make this last longer‚Äù and i just remember that moment being so sweet. ugh i cant wait to see him again."
370,"I really hated the notebook for this. So, this couple have a wee fling in their teens and then for years this guy sends letters to the woman multiple times a week that she never receives. She goes on with her life, meets a nice enough dude, has a relationship for years with him and gets engaged. While this is happening the guy from the fling has gone to war, watched friends die and still bases all his decisions in life around winning over this one girl from his teens, even spending a fortune to build her dream house. The girl sees this dude from her past and the house in a paper and immediately goes off to fuck him behind her fianc√©e's back. The message being if you're a guy who's interested in a woman who's already taken then just throw some money at making something for her and she'll be begging for the dick, to hell with the life and relationships she's already built.  


This is romantic apparently..."
371,I had a fwb of over a year tell me that the reason he couldn‚Äôt date me was because I was too fat. He had no problems fucking me multiple times a week for a year though.
372,"Any movie where someone is literally about to get married and they start having a full on romantic relationship/start falling in love with their partner's best friend. If you are about to get married, especially in the romantic throes of wedding planning, there is no fucking way you would EVER be having eyes for another woman/man. There are random assholes who cheat on their Bachelor or Bachelorette party night, but that's a rare story. Most people who get married are in deep romance and they would never just ""fall in love"" with another person weeks before their wedding"
373,"Porn in the internet age has had many weird affects on society, but one that I think never get discussed is how many dudes with large dicks think they don‚Äôt have to do anything during sex. They think showing up with a pretty penis is enough.

Like dude, no."
374,"Everything on a schedule. Working out is a priority but I only do it from 5-6 am. I have to shower but it can only be for 6 minutes. My makeup takes me 4 minutes. Blow drying takes 7, if I choose to curl then I have to move my schedule up by 5 minutes. I know what I‚Äôm wearing the night before and know where it‚Äôs all hanging or folded.  After those necessities are finished, I can either eat or work. If I choose to work, I make sure to pack my meal-prepped lunch plus an apple."
375,I've lived my whole damn life wondering if something's weird with my dealio and I have never once thought of it in those terms. Thank you.
376,"I've been counting calories for a few months now and while I knew this practice existed I was shocked when I got bamboozled myself. Sandwich from trader joes - 250 cal per serving. Which, if you squint, you'll see is only half a sandwich. üò°"
377,"My sister was complaining about period-pains and her male friand said that he could understand her because his male doctor told him his stomac pains were similar to period pains...

First of all, when someone is in pain they don't need to know you had also pain once in your life. And second of all, which kind of doctor compares pains like that? Especially when they never experienced it in their entire life?"
378,"‚ÄúWe know who we want to cater the wedding so‚Äù

ü§£ dying, love it"
379,"It's because they're written by dudes, and dudes think women's lives revolve around them."
380,"He said nothing. NOTHING. I guess I could have screened him better. We had texted a little beforehand, but I hate texting, so I ask to meet in-person fairly quick. I don‚Äôt know if he had serious anxiety issues and clammed up, or got high beforehand or what, but it was excruciating. I found it even more painful than the guys who won‚Äôt shut up. I asked for the check early and paid for the whole thing just to get out of there faster."
381,"I had a coworker who started echoing me. Eating what I ate, when I ate. Wearing the same shoes, and clothing styles, and decided her favourite color was the same as mine. Stopped wearing makeup because I don‚Äôt, and then started buying my skincare brand. She would wait in places she knew I would be, so she could ambush me. She would ask to try on my jewellery, then take pictures of herself wearing it. When she cut her hair so we ‚Äúcould be twins!‚Äù I went from mildly disturbed to creeped out.

Fortunately my boss had also noticed, and when I mentioning quitting before she killed me and hid my body in her closet, my boss forced a transfer to another office for her."
382,"I was at the bar with my husband and a few friends once, and I walked in the bathroom and there was a very drunk girl wearing a romper looking desperate and squirming and softly crying. 

She saw me and said ""FINALLY I've been waiting for someone to walk in for like 10 minutes please you have to help me""

""Uh sure what's wrong, are you ok?""

""Can you help me with my zipper? Please help me I need to take a massive shit and I'm already turtling please""

So I helped her, did my business and walked out. Later she saw me and came up and gave me a huge hug and her number, and now she's a pretty good friend. And that's the story of the first friend I've made in at least 10 years."
383,"A male OB/GYN told me that menstrual cramps don't hurt.  Well, between the two of us, I've actually had them and they suck hardcore, so...."
384,"In a similar instance, I kept smelling rotten onions one afternoon. Now before when I had smelled this, my dog had been peeing on my brown living room rug and I had never noticed. It ended up smelling like rotten onions for some reason and that is how I figured out he had been doing that.

So this week when I smelled it again I got all crazy and was on my hands and knees smelling the carpet and rugs. I couldn‚Äôt find a point where it was coming from. I give up and keep going on with my day, still smelling that smell. Then it dawns on me, I‚Äôm wearing the same comfy shirt I wore the previous night when I cooked dinner. I used onion and garlic in the dinner and it had gotten onto my shirt. Soon as I changed the smell was gone. I was so relieved it wasn‚Äôt from my dog peeing in the house again! I did feel pretty silly though."
385,"I actually laughed like a psycho at this!  ""THAT ONE NIGHT, you made everything all right!"""
386,"My ex boyfriend and I were in ROTC at the same time (at different colleges) and I was struggling. So he basically told me that it was fine if I didn‚Äôt join because I would of been an house wife eventually. He proceeded to get worse as time went on, basically treated me like a second class citizen."
387,"Copenhagen. A big city full of things to do, but still feels small and easy to navigate. Very safe, very clean, and unemployment is low. Everyone speaks English, the foody scene is awesome, you can bike everywhere. Come join us, it's a great place to live."
388,"My husband and I watched a couple of these movies while we were drunk, and my husband would loudly say, ‚ÄúWhat a dick!‚Äù every single time Christian said something. How do people take these movies seriously? It‚Äôs not romantic, it‚Äôs a textbook abusive relationship."
389,"Wait, you guys wash your bras?"
390,"tbh if I were a parent I would be uncomfortable with my older daughter's college aged boyfriend, who I don't know yet, picking up my 11 year old alone."
391,"Beef cake? Sure. Cross country bod? I‚Äôll take it. Bit of chub? Sign me up. As long as they like themselves and are within a healthy range it‚Äôs all good. 

A nice booty is prime real estate tho"
392,"Thank you! I was happy to be out of an abusive relationship and every time I told someone they looked at me with such pity, they were always so sad. I was fuckin pumped!"
393,"No shit. My friends text me 5 minutes later, on the way home, thanking me and letting they had a good time.  It‚Äôs nice.  Why do you need to play some useless game?"
394,I had one of my friends do my hair (very simple braid) and we shared a tiny bottle of sparkling apple juice before the wedding and it was such a fond memory. I have some nice photos of it and her boyfriend helping me put on my false eyelashes because I couldn‚Äôt get them on right!
395,"My bf and I are talking about getting engaged and married and I told him I want to choose a ring together. He asked if that wouldn‚Äôt ruin the surprise, but I am very picky about what I wear and since I don‚Äôt own any jewelry I‚Äôm not sure he would know what style I would like (not totally sure myself honestly.) in my opinion the proposal itself can be a surprise but the ring and the plan in general to get engaged should not be."
396,"I would like a dance to Beethoven's 9th symphony, please"
397,"Putting water in shampoo, conditioner, and body wash is totally my thing.  The secret is to do it when the bottles are a little more than half way empty and then again when they‚Äôre pretty much empty.  The products can last for weeks longer doing this.  That being said, *putting water in ketchup is egregious.*"
