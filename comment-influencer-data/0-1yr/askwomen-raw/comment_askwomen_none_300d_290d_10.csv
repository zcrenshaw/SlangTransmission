0,I waited until fifteen minutes before the new season of game of thrones started to change the password on my hbo account that I knew he was still using.
1,"Was in a relationship for two years, two years too long. He was an abusive alcoholic that was lovingly manipulative when sober. 
Broke up with him after having to call the police on him after a rather rough night. Two weeks later and I'm staying strong, telling him he has to be sober for at least a year before I would ever consider giving him another chance. For the first time I stuck to my no, which was new for him and he very much so did not like it.
Que him then spilling that he had been cheating on me for two months anyways with a girl he had sworn he was just friends with. 
Two months later I'm going through a junk drawer of mine and I found I still had his spare car key. I am not an angry person day to day and I honestly don't even wish anything bad towards him.
 I did however move his car two blocks every morning for a week. And on the last day, after what I'm sure was a week of being late to work and feeling on the verge of insanity, I left his car where he had parked it. I did also though turn the volume to max and move everything movable slightly.
Do I think it was healthy? Not really but it did fucking feel great "
2,"Everything has opportunity costs. 

If you want a partner that looks ‚Äúput together‚Äù or ‚Äúpretty,‚Äù but consider yesterday‚Äôs jeans and a t-shirt ‚Äúpresentable‚Äù for yourself, they‚Äôre probably going to have to spend more time getting ready than you do. 

If you want a partner who‚Äôs ‚Äúfit‚Äù or thin, they‚Äôre probably going to spend time at the gym and watch what they eat. 

If you want a partner who can have lots of interesting conversations, they‚Äôre probably going to spend a fair amount of time reading and educating themselves, and sometimes they‚Äôll probably go on about stuff you really don‚Äôt care about. 

If you want a partner who can fix things around the house, their tools are probably going to take up more space than you expected. 

And so on. It‚Äôs not hard to find partners who don‚Äôt ‚Äútake a long time to get ready‚Äù or who aren‚Äôt fussy about what they eat. They‚Äôre just probably not going to look exactly like people who do. Shit takes effort. If you expect people to roll out of bed looking like people you see in movies (who are selected for little other than their appearance, and who spend hours getting prepped and polished by multiple people each day anyway), you‚Äôre in for disappointment. "
3,"In 2010, I found out my fianc√© had been having an affair with our neighbor (for the past six months), 2 weeks before our wedding. His best man broke down and told me.

For 8 years, I have been giving creepy dudes my ex‚Äôs phone number instead of mine. His sister always texts me his new phone number when he changes it. She also sends photos and video of him losing his mind angry when he gets a call from a dude looking for a hookup. üòÇ

His sister is the real MVP here, though."
4,"The Ex cheated on me after 12 years with someone he met at work. When that went sour he lost his job and ended up falling behind on his car payment. The repo company had my place as his last known address, so when they showed up here looking for the car I invited them in, used Facebook to get them as much info on The Ex and New Girlfriend as possible, gave them his parent's address and sent them on their way with a smile. "
5,"I hope I'm not too late to this, but I loosened the seams in all his pants and shorts so that as soon as he sat they'd rip open on him. It's been 10 years and that still makes me laugh"
6,"Thank you for asking this question! I think this might be my all-time biggest pet peeve. You‚Äôre so grossed out by public toilet seats that you need to hover, but then *you leave your own fucking pee there and contribute to the grossness of the thing you‚Äôre too fucking good for?!* Seriously? Seriously."
7,"I broke up with someone who, as it turned out, was cheating on me anyway. Even still, he did not take it well. First, he showed up at my parent's house, where I was staying. I hadn't told my dad about the breakup yet, and I'd only been dating this person for about 6-8 weeks, so I didn't even think it was that important to mention. Should have though! My dad invited him in, and to stay for dinner. Sure, fine. I reminded him we were still broken up, and that was that.

The next day! The very next day! Said man calls me, and tells me that he's on his way to meet my family and me at the beach. I asked him why, seeing as we broke up. He insisted that no, we didn't break up, it was just a misunderstanding. He ended up driving 4 hours, with two bags full of groceries, to meet my family and me. This time, I was smart. I let people in on what was going on.

As I said, four hours later, this idiot shows up on my parents' doorstep. He quietly lets himself in to our house, and starts unpacking his shit in my room. I went upstairs, and reminded him, for the THIRD time now, that we were broken up, and what he was doing was super fucking weird. He stormed out, grabbed the groceries on his way, slammed a door in my face, and then threw the groceries at my dad. My uncle, a veteran four times over, saw what he did. He reminded him of his place, and sent him well on his way. Angry texts ensued.

After that? This jackass and his doting mother spent six months harassing me. She sent me a bible, with her favorite passages highlighted. She told me that she highlighted them in hopes that they would 'save' me, and bring me back to her son. As for her son? He sent my parents, my grandmother, and myself very long letters, giving insight in to the more intimate side of our relationship, and promising that he would show me why he was the best option for me relationship wise. 

After all was said and done, this person tried using me as a reference - to become a police officer. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a detective, giving the most scathing, up front personal reference that I could. He did not get the job.

&amp;#x200B;

8,"Oh this is my time to shine.   

I'll preface my description of my own behavior by saying I'd left an insanely abusive relationship where I was terrorized in my own home for longer than I should have allowed it to go on.   My ex was (is) a callous drunk, meaner with every round.

My last weekend in our shared home, I'd been in and out of the hospital for weeks with colitis, and was in my bed trying to rest. We'd broken up the week before (after he drank 24 beer and drove home to tell me I was shit) but were still sorting out living arrangements.  He called, clearly wasted, and said he was on his way home ""with a crew"" to watch football on our giant surround system.  I said no.  I needed rest.  I guess he wanted to look cool in front of his buds, because he threatened to kill me if I was there when he got home.  

It wasn't the first time, but I decided it was the last time.  So I left.  And I never went back.  I only packed one bag that day.  [Here I am with the contents](https://imgur.com/a/GVm4AOZ).  There would be no football.  And for about year after, long after we'd divided the property, he'd text asking about a remote.   

""Nope.  Haven't seen em.  Did you check in the couch???""

ETA this kind if blew up so I pulled my pic.  *(It was of me, with an armful of every remote in the house, and a little smirk on my face)*"
9,"After the bro I was dating gave me the silent treatment for a week (while we lived together) and then I found out he was cheating on me, I hid all his protein powder in his dirty laundry. He called the cops about three weeks later, who then showed up at my house asking about stolen protein powder. I informed them that no it wasn‚Äôt stolen and if he had done his laundry in the last three weeks he would have found it. One cop looked annoyed, but the other one burst out laughing. Wish I could have seen my ex‚Äôs face when the cops informed him he needed to do his laundry! "
10,"Found out my ex had cheated on me (and in a really disrespectful way).  His bday was coming up and he knew I had gotten him a really fancy watch; I was planning on having it engraved.  

Gave it to his weed man with the agreement that he could have it for free if he promised to wear it every time my ex came over. 

I *still* get random texts from the ex about seeing that watch. "
11,"My boyfriend is so selfless because I am so NOT a morning person. He wakes up at 4:30am (10 minutes before I wake up) to make me coffee, start my shower, and makes my breakfast/lunch while I‚Äôm in the shower (for my full day at school then work) and then goes back to sleep very nonchalantly before his day starts. I love this man with every fiber of my being."
12,"I have a coworker who decided to have her own baby. Shes never been married, served in the military when she was out of high school (I dont know how many years) but found herself as an RN in her early 30's with no prospect of a husband (or really a want for one I think) but she wanted a baby. She went and got inseminated and now shes got a beautiful daughter. I asked her once why she decided to do it and she said that she didnt want to rely on a man to give her what she wanted and she knew she could handle it. She loves her daughter fiercely and it worked out well."
13,Based on how many people have said vaginal discharge... Can we make a pact to educate our daughters and stop this cycle of shame that we feel because we have a vagina?
14,"He repeatedly cheated on me with multiple women so I had my pregnant roommate piss on a test and then just dropped it at his front door. No note, no way to know who it came from. The panic was real. "
15,"One of my best friends was the product of this. 

His mom ended up having twins though. His story is so damn tragic. Long story short, his mother never married, died of cancer when he was a teen, then his twin brother got killed by a drunk driver when he was 22. 

As far as him being the son of a sperm donor, he didn‚Äôt seem to mind it, nor hate it. His life prior to their deaths sounded real nice. His mom was a super independent badass. 

Edit: his grandfather, who was like a father to him passed away around the other two deaths as well. "
16,"He always spoke about how he hated his dad for cheating &amp; lying to his mom, so when I find out he cheated on me with multiple women I went to his apartment and found a photo of us on his bedside table &amp; wrote ""Just like your daddy"" on it. 
I also took all his toilet paper &amp; hand soap because even though he was the 25 year old man with a job &amp; I was a 19 year old college student he apparently couldn't buy his own shit &amp; I had to buy it for him. So technically it was mine."
17,I put prawns in his curtain pole.
18,Precordial catch syndrome. Random stabbing pain in my chest was super alarming when it first happened and I was really worried about it. I think I spoke to my GP about it briefly but he didn't really seem bothered. Then I saw someone else post about it on Reddit and was so reassured.
19,"My boyfriend tends to carry a lot of tension in his jaw and facial muscles. I'll have him lay his head in my lap and give him a facial massage. When I'm done I scratch his scalp because he likes the way it feels. 

He likes back rubs, neck, and shoulder massage too."
20,His dealer is the ultimate bro to you for keeping up that agreement. 
21,"After getting left a week before our wedding to a man whom refused to admit he was cheating on me. I only found out when was of the girls he was fooling around with broke down and told me:.. 

I subscribed him to the Watchtower (Jehovahs Witness) and requested visits from them and Mormons, etc. Pretty much every religious mailing list as well used his email every time I needed to use an email to see stuff online. His work email as well as personal. Sometimes I just found ‚Äúcool‚Äù things to get mailing lists from. Anything from daily devotionals to Ashley Madison.  

 It was fun until it wasn‚Äôt, and I realized I needed to let go of the anger. But I don‚Äôt regret it. "
22,Should've waited until 15 min into the episode üòÇüòÇüòÇ
23,"I work in histopathology and genetics, which a lot of people assume means dead bodies, but actually you spend most of your time helping people get the right treatment and diagnosis of their cancer. It's great job satisfaction, and since there's a massive shortage of histopathologists there are great opportunities for scientists to step in and advance to a really good salary on a 9-5 job.

There's also ongoing digitisation of pathology cases which means in future there's a good chance you could work from home."
24,"Vaginal discharge stains/bleaches underwear. For the longest time I thought I wasn‚Äôt in control of my bladder, had some kind of infection or whatever. But nope. Just acidic discharge.

25,"I let my ex keep our cat we got together (after he begged me) only to have him call me a month later saying he didn‚Äôt want the cat anymore. When I went to get the cat from our old house, I found that my ex hadn‚Äôt cleaned the cat litter since before I moved out! 
I was mostly mad for the kittens sake. Honestly I doubt my ex took care of him at all. A fight broke out after he refused to clean the litter up so I ended up dumping the whole litter box right on his living room floor. Then I stormed out with the litter box in one arm and the cat in the other. 

Side note - Kitten is 6 now. Found out my ex and his friends were awful to the poor little guy so I‚Äôm glad I took him when I did ‚ò∫Ô∏è "
26,cut the sleeve off of a dress shirt the other woman had bought him and put it back in the closet so only the good arm was showing. Got a text from him a couple weeks later that simply said 'are you fucking serious!?' ... Yes... Yes I am
27,"I‚Äôm always treating myself, I need to chill "
28,"My boyfriend and I skype a lot since he‚Äôs gone so much for work. Well the last week or so I complained I can never really se this face, his room is too dark. Last night we were Skyping and half way through I realized I could very clearly see his (very handsome) face. And I asked if he got a lamp. And he said ‚Äúyeah babe, I got it so you could see me better!‚Äù And it was just really sweet lol"
29,"My mothers decided to do this. 
She had a miscarriage and decided not to do it again, took it as a sign that this wasn‚Äôt the way for them.

They decided to ask a good friend (who had always been single) if he would want to be the donor and that‚Äôs how I have 3 parents. He doesn‚Äôt live with us but he visits twice a month and has done so for the past 21 years. "
30,"I grew up with a narcissistic abusive fuck of a mother. She lived for making me feel like something was always wrong with me. She would revel in pointing out every single ""flaw"" or ""abnormality"" to do with body. 

I remember being around 8 or 9 &amp; getting all these jagged lines all over my arms, thighs, hips &amp; bum. They were angry looking shades of dark purple red. She would freak out at me &amp; tell me that I must be dying &amp; what the hell are those. This is coming from a woman who's given birth 3x by then. I think I was about 11 when I learned that they were simply stretch marks. 

At a similar age I also started to get discharge but had no idea what it was. I thought I was sick. She kept telling me how I was filthy &amp; disgusting &amp; that I better stop doing it or she'd make me wear the underwear I soiled. I took to stuffing toilet paper up there &amp; secretly washing myself with handsoap a million times a day. 

A year or so after that I grew boobs seemingly over night. I went from flat to like a G cup. She laughed at me while telling me everyone would think I'm a whore or a nursing mother. She insisted I didn't need bras of my own &amp; could manage with her old B cups &amp; then would proceed in telling me off for trying to burst out of them. She had a theory that if I forced them into a smaller bra they would stop growing &amp; get smaller. She would do up the straps so tightly I could barely breathe &amp; then berate me for being so fat. 

She was the kind of mother who wouldn't let you lock the bathroom door or have any privacy whatsoever. She would barge in whenever she liked. She would inspect &amp; criticise my body well into my teens. 

We didn't have internet. &amp; my reading materials was always scrutinized before allowed home. I wasn't allowed friends. &amp; the rest of my family were just as fucked up as she was. By the time I eventually got my hands on Biology books in secondary school I could have cried from relief from realising that I wasn't some disgusting freak of nature.

31,Toe hair lol. I saw a commercial recently for a razor where the woman shaves her toe hair and the amount of comments by women saying ‚Äúomg i have toe hair too‚Äù made me so happy and realized its more common than i thought.
32,"My husband of 24 years was cheating on me. I figured it out about 2 months after it really started, but he kept the identity of the other woman a secret. A few weeks before our divorce, I decided I needed to know why it was such a mystery so I did some investigating. Turns out it was a co-worker who was also married.... so I went to their house and knocked on the door and told her husband. My ex had the nerve to call me and accuse me of ruining peoples lives. #teampetty "
33,"This is my favourite. Also, who calls the cops over fucking protein powder?!"
34,I blame those that hover. Sit down or else lift the seat like a man. I don't like having to clean other peoples' pee before I can sit :(
35,I still use my exes phone number for his Walgreens card. He‚Äôs so stingy I know he‚Äôll never redeem any of his points so I randomly get $5/$10 off at Walgreens. 
36,"Laptop, phone, bottle of beer

It would just cycle through a differently emphasized ‚Äúfuck‚Äù"
37,My ex was super into the drift scene and loved cool cars but he was always super broke. He broke up with me on Christmas Day by gifting me a pair of socks and telling me it wasn‚Äôt working out after I had bought him a ton of nice Christmas gifts. The next week I took all my hard earned money I was saving up to by myself a new car and bought the exact one he talked about constantly but was too broke to buy himself. Made sure he saw it by driving through the parking garage he was working at as the ticket guy and it felt fucking good to see his face as he handed me that ticket. 
38,"That violates Geneva Convention, unfortunately."
39,This is the level of petty I aspire to be.
40,"Drinking water or wastewater treatment. You don‚Äôt need a four-year degree, they make really good money, and there are apprenticeships all over. It‚Äôs a rapidly aging workforce so there are lots of opportunities. And it‚Äôs pretty easy work. 

Edit: I‚Äôm getting a ton of questions. I‚Äôll try to split them out below:

*How to get more info or break into this industry:* If you‚Äôre in the US, it depends on your state‚Äôs requirements. A good place to start would be with your local operating engineers union for apprenticeship information and educational requirements, your local community or technical college for process technology classes, and your state‚Äôs environmental or public health department for treatment operator licensing requirements. 

Alternatively, if you don‚Äôt know, find out who supplies the water and collects the wastewater in your area. It‚Äôs likely a city utility company. (You can either google your town name + water utility, or just look at who sends you your water bill.) Get your foot in the door there (which may mean an unskilled labor job at first, but you‚Äôll move up very quickly) and a lot of opportunities open up for you. They‚Äôll provide training, both on and off the job, and you‚Äôll work side by side with the old timers that have been doing it their entire careers while they dump their brain into yours and then promptly retire. 

*Resources*: [American Water Works Association](https://www.awwa.org)

[Find your state environmental department here.](https://www.epa.gov/home/health-and-environmental-agencies-us-states-and-territories) They‚Äôll have the state licensing requirements, educational requirements, and exam information. 

*Salary:* This varies so widely depending on location, unionization, private or public sector, and experience that I hesitate to even give dollar amounts. But I‚Äôll put it this way: in a state where the average brand new college graduate with an engineering degree is going to make $45-55k in private industry, a water operator with 4 years of experience (and the license to go with it) working for a public utility is going to be pulling around $70-80k. Mid-senior level operators clear $100k easily. 

"
41,"Yes! In person and through his best friend. He found out I was in the ER (I have some chronic health issues) but he thought it was because I was pregnant. He showed up and started hounding the doctor for answers and tests. 

I told him no I was not pregnant, and he disappeared from my life after that. But according to his friend, it took a long time to get through his list of other girls in his attempt to find his potential baby mama. Unfortunately most were one night stands off of tinder so he couldn‚Äôt contact most of them.  I moved shortly after, so as far as I know, he still thinks he‚Äôs got a kid out there somewhere. "
42,The period poops. I thought it was just me until one of my friends mentioned it.
43,"I wrote a song, recorded it, and released it on Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, etc

It‚Äôs a great song. Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs a pretty awesome song and was worth the crap I went through.

He‚Äôs a professional musician, I do music as a hobby. Lots of fragile ego at play.

Thank you for listening!

Edit: WOW thank you for the gold!! The biggest compliment. What a wonderful way to kick off thanksgiving. Thank you thank you thank you!

Edit 2: This happened early March. Since then I‚Äôve met a really wonderful person who I‚Äôm optimistic about. Was definitely scary getting into this new thing with all the crap that happened just 8 months ago, but I was very careful to make sure I don‚Äôt punish this new guy for what the old guy did. Happy to report a good outcome in the end of it all!

Edit 3: HOLY CRAP! I just looked at my Spotify page and nearly 2,000 streams? THANK YOU!! I released this song thinking like 12 people would listen to it. Thank you for streaming! I've made a whole $7 off of this song which is 7 more dollars than I expected to. Wow. I have no words. Thank you! "
44,"Seems like no one is actually answering so here:

I‚Äôm not actually sure how it happens, but every once in a while after I stand up, I notice one little dribble on the seat. No idea how it gets there, but when I see it, I wipe it. So there may be instances where I don‚Äôt notice it, therefore I don‚Äôt see it. "
45,"I do my bfs chores when he‚Äôs battling depression. 
I clean his apartment, get his groceries and cook him dinners for a few nights. 

Nothing worse than coming home from a job you hate having to try and do chores when you‚Äôre so depressed. "
46,"He got another girl pregnant, so ofcourse I broke up with him and demanded he return all of my things, including anything I bought him. He asked for some money he had given me back. Instead I got on my computer and printed out ""asshole dollars"". I printed and cut them out and put them in a sealed envelope. He didn't realize until he got in the cab to go back home he had fake money. And no I never gave him back his real money. "
47,"Very well said! People seem to get oddly upset when they find out that women don't just NATURALLY look the way we're represented in the media. 

You want me to look like a model? Then get ready for me to spend at least an hour getting ready every day, about an hour in the gym every day, being particular about what I eat and probably spending more money on food too, and spending thousands of dollars on haircare, skincare, cosmetics, hair removal procedures, etc etc etc. And then don't turn around and call me high-maintenance for doing those things. "
48,"One of my old friend‚Äôs exes unexpectedly dumped her while they were sharing an apartment and a job she had landed him. They spent a few weeks living together broken up, and he wasted no time going on new dates.

My friend decided to rename the petty game. She began by cutting his sneaker laces slightly shorter and recapping them so that they seemed to have shrank. One morning, she hid all of his socks while he was running late for work. He became increasingly frustrated while searching the apartment, so she sent him to check the dryer while she placed ALL of his socks in the middle of the hamper he‚Äôd been checking for the past 20 mins. Needless to say he was dumbfounded when he found them later. Perhaps the most lethal troll was about two weeks after they‚Äôd broken up when she added Chardonnay to his dirty bong prior to him returning from his date. He immediately plopped down on the couch and took a huge rip when he got home and she just watched like an absolute savage as he repeatedly hit the bong, utterly confused as to why it was roasting his lungs. "
49,"I have a masters degree in stats. A lot of more mathematically and science inclined women tend to go for more ""flashy"" stem fields like engineering and computer science. 
 

If you like math at all, I highly recommend at least checking out stats. There are near limitless companies and fields I can work for and in.  I've been working for the same company I interned for when I got my masters. We do mostly consulting for businesses but we also have done some pretty high profile political campaigns and I've made contacts in that world (which I'm not a fan of). 


I'm 25, I've been actually working for about 2 years and I get calls from national head hunters about once a month just based on business and political contacts. I love the company I work for since they are one of the very last ""mom and pop"" data analysis firms in the country and they have been amazingly flexible and generous around my pregnancy and they've also promised to let me stay on, telecommute and work my schedule around my baby so I have tremendous loyalty to them. But it is also nice to know I have lots and lots of options. 


It is pretty much all because I didn't shy away from math when I was younger.

50,"Now, send him a printed photo of a kid about the right age. Keep this going every year, following up randomly with trashily written letters asking for child support..."
51,[deleted]
52,"So I work nights now (going on week 4!) and I don't switch my schedule around on my days off.  We don't have kids so why bother?

So instead of his alarm clock waking him up at 6a I climb into bed around 5:55a and rub his chest and give him kisses.  He LOVES it!  He's told me so many times how me just snuggling up to him makes him feel so loved.  I see him off to work and then I go to bed.  He wakes me up when he gets home around 4p and we spend the evening playing games together.

It works out really well cause I love morning sex, and he loves evening sex (but not morning).  He also loves brinner, so he gets that multiple times a week as well."
53,Hands down - finding out that other women have hair in their buttcrack as well. I thought I was a mutant for the longest time
54,A bro.
55,"Pay off 2 debts. Then I could put those monthly payments toward paying off other debts!

Oh and I'd be lying if I didn't say I'd stop at the beer store on the way home from the bank. I'd buy a $20 bottle of New Belgium aged sour ale."
56,My family is very traditional on top of being very catholic. I spent 7 year with the person I thought I was going to marry. When I realized it wasn't going to happen and more importantly that he didn't want kids we broke up. I spent the next 2 year working my ass of in my field. And after much thought and talking to my parents I decided that children were missing from my life. I have 2 twin boys now and that are the absolute reason for living. If I didn't have the support of my family to help me raise them alone of the financial stability it wouldn't have worked out. 
57,"I logged into his Pokemon Go account and deleted his whole box.

I made a new account just for this."
58,"Wow, the harassment lasted longer than the relationship! Good for you for standing your ground and the way you handled it! What an idiot though for using you as a reference"
59,"I found out a guy I‚Äôd dated for almost a year (and who wanted me to move in with him and wanted to get me pregnant?!) had been cheating with his ex nearly the whole relationship. He was very insecure about his little member‚Äôs size (emphasis on little). So after i confronted him about the cheating and he was begging forgiveness, i texted ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt stress about it. Just means you‚Äôve been disappointing 2 women in bed for the last year instead of just 1.‚Äù Super petty but quite effective as an immediate show-stopper. "
60,"I had been single for a while and decided to join a niche dating site for BBW/admirers. Started chatting with this very attractive, intelligent guy and we were hitting it off at first but he went from zero to stage five clinger *fast* and after a few days of chatting wanted to pay for me to fly to NYC and stay with him for a long weekend. I was honest and told him he was moving too fast for my comfort level, asked if we could slow down a bit. He lost his shit, telling me I was a tease and a flake and ended his rant by telling me I was extremely fat and nobody would ever want me. Like obviously *somebody* wanted me enough to pay for a plane ticket, so... "
61,Thus began your schmear campaign.
62,"4$ bath bomb, hot bath, cold beer, latest podcast episode. 1.5 hours hidden in a tiny room no one could get in. I'm a Poor...its how we roll."
63,"""I'd love to but I can't""

""What did you mean by that?""

""Where's the remote?"""
64,"A couple things:

1. Being attracted to both men and women at the same time is totally a thing! Up until about the age of 16-17 I was in a fair amount of quiet turmoil because I couldn't ""pick one"". I found out about bisexuality online.
2. Being tired all the time, hating yourself for not completing basic tasks, getting distracted during those basic tasks, forgetting huge swathes of information and not being able to muster any enthusiasm for even your favorite things is depression. Before realizing this I thought I was straight up just a bad, useless, miserable person- after finding out I was able to seek help and make actual improvements."
65,"I know some people are reading this OP thinking ""my person does none of this kind of thing."" But not everyone thinks of conventional romance. So don't get discouraged. Sometimes you have to look deeper into your relationship my husband isn't the conventional romantic type and it used to bother me until I realized that's not the way he shows loves. He shows me he loves me by treating me like an intelligent person, working hard for our family, being an amazing dad, he will send a "" how's your day going"" text if he isn't too busy at work, he tells me he loves me, and if I ask him to do something he puts an actual effort into it, he doesn't half-ass things so I don't ask again. Sometimes that's just a person's personality. Still Waters run deep. 

Thanks for the Gold kind Reddit user! "
66,"Orthostatic hypotension! After a while lying in a hot bath, if I got up suddenly, my vision would narrow and I would get really dizzy and it felt like I would almost pass out. What's really happening is that blood vessels dilate from lying down, the warm bath, etc. When I stood up quickly, my baroreceptors didn't compensate quickly enough to accommodate for the change in height and blood pooled in the extremities, depriving the brain of oxygen for a split second"
67,"I'm the product of this! My mother has always been very open about her experience. 

My mother was a divorced single mom of an 8 year old boy. She was in a stable place and really wanted another kid. My family was extremely supportive of her decision. She was tired of dating around, didn't want to just find a guy and go, so to speak. 

The process was not instant. It took 9 months of treatment before she got pregnant. She had a healthy pregnancy and I was born in 89.

I do not know anything about my bio dad. I mostly dont care, except that I ended up with health problems that weren't typical of my mother's side of the family. I plan to have genetic testing done for any high risk issues before I have kids.

I didn't live without a dad for long, my mother met the man I consider my dad when I was 2!"
68,Straight towards my student loans.
69,"I took the last rolls of toilet paper in the apartment on my last day moving out. He HAD to have the most expensive kind and since I paid for them, like a lot of our stuff, I took them. They were technically mine haha. I was done at that point with his laissez faire attitude towards money and how unappreciative he was in general, so it was like a final fuck you.
I could have been way pettier, believe me."

""actually that is just vaginal discharge and you're missing my clit"" "
72,"A long time ago my ex cheated on me with a friend. So I went on Craigslist and put an ad up for cheap tickets to 98 degrees, who were coming to town. I put my ex's phone number on it and asked for people to call from 10pm on, because I ""worked 3rd shit"" 

I've grown up a but since then, but I still think it's funny."
73,"First time I got a migraine I thought I was dying or had some kind of horrific neurological disease.  I get auras, lose part of my visual field, have tingling, nausea etc.   Was a teen so I didn't know anything yet.

 Went to the neurologist - I was like so happy when he said it was migraines.  He was like, ""I've never seen anyone so happy to be diagnosed with migraines.""

I think about that every time I have a migraine and all the horrible things I thought it was, and it makes them a little easier to bear."
74,no one is going to own up to it. But seems pretty obvious why. They are lazy and don't give a fuck about other people. There's no good reason to not wipe the seat if you're one to hover.
75,"Putting a name on panic attacks. There's nothing like being a child/entering puberty and aside from the regular teenage craziness to literally feel like you're going nuts.

EDIT: Holy shit, this blew up, now my highest rated comment is about my messed up brain. Okay then.

Edit 2: To everyone saying they didn't realize they had them - what actually helped me understand it better before learning what it was were the Potter dementors. I know they're supposed to symbolize depression but at one point when I ran out of ways to describe what happened I just told people it felt 'like that'. (Which ended up with the books being taken away from me for 'reading oo much into it', hah)."
76,"Most of my friends and I work in cellular molecular biology, either academic or industry. A friend of mine just got a histopath job, and we‚Äôre all gobsmacked. ‚ÄúYou work 9-5? No unpaid overtime?? No weekends??? You make HOW much???? YOU HAVE A PENSION????‚Äù "
77,"Amen! Also, teach boys. I love that my guy friends and my husband have a good idea about all of these things as adults, and aren‚Äôt grossed out by female biology like my father was. Boys and girls should know how male and female bodies work so they don‚Äôt shame each other and can support one another. "
78,"That I can feel the ovulation ( or being close to ovulate). I went off the pill after about a decade, I honestly forgot what it‚Äôs like... It took quite long for my first period to come. One day, I felt pain simiƒ∫ar to period pain, but no bleeding. I was quite certain, it‚Äôs a cyst. But no, my cycle kicked in and I have been having ‚Äúmittelschmerz‚Äù in the time of ovulation ever since."
79,"I love hearing stories about unconventional families and how they work. They are probably more ""normal"" day to day than most people think. "
80,"Oh my jesus, I‚Äôve never told anyone but when I first adopted my cat I briefly lactated and when I called my doctor in absolute hysteria he said it was normal and probably just because of the loving nurturing feelings I was having towards my cat.

I ascended to a new, freaky realm of cat ladydom that day"
81,I signed my ex up for a bunch of crazy fetish porn using his work email. It‚Äôs been almost a decade and I still get a good chuckle about it. 
82,"After a messy breakup, my ex kept harassing me at home and at school by shouting awful things at me. I asked him to stop but he refused because it was ‚Äútoo fun.‚Äù So, in the spirit of ‚Äúfun,‚Äù I posted a shirtless picture of him (which he posted on social media right after our breakup as another way to psychologically torment me) and his phone number on Craigslist‚Äôs men-seeking-men page. The headline? ‚ÄúYoung guy looking for fun.‚Äù

Not only did he have to change his phone number, but he also never bothered me again."
83,I returned the fancy expensive never worn dress shirt he left at my place and exchanged it for a fancy dress for myself.   
84,"I didn‚Äôt like the dress I had picked out to wear to my nieces wedding. I walked into a boutique and basically requested to be fully styled for the event. Dress, shoes, clutch and jewelry! It was super fun being ‚Äúdressed‚Äù by the sales  team. I looked and felt phenomenal at the wedding. It was totally worth it. "
85,I am a maritime deck officer 26/f and navigate a 600ft + ship in Japan. I work 4 months on and then have 4 months off (I mean completely off no obligations to my company). The company flys me to and from the ship and I travel the world and make fantastic money.

87,"My niece was born when I was 15 and lived in the house with my family for a while. During this time, I started lactating. I was convinced it was some sort of cancer or I was pregnant and didn't tell anyone out of fear.

Years and years later, I'm a birth and post natal doula and very well versed in breasts and lactating. Little did I know when I was younger, women can lactate without having had any children at all! Some women are more sensitive than others. I, for instance, started lactating just by being around a baby with all those love hormones flying around. It got more intense when she cried!


EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! Really glad this has gotten so many people talking and I'm grateful for those sharing their experience.
Remember to see a doctor about any abnormal changes to your body to rule out anything serious! "
88,Follow up question: what do you think happens when you leave your period marks on the toilet seat? 
89,The fact that this even occurred to you...you are a genius.
90,Put it in savings.
91,"I walked into a stall recently and was disgusted at what I assumed was pee on the seat. After wiping it with 6 inch wad of paper and finishing my business, I flushed. Only to turn around and see the force of the clean water rushing in sprayed all over the toilet. So now the person after me thinks I peed on the seat. "
92,"This is excellent revenge. No damage to property, just making life incredibly annoying."
93,When I first got my period I thought I was bleeding to death. I cried in my room for hours waiting for my mom to get home thinking I could die any minute from too much blood loss. When you google ‚Äúbleeding out of vagina causes‚Äù period is not the first thing that comes up. It was only a temporary relief after I found out it was going to happen every month. 
94,"My problem was not doing what I had interest in. Even at university, it's taken me 3 years to figure out that all the talk about job prospects aside, I'll never do well unless I do what I love. I just finished this semester at the top of my class for every subject I took. Do what you enjoy, and you'll find yourself automatically wanting to put in more work and effort. What you learn will stick better too."
95,"Exploding Head Syndrome, I would have these dreams, often shortly after falling asleep where I would ‚Äúhear‚Äù  or dream theses loud noises. It would startle me awake and left me confused if the noise actually happened or if I dreamt it. For me the noise was incredibly real but I knew it didn‚Äôt happen. I thought I had a brain tumor or something was wrong with my mind until I did some googling and figured out what it was. It still shocks me when it happens but at least I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm about to die. "
96,The number of posts I‚Äôve seen on r/relationships where the dude thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him cuz of a tiny bit of white stuff in her underwear... woooooh! We definitely need to educate everyone about how normal that is. 
97,"Memes sent randomly during the day when I'm traveling 
Also I try to pick up some small bit of local candy when I travel. I think he's as excited for the candy as he is to see me lol"
98,"Instructional Design. Not many people know there‚Äôs actual degrees and careers for that. It‚Äôs very rewarding and really fun too. If you get good at it, you could move up in a company and make six figures. If not, low end pay for someone with at least a years experience is at least $55k (more in certain areas). "
99,Nothing to add but this is an amazing thread and I hope young people read it and expand their horizons on what jobs are out there. SO many interesting careers that no one knows about that pay well and are fascinating! One regret I have as an adult is that I had no idea what was really available to me as possible job options. I think it would have changed my life.
100,"We share a bath together every week, have our nightly FaceTime and we send memes to each other when we know the other person is busy. It‚Äôs so nice coming out of a stressful meeting to see lots of messages from him. 

We‚Äôve been long distance for 8 months, moving in together on Wednesday and I‚Äôm so excited üòÑ"
101,"About a year ago, I found a painful pea-sized lump in my breast. It had been hurting on and off for a few months, and noticed it only hurt when I was on my period or ovulating. So I went to the doctor and brought it up, terrified it might be breast cancer. 

My doctor gently informed me it was not a tumor, but a cyst... in my boob. It was right then I learned you can get hormonal cysts in your breasts like you can on your uterus. I was so freakin relieved, and a little embarrassed I didn‚Äôt know this before. "
102,"Had a lesbian friend do this when she decided she was ready, and she also ended up finding her life partner while she was pregnant!  It's such an adorable story IMO.  As far as I'm aware, all are happy with how things turned out. "
103,"This is hilarious! Not the abuse, obviously, but the revenge. It really puts things into perspective when you know taking a bag of remotes is going to ruin him."
104,Going to a trade school. You can get a really good paying job out of it without as much debt. It's worked out really well for my and I graduated with no money owed.
105,"I broke up with him after being treated badly for too long. He kept sending me vicious emails when I wouldn't answer his calls. I responded describing a fake new boyfriend who goes down on me at least 20 mins at a time, in Comic Sans font. 

He was a graphic designer and would rant about how bad that font is on occasion. He knew it was intentional. "
106,"after blocking my ex-boyfriends number, I would give his number to every guy who asked for my number downtown. 
I went barhopping every weekend during that point in my life so it happened semi frequently. I‚Äôm sure it made his blood boil to have dudes texting his phone looking for me "
107,"All that treating yourself must get exhausting, you should treat yourself üëåüèº"
108,Funny how your ex doesn‚Äôt realize he &amp; the other woman are the ones ruing lives.
109,"I mean, most of us don‚Äôt, and certainly not all the time. If and when we do, it‚Äôs because performing femininity is an extremely time-consuming and often very expensive process. If men had as many steps they had to go through in order to be considered to ‚Äúlook their best,‚Äù it would take them hours sometimes too. "
110,I went to a Panera bread after hours and acquired 3 trash bags of bagels and threw them at his house.
111,"I know a woman who was born to a single mother and from a sperm donor.

She has 30 siblings all around the same age, some of them look similar to her but most of them look different.  You wouldn't be able to tell.  They're all in their 30s and are on a Facebook group for people who were born of that man's sperm.  They have some easy way to find each other of they want, I guess the hospital / father provides them with information on their siblings born to other mothers.  "
112,"as a former repo agent you‚Äôd be amazed at how many cars we took back because of this exact type of revenge. made my job a whole lot easier because really anyone that would go to the lengths to hide their car to the point where i got called in (my job was skiptracing people who straight disappeared), was usually not above doing other shady shit. "
113,"I once went on a date with a guy who I wasn‚Äôt sure about, we had really clicked texting but in person I wasn‚Äôt really sure. Four or five days after our first date he asked me for a second and I said sure, because I wanted to put my misgivings to rest. At the end of the date, I explained to him that he seems like a really sweet guy but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out. He seemingly took it quite well, although he seemed disappointed.

The next morning I get a call from a mobile number I don‚Äôt know and I pick it up and it‚Äôs this guy‚Äôs mother (he was thirty one!) telling me I‚Äôve broken her son‚Äôs heart and how dare I lead him on. I tell her that I don‚Äôt think two weeks of talking and two dates constitutes that and tell her I need to get to work.

At work I go on my lunch break and go to get something from my desk when my desk phone rings ‚Äî it‚Äôs reception and the dude has turned up with flowers. I ask the receptionist to tell him I‚Äôm not available, she says sure and hangs up. About ten minutes later she calls back, and you can hear him in the background screaming at her to let him see me. He eventually gets escorted out by security.

Ten months later I‚Äôm on my first weekend away with my now (and then too, although it was very new) boyfriend and I get a text from the dude‚Äôs wife. That‚Äôs right, he‚Äôd met and married someone else in ten months. She tells me to ‚Äústay the fuck away from him‚Äù. I wanted to text back, ‚ÄúGladly.‚Äù"
114,He is so attentive it blew my mind. The little details he remembered from our conversations. I‚Äôm a workaholic and he knows how to help me recognize when I‚Äôm burn out. He takes care of me mentally and emotionally. 
115,"I spent our year together wearing flats because he was self conscious that he was slightly shorter than me. When we broke up, I bought the tallest, sexiest heels I could find and wore them to a mutual friend's party. The look on his face when I arrived towering over him was priceless. "
116,Oh another....when I moved out i took everything except i purposely left a box of magnum condoms half empty in one of the bathroom cabinets. He never could fit into such large protective gear. 
117,This one was big for me. Both my sister and mother would make fun of me for it. Fuck them both for that. 
118,"He stalked me for about 2 weeks. He attacked one of my guy friends because he thought we were dating, he commented on all my social media, he went psycho when I confronted him and my brother had to scare him off. 

Edit: this happened in school when I was 16, I'm at work so I rushed to type this and forgot to mention it was a teenage boy that pulled that lol. Would have been a lot creepier if it were an adult! "
119,"Penis pictures under mothers pillow:   
After finding out my then boyfriend of 2 years had cheated on me with multiple girls I was devastated. Without a blink I printed off 53 copies of his penis (from pictures he had sent me) and hid then around his house hiding them in boxes of Christmas decorations, under his mother‚Äôs pillow, inside of his fathers pill bottle. Just about anywhere I knew his youngest sister couldn‚Äôt get into. I was 16 and full of rage. Considering that his mother and father enabled the behavior of their son and called me for months after to forgive him because ‚Äúit‚Äôs in the past‚Äù , I don‚Äôt regret a thing. "
120,"Holy. Shit. I have had this my entire life and always thought I was destined for an early, heart related death despite regular EKG findings. Thank you!"
121,"My ex had a mediocre wine collection that she was very proud of. Since both of our names were on the rental agreement, we were stuck there for a few months together. 
Right before I packed up - she was out of town for a trip - I took every bottle out of the wine fridge and placed each one in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes until they were nice and toasty. Then back in the fridge they went. 
Enjoy that Cabernet Sauvignon Vinegar ‚Äò05. "
122,"Oh my god. So I used to have this roommate that would leave blood on the inside rim of the toilet seat. I‚Äôm assuming when she pulled out her tampon, it hit the edge of the seat, smearing blood everywhere. And THEN she would wrap it in toilet paper and leave it on the counter and forget about it!!! The trash can was under the sink which was apparently too far for her to reach while on the toilet seat. She was nasty AF. "
123,"The general shape of my genital region. Schools discuss all the mechanics of sexual reproduction in health class, including showing pictures of STDS. When it comes to the normal exterior/general appearance of genitals, they ignore it altogether. When I saw a documentary about women surgically altering their hoo hoos,  I realized mine was actually normal."

126,"This is my sisters story. 

Her shithead ex gifted her a pair of brand new white Nike Air trainers. After the breakup, he demanded them back. He had done enough to warrant an application for a Domestic Violence Order, so all four of us (me plus 3 sisters) went in on a team effort for this one. We dyed one side of each shoe, one red and one blue. Then we put them in the box, dye side down so you couldn't see it when you opened the box, and gave them back to him that way. As my sister didn't want to see him, I delivered the shoes to his mothers place. The abusive text messages all four of us got after he pulled them out of the box were read in mocking voices over glasses of wine. "
127,"i still had access to his fams netflix so i would change the names to ‚Äúcheater ‚Äú ‚Äú lying pos‚Äù ‚Äú i am garbage and treat women badly ‚Äú

Same ex, I took a picture with ""our"" cat that she insisted was hers and made it my only visible public picture on Facebook. I caught her shit talking me on Reddit for that picture. 

In hindsight, I should have done more. She was the worst.

Edit because I can't respond to people directly: [Cat tax!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoUWdAqF5xA/) And I definitely kept the cat. I was the only one feeding him, paying vet bills, and hanging out with him. His name is Tyson. :)"
130,"A friend of mine had the spare key to her ex's truck as well, so we would randomly ride by his house and hit the panic button to set the alarm off. We would laugh our asses off every single time."
131,Did you get to witness the panic?
132,"Hahaha I sew! I've always joked that my favourite tool is my seam ripper. Thing's just so damn handy :)

Near the end when it was really bad and I was planning my escape I'd put a couple of stitches into the armpits or cuffs of his shirts every couple days or so and then let them all out when he finally started to get really puzzled about why his arms weren't fitting. 

I needed a laugh tonight. I'd totally forgotten about this until reading some of these stories. He's dead now but I really, really wish I could message him and have a laugh about it"
133,"I mean, it's a stereotype. It's only true for some people some of the time. The problem is in expecting people to be/behave like the stereotype you assign to them.

It *can* take me hours to get ready if I'm doing my makeup and hair really fancy. On a regular day, it's more like 20-40 mins (depending on whether I shower that day or not)"
134,He was more easy-going. I didn't have a magical moment or anything; we just worked out. Every day I wake up and continue to consciously choose him.

137,"I was making out with some random guy at a party, untill he started to get pushy to ""go to his car with him"". 
Yeah, I was not in the mood for sex and his pushyness was creppy. 

I said I was going to find my sister and got away from him. 

A while later he grabs me by the arm and says that I'm a tease, that I should know who he is, he has influence and would ruin my life, he would find me and get me banned from all the cool clubs (????lol). 

And afterwards he'd keep hovering around and staring intensly at me. Really freaked me out. 

He also showed up asking if we wanted a ride when me and my sister were waiting for an uber to leave. "
138,exactly! Our family functions just like any other family. Only downside is getting stuck in the eternal loop of ‚Äògo ask your mum‚Äô.
139,"When my ex husband left me for another woman in the Philippines, he did not stay to bother moving his stuff and expected me to do it. I put everything up for sale in a garage sale and left for another state myself knowing all the stuff he rented in his name like the tv, washer and dryer and other expensive items were still in the house. Three years later I get an angry message from him demanding to know why I didn‚Äôt bother calling the rental place because now he‚Äôs got a pending felony for the couple thousand dollars worth of unreturned property.

Teenage immaturity but I don't regret it."
145,"I was friends with a guy about ten years older than me. In my early twenties, that's all I wanted it to be. We were in different phases of our lives and at the time, I wasn't looking for a relationship anyway (I had just gotten out of a LTR). He pursued me constantly. I never once entertained his advances. After repeatedly making it clear that I was not interested, and him repeatedly flirting regardless, I told him I wanted to end our friendship as well. He was starting to make me uncomfortable and I told him as much. He flipped out, called me a slut (for *not* sleeping with him? Or anyone?) and began pursuing my *pregnant* best friend as like... revenge I guess? She also was not interested (hello? She's about to have a baby!), then he went after our third friend who is a *lesbian*! We all agreed to cut contact with him, block his number, and block him on all social media because he had successfully alienated all of us with his creepy advances. Everything was fine for a while until I started getting follows and friend requests from strangers. I don't normally accept those but one guy on Facebook said he saw that he noticed my University and degree program and was interested in talking more about it. He seemed friendly enough so I accepted the friend request. After a few weeks, I was talking with my friends again and we realized they got follows and friend requests from the same guy. It was him! He made upwards of 7 fake social media accounts to follow us, flirt with us, and pursue us further. I am the outspoken one in the friend group so I took the lead on laying into him. I threatened a police report and possibly a restraining order. He finally got the picture and has backed off. It's been two years since any of us has heard from him. 

Obviously all our social media with our identities are private now and we thoroughly vet our friend requests anymore.

For example, if I generalized an entire sex in a negative way based on how a few people at work interacted with me, and I openly disparaged another employee as ‚Äújust a cleaning lady‚Äù because everybody likes her better, I‚Äôd take a step back and consider what all those people said. Then I‚Äôd probably realize that I‚Äôm being stuck up, narcissistic, and entitled, and that‚Äôs why guys would rather be with the cleaning lady. Sure, I might make more money and have more power than the cleaning lady, but she‚Äôs clearly got something I don‚Äôt. She‚Äôs also probably not throwing a tantrum because internet strangers aren‚Äôt telling her what she wants to hear."
158,Not masturbating the way the ladies in the pornos do it. 
159,"A few of my friends have done this. My colleague always had serious relationships in her 30s but none of them worked out. She hit 40 and realized she couldn‚Äôt wait anymore for it to develop organically. Esthetically, she‚Äôs always liked the look of South American men, so she booked a trip to South America and went to a sperm bank. 

She‚Äôs was very open about it, she said the sperm bank had profiles and pictures of all the donors, she found one she liked (I think she said her donor was 23 years old) then she came home, found out it worked and she was pregnant and 9 months later, bouncing (healthy) baby boy came. 

I think the particular donor that she picked selected the option that he would allow contact, so when her son turns 18, if he wants to find out more about his bio dad, there‚Äôs an open channel for that. 

Another friend was a successful artist but never had stable relationships. When she hit 38, she decided it was now or never so went to a local sperm bank, got pregnant, and had a daughter. 3 years later. She went back to the sperm bank and got pregnant again from the same donor because she wanted both her children to be full siblings. 

I think for both of them, because they ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to be single mothers, I feel like sometimes they are unfairly judged, like they‚Äôre not allowed to admit they‚Äôre having a hard time or they‚Äôre not allowed to admit they‚Äôre learning as they go. For my colleague, luckily she makes a good salary and we live in a country where childcare is affordable so she has a full time live in nanny, and everyone at work adores her son so we take turns babysitting when she needs a break or if she has to travel for work. My artist friend is very well off so she‚Äôs able to support both her kids and afford childcare as well. Neither of them have had relationships after having babies but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a concern, neither of them have this sense of ‚Äúomg my child doesn‚Äôt have a father figure‚Äù. 

They both have no real regrets about their experiences. My colleague‚Äôs only comment she really has is she wishes she did it sooner because being a single mom in her 40s to a toddler (and working full time) is quite tiring. "
160,"I write letters to my SO every now and then, but I only give them to him when he's feeling down about something. It always makes him feel really loved and appreciated, and helps him get in a better mood."
161,"Think about good aspects of yourself. Skin, hair, wittiness, how articulate you are, being a nice person, that you are good at math, whatever it is. You‚Äôre obviously humble that‚Äôs a start. I went wig shopping with someone yesterday who unbeknownst to me, cannot grow long hair. She loves my hair. My hair is natural, but i didn‚Äôt see it as great until she kept pointing it out. 

It‚Äôs hard to be concious of our gifts sometimes if you don‚Äôt have people around you observing from the outside and saying ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs not something everyone has.‚Äù  When it‚Äôs the inside looking out try and think of your good points that you‚Äôve noticed occasionally even if you start with one or two. "
162,"Ages ago I had a bf that was far wealthier than I and had a MA compared to my BA and never let me forget it.  I was young, with almost zero self esteem.  It was a mostly miserable relationship in which he bragged continually and cheated.  It was an adversarial relationship and I began to find my spine, and I broke up with him.  A couple of years or so later I was eating lunch with my new bf. This one was delightful.  Handsome, too.  I noticed that the ex-bf, david, was seated at a nearby booth with a bunch of buddies from his work.  He saw me, then I heard him say to them that I was his ex, that he had broken my heart, and he was going to make my day.  He did this sort of schmoozing walk to me, all smiles.  Before he said a word, I stopped him.  I told him that he had been a sorry excuse for a boyfriend, that he was the sloppiest kisser and the quickest comer in bed, a real loser as a lover.  that he was a selfish, conceited git and that he could just turn around and go finish his lunch.  I spoke clearly and loudly enough that his friends could hear every word.  A couple of them clapped for me.

Petty, I know, and from this distant point in time I can see I really had some anger issues.  But, still, it felt great. "
163,"This is crazy, I had no idea you could lactate for someone else's baby. It's really cute actually. Feels very like community spirit-y "

165,"$220 worth of lingerie. Got properly fitted by a professional to match my shape and body type, been wearing the wrong size my entire life. I now own bras that support, hug, and cover me, with no spilling out or popping out anywhere, and the quality is so luxurious and soft that it feels amazing and comfortable. I will never, EVER buy a Victoria's Secret bra ever again. "
166,"I lived in an arts dorm in college and my ex was a musician. We wrote a song together using a miniature upright piano and a guitar. We lived on the same floor and one day I heard him singing it with some other girl so then I opened the door took the piano from under her hands and I still have it to this day. 

I literally can‚Äôt believe I did it, but I thought it was pretty shitty of him to share a love song we wrote together with someone else. And now that piano has a pretty great story attached. "
167,"Ah, I saw another thread where the husband was sure that the wife cheated cause he smelled her underwear after seeing white disacharge and it smelled like ammonia which he though was from somenone elses sperm. Nope, disacharge sometimes smells like ammonia. Also, I think one of the reasons why men never know these things is cause women make sure to be freshly showered and have clean underwear if they are about to have sex cause we are tought that it would be disgusting otherwise, allthough it is pretty natural and most of the time has nothing to do with hygiene."
168,Exactly. üôÑ I‚Äôm not proud of this moment but it‚Äôs the only thing I did that was petty. I have a son who is watching. I need him to have a good role model. Not a crazy one.

170,"My boyfriend and I both leave for work at about the same time. He calls me at 7:30 every morning to talk before we go in. We normally stop talking at 7:40 because I go in at 7:45, but I love the routine. 

We have one bar we both go to that we're adopted as 'ours'. He won food for year there, so we go there weekly. They know us now and it's so comforting and relaxing.

We both can watch Paddington Bear 1 or 2 and enjoy it fully.

He's just my best friend. It's easy with him. We both are in social work, come from similar families, and have the same values. We get along easily.

Plus he genuinely appreciates LUSH. 

"
171,"He respects me as an equal. It sounds like a low bar, but it‚Äôs hard to find."

173,"Perfusionist at least in Canada. You do need additional training after completing either a BSc or RN degree but the current job market is fair, you work in a hospital and the pay is pretty good (average yearly salary is roughly 90k)

174,"I met a personal trainer while looking for a bikini coach. 
He asked me to dinner to discuss goals. Weird flex but ok. Turned out to be a date, apparently. I was ok-ish with it at the time. 

We went back to his place, and two things were a nope: 1) his house was basically sterile. White couch, no paintings, no decorations. 2) BEAUTIFUL mastiff big‚Äôol‚Äôdoggo... that he kicked. 

I couldn‚Äôt drive because of wine, so I slept on his couch. I woke up to him staring at me. I made excuses and noped the fuck out. 

I texted later with a respectful, well written (in conjunction with a close male friend) response declining both training and seeing him again. 

He found me on all social media and added me, Unfriended, added, unfriended so I would see the notifications. This was on IG and FB. I got ESSAYS of texts that flip flopped just as bad, ‚Äúplease I know I love you already and if you give me a chance...‚Äù to ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never find anyone better than me, you‚Äôre making a huge mistake‚Äù 
he called nonstop for a solid week. I came to my phone with 36 missed calls at one point. 
When I blocked him, he created new accounts and added me. I just kept blocking...

He left me a VERY long threatening voicemail. I considered getting police involved, but I live in a very secured house and decided blocking him every new number was sufficient unless he came to my house. (He didn‚Äôt)

About a year later I saw him randomly at a tattoo shop and he followed me to my car, asking to talk. I immediately called my friend and told him to call the police if he heard anything weird on the phone because Bruno was following me. 
He ended up yelling at me as I pulled out. 

Nothing has happened since and that was about a year ago. "
175,"O M G. Lived for almost 30 yrs before finding out that period diarrhoea is a real phenomenon. My God, none of the women I knew had it. I used to feel like such a freak. It took a random article on the internet for me to know this. i cannot express the sheer relief that I was not alone.


EDIT: all my lovelies, united we stand, in our diarrhoea despair. Here's something to make you all smile - my highest rated reddit comment is about period and poo. An apt metaphor for life. Hahaha..."
176,"Absolutely agree. I train young adults to get into this field. In Canada at least you only need grade 12 to get into it (although it's easier to move up if you have relevant college or university). Good pay and really rewarding job! 

Edit: you also don't need to be excellent at math or science. You learn by on the job training and specific training courses. I teach lots of people who struggled with math and science in high school and still excel at the job once they have some training."
177,That little squiggly worm/line thing you see when you stare at the sky or water for too long. I thought I would go blind from it but realized it was normal when they made fun of it on Family Guy
178,"Lol this is why I don‚Äôt use tinder anymore, this shit would happen to me constantly. I think part of it is because I‚Äôm a chubby girl with huge boobs, so 9/10 opening comments would be something crude about my tits.

187,"Because he kept his word.  He told me he would help me out, and I did not take him seriously.  I thought it was just talk. And the next morning he showed up, tool box in hand to fix what needed fixing.  I watched him walk towards me, sun in his hair a smile on his face, and I knew.  My heart felt like it suddenly expanded through my whole chest and a peace came over me.  he asked me to move in with him 2 weeks later.  And I did.  It was a very nice marriage.  


How was he different?  He was absolutely 100% for me.  No questioning, no ""let's see if this works out"", no ""we need time""   Everything clicked.  Our politics, ideas about religion, ethics, children, work.  We got each other right away.  By the end of our second day together we both said we would be together from then on.  Nooky was delightful, too.  

Before him I had boyfriends who said that they loved me, and they did, but never before did I have one say that, and then follow it up with meaningful action.  "

* Bring HIM flowers on dates (I‚Äôm a lady, he loves sunflowers)

* Send him silly jokes during the day/tell him hilarious work stories to get his mind off stressful work things

Things he does:

* Shows up on his lunch break just to give me a hug when I‚Äôm having a bad day

* I sometimes have to work REALLY late, so he‚Äôll sometimes show up at the store with coffee or a snack and sometimes bring his dog and hang out for the last hour or two so I‚Äôm not bored/lonely

* He has been known to come home from Target with things like a bottle of nail polish or a blouse/dress that he saw and thought I would like because it‚Äôs my favorite color or it‚Äôs a similar cut to another piece that I love or something like that and he wanted me to have it

The last one surprised the hell out of me because it ended up being an insanely well-fitting shirt in a color I never would have chosen that ended up looking awesome on me.

229,"The night we were supposed to meet, it stormed terribly. I, to this day, don‚Äôt know why I was this stupid, but I opened Tinder and messaged him and said, ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt really want to go out in this weather. Do you just want to come hang at my place?‚Äù He fired back, ‚ÄúI was really hoping you would say that.‚Äù So I sent him my address.

His pictures had showed him to look my age, average build, maybe a little on the skinny side, with big brown eyes and upswept eyebrows. In one of the photos he was scuba diving, in one he was hiking, etc. He wasn‚Äôt really what I would call handsome but he was cute enough. You know, in my league, I felt. When he showed up, he looked about ten years older and about 200 lbs heavier. Against my better judgement and the fact that I was completely turned off, partly by him and partly by the lies, I invited him in anyways. I‚Äôm not a perfect person. I try not to put too much stock in looks, because I know that I have some major flaws. I am not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, and everyone is not mine. That being said, I like to get to know people a bit before I start passing judgement. There hadn‚Äôt been anything in our conversations so far to indicate that we wouldn‚Äôt get along, so I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Offered him a drink, ushered him into my living room, and threw a vinyl record on. 

He told me within the first five minutes that I had great blowjob lips. I immediately felt demeaned. 

He told me he was an engineer so I tried to steer the direction of our talk to things he would be more interested in. I was familiar with 3D printing and a few other concepts from work, but he let me know very quickly that he was *way* beyond my level of understanding and wasn‚Äôt interested in holding a conversation with me about it. 

He tells me I have a great rack. I laugh a little nervously and try to be polite and make sure there is distance between us on the couch. He asks if he can touch my breasts and I say no. He goes into a tirade about how he hasn‚Äôt gotten laid in ages, he‚Äôs rusty, dating is so hard. I stay silent.

He asks if he can kiss me. I say no. I say I have a meeting early in the morning for work. I really have to go to bed and get some sleep. I need him to go. 

He kisses me anyways and I push him off and wipe my mouth in disgust. I look back at this moment, here, and I only had a split second but I can‚Äôt help but think, *What if I had jumped up and chewed him out? What if I had reached for my phone and threatened to call the cops then, if he didn‚Äôt leave? Why didn‚Äôt I use my split second, instead of wiping my mouth, to prevent what happened next?*  

I'll gloss over this part because it would require a major TW. Suffice to say he assaulted me, and my reaction was to freeze. 

So, the last time I turned down a guy who gave off the ""doesn't handle rejection well"" vibe, he sexually assaulted me. After that, when I got a vibe from certain people, I would just ghost. Admittedly not the best way to handle it, but I was hurt and afraid for a long time. Luckily now I am in a LTR and am out of the dating pool for hopefully forever! 

In my experience it didn't matter how polite I was or how I went about it. People like that, you can't control how they're going to react. "

231,"After almost a four year relationship(and ""engagement"" with no ring) ol' shitface was cheating on me with a girl he met for work that lived 1,285 miles away..I found out through texts on his phone and tried confronting him about it..he was drunk and hit me. It was a bad night. I flipped out and said leave(of course)..he stayed out drinking the next couple days and I couldn't/didn't see or talk to him. I go back to work like normal...
Then I come home from working all day, the day before Thanksgiving to find he's gone. (Talk about devastating) He packed all his things, and some of mine and left. But he did leave his bed(I assumed he didn't have a big enough truck to take it) and I never actually saw him again.
Anyway, Black Friday I decide I need a new bed. I go shopping and get one(for a great deal)..they deliver it that night. So as the delivery truck pulls out, I text him ""your bed is ready to be picked up"" with a picture of it leaning against the nasty dumpster in my apartments...in the rain. 

Ohhh he was mad, and it was glorious!
I was thankful for something that year after all. "

There's so many directions you can take a stats degree, because literally every industry had data they want to understand

\- want to get into Machine Learning, Big Data, or AI? pretty much all fancy words for statistics + comp sci

\- want to understand the human genome, cancer or other health issues? bio statistics

240,"Just recently while talking to my best friend, I discovered that it's normal to not enjoy masturbation! From shows like Big Mouth, browsing sex positive subreddits, and just general conversation about how many women know exactly how to get off by masturbation and usually is easier then vaginal penetration, I thought I was weird for not enjoying masturbation. It feels okay for a minute or so, but it just gets boring and just feels like I'm touching my body, no different then rubbing my arm. But it came up in conversation and it turns out both my best friend and her close friend are the same way- masturbation just doesnt do anything for them. "
241,"He respected my boundaries without hesitation, manipulation or complaint. He gave freely without expecting anything in return. He accepted both the good and bad parts of me completely. He made me believe I was strong enough to be a better person."

I smelled the problem after sprinkling a generous dusting of spice on the dough.  I tried wiping and even vacuuming from a height of 0.5cm but I still left a lot on.  I poured a shitload of cinnamon on it, upped the brown sugar, rolled out my rolls and slammed the motherfucker in the oven.

So I get matched with this guy on OkCupid (it‚Äôs been a few years since this happened and Tinder wasn‚Äôt a thing yet üòÖ) we‚Äôll call him Duncan. I was 22 (F) and he was a little younger, he was 19. At first I wasn‚Äôt going to meet up with him, I figured if we were dating he wouldn‚Äôt be able to go to bars and such with me but he said he was interested in friendship first and if romance developed later then that was ok. So I said ok and we met up for coffee. 

As we‚Äôre talking I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm not attracted to this guy at all. I‚Äôm not a shallow person that cares much about what someone does for a job or how much money they make but he was not motivated for the future at all. He worked part time at Office Depot, wasn‚Äôt going to school, had no plans for the future, was living with this parents (which at 19 isn‚Äôt a big deal) but didn‚Äôt even have a car. His mom had dropped him off for our ‚Äúdate‚Äù.  So we‚Äôre talking and he‚Äôs asking about my plans for the future. I was a shift supervisor at Panera at the time, going to school and working on joining the Navy. He started saying I shouldn‚Äôt join the Navy because he wanted to see where our relationship went and it wasn‚Äôt fair to him for me to leave him. I was like ‚Äúuhhhhh...‚Äù that was the first red flag. 

He asks if I want to go see a movie. I had already stupidly told him I didn‚Äôt have any other plans for the night and wasn‚Äôt great at be upfront in rejecting someone so I agreed because I figured I wouldn‚Äôt have to talk to him. I drive us to the theater and he keeps trying to hold my hand. I lied and said I was uncomfortable driving with only one hand on the wheel. We get to the theater and he insists he‚Äôs going to pay for my ticket. I insist that I want to pay myself. I just felt like he was trying to pay so that I would ‚Äúowe‚Äù him. He tried arguing with me at the counter and I vehemently resisted so he dropped it. We go in to the theater and throughout the movie he keeps trying to put his arm around me, hold my hand, get me to lay on his shoulder and at one point tried to pin my face so he could kiss me. I was so uncomfortable and just kept praying the movie would end. 

Once the movie is over I don‚Äôt want this guy to get back in my car. There‚Äôs a Mexican taco shop right next to the theater and so I suggest we get some food. He agrees and I say ‚Äútext your mom the address and she can pick you up there.‚Äù as a way to blatantly tell him he‚Äôs not getting back in my car. While we‚Äôre eating he‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs never met anyone like me before, he wants to see where this is going to go, he just ‚Äúknows‚Äù there‚Äôs something special about me and our ‚Äúconnection‚Äù. I keep trying to find ways to tell him that it‚Äôs not going to happen. Finally we‚Äôre finished with our meal. His mom hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. I said ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm going to head home. I‚Äôve got work early tomorrow but it was nice to meet you.‚Äù And hold out my hand. He said ‚Äúoh I hadn‚Äôt messaged my mom yet. Could you drive me back to the coffee shop? She already knows where that is.‚Äù I know this guy is a predator, I know I should stand my ground my I wasn‚Äôt good at being assertive. So I give it against my better judgement. We arrive at the coffee shop and I insist I really need to head home. He stalls by saying his mom isn‚Äôt there yet, telling me how special and beautiful he thinks I am. He begs me to not join the Navy. He says he‚Äôs absolutely sure God brought us together. I‚Äôm just agreeing with anything because I want him out of my car without getting aggressive. He keeps trying to pull my face towards his so that he can kiss me. I try telling him I‚Äôm not comfortable kissing on the first date but he‚Äôs still being pushy. 

Thankfully I‚Äôm saved by my dad calling and I tell Duncan I really have to go or my dad will be calling his police buddies to come find me (my dad isn‚Äôt a cop üòÇ) he FINALLY gets out of my car and I drive away as quick as possible. In the 15 min it takes me to get home he‚Äôs already sent me a few text messages reiterating how in love with me he is. 

Over the next few weeks he keeps trying to get me to hang out with him and I keep conveniently having plans that prevent it. During this timeframe I meet the man that eventually becomes my husband. I tell Duncan I‚Äôve met someone and he said ‚Äúoh cool, me too. I‚Äôm fine being friends.‚Äù I‚Äôm hoping this means he‚Äôll stop messaging me. But no, instead he wants to talk about his girlfriend, how amazing their sex life is, how she‚Äôs in to BDSM and wants to go in to the details. Finally after some really disgusting and explicit messages he‚Äôs sent me I‚Äôm done being nice. I tell him that we can‚Äôt be friends anymore because my boyfriend was jealous (he wasn‚Äôt but he didn‚Äôt mind me saying he was if it meant this guy would leave me alone) Duncan gets furious and starts sending me all these messages like ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt just come in to your life and tell you not to be friends with me, we have a connection. Where does he want to meet? I‚Äôll fight him for your love. I‚Äôm never going to stop loving you.‚Äù Blah blah blah. I just never responded again. He would text me every few weeks, then every few months asking if I was single again so we could meet up. I was always so paranoid he might find out which Panera I worked at but then remembered he wouldn‚Äôt be able to drive himself to come stalk me anyways üòÇ "
246,Use half of it for move in costs to my own place so I can move out of my place I still have to share with my ex. Use the other half to decorate it and finally get a mattress I like and can sleep on.
247,"I did it. People‚Äôs reactions have been almost unanimously positive. It‚Äôs a lot of work solo parenting, but also somehow less stressful being the only decision maker. 

My main concern is what my son‚Äôs reaction will be when he‚Äôs old enough to understand. I worry that he might feel like he‚Äôs missing out by not having a dad, although he has strong, consistent males in his life. I worry it was a selfish decision and he will regret that I did it. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm so glad that I had him; I can‚Äôt imagine my family without him in it. "
248,"I didn't wait for the breakup to get petty. I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me through his friend a couple days before my birthday. I told him not to mention anything to my boyfriend and I would take care of it. For my birthday, he took me shopping for a new outfit, got my hair and nails done, then took me to an expensive dinner and movie. 
At the end of the night, I asked that he take me home even though I normally spent my weekends at his house. When we got there, I got out the car, walked around to his side, had him roll down the window and said ""I know you've been cheating on me with the ugly coworker of yours."" I went inside, locked the door and changed my phone number. Seventeen year old me was a fucking savage. "

My fianc√© had swung by my car after he‚Äôd gotten off an hour earlier to scrape my windows, then had coffee waiting for me at home.

265,Yes! It randomly came up in a cautious conversation when I was 17 and I was so happy I wasn‚Äôt the only one. Granted I had only seen other women naked in porn and it doesn‚Äôt help that they‚Äôre completely hairless most of the time.

277,Discharge is vagina's way of cleaning itself. So it's normal to happen more or less every day. I'm not sure how some girls go commando. Going without underwear under a skirt? No way! I wouldn't want to leave a snail trail or a wet spot.
278,"I went back to school at 30 to earn a bachelor's degree in nursing after having gotten pretty much straight Bs and Cs in high school and my first time in college. There were a loooot of assignments including reading, powerpoints, study guides, online tests, etc. I figured out about a semester or two in that there just wasn't enough time in the day to get through everything and instead of feeling guilty for skipping some assigned reading I needed to find which way of getting the information was going to give me, personally,  the most bang for my buck. For me, reading is helpful but a visual demonstration really nails it home. So I would read through most of my assignments but didn't get discouraged when something didn't quite make sense, instead of getting caught on it in the reading I would look it up on YouTube or try and find a diagram online. 

Maybe because I'm a visual learner, I also found using memory palaces and mnemonics to be helpful.  This was usually for info that I couldn't quite understand 100% and required straight memorization, like pharmaceutical names and mechanisms of action.

I think really aiming to do your best is a helpful mindset to be in too. In school the first time I did ok when I didn't try all that hard, like I said mostly Bs with some Cs and As. But I was curious how well I could do when I really applied myself,  studied for every test and wrote the shit out of every paper.  I ended up getting a 3.8, being in the nursing honour society,  and being asked to be a TA for my pharmacy class. I'm a firm believer that anyone can learn anything, you just have to find the best way that your brain makes sense of new info and work hard enough to really learn it. "
279,He probably didn't have a better reference than OP. It tells of a lifetime of idiocy.
280,I‚Äôve had a painful lump in my armpit since I was a teenager (over a decade) that also became painful around ovulation/my period. I‚Äôd had numerous doctors look at it and wave me off with no real explanation. I was also terrified it was breast cancer. Then right after my son was born it got HUGE and painful and I learned it‚Äôs auxiliary breast tissue. I also had no idea that was a thing. 
281,"Cosmetic procedures aside, women in porn are usually waxed and plucked eyebrows down, and almost always get their lady bits bleached and have makeup airbrushed on everywhere.

288,"I do get frustrated when the time frame isn't associated with an event - work and NYE are VERY different things to get ready for. 

I, admittedly (and proudly) take a long time to get ready. However, a lot of women have more things to do that are ""basic"" that take time. 


Washing long thick hair takes a lot longer than buzz cut hair. Shaving legs, arms and who-ha takes way longer than a face. (Don't forget the plucking of eyebrows.)

Also, what counts as getting ready? If I'm already shaved, showered, plucked and my hair is dry/straight? I can be bar ready in 45 minutes with a full face of makeup.

So, the stereotype doesn't bother me in and of itself because I personally believe it's generally true, BUT I wish there were separations concerning events. I take the exact amount of time getting for work as my husband. Also, I don't really care how other people spend their time, lol. If you want to spend 90 minutes in front of the mirror? Cool. In front of the TV? Also cool."

293,"Worked in the same building as this guy. We were both smokers and I needed a lighter one day so that's how we met. We went on one date, made out a little that was it. Well after that friday night in this man's head I was his girlfriend. We had this one date on a friday night and by sunday night he had texted me asking me to FaceTime 15 times. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go to work the following week he sees me outside, he comes to talk to me basically tries to kiss me in front of our work building I move back. He asks me when we can hang out again I tell him ""I had a really great time, but I just got out of a relationship and I need to spend some time just on my own."" He says okay. One week later, he again asks me when we're going to hang out, I'm of course confused because I thought we already talked about this and his response was ""Well I gave you your space so I figured we could hang out again."" Well this turned into my avoiding him and not going outside at certain times of the day because of this he then was blowing me up on social media asking to see me, which I would ignore. Finally, I made up a lie and told him I started seeing someone else because I just wanted him to leave me alone. I still see him sometimes outside my office but ever since I told him I'm seeing someone he's backed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only positive thing to come from that situation was I quit smoking to avoid him. "

For his 40th birthday, I gave him an expensive spa aromatherapy and acupuncture package.  
We broke up the day after he turned 40, when he pulled some last straw jealousy bs.

Two weeks later, I cashed in on the package and had a nice spa day to myself. "

I went to CVS and pulled out the subscription inserts for just about every single magazine, and put his address and selected ""send my first issues, bill me later""... Also I was at my college's health clinic, tons of flyers where you could request ""more information"" be sent to your home about everything from birth control to tampon samples. Still cracks me up."

300,"Mildly related. I once had a yeast infection with 13. I wanted to tell my mom, but I didn‚Äôt want her to think I already had sex.  I thought this must be an STD and she‚Äôll never believe that I‚Äôm still a virgin (which I was) and I was sure she wouldn‚Äôt believe me that I got it somewhere else (like the toilet seat) 

I ended up telling her because I I thought I need medication (it was sooo itchy!!) and she informed me that it‚Äôs most likely due to the antibiotics I was taking at that time.  (Never heard about yeast infection or what they are like before that) 
I wish I would have known before, so much mental stress and worrying and extra days of itching. 


She is in general very open minded and we had and still have a very close and open relationship. I knew whenever I would have sex I can talk openly about it, but at 13 sex and ‚Äûthings down there‚Äú were such an awkward topic for me"
301,"Yep. Can confirm, I have toe hair! "
302,"There was a post either here or on r/beauty or similar along the lines of 'how do some women look so polished all the time?' and the best response was basically 'here are all the things you have to do to fit into this aesthetic that we call put together/polished' and the list goes on and on. That shit takes time.

I'm also reminded of the Guardian article today about the Victoria's Secret fashion show and how the models have to spend 9 months intensively exercising for hours a day, eating an extremely strict diet, dehydrate themselves for 9 days and then spend hours in hair and make up to walk there and back in 30 seconds. It takes time and effort and money to look good, although in this case I think it is a case of somewhat diminishing returns. Then again I don't get paid to walk around in lingerie. Maybe I'm in the wrong job?"
303,"Literally just happened two days ago.

My ex moved away to college and she gave me this ukulele to remember her by. She never played this ukulele. Ever. But she had to pack all of her stuff up so she let me hold onto this ukulele for storage/memento reasons. 

Anyway, we‚Äôre off and on the last year or so. I flew out to her place over the summer to try and patch things up. We did. I accidentally left one of my favorite shirts there. We ended up breaking up again before I could get it back. 

So she texts me randomly this week saying she wants it back. Cool, fine by me. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll ship it out this week. Can I get my shirt back?‚Äù ‚ÄúAw sorry dude, I actually don‚Äôt have it anymore.‚Äù 

Sold the ukulele for $5 two hours after she told me that."
304,"Exactly this. I take about 10 minutes to get ready on a normal day because I don‚Äôt wear makeup and don‚Äôt care about my clothes. On special occasions, where I‚Äôm expected to ‚Äúlook my best‚Äù, that turns into 45-60 minutes because doing hair and makeup takes forever. "

307,"I had been seeing a man under the notion that he and his wife were split up, living in seperate houses, and beginning the process of divorce. After a couple of months, he told me that this wasn't the case and that they'd decided to move back in together and work things out.

At the same time, he also told me that he still wanted to keep seeing me and that he didn't love her (couldn't stand her to be precise) and just felt stuck with her. I told him to go to hell, then sent her screenshots of our entire conversation and noped out of their lives for good. Last I heard of them, she moved back in with her family out of state and he's a raging alcoholic.

322,"There is a thing called ""Negative Comparisons"" talked about by John Gottman. An example would be, ""it would be so much better if x."" It's one of his major pre-cursors to infidelity or unhappy relationships. When all you're thinking about is how things could be better or different, you don't learn how to accept and love what you are currently experiencing. I used to think this way pretty heavily when I was in a relationship, and now all I think is ""it would be better if I was still with her."" "

There are days where I literally put my blood, sweat and tears into it and not one person would ever know that and I get a lot of satisfaction out of that. It's an art that I can't put my stamp on or get recognition for and i like that no one could see it and say ""hey I really like that stair case you put into such and such park."" It's just a part of the park and will hopefully be there for at least 100 years if I built right. Some peopke dont even realize its a jpb.

It feels like a very male dominated field, but I‚Äôve met tons of high up women in tons of different companies. My whole team at work, tech industry no less, is 4 women 2 men. 

Good salary, lots of opportunities to move up/move into different specializations of supply chain, seems super boring but turns out to be pretty interesting. "

329," my mom and stepdad found joy in  making fun of me for many things like my protruding nipples when I first started puberty, my 'horse teeth' or my huge  'flippers' (feet) etc. so when I started getting discharge I was mortified. I hid my underwear, threw them in the wash when no one was looking, lined my undies with toilet paper and sometimes washed down there multiple times a day. Thought something was wrong with me but when I was 12 there was barely an internet to do research on.

 When i was 15, i started periodically getting cycsts in the creases of my legs (where my underwear elastic sits) it was incredibly painful at times and I didn't know why it was happening. In my child development class my teacher was showing pictures of STDs and I was mortified and felt like I would faint...I was a virgin, hadnt even kissed anyone but thought somehow I'd gotten an STD. My older cousin brought up once that she gets painful cysts down there too (I'm shy, shes extroverted and talks about anything) and I didn't say anything about it but was relieved to hear it.

I also thought the hymen was like a trampoline like tight skin up inside you where your cervix is and when you had sex, the penis had to burst through it and rip it open which also horrified me in middle school. Thank goodness for ""scarlet teen"" when the internet got a bit better"

Like referred pain, when you actually have an itch in one place, but you feel it somewhere else, so you scratch that spot, only another spot starts itching, so you scratch it, rinse and repeat about five times until you actually hit the spot that itches. I've mentioned that to people before, and they look at me like I'm crazy, but I swear it's real. "
334,"Lord, thank you. I always kind of wondered how you're supposed to distinguish between normal vs abnormal discharge. Cervical fluid sounds so much better to my ear, and it's more descriptive. 

My favorite discovery recently is that the Clue app has a function to track the characteristics of your fluid (egg white, sticky, creamy, or atypical). It's totally helped me recognize the monthly patterns to mine. It helps a lot to know that the changes are actually pretty predictable, and more importantly, totally normal! I can't remember anyone ever really telling me that all those different types would happen and that they would all be fine."
335,"Yes. Multiple times. It was his way of showing dominance I suppose.

337,"I live in London. I don‚Äôt get hit on at work because I work in a school and everyone is very respectful and mindful of each other. I‚Äôve been hit on in the local Tesco and in the corner paper shop. Last night in a bar, I got hit on whilst waiting for my boyfriend to leave the toilet. The frequency really depends on what I‚Äôm doing, but once a month isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary. I mostly go out with my boyfriend so it doesn‚Äôt happen then. Other times if I‚Äôm on my own I wear headphones and a massive scowl which deters most people. "
338,"Hobbies. 

Figuring who you are inside makes you care less about your outside. 

The more you fall in love with who you are and what you are capable of the less bad stuff you see in yourself. 

Learning who you are and what you want grows you in ways you didn‚Äôt realise. Everything falls to the side lines   "
339,"When I was 9 i was in a summer camp and there was a 9 year old boy from my group, who liked me and we hanged out together. He gave me some candy and a plastic bracelet from the camp store. After a couple of days he decided to kiss me, but i didn‚Äôt want to kiss him. So he told me to return him all the candy and the plastic jewelry, that he gave to me."
340,"I had a psycho ex who was really into gardening. He was a pathological liar (lied about his job, his family, his age, who he voted for, etc) and he loved to grow pumpkins for halloween. Well... after I found out about all his lies, I ended shit and he agreed I could come get my stuff from his place while he was at work. This particular year, he only had one pumpkin that ended up doing well. So I ripped it out of the ground, smashed it to pieces, and put it under his covers like the godfather. Right on his side of the bed. Dirt and all."
341,"Omg yes! So my underwear sometimes shows some kind of discoloration in the vagina-area. I used to think I probably just, idk, peed my pants a lil bit, but turns out that this is really common and women's vaginas have an acidity, evidently powerfull enough to mildly bleach fabric. Kinda cool if you think about it, but also glad to know I am not peeing myself without realising it. "
342,"I'm 24, just learned that this is a normal thing THIS YEAR. My mother would always just gaslight me, call me disgusting etc. She still feels like she has to ""remind"" me to wash my lady parts every day. I shower every day woman, stop!"
343,"This is not biological but the whole nice guys thing.  I grew up before the internet and would get those kind of reactions from guys and I thought it was me - that I did something to attract these weirdos or that I did something to make them like that.  

When I realized that this happens to most women, I felt much better.

Well-not that I am happy that this happens to other women, but that it was not me in particular that engendered it."
344,"Idk but I know for a lot of houses where I live (midwest USA), especially older ones, it takes a long time for the water to heat up once you turn it on and to ""hot"". So unless you want to be standing in freezing cold water for a couple minutes (no thanks!!!) you need to let it heat up a bit THEN hop in.     

My current house is new but it still takes about a minute. I just brush my hair and get undressed while it heats up."
345,"You'd take hours to get ready too, if you were culturally expected to fuss over your appearance to achieve an ethereal look that doesn't exist in nature, if your appearance was considered to be your ""everything."" It's not fair to complain that women spend too much time fussing over how they look and at the same time demand that they do.  "
346,"Your mother is a terrible, terrible human and I hope you are No Contact. Hugging you from over the Internet cuz NO ONE deserves that kind of abuse as a child. "
347,"OH! That just happened to me yesterday!

It was a friend's roommate, who we will call Bob. Bob and his girlfriend Cathy were looking for threesome partners; they happened to find my profile on Fetlife and added me. We talked for a while. I'd previously found Bob attractive, but was not interested in Cathy, and there were aspects of Bob's personality that I found off-putting.

Basically, Bob was what Reddit would call an ""edgelord"". He enjoyed using the n-word, the r-word, anti-gay slurs... and although he wasn't bad-looking, hanging out with him kind of felt like I was hanging out with Cartman from South Park, except less funny.

After about two days of back-and-forth between the two of us, I realized I couldn't sleep with Bob and respect myself, so I turned him down. 

And he got *pissed*.

All I did was tell him basically ""I don't think it would work out because of how you throw around racist and anti-gay slurs; it makes me really uncomfortable"" and his response was:

""yeah i don't either, self absorbed snowflakes that need to make themselves feel superior by tearing everyone else around them down isn't someone i want in my life or around me anyway. enjoy having your existence from your high horse pressing your nose up at everyone for having different views and opinions.""

Ooh, damn! So we blocked each other. I spoke with Cathy as well... because not only were they looking for threesome buddies, but they were also looking for new friends in general. They were very isolated from the world (owing in part to Bob's personality). Trying to be helpful, I told her that if they were looking to make friends it might help if Bob softened his harsh personality a bit.

So she said ""I don't feel it is necessary for him to change who he is. If someone doesn't like him as he is then it's their loss. He is an amazing person with a huge heart, who has gone through hell this last year. Instead of judging him, you could have tried to gain his trust and get to know him as a person instead. You hurt someone who didn't deserve it.  All over a word. I think it isn't him who is too aggressive, it's you who is too sensitive""

I explained to her that rejection is part of dating and sex, and if she wanted to sleep with a racist that was her choice, but I have the choice to reject people I'm not interested in. She said ""go back to your safe space"" and that was about the end of it.

Pretty fun."

I was wearing 32 B, they told me I'm a 30 DD (I have small boobs I was like lady you're crazy, a D is the size of my thigh let alone a double D. Then I tried on the ones she brought me. French people know their stuff, and their sizing is diff and the way their lingerie is made is also different). Look for the brands Chantelle, Natori, and Simone Perele ! You'll never go back. A black pair and a nude pair is all you need, and they have sexy styles that feel amazing. Their lace is SO soft, it's ridiculous. Best purchase ever (mine was $220 because I bought matching panties. But the bras range from $70-120, depending on what styles you get). "

363,"I personally make roughly like 86,000$ USD working half the year and belong to a big union (keep in mind this is pretty entry level I have only recently graduated (2 years out) the growth is exponentially and I am upgrading my license next month and will make a lot more). I went to one of the seven maritime academies in the United States, graduated with my 3rd Mate Unlimited Tonnage License (ability to navigate any size ship in the world) and bachelors of science degree in Maritime Transportation. 

I did not grow up in this industry like so many of my class mates. I was in high school dating a drummer and all my friends were getting heavy into drugs and alcohol, I saw the maritime industry as my way out, to travel the world and be as far away as possible. I am extremely thankful because I had many friends commit suicide or die from heroin overdoses. 

However, I did not want to go to my maritime school. It was military esq and I grew up in a giant hippy family where my cousins were ether professional artists or skateboarders. I had never been yelled at before in my life, I love fashion and indie music and the transition at my school was very tough at first but I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I really feel so thankful every single day that I am able to do what I do. I truly feel that I have the BEST job in the entire world. 

I wake up, my commute is literally 15 seconds from my stateroom to the bridge (where we navigate from), I make coffee, I take over the ‚Äúwatch‚Äù from the Mate who is navigating and we switch out, I am up there with my two lookouts who I am in charge of (usually men and usually at least 20 years older), we listen to music/podcasts and just go about the set track line approved by the captain. I will radio other vessels if we have to make passing arrangements and just maintain the vessel‚Äôs safety at all times by keeping a sharp lookout. We watch the sunrise together the captain will come up and we will all bullshit before breakfast.  I‚Äôll work overtime for four hours and in total I work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. We do not have days off while onboard.

Second would prolly be a recording of my road rage when I'm driving alone. My husband doesn't believe I curse like a sailor when I'm tucked safely in my Prius when no one can hear me. 

Third would be my dad telling me that he loved me, because I miss his voice. "
366,"I realized the reason nobody liked me was not because the world was against me, it was because I was legitimately awful. I started to focus on what in my life I'm thankful for and learned to appreciate the people around me for who they are and appreciating the things that make them unique. I started being nicer to other people, I stopped complaining all the time. I then learned to apply that way of thinking to myself and realized that I'm kind of neat. I keep up my self confidence and sense of purpose by always having a goal and doing things that make me happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't say it was an easy change, even though it looks like it. It was a huge change in my way of thinking and it took a lot of effort (and still does), but when I realized that I actually liked myself for the first time in my life, it was life-changing."

My first boyfriend had shared nude photos of me with his friends, which I found out about (they got put on a photo sharing site, it was a whole thing and a long time ago so not as huge a deal as it would be if this happened now but still traumatizing). Anyway, I still had the spare key to his car and I considered doing lots of different things to him, but a friend suggested we put fish or something in the fabric of the seats of his car. I wasn‚Äôt interested in completely ruining his car so we ended up packaging some frozen baby shrimp like a present and her mother created a ‚Äúvoodoo doll‚Äù out of yarn to put in the gift box.
