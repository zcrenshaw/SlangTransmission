0,"""There's never a good time to have a baby! Just do it!""

WOOF. There are definitely some very wrong times though (drowning in debt, not in the best relationship, currently suffering physical/mental health) and it's the only choice you can't take back. "
1,"""If you really love someone, you stick by them no matter what.""  


No. Or at least, no to the way that has been manipulated. 'No Matter What' was supposed to mean no matter what happens in the world. NOT no matter what he does that hurts you.  If he is doing things that he KNOWS are wrong, you do NOT have to put up with it. Keep loving him, but do it in your own heart, away from his toxicity.  Or hers. whomever."
2,(Laughing nervously) What the fuck?
3,"""He's mean to you because he likes you"" which isn't necessarily advice but it definitely teaches women to accept shit they shouldn't from men. "
4,"We had some unspoken rules: 1 no bragging, 2 no PDA, 3 it was expected that if we develop any feelings we have to be honest and walk away.


Well, it didn't take long before rule number 3 went out the window. It's been ten years and we're married now. I guess we didn't do FWB very well!"
5,I tell people I'm infertile. Now we're all unhappy with this dumbass conversation
6,"I had perfect vision, until after I gave birth. Now I can't do anything without glasses. Turns out your eyes expand and contract with pregnancy."
7,"&gt;In your experience, when did ""all the good ones"" start really going? 


Interestingly, ""the good ones"" didn't even show up until my mid-late twenties.


"
8,"Multiple times. They did not respect either my personal boundaries or common social boundaries. 

When you realize that someone you found attractive can't be trusted to respect personal or social boundaries, you realize that they could easily become dangerous to you. That makes them creepy."
9,"Seche Vite topcoat. I was like ""yeah okay another cheap quick dry nail polish that doesn't completely dry down for a few hours"" NO FAM, you can bang your nails around in 30 minutes or less with that shit. It's truly magic. "
10,"Weight lifting advice, mostly.

""Don't lift too heavy!"" 

""You'll get bulky!""

""You'll damage your baby-making organs""

""No man will ever want you if you're muscular""

"
11,It's less about ticking boxes and more about not ticking the wrong boxes
12,"Was in court and sitting in the back was this attractive dude - clean cut, good built, and handsome. For whatever reason, I assumed he was either going to be a complainant or a witness. Then his case gets called with him as the defendant. The complainant comes up and she describes her interaction with him - one afternoon, she was walking her dog when the defendant came up to her and asked if he could pet the dog. Shortly following that, he asks for her number (she said no), then he asks to use her phone (she, again, says no), then she tried to slowly walk away when he starts following her. Creeped out, she starts running towards her apartment and he started to run after her until she went into her apartment. While in her apartment, he tried to slam open the door, attempted to climb in through the window, and was screaming crude things at her demanding sex until the cops came running over from a block away. 

People be crazy. "
13,"Got to college to find a husband. I went to college to get a BS, not a MRS."
14,"Family: Don't get piercings or a tattoo, that's permanent and follows you for the rest of your life! 

Also Family: when tf up having a baby???"
15,"""Just give him a chance"". "
16,She broke my tailbone on the way out. No one ever warned me that might happen. 
17,"One Christmas I ate an entire ring of cocktail shrimp myself and barfed all Christmas Eve. 

I still can’t look at, touch, or smell cocktail shrimp or seafood sauce. "
18,You're not... you're not supposed to swallow it
19,"It's pretty good, I'd say. I've started saying (to my husband), ""Here comes your cute wife!"" when I enter a room he's in. It makes me giddy because he always agrees and proceeds to gas me up. 

This is coming from someone who doesn't fit any beauty standard, being an overweight Korean American. "
20,"For me, a FWB situation is just casual dating, but with the knowledge that it is not exclusive and isn’t going to become serious. We kiss and hold hands if we want to, we go out on “dates” (I’ve had some FWBs I’d only do drinks with, and others would do dinner too). 

There’s also no expectation of emotional support. We can talk about things while we’re together, of course, but I’m not going to be the person you can count on to call after a bad day just to vent. "
21,"Micellar water, I remember first seeing an ad for it and thinking there's no way that will take all the makeup and dirt off my face but lo and behold it is amazing.

Also Laneige lip sleeping mask. I have pretty much had chapped lips constantly since I was a kid and this stuff is so great I don't even have to use it every day to get the benefits. The first time I used it my lips peeled so bad I thought it was making them worse but I was actually shedding like a snake which revealed soft lips underneath."
22,"He was ""emotionally unavailable"" - which I summed up as, his view towards me was, ""If you are not happy or horny, then FUCK OFF!

""Any sadness, worries, insecurity - deal with that shit on your own. That's what I do!""

&amp;#x200B;

He told me I was ""too sensitive &amp; too needy"" when I pressed him to connect &amp; be supportive of me, and open up so I could be supportive back. For a sickeningly long time, he had me convinced he was right and I WAS too needy. &amp; if he empathized, I'd just 'wallow' in misery &amp; it would be worse.

&amp;#x200B;

To overcome it, he went to therapy &amp; learned the truth - it's impossible to selectively repress emotions &amp; opening up &amp; sharing with loved ones, especially your wife, is healthy."
23,"My Co worker gets this a lot as she's in her 40s. Our director was saying that kids were great and she quipped up 'How's the divorce? How's your son doing at uni in America!? It's been what, 6 years since you saw him last? Are you back in speaking terms?' it was a bit savage but absolutely beautiful "
24,"I lost the ability to know when I needed to pee. I didn't realise until it dawned on me I'd gone about 12 hours without peeing. That was about 4 or 5 days after the birth. The urge didn't come back for several months. I must have some seriously strong pelvic floor muscles.

Oh, and LAXATIVES PEOPLE! No-one told me how utterly essential they are after giving birth."
25,"My kitten's name is Jolene. I've been training her to come when I sing ""Jolene"" by Dolly Parton, but I've changed some of the words: Jolene, Jolene, JOlene, JOLEEEENE/I'm begging of you please don't take my can/Jolene, Jolene, JOLENE, JOOO-LEEENE/Please don't take the tuna from my can. And then I give her snacks to encourage her to keep coming when I sing the song"
26,"Learn how to cook, so a man will marry you and you’ll be a good wife. Like fuck you, I learned how to cook cause I like to eat!"
27,"i would love to just throw everything out and start again 
i secretly hate it when people give me stuff i feel bad to throw out"
28,"I’m 23 so whenever I look after my nephews my family members are like “ahhhh you’ll have one of your own soon!”

Fuck off will I! I’m in the last year of my degree, don’t have a career yet, my boyfriend is in the first year of his, I don’t have a house, and I don’t have savings (just had to buy a car so they are depleted). How on earth would I buy a house AND all the baby stuff and THEN cover the daily expenses?"
29,"When I kissed him at our 2nd or 3rd date, He got super aggressive doing it. Not in a passionnate way at all.

He hold me waaay too fucking tight, was super harsh, put his full tongue in right away. I couldnt move my body or my arms. It was just horrible. I felt like a prey.

Let me tell you, I never saw that guy again. 

&amp;#x200B;"
30,All the damn time. Like 60% of the online dates I've been on. Friends of friends. Everywhere in the world there are guys who are cute until they start talking and are super creepy.
31,That it’s selfish to focus on and put yourself first in your life 
32,I honestly think part of the issue is older generations begin really out-of-touch with the economic realities of today. 
33,Can we carry on a conversation fairly easily?  Do I enjoy spending time with them?  Are they looking for basically the same thing I am?  Do I feel like I trust them enough to want to spend more time with them?
34,"I kept texting throughout the day pretty minimal. Literally only contacted him for sex or a casual hangout that would probably lead to sex lol. We'd snapchat sometimes too, but I refused to let myself get to close or learn tooo much about him because I fall for people pretty easily. "
35,"Well, they don't.

I got married at 23 to a guy who was just great. One of the good ones. We went on to have 20 solid years, some great and some difficult. Had a kid. Built a life. Made plans.

And then 2 years ago he left me. Mid-life crisis all the way.

I was devastated, broken, so sad, and extremely heartbroken.

But this past summer I started dating. It was scary. I'm in my mid-40s. I haven't dated since my early 20s. I've read online I have no chance because my 'sexual market value' is low in part because there are so many available beautiful smart young women.

But what I found was basically a grown up version of the dating scene of my 20s.  Some guys are players. Some guys are trouble. Some guys just aren't compatible. Some are very good. But nearly all of them are wary and scarred.

So you have to change your definition of what a red flag is. And your 'want' list will and should be completely different.

But they're out there. So if marriage\partnership is what you're looking for, it can be found. I just personally think marriage, as an institution, is for young people so they can pop resources and start\raise a family. I'd like a companion, sure, for life and sex. But marriage? Why would I give my all to that again?"
36,"For the first time I corrected a teacher in front of his class two days ago.

I work IT in a school. I was fixing something on his computer while he was doing is lessons as usual.

&amp;#x200B;

I hear some stupid things teachers says to their students. Wrong informations, some too mean comments for my taste. I never ever said anything in front of the class. Always waited for the kids to be out to talk with the teacher when it bothered me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not in the business of undermining teachers in front of the students. They had it bad enough. And for most, it's stupid mistakes, and being just a bit distracted.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, I didn't even think twice. When the girl complained that that boy was annoying her on purpose, by poking and mocking her, and the teach answered ""that's because he likes you"", I immediatly said ""That's doesn't mean it's right, nor that you should be okay with it. Like or not like, no one as a right to treat anyone like that"".

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair to him, the teacher agreed immediatly with me, and insisted that I was right and she shouldn't accept it. Also give the boy a detention.

40,"I discovered he had two dogs cowering silently in the cupboard under his stairs. They were terrified of him. I walked home 3 miles in the middle of the night, feeling bad for leaving them with him. I called the RSPCA first thing in the morning, and they got to his house before he'd even got out of bed. Hah! "
41,"I wrote about this in another thread but I think it should be restated: 

Putting your keys in between your fingers to have some type of weapon to defend yourself with. While it might seem practical, in reality if you ever actually try to defend yourself this way you’re more likely to end up ripping up your own fingers instead of effectively attacking someone else. If it’s legal where you are, pepper spray is a much better option. "
42,I didn't expect my vaginal opening to be so jacked up or my boobs to be so deflated. I had 32A and went back to 32A... but they lost their perkiness. I really had no idea how badly my self esteem would plummet.

45,"I've heard several women say that ""the most important thing is to be nice."" To which I reply with a resounding, ""Fuck that."" Being ""nice"" didn't get me through law school, and it didn't get the guy who was basically stalking me away from me. Anyone who says this is usually saying ""Don't rock the boat or offend my fragile sensibilities."" "
46,Husband was doing drugs for over a year behind my back. It got really bad and he almost lost his job and I was left taking care of our toddler by myself. I couldn't trust that he would be able to watch him alone. He ended up going to rehab and has worked very hard to be clean for over a year now. I have forgiven him but made it very clear that I and our kids will never go through that again and we will be gone if he ever does anything again. I still worry about him relapsing and what will happen. I also will catch myself reliving it in my head and hating him for putting us through that. Even though we have moved on from it I wont ever forget it and a part of me will always resent him for what he did and the fact that he missed out on the first year and a half of our sons life cause of it. 
47,"On our very first date, my husband was 1.5 hours late. Usually I would’ve long left but something in me was like, “you need to keep waiting”. He had sent a message saying he was going to be late but then radio silence after that. 

Turns out his car had broke down in the middle of a Saskatchewan winter, 2km from home. He jogged home, got in the shower and rushed to meet me with his other vehicle. Other vehicle had a flat. 

Okay, he’s gotta repair the flat. Lug nuts are rusted on and he can’t snap them. Calls a buddy from down the street to bring his impact gun to get the rusted lug nuts off and changed the tire. 

Now he’s disgustingly dirty again so he has to have another shower and change. Then he finally hops in the truck and comes to meet me. I was not impressed (but kinda impressed). 

Turns out, he’s a gem and we’ve been married 7 years. "

53,Artichokes.  I was eating one and mid way throug I realized a gigantic worm had burrowed into it and died.  FUCK I hate even thinking about it.  I spat out what was in my mouth and basically made eye contact with a dead worm.  It was like the size of my pinky.  Now I want to cry. 
54,"It's great! Approximately zero percent of my self-worth is tied into my genetic appearance. My middle eastern family members are always talking about how to be lighter/skinnier/more white ""passing"" but I find that to be a concern more for the older generations who risked social isolation/oppression because of their appearance.

I was warned about my hair falling out but I was NOT prepared for the short hairs sticking all over my head as it grew back. 

My hyper-sensitive sense of smell stuck around after my pregnancy. It's awful. 

In the first month post-partum I felt crazy clingy with my husband and after that, it's like he couldn't do anything right. (this is probably bigger than just pregnancy related though). 

I did not expect to not want my baby after she was born. I felt so strongly that she would be better off elsewhere, that I should take off and leave her, that I was completely unqualified to care for her. I've a long history of anxiety and depression but I was COMPLETELY unprepared for post partum depression and anxiety.

65,"I know that psychopathy is a spectrum, but he was on the deep end of it. He was physically very good-looking and had surface levels of charm and good manners, and he was very outgoing and social. But his eyes were totally dead, like a shark's, and every now and then I would see a brief flicker of pure disgust on his face before he slid the mask back up. On occasion I wondered why our interactions were so stilted, but I later realized that I layer my everyday conversation with a ton of sarcasm, and he didn't understand it or pick up on the joke, so he was always a split-second behind everyone else's laugh. His eyes would always dart back and forth to the people around him so he could watch their expressions before putting his own in place. When asked about what he was looking for in a woman he would just say that he liked blondes who exercised a lot. That's it. He didn't talk about what kind of personality traits or what sense of humor he was looking for in a partner, or even seem to care about that stuff. Just, blonde and fit. It always struck me as odd that no one else was as creeped out by him as I was, or that they couldn't see the thinly-veiled disdain he seemed to have for everyone around him. I brought up the issue to a friend of mine and he agreed with me, but I had to point out a lot of what I just described and explain my reasoning for him to see it. My friend also pointed out that the man in question didn't actually have any close friends at our school, he just drifted from group to group and was on a superficially good basis with everyone. I'll also add that I don't know if he had actually done anything bad, (even though he reminded me of Patrick Batemen) but I got the creeps being around him. He reminded me of the quote from American Psycho-""there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there."""

Several years in, we began talking more seriously about it and he promised that an engagement (proposal) was on its way. He kept reiterating that by X date we would be engaged, over and over again. The arguments got to the point where we decided to go to couples counselling. 

And today... we're still not engaged. 

It took a long time to get over it and I would say I'm still struggling to come to terms with how he lied to me about when it would happen. 

I took some time off and traveled for a month to evaluate the situation and figure out if after all that he was worth being with. I also took a good, hard look at myself and my values and why being married was so important to me. I actually went off the grid for a few weeks and completely disconnected from tv, internet, cell service and lived in a remote cabin. It was a bit extreme, but truthfully I think I also needed a break from friends and family who were influencing me.

In the end, I decided that he was worth it and that I would still be okay if we weren't married.

75,"Any kind of vaginal “cleansing”. Douching, scrubs, scented tampons/pads, herbal steams (yikes). Ladies, don’t do it. Your vaginas are self-cleaning. Unless you have a bacterial infection (for which you should be using medication), your vagina is fine. If it smells rank, go to a doctor or use a medicated cream. Also, half the time you think it smells “rank”, it just smells like a vagina. Remind your dude partners that their balls don’t exactly smell like a bed of roses, either.

Since pregnancy? Constipation, peeing yourself, sciatica, SPD (pelvic torsion, your pelvis shifts out of place due to baby pressure), hyperemesis (threw up 8-10x a day for 20 weeks), nausea, vision changes, hair falling out, swelling, insane sense of smell, pinched nerves, varicose veins, insomnia.

81,"For the first yet of our relationship, we would get into some heated fights that became unhealthy. We would say super fucked up things to each other and call each other names. I was super insecure and paranoid (because of said insecurity) so I would accuse him of cheating a lot any time he would go anywhere or do anything with friends. 

Anyway, now we have a kid, and we refuse to call each other names or make accusations when we fight. When something gets heated, we take (a minimum of 20 min) break from each other to regroup and then we try to speak rationally and understand one another’s position. There’s lots of healthy compromise in our relationship now and we encourage one another when the other is feeling negatively. 

Even though, we are doing well as a couple overall, it’s really cringeworthy to think about the way we once treated each other and that either of us would allow it. I sometimes start feeling resentful or embarrassed that I didn’t leave when he called me a “bitch” Or I get really ashamed when thinking about when I would accuse him of cheating. It’s tough, because these thoughts follow me sometimes, but when I am truly healing and making an honest effort to forgive, I genuinely try to put myself in his position and gain his perspective. It helps, because I see him as more of a confused, flooded, emotional individual who said some shitty things rather than someone who *did* something to me. 


When you have love at the forefront of your mind, the work can be done. I really do believe that you can forgive a person for *anything*. It really just depends on what you are willing to heal and what your partner is willing to do with you. "

Anyway, one of them I found super sweet and charming initially and this was like 1 month ago. He'd always be considerate of others, even strangers and we ended up really hitting it off. A mutual friend invited us both to a party one night and we were chilling out at some point during it and just having a chat. 

At the time, I think I was quite intoxicated (stumbling around point) but I remember him saying stuff like ""you look tired, you should lie down for a bit"" while trying to pull me to a nearby guest room at the same time. The freaky thing was that I had only had about 2-3 standard drinks worth of alcohol which is waaaaay lower than my tolerance. Another friend noticed though and ended up saving me somehow "
94,"Which is terrible advice because in my experience, men think this means you don’t like them and more importantly, men who are worth being with don’t want to play games. "

97,"I had been talking to this guy from Tinder, then started sending me unsolicited dick pics and insisting to come visit me (after I told him I couldn’t go out because I had sprained my ankle). 

He acted all offended that I didn’t want him to visit me, and told me he was getting back together with his ex. "
98,"We got free personal training at an old job and one of mg extremely-out-of-shape coworkers said something like ""I don't want to get bulky, yknow?"" And his response was to tell her ""No offense, but that's incredibly insulting."" Nobody *accidentally* gets swole. It takes so much intentional work and dedication and dieting to ""get bulky,"" 3 days of lifting 20 pound hand weights and doing 45 minutes of cardio doesn't put you even remotely in the realm of ""getting bulky."""
99,"Similar experience here! There were actually a good amount of very marriageable and lovely boys around when I was in college - guys who were quite sweet and mature from the start and who mostly got snapped up quickly. I was in a LTR at the time so I missed out then.

Relationship fell through right before graduation, and had to wait a bit for the early-twenties crop of men to settle down before another relationship worked out for me. Most of the guys I dated in their early twenties weren't too sure what they wanted out of life yet and it always became a relationship issue."
100,"When I was a kid, I would throw up any time I had to take chew-able Tylenol. Because of that, my parents decided to crush it up and put it in some blue Kool Aid to get me to take it. I knew it was in there, so I still vomited. As a result, anything with that weird flavor that comes with blue-colored drinks/candies/etc. makes me sick."

104,"Wool dryer balls.

I got mine from Trader Joe’s for like $8, and they work so much better than fabric softeners AND they don’t irritate my skin. I sometimes put eucalyptus oil on the ball before throwing it in the dryer and it makes my clothes smell nice. The best part is that each ball can do 10 loads or more, depending on how often it’s used and what temps are used for drying. And when they’re done, they can be used for needle felting projects or as pin cushions, or whatever else.

AND they’re biodegradable. 

So 40+ loads for $8, plus the added benefit of being environmentally conscious and having variety and possible reuse afterwards? Worth it."
105,"26 year old female who just wants to say that reading this thread is amazing. Two of my best friends are 40 and 56 who also felt the same way and having them as “proof” that it’s possible to “get older” and not change my mind is amazing. They helped me a lot, but I’m lucky that that I live in quite a progressive wee town at the bottom of the world that respects my decisions. I’ve never really had an issue with it once I passed the age of 21. It’s something I usually tell people straight up when I first get to know them and they’re all great. 

I have one aunt overseas who is the only person who has ever pressured me and my answer is “sure, I’ll have kids but you have to adopt them and I’ll come visit once or twice a year” which is a bit of a role reversal that shut her up pretty quick. "

108,"I fount a $12 retinol serum at Marshall’s a few years ago and they always have it in stock. That stuff literally TRANSFORMED my skin!
I had a lot of acne scars, extreme combo skin (oily nose/chin and flaking dry cheeks/forehead) and I was getting visible under eye wrinkles. That serum had shrunk my pores, no scars, no wrinkles. My complexion is a lot more even, my skin stays evenly hydrated and I now only get a few spots during my period. Before I always got pimples throughout the month. People always tell me how great my skin looks and I’m always like “dude try the retinol, seriously and you’re welcome”. "
109,"Ya I was gonna say this is like 30% of the guys I go on dates with. I’ll find them attractive and then they’ll say or do something that raises some red flags or just causes me to have a gut instinct that something isn’t right. I try to back away slowly and gracefully so as not to anger the guy. 

As soon as I decide I’m not into someone because they’re creepy in some way (even if it’s something small), they are a threat to my safety. I’ve had just saying “I’m gonna go home now” upset a seemly perfectly nice guy (he was friends with all my friends and I knew his ex), and it ended with physical abuse and sexual assault. When you get a gut feeling, gtfo. "
110,"honestly the first date is super easy to ''pass'' for me. basically anyone who doesn't actively turn me off or scare me got a second date.

basic hygiene okay, could see myself kissing them without wanting to throw up, sound/tone of voice OK, decent conversation, a few laughs. all of those check out and i'll see them again. sadly that seemed to be a pretty tall order back when i was online dating."
111,I like that I'm funny and I like my body and I think my nose and curly hair are the cutest.

115,"My fwb is my ex. We weren't a good fit to date but the sex is amazing. Sometimes we won't kiss on the lips, sometimes we're holding hands in the grocery store acting like a couple. It's all about communicating the boundaries and understanding it can be fluid or set in stone. My only solid boundary is don't fuck another girl then fuck me. Tell me or don't, but don't risk my health."
116,"""Don't be bossy/too aggressive/too demanding""

Too often, the reaction is an overcorrection that makes you a complete doormat. Not to mention no one gives this advice to men.

Plus this plays into the implicit rationale that it's more important for women to be liked than respected. It holds us back and I'm sick of it."

I’ve been perming it my whole life because I was taught to believe that Eurocentric beauty was the “norm” but for the first time in 20+ years, I’ve finally grown my natural hair out. I am in absolute awe with its versatility and how healthy it is. 

I know it’s silly to think of hair as a burden but walking out my house with my afro for the first  time was so liberating lol. 

I feel fantastic in my most natural state. "
122,"Gaping. And I don’t mean that jokingly. It looked completely messed up with a giant, dark and red gaping hole. "

128,"Got interrupted by a jerk during a presentation I was giving to my whole office, including my boss. He even ended his interruption with, “not trying to mansplain but just wanted to make sure everyone understood what you were saying.” I replied with, “Thank you for saying exactly what I just said but slowly and loudly, I did not realize I had to go at a slower pace for the men in the room to keep up.” My boss (an older male) let out a huge belly laugh and started clapping. The jerk who interrupted me stuttered over a come back that never came (Not that anyone would be able to hear it over my boss laughing) and I finished my presentation. Several people told me later that they were glad to see him get put in his place, especially by the youngest, tiniest female on the staff. "
129,"I said something that I did not find offensive at all, but he was very hurt. 

I apologized, we had a long talk about why he felt that way, I understood how much I hurt him even though I never meant to, and apologized again. He forgave me, and we got over the whole thing. "
130,"Yeah, it's totally bewildering. Like, you wonder how they got that way and you just want to be like... dude, why are you sabotaging yourself so badly?"
131,"I was truly taken aback by my anxiety and protective instinct kicking into an almost mania-like state. I was never an anxious person before giving birth, but suddenly holding her, my brain insisted on these horrific, unending intrusive thoughts: “What if a car ran into our apartment right now?” “Is she breathing?” “What if the roof collapses?” “What if that car behind us doesn’t stop?” “What if he drops her?” “What if a car runs off the road and hits us during our daily walk?” And on and on. It still happens (she’s 5) but less...

Physically, I was SHOCKED at how little aftercare you’re given (I’m in the US). I had so many stitches and all they said was, spray this numbing spray whenever you want. And no follow up until 6 weeks later?? I felt so alone. "
132,"Bahaha.  I remember getting the ""no dude will ever want you if you're muscular"" line from ...drumroll please... a personal trainer.  Will forever be proud of myself  for answering, ""Well, I guess I better become a lesbian then.""  and then promptly getting a new trainer.  "

Turns out his dad had passed away unexpectedly the morning after their date. He messaged her and asked if she'd be willing to wait a few more weeks before their next date, and she said yes.

They ended up dating for about 7 months."

154,"I used to work split shifts (8-12 and 4-8) in a call centre. I got offered a lift home after the first shift by a guy I was friendly with and interested in. As we were walking out the building (me in front of him in a narrow corridor) chatting I asked a question but didn't get an answer. I turned around to find he'd disappeared. I was annoyed at myself for thinking somebody could be interested in me (my self esteem was 6 miles underground at this point) and started my usual walk home. I got about 10 minutes down the road to gave this car come screaming down the road and screech to a halt at the nearest layby. It was the guy who I thought had ghosted. Turns out he'd needed the toilet, had been too embarrassed to tell me, thought it was a good idea to slip off and hope I'd figure it out and wait in the carpark. After he realised I'd walked home he chased after me. He must have been interested in me because that was nearly 9 years ago and we've been married for 3 years. "
155,"A wet brush. 
For years everyone told me to try a wet brush for my hair (super thick, wavy, and constantly tangly). I was in a pinch because I'd forgotten my hairbrush the first weeks back in the dorm. I saw a wet brush at CVS and decided to try it (it was $12 so I dont recommend buying one there lol). The first time I used it I HATED it. But then i started using it and realized it's amazing. I now have 3 of them and one small one that I keep in my purse. They're life changing. my hair has far less breakage and is much healthier. 10/10 recommend. "

This happens when I'm absent-minded and they're there to see my roommate - so the attention in general isn't on me. There was one time I took it off, dropped it on one side of the room and went to the other end. I realised it a bit too late and the guy looked at me in confusion.

171,"My nose is bigger. Just slightly, but enough for me to notice and hate it. I also had no idea diastasis recti was a thing, I always thought it was bad diet, stress, lack of exercise that caused ""mommy tummy."" I was very wrong. I strongly encourage any moms to check for it, especially if you carried multiples or had a large baby. Some exercises can actually make it worse, and unfortunately many doctors don't seem knowledgeable about it, or just don't care. I learned about it from other twin moms and have since educated myself a little more about it and spread the word wherever I can. "
172,"I didn't love my baby for several weeks after she was born. She was planned and wanted, but I had a traumatic labour, delivery &amp; recovery. Through all that mess, I wasn't well enough to care for her and to make that connection. One night it clicked for me and I loved her very much from that point forward.

I also grieved over my previous life. I miss being independent more than anything.

I showed her in the Bible where it says if a man is abusive towards his wife the family of the wife is supposed to go and beat the shit outta him and demand better treatment of their daughter. If it continues to happen they're supposed to go back and beat him again and take their daughter, and any children they had together, back into their home. I really like that part of the Bible. Good advice there. "

I told him earlier in the day that I wanted to slow down a bit because I had just gotten out of a relationship. At the party he got shitfaced drunk and spent a majority of it with his tongue down some other girl's throat. I was devastated. I would walk into a room and there they we're, wrapped around each other. Not the best night.  But I couldn't leave because I was my best friend's DD and she was busy hooking up with someone. 

The next day he sent me a pages long text apology trying to explain himself and ask for forgiveness. I was angry and hurt and he understood. He gave me space for a while and then I guess decided he was all in. He wanted to make it up to me, he wanted to fight for me, and he was willing to do whatever to be together. It took a few weeks for us to start actually hanging out again, but it's been four years together now and he's never given me any reason to doubt him. "
176,LOL I thought you meant the blood added a bit of color. Oops.
177,"I've never understood this. If I'm not attracted to you I can't just push past that. I lit a girl friend on fire in college because she tried to set me up with a guy who had horrible hygiene, and she basically admitted that she didn't think I would find anyone else. So I need to ""just give him"" and his b/o and his dandruffy shirts a chance. "

Fortunately my confidence has grown since. These days my European/Asian heritage plays in my favour when it comes to small talk and dating. "
181,"It can also go the other way. Because this advice is given to women, there are a few men who think that a girl is playing hard to get while she is in fact giving signs that she is honestly not interested. So they keep op trying because they think the girl will stop playing hard to get at one point"
182,"At a club I met a very attractive muscular man, when he first approached I was like oh he’s cute etc. He had this predator look in his eyes like I was his prey. Then he suddenly got very aggressive and tried to pull me towards him. Instant turn off, instant GTFO.

When I don’t do these things I am stressed on Monday. Cause guess what? We woke up and go to make lunch and realize we have no food. Okay um I guess I’ll eat raisins cause there’s a bag of those in the pantry. 

I have found out for me that I need to go to bed at 8 so I can wake up at 4, and I need time at home on Sunday. Without those things I am tired and stressed and my time awake doesn’t go very well. But people don’t seem to respect leaving time for down time/me time/catching up on life."

189,"Married for 19 years, unhappily for the last 5 or so.  I don't think he intended to be emotionally abusive, but her didn't seem to get that other people were allowed to see the world differently than he did, and he became critical and controlling.  By the time I said ""I want a divorce"", we'd just moved to another new location for his job, I had no job other than unpacking boxes, and I knew no one there other than his friends. 

So I left -- within an hour of saying those words, I was driving out of state to rent a basement apartment from a friend and with the promise that another friend who was hiring summer freelancers would throw me some work.  Basically, I jumped into freefall, not knowing what I was heading toward, just knowing I couldn't possibly stay where I was and stay sane.

I really thought that I'd build a life for myself in that new city, where I had a few friends.  But though I spent 18 months there, I never got a job offer that would seriously let me pay the rent -- I was just scraping by.  And so when I got a job offer from another state, working for a company I'd never heard of, in an industry I barely knew existed, I felt like I had to take it.  So I leapt again.  

I've been in that 2nd new town for 6 years now.  That first job is long gone, but I've made a career for myself for the first time in my life.  I'm supporting myself quite nicely, I've made all new friends, and I have a pretty darn good life.  It took a while, far longer than I wanted it to, but I feel like this place is home.  

Leaving my marriage was the scariest, bravest thing I've ever done; I could wish I found a new relationship, but I've never regretted leaving that one. "
190,"I just kind of deadpan ""No, I don't think I will.""

Sometimes I point out that having kids is a huge, life-changing thing and yet it's odd that people tend to ask why people *don't* have kids rather than why they *do*. I mean, you don't ask someone why they *don't* own a boat, and that's a way less impactful decision."
191,🙌🏻

I was invited to a dinner with some of my parents friends. I say that Chinese New Year is soon and someone asks me abt it. I start to explain some basic aspects of it. One guy (white, mid-40s, 95% chance he has never spoken Mandarin or been to China in his life) interrupts me and “corrects” me on word pronunciation (in that voice you talk to toddlers to, then he looks around the table with an apologetic look as if he was embarrassed by me) and I stare at him and say “Oh, I wasn’t aware you spoke Chinese! How long have you studied?” In Mandarin. The guy was pretty quiet after that. "

1. Your vision of how women should live doesn't define them. Don't push your unwanted ideals on me.
2. The planet is already overpopulated and we're increasingily running out of space and resources. 
3. I am financially better off without having kids and will be able to live comfortably. 
4. There is more to life than having kids and I can feel fufilled without them. 
5. I don't owe you (my mom) grandchildren, it's my choice and I choose no. 
6. It's not a sin to not want to have kids.
7. I am not selfish that I don't want kids.  
8. Having children is not a tax I have to pay to the world to exist as a woman."

I asked incredulously if she waited in line.  She said not only did she wait in line, she didn't even know what it was.  She just saw a line so she waited in it.

We are looking for something more, but acknowledge that we are not a good fit for that, but the sex is great. So we have an agreement that if one of us gets serious with another person we will let the other know. No sleep overs. No going out on dates. It blurs the lines too much. We have known each other for over a year, and are open and honest with ourselves so there is trust there. Keep it simple. "

In 6th grade, I started learning about the human body for the first time in my science classes. It was the coolest shiz ever, and so I wanted to be a doctor. Then as I got older, people kept saying, “well you can’t be a good mom if you’re a doctor” so I entered college as a pre-nursing student. It took a lot of unfulfilled angst and a GREAT boyfriend (now husband) to help me decide that that was crap and I could do whatever I wanted. 

I’m applying this year to medical school AND having a baby. Will I get in? Who knows. Will I be a good mom? I like to think so. Either way, I’m going for it. "

&amp;#x200B;

FUCK. THAT. That piece of advice is a huge part of why most of my relationship attempts haven't gone well. The only people who you'll scare off when you make your expectations known, are people who aren't interested in meeting them anyway - which is actually what you want! You're weeding out the people who aren't the right fit for you. I've learned that you NEED to make your expectations extremely clear, right at the start of a relationship, if you don't want any surprises down the road. I started hiding my expectations after a few ex-partners successfully convinced me that no man wants a serious commitment, so if I wanted any chance of having any kind of partnership, I had better stop making those expectations clear, and just take whatever bits of affection a man decided to give me. Don't make the same mistake I did... it did not work well.

I read somewhere about not washing with soap in the shower, and just rinsing, and now I *rarely* wash my skin with soap. It's the healthiest it's ever been. No acne, nice and hydrated, smells fine. I use shampoo/conditioner, deodorant, and toothpaste, but as far as skin goes, I totally recommend ditching body wash and cosmetic stuff. Just some lotion here and there in the winter."

So I thought why not try it. Omg best decision of my life. My hair has never been softer and stronger. Almost no split ends. Endless compliments and hair touches. Its awesome. 

It comes in such a small tin can but a little goes a long way. I used it for almost half a year and I barely started making a dent in it and its only around $10 in walmart!"

246,"Speaking as a woman almost 30 in a mid-sized city:

I think I may be a dissenting voice here insofar as I do think many of the more attractive people (not just physically, but generally in terms of personality, intelligence, educational background, earning potential, etc.) pair up in their twenties. There are definitely ""good ones"" left, don't get me wrong, just... fewer of them, and they're likely to be the ""really shy/introverted good ones"" who didn't really put themselves on the dating market in their twenties as much. 

In my early-to-mid twenties, about half of my friends and acquaintances were single or in very casual relationships. By our late twenties/early thirties, I only know... three single people outside of my work. One of the is very much the shy/introverted good guy who is actually hella cool, but doesn't put himself out there at all, and isn't the most immediately charismatic guy. He's the type of dude you only realize is cool after meeting him like, ten times, and actually seeing him open up a little. 

The second single person I know is a serial monogamist and has problems. I like her well enough and think she's maturing, but she's not everyone's version of a ""catch"". She's attractive and has a stable income (although she's unlikely to have much more career development), but she also is quite emotionally volatile and frankly, a little mean.

The last single person I know was in a decade-long relationship and her ex cheated on her. She's beautiful, intelligent, and sweet. She gets a lot of male attention, but none of it seems to be of a very high quality, possibly because she's a little too nice to people. I also suspect she is recovering from some of the emotional damage caused by her last relationship by not getting too serious with anyone new. I'd call her a ""good one"", but also emotionally unavailable.

Obviously, all of that is anecdotal evidence. However, I do believe these three friends are somewhat stereotypical of single people in their thirties. I do know other friends who ended long-term relationships in that late twenties/early thirties stage, but they were generally in another serious relationship after about a six-month mourning period."
247,I personally don’t wear a hijab but I’ve seen so many hijabs slip off or over women’s faces while they’re praying and they’re trying so darn hard to not adjust it mid-salah.

249,"I was 41 and he was 56. He's not just a good one, he's the best one. "
250,Exactly! The negotiation one is particularly infuriating for me. There are studies showing that women are penalized whether they are strong and assertive (“too aggressive” and “not a team player”) or if they are passive (“how can you expect to move ahead if you don’t put yourself out there?”).

First time I was told that was by one of the first friends I told about my then boyfriend taking my virginity by force. I was sixteen and my period was late from it. I was considering going to the police. 


Second time I was 20 and my mom had just died in an accident, my step dad kicked me out and when I went back he beat me up, including holding me off the ground by my neck. I walked to the police station sobbing and sore and that's what the police officer told me. He refused to even take a statement on it. 

Its bullshit. It wasn't a mistake and if you feel comfortable and safe going to the police - do it.

The end of last year, I had added the new things to my goals, and I still got high scores.  Someone else was promoted.  I was not promoted.

I'm not mad at my boss or the company, but it's time for me to leave because I feel it's unlikely I will be promoted.  I began applying to jobs to be a manager elsewhere and my job seeking is going well."

Are they maintaining eye contact, but not too much? Are they good listeners? Are they interested in me? Do I feel comfortable around this dude? 
That’s about it for me. Are they capable adults who can care for themselves and do I feel good being around them."
275,This is a good strategy. I fall for people quick too especially if I think they’re hot or they look good on paper there are suddenly husband material in my head. I used to find myself accepting whatever treatment they gave me even when I wanted more. However I like to try to establish some type of connection if I’m going to sleep with them. I guess it’s a thin line between getting to know them and catching feelings. 
276,"To focus on a man's pleasure before their own wellbeing.

286,Sometimes yes I do regret not leaving. It would have been easier to just walk away. I had a young son to think about too and I didn't want him to not have his dad around. I also still love and care about my husband and wanted to help him get over his addiction and I knew walking out would cause it to get worse. Looking back at it if this was my daughter or a friend I would have told them to run and help in every way possible but I hid what was going on from almost everyone even my best friend doesnt know that it happened. 
287,"I have PTSD as a result of being raped and I was having a really rough semester coping with it and really needed his emotional support. That semester was really hard on him and as a consequence he took his frustration out on me, neglecting me and our relationship. It was the accumulation of passive aggressiveness, rejection and being distant with me that for a while really broke our relationship. The straw that really broke the camel's back was that he made fun of my PTSD when I was having an episode and I thought the relationship was irreparable. 

I tried to break up with him on the phone but he asked to talk about it in person. He showed up, dressed up, clean shaven and a haircut and says he's taking me out to dinner. And then sits there and we talked about it for three hours, about all the pain, and what we could do differently to communicate better. I was really hurt and it took a while to rebuild back up what we had but every concern I had, every suggestion I had made he incorporated it. 

And he was always there for me, when I was having a rough time with my ptsd, whether it was sending me gifs, holding me while I cried and staying on the phone when I needed him. 

Sorry of this sounds one-sided, we have a very well balanced mutually supportive relationship but this was and is our only big fight and it took a lot of trust and effort to address all the hurt over the duration of those couple of months. Now we're better than ever before and looking at engagement rings :-) "
288,"My mom says that to me all the time! And she says the same thing about my hair, which is currently bright yellow. She keeps telling me I should dye it black again when I get engaged so I don't ruin my engagement and wedding photos.

311,I wish my boyfriend was like you. We get into intense arguments when he says something that hurt me and all he insists is “but I never meant to insult you/I did nothing wrong!”
312,Praise the vagina
313,Cheating online and lying about it. He's in therapy now because it's an addiction. I'm understanding of that. We are also in couples counseling. If we didn't have little ones I would have left him but our family means a lot to us. We have to try. 
314,"Roughly 6 months before I started not to feel it when I sat down. The first 2 weeks after birth, I couldn't move off the couch. It hurt so bad to sit down and even worse when I tried to get up because it took the pressure off of it and the hurt returned. It's been 4+ years and I can still feel it when I sit down too rough sometimes. "

It is fascinating to listen to a mixed gender group and hear the differences between who feels entitled to hear their voice heard, and for how long.

323,"He had lied to me for two years that he wasn't doing something that we agreed he wasn't going to do. I finally caught him and he still tried to lie. After he cane clean, it took years of rebuilding trust and having transparency. I still have doubts sometimes and we specifically check in about that issue, but I've long since forgiven him and I trust him again. "
324,"My ""love language"" is words of affirmation, but I could also take physical touch. Both of those concepts are horrifying torture devices to my stoic, Nordic SO.

Having said that, over the years I've learned to pick up all the little ways he *does* show his love and appreciation for me. The ""congrats on \[mundane thing\]!"" flowers. Coming home from a rubbish day at work to a steaming hot bath, a glass of wine, and a tray of snacks. The way he asks if I want something every time he gets up to go to a different room. I've caught him sneaking my towels onto the heated rail while I'm showering. He will plan fancy dates and actually take care of the logistics. We went out for dinner the other week and his dish was blatantly better than mine so he just, like, gave it to me. The way he's fucking stoked to celebrate our anniversary and starts pitching ideas months in advance."
325,"When I got into Law school, my aunt (who had recently finished but couldn’t pass the bar) said some shit like “I hope you’re not just going to get an MRS degree.” And it really rubbed me the wrong way. 

Like I get it, but still. "
326,"I'm adopted. I have so so so many thoughts on people's (often ill-informed, backwards, and pitiful) views on adoption. Acting like adoption is as easy as ""JUST"" adopt makes me so mad. Pretending like there aren't realities to adoption that don't exist in bio. kids is ridiculously inaccurate and condescending. Adopted kids are not some prize for people who can't have their own, and so being told that I can ""just adopt"" or that somehow being adopted makes me less than/ owed children/ not as solid is sad and makes me feel mad, angry, annoyed, put down, and left with the desire to correct people's ugly-ass views on adoption

I opted out of having bio. kids for so so many reasons. My mind didn't change when I first held a baby at age 5. Or when I was 15 and learned about episiotomy/ stretching/ loss of bladder control/ unequal breakdown of tasks in 99% of marriages with kids. Not when I was 25 and had a good salary. Not when I was 35 and it was ""almost too late"" and I ""had the right guy."" 

My reply directly reflects the tone of the asker. If they are nice and just making conversation, cool, I will talk to people of course and be courteous. But if they are douchey, preachy, uncomfortable morons who can't see how anyone wouldn't want a life of suburbia and school districts and juice boxes... I'm gonna answer more curtly and sternly"

329,"Everyone always pushes this idea that you're not ALLOWED to be ugly. Say anything about being ugly, and you will receive a bunch of ""Oh stop, you're beautiful. :-)))"" type comments. Surprise, not everyone is beautiful on the outside. It's a fact. I suggest that people stop trying to fool themselves into thinking they're gorgeous, and look at the things that are actually true. Just because people look better than you, doesn't mean they ARE better than you. They look nice, cool. I look bad, cool. Neither of them are a big deal anymore to me. It's less about accepting that you're ugly and more about accepting that you have value regardless of what you look like. I don't have to be attractive to live my life to the fullest and have fun. No, I'm not happy with the way I look, but I am happy with who I am inside and that's all that matters at the end of the day. I'm not going to play dress up all day for approval from people who hold beauty so high. Id rather be myself than be beautiful. "

332,"Too right. I am the mother of a boy, he's 19 now. I made sure he learned basic cookery and life skills, can clean and do his laundry etc. Now he's at college in a different country, and coping very well by himself. Besides, men who can't do for themselves are putting themselves in a position of dependence on any woman happens to be handy. That's not healthy either."
333,"Never, ever blame yourself for someone else's shitty behaviour!  You are not a bad judge of character...if anything, this speaks to your openness and acceptance of people.

PS - it's always  good to have a wing woman on hand at a party.   In college, we agreed to never let the girl leave with a guy they didn't know.  Drunk friend wasn't always happy with us, but sober friend thanked us in the morning.

335,"""Don't get divorced no man will ever want you, you'll just be someone to warm their bed."" Dad said this to my oldest sister who was in a verbally, mentally and financially abusive marriage for 10 years. Every 3 years we thought they were going to get divorced, did everything to try and save it. They both have/had issues and being with each other was making everything worse. Don't stay with someone you don't have to, you have one life to live and you shouldn't deal with a horrible marriage if you don't have to. "

338,"I have a friend who recently had a house fire.  They lost everything.  It was horrible for a few months...but now, she feels almost relieved to start over.  New clothes, new furniture, and now rebuilding her burned up home.  There are only a handful of sentimental items she wishes she could still have (photos, medals, etc.).

343,"Ok all the top comments are freaking me out just a little so I thought I’d share my mom’s experience after giving birth to me: she lost a ton of weight (like way skinnier than before she got pregnant), stopped having migraines and stopped having excruciating menstrual cramps. So it’s not all bad! (And hopefully my future pregnancy will go like hers did) "
344,He was hot. Told me on our first date his last girlfriend had a restraining order against him and he explained why she got one. She was right to get one. Noped out. 
345,"I had to switch deodorants.  I'd used the same kind for years, but after my son was born, it didn't work.  Luckily, the same didn't happen after my daughter's birth.

Also, my gallbladder went kaput and I had to have it removed five months after my son was born.  It's apparently very common, but it wasn't mentioned in any OB appointments, childbirth classes, or pregnancy books."
346,"How people my age (20) or younger smoke. Everyone knows it's causes cancer and other health problems plus it's ridiculously expensive. I get that it was encouraged with older generations but younger people are better educated. Personally I've been educated my entire life about how bad smoking is, especially by smokers."
347,100% normal.  The oxytocin that's released that causes let down of milk also produces arousal.
348,"Fish fingers. I used to eat fish finger sandwiches a lot as a student because it was so cheap. Like 10 fish fingers for 50p, loaf of bread for 80p, a bit of ketchup and that was enough for lunches for a whole week. Over my first year of university, I probably had that meal well over 100 times, maybe even 150 times.

Now I just can't eat fish fingers at all without associating it with my student years and all the terrible meals I used to eat out of frugality."

352,Yes! Whenever I doubt getting rid of something I think of all the bags full of stuff I gave away last year and realise I have no idea what was in those bags so that just proves it was unnecessary crap. I don't miss any of it.

Prove it!” “Oh you know how some of them have French blood” “you sure you weren’t switched at birth”. It makes me sad sometimes that I’m not viewed as a middle eastern beauty even by my own ethnicity and I’m not viewed as an “all american beauty” by american standards. I’ve always been jealous of the olive or dark skin and dark beautiful hair.  Own it and love it because it’s beautiful

Dermaroller-got mine on amazon; great for scars and pigmentation.

Got2bGlued Gel-amazinggg for my curly hair; water resistant and keeps my hair for days 

Silk pillow case-great to sleep on to minimize frizz 

Website-MakeupAlley-awesome resource for beauty product reviews and swatches 

NYC Eyebrow pencil-awesome dupe for Anastasia BH; super thin and easy to use 

Hybolabo (sp?) hyalarounic acid toner-buy on amazon, plumps skin and minimizes fine lines

“The Cure” facewash-also Amazon; this stuff is a holy grail, it exfoliates your skin and as you use it you can see little balls of dead skin come off!

365,"Groups of guys standing around at college parties can be so, so loud. Screaming/shoving, yelling, spilling their drinks, insulting each other. Slamming beers and chugging straight from the keg. Those are just normal groups of guys having fun at parties. Nobody bats an eye.

Meanwhile, women are expected to stand around and ""chat"". We tell jokes and laugh at each other/rib each other but it's not nearly to the decibel that men do. We sip beer or wine. We're not shoving each other or yelling obscenities like 8-year-olds. If we get drunk and get a little louder, suddenly it's ""trashy"" and ""sloppy"". Drunk girls falling over themselves are ""cheap""/""nasty hoes"", girls who yell at their friends and squeal are ""crazy b***hes"", girls who can chug a keg are ""one of the bros"" and compared to men/butch lesbians constantly. Any uncouth behavior is criticized. With men it's expected and celebrated."

374,Yeah my mom keeps saying this same shit about how when they had my older brother and they didn’t have much money and they made it work and kids these days are too obsessed with making sure everything is “perfect” before they have kids but god she doesn’t seem to realize *how* little money we have and *how* expensive having a kid has gotten.

382,"I’ve talked about this before on here, somewhat...

I did not expect to become permanently disabled and getting ready to start a trial to see if the doctors can put a pain pump in my spine this year. If the trial doesn’t work, I’m looking at brain surgery.

The week after we brought my now 20-month old home from the hospital, I thought that I had the worst migraine of my life and started to get blurry vision. We now know that I had suffered from preeclampsia during my pregnancy, but the doctors missed it. (I had other complications as well, and my son was born by c-section at 35 weeks due to PPROM). I took a migraine pill and went to sleep, and woke up two days later in the ICU, blind, unable to speak, in a tremendous amount of pain, and very confused. I thought I was dreaming and kept trying to wake myself up.

What actually happened is that my husband found me having seizures - status epilepticus actually. My BP had shot way up (I think they said over 240), my brain swelled and I developed PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy), and it caused the seizures. Like a half-hours’ worth before 911 got an ambulance, ambulance got me to ER, and ER finally stopped them. I also had respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, severe sepsis, and I passed the heart attack test (they said there was no blockage but everything put a lot of stress on my heart). Oh, and I had a stroke while in the coma. But somehow I survived and I am incredibly lucky, although my life will never be the same.

Ladies, if you are pregnant and feel off, trust your gut and advocate for yourselves. And check out the Preeclampsia Foundation for warning signs, because a lot of preeclampsia warning signs are exaggerated versions of normal pregnancy symptoms (e.g., headaches, swelling). Partners, advocate for your spouses if they aren’t able to or are too afraid to. I can’t stress this enough. 

"
383,"Oh gawd, I know a man who I thought was handsome and sexy when we first met. Each time after that, he got slimier and slimier. The worst is when he commented that I should do something about my eyebrows. Um, WTF? In the years since, I've heard multiple stories of how he has sexually harassed multiple women we know. Oh, and dude is 45. I'd expect him to have learned non-creepy social skills by now, but I guess not."
384,I had the same thing happen except I needed to base my career on taking care of a severely disabled sibling because my other sibling was so academically talented and intelligent that how could he take on the responsibility? 
385,"I think some dads (not mine) push gender roles on kids. Like won’t take the girl fishing or teach her how to shoot a gun, but will put great effort into doing those things with boys. Or some will be overprotective of their daughters dating but slap condoms in the hands of sons and encourage sex.

My dad always treated me with equality and respect, which is wonderful and what should happen. I’m very happy to have grown up with such a positive role model."
386,"My ex tried to use this shit on me after he lived at my apartment for free and constantly begged me for rides and money and alcohol and cigarettes and would get like psycho angry if I didn't even if I literally didn't have any money (one point I ""lost"" my card and he made me tear the house and car apart and even drive to work to look for it). Oh and he would constantly accuse me of cheating if I had a male friend, or worked over an extra 30 minutes or shaved my legs. But yeah, I'm supposed to stick with him no matter what even though I've known you less than a year and you're literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me"

Just because you “made it work” in debt and poor with your kid, doesn’t mean I should choose that for myself. This is coming from wanna be grandparents! They just want their grandkids already smh "
392,I want someone that makes a genuine effort to get to know me and doesn't just talk about themselves. I am also a stickler for oral hygiene. I expect someone to have a job and some goals as well.

“Ladylike” makes me feel think of the idealized image of the 1950s stay at home wife/mother who baked pies, always had on perfect make-up, and brought her husband his slippers when he came home from work. That woman never complained. That woman never stopped smiling. That women never stressed. That woman never really existed.

I don’t know any women who actually lived this Leave It to Beaver fantasy. My grandmothers did not, nor did my mother or mother in law. These women worked (inside and outside) of the house and did what they need to do for their families and loved ones.

My one grandma was a Rosie The Riveter.

My mother went back to college at 42 years of age because she wanted to prove to herself that she could graduate (she did).

My mother in law took care of aging, disabled relatives even as she herself was aging.

My other grandma worked in a hospital until she was 75 years old.

The last thing that I would want is to be “ladylike”. I like being a strong woman. "

406,"Jokingly putting down their wives/girlfriends as a way to bond with other men.

I work in a very male dominated part of a male dominated industry, and so at work, I'm the only woman in the room 90-95% of the time. One of the biggest surprises was discovering that most of my coworkers will make fun of or even actively put down their SOs as a way to joke around with other guys, often for something belittling or even outright sexist.

Example: ""I'm trying to save for a down payment on a house, but we probably won't be able to save very much unless I hide the credit cards from my wife haha"" - said by a guy who eats out almost every day

These are guys who otherwise appear to be in loving and respectful relationships too, but there's obviously some cultural expectation that you can't appear to respect your wife too much without losing face"
407,"Like more so than before the pregnancy? 

Slightly unrelated, but before my breast implants, my small boobs were not sensitive at all. Afterwards, they were much more sensitive - I finally understood why people liked that area stimulated. Maybe “swelling” makes you more sensitive (in your case, too sensitive to be pleasurable). "

This could possibly make for a great relationship if it weren’t for two things: 
1. He doesn’t want a relationship. 
2. I don’t want a relationship. 

We are adults that understand this and respect that, and most importantly we respect one another. We’ve been doing this on and off for a little over two years and I honestly haven’t had a problem yet. "
412,"Have kids. Not every woman wants kids.. and mind you i'm (25F) open to the chance that i may change my mind... but for as far as i can remember i've never wanted a child of my own. Jusgements get high, but if i don't feel it i just don't! The earth is overpopulated anyways with people having kids when they shouldn't. "
413,"Oh yeah, plenty.

Like the guy I was talking to at a party when I was 18 that started forcefully trying to drag me into a bathroom, despite my telling him that nothing was going to happen between us. His response to my protests was to tell me ""it's okay"" which... from my point of view what he was doing clearly wasn't.

To be honest the macho ""I'm attractive"" sort of guys default make me uncomfortable at this point because I've had almost nothing but negative experiences with them."
414,"Instead of saying 'you're not listening to what I'm saying', I hit them with a ' you're not understanding what I'm saying'. Suggesting they aren't intelligent enough to understand usually gets them quiet."
415,"For me, exclusivity is the main thing that separates a FWB from a boyfriend, but I suppose if you don’t have that level of emotional intimacy/don’t introduce each other to friends/etc I could see how you could have an exclusive FWB situation.. "
416,"I’m hoping that’s not literally on fire. 

But even so, what I don’t understand is no one wants to be the recipient of that. I don’t want you with me because you’re giving me a chance - I want you to *like* me. "
417,"I can see a subtle reminder of gender differences here. I remember someone once telling me that the worst possibility on a guy's mind when he goes out looking for love is rejection, but when a woman goes out in the same capacity, the worst possibility on her mind is being hurt or worse from trusting the wrong guy.

""Do I trust them enough..."" speaks volumes as to how you (and I imagine a great deal of women) judge a potential partner, and it's a great standard. Coming across as genuinely trustworthy isn't something I hear any guy talk about when it comes to dating, so it's a great standard for picking out the bad ones."
418,"A guy asked me to dance at a bar once and I politely turned him down because I was engaged and he responded, ""He's a lucky guy. Have a great night."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly put me in a great mood the rest of the night. I never realized before how I just always expect men to react terribly."
419,"Meundies...the are crazy expensive, but they are advertised as being the most comfortable underwear ever...and they really are. Maybe not exactly what you're looking for but I thought it fit. "
420,"I had this problem too, switched to ""Out the Door"" topcoat and it does just as quick and doesn't peel in sheets like seche vite. "
421,Usually I just sing love songs that are already made and ad-lib my pets names where I can 😂
422,"The guy I lost my virginity to was very attractive. Like could be a model attractive. And we went out a few times, got intimate, and then after we had sex he had a complete panic attack about me getting pregnant and being connected to him. He got me plan B and then blocked me on everything.  I later found out I honestly had no clue who he was because he gave me a fake name and this whole fake persona. He was a crazy liar. I was very creeped out after the fact. "
423,"The last job I quit because of one of my managers. She was a nightmare. If you weren't one of her favorites (i.e. a major suck-up) she would treat you like she was the high school bully. She would single you out for coachings and write you up for things that her favorites were doing. She even had spies. Like she would have people that would eavesdrop on other people and tattle on us when they saw us doing something or saying something ""wrong"", which was pretty much anything even remotely negative about the manager or one of her clique. I and many of my co-workers complained about her for literally years and nothing ever got done. She was also rude to the customers (I worked in retail) and had multiple customer complaints against her. I finally had enough and put in my notice (I was with the company for 7 years). A week before my last day they finally fired her. "
424,Those vibrating scalp massaging brushes (Vitagoods sells one) has made my hair grow SO QUICKLY. I got it because I have dandruff and I thought it would help (it does!) but my hair has grown at a ridiculously fast rate since I've started using it. My hairdresser is SHOOK
425,"I had a coffee aversion with my son even once the morning sickness subsided. Waiting to see if it recurs. I’m still in the throes of nausea.!

But even after my son was born. I can no longer drink coffee black like I used to. I need so much milk "
426,Hijabs are generally supposed to be warm in public or in front on non familial men to my knowledge. However it’s ultimately personal choice usually unless you’re in a strict religion country 
427,"It’s not really specific to mansplaining, but if I’m interrupted I’m a big fan of, “oh - I’m sorry the middle of my story interrupted the beginning of yours”"
428,"Because we knew each other from work, the main rules were just don't mention it at work, flirt at work, organise time to meet at work etc. Second was a personal rule for me which was if I catch feelings (and you will KNOW if you have) then to cut it off immediately. No matter how much they beg and say they dont mind, you'll just get hurt and it's not worth it for the sex. Trust me. 

Other than that, have fun! and you start to feel weird about it or shitty then stop, no point torturing yourself over sex. "
429,"Guys always be complaining about ""the friend zone"" meanwhile they always be ""fuck zoning"" us."
430,"Honestly, I’ll probably never be 100% cool with not being skinny. It’s so engrained in me even though I’ve spent years fighting it. I’m doing...ok.  "
431,"Growing up, my parents criticized every career path I wanted to pursue for one reason or another. That one didn’t make enough money, that one didn’t have enough respect, I would never be able to achieve the third. I like to think it was out of concern for my future. But because of it, nothing interested me, I dropped out of three different community colleges, and resigned myself to entry level jobs and clawing my way through small businesses even though I’d never make the money someone with a degree would. 

Today is my zillionth first day of school. I want so desperately to be a clinical psychologist. So, I want to be a doctor. A real life doctor. 

I don’t even have my bachelors degree yet. But I’m done letting people tell me I can’t do something. 

I’m so excited to restart life on my terms, doing what I want, pursuing that which will make me fulfilled. "
432,"I did this once! Was talking to a dude on Tinder - he was cute, seemed nice, we had some stuff in common. I was enjoying talking to him and was fully ready to go out with him. Then his tone changed and he started getting really overly personal and sexual and invasive - and I was so bummed! So I asked him why he’d cockblocked himself and that I’d been all ready to go out with him until he started that shit. He said he wanted women to know what he was about right off the bat and got mad at ME for leading him on. Sigh."
433,"if I have learned anything in this life, potatoes are always ok- unless they are the red-skinned ones (on my list)"
434,My MIL used to give me garbage (I'm a pretty serious home cook and she game me a plastic cake knife shaped like a hand saw) and I was unsuccessful in trying to get her to stop til my work made us do one of those drink and paint things and I gave her the result and asked about it every time we visited for months. She finally got how obnoxious it was to get shit you hate as gifts and stopped

So far, so good

&gt;cover with socks

Nooooooooo

&gt;Sleep

But how with goosocks on??

Seriously I can't even put on socks after lotioning my feet. Especially at night. I just lie awake until I change my socks."
436,"Same here. I met my boyfriend at 25 and he's just the loveliest person.

A lot of my family have made comments that he's the most ""normal"" (read: will go on dates with me and is kind to me) boyfriend I've had.

Interestingly enough, he's also a bit older than me which, after dating a few guys my age and having bad experiences, was something new and interesting to me. I'd never been attracted to an older guy before, and at first I was nervous about what my family would think because he's a few months older than my older brother.

For all the horror stories about the older partner potentially being the ""dominant"" one, I feel like it's very equal and we both get input on decisions."
437,I think I'd be most concerned with him having no other emotional support.
438,"I think thank this should be rephrased as ""there's no perfect time to have a baby."" Because there's always some shit happening in your life, that's true. But the ""just do it"" part ignores the idea that there may be a better time to have a baby than where you're at now. "
439,Acknowledged that they had been rejected and then wished me well. Classy. A+. 10/10. Would reject again.
440,"YES. I took someone home, ended up in bed together and then he said ""It's ok if you don't want to, I'm not going to RAPE you."" \*weird laugh\*. 

Maybe he meant it as reassuring but it sure killed the vibe for me. It's also the way he said it (like it's funny), but why even say that. "
441,Do you ever regret not just leaving?
442,"“You’ve most so much weight, you look so good!”


It’s because of my chronic illness. It’s all extremely unhealthy, I’d do anything to be able to eat without getting sick. Most days I’m fairly certain I’m dying. But hey, at least I’ll die thin!"
443,"It is very, er, personal, but it works. How it's done depends on the issue you have. I had to use an electric nerve stimulator, which was weird, but it helped me regain about 75% of the function that I had lost. It has at least allowed me to put off surgery for now (which may or may not work anyway, so I didn't want to run and do that only to be left worse off). Feel free to PM me if you want more details. 

**If you're having issues, PLEASE seek out a pelvic floor PT.** My OB completely wrote off my issues, saying ""Well, everything looks fine."" Despite the fact that I couldn't hold my bowels or bladder very well. A surgeon and pelvic floor PT diagnosed my issues in about 30 seconds. 
"
444,"Haha I actually went to Law school to get away from a man. 

But during orientation the president of our school got up and said a lot of us were sitting in the same room as our future spouses for the first time and that also seemed weird af to say. "
445,"My so has a drinking problem. Hes so sweet but when he drinks too much he acts like my abusive ex (not as bad, but a fuxking bully and plays mental mind games and doesnt like hearing no...) so at one point when he was drinking almost a whole bottle of vodka to himself a day, I told him I'd leave him if he couldn't stop. Theres were still trials surrounding this issue, but today he is sober and were very happy together. A few people told me he couldnt do it but hes been committed "
446,"After my epidural wore off for my c-section, my arms were numb from the elbow down. I had deep sensations, but not surface. Then it became tingling all the time in both arms, slightly lessening in the weeks after birth. Eventually it was just my hands feeling asleep/numb all the time. That lasted for months and my doctor shrugged it off, saying it might never go away like that was supposed to make me feel better. Nerve damage is a really likely side effect of epidurals. I still occasionally have weird twitching and nerve tingly-ness in one of my hands 11 years later."
447,"I had about 20 sessions done on my face.  It all came back after a few years.  If you're willing to keep up with it, its probably fine.  For permanent removal I would look towards electrolysis."
448,"Aside from the very creepy interactions I’ve had with some men, the thing I find creepiest is when I tell people, and the guy(s) listening takes the side of the creep.


“How do you know that’s what he meant?”

“Maybe he really does have an interest in xyz.”

“If he was hot, you wouldn’t have minded.”


Dude, I thought we were friends and that you were cool. Now, you can fuck right off."
449,That you owe a guy anything 
450,There needs to be a class or something where we all learn about things people don't talk about.  thank you for actually saying it out loud.  
451,"The desire to have children. 

I believe it exists, of course. I see my friends struggle with it. 

But it sounds *like the worst thing on the entire planet* to me. Literally. 

I don’t get it. "
452,"You made me realise my ""fwb"" is not fwb at all. We even agreed to be exclusive. "
453,Scream when the baby screams. Poop in the bathtub when the baby poops in the bathtub. 
454,"I’ve noticed that a lot of times dads don’t invest in their daughter’s interests if they don’t align with their own. Taking time to try to understand what your daughter likes - even if you think it’s a phase (it probably is) - is the key to developing loving and respectful relationships. 

If boys will be boys and girls will be girls, then it’s no wonder we’re segregated in life like that. "
455,"From the other side -

Had a second date lined up with the girl of my dreams... and I fell asleep. I never panicked like that when I woke up. I was really freaked the fuck out. Of course, she didn't respond to my my attempts to reach her and I was devastated. 

I was persistent, and eventually she agreed to another date. She was pretty convinced I ghosted. I told her I would've come up with a much less lame excuse than ""falling asleep"" if that were the case. Thankfully, she agreed. "
456,"Holy fuck 

Get it girl, flaunt those guns "
457,"He forgets so much, that I basically have to remember it all for us both. It's irritating, but it's him."
458,Advocado anything. I like guacamole so I thought I would like avocados. Advocados taste like moist green to me. And yes I know green isn't a flavor but if it was advocado would be on the dull end of that flavor.
459,"See, this sounds like a relationship to me! "
460,"Wow, that doctor! I'm the youngest of three girls. I was sitting at a table at a wedding reception with my parents and a younger couple once and they were talking about kids. My dad tells the other man that they ended up with three girls after trying for a son and the other guy goes on this rant about how awful daughters are and how that must be horrible (mind you, I was sitting right there!) Needless to say, my dad was not amused by this guy and told him very clearly and firmly that having three daughters may not have been his original desire but that he would not want a life without any one of us. "
461,"People act startled when they find out I've had my tubes tied, and they always feel the need to tell me how permanent that is. Yeah, so is a kid. "
462,Right!! This thread really made me appreciate the fact that I have zero desire to have children.
463,"If can answer for my mom : 

&amp;#x200B;

She became allergic to the sun after my sister's birth. Before she had normal sunburns. Since my sister is born, she break-out in hives.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, she had allergic reactions to some meds I don't remember right now after my birth. Same deal. She took it before me, and it went fine, not even one side-effect. Since I'm born, she have big rashes if she ever take it."
464,"Women are literally not allowed to have bodily functions without being seen as disgusting by their male counterparts.

Our deodorant is called Secret, because, shhh, we can’t let the men know that we sweat too!

Pads and tampons are things to be hidden and whispered about, and god forbid someone find one in our bags. All hell would break loose.

Products like VIPoo are marketed to women in flowery pink bottles because even our poop is supposed to smell like roses, apparently.

Skincare has to be done in a locked bathroom, or after everyone else has gone to sleep, because we’re not allowed to have imperfections but nobody’s allowed to know that we have to put effort into making sure of that.

We aren’t just discouraged from taking up space, ladies. We’re conditioned by the world around us to simultaneously be something subhuman in mentality and something godlike in every other aspect, and I think that’s really fucking sick."

This always kills me to read."
469,"I’m going to venture outside the beauty products and recommend some household helpers:

Awesome is a degreaser you can pick up from the dollar store, dilute and stand back in amazement. Shit works, yo.

If you haven’t used a magic eraser yet, you need to get on this.  But they break down fast and can be expensive.  You can get dozens of them for cheap by ordering melamine foam block.  

Baking soda is a staple, amirite?  Your teeth, your stove, your grout... all made better by sodium bicarbonate.  But have you tried it in anything but baked goods as a raising agent?  It is an amazing meat tenderizer that helps kick in juices.  Up your stir-fry, cutlets, fajitas, etc. with this little bit of food magic.

I’ve got more, but I suspect you’d rather hear about men’s skincare products as fixing agents.  :). Nivea balm FTW.
"
470,"I asked my grandparents why they didn't want a dog (too much work, etc). When they realized the analogy, they became upset, saying how the two were incomparable. 

I don't understand why people want to desperately convince me to have children. I don't want them. Sure, it's possible my opinion will change, but please for the love of god don't tell me that it WILL change. You don't know that better than I do. 

It seems so bizarre to me that people expect women to have children. It is indeed life-changing, but not a change everyone wants or needs in their life, for a myriad of possible reasons..."
471,"I really dislike compliments that insult my past self, because the implication is that they were thinking all that stuff about me before. Like ""You look so fit and healthy now"" or ""You have a much better sense of style now"" or ""Wow, what happened to you?"" (if they haven't seen me in awhile). "
472,"""Yes, any adult should be able to do it at the minimal""

Also on a funnier note:
""I'm sorry were you looking for a maid/cook/cleaning service"""
473,"I had something similar happen. Went home with a guy who was into bondage like me. He had me tied up and gagged, I was super turned on. Then he says “you’re so helpless I could rape you all night if I wanted”. Instantly turned off and I wanted out of there.

Like you had me guy! You had me tied up naked in your bed and I would’ve let you do my practically anything to me consensually. But you had to mention rape."
474,"Not me but a friend.

My friend was on a rugby team during uni when she didn't wear a hijab. Her former teammate recently got married. At the wedding, the bride spontaneously decided that the old team should play rugby out on the grass. My friend, now wearing a hijab, agreed and it wasn't long before she was on the ground with her hair unfurled around her. She said none of the guests knew how to react and she quickly ran to the nearest bathroom laughing. 

What a fun idea though, glammed up women in dresses playing rugby. "

He would NOT eat potatoes, fancy, plain, big small, or in between. Loved hamburgers, wouldn't eat fries. No. Potatoes. No fancy garlic parsley mash. No potatoes. "
477,"Showering. Not like sexy time showers, just scrub my back and I’ll scrub yours type showers. It’s my favorite thing."
478,"I think it's very dependent on the culture where you are. 

I grew up in rural Kansas, where the attractive (by all of the metrics you mention) partners were all paired up by their early 20s (every single one of my classmates who stayed in our hometown was married by age 25. That's not an exaggeration). 

Now I live in a major city, and people don't seem to get that feeling of wanting to pair up until their early 30s -- I know tons of great, attractive-in-many-ways people who are single and in their 30s here, whereas back home that is definitely not the case. Here, if you're married before 28 or so, it's a bit shocking to people. "
479,I want to love this product so bad. I LOVE how white they make my teeth but I had to stop using them because they made my teeth so sensitive! 
480,My collar bones have a nice curve and I am very happy to see them again! 
481,Dude that’s me with watermelon vodka. The first time I ever got sick from drinking was with it. Few days later I went to chew my favorite gum (watermelon cantelope flavored) and about vomited at work. 😬
482,That's the cutest shit ever omg
483,"I retained a horrible gag reflex.  Ya know how you can casually put something in your mouth/teeth to hold it or carry it?  Can't.   Makes me barfy.

486,"I watched a liposuction surgery when I was about 13. 

My sister (who was 10) and I attended this field trip thing to a science center in Harrisburg PA. We had the option to watch a live stream of a liposuction surgery and, being very tomboyish girls who thought gross stuff was cool, were very excited to see the insides of a human. 

They had those mini cameras that they can put inside people during surgery to see what’s going on, and they actually streamed that footage too, live. Since it’s a liposuction, we saw a lot of human fat. And when they removed it it just kinda sat on the table next to them in lumps.

Later that week our mom made a great cold-weather dessert that the whole family always loved: bread pudding. The texture and appearance was too similar to the human fat we’d seen extracted from a large woman days before. It’s now ten years later and if there’s ever bread pudding in close proximity we’ll smirk at each other and say, “mmm, know what that looks like?” "
487,"Yes, exactly. I have been penalized heavily in my workplace for all of this. I literally can't win. My work is invaluable and I'm not easily replaceable but try telling that to the kinds of men who treat women like disposable punching bags.

Incidentally, my big career goal has been make myself valuable and employable enough that I can change companies *easily.* I've worked really hard at this. I never want to be trapped in such a toxic situation ever, ever again."
488,"In college, met a guy I really liked. We talked and hung out on campus for a few weeks and then he asked me out on a date. I agreed, and we set it up.

He was going to pick me up at my dorm so I got all ready and waited for him to come. 30 minutes after he was supposed to pick me up I texted him asking him wth where are you. He didn’t respond.

An hour an a half later I get a text that he’s here for our date. I walk outside, ready to let him have it. 

Immediately he’s apologizing and extremely embarrassed. He told me he was helping a friend with homework and left his phone in his car so he lost track of time.

Okay but 2 hours of not checking a clock while doing homework?! I was not convinced. But he seemed sincere so I went on the date anyway.

I married him last year and turns out he’s a super big nerd who loved helping people with homework so his story checks out. "

495,"This has only happened to me once, but it was a really weird experience. Met this guy at a convention, he immediately looks me up and down and it gives me the warm fuzzies. I invite him and his family back to the place my family was staying so we can all have dinner together. He and I are talking and everything is going well, I'm really vibing with him and thinking he's crazy attractive. Then, he says he's going to draw me a picture. He presents it to me and it's a skull sticking out of the ground with a flower growing out of it. I thought it was a little weird, but whatever. Then he says, ""I'm tired of this small talk, let's talk about deeper things."" Cool, dude really wants to get to know me. He asks, ""Have you ever wanted to hurt someone?"" I'm like, ""what? Why??"" And his response was something like, ""I want to know how someone has hurt you to the point that you wanted to hurt them."" I noped out of that real fast. We actually stayed friends for a while after that because we really did get along well, but I always had remind him that we would never work because he would make comments. And he still loved to ask really odd, personal questions. I was still really attracted to him, but the thought of either one of us ever pursuing anything gives me a REALLY bad guy feeling, even to this day. "
