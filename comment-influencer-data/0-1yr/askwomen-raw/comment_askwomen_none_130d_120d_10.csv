I was told to go change. So I just pulled the skirt off right there and was like, okay is this better? And I was told yes. Idiots."

3,"Does role-playing count? I can't make it 5 minutes in without laughing. It feels like I'm starring in a really bad B-rated movie that went straight to DVD. Bless all actors and actresses, porn and all."

8,"I worked at a university, and part of my work was doing field trips with students. The students were 19-20 years old on average, I was 28. Nonetheless, people would mistake me for one of the students.    
For example, we'd visit a production site and get a tour. In the middle of the tour, the guide would ask me if I think I'm too smart to pay attention and take notes. Well, I was paying attention... to the students I'm responsible for."
9,"Well I was drunk eating enchiladas on his bedroom floor when I paused, stared at him, and proceeded to say ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Thank the liquid courage for that.

He wasn‚Äôt as wasted as I was and smiled and said ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù

Not as romantic but he‚Äôs my fianc√© now so obviously something in the enchiladas went right ."
10,"A teacher who didn't know me yelled at me for making tea in the teachers' lounge. I told him I teach physics, and he looked for the nodding approval of the other teachers present until he backed off. Didn't even apologize."
11,Sex on the beach. It's just a recipe for sand EVERYWHERE
12,"99% of shops that sell salads and bowls are overpriced, overspiced, trendy hipster nonsense.

13,My boss told me off for wearing leggings to work‚Ä¶whilst she herself was wearing them!
14,"Ariel didn‚Äôt leave the sea for Eric! She was obsessed with life on land waaaaay before she saw him. She had a damn cave of wonders dedicated to human life for gods sake! I mean, if I were obsessed with Japanese culture and filled my home with Japanese things and fuckin wrote songs about it I would be pretty stoked to meet a hot Japanese dude. 

Then her dad, THE KING OF THE DAMN OCEAN, throws a temper tantrum and destroys all her stuff she‚Äôs spent basically all of her time and effort collecting. 

I‚Äôm not saying running away to human life was a wise choice, but SO MANY people say she abandoned her life for a man when in ‚Äúreality‚Äù he was only a part of it. She was strong willed and determined to do what she wanted to do. She took shit into her own hands even though it was a poor decision she didn‚Äôt just sit around like ‚Äúoh poor me my dads so mean.‚Äù 


TL;DR Ariel didn‚Äôt abandon her mermaid life *just* for a man."
15,"Not me, but my younger brother.

Senior year of HS @ a Catholic school. Gets demerits for wearing the wrong socks bc they went around and did a sock check (forced boys to pull up pant leg to see if they were wearing dress socks or gym socks). Brother had gym socks bc he was 17 and who gives a shit bc they weren‚Äôt visible (and also brand new, clean, etc.)

Next week was parent/teacher night. Mom goes in and teacher comments/brags about how many boys they ‚Äúcaught‚Äù during the recent check.

Mom says ‚Äúglad all of the drug use and teen pregnancy problems at Catholic School are handled so now we can give boys demerits for wearing socks.‚Äù

Demerits got taken away."

17,"Reverse cowgirl does nothing for me. Sure it gives him a great view, but I'm stuck looking at his feet!"
18,The straps of my tank top were two fingers wide and not three fingers wide. They were three fingers wide on *my* hands but not the assistant principals hands.
19,"I got reprimanded by another teacher for using the printer!

22,"Start reaching out to them in a low key way and invite them to something concrete. Send them a message like ""Hey I know I've been distant lately but I'd really like to catch up, do you want to go grab a drink at the pub/coffee at x cafe/food at x place?"". Don't expect too much, some people may not want to reconnect, but I suspect if they were actually your friend before they will."
23,"I'm an ESL teacher and have studied linguistics. I'm usually against prescriptive grammar and its hardline followers.

But damn if ""would of,"" ""could of,"" and ""should of"" don't annoy me as if they were the written equivalent of nails on a chalkboard!"
24,My former boss in HS did the same thing with us.  We were lifeguards and she didn‚Äôt like us wearing the short shorts over our one piece bathing suits. So I took off the shorts and only had the bathing suit on like ‚ÄúDoes this make more sense Tina!?‚Äù
25,"My favorite kind of role play is the silly kind! The first time I tried dirty talk I called my partner's penis ""Godzilla"" my mouth ""Tokyo"" and told him to rampage me. One of my fondest foreplay memories is when I tried to convince my husband to let me put my tongue in his tooth gap, which makes him feel awkward and squeamish. We were cracking up as I used lots of gentle kisses and my best sultry voice to try to persuade him to ""let me tongue fuck your tooth hole,"" and ""let me slide in that gap, baby,"" with such phrases as ""I just want to feel myself inside you"" and ""a sexy gap like that was made for fucking."""
26,"No, Jack could not have just climbed up onto the door that Rose was floating on. He tried and the door sank because it could not support both of their weight. It's not a matter of whether there's enough space on the door, it's a question of buoyancy. Stop saying Jack could have lived if only Rose would have just made some room!"
27,"I was 18 and went inside a pizzeria to pick up an order. The guy at the counter said ""What are you? 15? 14? You can't take this pizza.""

I honestly don't understand why I couldn't take the pizza, 14 or not. It was a damn pizza.

I think the guy was just being a douche on purpose and just condescending. I know I look younger, but it's amazing how many people think they can be dickwads because you *appear* younger."
28,"I accidentally sent a flirty and provocative text meant for just my husband to a group text with my inlaws. I quickly got a private text from my husband panicked telling me that I made the mistake of putting that in a group text. My inlaws pretended they didn't see it, but they acted a little awkward around me for a few days lmao."

36,Rub a wet balloon against your skin and that's what it feels like.
37,Pets should be mutually agreed upon by all who will be caring for them and NEVER A SURPRISE GIFT
38,"Obsessively thinking. Once my mind get's attached to something that bothers me, triggers me or scares me - my mind will go on and on with story telling, my own story, what I create around it, and I make it real. I can then act irritable and discontent, making it hard to let go of or see the reality of the situation. 

Meditation &amp; journaling is key.

&amp;#x200B;

Also eating cookies. I LOVE COOKIES! I can't keep them in the pantry, I can go through an entire bag of Oreos in one sitting."
39,Biweekly is a stupid word. Why the hell does it mean both twice a week and every other week? It‚Äôs obnoxious and irritating and even if I can figure out what you mean by context it‚Äôs a bs word.
40,"My boyfriend wrote ""I love you"" at the end of a Valentine's day card when we'd been dating for about 5 months. Since he wrote it instead of saying it, I felt too awkward to say it back... I was like, how do I respond to this? Should I write ""I love you"" on a post it and slap it on his forehead? I ended up feeling awkward and almost saying it but chickening out at least a hundred times over the next 2 months. Then I finally just blurted it out one day at a random time and he said it back and we have probably said it every day since (2.5 years later)."
41,"We'd been seeing each other for about a month (we'd been friends for several years before) and were both anxious to hear it. I wanted him to say it first so I was trying to be quiet about it. But, he went to drop me off and I forgot I was waiting for him to say it and it came out of my mouth as I tried to get out of the car. He pulled me back in and asked what I'd just said. I got really red and embarrassed. It turned out, he was really anxious to say it and had been thinking about it all day, but had been advised to wait a little longer to not overwhelm me since I was younger than him and I was still recovering from a long term relationship but starting to be at the point of testing the waters again. It went wonderfully and we had our wedding basically a year later."
42,"I have very thick, wavy hair bordering on curly, and I have been dress coded occasionally for being ""unkempt"" just due to my natural hair.  Usually I am told to ""brush and wash"" it which is ridiculous because it *is* washed and brushed.  I end up tying it back so the texture isn't as obvious.  Unsurprisingly, the people who dress code me always have thin, straight hair.

Even though you normally hear of this happening to POC, I'm white."
43,"I tell my husband I am a perfect example of Newton's law. Once I'm down, I'm down, but if you keep me moving, I can go and go."
44,"Ooh these instances make me so mad. Working at a high school I‚Äôm often told to go get a tardy pass in a condescending tone. It‚Äôs like you get to see why students disrespect teachers. It‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre disrespectful from the get go! I understand the reasoning to be firm with kids but even if I was a kid, I could have a pass and I could be asked for it nicely. üôÑ"
45,I prefer that the conversation flows naturally so I don‚Äôt go in with any set expectations about what we‚Äôll discuss

48,"A shirt. 

Literally 3 other girls were wearing the **exact same shirt**, but I had larger breasts so the principal (high school) came up to me and said, ""you're being distracting. cover up. there are sweaters in the office if you don't have one."" 

Then I got lectured about how there is a time and a place for ""certain attire"" and that I was wearing mine at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and if I wanted respect I would need to dress in a way that offered me respect. When I pointed out that I was not the only one wearing that shirt, and that I deserve respect regardless of my attire or breast size, I was given detention. 

But when girls started walking in, during summer, with shorts that hardly covered the bottom of their butt...no problem there."
49,Messily. Lots and lots of tears and sadness. It gets less awful with time but it is still a terrible loss because pets are so wonderful. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
50,"On my birthday, in my bed laying next to each other. I had been ready to say it for weeks and wanted to say it that day in particular but he beat me to it.

54,"I accidentally screenshot a Snapchat conversation in which the guy told me I was perfect and other amazing things. 

I‚Äôm so dumb I didn‚Äôt know it alerted people of that. 

He messaged me right away asking what I took a picture of. 

I told him I couldn‚Äôt not save an amazing compliment like that. 

He said he loved how appreciative I was and still seeing each other currently :)"
55,"TLDR: apparently pencil skirts and high wasted pants on a 21 year old body is provocative and inappropriate work attire. ü§î

I was mortified when this happened, as I had graduated the year before and had just started my first real job.

I never had issues before I had internships each year during my studies over one of my longer uni vacations.

I had a work wardrobe I built up from my 1st year of uni. So I put a lot of thought into it and spent some money on quality classic pieces.

I had 25 pieces I mixed and matched. 

Pencil skirts and straight and wide high waist pants, collared shirts and wrap dresses, blazers and blouses. Shoes were simple, a heeled pair of Mary Janes, espadrilles mid-platform, ankle boots and calf boots all closed toe. Colours I went with we're dark blues, reds and blush pinks. Shoes were brown, camel, nude colours.

Please explain to me how any of that can be provocative. Not my fault I was 21, tall and in shape. My clothes pretty much covered 70-80% of my skin. Nothing was see through or overly tight fitting either I made sure to balance things out. I never showed legs or chest.

I was pissed as they felt the need to call me in and have this conversation. Luckily I didn't hestitate to let the specific director know I felt disrespected and didn't realise my colleagues were oogling me. (Older creepy asshats.)

The next day the director apologised and shifted blame to HR as they advised him to deal with me directly.

I went to the HR director who is a woman and asked her why she felt the need to not address me instead of having one of the company directors I report talk to me about work appropriate attire? 

Almost 10years later and clearly I'm still pissed üòÖüòÖüòÖ. I resigned a few months later,  was just not a good fit in terms of office culture."
56,"Cleaners. Janitors, maids, housekeepers etc. They serve an essential function, particularly with regards to places like large office or civil buildings. They work incredibly hard and are often treated like part of the scenery."
57,"I got called a slut once, for not fucking a guy ü§î"
58,"Not so much these days, but people used to assume I was a teenager when I was in my twenties.

When I first started teaching in a high school, I was chided by a teacher for being out of uniform. Kids also used to guess my age as 18.

I‚Äôve had so many double-takes when I mention my kids. People assume I‚Äôm not old enough to have kids?

When my eldest was a baby (I was 23), I had a couple of people being suuper supportive and encouraging. Turned out they thought I was about 16."
59,"My boyfriend enjoyed the feel, and so did I - but I couldn‚Äôt get past how weird it felt staring at his feet. 

It was a bit of a turn off for me."
60,Yeah I see that occasionally. I don't care
61,"Standing up 69.  My husband's a strong guy so he just picked me up but...its kinda hard to be held upside down without it hurting.  

And I'll agree tentatively with shower sex.  Except we just bought a new house with a shower that's 3'x8' and so I think that could work better, we just need to try it."
62,Cumming on my face. Its hot and all but all it took was one misplaced shot in the eye for me to never want to do it again.
63,"I double texted a dude with like a litany of questions of all the small things he'd mentioned he might do after we parted ways after a 2-day date. It was like,

""Haha yeah have a nice day at work!""

""Hey, so did you apply for that job? Did you have a tomato salad? Were the tomatoes ripe? Did you catch the last ep of [local TV show we used to watch]? Still planning that trip to Croatia?""

omg I came on way too strong, I swear I wasn't as obsessed with him but that litany of questions makes it sound like I was memorizing his every word. He ghosted me for two weeks, then came back with ""yeah I got the job but things got busy, I don't think I can focus on dating right now"". A polite ""no"" but fine, whatever, at that point I knew what was up. I deleted his number, deleted him off my social media and that was that."
64,"For me, it was smoking. Finally managed to quit 4 1/2 years ago after smoking for over 20 years."
65,"My boyfriend and I were on a road trip, we make a stop. I‚Äôm snacking on some jerky while he‚Äôs getting the gas. He comes back to the driver seat and says ‚ÄúJ-Bad, I can‚Äôt hold it any longer I‚Äôm in love with you and I‚Äôm crazy about you, and wanted to give you this‚Äù and gives me a beautiful opal bracelet. All while I have a mouth full of jerky. In shock and through jerky, I manage ‚Äú...I love you too!‚Äù And tear up.

He passed away almost a year ago. He had his issues, but he was such a thoughtful, sweet human being."
66,"In 1975 I was fired for insubordination, for refusing to wear an upper foundation garment aka a bra. My bra size at that time was a 32 AAA. They don't make that size, because what's the point? 


I found another job the very next day and have never had anyone say anything about it. 


I don't shave, I don't wear pink, I don't wear dresses, and I had a mastectomy but did not get reconstruction surgery because what's the fucking point?"
67,‚ÄúOh shit the lighting in here is great. I‚Äôll take one when she leaves so it‚Äôs not awkward‚Äù
68,"I‚Äôm going on 42 and although children were never part of my agenda I did think I‚Äôd get married at some point. All of my friends have been married except me. 

It‚Äôs not easy. I‚Äôve obviously had failed relationships. I‚Äôve tried to learn and grow  from all of them but always wonder what‚Äôs wrong with me that it has never happened for me. 

When I was a teenager I got this tiny book on palm reading that said if these lines on the side of your hand down from your pinky were far away from your pinky you‚Äôd have to wait until late in life to find love. Mine were further away than my friends so I blame that. I have to tell myself things like that so I don‚Äôt put so much weight on there being something inherently wrong with me. 

One thing though. As the only single person in my friend group and work group-it‚Äôs tough. I know a lot of married people say they‚Äôd give anything to have their freedom again but man, dating is awful. And loneliness is a killer. Remember your single friends. And not just as the third wheel."
69,The worst was when I opened the door to a knock and they asked if my mom or dad was home. I was 28. I can't wait until I'm 60 and people stop telling me how young I look. It's not a compliment.
70,Fun fact: hot/cold lube once stripped all my nail polish off
71,Threesome. Not for me. I want all the attention. Sorry not sorry.
72,"I am a 19 year old college freshman student. I had a presentation once and a few of the other students thought I was a professor....my actual professor yesterday thought I was a high school student taking dual credit :I 
lesson: I am infinite ages"
73,I insist on pointing out when women in movies/tv have perfect hair and makeup despite being put through the ringer. Ex. Bryce Dallas Howard in the latest Jurassic Park. Girl outruns a volcano and gets dunked into the ocean but her makeup is completely unaffected.
74,"Were you always like this?



I‚Äòve been gradually losing my energy in past few years, always physically tired and also tired of other people‚Äôs shit in general. People I knew for longer didn‚Äôt really notice it that much but new acquaintances did.
Turned out I had *very* low iron levels, got it treated (iron infusions) and I‚Äôm feeling **much** better now.



Sorry if this is not the kind of answer you wanted, but I‚Äôd try to find out whether it‚Äôs not just a physical illness at first."
75,Not wear makeup everyday
76,"Ever had bath sex? My ex and I put some pretty smelling, idk, stuff in the water for a relaxing time together but ended up trying sex. I was on bottom and the waves of water kept slapping me in my face, getting in my eyes and mouth. It burned and was suffocating.

78,"The Myers-Briggs test is just a ""smarter"" sounding horoscope."
79,"Today I am working on the back half of a blanket that is going to ultimately be a wedding present to my lil brother. It was SUPPOSED to be in October, but they're talking about eloping due to the bride's mom deciding that their wedding should in fact be her wedding version 2.0. Which means they'll be married in June. And I'm mad about that because there's zero chance this thing gets done by June. I already called him an assbutt about it but I can't gripe at him too much or else he'll stop sending me pictures of his new corgi puppy as punishment"

82,"I want to know things they‚Äôre passionate about, even if it‚Äôs something I find boring normally, because their passion makes it much more interesting to me! And I‚Äôll learn something new, I love that."
83,"People who have a bone to pick with *everyone*.

Let's just say this: if you smell shit everywhere you go, you best check the bottom of your shoe."
84,"I got mine completely removed at the suggestion of my amazing doctor. It‚Äôs more effective and lessens your chances of ovarian cancer. I am childfree by choice, and my doctor was the first to ever really listen to me. 

The surgery could not have been easier. I had it 3 years ago (at age 28) and have had no side effects. Scars are barely noticeable. The surgery itself caused me no pain; just a few hours of mild discomfort due to the air they use to inflate your abdomen for the surgery. I was shoveling snow a few days later... even though I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been‚Äî we can blame that on my crappy roommate at the time!

In any case, whatever your situation, it is a safe, reliable procedure that I HIGHLY recommend!"
85,"I have a terrible history of sending texts (specifically pictures) to the wrong people ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I recently sent a picture of my ass in some sexy undies not to the guy I‚Äôm seeing but to my half sister! I wanted to die, but she took it pretty well.

86,"If a store sells womens pants, they need to sell a variety of inseams.

Also, womens pants need to have the inseam clearly labeled.

Also, fuck womens sizing. I want waist sizing in inches WITH inseams listed in inches. None of this 12L, 10R, 4P, etc nonsense. I demand clearly defined sizes! And pockets, dammit! Real, clearly defined sizes and actual pockets!"
87,"People think I'm mad or I dislike them when in truth, I'm just chillin and it probably has nothing to do with them. My tone or body language is more laid back and unlady-like so people assume that I'm not in a good mood or a sour pus. I just don't like making a scene or being loud."
88,"When my now husband and I were dating for a few months, I played an album for him that I loved but he hadn‚Äôt listened to yet. We were cuddling on his balcony, enjoying the music and the view. As a kinda slow song ended, I felt his heart beat faster (I was leaning on him with my hand on his chest) so I looked up and asked if he was okay. He looked in my eyes and said ‚ÄúI know you might think I‚Äôm crazy, and you don‚Äôt have to say it back, but I love you.‚Äù My heart was full hearing him say that so genuinely, and I was so happy to say it right back. 

A few months after that, he picked me up from the airport after a trip where I didn‚Äôt see him for a few weeks, flowers and other gifts in hand. Among the gifts was a vinyl of the album we were listening to that night, he brought me home and we danced to the vinyl in my room. 

He‚Äôs so sweet to me. I love him with all my heart."

91,"Wearing a fitted T shirt, and midi skirt (I was working on a call centre and most staff dressed casual)

I had previously asked hr if the fitted t was ok and was told it was totally fine - so I went ahead and brought it in a few colours

The midi skirt was the same style as one the manager had previously worn.

I wore the skirt and t shirt together one day (hadn‚Äôt worn the skirt before) and was told if I came in dressed like that again I would be sent home."
92,"A couple months ago I sent an angry text and then spent the next 15 minutes sending apology texts. I was very very drunk and was being totally ridiculous &amp; over-the-top.

I recovered by becoming a hermit for 2 days and then pretending like it never happened.

The person who was the target of my ridiculousness and I are fine and never talked about it. I think I made a bigger deal about it than they thought it was."
93,"I'm always asked what I'm studying in University, I'm 29 and have been working for 6 years now.

94,"I wasn't allowed to wear a coat inside even though the trailor classroom's heater was broken and the windows and door were drafty, so I refused to take it off and I got in trouble for it. I wasn't the only miserably cold student. The school was afraid students would be smuggling drugs and weapons in their coats. After enough parents complained to the school, we were allowed to until the heater was fixed."
95,This thread has just quintupled my hills
96,"Late 30s, get mistaken for 20s a lot. Many men I encounter through work dont treat me as capable and knowledgeable on account of my perceived age."
97,I‚Äôve never understood the philosophy of treating students like they‚Äôre guilty until proven innocent. It creates such a hostile environment.
98,I only care if they‚Äôre blocking access to that sink in which case I feel irritated.

113, This is my life currently. I work for a university and my students are 19-23. I'm 27 and the security around campus always mistake me for a student whenever I attempt to park in the staff parking. I have to pull out my ID every damn time I have to park to prove I'm not a student.
114,"I was a lifeguard at a camp when I was in high school too. For better or worse, I also happen to have pencil-eraser-size nipples and had amply large (but not huge) breasts at that age. So not only did I fill out my speedo but also, whenever I had to go from the pool outside to the Mess Hall or other air conditioned area, it was cold... and, well it showed! So this one middle aged lady supervisor seemed to not like that very much but there really wasn‚Äôt anything I could do to help it. She would comment often, pulling me aside like all serious. She asked me once if I was wearing a bra, which I always did if not in my swimsuit. She eventually wrote me up for it as a ‚Äúdress code violation‚Äù but I wore the exact same suit as the other staff. Mine was the right size and in decent shape so idk what I was supposed to have done differently. Wear a bra with my swimsuit?!

In retrospect, I feel harassed."
115,"I was the biggest slob as a teenager now my house is tidy but lived in. 

Start small 

-make your bed EVERYDAY 

-wash all dishes wipe down counters or stove before you go to bed. 

I find starting the morning with a clean kitchen then seeing my bed made makes me want the other things clean too. 

Keep cleaning things organized to make 5 minute jobs easy to to do

Example I keep a bottle of rubbing alcohol with a spray on it with a roll of paper towels under my bathroom sink so I I can wipe down the sink, counter and mirror quickly.  
I like alcohol because it can be used on most surfaces without streaking and sanitizes the area. 

Set a timer for small tasks. 20 minutes a day everyday will work wonders on how your home looks for general tidiness. 

Pick 1 day once or twice a month to do a deep clean.  Blast some music and really clean all the nooks and crannies once you spend that time getting everything clean you will want to keep it that way."
116,"I had a male supervisor tell me to stop wearing them because ""you could see my underwear and it's absolutely disgusting""

I was wearing them under a flannel dress. You could not see my underwear. He even went on to describe me as wearing a black thong to other coworkers of mine. I was wearing booty shorts to cover my ass, which was under a pair of leggings, which was under a dress. But hey, cool, now we're talking about my underwear at work!

This was at a corporate coffee place! I got written up. He did not. ü§òüèª"

126,"I‚Äôd loved him for a while then, and I could tell he loved me (if laying down next to me for hours while I was puking after a violent hangover isn‚Äôt love than Idk what is, for example), but neither of us had said it yet. I wanted to tell him but my mom‚Äôs a very big believer in ‚Äúlet the guy say it first‚Äù so I waited.

Anyways, when it finally happened, we were laying down next to each other talking about how much we cared about/adored/meant to each other when he asked, ‚Äúdo you love me?‚Äù 

I did. And I told that yes, I did love him. He said it back, and we kept saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù back and forth for about 5 minutes because we were so excited to finally say it lol. 

Hands down one of the best moments of our relationship ‚ù§Ô∏è"
127,"I refer to the need for reassurance as ‚Äúanxiety brain.‚Äù I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship so these obsessive thoughts happen a lot. 

Instead of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to dump me because of the distance, right?‚Äù I say: ‚ÄúAnxiety brain is telling me that you‚Äôll dump me because of the distance.‚Äù
We even refer to ‚Äúanxiety brain‚Äù as a person. He‚Äôs an asshole

It‚Äôs not my fault that I have ptsd and anxiety. So I‚Äôm going to blame that fucker for those dumb thoughts. It also helps that my boyfriend is amazing and considerate."
128,"Internal use of ice, food, lots of oil (sex on a dropcloth, not so fun, but did not want to trash the sheets), sex swings, and slapping anything other than my ass."

135,You‚Äôre the calm to his storm.
136,"Even alluding to the fact that periods exist. 

A few months after we got married my husband and I left a party earlier than we normally would, after maybe 2 drinks.  It had been a long week.

Guy friend:  going home to get it on!

Me: wrong time of the month for that 

Guy friend:  ewww!  Go home, you‚Äôre clearly drunk if you‚Äôre talking like that 


So... you talking about my sexy life is ok, but mentioning my period means I must be drunk?"
137,Please be ok to say no. It‚Äôs ok to say no.
138,Eating something sweet after a meal. Sugar is a terrible addiction and it can take weeks to wean off those cravings.
139,"Oh my god my stepsister wore a camo dress with neon orange sash/belt thing to her prom (or homecoming idk some high school dance). To be fair, she probably wasn‚Äôt the only one wearing that since her school was incredibly redneck. But I still cringe about it. She said she wanted the same dresses for her bridesmaids when the time came. She got married last November and thank god she changed her mind hahaha. They wore hunter green."
140,"Goonies!!!! Just met a bunch of the actors of Goonies last weekend at a comic expo!

EDIT: Also Lost Boys."
141,"This makes me laugh. They don‚Äôt want the no makeup look they want the naturally clear skin and youthful appearance look. 

I have never been a huge make up wearer. But I wear make up almost everyday, just neutral. So when I do put on mascara and dark lipstick people say ‚Äúwow I‚Äôve never seen you with make up before.‚Äù"
142,"Lotion and sunscreen, making sure my hair doesn't look too ridiculous."
143,She was jealous that u looked better probably. Lol
144,"My female friend shaved her head (like, still stubble, just v short) in HS and the principal called her in and told her that she was violating dress code because she was ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù and actually tried to tell her she‚Äôd have to wear a wig. Best part? The principal was BALD!"

152,"Ooh I love this memory. So my husband and I were dating at the time and I used to get off at a bus stop a mile away, and he came and walked me back. While we were talking on the way back he said what I thought was ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù and I asked him what he said and he was like ‚Äúoh nothing.‚Äù So we are sitting at my house and he is telling a joke and we are laughing and talking and as the punch line he says, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù It was so sweet and I love that story. üíï"
153,"One of my friends is in their 40s when they got married. I saw how they struggled mostly because others put that insecurity on them. Nothing is *wrong* with you. I had to tell her that all the time, this isn't an achievement based on character and I'll argue it isn't an achievement to get married, as anyone can do that. It's how fulfilling the actual relationship. We've had friends that sure, they were married but were they happy? No. A few friends aren't even 30 and have had multiple marriages. The quality of the relationship wasn't there but they're so hung up on being one they fall in love with the concept of settling down so they do. Trust me, that isn't better than being alone. I'm divorced once as well and it's because he fucking sucked and we shouldn't have but being alone has taught me to be a better person to be able to have self worth to say no to the wrong thing and how to be a bit better about growing together."
154,Leggings ARE pants!
155,Probably Indiana Jones or Footloose. Maybe Princess Bride
156,"What is a food that you wouldn‚Äôt like if it didn‚Äôt awaken a wave of nostalgia in you? 

It gets people talking about their childhoods, where they grew up, their families, their little family traditions. It‚Äôs a good way to get a glimpse into someone‚Äôs past, someone‚Äôs life."
157,"This is so minor, but I overreacted. 

It was around finals week in the fall semester. My coworker, who I had a massive crush on, was having finals. I sent him a text that said ""good luck on finals! üòä"" I overthought it, telling myself ""you're coming on too strong! Bail!"" I saw him in person later that day and said, ""that text was meant for my friend, not for you."" He laughed and said, ""aw, and I had thought you were being sweet."" 

I wished him luck again during spring finals with no incident"
158,This happened to me! I was wearing a banana republic shell in high school and one of my teachers sent me to the office. I walk in and I told them I was dress coded. They look me up and down and told me I looked adorable and go back to class.
159,Margarine is bullshit.  People who use turf on their property are bullshit.  Having no pockets or poorly designed pockets is bullshit.

163,"People who say their baby is 32-months-old. Yes, and how old in minutes? Let's find out the smallest measurement of time, shall we?"
164,"Same here. I had a date (wasn‚Äôt much of a connection) but he kept asking me what I want to know about him. Honestly, we were both talking equally about ourselves and I felt like neither of us had to ask questions because the conversation just segued into different topics. But he still kept asking me what I wanted to know about him, even though through conversation I found out about his family, favorite movies/shows, his job, favorite pastimes, etc. 

Constantly asking questions just kind of feels like an interview. A flowing conversation feels like a connection."

172,"I had a breast reduction at 22, but before that I was like a 30 J. I used to wear turtlenecks and still get called slut. When I was 16 working at Wendy's my uniform shirt was zipped down to the hollow of the neck, and my douchebag manager Ryan told me to 'zip up' because the customers could see, 'not my cleavage, but the shadow of my cleavage' (????) as I was bending over the hamburger station. When I played soccer I was a good player but kept getting pulled out and or not getting called up and one of the other players told me the coach had made a comment about 'my bouncing boobs'. 

Your principal enrages me. I want to travel back in time and pretend to be your mom just so I can rip him a new one and ask him why he's sexualizing you."

175,"Butt stuff.

Turns out my butt just isn‚Äôt that sensitive. Rimming was boring, anal penetration can be kinda nice (only with small toys) but largely isn‚Äôt worth the effort."

178,"When I was 18 I thought I was being auditioned for modeling in a magazine and the photographer wanted to see how ‚Äúcomfortable I was‚Äù with different poses and wearing little clothing, as it was for a beach gear/bikini magazine.

As the shoot continued on I was being asked to show more and more skin and appear more provocative. I was really uncomfortable, but didn‚Äôt want them to think I was prudish and not hire me. I ended up playing it cool and maybe taking photos that were a bit more inappropriate than professional. 

In hindsight, I know that the photographer was a creepy guy taking photos of young girls and making them think it was legit.  Oldest trick in the book and I fell for it."
179,"People who think hazard lights mean you can park wherever you want, you can fuck right off forever"
180,"Neon coloured mascara comes into fashion for like one week every spring/summer and magazines run articles about how it will brighten up your look in a fun way. NO. I HATE IT. It looks crusty and weird, and there are so many other ways to do creative, fun makeup that are not flaking hot pink spider legs on your eyelashes."
181,"I‚Äôve just come to grips that no one knows how to abbreviate years. Why tf are you putting 96‚Äô? The apostrophe is there to replace the ‚Äú19‚Äù.

Also, it is not 90‚Äôs. It is 90s - plural - not possessive."
182,EXpecially. Why is this so common.
183,That's the wrong kind of doggystyle.
184,"My mother would constantly tell me ‚Äúput a brush through your hair!‚Äù  My texture is similar to what you describe. Obviously that turns me into Simba. I was a sassy teenager, so I did just that. She was unamused."
185,"Not me, but a coworker was supposed to be a bridesmaid for one of her friends back home. She had been telling me about it and was really excited even though she had to fight tooth and nail to get our boss to let her take some days off around the day of the wedding to fly over there. Some weeks before the wedding, she got really ill and ended up losing part of her hearing, which also messed up her balance and made her unable to fly home in time for the wedding. It was all around a very distressing experience, I wouldn't wish it on anyone! When she told her friend she wouldn't make it, she had the most unreasonable reaction ever, guilt-tripped her about not coming to the wedding and about how it was such a big inconvenience that she now had to plan around.... as if she could somehow control the fact that she got ill!"
186,"Prison is dehumanizing. Prison ruins humans. Prison is ""warehousing souls"" as one guy put it. Prison is its ownworld but it is tiny and makes everyone in it tiny. People get out of prison with the ability to survive in prison. Their ability to fend for themselves or care for other people in any concrete way must be rebuilt from the ground up. The process of recovering from prison is not at all supported. Without a significant support system people released from prison will return to it, damaging themselves and others along the way. Prison is horrible."

195,Going out to eat. Growing up we rarely got fast food and my mom always cooked so whenever we went out to eat I was always so excited. Being an adult and earning my own money and realizing I can go out to eat whenever is addicting and I just wish I had the mentality that eating at home is better. Now whenever I‚Äôm hungry my first thought is always ‚Äúwhere should I go eat today‚Äù

205,"My (public) middle school was obsessed with sock stuff, though gym socks were allowed.  In our case, we weren't allowed to wear colorful or patterned socks.  They told is if we got a cut on our foot the dye would bleed into it and poison us.  They never explained why this logic didn't apply anywhere else on our bodies.  It's very bizarre in retrospect."
206,"I don't either. I cannot enjoy oral while I'm trying to give it and I can't give good oral while I'm enjoying it. I can do both things blissfully but not at the same time.

But so many people act like you are deliberately and personally attacking them for it. I don't think dudes with beards are attractive either, I'm not saying anybody has to appreciate my legs (which are rather ugly lol), but I'm not attacking all bearded men as disgusting and unhygenic either."

213,"I'm with you. ""Woulda"" or ""shoulda"" don't bother me at all, because I understand that they're just written out phonetically as in casual speech (like ""gonna""). But ""would of"" or ""should of"" drive me out of my mind! ""Of"" and ""have"" are completely different words, and one is a preposition and the other is a verb, so why the hell are people mixing them up argghhhh!!!!"
214,"I was in a uniform school. During summer I sometimes went with my bike. It's an hour and 15 minute drive one way, so instead of wearing my skirt I wore a pair of pants and took my skirt in my backpack. I arrived at school and got a note for not wearing my uniform on the way to school"
215,"It's hard to stay positive. It's hard to not think that you're going to end up alone and it is hard to think about having to give up that dream of having kids. Everyone always says oh you'll find someone, you'll find someone... okay but what if I don't."

217,"We lost our maid of honour due to a death in her family. Her cousin, which she was very close to, lost her battle with cancer the same week as our wedding. I‚Äôll never forget when she drove over the day it happened. She got out of the truck, barely got two words out and just started bawling. 

She understandably went to the funeral, but she came to the reception afterwards. We were just happy that she had somewhere fun to go to after that and hopefully lift her spirits a bit."

The procedure itself was easy as, recovery was quick. The swelling and shoulder pain were annoying to deal with for the first few days and I had some general weakness and little stabby abdominal pains for a couple of weeks afterwards. Next week will be three years post op and it's been amazing since then."
220,"The series finale of ""How I Met Your Mother"" is complete trash and ruined the entire show."

He didn‚Äôt say it back right then and to be honest I was a little hurt &amp; kinda kicking myself for misreading the situation. 

He whispered it to me in my ear while spooning the next morning when we were waking up. He said he didn‚Äôt want to say it right after sex, because it doesn‚Äôt count due to fuck brain &amp; he wanted me to know he really meant it."

240,"What I found while dating and listening to men share about how all their ex's were ""crazy"" was that it often came down to the fact that it's easier to say a woman is crazy than it is to figure out what she needs. It's easier to say a woman is crazy than it is to listen. It's easier to say a woman  is crazy than it is to compromise or change a negative behavior. It's easier to say a woman is crazy than it is to give her respect. ""Crazy"" is a lazy term. It means you didnt take the time to communicate or to understand their point of view. I dont want to date someone with ""crazy"" ex's because it often means that they wont put in the work necessary for a healthy relationship. 

I'm not saying their aren't legitimately bat-shit crazy woman out there. But most of time a guy would say that all their ex's were crazy, and I dug deeper, I would hear a woman who wanted to spend more quality time together, who was upset because he wouldn't stop talking to the ex he was still in love with, who didn't like how he would pick fights with her in public, who felt that they were being used for sex, etc."

252,"This works really well in my experience! 
I think what's really important to realize is that your absence could've been interpreted different ways. From your own point of view, you've just been dealing with your own problems, perhaps feeling insecure or socially anxious, anything, but overall: *your seclusion didn't have anything to do with them.* I think that's very important to emphasise. 

I had personally secluded myself for quite a bit because of social anxiety and the idea that none of my friends really liked me, but think about the fact that maybe it's also the same for them! Your seclusion could be interpreted by them as lack of interest in them, thus resulting in their distance as well. Simply showing that you do like hanging out with them and being friends by initiating things can help a lot already! :)"

I need someone who's only able to give 30% personality-wise, if that makes sense.

That said, by having my partner contribute 30% personality, they contribute to 50% of the relationship's success. We end up each bringing what the other person needs to the relationship. :)"

Surgery with prep time and waking up time was about 3 hours in the hospital. Anesthesia made me a bit nauseous and I had someone there to drive me home. It was a laparoscopic tubal ligation so there is a little scar on my belly button and one on my lower belly over my hip.

299,"We met when he was in town on summer break from college out of state. I was in no way looking for \[or ready for\] a relationship, especially with someone younger, but he was crazy hot so having a six week summer fling and never seeing him again sounded great!  


Welp, it WAS great. So great that we kept in touch, and he came back to town for a long Halloween weekend and stayed with me. On Halloween we hung out with the mutual friend who introduced us and my guy proceeded to get super drunk off an embarrassingly small number of beers, cried, and told me repeatedly that he loved me and he knew from the moment we met that I was special. Then he passed out and remembered none of it the next day.  


We filled him in on his shenanigans over a Denny's hangover breakfast, and he said he appreciated my having a sense of humor about it and when sober he really wasn't ready for those sort of declarations. He went back to school but continued to stay with me when he was in town. Then there was the second time he told me he loved me: the next summer when we were talking on the phone firming up plans to see each other at the house in ten or fifteen minutes, he ended the conversation with, 'Okay, love you Mom!'  


I of course had to give him all kinds of shit for that too. But that time we were ready to acknowledge that we did love each other, even if I wasn't his mom.

311,"I got mine at 24, and with no kids. Scroll for tl;dr.

I chose a doctor on r/childfree's sidebar list that was close to me. I'd heard that I'd have to try a few doctors, and I needed an OB-GYN anyway, so I chose to try the one closest first after verifying that he had good reviews online.

When I called to schedule with the clinic, I asked the person on the phone if my doctor would do a female sterilization for a woman my age with no kids. I was just blunt about it. She said that he very often did sterilizations for women my age, but it depended heavily on whether he believed it was right for your circumstances -- he wouldn't do it if he thought I would regret it or had doubts.

He did a basic intake and then asked why I wanted sterilized. The first thing I did was specify that I wanted a bilateral salpingectomy (where the fallopian tubes are removed entirely, not just severed) and laid out my reasons why -- because of the lower risk of ectopic pregnancies, a higher success rate, and the promising results it had in studies at lowering the risk of cancer in the reproductive system. He said that he generally did those now, and had moved away from tubal ligations (what we refer to as ""tubes tied."")

Then he asked why I don't want kids.  I pointed out that I just flat out don't want kids. My supporting reasons were that I have genetic health issues that would cause pain for any children I had, that I was at a higher risk for postpartum psychosis/depression/anxiety, that I wouldn't go off my daily prescribed medication to have a kid so I'd have to abort anyway, and that an abortion would be my choice in any circumstance. Finally, I told him I'd rather regret not having kids than regret having kids. He basically shrugged his shoulders and said it sounded like I was sure. I said I was, and he said he'd do the procedure.

I went in for a pre-surgery appointment where he did my first pap smear. He had me scheduled for less than 4 weeks later because of a cancellation. He took my Nexplanon out on the same day as the surgery because it was so deep in my arm that it would have been difficult to do in his office anyway.

I was wheeled back and I don't remember anything until I woke up and had to pee \*really, really\* bad. I was so relieved because they won't let you leave until you pee. They released me a few minutes after I showed them I could walk to the bathroom, pee, and go back to my room on my own.

The recovery was actually incredibly chill. I was working a part-time internship that was three days a week, and my surgery was Tuesday, so I worked Monday, had surgery Tuesday, recovered at home Wednesday, and went back to work for Thursday and Friday. On Wednesday I slept a decent amount and relaxed, no pain really. On Thursday I took a heating pad and blanket to work. I would tuck the heating pad under my waistband when I was crampy and put the blanket over me because I hadn't told my work what I was having done and wanted to avoid questions -- I'm almost irrationally private about not wanting kids.

A lot of women report having shoulder pain from the gas used in laparoscopic surgery, but that didn't happen to me. I was mildly cramping in my abdomen, less than with my already mild period cramps.

Overall, it's so fucking worth it. I had health insurance at the time; I don't now, and I didn't for a long time before, so I knew this was one of my best chances to get the sterilization out of the way before I had to wait for a long time.

\*\*\*tl;dr:\*\*\* Best decision of my life. Got lucky with the first doctor I chose, highly recommend /r/childfree's sidebar list. Be articulate about what you want and why you want it."

321,"Not me but my sister ( I was the MOH so I heard about everything) but she started out with 2 bridesmaids, myself and girl 1. Girl 1 and the best man were married and ended up getting  divorce, so my sister and her fianc√© decided to keep the best man and lost girl 1. 

Then she chose her friend from college, girl 2. But girl 2 was very unenthused at all the dress fittings and basically made it seem like she was doing my sister a favor by being her bridesmaid. Plus, she was not helpful at all with planning the bachelorette party and she didn't like my sister's fianc√©. After a few months of dealing with girl 2, my sister decided they should probably work on their friendship and renew it before she stands next to my sister as she marries her husband. 

Girl 3 is actually another one of my sisters but the two of them have never been close and it caused a lot of drama anyways when my bride sister didn't chose my third sister. To end all the bridesmaid madness, girl 3 about 4 months out from the wedding told everyone she was pregnant with twins. She was simply enormous at the wedding and constantly made every conversation about herself during the day of the wedding, bridal shower, and bachelorette party. Basically my bride sister had the worst bridesmaid luck so I did everything I could image to make her wedding as perfect as I could."

I did my best to calm him down and tell him everything was going to be okay while we waited for emergency services. He lived. I have no idea how I didn't cry or vomit at the time or afterwards."
360,"Oh my God I did not expect this to go that way after such a romantic story. I fear this scenario all the time and could not even fathom the emotions you have, and still experience. I'm so sorry for your deep loss but want to thank you for sharing."
361,I‚Äôve not met someone who I like who also likes me and I‚Äôm not willing to lower my standards or dealbreakers just to be in a relationship.
362,The girls wouldn't. You got ordered to grow it longer. You weren't sent home; you got a talk about the rules and for parents informed.
363,The Amazon position? Ended up bending my husband dick and pulled a hammy
364,"I can add my personal anecdote. My mother had her tubes tied during her c-section with my little brother. Her pregnancy was extremely high risk and he was born prematurely, and her doctors told her that if she got pregnant again and tried to carry the child to full term that she and the baby would most likely die. She was 30 at the time and had only a quarter of an ovary on one side after having ovarian cysts removed when she was in her early twenties.


Five years later she went to the doctor for flu like symptoms and he told her she was pregnant. Of course she assumed he was an idiot and saw a second doctor a few days later who confirmed she was actually pregnant. Needless to say she was not thrilled but she‚Äôs stupid determined and very religious (even though she once admitted that she had an abortion shortly before leaving my biological father because she felt it would be too difficult to leave him if she were pregnant. 


Long story short, my sister was born at full term and healthy. She‚Äôs an amazing human being and I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without her. My mom had her tubes tied again and then shortly after entered early menopause."
365,"And if you're the one performing oral, you get to choose between getting a waterfall of water on your face, or being ice cold if your partner is kind enough to block the water."
366,"Coating his junk in peanut butter and licking it off. Awful, awful idea."
367,"Mannnn I hate to be that girl, but mine is romantic. We were living in the island of Ibiza, where he is from and I was working. We went to a famous look out called Es Vedra to watch the sunset. I had been DYING to tell him that I loved him for practically the whole summer. I told him that I wanted to tell him something, then proceeded to say ""I uh...and started to laugh"" and he completed my sentence by saying ""l....love you?"". And kissed me. So we still do not know who to this day said it first. I had the cojones to start the sentence but he finished it."
368,"I think it‚Äôs fun.

TBH, i don‚Äôt really know *exactly what it is*, but I think it‚Äôs some kind of charity and fashion event for celebrities and rich people.

I just like seeing all the red carpet photos of the fun outfits. Seems like people forget that fashion is supposed to be fun sometimes haha"
369,Does keeping a stash in the center console count? Although I probably have a stash in both.
370,"Just because I'm a woman, that doesn't mean I want or will ever want kids."
371,"Just because I'm not loud doesn't mean I don't have a personality and I need to ""break out of my shell"". There is no shell. This is me and there is nothing wrong with that."
372,It always being someone or something else‚Äôs fault and never theirs
373,"I believe that since sperm want to tunnel into an egg and my eyeball resembles an egg, that they will want to borrow into my eye. Irrational, but that's my fear. So keep it well away from eyes please and thank you."
374,"It really is desperation, especially with the way she has been ""revealing"" things about the sexuality of different characters. As a member of the LGBT+ community, I find it a little insulting that she's pandering to us now, without actually having LGBT representation in her books/movies (at least the original HP series. I haven't seen either of the Fantastic Beasts movies yet)."

376,I‚Äôve been doing this for the past couple years. Made me become so much more comfortable with my natural face. It‚Äôs a great thing to do for yourself
377,"I personally like to do something active on a firtst date, partially because it gives you something to talk about. A bike ride (the surroundings, the weather, food), a not-to-long hike, going to the beach, going to the zoo, or, with bad weather, doing something indoors (climbing, maybe? Glow in the dark midgetgolf? Aquarium?). Potential topics include things I enjoy talking about: Favorite books, series, movies. Hobbies. Weird talents. Pets. Science. Crafts. Questions to get to know each other. What makes you get up in the morning? If you had 1M dollars, what would you do with them?"
378,"Unless your pet is a registered ESA or service animal, it does NOT belong in a grocery store. I don‚Äôt give a fuck if your chihuahua fits in your arms, get that nasty ass thing away from my soon to be purchased food. Ugh"
379,"I'm a girl, but if you ever need a different dad, then god dammit I will slap on a mustache and punch anyone who calls you slut. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that ."
380,"We were friends at the time. We had been friends for a while, and I had developed a pretty big crush on him. We were eating fast food on the way back from a day at the beach. We came on to the topic of love, and it‚Äôs different forms. To explain my point, I told him ‚ÄúI love Mutual Friend A, Mutual Friend B and you, all in different ways‚Äù. He replied with ‚ÄúYeah, I get that, I love Mutual Friend C, Mutual Friend D and you in different ways too‚Äù. Neither of us knew we were making confessions at the time. We started dating months later. 

At least the first ‚ÄúI love you‚Äôs‚Äù were out of the way."
381,"Breast shape, nipple shape/colour, my metabolism was shot and has never recovered, obviously stretch marks, vaginal scarring from birth interventions, foot size, constant back pain, and some change in hair distribution pattern on my body."
382,Lmao! This is one of my biggest fears! Thankfully it was your half sister üòÜ
383,"He says that i seem lonely a lot and is concerned. He's right, i don't really have anyone to talk to, even online. I'm just not the kind of person who makes friends easily- I'm friendly and can hold conversion well enough but i have trouble forming bonds. I've been trying to change that lately to varying degrees of success."
384,That shit blows my mind it was in the 80s. It's still relevant today it's hard to imagine it's been around for ~40 years
385,"I recently went through an emotionally charged breakup.  There was nothing wrong, things were going well, we just weren't in the place for multiple reasons.  We had this nice night together talking about everything and trying to make peace with it, and a few days later I sent him this ridiculous bitter, rude text reeming him out. It was so immature and stupid and unproductive.  The second I sent it I felt like I was being that girl that couldn't take ""no"" for an answer and just wanted to look pathetic and mean.  Months later I apologized profusely and he accepted it, said he totally understands it came from a place of hurt, but i still hate myself for acting like that, especially over text."
386,"Customer service. People are unconscionable *aaaaaasshooooles* to CS staff. Do they not realize that they're screaming at either a student or an elderly person who is already exhausted, stressed, underpaid?


I hope the rest of the world treats these people the way they treat customer service reps/retail workers/servers."
387,"Gremlins. Also, The Neverending Story."
388,When people say reeseees. It‚Äôs reese‚Äôs peanut buttercups
389,"It's GIF as in **gif**t, not GIF as in JIF.  I don't give a fuck what the creator thinks, he's a software engineer, not the arbiter of the English language."
390,We are from Alabama
391,"One sided relationships. The ""friend"" constantly venting and talking about their issues but not listening to yours, or brushing them off as no big deal. I had a friend do this for three years. When I put up a boundary, suddenly I was, ""Ignoring her when she was in real pain."" I listened to and offered advice to her for three years. She hardly ever listened to me, even when I had a breakup and a parent with cancer. A lot of my other friends turned against me because they thought I was the asshole.

Yeah, fuck that. Never again."
392,"My sister (30) went with her husband (30) after the birth of their second child to discuss a vasectomy with their GP. The GP told them ‚Äòwell, I would suggest you don‚Äôt as these days marriages don‚Äôt  always last and it‚Äôs easy for you (my sister) to take the pill. Also, one of your children might die and you‚Äôll want to have another.‚Äô ... 

‚ÄòJohn‚Äô went to a new GP and got a vasectomy."
393,"My mom's whole side of the family is baby-faced, we all look 10-15 years younger than we really are. It leads to some weird situations occasionally.

I was once out at a holiday show or something with my youngest uncle and the nice couple we were sitting with eventually asked how long we'd been together for lol. That was awkward explaining that we're actually related...

My brother and I both get carded regularly when buying alcohol. I'm over 30, he's over 40. Haven't been accused of having a fake ID yet, but a lot of double takes when they see the year.

My entire office at my last job was shocked when they found out I was actually one of the oldest employees there, they all thought I was about 20 and younger than them when I'm actually 5-10 years older. I was never really included in the office culture in large part because of that, but honestly it suited me just fine.

I worked in retail for a long time, it never failed to amuse me when I would explain something to a customer, they wouldn't like my answer and go talk to another employee. Usually whoever looked older and therefore more in charge. Their surprise when said fellow employee would often turn around and ask me the exact question and get the same answer was priceless. Lady I might look 15 but I trained every employee in the store with me, including the assistant manager who outranks my position, but not my experience...

Weirdly enough the number one question I get asked when someone learns my age for the first time is if I'm married. I don't know why it's a thing but it is. I assume if I said yes the next question would be about kids, but since we never get passed the ""no"" to the first question I wouldn't know."
394,"I have two:
1) The Big Bang Theory is a terrible (sexist, racist, ableist) show. It‚Äôs made about smart people, for dumb people. 
2) Veronica Mars was a great show (empowering, clever, well-written) with an appeal to many, that was dismissed by most because the star was a teenage girl."
395,I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. /s
396,"You can grieve however you need to, your pet was party of the family; you may treat the loss as such."
397,"Last weekend a store owner asked if I was still in high school. I'm turning 30 next year, haha."
398,Of course he did *rolls eyes*
399,I'll allow it.
400,"Hey, that used to be prime real estate back in the day!"
401,"I currently have 5 cats and three dogs. Many people have commented that they didn‚Äôt realize I had so many animals until they see them. 
I have asthma, so my house needs to be clean regardless.

- I clean. Every day. Sweeping, washing, dusting, scooping. It‚Äôs easier to spend 10 - 20 minutes a day maintaining the house, than have to spend a few hours a week trying to bring it back. 

- I vacuum all the floors and furniture (that includes moving the furniture) weekly. My floors are all hardwood or tile. Carpets and pets tend not to mix well.

- I have microfibre furniture, so I wipe them down with a damp cloth. Then I use rubbing alcohol in a spritz bottle to get rid of any water stains and potential smells. 

- All the bedding gets washed weekly. (Mine and the dogs‚Äô. Not together, of course.) 

- Any messes or accidents they have is cleaned up using an enzyme cleaner ASAP. 

- The litters are changed and the boxes are washed weekly. The floor gets a wash.

- Once or twice a year, the room containing litter gets a wash down. This includes floors, curtains, doors and walls.

It also helps that I have a big house. The dogs are usually downstairs with me. The cats tend to roam between the first and second floors. Occasionally, they go hang out in the basement."
402,It's good for hands and that's about it. Oral in the shower is just an exercise in making as much saliva as you humanly can as all the saliva you've added to the genital gets whisked away by the water.
403,"Calling women ""females""...it's not incorrect, I know, but it is dehumanising"
404,People - like redditors - assuming that every animal and insect ever is male.
405,My friends used Vicc's Vapor Rub. She had to go to the ER.
406,Cock rings.... it's like unleashing an uncontrollable buzzard on your clit
407,"This is me. I always tell my husband that if he needs me to do something or go somewhere after work, he needs to get me before I put my sweatpants on and sit down. After that, it's anyone's guess on whether I can get up again or not."
408,"&gt;we kept saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù back and forth for about 5 minutes because we were so excited to finally say it lol. 

That is adorable"
409,"Agreed. I hate 68ing. I don't like the view, the fear of a fart slipping out, my nose almost at the butthole and I don't like the idea that my SO can see directly into my poopshoot either. Tis a no from me"
410,"Plans revolving around getting drunk.  
I'm completely okay with everyone having a few drinks when we hang out. But there's a difference between ""let's go camping, I'll bring beer"" and ""I wanna get drunk, let's go hang out wherever booze is cheap""."
411,"Pick someone who understands your illness, loves you unconditionally, and doesn‚Äôt mind.

Work on building secure attachment *with yourself.* This takes practice. Whenever you find yourself feeling something unpleasant, take that opportunity to turn inward and be curious rather than turning outward (whether to your SO or something else, like food, alcohol, TV, etc.) to regulate it forward. Hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to learn how to do, but damn, does it pay dividends."
