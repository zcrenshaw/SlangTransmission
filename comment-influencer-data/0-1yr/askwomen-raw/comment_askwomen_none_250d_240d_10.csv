1,"Same (with relating to Gen Z more). It is weird though because despite feeling like I relate to Gen Z more, I feel nervous about telling my older (93/94) friends about this, they tell I am a ""Millenial in denial"" or lump me in, which kinda bothers me. Have you experienced anything similar?"

Even after my birth, he left and came back to the hospital three times before deciding to sign the birth certificate because he didn‚Äôt want the financial burden.

Lol, well I started crying, my artist laughed and o started laughing so if anything it worked, lol. Plus like you say I hung in there and it was worth it in the end! Did swearing not affect their ability to tattoo you properly?

Hahaha, like I know I want kids, but birth sounds terrifying, but I bet it‚Äôs worth it in the end? Plus billions of women have children so it must be doable!

I feel jealous of your ability to tan! I just get more freckles and then burn...it‚Äôs not the best look, lol. But I think it matches my ginger hair. I‚Äôd look kinda weird with bright green hair, freckles and sun burn, lol. I bet having bright hair takes a lot of upkeep. Did you have to keep having it touched up or use special products to stop it fading and keep it bright?

Like I totally get that guys like what they like. We‚Äôre the same. Having a preference for blondes over brunettes or beards over clean shaved it fine. Making it the defining feature that makes me attractive isn‚Äôt (doesn‚Äôt make me feel special just a faceless object). Especially if it‚Äôs sexualising something that isn‚Äôt inherently sexual. Being told the fact I‚Äôm wearing jeans or have my nails painted (both I‚Äôve been told before) which is getting your motor running really turns me off and isn‚Äôt appealing.

Hehe, yeah we had dinner in a restaurant/bar. I got chatting to him at the bar whilst getting a drink. We had a little dance, the dance got a little bit sexy/steamy. Then I looked up and my parents were sitting at the table staring at me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I made my excuses and left him lol. I wasn‚Äôt about to make out with a random guy in front of my parents, lol."

77,I'm only 26. I'm a driver and cashier at Walmart. Financially I would have been better finishing something with the intention of going back when I figured out what my forever career was. I'm very content and happy with my professional life though. 
78,"No, I meant spot on. I'm not sure how one would confuse two so obviously different app names.

I don't know if it exists for iOS, I like Android better"
79,"I fully trusted him when we started talking and met. I never wanted to start a relationship with trust issues. Then I started noticing him on his phone constantly, asked to look through, didn‚Äôt find anything incriminating but he was talking to other women. I also found he was talking to his ex, nothing inappropriate but in my relationships I feel any conversation with an ex is inappropriate. Asked him to stop and he was continuing behind my back until one day I asked he delete her contact completely and block on social media. He did that, but I didn‚Äôt want to have to ask, if should‚Äôve been done bc he was telling me he loved me already.

I continued trusting him but something felt off. Asked to see his laptop, again nothing, convinced I was wrong and it was my trust issues. Then finally asked to see desktop (feb 2018), and that‚Äôs where it all was. He said nothing is on the computer, basically lying straight to my face instead of just telling me before I searched. Found folders and folders of things. From cam girls he would watch, to a folder all about his ex, to folders of fake fb accounts he made to see porn, nsfw subs, you name it, it was in there. I finally felt like I found what was wrong. 

He had told me porn was an addiction in his past, and it was in mine as well so I understood. He didn‚Äôt tell me it was a present issue. So we both gave it up now, and it has been a struggle but so far it‚Äôs going good. This really broke my trust a lot bc I kept finding things and he wouldn‚Äôt tell me about them ahead of time, which means to this day I wouldn‚Äôt have known if I didn‚Äôt look. I don‚Äôt feel like having to be a snoop, but I feel like in order to know what‚Äôs really going on in his life I would have to be. 

Many months later (nov 2018), I looked again on the desktop, and I found he was looking up friends of his ex, random chicks he thought were hot on social media. Went on his phone and he was looking at models and other women he thought were hot. It‚Äôs not like I expect him to go blind when we‚Äôre in a relationship, I wish ideally he wouldn‚Äôt want to check out other women online or in real life but I know that‚Äôd be impossible to ask bc he has wandering eyes, I just ask him not to stare or be so obvious as he was. I just want him to tell me the truth no matter what I ask. 

Like when I asked him who his favorite porn Star was, he said no idea I don‚Äôt know their names, yet the folders had full names of these camgirls. Or when I asked if he looked at any IG models/nsfw subs, he said no and I found out he did. That definitely doesn‚Äôt help me build trust, that‚Äôs only helping to break it. 

I told him if he wants me to trust him that I need full honesty no matter what, bc he says he lies to not get a negative reaction from me. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt react negatively and he told me he will be honest. We‚Äôll see how that goes. Hopefully he holds to his side of the bargain. "
80,"I was put under to have three wisdom teeth extracted. When I came to I was in some sort of panic. Everything set me off, but I couldn't talk so it was mostly upset screaming/groaning and thrashing. 

Eventually the nurse calmed me down and told me that I had, in fact, been doing this for a good twenty minutes when I was only really aware of about 3 of those. I remember her asking ""why are you screaming?"" very firmly and I was aware enough to wonder that myself, but my body seemed to want to do its own thing. "
81,"When I met my fianc√©, I knew I‚Äôd have to push myself out of my comfort zone and get into a relationship with him and allow myself to fall in love with him and eventually that we‚Äôd get engaged and married. We just got engaged New Year‚Äôs Eve and our plan is to get married in a few months from now."
82,"wow, that's beautiful! I'm surprised I've never read that before, and I love E.E Cummings.

it really does make perfect wedding vows someday. I hope you get to make those soon :)"
83,"Oh man, my first therapist did that! He said that I didn't seem anxious and I was like, ""excuse you? How would you know?"". "
84,I feel people using those terms forgot my name or are disingenuous 
85,"I was assaulted as a child and didn‚Äôt even really recognize what was happening at the time. flash forward to when I was 20, things were heating up and I freaked out when he started going towards my pants. that‚Äôs when I knew how much that time really effected me. I now have a boyfriend that I trust so i‚Äôve gotten better."
86,Me too! I haven‚Äôt bought the body spray but I won‚Äôt bother if it doesn‚Äôt last long :(
87,"I‚Äôd say 10/10

I‚Äôm always up for sex, open to try pretty much anything, there‚Äôs no need to turn me on bc I‚Äôm always on and ready. I wear sexy lingerie outfits for him, new bras and thongs all the time, I go commando, always ask his fantasies and do them. Told him I‚Äôll do whatever he wants, whenever and wherever he wants.

My blowjobs are always really good, usually he‚Äôs pushing me off bc I‚Äôm getting him to cum and he wants to fuck me. They‚Äôre always really wet and fast, plus I can deep throat which is something he‚Äôs never had.

I love anal, and accept it any time he wants or I will initiate it. I love trying all new positions or any position and I‚Äôm very flexible. I love spontaneous sex, on the bathroom sink, in the walk in closet, shower, living room floor, kitchen counter. I‚Äôll do it anywhere. 

I also finish quickly most days, and can finish multiple times in a row, which I know makes him feel good knowing he can do that to me. I also get his cock covered in white juices from me, which we both think is super hot and sometimes it squirts on the sheets. "
88,"Whenever I complain about this, people suggest going to the ""Big and Tall Store""

They don't realize that big and tall is code for ""The Big Store"". They go out but they don't go further down at all."
89,"For specific things, yes. I'd prefer that we didn't share passwords, though."
90,"Absolutely, we know each others passcodes etc., but if he wanted to look out of the blue I would question that."
91,This. Although I would want to know why. We don't really do those things. 
92,Senate staffer. Not fun right now. Though not boring!

After a few months of texting with a guy, I get comfortable enough to go out for a coffee. It's how I met my bf, so it worked well, but the downside is that now I don't have a romantic story to tell about how we've met. :D Also whenever I get asked how we met and I say it was on a dating app, they look at me like I'm a slut or smth, because they say people only use apps for hook-ups. "
137,"That sounds like it would've been a ton of fun, but my memory is iffy when I'm stoned and I would've wanted to remember it (I was about 25 miles outside of the totality and it wasn't anywhere as cool). "
138,"I really like that they're longer, too. Some of my older ones hit right at my pants line, so I can't tuck them in or they ride up horribly."
139,"Of course. We know each other's passcodes and we (sometimes) ask if we can use the other's phone or laptop. We'll give each other a heads up if we've been doing gift shopping though. You know, those Amazon ads that pop up with items you've been looking at recently... :( aside from that, there's nothing else I can think of that I would want to keep private from him. We never go digging into each other's messages because we're open books."
140,Reddit consist only of reposts like this one...
141,What's wrong with that?
142,As far as I‚Äôm concerned the main function of neckties is to give men an excuse to wear something multi-colored on a formal occasion.

145,I just got one from Duluth! I love it (especially since most of mine are about to wear out!)
146,Dignity and self-respect.
147,"Great, so now he‚Äôs my husband :D
I‚Äôm well aware that 9/10 this is not how it works out and usually for good reason but we just instantly clicked, we are so insanely compatible, and we love spending time with each other. We‚Äôve been together almost eight years, living together for three, and married for a year and a half. Being married to each other doesn‚Äôt feel like work. "
148,"Insecure, angry, and he tried very hard to be manipulative/controlling."
149,"I like the fact that I can be more physical with all sorts of people; little old ladies, children, men. If a child falls over, I think nothing of rushing over and picking them up, then brushing them down. I can hug women without it being sexual, I can hug a man without worrying about it.

Also, in other cultures, where men don't mix with women they aren't related to, I can do. So in places like Jordan, or India, I felt a lot freer. You can interact with men as a western woman, but also with women, which has been really nice.

I also think I'm freer in choosing my role in life. I can choose to be a career woman, a stay at home housewife, a person who works part time, or a mixture of role with a lot less judgement than a man would get."
150,Point taken. My judgement comes from our notion of normalcy and sometimes that normalcy isn't right. My bad.

152,"An abusive rapist pedophile. [I finally wrote it all out. It's rather long.](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BladesQueen/comments/adxrha/my_experience_with_abuse_and_rape) But again, TLDR; rape, emotional abuse, and grooming."
153,"People mature at different ages. Some people know they want kids from jump. For others it's more of a ""if the situation's right."" I think it's way better to wait and be sure this is the life you want. Better to err on the side of not having a kid you  want than having a kid you don't."
154,"Depends. I've dated and married guys from family-centric cultures and frankly i'm not interested in family drama at this age.  Like if a guy is like ""yeah my family is gonna hate you"" well i'm not down for the uphill battle i never win like i was in my twenties and it's a dealbreaker, i don't care how in love I am.  

So, if they're from a family-centric culture i'm down if their family is cool; if they're not from a family-centric culture then whatever, it doesn't matter as long as there is no drama. I'm just too old for other people's family drama. My dramatic family members are out of my life."

157,I just had that cheese and it's good. 
158,Thanks for all the input ladies. How often do you wash them? And more info on hang dry vs. dry flat please 
159,Finding clothes sucks!
160,"I‚Äôve been on the pill since high school (I‚Äôm 23 now) and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve gotten into the habit of taking it nightly so it‚Äôs not an inconvenience. It‚Äôs been the only thing to clear my cystic/hormonal acne and made my boobs grow 1-2 cup sizes üòé 

I went off of it for awhile and my acne came right back, boobs shrank, period lasted twice as long and cramps were much more painful!"
161,I loved them! With a bra ubder it almost looked like my boobs weren't far apart and saggy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
162,"My girlfriend got a job at Target and the scheduling was similarly fucked. First they did the training and didnt put any of the new hires on a shift for a week. Then they managed to,schedule her on days she notified them before being hired we would,be out of town for a wedding and scheduled her outside her availability when she had to get her kid from school. "
163,"I have had bad luck too. I had oen I liked, but I moved out of that city. I know you need to fond a good fit but if your health insurance doesn't cover behavioral health (mine barely does) that is an EXPENSIVE endeavor to not even get to the part where you can make progress."
164,"See, and I hate this. I don't mind babies per session, but I have no idea what to do with someone else's baby and am annoyed that they get handed to me over men that actually have experience with babies because of my gender."
165,Lol where are these cool bras for large breasted women?? I miss being able to go get a simple t-shirt bra or one in a colour other than beige or black at the mall for under $50.00.
166,Lay flat to dry. Hanging stretches the straps out 
167,"Lots of variables.


I have been on the pill since I was 17 and it works great for me. One time though a new gyno prescribed me a higher dosage pill than I was used to and it made me sick every morning. Was easily fixed by going back to a smaller doe though.


I was briefly on the shot that last for 3 months and I would not recommend it to anyone. My hair started falling out in huge clumps and didn't stop for 6 months. Was afraid I was going to go bald. I took a ton of Biotin to strengthen my hair and regrow it and after the shot was out of my system my hair went back to normal. Was a rough time though,"
168,"Yep, this is where I get all of mine from"
169,"Either in a gentle cycle in the wash or I hand wash them in the tub. I usually just hang them over the shower curtain to dry. 

I wash them after every few wears, less if I was sweating in them. "
170,I accidentally buy them at target all the time..
171,"There was one crazy case where this woman had a weird blood condition relating to chimerism where she had a different blood type than was possible for her kids and so they took away her first two... then she had a third, the docs watched her give birth, they then tested it right away and it still didn‚Äôt match so they figured out the issue. But it took a while and it was a case where she was being told she was NOT the mother but she was. Not at all common or something women ever really worry about, but I think it‚Äôs a pretty crazy story to think about!  "
172,"Agree! That exceeds the threshold of ""heck"""
173,I always imagined the sound as a dull scraping of boulder over hard desert sand.
174,"Trump supporters, people that are uncomfortable with or don't tolerate drug use, people that are offended by being fact-checked or corrected (I can sometimes be a know-it-all)"
175,I tell you what a man in a kilt is damn sexy!!
176,"I pride myself on getting along with a wide variety of people but being an atheist and feminist...that automatically disqualifies me as good company in the eyes of many. I keep personal beliefs to myself which is probably why I've never really met anybody who admitted to thinking ill of me, but the fact that I identify as both is enough for people to have hangups."
177,"He was the perfect American Dreamboy.  
Blonde hair, Blue eyes, tall, strong, sweet and attentive.  
To this day, he treated me better than any other romantic interest has ever treated me.  
Until he got upset about my plans to go a traditional university after high school, instead of following him around as a military wife. And while angry, he went out and had sex with my long time bully, clearly unprotected, because she ended up pregnant.  
That was a pretty shitty way for such an amazing person to behave, so I chose to cut off all contact after I broke up with him, and I try to remember the wonderful boy he was, before he broke my heart."

179,Earth signs and water signs.

185,"I'm back in school. During my undergrad, I changed my major 4 times, settled on Recreation and Leisure Management, and couldn't find a job that paid enough to make a 4 year degree worth the time and trouble (the most I ever got paid was $13 an hour). I'm currently pursuing Surgical Technology with the intent to move up to Surgical Assistant. Much better life choice. "
186,"Not where I live. Especially colors. Most options consist of white, black, grey, hot pink, light pink and some seasonal colors like pastels for spring/summer and darker colors for fall/winter. I have tried to find a red top I'd like and it's impossible to find one. And I am not really a fan of patterns or at least not the ones they sell. "

188,One day
189,"I was on the pill for eight years, and it worked well for about seven of those.  In my eighth year, my anxiety shot up and my hormonal balance seemed to be off.  I switched to a hormonal IUD and haven‚Äôt looked back since!  Anxiety spike went away and I haven‚Äôt had a period in three years, so can‚Äôt complain.  "
190,"I've been on the pill since high school to 23 years old and it was great. I had shorter periods and they were less painful. I use to have irregular periods where they came three times a month (insert tears). The pills regulated it. 

I am super forgetful though so I switched to the implant. I don't have to do anything and I am protected against pregnancy for 3 years. No side effects yet but I only had one period in the last six months, with the ocassional spoting. That's a win for me ;) 
"
191,"Ignoring the obvious things like belief clashes - lorddddd almighty, women from.. colder (?) cultures often initially loathe me. Hard to describe but restrained cultures where its considered suspicious/vapid/creepy to be smiley and warm. I encounter it a lot with people from Russia and Finland in particular. "
192,That‚Äôs good to know! I remember buying these a lot in Kohl‚Äôs once but stopped seeing them in the store!
193,"Not that much, because everyone I meet is going to be taller than me by default. "
194,The kid gave me his *favorite* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sticker. How does one not swoon?
195,It's a given that you always wear a boxer or something before you pull up that zipper else you can kiss your kids goodbye.
196,I'd work in an orphanage or at an animal shelter. Or in the hospital cuddling the preemies. 
197,It only matters to me if the guy in questions is so insecure about his height that he keeps going on about it.
198,It doesn‚Äôt. I prefer shorter guys and have dated or wanted to date guys from 5‚Äô1 to 6‚Äô2. 
199,"Patricia Wexler regenerating serum. I use it as a moisturizer and it‚Äôs amazing. 

Also I have yet to find a CocoKind product I don‚Äôt like. "
200,"Great, caring, supportive, considerate, smart, thoughtful, funny and so on. He always treats me so well and takes care of me. ü•∞"
201,"When I‚Äôve made a blank profile it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm looking, either for entertainment or curiosity, not With the intent to actually date and I figured that was clear by not putting any information that would make someone want me."
202,"She was sensitive, kind, beautiful, and strong. She was so graceful and moved like a dancer. She wore skirts over bluejeans and made me handmade cards. She loved to kiss me on the cheek and then run away. She knew French and wanted to be an environmentalist. I was fragile and I hurt her, it ended messy. 

He was irreverent and energetic, only an inch taller than me. He liked stupid TV shows and liked even more to brag to me about all the drugs he‚Äôd (supposedly) done. The summer we had together was firey and fleeting, and it‚Äôs relevance to me died with the fall leaves. "

206,"Why's that? I'm what you'd call nerdy but I understand why the subculture gives itself a bad name much of the time, so if that's it, I think quite a few of us would understand."
207,Well let‚Äôs say hypothetically I wake up and am in immediate good health then I think I would probably ask who the president is and what are the biggest things I‚Äôve missed. Real world though I can‚Äôt imagine waking up from such a long coma without some serious recovery that would be at the front of my attention. 
208,Wait - Why would someone message a blank profile?
209,"&gt;  I find that it helps to have someone who is dominating in bed for me.

Why wouldn't giving up control be frightening to someone who was attacked?"

211,Republicans 
212,"A little under three months. I really needed a job, but the people who owned the place were crazy. The lady refused to answer her phone (right on her desk) at all, even when I was on my desk answering the phone she would just sit there yelling at me to come pick up the phone. Her husband would turn off the fridge every day (he would come into the office after hours to do it) so we didn't have cold water to drink for hours in the height of summer. Their son would come into the office after doing whatever sport, dripping in sweat (literally dripping, I had to dry the floor after he left) and start asking me out and/or asking me the same questions every time. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I got injured on my way to work, and not only did she make me stay the whole day, she didn't want me to get treatment (I needed a cast on my ankle) because it would mess with her getting a vacation so she wanted me to 'figure it out' and come in anyway. 

By the time I was supposed to decide whether or not I'd stay, I talked to her and told her I'd stay until she could hire someone else, but that was it. After I checked her records, she had gone through 5 employees for my position in the past year. I wonder why... Oh, I worked for a company that dealt with drop shipping. The work itself was interesting and easy, but the place was dysfunctional."
213,"Trump supporters (I am totally surrounded by them in the South so I get the general impression that most people I know hate me because of this lol), people who do not like/understand sarcasm, shallow/superficial people"
214,"Greatest advice my mother ever gave me was have kids young or be in a position where their college is paid for before you retire. At the time, she was referencing the fact she had friends that waited till their 40s and were going through IVF. They were struggling and had already voiced concerns that they were going to dip into their retirement fund for their next round of treatments. That floored her.

Now, I was about 14 at the time, so we had no idea that I couldn't have kids. That advice stayed in the back of my mind through all the IUIs and IVF. We needed to have a cut off point. Biology decided I wasn't going to give birth. The Army decided we weren't adopting. After 11 years of trying, my husband got snipped to prevent surprises and we have been enjoying life ever since. 

Could we restart the adoption process? Easily. It wouldn't even change our financial situation all that much. At this point, however, we are set in our ways and have gotten used to a childfree lifestyle. Part of me will probably always wonder what might have been, but I will never regret saying enough is enough. "
215,"People trust me. If I'm having trouble opening my bike, convincing the bank I'm not doing anything shady when I got a huge sum of money out of nowhere (for group vacation), or generally am in a situation where people could assume the worst, they tend to assume the best case scenario for me. 

The fact that I'm white, small, blonde and young looking definitely help, but still, I'm more likely to be trusted even if I were the guy version of me. "
216,"&gt; I wouldn't want to date someone shorter than me (I'm 5'9). I don't like feeling ""bigger"" than a guy.

"
217,"Yes this one thousand percent.

The problem is that men are seen as less physically attractive when they get emotions, so they have to hide it."
218,"It's been an advantage when I've needed to break up fights between men. I'm not likely to be perceived as confrontational or a threat being a small woman, so I can tell them to get it together without it escalating things. A male friend of mine was about to get beaten up at a train station. Some drunk guy being a dick and pick a fight, trying to get close to me while he's at it. Pretty firmly told him to walk in the other direction. He looked kind of baffled, called me ""small but scary"" and went on his way. The one time I've had to deal with an actual fight breaking out, I was able to get between them and nudge the instigator out the door pretty quickly, with a fairly good inkling he wouldn't hit me in the process. "
219,"There's nothing wrong with what you're saying here. Many people on the internet wouldn't judge but sometimes forget what it's like walking down the street of an actual city.

You're 100% right that a man will usually get judged for wearing a dress or crop top. (unless it's the 80's)"
220,"Wow! I never liked those. Haha. It was annoying because I‚Äôd always want to wear a real bra underneath and the ‚Äúshelf bra‚Äù would get in the way. Glad that someone got some use out of ‚Äòem though! Have you tried looking at Kohl‚Äôs, JC Penny, or Walmart?"

227,Republicans for sure.  My ex's family were hardcore republicans and took EVERY opportunity to talk shit to me.  I'm at least smart enough to keep politics out of the room when I detect dissenting opinions.  They were chewing my ass out over Obama banning incandescent lightbulbs.  Like I made that...terrific...decision?
228,"I‚Äôm glad to be a woman when it comes to rejection or pick ups. Men get rejected, sometimes frequently and I‚Äôm glad to never have to experience that. I‚Äôm also glad being a woman that I‚Äôm the one being chased by many men compared to men having to do the chasing. I wouldn‚Äôt want to chase, though I think I‚Äôd be damn good at it and smooth AF.

232,"Whoa. I didn't even notice until you pointed it out, but I haven't seen a built-in shelf bra in years. I don't think I miss them since I much prefer the fit of a tank without it."
233,"I can honestly say that my job is so far from being close to my personal life that it isn't hard at all. When I clock out of work, i instantly am done with it. I work at a job that I have very little interest in, but a really fulfilling personal life. I'm not bad at my job, which helps me enjoy it when I am there, but it doesn't effect home at all. "
234,Dancers' supply companies still have them. 
235,Very organized people and people who always need to have everything planned for weeks ahead. 
236,"I'm on the pill (aubra) and it's honestly had little to no side effects for me, aside from like one day every other month where my anxiety sky rockets in the middle of my cycle. But that's down from the weekly bouts of panic attacks before I was on BC, so I can't complain."
237,Everyone tbh
238,Oh my God. I'm still hanging on to ones I got when I was like 13.
239,This was asked a few hours ago

242,Nordstrom‚Äôs sales lady told me to do that when I dropped a lot of $$ on nice Chantelle bras. They lasted 2.5 years + until I lost weight and had to replace them due to fit... were still in great shape!
243,This is literally my life. 
244,"I don't know if you would call it a rape, but my first boyfriend was 21/22 when I was 17/18 and very inexperienced. He was not at all careful with me and would push me into things, threaten to break up because we weren't doing anything, ask me what I would actually do if he just didn't take no for an answer, etc.  At that point he always stopped if I said no, but with constant pressure I definitely did things I wasn't ready for.
Near the end of our relationship he had sex with me once when I was blackout drunk. I remember very little of the whole night. (More beforehand- I fell and hit my head on concrete, and also vomited for around an hour.) It was a very disturbing experience in retrospect. I don't think I realized the gravity of what he did in that moment. 
After this relationship, I started going out with a guy my age. He (my now ex) is honest, caring, trustworthy, and generally just a great person. We started having sex really quickly, mostly because of me seeking it out, and I was always weirded out by how often he'd ask me ""is this okay?"" Or ""do you want to do this?"" Or ""we can stop any time, you say the word"" and just always checking in when things heated up, or during a new sexual act. 
Honestly, in my head, I think the first boyfriend had confused me so much that I thought relationships were 95% about sex, and I thought if a guy wanted to have sex with you, you were basically just supposed to do that. 
I'm a Christian now and I'm trying to wait until marriage for my next time, and I still struggle with just your standard lust, and temptation, but I do feel that my early reaction to the abusive relationship/unconscious rape was not just that. I think I sought out sex to validate my past experiences, make them seem normal to me. Definitely didn't understand how great and sexy it is when a guy checks in and asks for consent. 
So yeah, kind of a reaction to an abusive relationship and assault. I'm still trying to figure out what to call the night when he had sex with me while I was unconscious. I get very uncomfortable calling it a rape and so I usually don't. 
TL;DR After an assault(?) and an abusive relationship ended, I was confused when a partner asked for my consent because I didn't realize that was a part of healthy sexual relationships, and I sought out A LOT of sex to validate my past experiences. "

246,Watching a guy fall off a skateboard and make a scream equivalent to a cat getting mauled. While clenching his nuts. Felt so bad for him.. üò£ 
247,Or slightly too high to where your toes can touch but not your heels.
248,"When I smoked for the first time I took a long hit and I felt as though I was burning a hole through my esophagus like when you do a shot of apple cider vinegar except way slower. I was with a group of people so I said I had to go and went back to sit in my car for like God knows how long  trying not to die while also just spitting up. Then once I was like ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm not going to die‚Äù I went to this place to get two bowls of mac and cheese, a side of steak, and a salted chocolate chip cookie. I‚Äôve never eaten so much at once in my damn life. I slept so good though. The acid reflux the next day was not a good time though. "
249,I have a few pieces of my grandma's Pyrex and they're so much better than the shite produced today. 
250,"Everything cold you eat gives you a brain freeze.

Everything you eat has a curly hair in it.

You have to wear clothes when you sleep that bunch up and twist on your body.

At night, there is a constant intermittent clicking noise that keeps you up.

Loading up a video takes to long, and the moment you become impatient and close the window, it starts playing as you click, missing the video.

Constant single cut in your mouth you can't stop tonguing.

Always bang your pinky toe into corners and tables.

Always bang your elbow in the funny bone on door handles.

Leave the house looking alright, as soon as you leave, unaware booger hanging from your nose."

256,"For me, it's a bit of both. I used to work in construction as a painter and at the time it was often annoying as fuck to be pestered like 4 times everytime I carried a bucket of paint, even though the people asking meant well. I'm very slender, so it's fair and correct to assume that I can't carry as much as my male colleagues, but in a way it became a point of pride for me, to carry stuff myself, if that makes any sense. 

Now that I have a different job (still physical labor, but much less demanding) I will gladly accept the help, if just for the sake of my spine. All of my male colleagues are really nice and not condescending when they ask, so that makes it nicer as well. They will also leave it be if I tell them it's fine (f.e. if I am carrying something that is large, but not as heavy as it looks), which I am glad for. I have no reason to believe that they think less of me for not being able to carry more than half my body weight, that was a worry for me back when I worked construction, even though I am sure that was just my feelings and not the truth. 

Sorry for the long ramble. 

"
257,Welcome to heck! 
258,"Went absolutely wild. 

Looking back on it, I kind of regret it because it makes me feel a little dirty considering I'm in a loving and great, textbook ""normal"" relationship now, but I went home with so many people after that. So many in such a short period of time. 

It was nice to know that not all guys I just met (essentially strangers) aren't total rapist assholes, and would take ""no"" or ""don't touch me"" for an answer if I wanted to stop. "
259,"straight up. cops sometimes stop me when I'm walking... to offer me a ride out of a shady part of town. i wish i could extend that degree of safety and trust to everyone, but in the meantime i try to use to to shield others."
260,This is where I always got them. Thank goodness they still have them. 
261,"True, and thanks."
262,"This. 
Chasing is hard man, and trust me you only get smooth through experience."
263,"As expensive as the bras are, going to the specialty store is one of my favourite shopping experiences. It's like they're trying to make up for all the times I've hunted through departments stores hoping for anything above a DD."
264,This is me. I use the camis for extra support... plus the shelf bra helps keep the cami from riding up every five seconds
265,Weed 
266,"Fine. Progestin BC tends to have fewer/milder effects compared to combination/estrogen BC, so keep that in mind if you're worried. 

I like my implant and don't mind also taking daily pills, so it works well for me. "

268,Get in shape! Good for you all around too. 
269,Great. We've been together 8 years.
270,Oh I hadn‚Äôt seen it. Thanks. 
271,"People who like constant contact. I love hanging out on a weekend or going to a party, but I‚Äôd get exhausted by anyone wanting to text all the time or call. 

I‚Äôm so bad at keeping up with text convos too. I see it while I‚Äôm busy and then forget or put it off and then forget..."
272,Thrift stores? That's where all mine went after I decided I didn't want to wear them anymore
273,"In my case.. one of the biggest dudes seemed to ONLY come after me and not other men (or men his own size). This was like a 6 ft dude against me (a 152, 5'1 woman). Wtf? Why couldn't he pick on a dude his own size in the pit? Luckily, people noticed and they kept picking me up and other dudes pretty much fucked him up for me. üòÇüòÖ"
274,"Try Uniqlo, they still sell those! "
275,"Lol, my DH calls those booby traps. He‚Äôd try to find them and get blocked on the way up. üòÇ"
276,I never had a timeline for in between dating people. I would usually date more than one person at a time so I wouldn‚Äôt even have a breakup period.
277,"If I don't respond to you it's because I've picked a dude for the time being. When I was on tinder I would get tons of messages a day, and I was really picky about swiping. I responded to the ones who interested me the most (via pictures)."
278,"Exactly, they're either a bot, or possibly just don't interact with the app very much/don't want to put any effort into it at all. Is it really surprising when they don't respond??"
279,"You probably aren‚Äôt but you just are thinking too much into it, it‚Äôs not as complicated as you think. "
280,Well said
281,"Get a job, pay my debts, gym to get my body where I want"
282,"Take birth control before, use a condom during, take plan B after if you couldn't do those for some reason. There's no special secret"

284,You described this so beautifully. Lol 
285,[removed]
286,"No, it's not the childcare issues that I'm concerned with when it comes to staying home. For me, it's the long term negative impact on earnings and career trajectory that a long period staying at home can have. It's the risk incurred from being reliant on a single earning partner. It's not wanting to have my identity revolve around motherhood. It's the fact I enjoy working and find it fulfilling."
287,Yep. Most probably would have.
288,Idk I didn't put anything in my bio because I didn't have anything to say.
289,"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how did you get the job?"
290,"Assuming that you are having the kind of sex that can get someone pregnant:

* Before: Use proper birth control in the proper ways.
* During: Maintain proper use of birth control. Don't allow your partner to ejaculate inside you.
* After: Take Plan B or something equivalent if you know or suspect you had an accidental failure of your birth control method."
291,"Also have a larger chest, thanks for the recommendation!"
292,"For me, it‚Äôs probably because I talk a lot at work (teacher) so when my day is over I really crave silence. It aggravates my sister no end when I‚Äôm quiet. "
293,I have a couple from express that I love!
294,I order Hanes from Amazon
295,"I had a real bad time giving birth, just not a fun time. Epidural stopped working, the baby was in a weird position, and I know it's cliche, but it was absolutely the worst pain I've ever experienced. 

At one point, I looked over at my husband and thought, this must be so terrible for him. I'm so glad I don't have to experience watching a loved one in this much pain when there's nothing you can do about it. 

A few minutes more of that and I was like, fuck this, he should feel everything! He did this to me! That was a weird time. "
296,Costco has them.
297,"Oh I guess that would depend on the kind of relationship you have with this person and your own personal limits 

If you communicated well in your opinion and you believe they aren‚Äôt pulling their weight then I would make sure you really sit down with yourself and understand that stuff like that won‚Äôt change if it hasn‚Äôt changed after X amount of months or years 

Me personally I give my SO‚Äôs very few chances in regards to these things , if sexual things are communicated and aren‚Äôt done then we aren‚Äôt compatible. 

But your mileage may vary. "

299,"I mean, if I had the chance of saving my children at the expense of my own life, I'd take it in a heartbeat."
300,I mean if you want to catfish someone you could do that with or without a bio though. Don't think that's the best indicator. 
301,"Pretty much that I eat all day, don't move and basically am a lazy fuck.

I eat once a day and usually stay under 800kcal, work two jobs where I'm basically only running around for 6-10 hours. I admit I don't do much sports except yoga and walking the dog three times a day, but considering my jobs there's not really time nor need for it. Having a hard time losing weight because I fucked up my metabolism with an eating disorder and medication. "
302,"I have literally no answers for you, haha, but I decided to dig and found the book! [Then Comes Marriage](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0380818965), apparently it was part of a series but I didn't read the others. There's also a robotic dog! Ahhhh memories. "
303,"Not unless it was for something necessary. They have their own phone. I have nothing to hide and we have each other‚Äôs passcode if we need it, but we should trust one another enough so that neither of us feels compelled to look through each other‚Äôs phones."
304,"Uniqlo has an awesome line of camis, bras, and underwear that I wear basically every day! It‚Äôs so much more comfortable to wear a cami at work "
305,"Be prepared for crunching sounds when they remove them. You imagine it being a really delicate and fragile process but no, they literally get a pair of pliers in one hand, hold your forehead down with the other, and wrench those things out. I was shocked how brutal it was."
306,[removed]
307,"I'd like to buy a couple, but are they effective in hiding the nipple, both colour and texture? "
308,I‚Äôve been getting mine of amazon because they are so hard to find in stores. 
309,"Not really, which is part of the reason I don't wear them braless. "
310,"Took a lot of time. Partly him complimenting me like crazy, partly just generally gaining more confidence. Early on (before I'd ever had PIV sex)  I used to immediately wrap a blanket around myself afterwards and get dressed under the blanket. This lead to him ripping it off me and turning it into a tickle fight, which eventually distracted me so much that I forgot I was naked, which in turn made me more comfortable with just hanging out naked after sex."
311,"Ugh. I thought it was just me. I just started wearing them, but I knew they existed. When I went to buy a black one I had to search every one in a sea of hundreds to find one with a liner(cause they all look the same). And I just always thought they were more readily available."
312,"I'm kinda childish at times. It means I'm fun to be around and I do a lot of stupid, impulsive stuff that leads to a lot of fun stories and adventures... but I also suffer from mild arrested development, and sometimes I'm still acting like a 16 year old at 27. "
313,"I mean, I'm not that gung ho on pushing sexual ultimatums. I want him to want it. He used to want it. So I want to find the way back to that. "
314,"We dated for 2 weeks, broke up and stayed good friends. 3 years later we got back together, and had many wonderful years together. Unfortunately things didn't last, and after almost 9 years together we got divorced. Still good friends, and if I could do it all over I'd still marry him again. He was always meant to be part of my life, we just weren't meant to be together forever."
315,"My parents were going through a nasty divorce. The divorce dragged on for 5-8years. Started in grade school w the manipulation. I am well out of college and am still being ""manipulated"" by both parents. 

I had a lot of confusion and fear during my teens. Because I was so afraid, I became a compulsive liar at the little things. I was afraid of not being accepted and would lash out before someone else would ""bully"" me. I wasn't angry or sad. I was just afraid and I projected it. 

I still look back and think to myself, ""man.. i was such a bitch."" I cringe and get embarrassed of myself when I think about those days."
316,"Can‚Äôt live without the urban decay primer potion for sure!

Thank you! "
317,"I 100% agree. If I'm putting the money and time towards having a child, then I want to be there as much as I can. Having a kid for someone else to do a large portion of the child raising would make my heart hurt.

They're only a child for such a short time. I wouldn't want to miss it. It's one of the main reasons I'm not sure that I want kids. I don't know if I'm okay sacrificing my career for them."
318,"I was hitchhiking in Humboldt Country and a man picks me up and offers me a vape. I'm not a weed smoker at all, so I assumed that vaping didn't involve weed, so did it with him during the drive. Turned out I was smoking dab the entire time and got absolute messed up. 

I try to keep a very level head when hitchhiking so when I got out of his car and started thumbing for another, it was awful how bad my perceptions were. I got in a car with 4 other men (who turned out to be very nice and caring) but that is absolutely NOT something I would've done whilst sober. It scared me."
319,"I have a Burt‚Äôs bees chapstick on me at all times. Definitely the best.

Never thought about having a dedicated wash cloth for masks ü§î makes so much sense and I never do anything other than sheet masks cause I‚Äôm worried about making a mess! "
320,"Aeropostale still has them, although I have to order them online since I haven't seen them in the store for years. "
321,"I don‚Äôt think anyone should feel obligated to put themselves in danger for anyone, outside of parents protecting children."
322,As a recent bralette convert: yes 
323,Put on a dress and heels. Wear a bra for a day. Shave their entire body below the neck and keep it hair free for a week. Sew all the pockets of their pants shut. 
324,"I broke up with ex and did all the things he said I  couldn't.  

I got a masters-and got good marks in my science classes he said I wouldn't be able to handle! 

 I got another dog.

I started working out regularly again.  

I kept the house clean (which wad impossible with him because he was a slob-who blamed the uncleanliness).

I went through and systematically decluttered my house Marie Kondo style! 

 I of course cut my hair (he didn't like me having short  hair-even though I look rad with short hair! ) 

I got a tattoo,  and a leg sleeve tattoo.  I bought my own house. 

 I traveled A LOT more (this added to my sense of self which I think relates?)"

331,"People think I'm lazy and eat junk. 

Truth is I'm probably more mindful of my health than the average person. I do tabata and strength training throughout the week, as well as walking. I wear a heart rate monitor when I exercise to make sure I'm getting my HR into the upper zones. 

I weigh, measure, and track all my food. I eat at least 5 servings of fruits/veggies everyday. I only eat red meat like once a month *maybe*. I have oatmeal for breakfast. I have a very low sugar intake. I drink plenty of water. I can tell you roughly what my macros are everyday.

My resting HR is low because I exercise regularly. My blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, etc are perfectly normal. I'm not a fat, unhealthy slob. I'm just fat."

335,"He was 6 years older than me, doing his masters degree at college. He was the most boring, uninteresting guy i've ever dated. No wonder he needed to prey on a younger, naive girl to get a partner.

354,"I self soothe with unhealthy food, which always leaves me feeling worse - disappointed in myself, lethargic, bloated, just ugh. Yesterday I was annoyed with a work issue and tried to buy two bags of chips from the vending machine. The second bag of chips got stuck and as I banged my fists on the front and sides of the machine trying to dislodge my chips, I had a momentary realization that this was not a good way to be. 

I also distract myself by shopping, which ends up with me buying things I don't need and may never actually wear. "
355,"I miss naively thinking that his lack of initiative was an easy going, laid back personality trait.  "
356,"I think the issue is seen as women aren't capable of it. Yes, men tend to have more muscles and be stronger, but that doesn't mean women are made of glass. 

It is an unfair advantage in my favor. I appreciate when a guy offers to help carry something but not when it's ripped out of my hands without warning. In general, labor heavy jobs should be for people with the body for it, regardless of sex. Larger frames will naturally be better, but that's not realistic."
357,"I usually try to be as polite as possible, but when I'm pushed to my limits I'm not afraid to get up in their face. A creepy guy at a Vegas club tried to dance with me and all of my friends by putting his hands on our hips(ewwww) and every single one of us politely told him we weren't interested and he wouldn't stop. So then I was the one who turned around and told him to back the fuck up or I would tell security. Then that got the attention of some nicer men around us who then helped get him away from us. I'm polite until I have to be rude haha. "

363,I'm a grown woman who wears bralettes or soft cup/wireless bras. I'm a D-cup but I hate underwires (boob prison) and I also don't care if someone thinks my boobs look like they are sagging. Whatever. They are boobs. Gravity exists. Shit happens. I wanna be comfortable. I know the issue with uncomfortable underwires is that I'm wearing the wrong size but my weight seems to fluctuate every year and I'm sick of constantly having to buy new bras because my size changed.

369,"What I prefer about the camis is there were still straps to hold them up. I suppose some bralettes have straps, but most are not adjustable so I find the same issue, and I can't stand the ones with no straps. They make my boobs look saggy and wind up falling down anyway. Certainly don't feel as secure."
370,"Well, it's an ongoing process. I have had terrible body image pretty much ever since I can remember. AW regulars really tend to fawn over their male SOs, but realistically, Prince Charming isn't going to come and magically melt away all of my deep-seated, lifelong insecurities. Still, it's gradually getting better.

What helped it improve:

* I got to know him as a person and came to trust him over time, both because I consciously made the choice to take that risk, and because he repeatedly demonstrated that he was trustworthy. 
* I became more comfortable with vulnerability and began to challenge my perfectionism, both on an individual basis and through my work with a skilled therapist. 
* I took better care of my body in general and tried to give myself a little more self-love.
* I began to notice and redirect myself when I was ""spectatoring"" during sex (i.e., watching and scrutinizing myself and my body as a voyeur instead of just enjoying the moment). General mindfulness helped with my ability to do this. 
* I moved away from viewing sex as a performance or some kind of favor I was doing for someone else to make them like me, and toward viewing it as a way to deeply and intimately connect with someone I loved, which was equally beneficial for both of us. 
* My SO always touched, treated, and talked about my body with nothing less than the utmost respect.
* Honestly, he complimented me a lot, which wasn't the make-or-break but certainly didn't hurt. "
371,I don‚Äôt see what having a great parent has to do with having feminine hygiene products? I could‚Äôve gotten them from a school nurse or teacher... or even a counselor? It has nothing to do with my parents. You also don‚Äôt know if I have ‚Äúgreat‚Äù parents either. 
372,"I think of childcare costs were more affordable that I‚Äôd feel more like I had to work full time. 

As it is, I work part time now and would probably lose money if I had anything less than the ‚Äúideal‚Äù full time hours (‚Äúideal‚Äù I‚Äôd break even or so). 

 I love being a part-time ‚Äúat-home‚Äù mom. It has its challenges but honestly, I love it. It‚Äôs not for everyone and neither is better than the other. I was not working it all when my son was an infant but plan to take only a few weeks off when this baby is born and get back into freelancing - and a big longer for my ‚Äúoffice‚Äù job (it‚Äôs casual, we will work it out). But I‚Äôd love to be a SAHM until both my kids are in kindergarten.... but I do like my current job."
373,"YES. To sort of add to what you said, just overall people thinking that we‚Äôre overeating for the hell of it. I‚Äôm sure some people do but I feel like many fat people find comfort in food and it‚Äôs their way of regulating their emotions. I say it all the time. While alcoholism is demonized, people at least view it as a problem that needs to be fixed. While overeating is seen as lazy and disgusting, it‚Äôs a meme and so funny, people just tell you ‚Äúrun, fatty.‚Äù and they don‚Äôt care. Food is great in general but I would be lying to you if I said I was a foodie. I‚Äôm just depressed and feeling stuffed and in the verge of busting calms me down. "
374,"oh! well then just ask her haha. Never assume someone wants to be exclusive without first having that conversation. That just leads to heartache. When in doubt, talk it out. "
375,"Basically just realizing I love my body and if he didn‚Äôt then he doesn‚Äôt get it. And boy, when he wants you that bad and you can‚Äôt help but feel like the sexiest thing in the world.

Still mad at Dunkirk for putting a mask over that gorgeous face for most of his screen time. Oh well, at least I still got to hear his voice. I swear that man...it shouldn't be allowed to have someone be that sexy and talented and he loves dogs, I mean it's just fucking rude at some point"

"
380,Probably for the same reason men do: they are shitty people
381,"Right! I feel like in a career or hobby setting you can consistantly set concrete goals that provide concrete results and it is satisfying, and when you get out and do something for yourself you get that emotional release, but raising little humans is more difficult because your goals are muddied and abstracted by a biological being whose inner workings you can only vaguely guess at and it is hard to get concrete results without risking hurting your kids' psyche... so it is much harder to get a sense of getting things done with a kid because it is hard to quantify productivity with a child and productivity isn't necessarily even the point maybe? 

Sorry, I was just kind of walking through my thoughts"
382,I will be back. 
383,I searched everywhere to find a workout tank with shelf bra. I have one I got years ago and love it. I could not find them anywhere! I went to about 4 stores too. The only thing I could find is a sports bra and tank built into one which isn‚Äôt the same thing. I feel your pain!

385,"Dress codes in casual offices. In the summer, I can show off my legs, arms, toes, feet, etc, via dresses, skirts, sleeveless tops, sandals. But the men still have to wear pants and at least short sleeve tops and actual shoes and socks. In the winter, I can get away with wearing stuff that feels like pajamas (leggings, large cozy tunic tops, etc) and the men still have to wear actual pants and probably button down shirts or polos under their sweaters.

387,"Fellow English major, aiming toward project management!  I'm at a nonprofit right now, so I can't expect that kind of money staying here, but it could get me the experience and title.   When I was younger, there was a prevailing ethos that your 20s were the time to work hard for little salary, but I've recently realized I can't keep treading water forever in my pay.  We're not sure we want kids, but it's pretty depressing that we don't even have to consider it right now because no way could we afford it without selling our house."

390,"By now I'd say he is about 98% in, but he's been out for a while. When we first got together (about 7 months after his first deployment) I would say he was about 60% there but immediately volunteered to go back when they asked. He got home in June of 2012 from his second deployment, we got an apartment and got engaged- I think he was worried he would be a mess like he was (apparently) when he got home the first time, but the second time around his situation with family and friends completely changed, so he came home to a much easier place with a lot less pressure. "
391,"I found a couple Aerie shelf bra camis in goodwill a few weeks ago, but not sure how old they were. I wasn‚Äôt impressed with them though lol, the hem/strap material was way too tight compared to the tank material and it squeezed my boobs and armpits very uncomfortably so just beware :) "
392,"I think it only works when one or the other of you doesn't care very much. 

That said, I think two people of *similar* beliefs could make it work- say two different versions of Judeo-Christian beliefs, because you agree on some basics.

I, personally, could not be with someone without a similar religious view as mine. I am atheist-- I could handle someone more agnostic or with a vague ""spiritual"" belief (we are all one, connectedness of the universe, etc- things I find plausible or at least interesting). Someone fully dedicated to a religion? It just wouldn't fit with my outlook or lifestyle. I have friends of many different religious backgrounds, but it is not the same when you are choosing a partner to share in your life with you. "
393,You're not going to get any honest answers to this. 
394,Shopping and brooding and sleeping are my go-to's.
395,My SO does a lot of audio/sound work so text messages and alerts could really be a detriment to his ability to focus on work. I‚Äôd be super understanding if he chose to mute anyone.
396,"My sister does this to her husband.

She‚Äôs just always been that way...to everyone. She was angry and critical growing up, continued to be angry and critical through college, was angry and critical while they dated, and continues to be herself now that they‚Äôre married. (Surprise!)

Honestly, my aunt and I have wondered about it together, but he had to have known what he was getting into, still proposed, and seems happy. So I guess it‚Äôs none of my business. "
397,Relatable
398,"Hell to the no. I need the intellectual stimulation that would ideally come from working full time to me to be happy. But that also means that if I was making enough money, I would potentially be fine with supporting a partner who wanted to do it. "
399,"I'd ask why - chances are it was an accident. He'd tell me if he wanted me to text him less often (and I'd understand because he has one of those jobs where they can't be on their phone a lot).

I think the bigger question is how did your coworker find this out? Did he tell her he muted her or did she snoop? Because snooping IMO is worse."
400,I used to feel super insecure in the weight room just because there's typically more guys in there and I wasn't completely comfortable with doing weights. I just tried to educate myself on exercises to do. The more time I spent in the weight room the less I cared that I was the only girl. Just takes time and practice. 
401,"Turkey with the works

402,I have soooo many choices when it comes to dressing up! Yeah it can be confusing to understand varying dress codes - but it's so nice to have OPTIONS.

408,"People who are uncomfortable talking about politics, sex, drugs, alcohol, religion, mental health, etc. I am pretty open about that sort of things and I have made the mistake of assuming that strangers are also okay with weed jokes or jesus jokes.

410,I focused specifically on my goals. And the only people I compared myself to were the senior folks. When I saw a senior person lifting more weights or running for miles and miles on end... They inspired me to push myself.  
411,"When I‚Äôm running the track and groups of elderly men pass me saying, ‚ÄúOn your left!‚Äù"
412,"If you're going to the gym 5 days a week, exercising in-between and still overweight, you're eating too much still. It's not laziness, it's just excess consumption. "
413,Fuck that noise. I get mouth sores all the time and over the holidays it was so bad that just trying to brush my teeth would leave me in tears. 
414,"She said that she noticed that he would get sound notifications but anytime she sends him something, there's no sound notification. But they use each other's phones interchangeably so she never really has to snoop. "
415,I have everyone muted. My phone is always on mute unless I'm expecting a call. I just check my phone when I'm available. So I wouldn't be offended since I already do it.
416,"Right, I mostly just message my s/o to send random articles or memes. But most of our conversations are face to face"

420,"I was with a friend who had some weed pills and he talked me into taking one. At first it was fun, I got to the point where everything was hilarious and I felt heavy and I was having fun. A little while later, the paranoia set in. I had to drive home and my sister was in the car with me and she had to coax me into just pulling into the driveway (my friend drove us both home and dropped us off one house over, I was in no condition to drive.) Apparently, in the car I was continuously picking up my phone and looking at it every two seconds and at one point I screamed because I realized what I was doing. When I got home, I climbed into bed and tried to sleep it off and I ended up calling my friend and freaking out, completely convinced that I was never coming down and I was going to die."
421,"Of course! Privacy is important and healthy, and you and your partner are each entitled to it."
422,"Marks Work Wearhouse sells a version of them, the ones I‚Äôve seen all had padding but that‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve found in Canada in a long time"
423,I don't see why I would react at all.
424,[removed]
425,That she was busy and couldn't be distracted.  And then forgot to unmute.
426,Try Express. Former employee. They sell bra camis all the time. Usually decent pricing and made of great quality. Around this time of year they‚Äôre having their semi-annual sale where a bunch of stuff goes on clearance. 
427,"Leave work at work. When I'm working from home, I work from my desk - not my couch, even though it's tempting. 

Go to the movies in my PJs on Friday nights.

Yoga videos."
428,"Be mean. Being nice doesn't work on pushy guys. Get the bouncer involved too. They're there to make sure you aren't being harassed by these jerks.

Also second getting loud. They don't like attention drawn to them so it'll make em disappear quickly."
429,"Four weeks. I got a job as a barista in a coffee shop inside a larger store. They did not adequately train me. Two weeks in, I got the opportunity to go on an expenses-paid (like, all I would need is money for a few lunches and souvenirs) trip to a country I'd dreamed of visiting. They would not give me the time off (it was enough notice but ""that's a busy time of year for us"") so I quit."
430,Fantastic taste on both counts. 
431,"No they don't. 

They just take measures to hide the fact they're women so they won't get harassed. As for me I don't talk over voice chat, ever, because I know the harassment would ruin a game for me.

Even when I don't talk the casual sexism and racism sometimes ruins a match for me but I just take a break and play again later."
432,Look up night time nursing bras. I've never been so comfy sleeping.
433,"I've learned to change how I think about seemingly every day things.  I tend to think of everyone as male in my head, so naturally I assume everything is as easy as it is for me "

457,"If it was all the time I'd be annoyed, but if he had done it while he was at work or really busy, then that's cool."
458,Only if it's too big or too small. I prefer a good old average penis. 
459,People are not ever really intimidated by women (much) so I can be me in whatever form and people will still take the opportunity to get to know me instead of feeling threatened right from the get go before introductions because of a penis.  
460,"I'd ask him why.  Who knows, maybe he was waiting for an important client call and didn't want extra notifications."
461,"Victoria Secret, actually. I shop online in their clearance section. I know there's some backlash about their CEO right now, but I hate going into stores to try on a bra and I know my size with the VS styles. The one I have is not sexy - it's nude coloured and plain fabric, but I didn't buy it for the appeal. I believe it's actually called a ""underwire bra without padding"" in their description, so they don't even really call it a bralette, but to me, it's a perfect hybrid between a bralette and a fully padded bra."
462,This.
463,Uniqlo has some great options. 
464,"Yes, of the three times I‚Äôve told someone. It went well, they were relieved I said it first. Too soon imo is before you had to struggle with that person and had to work through things together. I prefer to see all sides.  "
465,"I've only dated Americans.  Well, and one Canadian who was was so polite, he was passive aggressive and cold."
466,"I thought I told someone I loved them first, apparently they told me a week before without me realizing it...I sorta felt like an asshole.  Relationship wasn't successful but those feelings were there at that time.  People change and I was young."
467,"I told a current partner that I loved him while we were both on molly. He told me we should talk about it when the drugs wore off. That was 5 months in. In my defense I'd been thinking about saying it, but my not sober brain felt that it was VERY URGENT to say it right then.

&amp;#x200B;

(The drugs wore off, he asked if I remembered the conversation, then he told me he loved me. We're at 8  months now, and things still seem to be going strong)

&amp;#x200B;

I've said it in previous relationships a LOT faster (like as soon as 2 weeks). Those relationships weren't healthy. "

Everyone thinks, but everyone doesn't talk about thinking . It's a boring conversation piece. Which is why they havent ""shared"" with you....."
471,"I have said it first several times, and I've meant it every time. I don't think it's possible to say it too soon, but the key is to be sure with yourself that it's true and to not expect immediate reciprocation.

I told my husband that I loved him before we were even properly a couple (we'd known each other for a long time, though), but I told him that I didn't want a reaction or him to say anything back, I just wanted to share my feelings. I don't think he reciprocated for several months, but it was important for me to know up front if he was serious enough about me to handle how strongly I felt because I was about to move cities to be with him. He basically said ""I'm not there yet, but I can see myself getting there"", and that was all I needed to be sure. That was more than 8 years ago, and it worked out."

474,"Yeah, especially in games primarily played by teenagers and young kids. Gf is a healer/support main, and she gets discouraged by more toxic players of she tries something different and doesn't do good. We report them and a good chunk of the time those players do get banned or punished in some way, fortunately. "
475,"Well I've only ever resigned once, so it's not as short as some of you. 

I worked at a bakery inside the airport for a little over a year. I started there because they were the first place who did from scratch to hire me, and I needed to be somewhere that did that for externship requirements after baking school. (I had been somewhere before, but they closed, leaving me to find something else)

I had to stay at least twelve weeks in order to complete the externship and paperwork. I stayed longer than that, but eventually the strain of having to get to work (park at the ass end of the airport, ride a bus to the terminal, go through security), several people having shorter stays resulting in too much work on my end, and the feeling of being disliked by some co-workers I found another job and put in a notice."
476,I‚Äôve spotted a few at Costco randomly. Love them for the same: lounging. 
477,"Speaking only to the actual question and not to some random situation I don't know anything about: 

They should do what feels right to them, but barring immediate emergency intervention situations, it is a lot better to call the authorities instead."

Would you feel insecure about you small sized D? 
Grow the hell up. "
479,"But I feel like we grow out of it, for the most part(there will always be stupid women who think  you have to keep your legs shaved). I remember being a teenager and judging other girls on their bikini line at the beach. Now I‚Äôm just a few years older and I realize that was bullshit. I would never judge anyone now on their hygiene habits(unless they‚Äôre just not showering, take a shower you dirty hippie). I know I would never judge a woman now on if she was wearing makeup or if her legs were shaved. 

Be free, sisters. Do what makes you comfy. "
480,"Like a wider variety of body types and frames? And I do enjoy that feature in most RPGs, playing dress up in the games is always enjoyable, playing as either a male or female character. "

486,I‚Äôve always said it first in all my relationships and it‚Äôs always led to problems bc I tend to say it earlier than most people are comfortable with. Now I just don‚Äôt say it at all even if I feel that way.
487,"I had to order mine online. But I know exactly what you mean! I have tig ol‚Äô bitties and walking around without a bra is uncomfortable, but wearing one all day is even more uncomfortable and the tank tops with the built in bras are perfect. They provide just enough support and they‚Äôre comfortable! "
488,"I always hear British men are more reserved and standoffish in relationships, whereas American men are more outgoing and skip the formalities of courtship."
489,"My boyfriend suggests Crunchy_Sleepy_Bitey for my cat. He's got a particular toy that's crinkly and he loves paper to crunch and crinkle, sleeps a lot, and also tends to bite. That last one was a struggle to teach him how to play without hurting and not to sneak attack legs at full bite force. "
490,Try out an app called Flo
491,"Not any one thing in-particular, but it's a great reminder that there's a lot of little things to be learned from listening to people with a different background than you. There often interesting or useful tidbits to pick up on here. This sub, along with ones like /r/askhistorians and /r/askeconomics, is among my favorites when I want to browse for a bit and learn something new."
492,My dumb lady brain wasn't wired for thinking :(
493,"&gt; As I stated, different ~~people~~ women operate in different ways. Some ~~people~~ women are more athletic, more inclined to it, and some ~~people~~ women are more inclined to other things. I view no activity as more important than other. But it isn't a lie that some ~~people~~ women enjoy thinking more than other, just like some ~~people~~ women might enjoy sex more than other, or food, or doing sports, or so on.


There you go. This is only a question you would find mysterious or confusing if you assumed ""women"" are any different from ""people""
"
494,"Keep learning, because I'm living the shit out of mine right now."
495,"I used the word females since I first classified myself as male, and I did both in order to evoke the idea that I asked the question from a biological point of view, not a mystical one.
