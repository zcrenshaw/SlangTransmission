0,"Wearing the same outfit to a number of formal events in a row without anyone noticing/commenting.

Me and my ex went to three weddings in one summer a couple of years ago. He wore the exact same suit/shirt/tie to all of them...no one said anything. I wore the same dress twice (I wasn‚Äôt spending money on 3 dresses!) and a couple of people not only noticed, but made comments about it."
1,It is not uncommon to rip a big fart in the men's room. My wife tells me this would be a serious breach of etiquette for women. I don't get it. If you are not allowed to fart in a bathroom where the hell are you supposed to do it?
2,Taking your shirt off in public. 
3,"‚ÄûOh she‚Äôs wearing makeup she must be so insecure!‚Äú

*not wearing makeup* ‚ÄûAre you sick?‚Äú"
4,"Missed opportunity, should have called it a fucket list. "
5,"Suggesting that because of my skincare routine I'm high maintenance. I am, for myself, but not for others. I'm super chill in my relationships, I just spend a lot of time taking care of my skin cause I'm 32. The opposite is the 'oh she let herself go' bs, or ""she wears too much makeup""....so it's pretty lose/lose once you can no longer rely on your youth to be 'presentable"". "
6,"I want a day where my partner and I spend entirely naked. Just, we hang around the apartment naked, watching TV or playing games. Plenty of friendly cuddling. And having spontaneous sex several times. But all my partners so far don't really like to just hang out naked. If we're not having sex, they want to be clothed...

I'm no nudist, but I've always wanted to try it."
7,"In kindergarten I had this outfit that included a vest. I loved wearing it because I could take the vest off and pretend to iron it on the fake ironing board in the classroom. 
That's what I would call mundane. "
8,[removed]
9,"Joking in a mean/funny way with one another. My male colleagues joke all the time calling each other fat, short, weak, etc... If I said something like that to another woman I think she would be shocked and hurt."
10,You do it but don't leave the stall. 
11,"I hate how women are criticised for enjoying things that happen to be popular with other women. Pumpkin spice lattes, for instance. People act like any woman who drinks them must be some vapid drain on society, when it's literally just a sugary beverage, and the only reason they get criticism is because they're considered a ""girl"" drink. Let women enjoy things! "
12,When people say a childless (by circumstance or choice) woman is a waste of womanhood. We're all worthy women whether we procreate or not.
13,A heavy object needing to be moved from one place to another and everyone just standing around looking at you like some kind of idiot until you do it for them.
14,"Going to a hotel for sex for an entire weekend. Not leaving the room just order room service before going at it again, 

Edit: thank you Reddit for making my top karma comment about sex. As only it should be "
15,"I‚Äôm sure we have all heard this before

If I dress ‚Äúdown‚Äù I‚Äôm tired, lazy, not ‚Äúput together, etc. 

If I put on makeup and ‚Äúdress up.‚Äù I have a special occasion. 

No I do this randomly depending how I feel. 

I feel like everywhere you turn it‚Äôs some comment about something. "
16,"I did this with a coworker once a long while back. We both ripped one. Neither one of us wanted to leave first. I was like, ""I'll leave first."" She was like, ""OK."" 

She knows my voice, I know her voice, we both know what happened, but what happens in the bathroom stays in the bathroom.

"
17,"Told him I had cancer. He reassured me everything would be okay and that we would get through this. 

The next day, I came home from work to find all of his belongings gone from our place. He‚Äôd changed his mobile number and blocked me on all forms of social media that we‚Äôd been connected on. 

We were together for five years. 

I beat the cancer and found someone new, but I will never forget that... 

*Edit* You guys are incredibly kind, and it did work out...I would never have met my current partner in crime had my ex not done what he did. It‚Äôs not okay, but it set me on the right path eventually. üëçüèª  "
18,A 20 year mining ban has been put in place around Yellowstone Park 
19,"Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.

Michael: Because... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.

Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.

Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not."
20,Getting picked up and fucked against a wall. One of my many motivations for wanting to lose a ton of weight. 
21,"There's so much criticism around how women spend their money! Anything that involves clothing, makeup or physical appearance is deemed as shallow and frivolous, ignoring the ways women get criticised for not doing those things. 

It intersects with enjoying things that are also popular with other women - it's not acceptable to spend X amount a day on lattes (or to get your nails done regularly,) but it's okay to drop a few hundred dollars for a sporting event that's widely televised and easily accessible? One of those things is seen as frivolous and a poor financial decision and the other is just accepted. "
22,I was just thinking this about Prince Harry an Meghan Markle! I keep reading comments about how she wears the same ‚Äúthing‚Äù over and over again. I‚Äôm pretty sure Harry wears the same blue suit (not literally but they all look the same) to events??? No one says anything about him. But there‚Äôs such a focus on what Meghan wears. Like if someone has a style that suits them then of course they‚Äôll stick to it! 
23,i long to be free
24,"Walking around in public with visible leg or armpit hair.

I wish the stigma wasn‚Äôt so strong, but whenever I see an article trying to celebrate a woman for bucking the pressure to shave, 99.99% of the comments are about how ‚Äúgross‚Äù and ‚Äúnasty‚Äù she is for daring to wear a tank top without shaving her pits."
25,Sex with a girl. I‚Äôve always wondered... 
26,"I just try to remind myself that the presence of their beauty/wit/intelligence/skill etc is not the absence of my own. I think I read that on Instagram of all places, but for some reason it helps me feel better."
27,Having the sex
28,"Well, there *are* lesbian bars/clubs although men can still go to them, but in my (limited) experience there were no men in the ones I've been to. But beyond that, I doubt there's much of a market and it also may be illegal. "
29,"You can do it in the bathroom stall, but only if you're the only person in the entire bathroom, or, if you hide in shame in your stall until everyone who heard you had left the bathroom."
30,"On a balcony? For some reason, that just seems hot to me"
31,It‚Äôs so ironic because when my self esteem was at its lowest I wouldn‚Äôt bother with makeup because I thought it would be like putting lipstick on a pig.
32,"Idk if anyone's mentioned camping.
I know many women enjoy camping, including me, and I think this example is bs. But every time I go alone, or with another female (both of us under 30), someone inevitably voices concern, or pleasant surprise, or our ""bravery"" or ""outdoorsy-ness"" and wonders if I need help pitching my tent. Sometimes it's common neighborly (camperly?) good will, but often it's due to simply assuming we're less capable, or not naturally suited to it, or wondering why the terrors of the world don't keep us from being independent sans male escort."
33,"The stereotype that women are nurturing. I‚Äôm pursuing the title of physician and I just want one week to go by without someone asking me if I would be happier as a nurse.

Believe it or not, each woman is actually a human being. With separate personalities, interests, and goals! Just like regular people wow"
34,"Jokes about sleeping with your friend‚Äôs parents. I always noticed my male friends joking about nailing so-and-so‚Äôs mom but if my female friends ever made a crack about sexing someone‚Äôs dad (or mom for that matter), I‚Äôd be immediately horrified. "
35,Urinals...extra special for the communal trough urinal  
36,"Eating out alone. Women are expected to be so collective and fearful, that many of my friends wouldn't dare go to a restaurant alone, and I get weird looks when I do. 

I bring this up because just today, I forgot to pack my lunch for work and I was craving Chinese food. Went over to the local Chinese place and asked for a table for one. Immediately the Chinese man says ""You're eating alone?!!! So independent! That's good."" Like, what do I say to that? ""Thanks pal, I'm trying to eat lunch like every other regular human."" There were tons of men eating alone on their lunch break, same as me, but no one makes awkward ass comments to them. 

Another time I was studying for finals. Went to the local Mexican restaurant alone so I could hide out in a booth with my textbook and some chips and salsa. The entire waitstaff starting talking about  me in Spanish, not knowing that I understood. They were like ""Doesn't she have a man??? How weird, who does she think she is?""

Then there's the issue of guys thinking that because you're out alone, you're looking to pick up a date. No. I try to bring a book with me usually to clue everyone in that I'm just there to eat and read in peace. Nope. Immediately getting hit on. Should I sit at the bar? Men would interpret that as me being thirsty. Should I get a table for one? Get weird looks from waitstaff and judgmental moms with families. Waitstaff gets mad I'm using up a table for just myself. Can't win, because single women are supposed to never go out, sit at home and be terrified of judgement or rape. "
37,"The concept of ""trying too hard"".

Listen, if I want to get dressed up it's because I freakin' feel like it. It's not always for you / about you, and it doesn't make a person stuck-up. Life can be monotonous and stressful, sometimes getting ready for it is the most you can control. I was once asked ""why I dress so nice / formal"" sometimes and honestly, my answer is ""*because it's fun and it's how I like to dress sometimes*"". I'm not trying to seem self-important or get attention, I'm not walking through downtown alleys at night in a ballgown, but a crisp or creative external expression makes things interesting and helps me feel put-together in more than one sense. Plus you really shouldn't assume a person's income by their dress."
38,I want to have a discreet remote controlled vibrator in my underwear in public and I want my boyfriend to control the remote. I haven‚Äôt brought it up to him because We‚Äôve only been together 5 months and idk if he‚Äôll think it‚Äôs weird or hot lol. 
39,"When I was about 9 I was standing in my aunts house and I thought to myself ""I'm gonna make myself remember this"".

16 years later I still remember."
40,"The idea that a period is just an excuse to get out if doing work. Like listen buddy I can't stand up straight without immediately doubling over, I think that's a good enough excuse. "
41,"I hate being judged for liking things such as video games or comics casually. So often men (and sometimes other women) see me wearing a shirt with a character on it or hear me mention something in normal conversation, and I am instantly met with a game of 20 questions about the topic to prove I'm not just pretending to like the franchise to seem more appealing to the male gaze as a ""fake gamer girl"" or whatever. I truly do not understand why others think women need their approval just to have an interest in things they find enjoyable. Do they REALLY think I went out and spent hundreds of dollars on a gaming console just because I thought it would make me more attractive to others? Would I seriously waste that much of my money and time on things I don't actually care about purely for men's attention? I can't help but wonder if they even realize what they're accusing me of, or if it's just been so normalized that they never took the time to think about what they're actually saying."
42,My wife and I did this for one night and after that I don't know that I could handle a whole weekend.  Things were pretty raw for both of us by that point.
43,"Excessive criticism of pop culture marketed toward women versus that which is marketed toward men. 

The stereotype of the ""mean girl."""
44,"I can attest that it's wonderful

10/10 would recommend

**EDIT:** The one exception being an apron for cooking. "
45,"Oh man as a woman I‚Äôm on the other side of that annoyance. Quickest way to get me to lift something is to tell me to let the guys do it. 

I get frustrated where people will say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt lift it let someone else‚Äù like they know my capabilities better than me and won‚Äôt let me test it myself. 

90 percent of the time I can lift it. I‚Äôll be damned before I stop trying to help. "
46,It's fucking in tents.
47,"We were at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. My dad took me on the big horse carousel. There were these little silver rings you could collect on each rotation, and you were supposed to then try to throw them into this clown‚Äôs mouth that was painted on the wall. 

My dad collected a bunch for me and handed them over so I could have the joy of throwing them into the clown‚Äôs mouth. 

The problem was that I was too young to understand this, so I waited until the ride was over and dropped them onto the ground next to my horse. 

I was too young to understand the game but old enough to understand I disappointed my father. He was bummed I didn‚Äôt experience the joy of throwing the rings after he so proudly collected them for me.  I still remember his crestfallen face. 

He surely does not remember this moment, but for some reason, I do. I recall it occasionally and it always makes me feel the same bitter disappointment I felt at the time because I knew I‚Äôd let my dad down. 

I have a great relationship with my dad and he‚Äôs a wonderful dad. I have thousands of good memories with him. But, for some reason, this one has stuck the hardest. "
48,"I have heard that from many men. My ex said ""I hate it when women dyke out"" ..meaning when women cut their hair short. Anything above the shoulder was short to him."
49,"Ugh, a sex bucket just sounds like one more thing I'd have to clean."
50,Only spending any substantial amount of time with their kid on the weekends. 
51,"I once had a date with a guy who specifically said the whole ""you're not like *other girls*"", as in into shoes or feminine clothes/makeup and stuff. At the time I WAS basically wearing slightly baggy jeans and a black shirt because...I like to alternate, but c'mon, how does wearing heels make you inferior? Those fuckers require dedication."
52,"This is the other way round in Asia I guess, women are expected to be made fun of our height weight skin tone fashion sense, and we are not supposed to be mad. While men never have to take this kind of bullshit."
53,"&gt;it also may be illegal.

Yep. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits the operation of establishments that discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, and national origin."
54,Stila Stay All Day Liquid Liner is great. 
55,"I heard a guy say, ‚Äúbless you‚Äù one time... I lost it!"
56,"I find cotton thongs to be the most comfortable. Yes, there‚Äôs a string between your cheeks but ‚Äúfuller‚Äù underwear bunches up there and the ‚Äúno line‚Äù stuff also often does that thing where it dissects your butt cheeks in half like the ass version of quad boob.

So, cotton thongs. "
57,"There are more LGBTQ, women, and people of color running for office this election cycle than ever before in US history. 

18 states increased their minimum wages this year.

Cancer deaths in the US have dropped by 25% since 1991.

For the first time in history, half the people on the planet with HIV are getting treatment and AIDS deaths have dropped by half since 2005.

In just a few months, two parks at Walt Disney World Resort will be fully powered by solar energy. 

Volvo  has pledged that it's manufacturing and logistics will be carbon neutral by 2025.

There are still cat videos on the internet."
58,"I recently got into an argument with a dude about that.  ""Women don't *need* to buy new dresses, no one notices and they're the only ones who care.  It's not a big deal""


I wish I could take your comment and smack him in the face with it. "
59,"Honestly other women are the worst with this. It‚Äôs like, good for you that u bleed half a drop and get no cramps, not everyone has the same biology and no, just because you tried a certain birth control, diet or whatever does not mean it will be the same magic cure for everybody. I actually had a coworker stop me as I was headed to the ladies room once and I grabbed a pad from my desk drawer, she said ‚Äúoh god don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre still wearing those diapers! Use a tampon!‚Äù Like seriously? Can I choose my own products please? Lol "
60,"Steam message.

STEAM. 
MESSAGE.

This guy dumped me via STEAM MESSAGE! That's the chat system used in the popular online video gaming store/network on PC."
61,"Actually having a partner with the same sex drive as me. Guys always talk about getting laid, but somehow most girls Ive met have a bigger sex drive than most men. Wth.
I just wanna be able to have sex 5 times a day without feeling like im being too much."
62,"Sitting on my moms bathroom counter and watching her put on make-up. Her and my dad were getting ready for a date or something and were talking back and forth together and I was just sitting watching. My dad had shaved and combed his hair and put his cologne on, and my mom was putting on lipstick and mascara, her hair done up in curls. My baby sitter rolled in and we watched him play Sonic the hedgehog and Vampire Hunter D. "
63,Ok. Men will do it standing next to each other at a urinal and follow up with something witty like 'somebody stepped on a duck'. Personally I am not a barbarian so I always use a stall so I can wipe myself dry.
64,"I'm nauseated.

You must be pregnant.

*groan* Yep that's it, that's the reason. "
65,Have sex often and you're a slut. Have less/no sex and you're a prude. Can't win.
66,"That women can't get along in the workplace (or in MMOs, or anywhere I guess) and are constant drama. All of the women where I work get along just fine. Men (and the women who repeat this nonsense) just think their disagreements and gossip are important and see every conflict between women as frivolous. "
67,Adjusting your genitalia in public. 
68,"Making perfume from water, leaves, flowers and berries. "
69,"Recently widowed, at 61, I am likely never going to get laid again.  I do not have the patience or inclination to teach anyone how to navigate the specialized landscape. 

Still, reading through the bucket lists of others, hot damn, I was a freak.  "
70,I feel like I can't enjoy anything without being criticized for it. I order a pumpkin spice latte or a super fruity cocktail? I'm so basic. If I go out and order whiskey or a dark beer? I'm clearly just trying to impress the guys around me. I can't win.
71,"""Gather introvert energy"" haha... I too have hidden in bathrooms before. Not too bad a respite save for the smell."
72,"I‚Äôm not siding with him, but it really isn‚Äôt a big deal, even if someone mentions it - you don‚Äôt NEED to buy more dresses. 

I have three nice dresses I wear randomly to events. Even if someone commented on ‚Äúoh I‚Äôve seen that dress before‚Äù that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make it a big deal, or a reason for me to buy more dresses. 

Just say ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs a beautiful dress, I love the way it looks on me!‚Äù And move on with life. "
73,"When I‚Äôm sad I go look at medical news and inventions. It‚Äôs truly amazing what we can do by now.

For example, they were able to heal potentially chronically ill twins in the womb using stem cells. I‚Äôll try to find a link.

Edit: not quite healed it. [But still nice](https://blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/12/22/pregnant-womens-stem-cells-could-help-battle-brittle-bone-diseases-like-osteoporosis/) "
74,"That a thing majority women are interested in is inherently empty and meaningless and *silly*, but something like sports or video games or cars is just a normal interest and even if you get really emotional or obsessed or worked up over it, that's totally normal and regular.

But god forbid women or anyone really get invested in or obsessed with or worked up about any kinds of activities mostly women find interesting. Women in general, but teenage girls especially.

On that note, 'teenage girls' being used by everyone as a shorthand for a stupid and empty and shallow person. Teenage girls are half of all teenagers, half of all children become them and they in turn become half of all adults, thank you very much."
75,"I have a memory of waking up on a Sunday morning. I had to be a teenager because I had just recently moved my bed so that it was facing the window. Anyway, I had just woken up and I was waiting for my mom to come and get me out of bed. And as I lay there, I could see out the window and the sky was so blue. It was the most beautiful shade and there weren't many clouds so it was just gorgeous. I stayed there and my mom came up a little while later but I pretended to be asleep.

I've never seen the sky that blue again. 

Edit: I mean uneventful as in ""nothing happened"" but I just realized that an extraordinary blue sky might be a ""something. Apologies! "
76,"You have people complaining that she wears the same things, but you know that if she didn't then people would say she's materialistic and wasteful. There's no winning in this situation. :/"
77,"Same! If I don‚Äôt use a couple different products a day, my face becomes so dry it turns into patches of red and flakes. When my depression flares up and I sleep more than I should, I wake up to dry patches that are painful. Someone commented on my face creams in my bathroom like i was shallow for wanting to have smooth skin that didn‚Äôt hurt when I slept too long. *How dare I?*"
78,That's wrong... On so many levels.
79,"I did hear from him, actually.  He reached out, years later, asking me questions on organizing events and ticketing strategies (which I used to handle for his business). No apology or anything, which I‚Äôm not holding out for at this point in time anyway. I hope he‚Äôs treated with more compassion than he had for me if he ever finds himself in my place. 

I didn‚Äôt answer him. "
80,"My new office is about 30 feet long, and I'm alone in it.

My pod is great. 10/10 would recommend.

*edit-- we're still moving in to an offsite location  and not even my desk has arrived yet and I'm finding it hilarious. Please, step into [my](http://imgur.com/UFVIkGi) office.*"
81,"Well, that‚Äôs just adorable. "
82,"I can't explain it.  Something just popped in my mind one day while i was scowling at an incredibly cool looking chick on the bus, and suddenly my resentment turned to admiration. I just couldn't be bothered to carry around negative feelings about other women any more. It felt so much better to just admire and appreciate another person. I haven't looked back. "
83,Cracks me up when people start talking about hygeine. Somehow that only applies to women. Isn't even true anyway. Nothing unhygeinic about body hair unless you don't wash yourself. 
84,"I‚Äôm really good with kids and children tend to love me but I get so nervous when I consciously know people are watching me when I‚Äôm either playing or taking care of them. I¬†will get the usual ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd make such a great mom‚Äù  and ""When are you planning on having your own?"" and I just grimace internally because I‚Äôve never really wanted to have kids and I hate feeling like everyone expects me to. Why can‚Äôt I just be cool with kids and not have that weight hanging over my head? Like, if I ever actually say that I just get the whole ""You'll change your mind."" or ""That's a waste."" and that just pisses me off to all hell. If I want kids in the future, fine. If I don't, fine. How the fuck is that your business?"
85,"&gt; wipe myself dry.

At first I thought you meant from the fart, and I was gonna be like, ""Dude..."""
86,"To be honest I‚Äôve done most of the things I‚Äôve wanted to do, the only thing I‚Äôve not done is a very odd fantasy where I go to a hotel (with a partner) and dress fairly nice and sit in the bar alone, they come the bar and act as though we‚Äôve never met, we have a drink together and they leave me their room key. What then plays out after is a kind of ‚ÄòPretty Woman‚Äô scenario where I pretend I‚Äôm a high class prostitute, the other one is to be someone‚Äôs slave for a day as I‚Äôm normally in control in the bedroom, but I also like being in control and any time I get close to that happening I take over."
87,"Someone reported a break in in canada today. 2 housekeepers walked into the wrong (unlocked) house, and cleaned it. Neighbour thought they were breaking in so they called the cops. 

Canadian news is covering it but I am sure it isnt mainstream. "
88,"I guess it isn‚Äôt extremely sexual, but I‚Äôve wanted to try skinny dipping with and SO.  That little thrill of not getting caught sounds exhilarating. 

My currently boyfriend and I haven‚Äôt gotten very far physically yet and he‚Äôs rather shy. I‚Äôd love to see the look on his face in that context. "

93,"Women being less logical or having ""inherent"" thinking styles, that sort of bullshit"
94,"Absolutely. People who equate womanhood to motherhood, or worse, marriage to parenthood, are really aggravating. Like, no, I don't have children of my own, but I am still a valuable human being with a happy marriage and a full life - no, I don't ""regret"" it, no my husband doesn't feel like a failure... drives me bonkers"

100,"So true.  Twilight is a great example.  Yes, they're shitty books.  But do you know what else are shitty books?  Half the mass market thrillers on the shelf at the bookstore are just as bad, but they don't get nearly the same flack.

Teens have a tendency to be stupidly passionate about things.  But while boys can get away with memorizing every player in the NFL, girls will get put down for doing the same thing with Twilight characters."

103,"Femininity, as a whole, requires INCREDIBLE dedication. The makeup, the hair, the uncomfortable clothes/shoes... Those women have a higher tolerance for pain and discomfort than anyone I know. I can barely wobble around in a 2"" platform, and pretty much exclusively wear clothes with stretch in them. I'm a soft squishy powder puff compared to dedicated glamazons!  


ETA: AND THE NAILS! Omg, how do you even get anything DONE with them? But you know what? THEY DO. "

"
110,"I‚Äôm looking forward to sex with no condoms. I absolutely do not want a child with anyone until I‚Äôm married or at least engaged. So for me, condoms + an  IUD are a must until then. I went condom free twice with an ex before I changed my mind and it really is so much better. 

ETA: wow this comment blew up. Thanks for the reassurances about the reliability of IUDs, but while pregnancy is my main concern, I‚Äôm also interested in the protection it gives me from STDs. I believe it‚Äôs the responsibility of every adult engaging in sex outside a marriage to mitigate all potential risks to the best of their ability.  Sex is also more enjoyable for me if I‚Äôm not stressed about potential consequences. "
111,"I‚Äôm here to throw in the perspective of someone who grew up in poverty but is doing pretty okay now.

My family moved houses a lot when I was a kid because we were always getting evicted for not making rent. One time we stayed in a house for 5 years, but we only afforded the rent for that long because we went without heat or electricity and got most of our food from the food bank. For years the only way I could bathe was heating water on a camp stove and pouring it over myself in a cold, dark bathroom. My family always dealt with the stress by getting angry and frustrated, focusing on what went wrong. The way *I* dealt with it was to adopt a problem-solving attitude. I remember sitting in a motel room with my family after an eviction, my dad pacing around and yelling about how we should never have done this thing or that thing and it took everything I had in me to finally convince him that it doesn‚Äôt help to get upset about what‚Äôs already happened. The fact is, we were in that motel room and the ONLY thing to do was figure out what to do next. I think this is so, so important. Be a problem-solver, not a complainer!

Also, the poverty cycle is a very real thing. Poverty teaches people to:

1. only buy the *cheapest* things

2. value *making ends meet* above everything else

3. be *risk-averse*

Children born into poverty most often continue to live in poverty as adults *because* of this poverty mindset. The way to get out of this is to break that mindset. Everything you do along the way will feel like a terribly unsafe decision, but it‚Äôs the only way to change the situation. So:

1. buy the *best value* thing in your price range, even if it costs more than the cheapest thing. This will save you money because you will purchase less often.

2. value *your time* above money. I know this sounds counter-intuitive. But you will achieve more when you‚Äôre relaxed, well-slept, and make yourself a priority by taking some time for hobbies. You will have the time to plan for your future instead of only planning how you‚Äôll get through the next week.

3. learn to *take risks*. Get an education even if it means taking on debt. Apply for a better job even if it means leaving the security of your old one. You *are* capable of navigating those changes. It‚Äôs scary, but I promise you it‚Äôs easier than a lot of the difficulties you‚Äôve navigated before.

I know this might sound a little preachy, but this is how I handled it. I‚Äôm in my late 20s now and I live comfortably on my own without ever having to worry about making rent. I have a degree, a ton of student debt that I‚Äôm confident will be paid off when I have a job (currently earning a master‚Äôs to improve my qualifications), and I‚Äôm doing it without the safety net of family money. And I‚Äôm proud of myself for making it here. :)"

125,"Journaling.

&amp;#x200B;

List the behavior, for example: ""Regarding a recent argument- me getting really defensive and angry when someone is trying to explain things to me.""

Then go deeper, ask questions. Get to the bottom of that behavior and find the triggers.

Does this happen all the time? ""No, just when I feel like I'm smart enough to figure it out on my own, but at that moment I am struggling, likely to see something obvious, or missing a key piece of information, or the issue is in an area that I already have a good amount of knowledge and I am livid I cannot seem to find the answer on google.""

Is it just in certain situations or with certain people? ""There are some people with whom I don't get defensive. And there are some who aggravate me more. My mother, and my partner. Hmm. Both feel like they are being incredibly condescending, and sometimes interrupt, when I am trying to explain things. As well, if someone attempting to explain something starts with elements I already know, (rather than the part I am specifically struggling with) I feel angry and believe they are challenging my intelligence.""

Interesting...

Keep asking questions. Is this an issue that involves sorting out communication with those people? On top of culling my own anger? Or does this have anything to do with needing others to understand that I am intelligent and capable? Is there a way I can better explain in the moment how I'm feeling? Is there a better way they could explain things?

Etc...  Just remember it's important is to be honest."

130,"So many involve my stepdad. He taught me how to garden and can the harvest. Sitting on the front porch snapping beans, going wild berry picking in the woods, loading wood he just chopped into the wagon, etc. Just spending time with him are the moments I'll never forget. The one that really sticks with me is the early winter mornings. He'd get up early to make me a hot breakfast and he'd sit there and drink his coffee and just chat about stuff. How the littlest pig was catching up with his siblings, how school was going, how we would need to chop more wood soon. My mom married him when I was nine and he died when I was 14. For five short years I had a parent who actually loved me. Even at that young age, I knew the significance of that.

""Why aren't you smiling?""

""You would be so much more attractive if you smiled""

This happened again a few days ago after I had just completed a clear and brilliant laser facial so my skin was super tight while healing. I kept a neutral face position as best I could which was the most comfortable but dude came up and not only told me to smile more but also said I should not try to hide my smile either ""because it makes women the most beautiful"". 

I figure he added that last bit because he was clearly watching me switch between my book and phone. I was texting my bf between pages so I cannot help but smile when I text him but had to try and ignore the reaction at that time. 

I had to really fight the urge to not tear this guy a new one since I was at work. Even when dressed professionally in scrubs and a lab coat while working in a very prestigious hospital I find some people have a low threshold for common sense, respect and personal space.

As I watched him approached me, I assumed he was a patient looking for directions or to ask some ridiculous question that was out of my scope of practice so as I lifted my head up I managed as much of a smile as I comfortably could while waiting for him to speak. I even tried to 'smile with my eyes' but clearly that was not enough."

222,"I was about 4, or almost 4.

I was sitting in my granny's car, waiting for my mom to come out from a store.  My grandma forced my mom to sell her guitar.

My brother was in school, so it was me and granny only.  That was never good.

I saw my mom walking back to the car after selling the guitar.  I remember feeling stunned by my mom's beauty and grace.  My young mind thought, that my mom was other worldly beautiful.  Immediately, I was overtaken by the idea of a butterfly being caught and crushed to death.  The butterfly being my mom, the crusher being people like my Granny.

When my mom got to the car, she smiled at me and offered two fists.  I knew that meant she had two treats, and I was allowed to pick mine and save the other for my brother.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke down sobbing and mom was alarmed.  She asked granny what she'd said/done to me.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I remember, but it's a film strip that runs through my mind.  It comes out of nowhere, and I'm always brought to tears.  But, more happy now that I can recall that and not the sadness around it.

223,"On Whatsapp.... after over 10 years of relationship. 

We were long distance then, and we gradually drifted apart. I didn't want to end it first, because he had promised we'd be together again soon and it'd all be good, but then he started saying how unhappy he was, basically listing all the things I had done wrong - I think to try to force me to be the one to end it cause he didn't wanna look like ""the bad guy"". So when I didn't, he said it's over. To think I wasn't even worth a phone call or something... some guys...

The best part was that a month later he begged me to speak to him again, to think things over because he regretted the breakup. I reluctantly agreed to speak, see what he had to say, but he flat-out ghosted me before that happened. And then a month after that, he contacted me yet again blaming me for ""not showing enough initiative"" to get back together, etc... (I didn't even want to get back together!) I finally told him he has to stop contacting me for real."

226,"That women can‚Äôt have any sort of standards when it comes to men. Women grow up believing they have to look *perfect* at all moments of the day and that our appearance is the center of our self-worth. So we try and try to make ourselves look as beautiful as possible and we listen to men ramble on and on about their criticisms on women‚Äôs appearance but if a woman dare rejects a man on the basis of appearance, men go into crazy, bitter meltdowns and start writing essays on why women are evil for having sex with men they find attractive. 

Men really think that they‚Äôre entitled to women when they go around looking homeless. Especially when most of these men only want women who look like models "
227,"Ghosting after a 6 month relationship. It was like, 6 years ago and I kinda understand it now, but damn. 

Dude had Aspergers. He was in a band that were starting to get successful, he was in college, he was starting a new job and we lived 4 hours apart.

I‚Äôd go down to see him about twice a week. I thought I was seeing him when he was free - turned out he was missing college to see me. I told him to stop doing that and just see me less. 

He got super overwhelmed about everything he had going on but assured me, we were fine.

Then he said his phone broke and he could only email me when he was in college. So, our contact was down to one email during the day.

After like, 3 weeks of that I asked when his phone would be fixed and he said he‚Äôd sent it off to the phone repair people and didn‚Äôt know when he‚Äôd have it back. I rang him. The phone rang. I looked up some pictures from a gig he‚Äôd just done and sure enough, in his skin tight jeans, you could see the outline of his phone in his pocket.

I asked him about it and never heard from him ever again.

I get it. He was overwhelmed, he didn‚Äôt wanna give up the band, he needed to focus on college and he needed the new job. I understand that he wasn‚Äôt great at communication so breaking up with me would have been hard. But eek, I‚Äôm a chilled out person, my response would have been ‚Äúthat sucks but I understand.‚Äù.

Her success doesn‚Äôt mean my failure. Someone else in this world could be looking at me the same way I‚Äôm looking at her.

People are like flowers in a garden. Each individual flower is beautiful. No one looks at a garden and starts searching for the most perfect flower and labels the rest as inferior and ugly. The beauty of a garden comes from all the flowers thriving together, each a different color and height and shape. 

When you see someone you admire, tell them. You don‚Äôt know that she isn‚Äôt looking to someone else feeling inferior. If we all started telling each other how we felt, we‚Äôd all be happier. 

Not to get all political here, but there‚Äôs a reason the trope of women competing for men‚Äôs attention and success is pushed on us repeatedly. Society wants us to in competition with each other and tear each other down, because the alternative means we would ban together, support each other, believe each other, and hold the rest of society accountable.

One night we got into another huge fight about his drinking so I ended up leaving him at the bar and drove off by myself. I pulled over and sobbed my eyes out and at one point just started screaming at no one in particular, ""What do I do?? Someone tell me what I‚Äôm supposed to do!"" Like a crazy person, just screaming to myself in the car. I regained my composure after a while and drove home. 

Cut to a few weeks later and I find out I‚Äôm pregnant. Cut again to the morning of the ultrasound and of course he is so drunk he can‚Äôt get himself off the couch so I‚Äôm already furious. But because I‚Äôm a pushover I let him get himself together and he comes with me to the appointment. At which point I find out I‚Äôm actually miscarrying.

And my lovely fianc√© says to me ""Can you drop me off at the bar on your way to the lab? I can‚Äôt handle this.""

It was right at that point that I knew this pregnancy wasn‚Äôt meant to be, it was my sign from the universe.

I mean, everyone knows guys get aroused.  But there are still some people out there who deny that women have sexuality or get sexually excited, and think women are just reluctant gate-keepers to sex.

If men could see the things that turned women on, if there was open physical signals of women's arousal, I think more men would understand women's sexuality and respect that it exists, and there'd be a lot more sexually fulfilled women.

Steven King‚Äôs book *It* has a scene near the end where all the boys in the group (all around age 11-12) have sex with the only girl in the group (age 11) essentially to lift their spirits.

Beverly‚Äôs desires are positioned as a way for her to overcome her own fears around sex, but mostly the narrative centers on how the boys literally enter adulthood through Beverly‚Äôs vagina. King released a statement a few years ago through his fan site Stephenking.com, where he wrote, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really thinking of the sexual aspect of it‚Ä¶ Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again.

336,"&gt; **Clubs and other associations for people who share a protected characteristic**

&gt; The Act allows private clubs and other associations (except political parties) to restrict membership to people who share protected characteristics.

&gt; **What has changed?**

&gt; The Act maintains the previous exceptions allowing clubs to restrict their membership according to race and sexual orientation and extends it, in line with the extended protection from discrimination, to also cover gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, religion or belief, and sex.

&gt;  Example: It is lawful to have a private club for women, for people from Australia, for transsexual people or for people who are HIV positive.

&gt; However, it is still unlawful for a private club that restricts its membership to people who share particular protected characteristics to discriminate against members, associates, or guests because of other protected characteristics.

&gt; Example: Ahmed is a Muslim gay man and would like to join a city choir specifically for gay men.The choir can restrict its membership based on the protected characteristics of sex and sexual orientation, but cannot discriminate against Ahmed because of his religion. Therefore the choir cannot refuse membership to Ahmed, or treat him less favourably, because he is a Muslim.

347,"At my university there was a bathroom nobody used - it was further away from all the places people hung out, so it was just not convenient to go to. Everyone essentially designated it the pooping bathroom, since the chances of someone else being in there were slim to none. 

On the one hand, it was nice to go to a bathroom in public and feel like I could let ‚Äòer rip without social stigma, but on the other hand it‚Äôs fucking sad that this even existed. 

I‚Äôm a farty person. It just runs in my family. And my farts are often the loud, drawn out kind, like a very bad trumpet player slowly collapsing. That‚Äôs just how my butt works. And I honestly hate that it‚Äôs so socially unacceptable to let my body do its stuff. "
348,"i think i subconsciously associate armpit hair with bad hygiene because, as a hairy man, the mess of hair that flourishes under there prevents antiperspirant from reaching the skin properly unless i shave about once a week.

i'd like to think it isn't a gendered thing, since i'm not all that keen on men's pit hair either, but it's probably more likely that i started out disliking it on women because cultural sexism, and later on realised it was nasty on dudes too. either way, it's something i should just get over"
349,"Essential oils... really any MLM (multilevel marketing)

I hate the pseudoscience behind it and how horrible these companies are for deceiving people."
350,"Back when I was using LinkedIn to find my first post-college job (2011 or so), I got a few creepy/inappropriate messages from dudes. At the time, LinkedIn had no feature that allowed you to block other users. That's when I realized they likely had few women working for them."
351,"I'm confused by that. Is it an alcohol license thing? Because:

* Women-only gyms are a thing
* Some hairdressers only serve women
* Some swimming pools have women only times
* There are kink/sex clubs that let women in free, couples for a moderate price and single men in for very high prices.

In Australia where I live some clubs do have women only nights, but I'm guessing tour area has different laws.

This isn't a ""you're wrong"" because different places are different. I'm genuinely curious what rules ban it.

Partly because it sounds like a good idea and I have friends I know who'd enjoy it - bi and gay friends but also straight or straightish friends in long term relationships with non-partying non-dancing types who'd enjoy a night out without getting sleazed on. (Well, by guys anyway). I can't see any in my city just some clubs that do ""girls' nights"" often at low demand times."
352,"It's hard to understand why society finds the sight of a painful rash more acceptable than hair on a woman. Same for pubic hair and armpits. 

I used to get awful rashes from shaving but I've completely given up now. I no longer shave and it's so liberating. I may get some looks but I feel like the world needs to get over itself and it won't if there's no one defying the norms. "

360,"Grew up on a small 300 pop town. Got out as fast as I could! Moved out of state with a boy I started dating at 14. He was 18. It was ok till after highschool when we moved. Then I got prego. I stopped all drugs, alcohol, smoking. He didn‚Äôt.  Then the physical abuse started. I started realizing things were not my fault and after 5 more years and two kids I finally found my window to escape. Clothes on our backs and 1900 miles to get to safety. A year of healing and I decided to go back to my hometown. 
 Who was the very first to greet me as I pulled in? My gmas neighbor boy I played with as kids, gave rides to in highschool. He wasn‚Äôt a boy anymore. He was sneaky though! I played the friend relationship for a few months. Then on a quad ride to a Hayfield he says, ‚Äúcan I kiss you?‚Äù I say ‚Äú yes, but it won‚Äôt mean anything!‚Äù I was still broken and thought men were only good for one thing. Here we go again, ugh! 
It was amazing! But stubborn me denied denied. We fooled around for three months. I finally gave in we started dating and introduced him to my kids. Slowly he started taking over. Leaving more stuff at my place, offering to do more man things for me. I had a fixer upper so plenty to do. 6 more months and we were married. 
10 years and two more kids later, I know I made the right decision. I am still broken, ptsd, lots of anxiety, other mi diagnosis due to a life full of trauma. But now I can breath. He is my safe place. Everyday I feel loved. I try to return the love the best I can. I didn‚Äôt know such a gentle man existed. We have lived on the same property as the hayfield for a long time. We celebrated our 10 year with a picnic to the same spot our worlds changed. Absolutely love this man!"

367,Yeah my friends and I hit up and support the local LGBT bar. In support of her but also because it is the one place everyone seems to go to have a good dance and can read body language well. All it takes is to give someone space and they know you aren't interested. Imagine that.

371,The failure rate for hormonal IUDs is actually lower than the failure rate for female sterilization. Obviously you shouldn't do something you're not comfortable with but if pregnancy is the only reason you're still using condoms then you're being a bit paranoid. 
372,I don't think you're an asshole. I think society is the asshole for making those stupid bathrooms where you have to sit 1 foot away from someone taking a deuce with only a slice of tin foil between you.
373,Especially coming from guys that everyone has to tiptoe around because they are stubborn and have a short fuse. All the screaming matches in meetings at work have involved men who weren't getting their way.  But yeah it's women who are the drama queens /s.
374,I pretty much ONLY wear dresses cause they're so comfy and make me feel confident and I get asked why I dont wear a tshirt and jeans often. Jeans are stiff and I hate them. I also always wear short heeled sandals or boots cause I like the click clack the sound makes. So weird that people want me to dress more casually. 
375,"Every time I see a line of women out the bathroom and no line for men I think how all public bathrooms must be designed by men. Same with workspaces that don't accommodate breastfeeding or pregnant women, they're just people whose experiences in these places weren't thought about enough/at all"
376,"I was in a bar with my sister last year and a guy came up and struck up a conversation with me. I strategically mentioned ""oh I know that place, I went there with my fianc√©"". He suddenly flipped from seemingly decent guy to angry twitching guy demanding to know what I was doing in a bar without my significant other and leading him on (we had been taking for 3-5 minutes by this stage about movies and restaurants. How that was leading him on I don't know, but he clearly had ulterior motives by his ""friendly conversation""). What I'm trying to get at is, sometimes it's a defense mechanism to cut to the chase and bluntly announce our relationship status because we are so used to guys who behave like the guy I described. I'm not saying it's polite to the individual guy, I'm saying it's a self-protection thing (in a lot of cases. Obviously there are rude women too). We have to be blunt because so many guys will wilfully ignore or misinterpret ""soft nos"" like ""I'm actually just here for a girls night"" or ""I should probably get back to my friends now."" I'm not trying to excuse rudeness, I'm just giving you a reason as to why SOME women might do that."

388,"I disagree. I understand how/why she sees it that way. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate. POTUS should be held to a higher standard, especially when it comes to interns. I‚Äôm not allowed to sleep with interns at my job either, even if they‚Äôre a willing participant. While I do not think that an intern can‚Äôt consent, there absolutely is a power imbalance especially when the President of the United States is involved. Monica Lewinsky was an adult and as far as I‚Äôm aware she wasn‚Äôt coerced and pursued him (I think) but he took advantage of her naivety and it was on him to stop it before it ever began.

I am not surprised by her opinion, though - most women my age (40s+) seem to think the same way."

391,"Positive self talk, seems silly but every day I wake up and tell myself it‚Äôs gonna be a good day and it usually is.

Be that anger or rage, it‚Äôs no more insidious than a man‚Äôs. It‚Äôs not feminist rage or any other derogatory label!

398,That self care is important and necessary.  That sometimes being selfish is mandatory and not to feel guilty about it.  It‚Äôs hard to take care of everyone else when your own tank is empty.

400,"iZombie is made by the same guy who did Veronica Mars. It's about a doctor who gets turned into a zombie because of a combination of a street drug and an energy drink. In order to get access to human brains, she becomes a medical examiner for the police. By eating brains, she helps solve their murders because she can have flashbacks of their memories; she also takes on pieces of the personality of the brain she's eaten, which is frequently hilarious and a great way to keep the show fresh. I'm usually pretty unimpressed with zombie stuff because I feel it's just so overdone, but it's a really fun show (and I love procedural crime dramas).

Brooklyn 99 is a great, diverse police comedy series that deals with some serious issues and has a fucking fantastic cast."
401,"I did this when I evacuated for the hurricane a few weeks ago. It...was...amazing. Literally had nothing else to do other than play video games on our laptops, eat takeout, sleep, watch cartoons, and fuck whenever we wanted. God it was amazing. I recommend it 1000000000%"

ETA: if you‚Äôre really anti-thong, the key to finding full coverage panties that are actually no show is looking for very flat seams, thin material and sizing up. I if they fit too snugly they‚Äôll create a indentation where the leg hole is, especially if you‚Äôre on the curvier side. "

407,"&gt; The stereotype of the ""mean girl.""

This one has never made much sense to me. Like, yeah, there were a few girls in my high school who were catty and backstabbing, but most of us were pretty chill. And even the ones who were part of that ""popular"" group, most of them were only like that while surrounded by the others, but were nice on their own. It was two or three toxic people making the whole group toxic. People always say teen girls are vicious, but my experience has been completely the opposite. Some of my high school friends are still the most supportive people in my life. I work with teenagers now, and the girls almost always take really good care of each other."
