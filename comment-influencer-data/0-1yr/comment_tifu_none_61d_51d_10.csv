Nice going dickhead
You were confronted with information that disagreed with what you knew. Absorbed that information and changed your position. A+ human being.
What a power move from your dad. He just showed you how he left your siblings to death on your bathroom tiles.
Tomorrow you'll have to tan your other testicle then. It'd be awkward to have a tan line there once you do get lucky.
There is a lot of live in that man.
Only solution is to hide the hickey by putting the dick back
"Old person here: what is Chad supposed to mean in this context? Chad has always been short-hand for ""douche bro"" in my world..."
Just get married. Your karma assets will be combined.
"More of a ding than a dong, huh?"
"If you have a possibly terminal illness, marriage makes a BIG difference to you and your partner. It means that nothing and no one can deny K the right to visit you and be with you if and when you are dying.  It means that she, and not your parents, will have permission to make medical decisions for you if you are incapacitated -- this may be very important to you if your dad tends to be controlling. And it will make it easier to pass on any property to her if you do die; you would likely make her the beneficiary of your life insurance. Whether or not you get married or are merely engaged, you should write a will and a medical directive."
the tldr is my fav
"To be totally fair, “States Rights” and “the economy” were *MAJOR* issues related to the civil war. 

What some southern folks like to forget or omit is the context of those issues:

The right of a state to “own” slaves which provided significant, free labor to “the economy.”  

When you add the context, it’s a ‘holy shit that’s racist’ lightbulb."
"She tried to go down on his pickle,    
But all he could feel was a tickle,    
Her frisky mood ended,    
When his leg extended,    
And halted her head with a kickle."
Your definition is still the current definition. I'm not sure what OP is on about
Or he plans to murder his son at some point in the future
It’s a good thing you didn’t clench your teeth when you got hit.
I'm soft in so many ways right now.
Tomorrow: TIFU by not going to the hospital after sitting on my nuts and blacking out - causing a torsion that required amputation
"This is a nice TIFU, a welcome detour away from all the sex and incest in this sub lately.

I think next time you should order to hotel through some app or something if their food is not up to par or too expensive."
"OP’s referring to the incel chad. They call every guy who “gets girls” a Chad. Which is still in line with them thinking that Chad is a douche bro, but they all wish to be like him with his square jaw and towering height over their poor sub 6 feet manlet frame. That’s the cliche at least.

Incels are weird man."
"That end got me, might do it again lol"
At least you didn’t watch it on VR
Unlike your old man I see
"Oh yeah, plus it was cold in the morning. You're making me shudder again with the memory."
"Oh man, that’s a tough one to recover from. Was it at its smallest?"
"Thank you for the kind words. It's scary to admit ignorance about something important like this. But it happened, and if it happened to me it probably happened to others. :("
"Instructions unclear, dick stuck in fan."
Good on you for being able to see the funniness in that story and willing to use it to ask her out instead of being super embarrassed and afraid to ask her out again! It will be a great story you can tell in the future regardless of whether you and her work out. Best of luck OP
"That’s okay. One time I was at a funeral for a friend who died suddenly and tragically at a young age. He was all dressed up in a nice suit and tie in his casket. After viewing his body, me and the rest of my friends were standing outside awkwardly trying to think of something to say. Someone remarked how odd it was to see our pal dressed up in a suit and I just blurted out, “Yeah, he wouldn’t have been caught *dead* in that outfit!” It’s been 10 years and I’m honestly still embarrassed when I think of this moment."
One does not simply walk out of Mordor.
Maybe but it’d also be a great conversation starter before hand
"It will be like - 

Doc - ""You must really stop doing wierd shit with your dick.""

OP - ""No, I don't think i will."""
"I want to say in a non-sexual way how much enjoyment I have been getting imagining a guy with his dick in a fan and talking to his sister with his phone rigged around his neck. Then explaining it to fucking urgent care.

That is one hell of an elaborate jacking off adventure. As a woman I simply cannot imagine after the original fan wasn't good enough, walking to fucking Walmart, standing in the fan section comparing specks on flashlight spinning ability. Then shamelessly running home (without forgetting the hands free phone contraption for extra pleasure) to duct tape the item of your affection to the blades of the fan. You needed duct tape and a fucking screw driver to jack off.  In all seriousness though I'm so glad you have no permanent damage. God Speed on your next adventure."

"You panicked.

Enjoy what you can in life now, you won't always get a second chance.

Also you should do right by your K and propose to HER in front of that restaurant.

It will make her happy and redeem some face."
Seems like a pretty close family.  I think I may know this dude. Is his name Oedipus?

"I've got a similar, shorter story:

Girlfriend and I were talking about dirty things we'd like to try and she asks if I'd like to be woken up with a blowjob. My dumbass responds with something along the lines of, ""Of course, my last girlfriend used to do that all the time!"" 

...................

Needless to say she has never given me a wake-up blowjob."
Kind of reminds me of buying a new cell phone and having a hard time hearing anything. Turns out there was a thin protective film over the surface including the speaker.

"Lesson learned: If you're going to sneak into an area you don't belong dressed as a worker, make sure to take note of what the badges look like."
These arguments are part of why gay marriage was such a big deal. People don't grasp what marriage actually is and does for people. It's not just a ceremony. That's the wedding. Marriage itself is very important for couples legally.
But did you beat this deuuuck tho
But.....did it burst your sexy bubble?
"Sorry, it took me so long to get here, how can I help?"
Probably would have but her post notifications and new found karma distracted from the mood.... I truly fucked up.
Sounds like he did the real fuck up by watching porn at work and then forgoing his own paycheck cuz of it.
"They noticed, and didn't say anything. Now they will notice you don't stink, and silently appreciate that you figured your personal hygiene out."
My first husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer 5 days after we were married. He lived 5 months. I wouldn’t trade the time we had together for the world. Live your life.
Damn. That’s deep.
Or with earpods in!
Shouldve let that last one rip. Assert dominance
"The popular opinion is that she's cheating on you. Let me offer an alternative. All of her behavior can be explained by complete and total blushing down to your ankles embarrassment. 

Yes, she may have fantasies about Stephen. There have been numerous women I've worked with that I've had wank level fantasies about. I've even almost said their name in that really awkward moment. Did I keep my pants zipped? Yes because on that kinda guy. 

Why she not answering your phone call or answering text?. Embarrassment, trying to stay focused on the job, and not want to put up with your jealous shit.

So don't text her, don't call her let things ride. Don't pounce on her as soon as she gets home to try and talk about this. But make it very clear that you are concerned that you are feeling jealous and you would like to talk about it with her when she is ready. 

That's the theory anyway. I know I would be as wound up as you are if that happened to me. But I would try to reframe the experience into something less stressful so I could continue to function in my own job and day-to-day."
"It's like the saying goes.

Those who know little about the civil war think it is about slavery.

Those who know a medium amount about the civil war think it is about state rights.

Those who know a lot about the civil war know it was about slavery."
"I misread title

Thought it said ""from a mug that had a dick in it"", was very confused so had to click"
My favorite rebuttal towards the “states rights” argument is - “States rights TO WHAT?” (spoiler! Slaves)
"Asking the real questions here I see lol.

 Not that night. Was too horrified of what happened since I have pretty bad anxiety. Didn't turn out as bad as I thought it would though."
No one will judge you... you're just a unicorn!
"She might have left simply because she's really picky about balls and yours don't match her particular taste.  Better to find out that you're incompatible now than after you waste time wineing and dining her.

This is why we really need to stop the constant media objectification of testes.  It leads to unrealistic expectations with too many sub-avocado sized men having low self esteem."
"I miss Japan. Family mart, 7 eleven, Lawson in every corner."
Do it to your whole face so it blends in
This is the sweetest TIFU. No coke bottles up your butt or dumping blood all over a boyfriend’s bathroom. Just wholesome.
"Well, it was a *flash* drive, after all."
i’m pretty sure usually you’ll have the conversation BEFORE letting her take a peek at the nuts
"""Left the table with my naked mug man in hand"" has got me cracking up.

Beautiful timing to find out about your dick mug. Your friends are great."
So did she give it to you or not?
"That was a meme, that was SUPPOSED TO STAY A MEME

FFS, guys"
He could have been doing something much worse than just porn to vanish like that.
"No that's great.

Funerals are there to have a last quip with the people you love about and with the person you lost.

Honestly a lighthearted joke like that can really have a stressrelieaving effect on people.

It puts alot of things into perspective."
It depends on who gets custody of the throwaway accounts.
If I had thought for even a second that would have been perfect
"This dude is an idiot. Not only did he watch porn at work, he didn't even delete his browser history afterwards? Or use an incognito mode? Fucking hell"
"inserting flash drives into your computer unknowingly is a dangerous game...

&amp;#x200B;

My roomie did this once with a random one he found and his PC was immediately infected by about five viruses. Hilarious meltdown ensued."
I would think the almost knocked out thing may not lead to that
My biggest question about this situation: Who slips the thumb in first???
I got a major laugh from this. Totally interrupted my entire row at the office. Thank you.
"""TIFU by realizing all my discord friends are incels"""
"Man... THIS shit right here is why I posted this... I want this SO FUCKING BAD to be it. I’m like practically crying I want this so bad. I don’t care if she’s THINKING about this guy like stupid fantasy stuff, I just can’t handle her DOING anything about it. God I want it to be this. Thank you for giving me something to hold on to."
"My mom called me once and kept complaining that she was having trouble hearing me. After the call, I got a rather sheepish text from her that the phone had been upside down."
TIL that you are not supposed to show your nuts before starting the conversation.
What the fuck is this entire thread.
his version of incognito mode is just starting a new life
"Well, I'm still waiting for his ""TIFU by watching porn at work and forgoing my own paycheck"""
Damn it. I wish I used this in my post
"How do you know SHE didn't take ya nut out while you were sleeping man?

Stranger things have happened."
Yeah this definition makes the most sense with what op is saying and I'm sure his friends are just joking and are not actually incels.
And yet operating the mouse and the flashlight at the same time was “too cumbersome.”
"Agree, that part is on me, but I wasn't expecting someone to come over and when it's just me and my wife at home, door is mostly closed"
or with both arms broken
"I had a steam friend who hadn't logged in for 1000+ days. People wrote things on his profile to admit that they  were missing him. One day, he logged in again. He told us he had served for military and moved in in a new house with his girlfriend and hadn't found the time yet to set up his gaming equipments."
Should keep us posted with happens between you guys and if you can find anything out
"Yes but only after two weeks or so, when I sorted everything out and matured to the decision. At first I didn't because he could get mad as the business was slightly screwed for a while. No info about the things the employee was working on etc. I preferred to let things cool down first."
Didn’t see that one coming.

Did you ever tell your dad what happened?
it got me to read the whole thing.

Lived in japan for a few years.  I'm certain they were trying to help you and understood the embarrassment.  I'm also fairly certain someone stood there with your food for a while in case you came back for it.  Hahaha good story.
"Now OP just needs to cum in his bathroom, film it, upload in a flash drive, and leave the flash drive in his father's house for him to find"
"I have a steam friend that hasn't logged in for a year and a half. He was near some California fires last I spoke to him so I'm worried he didn't make it. I'm kinda hoping if something did happen, maybe his stuff just got burnt up and he hasn't built a new PC yet.... I miss him"

"Yeah, cuz otherwise I’m just sitting here with myself with nothing to do but think. Part of me wants to like fly out there, but that’s fucking stupid, what am I gonna do, spy on them like it’s a fucking movie? Can you imagine the shit if she caught me doing that? I might as well just file for divorce and save myself the trip.

I don’t know anybody she works with to really ask about this guy... she got like two close friends, I asked the one I know best if she know if my wife was “mad at me”, she basically told me she wasn’t gonna get in the middle of it and I should just talk to her, so that was no help.

I may just drink to the point I can get to sleep. Anything but sit and think and run fucking scenarios... heh, yeah, “fucking” scenarios. My brain fucking hates me."
Testicular Torsion would be a rad name for a death-metal band
Worse than that: [Read the Confederate Constitution](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_csa.asp). It actually restricted states' rights in many ways.

Oh god this story just gets better and better
When I was 16 I overheard my mom on the phone talking to the man she was cheating on my dad with.   He eventually found out on his own but I wish I had said something to him.  You did the right thing.
"Hi friend the spelling for the word you want is palate. 

It’s tricky because there are 3 words sound alike. 

Pallet- wood thing for stacking cases of goods on a truck 

Palate- refers to your culinary tastes 

Palette- the thing an artist holds with dollops of paint on it, or a number of colors of makeup offered in a single package.

Does your wife appreciate you leaving the door ajar so she can share in the sounds and smells of your bowel movements?
"I find ignorance is super easy to admit because it’s not anybody’s fault you weren’t taught. You can be very smart but ignorant. 

Stupidity is embarrassing to admit, but it’s easy to not be stupid. All you have to do is admit when you’re wrong and learn from new information. 

Also, the system tries to suppress information. I’m not surprised I didn’t know any of this stuff. Good on you for digging up the truth. 

TIL"
"Pure laziness. Once we started farting in front of each other, anything goes."

Good way to test the waters while still having an alibi. You sneaky son of a bitch.

"We laughed, actually. And dad lost hope that the guy is going to come back."
Remember that just cause you found them that doesn't make any of this your fault. Your father made the decision to be nude in bed with the family friend and that has nothing to do with you or your actions.

"Similar story: my bf (now fiance) and I were at a music festival a year ago and we were on day 2 and I hadn't gone to sleep yet, was feeling a bit frisky so I went to wake him up. He had a GIGANTIC erection and I figured I'd wake him up with a blow job. 

Nope. The moment I touched his dick, he rolled over in his sleep, slapped the ever-loving fuck out of me and mumble-yelled ""I have a GIRLFRIEND!""

I was the weirdest combination of offended and flattered."
"In the last couple months there has been weird sexual stories. Like people getting married but finding out they were related, or how a dude accidentally lead his step sister to believe he liked her and she started stripping in front of him. Some wack stuff"
"OMG this happened to the wife and me too. She wanted to surprise me with some “sexy time” and was amazed that there was a jet tub as well. 

Whelp, same results as what happened to you. Except we were already IN the tub. Yup we both disappeared. Laughter gave way to panic on the ensuing onslaught of bubbles. 

Me to the rescue: “...sigh, grab the conditioner dear. “ A couple of squirts and we watched as the wall of bubbles slowly melts away."

"The big fight in the North in the 1850s if you ever read The Liberator or other abolitionist newspapers was that the [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850#New_law) forced northern states to return escaped slaves to bondage in the south. Northern police who didn't apprehend and return escaped slaves were subject to federal fines. Of course, northern states did not want to do this; especially New England states that had abolished slavery before the first Constitutional Convention. For one, it cost money to find, round up, and ship people back. For two, it was simply not something the states wanted to do and very unpopular. But the south insisted upon it and due to the Compromise of 1850, made it a federal law. This made northern states complicit in slavery against their will. And that's what really pissed people off up north."

"This. 

Ignorance and stupidity are two very different things. Ignorance, at its very core, is a simple lack of knowledge. It is an innate characteristic of every human being that is easily fixed by exposure to new information. We are all ignorant of something. Stupidity, on the other hand, is a sort of willful ignorance. It is a refusal to be exposed to, or attempt to understand, new information. Stupidity often arises out of a fear of new information that may contradict our present beliefs, causing conflict within ourselves. 

Ignorance is exactly what OP described. He held an opinion, was exposed to new information, and changed his opinion as a result. Stupidity would have been to continue to hold his old opinion despite the new information. OP *was* ignorant, but he is most certainly not stupid."

If you do this, you are putting yourself totally at their mercy. They cannot detain you against your will without a warrant or probable cause. Getting you to come to them is their way of getting around that. 

He did so alone. There are people who will tell you to *never* talk with a police officer without a lawyer present. I wouldn’t go that far, but if you’re going to be questioned by law enforcement, you’re making a grave mistake by not making sure your rights are protected."

He woke up the next morning thinking she'd be pissed but she had made him breakfast, done all the chores and told him that he was sweet and then screwed his brains out. 

He was thoroughly confused so he asked one of his kids what happened last night and they told him that she got him home and when she tried to undress him to get him washed up from puking on himself, he fought her off saying ""no! Don't touch me! I'm married!"" It was only after he passed out that she could finish washing him up."

"Commenting this under the highest voted comment so everyone can see, I used to use rub on deodorant and my pits would sweat so much that it would permanently stain shirts after a couple wears. I switched to spray on deodorant and this problem immediately stopped.

So if anyone thinks they have hyperhidrosis, please try switching to spray on deodorant before taking any extreme measures to stop excessive sweating."

"All I can say is that a little fantasy is completely normal.

Since you've been with your wife have you never jerked it thinking about someone else you know? Have you ever thought of someone else while fucking her?

The only difference is it was private and in your head. If you trusted your wife before this, the best advice I'd give is apologize for it getting weird, tell her you trust her and can't wait to see her, and leave it be. That doesn't mean you will forget about it, and might not have full trust even in that moment, but it's a helpful white lie.

Think about it, if you get crazy on her you literally can't help the situation, and might literally push her into something stupid. If you stay reasonable, she would either cheat or she won't, but be more likely to remember the good side of your marriage if you're acting like a stable human.

Freaking out on her leaves only a lose/lose situation. 

Staying reasonable, even if she were 50/50 on cheating (which doesn't sound realistic) has a very real possibility of keeping things good between you."
