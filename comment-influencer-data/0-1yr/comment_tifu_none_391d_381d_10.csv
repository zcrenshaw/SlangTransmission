You can't handle alcohol. Full stop.
"Hoooo fuck, this is one of the most sickening fuck ups ever."
I like how your tldr is about the same as your title lol
I'm so confused. So were you using the vacuum just because of the shape and not for suction? Seems like hard plastic wouldn't be very comfortable.
Why didn‚Äôt you just make margaritas or tequila sunrises ? A much easier way to mask the taste of a bad tequila. 
sounds like your fuckup has less to do with scoring weed and more to do with having a few too many drinks.

"Good luck! My sister had something like that happen. But it was her eye! She kept feeling like she had something in her eye for months. Then it changed to pain. I can‚Äôt remember if she went to a regular doctor or a specialist. Whichever it was, they were looking at her eye while having her look in different directions. Then the doctor saw the end of a strand of hair. He was able to grab it and gently started to pull. The hair had wrapped around her eyeball multiple times! After he pulled a few inches out the nurse had to leave the room. It grossed her out so much she felt sick. The hair was over 8 inches long. "
"My dad was ex-military and my mom told us we were not allowed to wake him up when he slept. My mom told me when i was 3-4 i went in there room and tried to shake his arm. 

Got picked up and thrown into a wall.

Now he's older and fatter but we still yell at him from the door to wake him.

Edit: to add, as to his service branch, I'm not sure which one. If he was deployed? I do not know. We were young and never asked questions and we never thought of asking as adults. What I DO know is that when there was a big spat between the Bloods and the Crips he was sent to L.A. He's in his 50s now."
Technically it isn‚Äôt their money. There was a banking error and they have a duty to correct that.

You should google the routing number, find out which bank and then check to see if you didn‚Äôt happen to have actually opened a different account. Second you should also talk to DFAS to see if those payments went through cause all that money could just be at DFAS cause the account info was not valid. I would be very surprised if you happened to just mistakenly come up with a valid routing and account number. A little leg work here will probably pay off."

My face and torso didn't get scalded too much, so the majority of the burns were on my back and legs. The blisters that resulted were crazy, and the stinging from applying the ointment to my open blisters were just.. Something like hydrogen peroxide eating your skin continuously. I'm so glad that there isn't much scarring left now. My mom was quite religious in applying the ointment despite my being in pain. Thank goodness for that.

"While that is true, the other person who did get the money also had a responsibility to report that they received money that wasn‚Äôt theirs to take but didn‚Äôt and since this is the bank it took place at then they are the ones who must deal with it. It was a mistake that should still be corrected and they are required to do so. If they think this doesn‚Äôt happen to people every once in a while they‚Äôre rather naive and the bank corrects the balances on the accounts and that‚Äôs the end of it once it‚Äôs reported by the rightful owner of the funds. You don‚Äôt just lose the money to some random person. They‚Äôre even insured if they would stand to lose money over it."

"I got arrested for a failure to appear in court once. I had a court date the day after my brother died unexpectedly, and missed it. It was for a traffic ticket, so nothing serious.

Cops came and got me at home. They were super nice the whole time. Telling me Oh you'll be home for dinner, don't worry. This is not a big deal. So I wasn't worried. I had already done this once before, since I had an FTA once before due to a paperwork error. Huge snowstorm hit my town, basically shutting it down, my court date was rescheduled, but somehow it got entered in the system I had missed it. So I was taken to jail once for that, but really was home in time for dinner that time.

So I get to booking. I'm told since I already have an FTA on my record, I can't be released on pretrial, which is basically like released on your own recognises, and bail is $1k. My husband and I decide it's not worth it to pay that huge amount of money, I'll have court the next day and be released, I can spend the night in jail. 

So I have court the next day. I spend hours in a tiny little room with at some points 15 other girls, sometimes less. Every one has been taken at some point to see their lawyer or whatever. Finally it's my turn to see mine, she's a public defender who is positive I'll be going home that night. She takes me to a court room with Every one else and I wait for the judge to call my name. And wait. And wait. She never called my name. My public defender didn't even notice. I had to bring it to the judge's attention, and my lawyer is just like oh yeah sorry that's my client, is she not on the docket? Whoops lol sorry. Even the judge is like wtf lady? So...do you wanna petition to have her put on my docket...? I start saying yes, yes please do that!! Public defender is unfazed. She took my to the wrong judge, so I missed my actual judge and chance to go home. I was pissed. This public defender is just like welp sorry, my bad lol!! Like bitch no, this is my life. You get to go home. I have to go back to jail.

I ended up going back to court every day for three days, with absolutely nothing happening the first two days, no one at all talking to me, just sitting in the same room for hours. On the third day, I finally get called by a new public defender who was just awesome. He was very nice and very apologetic and assured me he would get me out that day. He told me that other public defender was completely out of line and unprofessional, and I could seriously sue the state for wrongful imprisonment and lost wages and shit. I didn't, too much hassle, I just wanted to go home. He got me taken care of and set to be released that night and I seriously cried. Four days in jail with no idea how or when you're getting out, being completely helpless to do anything, and no one giving a shit that you're stuck there is the worst feeling I've ever had. My mom and husband were on the outside trying desperately to figure something out for me, with no luck. My mom was set to meet with a lawyer the day after I finally got out, but damn. It was a nightmare.

Edit, my phone bootlooped on me and I was out a phone for the weekend waiting on my replacement, so I missed all the responses. But I'm in Nashville, and here, an FTA means you get picked up and taken to booking  where you're usually released that same day. That's how it went the first time, but the second, nope. And the way I understood it, my bail was $10k, so a bond was $1k, and I wouldn't have gotten that back. I was under the impression I would be released soon enough, so it just wasn't financially viable for us at the time."
"My boyfriend is a combat vet and when he went in for surgery recently we warned the entire surgery team to stay by his feet when he is coming out of anesthesia because he will wake up in ‚Äòmarine mode.‚Äô The same anesthesiologist that was helping him was the same one that helped him last time and she confirmed. All the staff but one introduced themselves before hand and had a little chat so he knew their faces. 

After surgery one of the assistants rushed down the hall to get me and asked me to come help them. I walk in the room and he has this terrible expression I hope to never see again. He was in total kill mode, trying to pull his leads off and nearly hitting anyone that came near. Apparently he had already grabbed and hurt the one person who hadn‚Äôt introduced herself before hand. I didn‚Äôt know him while he was active so having me there helped bring him back to reality. 

We spent about 30 minutes of him seeing me on his left, talking to him, reminding him he was home, then he would see the person next to me and say something from their earlier conversation, go around the bed repeating this (there were 6 people there) and then you could watch him space out a little and then get the face again. His whole body would tense up, he would start pulling on things again until I yelled to get his attention again and make him look at my face again. He had wanted me to record him but it was so intense I didn‚Äôt even think about pulling my phone out. 

The only other thing to make him stop was yelling his last name, with authority. One of the nurses did this and he quickly responded with ‚ÄúYes Ma‚Äôam‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ well it sure was something. We were having a great time. He was charming and sweet. We were here at the house and he said he needed to use the restroom.

‚ÄúHe was half naked, squatting like some possessed duckling, with his fingers literally **in** his ass and he just shat right on my new white rug‚Äù

"Email to UF professor that kicked you from the class. 

Subject: [Class section, if applicable] Thank you. 

Dear Professor Floo-Flah,

I would like to sincerely thank you for contributing to the best day of my life. So far, I‚Äôve been kicked from my gym, kicked by Nature, kicked by my scooter, flipped off by my parents, flipped off by my electrical outlet, flipped off by a leather jacket, backstabbed by third party mother fuckers, kneed in the balls by Reddit and YouTube, and finally kneed in the balls by your recent email kicking me from your class. 

Please note, the above is not professionally drafted and at this point, I just don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Further, I have completed all my assignments on a timely manner, and without discussing anything with me prior, you assumed I was lying and kicked me from an already over/filled class. In fact, I was on campus, cutting my trip short, because I recalled you wanted an assignment to be completed and my computer was no longer working. But thank you for assuming the worst and using it as an excuse to weed out a student from your class. I didn‚Äôt think there was reasonable necessity to contact you informing that I had cut my trip short, assuming you would have seen me in class the following day.

Anyhow, I figure getting through a fuckhead like you is impossible so go on ahead, be a little bitch, and try to get me suspended or expelled because you think I‚Äôm going to come after you or some fucking ridiculous, overreacting shit. 


Yours sincerely,

OP.

That sucks. A good employer would have been sympathetic.
"Luckily, I have some experience cleaning blood out of things, so I‚Äôm hoping he reaches back out to me so I can at least point him in the right direction. He was so nice about the whole thing, and I was very much embarrassed. He definitely got a 5 star review from me.I also sent a letter to
Uber about the whole thing as well to be upfront about paying the guy for the damages and to commend him for dealing with my dumb ass. He was seriously wonderful. "

If you look at the very bottom right you'll see a large number ($3.7million) that's in green, but bounded by parentheses. The parentheses means it is a negative number, and that number is his profit and loss to date for the year: - $3.7 million. "

Why would you morons choose to smoke like in or around the house? Sounds to me like you had an entire beach.

That happened to me my first time. The trick is to wait 2 hours...not 30 minutes. Also to start off with 5-10mg until you're comfortable. I'm an everyday edible user and I take 5-10mg to go to bed at night. I did 20mg my first time and thought I was time traveling. 
"I'm a man and I can confirm this can happen to men too. After some fun times I ended up with one of my wife's long hairs wrapped around the head of my snake, under his... scarf, if you will. The problem is although it was uncomfortable, just like op I just shook it off (unfortunately not literally) and went to sleep.

When I woke up in the morning, it was super uncomfortable. I jumped in the shower, and then very gingerly, because at this point it felt like my fun wand had a snare tied around it, I unsheathed my weapon to discover a hair tied very tightly at just about the widest part of my racing helmet.

It looked as though it should be bleeding it was so tight, like a hero garroted by a villain. 

Unfortunately to add insult to cock injury, it didn't want to come off. Because it had worked it's self so tight, it had created it's very own trench in my no man's land.

Eventually I went nuclear and just did a squeeze and roll and off it popped like an elastic band.

Took about 2 days for the cock ring it had left me with to fade"
