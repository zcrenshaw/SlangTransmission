"I'm (f) the exact same way!!! I have attractive friends, and in other circumstances I may be attracted to them but there is a wall and friends or horny feelings do not cross this wall. I have no sexual feelings towards friends or friends' SOs.  It just doesn't happen. And I'm def into both sexes. One of my female friends wanted to get it on and it was a biiiiiig nope. She's sexy and cute as hell but friend-zoned - it will never happen between us. Almost like friends get put in the same category as family in my brain."

"Its like at my last job, I had to drive a diesel truck. I told my boss that I wasn't a car guy and knew nothing about diesels. I was told that was fine. Every time I didn't know something they got mad at me. For example, they told me to get DEF to put in the trucks. I told them I didn't know what that was and I was mocked for not knowing that. I had never been around diesels at all before this, I told them that, yet somehow I was expected to be mechanic because I guess car people can't fathom that not everyone else is a car person."
"It was the same for me, about a year to work up the courage- I think she knew things weren’t going well but she def didn’t expect it.  I felt guilty for a long time but it was for the best for both of us."
