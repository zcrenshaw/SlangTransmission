"He likes to call me different nicknames, one of them being ‚Äúpeach.‚Äù So, whenever he wants to cuddle, he says ‚Äúpeach time?‚Äù and we cuddle and just lay there together. It‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite things in the world.  "
"guy: wyd

girl: my aunt just died so i'm kinda sad

guy: oh sucks. what would u do if i was there? ;) ;)

Not everyone you meet has to like you and that's ok.
"I scratch his back and head. He was telling me how his mom would scratch his back and it is a very intimate thing for him. His grandma would scratch his head until he fell asleep. 

Ever since he told me that, I‚Äôve been trying my best to stay awake long enough that he falls asleep from head scratches too, as he has trouble falling asleep. Last night I finally held out long enough. I could hear his breathing change and his body relax and felt him fall asleep under my hand and I don‚Äôt know why, but I was the happiest in the world because I could do something for him like that - someone I really care about. He told me I was amazing and I just melted. I hope to do it more often. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied! Many of these responses brought a smile to my face and I wish I could respond to everyone. It makes me so happy to see that others enjoy this feeling as well, be it delivered through giving scritches, or receiving üòÜ I hope those who wish for this kind of affection have it one day. "
"Literally sleeping together. That‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve done with another person for a VERY long time. 
Cuddling and eventually falling asleep in someone‚Äôs arms is very intimate and requires quite a bit of vulnerability "
"Him: let‚Äôs play 20 questions. 

Me: Sure, what‚Äôs your favourite colour?

Him: black, so are you a virgin? 

"
"I dunno if this counts but I got my husband through his fight with Hodgkin's Lyphoma and his relapse a year later.  It was just him and me, we have a small support system and none of them live locally.

The relapse meant a bone marrow transplant. Shit. Is. No. Joke. Literally brings you to the brink of death and back. 

My husband is a 6 foot strong scottish man and when we were in the thick of it I had to push him in a wheelchair at the hospital cause getting from the car to the door was all he could do. 
He looked nothing like himself either, hairless, pale.  I was bathing, dressing, feeding him, managing his many medications (and the side effects -violent vommiting)  and getting him to and from the hospital on a daily basis. 

I have a very clear memory of helping him get into new pj's one morning and thinking ""I knew I might have to care for him like this....but I also thought it would be in my 70's, not at the ripe old age of 34...."" 

Being a caregiver for your loved one in and of itself is a crazy intimate experience, you see someone at their absolute worst/weakest and somehow you find new strenght in yourself at the same time.  

That ordeal changed us, obviously.  We definitely have had a new level of intamicy since.  It's bonded us in a way that I can't put into words.  

EDIT: Wow. I am truly humbled folks. I wasn't even sure if this thought belonged here and your comments have brought me to tears. Thank you so much. I replied where I could, I definitely felt all the love. 

*My husband has been cancer free for 4 years this past September*. It took a long time for him to shake the side effects from all the chemo but as of earlier this year we really feel like we've moved forward and left that battle behind us. 

For all of you fighting the good fight or supporting somone who is - we got our happy ending and I wish that so hard for all of you.  Stay strong. 

And GOLD, well shit. My first (and second, and third!) ever! Thank you kind people, I am moved. "
Always pee after sex.
"My boyfriend swims nearly everyday and the chlorine dries the crap out of his skin, so I spend a few minutes everyday lotioning his back and ass so they don‚Äôt get ashy. 

This is mostly non-sexual but sometimes I pretend i‚Äôm a dude and the lotion is my ‚Äúnut‚Äù, with crazy humping and dirty talk. He doesn‚Äôt like it when the turntables."
"That we can, but choose not to, hold our periods like we hold our pee. "
"I'm a lot more affectionate and hand holdy than he is. I also grew up in a household where we were encouraged to say I love you whenever we felt it. Because he doesnt display Hallmark Card romance sometimes it feels like he doesnt love me as much as I love him....until I look over and realize that for the past 6 hours he has been researching the best insulated pants to keep me warm while camping because I was cold last time. Because if that ain't love, I dont know what is. "
"When he wraps himself around me tightly while cuddling/spooning, and calls it ‚Äúmaximum security‚Äù

If I‚Äôm feeling sad, he‚Äôll tease me and be like ‚ÄúAw does someone need maximum security?‚Äù It‚Äôs very sweet"
"Waking up to his ""thinking of you"" dick pic text, sent at 2 A.M."
Being alone and being lonely are not the same thing. Don't let people make you feel as though you're some sort of desperate spinster just because you're spending time learning to love yourself.
You're just going full Boyle here.
I love this thread and it makes me feel so lonely.
"""Is anyone going to notice...""  The answer is probably not.  Your hair have a little cowlick? Eyelashes have a weird gap? Clothes not fitting okay or just feeling like crap?  Don't worry about it.  Play it off until it goes away or fix it.  Usually being self-conscious about something is more apparent than whatever you're self conscious about. "
"My boyfriend draws and sometimes he draws me naked. Granted it's a prelude to sex some times but not all the time. It's super intimate, watching him quietly concentrate and do his work while sort of examining parts of me.

I used to be super self conscious, so just laying there and being out in the open is sort of freeing and idk. Just feels close."
[deleted]
"He plays love songs on the piano while I stand behind him kissing the back of his head. I almost cry sometimes.

He's autistic and doesn't do verbal affection, but he finds ways to show me that he loves me."
"Hey you have received great advice from fellow mums, but one thing that I would like to say to you is, please please have a baby with the right person. 

My husband is great, he supported and looked after me through both pregnancies. He was my rock and stood by me through 2 tough labours. And when the babies arrived he took 4 weeks off and looked after the babies while I was recovering. We bottle fed, so he was able to do the night feeds while I slept and I did the morning feeds while he slept. He‚Äôs a great dad who would do anything for his kids. 

I know way too many women who didn‚Äôt have a great support system at home and the baby ended up being totally mum‚Äôs responsibility. 

All the best, I think deep down you‚Äôre ready for a baby already. "
I pluck my husband's eyebrows. He's really insecure with how his eyebrows look and he trusts me enough to style them for him. 
You can leave any situation if you feel uncomfortable.
"Anytime you say you‚Äôre doing something, they reply with ‚Äúwithout me? üòè‚Äù. "
"My boyfriend is a big guy with a lot of confidence, so it‚Äôs very adorable when he snuggles up to me like he‚Äôs teeny tiny. I‚Äôm also the big spoon 100% of the time. He can never know I posted this lol

Edit: I told him because of all the unexpected upvotes, I thought this would be buried "
"My ex-stepbrother. All his Instagram pics are of him fresh out of the shower, towel wrapped low to show off the ‚Äúdeep V‚Äù, dirty bathroom mirror selfie with steam. He captions every pic with some rap lyrics. Lots of duck faces, painfully obvious smizing, a lot of them with his hand on his chin in the ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù pose with his index finger pointed up. 

He‚Äôs 21 and dates girls from the Highschool I teach at. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"An overabundance of compliments and not a whiff of normal conversation to be found. 

Sad stories about his heartbreak or anything to garner sympathy for him. Generally very dramatic.

Any conversation steers towards the physical/sexual. ""Innocent"" comments and questions, hints mixed into what appears to be normal conversation but actually isn't.

When you receive a flirty Snapchat that you know was sent out to 100 different girls. 
"That having a period is like peeing.  You sit on the toilet, squeeze it all out and get on with your life until next month."
"The way it fits. Not too loose and not too tight. For shirts specifically if it forms around his muscular biceps, that‚Äôs attractive af."
"I think the most intimate thing happened during my second son‚Äôs birth a few months ago. I had given birth quickly and easily, but then began hemmoraging. They stood me up to go to the bathroom and blood began pooling down my legs and feet. Immediately back in bed, giving me shots and meds to try to stop it but it wouldn‚Äôt. The nurses were scared and a team ran in. My husband laid the baby down and held my hand- I was terrified I was dying and leaving them. I just kept looking into his eyes and telling him I was so scared, and he stayed calm and smiled and reassured me. I‚Äôm so lucky- they found a piece of retained placenta and were able to give me a second epidural and manually remove it. But I ended up losing almost 800 ml of blood. I really thought those could be my last moments, and I just locked eyes with him, trying to communicate everything I needed him to know about our family and my sons- but too scared to say any of it outloud. It was the most intimate moment of my life. "
Crying and trusting my partner with my emotions and scary thoughts. 
"That sex is supposed to hurt no matter what. Oh. And that you die if you shower on your period. BTW, tampons take away your virginity. And shaving your pubes hurts your ovaries.

Source: my mum."
It's okay to say no. You can say no to whatever you want and you don't owe anyone anything.
You don't have to be a parent. It's not selfish or rude. 
"They are more concerned with my underwear than I am on any given day. 

‚ÄúWhatchu wearing babe ;)‚Äù

‚ÄúUh a ratchet sports bra from when I was 15 and some granny panties because I‚Äôm on my period and don‚Äôt want to ruin the good stuff‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn girl lemme see ;)‚Äù"
"I don't because I like to have a fresh tampon after showering.  There's nothing wrong with leaving it in or anything, but I irrationally feel like I'm only getting half clean if I leave the same tampon in while showering.  "
That drinking cold water during our period will chill the blood and make the flow chunky. ... Just no.
Taking care of me when I was sick. We‚Äôve been together for about a year and don‚Äôt live together. I had to cancel plans because I had the stomach bug (diarrhea and throwing up) and he came over and took care of me. Any man that can witness his girl sitting on the toilet and head in a trash can and still want to cuddle you and love on you is a keeper. 
"As someone who too often chose to stay home in bed, I told myself at the beginning of the year, anytime someone asks you to hang out (unless it interferes with school or work) say yes. And I did, the entire year. And although it was exhausting at times I have never built stronger bonds with people or made better memories. Highly recommend."
"Diversify your sources of self-esteem. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"This. I‚Äôve broken down and cried in the freezer section of a grocery store before when I was really stressed out and worn thin. He just unzipped his jacket and and hugged me and zipped it around me and just let me break down where I felt hidden. He also glared at anyone who gave us dirty looks. He let me get it out and then we finished our shopping and he bought me a candy bar. The best part was that he never made me feel bad about it in the slightest or even let on if he was embarrassed by it. He just treated it as if it could happen to anyone and he understood I needed a cry.

The fact that he never judges me for crying when I get stressed or frustrated or even for no reason at all is one of the things that makes me love him so deeply. He‚Äôs a very guarded crier, like only in our room with the door shut and in my arms in silence where no one can see us. I am glad that he trusts me enough to let me see him that way and to open up when he needs help.

Edit: he‚Äôs not perfect, he quotes Family Guy like all the time"
"I had a dude ask me ‚Äúif I ever put in a tampon just for fun‚Äù

You're importance and validity as a human is not equated to the amount of interest men give you.
"- Fits well (I personally think men in skinny jeans is usually unattractive but not super loose either. Fitted. Relaxed jeans are fine to me but dress pants generally fit a bit snugger)

- Good posture

- Clean 

- Smells nice

- Dressed appropriately for the occasion

- for some reason I find it incredibly attractive when men play with their belts, like pull on it a bit. Fiddle with the side. Just me? Ok.  I find my husband taking it off incredibly attractive but ummm this might jut be me and leave your clothes on in public as a general rule "
Getting dressed for the day or undressed for bed together. Having deep meaningful conversations on the couch. He scrubs my back before I get in the shower.  I shave his lower back for him after a health issue necessitated it. 
"Talk. Just literally open my mouth and let the most random, uncensored, stream-of-consciousness shit pour out, often times working through things or saying things out loud to process them, and I never (ok, rarely...) feel like I'm being judged. I don't recall a time in my life that felt so comfortable and safe and loved in a relationship. That level of trust translates to so many other aspects of a relationship and it is both scary and exhilarating."
"That having sex with multiple partners wears a woman's vagina out.  
That having hanging labia is proof that a woman has had a lot of 'slutty' sex.  
That it is easy and totally easy to deal with birth control, and women can get sterilized with no trouble whatsoever."
"Oh, how the turn tables"
"That we look at a guy and immediately put them in the ""fuck"" zone or the ""friend"" zone and then that's it, never shall we change our opinion at any time sorry my dude, you have been filed into the friend category and as such I shall never ever ever have the urge to fuck you better luck with the next gal"

"I have literally put my son to sleep watching him completely relax and then  pass out while I rub his head and have thought, "" I hope you find a woman that will do this for you someday."" I just never want him to be without that tenderness.  And your comment just made my life! 

Edit: fixed the word tenderness and thank you for the gold kind stranger. Made my night! "
"* Only ever seems to contact you after 11 PM your time, and it's not like he works the night shift or something. 

* Requests or outright demands nudes, even though you just met. Bonus points if he sends a dick pic. 

* Tries to cyber right away.

* Whines about using a condom. 

* Tries to pressure or guilt you into sex or a particular kind of sex. 

* Admits he has a wife/girlfriend/fiancee, but that he's not happy with her. (Which he clearly isn't, if he's trolling for side chicks.) Promises you that he'll leave her for you one day, and yadda yadda yadda.

* Ghosts you after sex.

* Doesn't seem to want to do anything but make out or have sex when you're together. 

* He's clearly gotten all his sex ed from porn, and he doesn't pay attention to your needs. Foreplay? What's that? 

* Won't go down on you because ""it's icky,"" but absolutely insists that you blow him. 

* Judges women/girls on the basis of ""good girl"" and ""whore."" Expects to marry a virgin someday, or at least someone whose ""lucky number"" isn't that high...but has had numerous partners himself. 

* If you don't have sex within the first two or three dates, he loses interest. 

* Tries to ""neg"" or ""should"" you into conforming to his turn-ons and preferences, lots of back-handed ""compliments"" even though he doesn't know you well or at all. 

* Strings you along with promises he doesn't keep, and doesn't intend to.

* Has no interest in meeting your friends and family. And doesn't introduce you to his. (As Chris Rock puts it, ""If you've been dating a man for four months, and you haven't met *any* of his friends, *you are NOT his girlfriend!*"") 

* Only ever seems to contact you when he's horny. 

* Seems averse to commitment. And when you bring up the future, or ask how he feels about being exclusive/marriage/kids/etc., he waffles, or changes the subject.

"I‚Äôve heard several men say if they were women, they would be prostitutes because it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy money.‚Äù And then I remind them they don‚Äôt need to be a woman to do that because lots of men pay good money to have sex with other men. Suddenly, they‚Äôre way too dignified for that. "

"Here‚Äôs the most depressing one I‚Äôve heard:

My doctor assumed I wouldn‚Äôt care about having sex. 

I suffered severe radiation burns and a rupture in my vagina during cancer treatment. My use of a dilator was going to be delayed, allowing scar tissue to shrink my vagina and prevent PIV intercourse. When I wouldn‚Äôt stop pestering him about options to use a dilator or have SOMETHING done to help he had this dawn of realization and says ‚ÄúOh yeah, I guess you‚Äôre not 80, you probably still need to have an active sex life‚Äù

Also wtf man, what if I was 80? Just because women are older doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt want sex as well!

He‚Äôs a damned gynecological oncologist and DIDNT EVEN THINK about preserving my sexual function!!


Edited to add: I‚Äôm yet another woman in the **90%** of patients that suffer sexual dysfunction following gynecologic cancer treatment. Which is TWICE as high as men."
"He goes to bed much later than I do, but he puts me to bed every night. I lay my head on his chest and play with his beard while he rubs my head. Then I will usually tell him, ""I need some skin,"" and I will untuck his shirt, and put my hand up inside under his shirt and rub his chest/play with his chest hair as he rubs my head, until I fall asleep. It is my favorite time of the day, by far! "

Me: yes

Her: I see.. (another sad look in my direction) well then who are you supposed to leave funds to if anything happens to you?


I felt so judged and shitty by the interaction, I have a great career, hobbies, family and friends but she made me feel like a loser or something. We all have and want different things in life, and that's okay. I'm not going to run out and change my life to please the rest of society and certainly don't need to feel bad about it.

I'm not really sure why a lot of American guys tend to gravitate towards baggy or ill fitting clothing. Maybe I guess because it's not considered stereo-typically masculine to care too much about your clothes. "

"Not me, but my mom. She grew up being emotionally and physically abused, which led her to marry young to a guy who emotionally and physically abused her. They were only married a year or two. Less than a year after leaving her ex, she got pregnant with my brother and married my dad who was also emotionally abusive and a cheater. They were married 20+ years and separated about 6 or 7 years ago. She became super depressed and was an alcoholic for a few years. About 3 years ago, she hit rock bottom and then never had a drink since. Since then, she has worked on herself emotionally and spiritually. One day, a little over a year ago, she was in 7/11 picking up a few things and she randomly met her current boyfriend. She‚Äôs 54, he‚Äôs either 46 or 47. He treats her with such respect and love. They‚Äôre truly best friends. Makes my heart so happy!"
"I decided to change my identity as the frazzled, messy, disorganised person. I have pretty intense depression and anxiety and one week I got my house cleaned and all my lessons planned (I‚Äôm an English teacher.) I did it on autopilot and didn‚Äôt think much of it. I realised how great this made me feel and I continued this for a few weeks.

A week later I went to my therapist and she was basically like, ‚Äúit sounds like you haven‚Äôt been disorganised or messy this past while. How would you feel about deciding that you aren‚Äôt that person anymore?‚Äù And I did. I literally just did. 

It has done true wonders to my mental health. I don‚Äôt have to constantly worry about having people round to my flat, whether or not I‚Äôve marked my books, or apologising for being late. This may sound stupid and unimportant but I can‚Äôt stress how much this has improved my opinion of myself. 

I‚Äôm off to clean the oven now! What is life? "

"love waxes and wanes. as long as your partner is invested and treats you right it's okay imo. not everyone shows love the same way tho, you might not know their love language so you might not be recognizing how they show their love for you and/or your partner may need to learn your love language and do more of those things so that you feel loved. have a talk about it before you decide anything, communication is #1 and most issues can be improved after a conversation."

It reminds you of your hometown? You love line dancing? Or maybe not. Why? You hate banjos? You think it‚Äôs a worse version of Mumford and Sons? Having opinions on things are how you have a fun conversation. People telling each other how they think and feel about the world around them. It gives you insight into their inner world and personality."
"So much this. I remember holding my son in the rocking chair and sobbing right along with him bc I was so exhausted and worn out and I‚Äôd kick the bed over and over and call out but his Dad just would not get up and help me. 

You are so lucky to have found an incredible partner. My kids are 12 and 9 now. I‚Äôm a single mom and have accepted that I probably won‚Äôt ever have more children. Now I always fantasize about what you had. Doing things the ‚Äúright‚Äù way with a loving husband that cares and helps me. It‚Äôs only a dream but having that kind of love and support is a game changer. "

"I have felt that in past relationships, although in retrospect it was probably more that I respected them more than they respected me. I would ask how they felt about things and then tried to do stuff they liked, but that was never reciprocated, even though I told them outright that I liked this or this other thing they did made me feel bad (and I made sure to do this in a direct but lighthearted way, not during a fight or other stress). It was like they just assumed I‚Äôd always be there even if they put in zero effort. So I left. 


My current relationship is not like that at all - in fact, I‚Äôm really careful about what I ask for and what I tell him bothers me, because he takes it to heart and I don‚Äôt want to make him concerned over unimportant things. "

And I feel like they‚Äôve been inconsistent with him too and they are creating a stereotype. In my opinion he seems like he‚Äôs supposed to represent someone with Asperger‚Äôs but not everyone with Asperger‚Äôs is a genius or a socially awkward asshole. Maybe I‚Äôm offbase there but I just don‚Äôt like the character, or find him quirky-charming at all."
I remember hearing the sentiment before that having sex with a lot of different men will cause a woman‚Äôs vagina to become loose and unappealing to future partners. Like having sex with 50 men 1 time is different than having sex with 1 man 50 times.

"Andy from Parks and Rec.

People love Andy, but I've dated that type of guy - great guy, heart of gold and all, but that messiness, goofiness, immaturity, lack of responsibility and happy-go-luckiness -  ahhhhhhhhh!

April is his perfect partner, because she doesn't give a fuck, but for people like me who value security, consistency, and normal adult standards (like having clean dishes to eat off of, stable finances (even as a goal) etc.), I would resent the hell out of him as a partner.

It's like - yes, Andy would *die* for you, for most people in fact, because he's a big-hearted puppy dog like that. But would he work day to day in a boring, soul sucking office job while you take on two shifts just so your children have health insurance and a consistent place to live, and then come home at night when you're both exhausted from work and pitch in with cooking, cleaning, and chores? Eh.

The worst part is that he's so goofy and sweet and puppy-eyed and everyone loves him that you can't even get all that mad at him for not pulling his weight without looking like Cruella De Vil because ultimately that's just the way he is, and it's your fault for picking him to be a life partner and expecting him to be any different.

Maybe he reminds me too much of that ex, but yeah, I dislike him strongly."

"That being a woman is ""playing life on easy mode.""

Very attractive women get occasional perks for their attractiveness (of the free drinks/free entry to the club/free dinner variety), but even those typically come with an expectation of reciprocity in the form of love/sex/attention.

"Keeping it real - I had a horrible experience with pregnancy. I was basically sick for 37 weeks straight. I felt like the worst hangover I've ever had except it just...didn't stop. It wasn't fun. 

Birth was actually a very positive experience for me. I had a c-section and it was relatively painless. I mean, I couldn't feel anything except a weird feeling of pressure and by the time we all went home from the hospital I still never really felt any pain. At most the incision area was sore but it wasn't more than a mild annoyance. I credit the incredible doctors and nurses I had at my hospital. 

The baby (or babies in my case - had twins) makes it all worth it in the end. I recommend looking through r/BabyBumps for more stories. One thing I do NOT recommend is watching birthing videos. I did that and it gave me way more anxiety and stress than I needed, but being the kind of person I am I wanted to be super informed. I think there's a point where you can be TOO informed - I could have lived without seeing those. "
"My partner died 10 months ago. Reading this warms my heart. We shared many of the same things you‚Äôre all describing (cuddling, being sick together, being in hospital, being able to say/do the weirdest things without repercussions, sharing our tears, grooming each other).

I think one of my favorite things was that we had a whole little language no one else understood. Little mannerisms and abbreviations and gestures that were only funny or meaningful to us. We could also just tell what the other was thinking after 13 years of knowing each other. I could tell he was thirsty just by the way he looked around the room. We walked into a busy cafe once and he immediately knew I wanted to leave so we could find somewhere quieter. 

My partner was also an Afghanistan veteran. I feel privileged to have loved and supported him through that experience. It was a big part of his life.

I cherish all that. These intimate things are the things your special relationships are made of."
We wrestle and play fight...I know ifs weird but it's so fun. Plus he was an NCAA wrestler and has his purple belt in BJJ so he can twist me in any knot he wants and it's oddly satisfying to be under his complete control but it's actually not sexual.

"The fuckboy who got me pulled a 180 by saying he was super into me and asked me on a date. Really made me feel like he liked me, then after we had sex, he said he wanted to be friends with benefits. Anytime I hear someone say that now, I know its just a fuckboy.

Edit: Forgot to mention what made it worse was after he pulled this, he started dating another girl, but still wanted me to be his FWB and cheat on her with me. His backstory was that his ex gf cheated on him and it drove him almost to suicide, too."

"Yeah, I'm in a mommy group for women who had babies the same month as me, and the thing that's been a shock is seeing how a HUGE portion of them have husbands who are completely incompetent, lazy, and neglectful. They can still play the role of adorable dad for the social media likes and praise from their families for doing the bare minimum, but behind the scenes they're forcing their wives to do 95% of the work while making no sacrifices of their own. It's a side of the modern family that you don't see a lot of on your sanitized social media.

On a related note: from conception to pregnancy to childbirth and post-partum, a lot of women are neglected and ignored and not believed in medicine. My husband is incredibly polite and mild-mannered, and I told him before the baby was born that he had to be my advocate. That if shit went wrong, I would be lacking in agency, and he would need to step up and make sure I was being taken care of. Fortunately my only complication was that my epidural came dislodged. But he stepped up and made sure the nurses didn't ignore me. My issue was just a matter of comfort, but women die every week from very real complications of pregnancy and childbirth that are ignored and minimized. Your partner has to listen to you and be willing to step up to advocate for you."

"I think this one is closely connected to ""women can get laid any time they want, if I were a woman I would have a one night stand every night!"". But what they have in mind is sex = pleasure = orgasm, always.

There was this study on the perceptions of casual sex by men and women, and one of the things that struck me was the meaning of"" bad sex"". For men, bad sex often meant lack of hygiene or it was boring/too passive. For women, bad sex was more along the lines of discomfort/hurt/having to do degrading things or things they didn't want. So if your only concern with a one night stand is that your partner is dirty or boring, I can totally imagine why you'd still take the risk, because the reward (orgasm) is good. For many women, there's no guarantee that sex leads to an orgasm and then if you also risk getting hurt or being forced into doing things you don't want, you'd be much more cautious! "

"I had a pretty textbook boring pregnancy to be honest. The first trimester sucked a little. I 14+ hours of sleep just wasn‚Äôt enough and I can never look at bananas or chilli again since this is what made me sick. 

After first trimester it was smooth sailing, besides being heavily pregnant in the summer time. I kept up working out, too. And I think this is what made things a little bit easier for my pregnancy.

As for birth, I‚Äôve always been scared shitless. I now know why no one has ever been able to describe the pain of contractions to me. During them I was such an asshole just trying to breathe through the pain, and after, I would apologize and cry to anyone who was around when I had one haha. I went in with every intention of doing it without anything for pain. Why? I have no fucking clue. I made it to 5 cm and was like get that need in my spine. Right. Now. Best thing I ever did. Slept through contractions. However, baby‚Äôs heartbeat kept dropping throughout labor and I got stuck at 9 cm. Got to the point that if she didn‚Äôt come ASAP, she wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I was rushed in to an emergency c section. And we both came out perfectly healthy.

Oh I‚Äôm sure he still totally believes it.

I'm 33 and I finally went back to school to get my bachelors degree! I had been unhappy for years and felt stuck. Its something I always wanted to accomplish but felt it was never going to happen.

"Divorcing my husband. It was the hardest thing I have experienced in my entire life. But, I was unhappy and lying to us both. He is a great man but we were incompatible. I now feel unapologetically ME."
"Early in the relationship my boyfriend/now husband said he didn't know how to love me as much as I loved him. We would do that back-and-forth ""I love you"", ""Yeah, well I love you MORE!"" and he would end it with ""Yeah, you do"". When we talked about it he felt like he didn't know HOW to love that intensely, but he was definitely interested in knowing if it was possible. So we worked on it. I remained consistent in my support and have told/showed him I love him every single day since. I don't recall when the conversation came back up (maybe 4-5 years in) but he claimed to love me every bit as much as I loved him. It was pretty darned moving. Then, about a year or two ago, he even said that he cares for my well-being over his own - which is a big f'ing deal coming from him. 

I guess imo you have to go with your gut. There were so many things about my SO that I loved from the moment I met him that I was willing to overlook some imperfections, since we've all got em. Of course I wanted to be with someone who was incredibly in love with me and there were times when I wondered if he would ever be a super sentimental guy, but there were a lot of other qualities he had that more than made up for the lack of romantic gestures. We've been together for nearly 10 years and good lord we are not the same people at all as when we met. These days he frequently says things so romantic just because he knows I love a good happy-cry. 10 years ago he would see me cry, happy or sad, and leave the room because he didn't know how to deal. 

I can't advise you on what you should do, but in my experience people are not an ideal mate and then you get married or whatever - it's more about finding someone you feel there's potential for growth in the ways you both want. He didn't change to be more romantic solely for my benefit. We both come from divorced families and so we wanted to know what a good marriage looked and felt like. Our method is less about being perfect and more about open communication and an open mind to try something different when things aren't working. "

J. K. Rowling kept pushing the inadequacy thing, but seemingly forgot to let his character evolve. So, he kinda stayed a shitty little shit."

"Conversely, it could be argued that having your own biological child is selfish and greedy when there are so many children in the world who are going hungry or uneducated. 

Additionally, requiring more resources simply for the continuation of your specific genetic line, which becomes indistinct at less than 1/16th of the genome (meaning your familial gene string is too short to be distinctly identified after 4-5 generations), is also extremely rude and selfish.

Perhaps your mom was jealous of the freedom your aunt chose, and had to justify it somehow, so she pitied the children that were never born for not getting things they weren‚Äôt missing. "

It comes up during conversations about food. Like, a guy at work I don't know well asked me what my favorite foods were. I said I really like BBQ ribs, fries and hamburgers. His response was, ""You have great taste. Your husband must love it when you make them for him."" I've gotten similar comments from other guys about how my boyfriend must love my cooking, how he's so lucky I can cook, how I must enjoy making delicious meals for him.

I'm single.

I do not enjoy cooking.

"I didn‚Äôt have any issues my first pregnancy, so I kept forgetting I was pregnant until about 18 weeks (almost halfway) when I started feeling movements. Those were weird, like an alien moving around in you, but magic because you knew your child was alive in there and you could actually interact with it. I was constantly getting yelled by coworkers for ‚Äòpoking the baby.‚Äô

Childbirth was not fun‚Äîmy first one was kind of other people‚Äôs nightmare. But, I just kept reminding myself it was just something to get through. I was at a hospital and in the hands of good doctors that I trusted.  The second time around was much easier but still not fun.

If you want to have kids and are pretty healthy, pregnancy and childbirth are  worth it IMO. My best friend up until a few years ago hated the idea of something growing in her and giving birth. She‚Äôs since has a kid and is planning on having more. 

The child you have makes it completely worth it. Once you bond with that baby, it‚Äôs like having a puppy x1000. The workload and expense of having a kid is also like a puppy x 1000, lol. 

If you‚Äôd like more details, feel free to ask for more- everyone‚Äôs experience is different, so I didn‚Äôt want to rant too much about mine :).

Bonus: pregnancy is 10 mos period free, and once the 6 weeks of bleeding are over postpartum, if you breastfeed you often have 6ish months more period-free.   "

"Women get rejected and friendzoned. 

Some women get rejected and friendzoned *a lot*.

Some women have extreme difficulties finding a partner.

Some women have never dated well into their 30s or 40s because of difficulties.

A woman who gets rejected or friendzoned a lot doesn't mean she's ugly, fat, doesn't take care of herself, or is crazy.

Any time you go onto a reddit post about difficulties dating, you will *always* see a multitude of posts about how easy women have it, how women *never* get rejected, and so on. If a woman has dating difficulties, it's always her fault. There is something wrong with her and it's usually that she's ugly and/or crazy. "

"I‚Äôve never had kids but have been in the birthing room at the hospital with a family member and this is what I took from it:

- you will be HUNGRY. get a meal in before going to the hospital if you can. You may go 24+ hours without food, so enjoy something beforehand. Otherwise, it‚Äôs all ice chips for quite a while! EDIT: Only eat beforehand if you‚Äôre being induced, NOT if you‚Äôve been experiencing contractions for hours. 
- additionally, post-birth, you will be given a ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù hospital meal once it‚Äôs safe for you to eat again. The ‚Äúbetter‚Äù the hospital the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù the meal. You probably won‚Äôt care what they serve you, you‚Äôll just be happy to eat. 
- get the epidural! Wait until your pain is almost too much. If you wait too long, you won‚Äôt be able to get it, and you‚Äôll very likely regret not having done it sooner. 
- the nurses will offer you a mirror to look into to see the child coming out of you. Some moms find this as encouragement but I think it would make me feel worse lol
- the doctor will likely not be in the room until the baby begins crowning. S/he‚Äôll basically take the baby out, hand your newborn to a nurse, and then the doc will deliver the placenta. 
- you will probably poop while giving birth. This happens to just about every mom. Don‚Äôt be embarrassed. 
- also, don‚Äôt be embarrassed about not being groomed down there. Docs and nurses have seen it all. It‚Äôs also insanely difficult to groom below your belly when it‚Äôs the size of a watermelon. 
- when the doctor checks to see how far dilated you are, they stick their fingers in your vagina. I personally always thought they used some kind of tool to do this, but nope, they use their fingers
- the nurses are incredibly supportive and helpful and encouraging 
- there will be lots of bells and hospital equipment that will make noises. don‚Äôt be alarmed- it‚Äôs super easy for things to get unhooked
- they give you one of those big exercise balls to bounce on- use it! Some women say it‚Äôs helpful and others don‚Äôt, but if nothing else, it‚Äôs a good distraction
- try to relax as much as possible beforehand and even maybe get some sleep after your epidural (if you‚Äôre having a very long labor). You‚Äôll need all the rest you can get for pushing. 
- you push only when you‚Äôre having a contraction. So between contractions, you have some time to breathe, relax, and work up some energy
- when you‚Äôre ready to give birth it apparently feels like you have to take the biggest poop of your life 
- remind yourself that women have been giving birth for thousands of years and you will make it through this! "

Though with that said, all of this on its own would only make me dislike him. But the fact that Hermione ends up settling for him just makes him even worse to me. She deserves better and he should have ended up alone."

"After my Dad died I found a candid, topless black and white photo of my Mom in his possessions. I was shocked and creeped out at first, but then I thought about it. He had been an active photo hobbiest when they first met, but the pic was later maybe 10 years after they got together. This was in the early 70's, I know he'd gotten out of doing much photography by then, and a topless photo of your wife was not something you'd take to the photomat. That meant he developed it himself. So not only did he want to take a picture of his wife at the time but to go through the trouble of developing it himself meant he REALLY wanted that picture. So even though their marriage fell apart later, I see the pic as a literal snapshot of how they felt about each other at that moment and it's actually very heartwarming."

I said that maybe her pelvic floor needed some exercise because *that* muscle can get weaker with pregnancy, but the vagina is what it is. It doesn't get looser unless there is severe trauma. He insisted I'm wrong. (Also I hate the term mansplaining, but for real, you're going to mansplain to me how female genitals work?! You're a cop, not a doctor, fuck off with that shit.)

"Oh god my family home only had a bathtub, no shower, so when I first got my period I was like, ""Well, I guess no baths for me till this is over,"" because I didn't want to bathe in bloody water (I mean, putting it that way, it sounds pretty metal, actually). It was awful, my period also lasted like a week. I found a way around that with a shower-head pretty quickly."
"Lol ez mode. Even attractive women lose loved ones to death, get in accidents, get in debt over student loans, struggle with grades, have anxiety/depression/confidence issues, struggle to find jobs, lose their homes, have break ups, end up in poverty, etc.

"That's weird, i always thought that women had closer friendships because we do stuff that guys don't. Like get each other ready for town or share literally everything that's going on in your life.

Left the US for China right after college, built a great career there and was incredibly independent for four years. Backpacked for a few months. Moved to Toronto, set up a new job, new relationship. 

Then symptoms started to appear, lots of appointments. Turns out I have a rare and awful condition, required pricy neurosurgery to avoid stabbing myself in the brain with my spine, and have been recovering at home while I figure out what to do next. 

It‚Äôs my absolute worst nightmare, and I don‚Äôt know how to get past it. "

""Yeh""

"I have a love hate relationship with Jim Halpert.

&amp;#x200B;

 He comes off so easily likable but if you pay close attention, he consistently exhibits selfish tendencies. Half of the time it seems he's only nice to another character in order to achieve his own gains from them. In other moments he does do the right thing when no one else will.

It's an internal debate I have of whether he's good for the sake of being good or bc its required to get what he wants."

"I met someone who believed that having milk without having a baby was a special feature cows have, which is why we use cows to produce milk. I explained to them that, no, cows don't produce milk unless they get pregnant and have a baby first. And then the baby is taken a way and, if it's a male, killed for food and that's why you don't see milk cows with babys."
"So true! Also that having a tiny baby is easy to take care of.  When my SIL had my baby nephew, she and her SO were house shopping simultaneously.  Her SO was like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs at home all day with the baby doing nothing. I don‚Äôt know why she doesn‚Äôt just pack him up and go look at houses while I‚Äôm at work.‚Äù Cue internal screaming "
Not often do you get to say used to be related. 
"Yes! I was single for literally my entire life until this summer, so for the five or so years leading up to that, I did stuff alone constantly. Went to museums, saw a movie nearly every weekend (early morning weekend matinee prices are the BEST), traveled, read, went to concerts, went to see speakers I was interested in, became politically active/informed. Suddenly you have things to talk about, interesting stories to tell (travel is particularly rife with story telling material because bad travel stories are the best). Bonus: it makes being single feel way less lonely."
The term 'friendzone' was invented for Ross specifically. 
Holy shit I remember being like 14-16 ish and asking my mom to buy me tampons and she replied ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dying to shove anything inside of you.‚Äù And I was/ have always been confused about that. Tampons suck ass usually and I can‚Äôt imagine one ever feeling good ??

In general, a lot of 90‚Äôs tv hasn‚Äôt aged well in terms of the messages it‚Äôs built around.  It‚Äôs hilarious to me how many shows - even female-targeted shows - had writing that was actually pretty disrespectful and belittling to women.

I am 47. Divorced my college sweetheart after 23 yrs 2 years ago. He was a lifelong cheater and was screwing a 24 yr old at his job who worked for him. Also gave me an std. Finally said I'm out..even tho I never thought I could put my 4 boys through divorce. Within a few months of divorce being final I was introduced to someone through mutual friends at a meeting. He had recently been divorced too..also from his college sweetheart of 28 yrs. It was just like magic..we felt an instant connection and I knew instinctively I could trust him even though my trust in men had been so damaged. Fast forward a year and he is the love of my life. He has stood by my side during so many rough moments this year. He treats me with so much love and respect. I have never felt so safe with anyone. And our love affair is so incredibly passionate and intensely physical-the sex is amazing. That is just the icing on the cake. We have so much in common that it's eerie. He is almost like the male version of me. I am more in love than I have ever been and we are waiting for my remaining son to go to college and then we will get married. Counting the days practically. It has been like a fairy tale and now I don't believe I ever even knew what love really was before him. Do NOT give up. And don't settle either!!
"That the female body has a way to prevent pregnancy if it was ‚Äúactually rape.‚Äù This was famously said by a candidate running for the U.S. House of Representatives in Indiana (I‚Äôm blanking on his name). As a tea party candidate, I‚Äôm not sure if he genuinely believes this or was just spewing anything he could think of to prove his point. But it‚Äôs definitely the most absurd myth I‚Äôve ever heard. 

Other than that, I think most myths believed by men are going to seem absurd to women because we‚Äôre coming at it from the position of experience. Example: some men think women have control over their menstrual flow just like urine. They know what‚Äôs its like to urinate but they‚Äôve never experienced a period before so in my opinion, this isn‚Äôt that unreasonable of a conclusion to draw 

Edit: the legitimate rape comment is true but I‚Äôm realizing now I got a lot of the details confused!"

If you lock me in my apartment by myself for a week I'm gonna be the happiest person ever. And Im so grateful for being this way. Im in my 30s and more and more people in my circles who are 40+ are starting to get divorced and its a shit show, my cousin is in intense therapy because his wife left him and he cant stand being alone.

"One of my proudest achievements as a manager was teaching a young woman who worked for me to stop apologizing and start owning her existence. Priscilla was smart, hard working, and tough as nails, but every other word out of her mouth was, ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù I had a gentle talk with her about it (didn‚Äôt want to make her feel singled out or self conscious) and over the next few months, I‚Äôd signal her if a stray ‚Äúsorry‚Äù came out of her mouth. Watching her change and learn that she was just as important as everyone else was great. It was even better seeing her use her newfound agency to stand up to coworkers and customers. And the best was when I got to see her promoted.

And snore.
"Take it out before, get a good scrub around without the bother of a wet string, and pop a fresh one as soon as I get out."
"I agree with what a lot of other people have said about different ways of showing affection.   
BUT I have been in long term relationships where I always felt that I was a little more invested in him than he was. It was just a terrible nagging feeling. The difference was that we constantly fought and I was the one who always ended up apologizing because I was too scared to lose him. When he finally broke up with me it was genuinely the most freeing thing and I felt like I could live for myself for once. That was a few years ago, I'm MUCH happier now in an equal, loving relationship.   
tldr; yes, we express love different ways, but if it feels unequal and they treat you unequally it's not healthy for your self esteem :)

I do this too. I had to explain to him why I sometimes start out saying one thing and do a complete flip by the end of a long run on sentence.  He now remains seated until the ride has come to a full stop. He never does this so. It was super odd to him.

I also think certain personality traits are gendered and society in general treats people differently. For example, men who are independent, decisive, stong-willed, etc. are considered good leaders.

The constant goofiness, messiness and downright incompetence would get tiring. My fianc√© is a funny guy who likes to goof around but he is also responsible, clean and can be serious when needed. He values being an ‚Äúadult‚Äù. I did like the episode where Andy and April go shopping for their new apartment and he tries to be responsible. I wish he would have continued that trend and had him develop more. I think I heard he was just supposed to appear in a few episodes but the audience liked him so much he became a permanent character, so maybe that‚Äôs why."
