0,OMG u/moby323 thank you.  We moved into a new house several months ago. The ceiling fan light in my office works but wasn't bright enough. I've just been ignoring it.  Your post inspired me to see if it was dimmed.  It was in fact dimmed. Much better now.
1,"I'm gonna be honest.... I totally thought this would end in you finding a huge spider's web or rat's nest or a mass of cockroaches or something when you changed your light. I'm glad it wasn't. Your result was a lot more wholesome.

2,I am not a doctor but am sure that guy is definitely looking forward to the dick appointment
3,"My first thought was: too much or not enough?

Bottle use error... That's not what I was expecting. "
4,As a pharmacist this makes me upset that you guys weren't counseled more thoroughly on the medication 
5,"&gt;A week ago, I ordered a dildo that had a suction cup &gt;base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends.

It was considerate of you to match the size of your boyfriend's dildo."
6,"Glad I didn't wait 6 years to figure that one out when we bought a house,  It only took my 5 year old 2 months to tell us what the problem was. "
7,"&gt;I can’t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I’m shit out of luck.

You'd be surprised."
8,"Compilation videos are dangerous.  

I'm honestly surprised that you didn't calculate the risk.  "
9,Holy shit your clit evolved a defense mechanism against an overly demanding masturbatory war lord
10,"If you give a navy mechanic two steel balls and lock him in a rubber room, he will lose one and break the other."
11,I'll never understand people who eat/drink random unknown things from an office refrigerator.
12,I sat at my dining room table under a very dim fan light that I could have sworn used to be brighter a year ago reading your post. I got up and hunted down the fan remote stuck forgotten in a drawer and replaced the batteries. There was not obvious slider for a dimmer but I just held the light button down and what do you know the light got a lot brighter! It is fair to say that your post has brightened my life. Thanks

28,My TWO AND A HALF YEAR OLD received a Nerf sniper rifle for Christmas from his grandparents. And now he says everything needs to be shot. Last night we could see a bug crawling in a light fixture and he asked “shoot gun??” Had to talk down the cold blooded killer to let the bug live and save the light.

46,"Just explain “I get a lot of telemarketer calls and I didn’t recognize the number so I said the same thing I always do, I had forgotten I owed food”. Done. If she was compassionate enough to bring you food, she’ll understand."
47,When I read the title I thought you had burst the vessels providing blood to your eye and gone blind that way so... it could be worse?
48,"You can explain what happened without sounding racist... Telling them the delay in explaining was because you were taken aback by their kindness would be enough to gloss over any hard feelings.  Small family businesses thrive from repeat customers.  To save face by taking your business elsewhere kinda sucks, tbh."
49,As a nurse — an oncology nurse even!!! that was my first exact thought as well! This is so disgusting on the healthcare side.
50,"Okay story time. So about 5ish months ago I was at work (a hospital) and talking to the young attractive nurse about how her baby was doing and so on. And she was saying that her milk production has been ridiculous and she was having to pump all the time and the baby couldn't keep up.


She starts talking about the benefits of breast milk and all that, and then she asks me if I've ever tasted it. I say no, I haven't. ""Do want try it?"" she asks. I was kind of taken off gaurd and froze up and said something like ""uhh sure why not?"" So she wips out a bottle and pours some a little med cup. I drink it, not wanting to all of a sudden get weird about it. It was pretty good actually. Smooth and slightly sweet.


She could tell I was surprised that I liked it. And then she says ""well, if you'd like, I'll make sure you leave with a fresh bottle after shift change."" I'm sure I turned bright red, because she laughed and told me she wouldn't tell anyone. So here is this hot 26 yr old nurse offering me a bottle of her breast milk to enjoy later. And me and my confused boner just sitting there trying to make sense of this ridiculous situation. I ended up accepting her offer. Still to this day, the weirdest co-worker interaction I've had.


TL;DR - Hot nurse co-worker offers me a bottle of her milk. I'm awkward. I ended up accepting the offer. It was delicious. The whole interaction was nuts.
"
51,Why the FUCK wouldn't you clean it up? 
52,She knew something was up. And decided to make it as awkward as possible. That’s what makes a good friend. 
53,I thought it was going to be a fire caused by ignoring a long term electrical problem.
54,"Is that how you youngsters copulate these days? Why, in my day, it was considered polite to warm the the lube up in your hands before applying it (especially on a snow day!). Just shooting it out of the bottle?! Forsooth!"
55,But how did you explain the suddenly missing table?
56,$1.5 million in military money is like what 13 cents civilian?
57,Stupid question: what happened to the actual tampon?? 
58,"Wow. That was wild from start to finish. I personally lost it at ""et tu, clite"""

60,The table belonged in my room. So no big deal.

87,"I can't lock my wife's dog (that thing ain't mine) out of our room because he'll scream and bark, but when he's in the room, he just stares and looks depressed.  It's pretty much a lose/lose situation for freaky time.  It's been 10 years, dog, get over it.  "
88,"This would have been so much better if, after an hour and a half, you let out a deeeeeep moan, said ""Thanks"", stood up off the dildo, and walked out of the room. No other comments. Just alpha dog and leave it, and the marks, on the fucking table."

Sometimes I think, ""I wish I had a vagina instead."" 
Especially when my niece or nephew runs over to give me a hug and I get a headbutt to the nuts. 
Then I remember the whole period thing, and I'm like ""Oh..... maybe not.""

230,"Last year, I ordered an outdoor fan, for hot days outside at the race rack. A few days later, my Amazon box showed up just in time for our next track day. When I opened it... there was a heater in the box. Kind of the opposite of what I wanted. So, I filed a claim. Amazon said... ""we'll reship... and you'll get a message ""if"" we need you to return the incorrect item"". About a week later... my replacement arrives... I open the box... same heater. File another claim and Amazon decides to just give me a refund, because obviously now, the item number online is just wrong and the fan is no longer available. Now I have twice as many heaters that I'll never use (South Florida). I looked up the heater and they retail for almost $100 each. I never got any notice to return them. I even called Amazon and spoke to someone that told me to just keep them or donate them to a charity."
231,"Here’s the good news: It’s actually not a big deal. It *feels* like a big deal. But, hear me out.

You didn’t go looking for porn of your mom. You weren’t excited to find it. It was an accident. A normal accident that could happen to someone, and it’s okay. You’re not a bad person, your mom’s not a bad person. Life just happens, and it’s fine. You never need to mention it again, to anyone.

Here’s the bad news: There’s no guarantee that what I said will make you feel any better.

Grab a few rubber bands and wrap them around the front of the gun and extend them back to wrap around the plunger.  That way, when you fire, they're augmenting the work the internal springs are already doing and you up the velocity of your bullets.  Do it right and you can easily double your range and speed."

253,"Yes, Amazon is rich as fuck.

More likely, with a lot of things shipped, it is calculated that in the long-run, it is more cost effective for Amazon to in a non-trivial amount of cases ship people new things and not ask for the old things back. This means not needing to deal with returns, not dealing with return shipping and sorting of the returned products, not giving the buyer all the additional stress of dealing with the process. It also builds buyer good will and everywhere there are compliments about Amazon's generally customer-friendly attitude for buying things. This keeps buyers more invested in the brand, in Prime, in recommending the service to family and friends, and does more for Amazon in the long-run than penny pinching over every single shipping error or broken/non-functioning item.

With all that said, Amazon is exploitative of their workers in warehouses, has definitely shit the bed with their intermingled stock and the return/replacement process would be less troublesome if it weren't for this, not withstanding all of the other things that they've done. "
