I mean, clearly."
1,what the FUCK did you just write
2,And then get mental help
3,TIFU by reading this.
4,You fucked up but you made your step dad very very happy. Not all is bad
5,"YOU CAN GET A REFUND.

Who told you that you can’t? PlayStation will do a ONE TIME (as in your lifetime) refund for this exact situation. I know because my son did the same thing. He spent ~$400. I contacted PlayStation and it took maybe 30 minutes on the phone to confirm information. I had every cent back within days.

I never had to deal with my bank.

Again, you absolutely CAN get it back."
6,"Go see a doctor, tell him you accidentally ate/swallowed a spider and you think it may have bitten you. It's not that uncommon or implausible."
7,"I bet if she grabbed you between the legs you would have assumed she was checking for cancer, too."
8,"Girl: Your phone is ringing.

Guy: I'LL SUK YA DIK

Girl: \*runs\*"
9,Just show up with a limp and a cane on Monday.
10,"She: ""Open the Gift OP""

OP: ""i don't Think i will"""
11,"It's like a cold war, you both have nukes."
12,"There's bugs outside, can I join you?"
13,Tell them it was in a can of soda or on a banana and you didn't see it. Then delete this fucking thread and mail me something highly flammable and caustic so I can burn my phone and blind myself. I'm going outside. Enough internet for me you glorious hedon.
14,Start calling yourself the “mother of dragons.”
15,You've found the exact point your timeline went wrong
16,"Agree! But I am 31, changing my name sounds painful. Its a wholesome mess up lol"
17,Own it. Make sure she doesnt take the dragon for themselves
18,"He's ok, we don't have a particularly close relationship, but he has been around for 19 of my 31yrs. I'm cool with doing this and keeping my mouth shut because he is so happy about it, i guess."
19,"Definitely hope you're the prettiest crayon, cause you're definitely not the brightest lol"
20,"She dodged a bullet, who doesn't clean out their fridge for 2 fucking years??"
21,"&gt;3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.
  
Thanks OP, reading this made my day"
22,So the coconut dynasty has finally been toppled. Well done OP.
23,"My husband did something similar a couple years ago when he forgot that I had a job interview and I forgot we had a concert to go to that same evening. When I didn't come home from work, he was calling all my close family, friends, hospitals... it was really one of the sweetest things he's ever done."
24,"Just don't change your name. You can say no to that, you're 31 man."
25,"She's a college RA, that's not going to be the worst thing she's seen all year. 

One of my dormmates was caught getting into a gimp suit in the communal bathroom (it's a coed dorm and the RA was also a girl just doing her regular rounds) and apparently she just acted like nothing happened."
26,And nothing really to win.
27,"Can you find people on the r/FortniteBR sub that would Venmo or PayPal you for things they’d like to purchase on the game? You can gift it to them and make some of your money back. 

Maybe offer a small discount to incentivize people to help."
28,"Send him a message and tell him you know he'll be an awesome dad and how much you respect his kindness and hope his kid learns it from him. And apologize for being tactless.

If he's anything like my wife, the depression is whispering in his ear that he's going to be a screw-up as a father, why did they even bother going through the past two years of trying, and many other worse things. A kind word goes a long way."
29,Is he at least a good step dad?
30,Edibles don't work till you talk shit about them tell me not
31,You mean you don't use your condoms for shaving?
32,"When you TIFU so bad, you summon a mod."
33,"He cried about it, I feel so obligated. He’s like a stern non emotional guy"
34,The only winning move is not to play
35,"Once I was at my friend's house in a night of drinking and when everyone started to fall asleep in the bedrooms, I didn't find enough room and fell asleep on the drawing room couch. I had gone the night, drunk, crying about how I'm incapable of finding love. 

Apparently, someone, also drunk, woke up in the middle of the night saw that I was missing, assumed I had jumped out of the window grief-stricken and raised an alarm. Everyone, all drunk, searched for me and then returned to sleep once they couldn't find me and in the morning I was greeted with ""Oh You're alive!""."
36,I've already sent him a message asking if I can come over. This one needs to happen in person. I'm fucking moron. He'll be the best of the best bestest dads since the beginning of dads. I on the other hand need to call my dad and tell him he fucked up somewhere along the way.

40,"Fuck the mod, we need a priest"
41,"Reminds me of a bullet I dodged recently. Similar situation, but instead of getting bigger, this previously-overweight friend was getting slimmer. Just starting a young family. Looking really good, everything under his chin all gone, etc. I came really close to asking him in a public photo comment what his secret was. A few weeks later he died of stomach cancer."
42,"Walk out grab the biggest one look them dead in the eye, say “I’ll be in my bunk” and walk out."
43,Welp. That’s enough reddit for me today
44,"Hate to add more salt to the wound, but this might help you in the future.

If you log into their PS4 and set it as your primary console, all other accounts on that PS4 get granted full complimentary access to all of your games, DLC, and subscriptions. You can then lock down your account with a password, so they can’t log into it."
45,"porn lied again, smh"
46,I think I’m going to toughen up and tell him I’m not really interested in changing my name. Im just to old for that at this point.
47,Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for buster
48,"No matter what you do, don't send her a picture of a condom."
49,"I thought it was going to end with you carrying her over your shoulder and  some person accusing you of kidnapping her, leading to the cops being called or an arrest or something"
50,"Upgrade your bag. Jesus. I'm imagining starting to do the sex and being like ""hold up!"" And then slinging this plastic, tattered bag on top of the covers like a homeless person."
51,"I’ve always wondered how people don’t realize something is a bit off with themself...

...well maybe dad normally sings Christian songs while prancing around with a candle. Lol"
52,"Bug eating guy made my day, on-command fart-man made my hole weak."
53,I hate you so fucking much right now!
54,"To every girl reading this story: We ain't dumb. It's just that sometimes we have a hard time taking hints, especially if we consider you a friend. Don't let us die alone"
55,"Oh yeah by “accident”, we all know you were hoping for a cheeky invite into the shower with her mum! You little devil you"
56,It could have been a different timeline but tbh I am happy the way things are now. It was a difficult period in my life and I am sure I would end up hurting her.
57,Fus Ro Dong
58,Ya this post almost warrants being cross posted to r/wtf because that's what I kept repeating in my head while reading this post. You need insect Jesus OP
59,"UPDATE: 

Swelling and burning went down after about 10 minutes.

Still saw a doctor, I told them that I accidentally ate a spider on a piece of fruit. 

She assessed my mouth and said nothing seems to be wrong and sent me home. She gave me a weird look before I left and now I don't know if she saw a leg in my teeth or something. 

Wtf is my life"
60,"Maybe his last name as a middle name, fulfills the sentiment but doesn’t require all the complexity"
61,how in tf do you consider yourself a heavyweight if you have never tried edibles?? THE EDIBLE MAKES A FOOL OF US ALL
62,"Not a bad idea, I'll look into it and if in not breaking any rules anywhere, it could be an option."
63,"The big 3:

- the coconut post

- the broken arms post

- eating spiders post

Truly will go down in reddit history"
64,"Have you ever played with the game Penumbra? There is a character there that eats spiders, because he's stuck in a cave in Northern Greenland.

The spiders start to grow eventually, and he keeps eating them. 

One day he notices that his tongue has swollen in his mouth, because the spiders he ate are venomous. 

He decides then to cut his tongue out with a penknife. You can even find his tongue in the game. 

Well, you remind me of this character."
65,OP is literally George Costanza
66,"I’d honestly ask the kids parents to help repay you. At least part of it. Or if the kids get an allowance, it should go to you for a while instead."
67,That's actually *exactly* what it's like
68,"Accidental dosages can be dicey. You lucked out. I had a friends mom have to go to the hospital and he had to come clean about the brownie she ate. 

Good luck."
69,That's what the lube's for.
70,"Between this and bug eating guy, it’s been a good week."
71,This.
72,"Yknow this whole experience was almost worth it just to hear that incredible story, so thank you for that"
73,And put 3 fingers in to check his prostate
74,i need r/Eyebleach to erase this post from my mind.
75,This man showed us his penis to prove his TIFU. That’s serious dedication and I approve. Sorry about the healthcare here. I hope you and that schlong recover nicely.
76,"did you occasionally shout bromacho things like ""yea that chick had amazing bazongas!"" to throw your dad off the gay scent?"
77,"I read the title and instantly assumed it was a pet of some sort, maybe a lizard or hamster that you let ferment in a box for 1.5 years."
78,"That's my wife.  I'm currently in tears over this comment,  thank you"
79,"I say contact her and tell her what happened. Explain that while you're happy now, and wish her the best in her marriage, you didn't realize what was in the box and saved it for sentimental reasons. It gives you both closure, and hopefully you both can be adults and laugh about it now."
80,*Girl: *unzips*
81,"\&gt; I did it again. Everyone got a second golden shower.

I died at this 😂"
82,"Sure showed a lot of concern for your safety lmao

""We care about you enough to look for you but not enough to call the emergency services when you go missing and can't be found"""
83,I'd say she dodged a bullet.  Getting serious with a guy who only cleans his fridge every couple of years?  Sketchy...  :)
84,Please accept this poor mans gold 🥇
85,"in 20 years when you introduce your fiance to your mother, you know exactly what will happen"
86,"From now on, I think I’ll refrain from teasing *or * complimenting people."
87,"A lot of people don’t realize they are high on their first time, even when they quite obviously are.

I’ve had this happen with five different friends on separate occasions. Their eyes would be bloodshot, have the munchies, do all sorts of goofy stuff and sometimes even forget how to speak properly; but they’d swear up and down that they don’t feel anything."
88,"I feel this on a spiritual level. Some people will say that this shit was obvious and that you are dumb for not taking advantage of the situation. But for some people, it’s hard to grasp the fact that someone actually *wants* to be with them. Your brain will tell you that it means nothing and that it couldn’t possibly amount to anything. Don’t feel bad OP, it happens to the best of us. Good luck on your next movie date."
89,"if only the girl replied with: “me too, but i dont parade it around”"
90,Oh my god so fucking much
91,"Counterpoint: sometimes we just genuinely are fucking stupid (when it comes to this). My best friend took **three years** to figure out I was into him, and I was...not subtle."
92,RIP OP.  The anal destruction won’t be nearly as bad as the one you had today.
93,"He shouldn't have to ask tbh, all he can say to his brother is that the money is needed and is now unrecoverable."
94,You 100% should have pressed criminal charrges
95,Terrific.
96,I hope your doctor reddits.
97,"Ah yeah, i know that one. Long time gf finally got an allergy panel done at 33 because she's always had skin issues and random reactions. Turns out she's allergic to peanuts, wheat, hazelnuts, sesame, and our front lawn (Bermuda grass) among many other things. 

Worth noting that once she identified all of the allergens and started avoided them, her reactions got much worse when she does encounter them."
98,"Great, you've taught all of Reddit and now we're farting!"
99,Always leave em wanting more. Even if you don't know that's what you're doing
100,"Yeah, my toddler did something similar a while back. Got ahold of dad's controller while he was busy and spent $100 on the deluxe edition of a game. We had it refunded easily, and then we put a PIN on every device in the house.

Customer support didn't give my husband any trouble at all.

I can't imagine that microtransactions in a game would be much different of a hurdle to try and jump. OP needs to contact customer support"
101,"Think about the adoption, and adding the middle name. You won't need to change anything, but if you don't want it lol obv dont go for it"
102,Which crack tasted better? Hers?
103,This is my legacy.
104,I need mental help after reading this
105,Hell I’d even be one of your customers if everything works out pm me :D
106,So...you getting your anus destroyed this weekend or what?
107,I would go rescue my stuff!!!!! That shit isn't cheap!
108,"So what your saying is that you're not going to jail and eight people saw your dong?

I see this as an absolute win."
109,"College dorm life lends itself to awkward situations.  I lived in the suite style dorms my senior year with a good buddy.

He was pushing 400 lbs, but a cool guy and we'd been friends for all 4 years.  He was dating this beautiful girl and I did not know that she was over.  We had a sort of unspoken, if you need something just pop in if the door is open.  That afternoon (AFTERNOON) my buddy had left his door cracked.

So I pop in and say, 'Hey budd.........""  And I was frozen.  In front of my was my buddy, shirt on, no pants of underwear, dick swinging in the wind.  On the floor in front of him was his girlfriend, completely naked.  EXCEPT, she had on a dog collar with a lease attached.  He was holding the lease and he had a cracker in his hand like he was getting ready to give her a treat.

I backed out and just said, ""I'm closing this.""

Not five minutes later, he popped in my room and said, ""Hey man, if you're bored...""  

I was not interested in having a threesome with my buddy and his girlfriend so politely declined, but college breeds some weird stuff."
110,AMA
111,"I cracked up when I read the ""politely declined"" part."
112,"I think you misinterpreted the term ""blowing a load"" lol"
113,thank you! I love information!
114,How much does that scene from lion king get you off?
115,Now go tell your dad you're disappointed that he's doing those shit drugs
116,Delete Reddit. It's over
117,"Meanwhile, I’ll be awaiting the AMA."
118,Don't you people ever lock bathroom doors?
119,"I used to take a yoga class thrice a week after work, at my workplace. My husband forgot that it was one of my yoga days and panicked when i didn't get home by 6pm and i wasn't answering texts or phone calls, so he rushed over and he was pulling into the parking lot just as I was leaving the building, yoga mat in hand. I could see in his face the moment he realized his mistake. It was endearing and aggravating at the same time."
120,Reminds me of the “sharp” cheese post from a little while ago
121,"“No, thanks. I don’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up” 

“Take care now”"
122,One woman. Two cups.
123,Holy shit that was not smart
124,"&gt; Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.

Looks like they're savvy enough to warn you..."
125,Think of it from a dudes perspective. If my homies walk in on me cranking my yank and I stop then I just got caught cranking my yank but if I don't stop then they watched me cranking my yank and now they're the weirdos. You need to own this and make them feel weird for making it a big deal.
126,"This sounds awfully familiar....

Anyway! Sorry that happened to you."
127,"I don’t understand why didn’t op start fucking and then when his gf caught him, she would join in? OP is keeping stuff from us!"
128,Holy crap. That's a whoopsie daisy.
129,"1. Keeping your cum shirt in an easy to grab area.
2. Using a work shirt as your cum shirt.
3. Never washing said cum shirt/getting rid of it to replace it.
I just don't understand some people, not do I want to."
130,Sounds as bad as me jokingly posting a cartoon about death on my friend's FB page and finding out he didn't respond because he had died that week in a motorcycle accident.
131,WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS
132,"if they can't change it in 20 minutes, don't remark on it - that's my rule. They get to live with it, they don't need to be reminded."
133,"I have a personal rule of never commenting on someone’s body unless they ask me to. I’ll compliment their clothes, job, voice, character, but never their body."
134,I wish I had more upvotes lmao
135,More people than we care to know.
136,"Most of this is kinda bad luck in combination with poor judgement (no underwear in tear away pants is kinda not smart) 

However the TEXT you sent is 0% bad luck and 100% on you
Silence wouldve been better"
137,I'm a strong believer in 'pics or it didn't happen'. 'Send nudes' ain't so bad either.
138,I don't buy it.  Who get's a present from someone they're crushing on and doesn't immediately open it.
139,"If it makes you feel better I doubt they gave half a damn what you were buying as long as you weren't a butthole about it. I was a retail employee for almost 10 years and the only time I cared that a guy asked where the condoms were was that time he decided to use it as an opening to flirt with my married, pregnant butt."
140,"Never forget, we all have ""the one that got away"" :) I cherish those memories of her. We always had ""a thing"" but one of us were in couples while the other was not. :) things happen for reasons :)

&amp;#x200B;

Glad you find a silver lining in that. :)  

have a good day friend."
141,"Once you have kids, you start to pull blankets off the bed when you're looking for someone.  You can scream in a kids room and they won't answer until you pull the covers off them and poke them.  

I've misplaced my wife on the couch from time to time too.  My kids always drag blankets out to the couch.  Now I know to get all the blankets on the floor while searching.

Also, check high places.  I lost my dad once in a bunk bed when he was staying at my place.

It seems like no-one wakes up when you yell their name at your highest volume.  But get a fork out of a kitchen drawer and they piss and moan about how you woke them up."
142,Adorable
143,Couldn't you... just tell him? Congrats on the perseverance tho
144,Or if parents actually knocked before entering.
145,hey atleast you weren't eating spiders
146,I wouldn't change your name at this point.  At 31 there are professional implications to changing your name.  I've heard that many women with established reputations don't do it even if they get married.
147,Girl: *unzips further*
148,"I've had a few friends tell me you don't get high your first few times trying pot. I told them there is just no way that is true. Your little anecdote here, makes me understand why my friends told me that."
149,Woke up in bed and my wife wasnt there at 4AM. Look around the house and she was nowhere to be found and her car was gone. Freaked out wondering where she went. Turns out an Einsteins bagels opened near us with 50 free bagel coupons for the first 50 customers so she went to stand in line.

155,You’re breathtaking!
156,"You didn't fuck up, though.

157,You sister and BIL need to reimburse you.
158,"I'm just gonna say it, this sounds made up."
159,"DON'T CHANGE YOUR NAME!  The paperwork is easy for the change, but think about everything it will effect.  Drives license, passport, work documentation, IRS, retirement, bank accounts, credit card accounts, loans, gym membership and your blockbuster card"

161,This EXACT post was posted a couple weeks ago
162,"Hello, I’m actually a doctor and I can prescribe you some medicine: watch A Bug’s Life."
163,Good for you for going to do it in person. I think that's the one chance you have of saving the friendship.
164,I'm kinda intrigued with their sense of humor
165,I assumed she'd puke over his head.
166,Didn't have to. He grabbed the tip himself.
167,"Ugh, same. But seriously who doesn't open a box of anything for like, a year?!"
168,At least your wife didn’t catch you watching her sister’s VR porn like that other guy
169,"You know, this was bound to come to a head sooner or later."
170,"Pack it up boys, we've made the best comment on reddit"

176,if it was true!
177,"I was washing my wife's toys after naughty time. She went down stairs for water. As I was finishing with a thin pink one my stepdaughter came in and screamed what are you doing with that?!? I say cleaning it a little off kilter. She than asked why I had her dildo and why I went through her things. I calmly told her this was her mother's. By this time my wife is coming up the stairs. Her daughter ran back to her room. I told my wife about it who double checked it was hers. My stepdaughter texted me ""Sorry"". To this day I am not allowed to make any sex toy related jokes."
178,"At least he didn't write that he liked to stick them up his butt, while watching vr"
179,"A+, Jayne."
180,"So I have a fun perspective about something like this... I'll try to keep story time short.

My Dad is not my birth father, but raised me from the age of 1. Hence the name Dad. I met my birth father a handful of times as a child. At 7, my Dad legally adopted me and I took his last name, but I have my birth fathers name as my middle from birth.

When I met my wife, she was one of 3 sisters with 2 beloved and departed brothers who didn't make it past adolescence. She was quite keen on keeping her last name, as her brothers were gone, and since I do have a little brother who is my Dads blood child with his name, I didn't think it would be a big deal.

When our marriage rolled around, we decided we wanted our family to have a unified name for our son, so we decided to use hers. My Dad was pretty upset about this, and I got to hear his perspective and his struggle to get my birth father to sign off his rights to me. 

So what I ended up doing was taking my Dads first name as my NEW middle, and changing my last for MY family. I still generally operate under my Dads last name (Work, Social Media, casual accounts, etc) but as far as the legal side I have my wife's, for finance and SS etc.

This means a lot to OPs stepfather, but his birth father may feel strongly also. I also know a couple who took a completely different 3rd last name when they got married, so men changing their names is slightly less of a social faux pas than even 20 years ago."
181,"I literally have arachnophobia and as soon as I seen the word spider I started to shiver, but at least I know someone is killing them for me."
182,"He really is. Every time I've taken edibles I've done the exact same thing I eat them thirty minutes goes by and I'm like I don't feel shit these things must have been weak. So I'll eat like one or two more cookies, and then it hits me and I'm like wow I'm so stupid I've done this before I should have known better. It's like I completely forget about the last time I had this experience and I end up stuck on a couch binge-watching an entire series of something on Netflix and then having an emotional breakdown because I feel attached to the characters and their strife is not my strife."
183,Note to self: don't cum on your work uniform.
184,"I did. A few times (technically). Just with varying degrees of directness.

Nowadays when he and I are discussing anything important I'm try to be about as subtle as a brick because he can still be pretty dense sometimes. *shrugs*"
185,Man I love how the TIFU mods have probably read a million stories about every disgusting sex act imaginable but THIS is where they draw the line (and to be fair I agree)
186,"""no thanks lady, sugar at night is the devil beckoning"""
187,I'm sure people at  r/cringe would appreciate this.
188,Girl: unzips even further
189,I can imagine the next ask Reddit. Hey doctors what is the weirdest thing your patient won't admit.
190,"YOU APOLOGIZE. 

In person.

From the heart."
191,This is the real punch line.
192,How about a nice game of chess?
193,Oh damn. I don't know how you come back from that

195,I raged at OP through the computer screen after reading that
196,Too true...seeing 65k vbucks and that sending you into a panic means you know how it works.
197,"It must have sucked, I'm sorry"
198,"it's the best fucking part; when you do an atrocious (but harmless) fuckup and then *do it again immediately after like life wasn't bad enough* 

Love it."
199,"Well... at least she didn’t reply, “not that long”?? 🤷🏻‍♂️"
200,..Similar story from the same holiday but a different night which I shall share soon. Stay tuned folks
201,Considering it sounded like the janitor sprayed them down with something too. Certain cleaners can do damage to toys!
202,I don't believe this story for a second. Sounds extremely made up.
203,This seems to be your primary account. Do you regret not making a throwaway?
204,"lol yes, edibles are definitely a rite of passage before heavyweight entrance."
205,"Nope. You can report them missing the second you notice they're missing. The police might not worry too much until a day has passed, but they will start keeping an eye out. They'll start looking immediately if the missing person a young child, an elderly person, or someone who could have injured themselves due to being mentally handicapped/ill, drunk, or on drugs."
206,"For me;

I get really warm
I get the  sweats
Heart rate increases big time(which can trigger anxiety attacks in people)
The spins
Can’t keep my eyes open

Shit like that. Think of having a really low tolerance for alcohol and drinking a quart of rum."
207,"Good on you for recognizing this.

I was into a girl for years through high school. Always very close friends, but there was never that ‘moment’ (or so I thought at the time). 

Had a bit of a tradition of going to her place and watching horror movies on Christmas Eve, because we were so edgy and cool. 

This time around, we’re both single, and there’s a little more obvious ‘tension’ in the air. I’m lay on her beds, and she’s sat on the edge of the bed beside me. At this point, I was a very skinny, very awkward teenager. 

She lay back on my chest and looked at me - it was ‘the moment’ I’d been waiting for - the first thing that fell out of my (STUPID F**KING) mouth was “I’m sorry, I’m not very comfortable.”

SHOOT ME. 

I meant “my chest does not provide much comfort as there is little padding”

She inferred “I don’t feel comfortable having your head on my chest”

She sat up so fast and looked absolutely devastated, and we watched the rest of the movie in silence. I realised IMMEDIATELY what I’d said, but I was too flabbergasted by the whole situation to even try and correct it. 

More than a decade later, happily married and I still wonder how that would have panned out and I not been such a mug.

My favorite story was doing rounds at 2am during holiday break. Since practically nobody was on campus I was in charge of four halls for that night which included all male, all female, and coed floors.

I was on my third hall when someone (probably drunk) pulled the fire alarm. This building was almost 100 years old and some wiring had failed so not every floor heard and/or saw the alarm go off. 

Soon the fire department comes and immediately notice not everyone was out of the building. So, in full gear, they go through each hall clearing everyone out. In total maybe 5 were escorted out by firemen. 

Well apparently a girl had gotten a monster dildo stuck in her ass and couldn't get it out and unfortunately it was suctioned to the bathroom wall so it went with her out the building.

So out comes a burly fireman carrying this Korean freshman girl completely naked in his arms with a rainbow dildo still in her ass crying with a face so red it would put Rudolph's nose to shame.

276,"See the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal is that not a lot of us have information we could use. Like there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it.

That’s five times more psychoactive than THC... and it lets you talk to dolphins."

&gt; Okay so you know some people have dark, dark, dark secrets Some people pick their nose, some pick it and eat it, some people eat shit, some people do really strange things. Well I like to eat live bugs. Nobody in my life knows this. I just like the way some of them are soft and taste quite gummy, I like how some are crunchy and almost explode in your mouth when you bite down.
&gt; 
&gt; I started eating bugs when I was a kid. I started with ladybugs, I just kept eating them, they secrete some bitter liquid which had a really nice acquired taste. I went from lady bugs to other bugs. woodlice were my second and they were crunchy and easy to find, they also felt nice to eat when they're in their ball state (a bit like cereal). The taste isn't really the thing I like most of the time, it's the texture, how it feels in my mouth. I love to eat them to this day. I went onto other insects as I got older, I started eating spiders. In the UK there are some spiders which come out at certain times of the year which can get BIG (I think it's called the brown spider or wolf spider). When they squirm when biting down it almost adds to the texture, and the liquid that comes out is really creamy and good to eat. The legs are the problem though as they get stuck in your teeth.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I ate one of those spindly spiders, the daddy long legs ones. I saw some in the corner of my room, minding thier own business in their web. A moth was stuck in the web (moths are disgusting they're like eating a spoon of flour). I put the spider in my mouth and proceeded to chew it. Now before I got my bite in to kill it, I think it bit me somehow on my tongue or something.
&gt; 
&gt; The worst burning sensation I have ever had happened at the moment. It was like my mouth was on fire, but not in a good way like spice. First my tongue was burning and it spread to my jaw and eventually I felt like my brain was going to come out. My tongue has a strange bumpy bit on it now and I don't know if I should see a doctor or not, and even if I did see the doctor. How the fuck do I tell him how it happened?
&gt; 
&gt; TL:DR
&gt; 
&gt; I have eaten insects all my life and a spider but the inside of my mouth"

It was NOT a good experience and I have since made my ps4 the primary account."

417,"1) If you only smoke 3-4 times a week with friends, and only a gram, why on earth would you consider yourself a heavyweight?

2)  if you’re growing your own, might I ask what strains you’re doing? 

3) how you cooked the butter matters, how long and at what temperature did you cook the butter for during infusion? And why on earth would you not do a conversion for mg per dose for your first cook? 

With 4g herb at 25%thc (example math problem for you next time)

.25 X 4g = 1gTHC x 1000(mg conversion rate) gives you 1000mg.

1000mgTHC(this is total THC in mg in your HERB) X .85(85% is roughly about the best case scenario on a butter cook for your absorption of the THC) which gives you *at best* 850mg in the actual butter.

Butter has 4 tablespoons per stick.

850mg total butter made
Divided by 4 (tablespoons)
Gives you 212.5mg PER TABLESPOON.

So, you used at *least* 2 tablespoons. And if each of you ate half. We’re back to that 212.5mgTHC for each of you.

That’s a massive dose.

I smoke close to 3 grams a day of that legal shit and I eat edibles just as much. But even my tolerance, anything past 75mg is probably gonna make me go take a nap. Lol or at least be stuck to the couch.

Next time, do yo homework boiii

Won’t get so hammered next time."

An adult male working with children. 
-Not particularly high risk on its own. 

An adult male not wearing boxers under normal clothes while working with children.
- Consequence of exposure to the children is very high, but liklihood of happening is low. Trousers don't usually fall off without some help.

An adult male, not wearing boxers and wearing tear away trousers while working with children.
- Consequence of exposure to the children is very high, And so is liklihood because of wardrobe malfunction due to tear away trousers.

Great example of the Swiss cheese model of accident causation right here.
