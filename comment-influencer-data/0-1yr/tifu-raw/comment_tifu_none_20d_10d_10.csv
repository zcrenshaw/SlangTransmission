0,Maybe I'm a prude but my SO isn't allowed to kiss other guys even if they're gay
1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aw9dzh/update_i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using/
2,"Well yeah, gay guys can have sex with women too."
3,What? I thought vagina's repel gay penises? Like similar poles of magnets.
4,"Only if they say ""No Hetero"" first"
5,I think you're thinking of /r/relationship_advice on that first one. Those two subs are basically the opposite ends of the spectrum
6,"There's actually a long and complex combination of up and downvote clicks which, if entered correctly, allows you to waste your time for ten seconds."
7,Poop socks?
8,Unless the wife was planning a surprise party with her gay party planner friend.
9,"My girlfriend left the window open in our apartment and now there's a couple flies in here, what do I do?

""Definitely break up with her right now. Major red flag."""
10,I binge them. It‚Äôs my guilty pleasure. I still think about the poop socks
11,click the upvote button twice and it sends a mega upvote
12,"She's obviously in some emotional turmoil right now. It's obvious you haven't been treating her right. The right choice right now is to give her some space and all the support she needs. It's all your fault

^/s ^fortheemotionallydense"
13,The TL:DR is fucking hilarious
14,You just have to have enough strength to brute force it in there
15,"I used to have a multireddit with theonion, nottheonion, and floridaman. Fun stuff"
16,"Thank you. There are heathens out there that exclude the ‚Äústart‚Äù, but I see you are cultured. 

I choose to believe Contra was your cheat game of choice."
17,"Thank you, good Redditor."
18,"No I passed up on it. Kind of one of those moments I think about from time to time and ask myself ""what if I just went with it?"" Could have had some fun, probably would have been a total mess. He was hitting on me the whole drive home too but I didn't exactly want to sleep with a married/soon to be divorced man's husband based off of the line ""hey want to do coke and trade blowjobs in a hotel room somewhere like back home in Miami?""

It was either going to be a horrific disaster or a story that stuck with me my whole life, or maybe both."
19,Go on
20,"Whoa whoa, let's not get ahead of ourselves"
21,I think the guys wife got the tip...
22,"Don‚Äôt forget that then you need to occasionally comment on other people‚Äôs replies to give those missing details. And finally once everyone realizes and tells you what an asshole you were, delete the original post and repost it exactly the same but with a different title."
23,"Or he could go to r/relationship_advice and get their useful ""break up immediately"" advice."
24,Something tells me cockandballtorture already googled it
25,"Cultured, but selfish. For not doing select then start."
26,I divorced my wife because I didn‚Äôt like something my Uber driver said. AITA?
27,"&gt; it was getting late (i think like 1 am) and we both like to cuddle (like, not in a gay way, just in a friends-way)

Straight men don't generally cuddle with other men.  I like to cuddle too, but it's just not a thought that really even crosses your mind.

Sounds to me like he's in denial and panicked."
28,So did you give him a ride to the next town?
29,"I hope so, probably saved him thousands over the course of the marriage.

Edit: Although he probably needs therapy for himself or the couple. Also, if they do end up getting a divorce they need a lawyer. So 50/50."
30,Can you make your own post or? Because wtf.
31,"The comments would probably be something like:

NTA. She sounds like entitled bitch and you‚Äôre 100% in the right. Oh you said you hit her around a bit too? Well, some would say that makes you an asshole but people are just too sensitive these days honestly you‚Äôre completely in the right. We need more justified assholes in the world these days."
32,Or post on AITA if he broke up with her. But then leave out key details of the story.
33,*updates destination to named bar*
34,Party time
35,Rest in piece my friend
36,"I know how you feel, when I was 4 or 5 I used my moms shower raiser to shave my tongue"
37,I honestly can‚Äôt even decipher what the hell I just read. It‚Äôs in English. But also somehow not.
38,This can't be real
39,Yeah you did him a solid
40,This is one of the best things I've read in a while.
41,"1.	Delete lawyer.
2.	Gym up.
3.	Hit the Facebook."
42,"Jfc dude, maybe don't body slam the only girl who's talking to you now you're ""that guy"". Maybe after the smoke clears you can explain yourself üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ but don't Batista bomb the mf."
43,"Did he forget to say ""no homo"" first?"
44,Ngl I love opening each one side by side and just reading the drama back to back.
45,RATE! RATE! RATE! ILL RATE YOU!
46,"You made a few mistakes that I can see. 

First you stated that ‚ÄúI guess I didn‚Äôt matter as much as an employee as I thought I did.‚Äù  Every one is replaceable. You should never threaten to quit to make a point. 

Second you refused to do tasks assigned by your manager. Unless there is a safety or similar issue you simply cannot do that. You can voice your concern over the CSRs loosing bookings but refusing to do the work you are assigned will never end well. 

Lastly you never quit a job without another job to go to. If things get bad enough that you want to quit then you suck it up and deal with it for however much time it takes to find another job. Bill collectors do not care if you were morally justified to quit your job, they inly care about getting paid."
47,"Handicap spots are a thing, he should have used them"
48,"Theres nothing wrong with putting an electric tootbrush in your mouth , mister ."
49,"I get the feeling you are either 

A doormat

The cheater."
50,I'M A FIVE STAR MAN!!!!!!!!!!
51,I hope so.  He is not giving her the tip anymore.
52,"To be fair... They did arrest the guy so the area would have been that much safer to stay in if you guys stuck it out. Plus, hot tub."
53,I'm not sure if this is more suitable for r/IncelTears or r/niceguys
54,"‚ÄúPlace was right next to a drug house. Got to see a live bust, undercover cops and all! Owner was understanding and gave us our money back. 10/10 would book for a full refund again.‚Äù"
55,"There's a section on AirBnB where you can buy ""experiences"", like bike riding or tours for museums, things like that. That's basically what I got: a free experience from AirBnB, hahaha"
56,the real question is: did you rub one out????
57,"No no I was there, I was one of the millions of sperm"
58,Sounds like she ruined a marriage and you saved a man. Good job.
59,"On the note of being the only one they'll be physical with, having a discussion about an open relationship is the way to go about that concern, not resigning yourself to the fact that they'll eventually go behind your back and cheat and you just have to be alright with that. 

The way I see it, straightforward, honest communication is very important to the foundation of a relationship along with mutual respect, and cheating basically the opposite of all those things."
60,Well played..
61,"You did that guy a solid, but you shouldn‚Äôt be telling riders where you took other passengers. Imagine if you accidentally told an abuser where their victim went, or spilled the beans that you just took somebody‚Äôs employee to interview for another job.  Or if you took someone to a medical appointment they weren‚Äôt ready for their family to know about.

Not a FU to let the dude know about what sure sounds a lot like cheating. Definitely a FU to assume everybody staying in a house  should know where their friends and family went."
62,"Jesus, that sub swung right from breakup first ask questions second, to nurturing broken relationships so quick."
63,"Little kids put everything in their mouths, although that‚Äôs typically more of a 2-4 year old thing I think."
64,Definitely a bong OP albeit a huge one.
65,You are potato.
66,"In case you didn‚Äôt know, Jenny is the star of one the best TIFU‚Äôs. Here‚Äôs a link. https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2sxi5v/who_is_jenny_and_why_does_everyone_hate_her/"
67,"^(on no, socks were off too!)"
68,"&gt;It was about a year after we broke up that it popped in my head and I realized what the fuck happened.

Don't worry. I once asked one of my girlfriends to come with me on an event. She got an hour too late and I was already partying. I received a text from her ""Want to do some fun stuff in our hotel room?"" I told her: ""Nope, the big party just got started""

*... took me 4 years to realise what she really meant with that.*"
69,"Sorry but you‚Äôre acting as if he leaked someone‚Äôs credit card details - he shouldn‚Äôt get fired over it, that‚Äôd be absolute bs - if the wife is whoring around then that‚Äôs her fault"
70,"You didn't FU a marriage.

The cheating bitch did."
71,"I was also there, we swam together."
72,Wear it with pride.  You'll start a new trend.
73,"*You* didn't ruin a marriage, the (allegedly) cheating wife did. You were just the reason he found out about it."
74,"You could have saved this man years, maybe even the rest of his life, of him not knowing he was getting cheated on"
75,"Man I don't see this as you ruining a marriage. Wife ruined the marriage, what you did should be considered a public service."
76,"Today I Hung Up? Today I Helped Up? Today I Hocked Up?

I can't figure out what the H is supposed to be!"
77,"You didn't fuck up a marriage, you uncovered a cheater who fucked up the marriage"
78,"hope the husband asked the real questions, unless he likes it that way, gives him more time with his side piece."
79,"I have friends (""Mark"" and ""Steve"") whose relationship began kinda like this. Funny thing is, Mark had found his *girlfriend* ""Christa"" naked with some other guy in a bedroom at a party and caught a ride home with Steve, whom he'd just met. Steve thought Mark was cute and felt sorry for him. 

They bitched about the evils of cheating on the way there, got drunk as they were packing Mark's stuff and ended up making out. Christa came home to find the two of them in bed and freaked out. Mark freaked out too internally, but kept his cool as he told her that it was any of her concern -- **she'd officially put him off women forever**...and Steve had turned him onto men.

Massive ego blow and boost in one sentence, folks!

Mark never had a conscious interest in men until then, nor for any man since except Steve for that matter. Steve fell in love that night and hasn't fallen out since. They've been together for some twenty-five years now, married since it was legal in California and they're happier than most couples I know."
80,I‚Äôm laughing so hard at this someone gild this man  i‚Äôd do it myself if i had money.
81,"\&gt;at school

\&gt;somewhat familiar female approaches me with arms open for a hug

\&gt;I spread my arms too for a distraction but I know what has to be done

\&gt;at the last moment I pick her up by the waist

\&gt;her face is a mixture of confusion and fear

\&gt;I lift her high over my head

\&gt;she screams and struggles in despair as panic takes her over

\&gt;""WWE Supah Slammmm!!!""

\&gt;I swing my arms back to gain momentum and with my manly might throw her over my head as hard as I can

\&gt;she flies across the room and smashes into a cluster of desks

\&gt;between whimpers and cries I hear the words ""what the fuck is wrong with you?""

\&gt;I calmly tip my fedora, turn around and walk into the sunset

\&gt;virginity protected for another day"
82,sorting top by all time on /r/relationship_advice will kill a whole day.
83,That‚Äôs some Ocean‚Äôs eleven type stuff
84,Dennis? Dennis Reynolds?
85,You didn‚Äôt ruin a marriage. She did.
86,Cheating is never excusable. Divorce the person if you want to fuck other people so bad.
87,You did the guy a huge favor.
88,"Cheating is bad, but as an Uber driver, you should be fired for this. It's not your business to talk about the activities of other customers - I don't want my Uber driver telling other people ""Hey, I saw one of my customers take such-and-such a route"". I don't travel anywhere sketchy (or interesting), but still - this is a major privacy violation."
89,"\&gt;  I may have ruined a marriage  

You didn't ruin a marriage, you saved that guy years of deception and heartache from his cheating bitch of a ""wife"".

You did the right thing."
90,Tbh he deserves to know if he's being cheated on.
91,"Oh fuxk, was that the one with the gf who always wiped her ass with the dudes socks  and then made a big thing about always wanting to do his laundry for him? Yeah I remember that one, good shit."
92,You didn‚Äôt ruin the marriage.
93,"Sounds dumb, it‚Äôll pass. Don‚Äôt worry about it."
94,Let's be real here... Who cleans it after EVERY use....
95,"&gt;Sioux City

Definitely meth"
96,Jesus Christ.
97,WHY WOULD YOU EVER SHAVE YOUR TONGUE???
98,TIFU by reading this story....
99,Naaaah. You a bro. You basically gave him a hint on how to beat the last boss with life.
100,"You didn't fuck up a marriage, she did."
101,Not a fuck up on your part. Definitely the wife's fault. You honestly did the man a favor by saving him lots of time from that marriage that is going to fall apart.
102,None of that was your fault
103,She ruined the marriage. TSFU by having an affair. You're a hero fir letting the dude know before an STD or accidental pregnancy did.
104,"No fuck up here.

You are literally the most honest person in his life right now. You did him a favor and now he can break the lie he realized his life is."
105,TOPL (Today the OP Learned) who the real asshole is.
106,Mankrik's wife?
107,"Similar story, when I was 5 I went through my mom's purse and found some gum. Popped a bunch cuz they we're tiny AF. It was the nastiest gum I ever chewed on. Went to tell my mom.

""Mom the gum in your purse is gross""

""Honey...what are you talking about I don't have any g-...""

Face goes white.

""Oh no...Oh GOD NO my birth control!""

I didn't know why that was but her shocked face scared me. She ran off. I forgot about it almost instantly because 2min before I ate that ""gum"" I had found a transformer in her closet I was sure was meant for my birthday. I remembered that and forgot about it. 

The good news is I don't think it fucked me up it's been like 18 years and not long after that incident my mom got pregnant with my baby brother and my dad was pissed. 

""She said she was on birth control!"" I remember him ranting around the house. 

Not sure if the two are actually related and I caused some hormonal imbalance, but It seems oddly coincidental."
108,"""I would never cuddle with my guy friends, even the closest ones...""

*proceeds to describe circumstances under which he would cuddle with his guy friends.*"
109,Rico Rodriguez ain't gotten anythin on u mate
110,Did a 5 year old me clean it. Imma have to say no
111,"No, HE will lol omg please tell me how this ends I'm already so invested üòÇ"
112,"His wife ruined the marriage.  It's her TIFU, not yours."
113,Same
114,"See, the thing you're not understanding is you assume I was talking specifically about one person or the other. 

You should stay out of strangers business all the time. Regardless of your profession. If no one is in danger, it ain't your concern."
115,And tack on a tip after.
116,You fucked up a marriage in the best way possible.
117,I mean I don't support this and it's horrible but .. this is exactly how it could work yes.
118,"All i can say is, The Fuck? 

Hell no. That is happiness based on a lie. A wife cheating on the husband and not telling him is not happy with the husband. And a husband who isn‚Äôt being told the truth is being disrespected by the wife."
119,*The best!*
120,Up up down down left right left right B A start.
121,Nah. She ruined the marriage. Thank you for your service.
122,Its called earning a living and if your mom lives off him she should appreciate how much of his time he sacrifices to put food on the table.
123,"Or they're 12, which is more likely"
124,Fair point.
125,You disgust me.
126,"You might have saved the dude from an awful marriage, actually."
127,"Seriously, no one was going to be pulling any shit there after that."
128,Maybe... his wife ruined the marriage....
129,"You didnt ruin his marriage, she did"
130,lol as if reddit is one person that just flips their mind.
131,This sounds like a meth bust. That's really the only thing you'll find manufactured in the US (easily) that requires breathing masks.
132,"You may have ruined this marriage, but you also may have saved a future, healthier marriage."
133,"I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a comment. When I saw the name above, I lost it."
134,"You did him a favor. Without you, this cheating pos would have gotten away with it.

Kudos mate"
135,LOL yeah man this is snapchats fault
136,"shoulda just followed it up by saying ""whut? WHUT?!"""
137,"Well, don't beat yourself too much over it. You'd b e in a pretty bad shape if those 5 man decided to beat you up. Not much an adult can do in that situation unless you're Rambo or Jackie Chan. You did what you could in a time of peril."
138,Exactly. The OP did nothing wrong. He helped that poor guy out.
139,"This.  

Everyone ask yourselves if you're being cheated on: would you want to know?  Unless you're Mario Winans, the answer is yes.  The people who reveal cheaters don't ruin relationships, it's the cheaters ruin who their relationships."
140,I mean you probably saved that guy from a long lie.
141,That's a no from me dawg. If you cheat out of revenge you sink to the same level as the one who cheated first.
142,Your math doesn't check out.  You say 20 years ago in the OP...
143,"Nothing to blame yourself for; hell, I think it was for the best. It's not like you made the wife cheat on him; the wife is the one who should be responsible of whatever happens to her marriage because of her cheating."
144,F
145,With crack sprinkled all over your dead suicided body.
146,You didn't fuck anything up. She did by cheating.
147,It should be...
148,Because you probably played 2 player (the select changed it to 2 player mode).
149,Kissing your secret lover on the porch of your own house is not the best way to hide an affair.
150,Mods gay
151,Thank you
152,Aaaand that's a fact
153,Why do I feel like you use this logic to justify you‚Äôre own cheating?
154,"What nonsense did I just read? So cheating and hiding something from the person you promised ""until death do us part"" is ok as long as they don't find out? It will manifest itself in other ways over time. Them being distant spending ""late nights at the office"" whatever. Prolonging that only exacerbates the grief. It's better to just be up front, truthful, and get it over with whatever your decision may be."
155,Why do you act like you did a bad thing? It's good that you told him.
156,You're in the wrong subreddit.
157,I didn't say it was a bong. I said it was a complicated object that shared the resemblance of one. Had a bunch of different tubes on the sides and was about 3 feet tall.
158,She fucked up first
159,"Oh, YOU messed up a marriage? I don't think so."
160,"You didn't fuck up the marriage. She did.

You saved him a lot of time, and perhaps money and grief."
161,Or don't get married in the first place.
162,You did this man a solid bro. It‚Äôs not a fuck up
163,"Well if you're paying attention to the 23 and me test result stories that have been coming out, it seems promiscuity is fairly common in supposedly stable marriages. Perhaps it's time we accept that sexuality is more complicated than just promising to another person you'll never bump uglies with someone you're attracted to. Also, there are people that use marriage and having children to try and ""fix"" a relationship all the time, which is kind of like setting a time bomb on your relationship."
164,"""Emotionally dense"" is now my favourite insult, second only to calling someone a ""gormless Jeb""."
165,"Well yeah, if you read _everything_ then the theory is shattered."
166,But did you stick around for the pick up for when she got kicked out?
167,"Agreed, but think of it this way: would you want your Uber driver leaking information about your movements? I wouldn't. 

That said, I've had way more invasive conversations with Uber drivers. I took a ride from the City to the East Side one morning (about 3AM), I wasn't up to anything interesting, just needed a ride late.

Uber driver: ""So...are you...gonna have some FUN tonight?""
Me: ""Actually, I'm just going home.""
Uber driver: ""I see...so then... FUN COMPLETED, eh? eh?"""
168,"No, you didn't ruin that marriage.  She did."
169,"I would have done it , simply because life is boring and I like seeing people‚Äôs top 1% worst days. Makes my life feel better."
170,Apparently it's insecure to not want your SO to kiss someone else lol. Get over yourself.
171,She ruined the marriage. You did the guy a solid.
172,The person that ruined the marriage was the wife.  Not you.
173,"It sounds to me like she's being a drama llama. rather than trying to make amends, just ignore it. Eventually she'll get bored, cuz in all reality, she probably does this to everyone that slightly offends her, and putting effort into trying to get her to stop is only going to make the situation worse.

TL;DR Essentially, ignore it and she'll get distracted and everyone will forget."
174,"Fuck that dude. I HATE people that cheat. And since it‚Äôs the wife the convo would go something like this:

So you cheated me huh?

What do you mean, no I didn‚Äôt

The Uber guy said he saw a man leave here and hour ago

Oh. So you‚Äôre talking about ME to random people now? What else are you hiding. You know what, no. I‚Äôm going to my moms for the weekend and you can think about how shitty you are. 

......"
175,"You didn‚Äôt fuck up.  She did.

Edit: then again she might have fucked down"
176,"Buddy, that marriage was already ruined. In fact, you may have saved a man a lot of time and money today, so good job."
177,"You didn‚Äôt ruin the marriage, the infidelity did."
178,"""Allowed""?

Your SO isn't your property."
179,You guys sound like absolute weenies. You weren't in any danger but felt you could no longer stay there?
180,"The Jerry McGuire reference, though, might work on her mom"
181,Raiser lol....razor
182,"That‚Äôs not correct - not defending anyone here but the term is derived from spinning multiple plates at a time like at a carnival, rather than settling down with one person - people in multiple casual ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù are said to be spinning multiple plates

Edit: punctuation"
183,Phones are not allowed where he is.
184,r/theyalmostdidthemath ???
185,You did the right thing. This is a TIWAB (today I was a bro)
186,"I actually used to go between Tampa and Philadelphia regularly- and almost every flight home to Philly came in 14-30 minutes early, because of tailwinds presumably."
187,She brought you to this world and she has seen her share of penis.
188,"You haven't ruined anything, his slutty wife fucked it up. If you called the cops on a theif would you say you ruined his life by getting him arrested? No!"
189,thanks :)
190,He wanted to cross lightsabres.
191,I think that you should respect the decisions he makes from now on regarding the relationship between you two.
192,"More like you saved someone from continually being lied to, and treated like shit."
193,"Have you ever been in a relationship where someone cheated? All trust is gone, when you leave for business or work you are always wondering what is happening at home. You can't think straight, sex life practically becomes nonexistent for a while. It's the end of THAT relationship and a different takes it's place. It's not the same ever again. Sure people can and do stay together and get past it. But that relationship is never the same."
194,Oh my
195,Would save him countless years wasted though. You decide...
196,"Bruh how did you ruin the marriage, the cheating spouse ruined the marriage. If anything you did this guy a solid."
197,That happened to me once! Flight to Boston went super quick and got there 45 min early
198,"&gt;Wait so is it real?

As real as any other ""my beautiful girlfriend cheated on me and I don't know why because I'm rich and have a big dick"" borderline humble brag TIFU's are, sure.

Real or not, it was a story to behold."
199,The cheater is the only one at fault for cheating. There's never a reason to cheat.
200,What?
201,"You didn‚Äôt ruin a marriage, it was already gone my dude. You helped that guy out. Nobody should be in the dark if their significant other is slapping meat behind their back."
202,"She didn't even want to eat it, why did she get mad?"
203,New on FOX - Cops! Live!!
204,"Depends on how low your standard is for a reasonable human I guess. I would imagine most would consider cheating pretty easy not to do, and hardly asking for perfection in asking to not cheat."
205,You saved that guy. Not a fuck-up.
206,You saved a man‚Äôs life. His cheating wife ruined the marriage.
207,You did the right thing tbh
208,Sort by controversial of the week and get some popcorn
209,That is not at all what I'm suggesting. It is still a shitty thing to get involved with someone else without even mentioning it to the other person. It's dishonest and an emotionally damaging. I'm just pointing out that traditional relationships are often as promiscuous as open relationships (although both can be done in a dishonest way).
210,"haha, you didn't ruin a damn thing. You just gave that man information that others hire people just to get."
211,"‚ÄúHello Child Protective Services here. How may I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dad Bruce Lee kicked me D;‚Äù"
212,Ah you‚Äôre good when I was in high school during the emo phase a bunch of guys wore their sister pants. Wear em proud haha
213,"Stop being triggered you twat. You and your SO are in a mutual relationship. That has benefits and rules. Your SO is not **allowed** to break those rules. If they do, you‚Äôre done. Shut up with your self righteous white knighting."
214,"If you're in school learn that the word is ""clothes"" not ""close."""
215,"At least it wasnt your mom in the video, or WAS IT??? HUEHUEHUE"
216,"Cheating isn't a symptom of anything. It's the end.

No one should tolerate a cheater. They should be forced by society to have to marry each other."
217,"Oh my God, just the titles are pure gold. I'm gonna waste so many hours."
218,Uhhhhhh if this was in the hamptons this was my buddy LMFAO he talked about it on our podcast last week!! The wife texted him last week and told him everything that happened after
219,Lol true.she probably had an O then rolled over to sleep.
220,This is more of a Today i Fixed than Fucked
221,"I know how you feel OP, i've put your mom's vibrator inside my mouth too."
222,Accidental anal is worst! I'll pray for your asshole to make a speedy recovery lol
223,And I automatically downvoted any jackass who has to make a comment stating he did. Lol
224,"you didnt fuck up a marriage, she did. You saved a guy possibly several years"
225,You did the dude a favor my man.
226,Well now it‚Äôs a thing. ‚ÄúHave a good day at work! Don‚Äôt get too stoned!‚Äù Never thought that‚Äôd be a phrase I‚Äôd hear. It did make for a solid laugh tho.

231,"As a straight guy I‚Äôve NEVER gotten a boner in the company of my (guy) friends, I also wouldn‚Äôt kiss any of my friends back if they tried to kiss me, that‚Äôs a no-brainer for me and any straight guy I know. Your friend may be a little bit on the gay (or at least bi) side"

I don't care if he doubts it. Shit, if reddit (or the internet) was around then, I would of posted it then."
233,Why would you bother for consent? That's rape!
234,"easier said than done. I bet most of the people who cheat didn‚Äôt have that intention when marrying, yet its still very common. It‚Äôs like people cannot control themselves and society is OK with it"

242,"I'd rather know, you're all good."
243,"The marriage was already fucked up. This is like saying ""today I fucked up a family when I discovered the children locked up in the basement."" Or, ""today I fucked up a guy's house by telling him there was a hole in his roof."""
244,"Don‚Äôt scald yourself, dude deserved to know"
245,Approached your family to tell them why you were fired?  Without your permission?  They can't do that.

252,"I was once an uber driver. Picked up a pool near the hood. A guy got his, well what I would imagine to be his girl, a pickup. I roll up and he kissed her goodbye and everything. Get another ding for a pickup several blocks down. Some super cholo guy. Well I was about 15 and 30 minutes away from their destinations respectively. 

They made small talk and he asked for her # to which she said it's not connected but not to call her yet. At his dropoff, they just macked it up in my backseat. Then he left. I went to the middle of nowhere to drop her off. As the meter was still running on the dude's dime, I called him.

Me: hey it's me, your uber driver. i dropped off your girl.

Guy who paid for fare: oh cool man, thanks for letting me know.

Me: also fyi I picked up some dude and they were just macking it up. if i wasn't around, i swear they were gonna bone.

Guy: DAMN! for reals?

Me: Yes. I figured you'd know mostly because you paid for this ride to get her home.

Guy:  You are one cool dude, thanks for being the homie. Bitch is gonna get hers.

\*hangs up\*

I got a 5\* review and a fat $50 tip."
253,"You didn‚Äôt ruin a marriage, she did. You just unwittingly informed her husband of that fact and it‚Äôs a good thing you did. I‚Äôd rather know than be made more of a fool as she continues cheating."
254,"Hey man, cheaters ruin their marriages, not people who unintentionally out them. I wouldnt feel bad at all if I was you. Maybe a little awkward perhaps.

Well, I mean I'd feel bad for the person who was getting cheated on for having been the one who told them about it but what I mean is just that it's hardly your fault if the marriage goes imploded.

And who knows, maybe it wasn't a fuck-up afterall. Maybe they'll be better off. Either by splitting up or by working things out. Could be you did them a favor in the end. Lol.

Anyways, quality tofu. Well done."
255,You didn't ruin the marriage. The wife did by cheating.
256,*She* fucked up their marriage. You just brought that to light.
257,"&gt;Perhaps it's time we accept that sexuality is more complicated than just promising to another person you'll never bump uglies with someone you're attracted to. 

Then that should be establish before promising yourself to one individual.

You don't ""surprise"" someone with an open relationship. That's awful."
258,Not even on the dick?!
259,"You did a good thing.  You saved him years of his life wasted on someone who doesn't love him.  You saved him from continuing to live a lie.  He can now be free to go find real happiness if he wants to.  You gave him that gift.  Painful now, sure, but far better in the long run."
260,"With the scale of the drug bust, my dad and I think there's probably multiple people involved in the manufacturing. Seems very unlikely for an operation that big to be run by 1 single guy. We joked and made a hypothetical situation of the drug dealer's associates coming in later tomorrow, seeing the whole place cleaned out, wondering what happened, haha"
261,That bitch ruined their marriage not you. It was ruined the second she wanted some strange cock.
262,You earned that 5 star rating. That dude hopefully left you a big tip.
263,You didnt fuck up at all the wife (exwife) did
264,You didn't ruin his marriage. That is 100% on his wife's shoulders.
265,"I had this happen to me in high school. In my senior year i dated a girl who identified as bi. It was pretty cool and we'd check girls out together. One day she outright told me that one of her friends thought i was cute and that if id be open to ditch to her friends house to go have some fun. Back then i had only been with two girls and i completely collapsed in self doubt that I'd be able to perform. Don't remember how exactly the conversation ended, but i remember feeling like a loser. She ended things shortly after that."
266,"The original trope  is

267,your boss seems unreasonable
268,lol she wants to go down on you and you think about your mum. sad story bruh
269,"I never get why people who expose cheaters call it ""Ruining"" a marriage. She was cheating, that marriage was already ruined, all you did was save him years of grief."
270,"This was karma hitching a ride with you to get to his wife.

You couldn't have possibly known and you were doing your job by being pleasant. 

You did this man a favour, and probably saved someone the heartache of having to tell him as a friend."
271,Personally I don‚Äôt think so but it was never confirmed either way. I remember how OP worded things just sounded like a teenager was writing it
272,Asking the important questions
273,Well honestly he deserves to know. Screw her
274,*taps temple
275,"Lmfao, the mechanics at my shop would have just burst out laughing. They literally see EVERYTHING. it‚Äôs an honest accident, that just happens to be slightly embarrassing. üòÇ"
276,Yeah it's not nearly as bad as some of the ones on here
277,"Let me make this clear.

YOU didn't fuck up anything. The cheating wife and her accomplice fucked up that marriage. Don't blame yourself for being friendly and making small talk. You can't predict the future my man, and you don't know everything. You're good and keep doing what you're doing."
278,"You didn't ruin a marriage, the cheating wife did. All you did was save the guy some years of his life."
279,"And you're super dumb to bring an absolutely irrelevant point to the matter. This entire post and this comment thread have obviously been about kissing in a romantic way. If you didn't see that you're just clueless. Yes, it's perfectly ok to do that if that's your cultural norm, but like I said that's completely irrelevant to this situation because that's not what's being discussed. 

Honestly your point reminds of those dumbass kids in middle school who would say you're gay if you kiss your Dad. You take away any idea of context, apply your own thoughts, and think that's all that matters."
280,"Pretty easy to go a thousand miles near a ""real"" city considering I'm from Los Angeles, and go there every year to visit my family, but you're right. LA is tiny, I'll never make it in a REAL city like Sioux Falls, South Dakota."
281,"Don't you fret. The marriage was likely already ruined. It could have been a brother, assuming they weren't kissing in THAT way."
282,"Are you saying not being comfortable with physical intimacy with a person you otherwise enjoy being around is toxic and an indication of being uncomfortable with their own sexuality? 

I sure as hell hope not, because that would be presumptuous and fucking rude."
283,"Anytime I read one of these posts, be it here or elsewhere on reddit, I'm surprised that you blame yourself for unknowingly revealing that someone else had been cheating. That marriage would've been ruined down the road anyways because of the actions of that woman. If anything you should be on the opposite sub of /r/tifu, but I wouldn't know what that would be."
284,For real. Just RKO her out of no where. Make sure no one is watching.
285,It really is because it's gotta be genuine. Who on Earth would think up such a crazy story? Poop socks.
286,Of course! His name is peanut and I‚Äôve had him since he was a kitten. He was a stray we found in the parking lot of my wife‚Äôs apartment building.
287,"Sorry man but that does it, ur screwed! But in all seriousness I‚Äôd recommend waiting a few days and then messaging him if he‚Äôs alright"
288,Now I'm concerned about why my brain is shoving a 'select' between A and start. What the hell did I play as a kid?
289,"After seeing the picture, I'm pretty sure that's a large water bong."
290,Should be called Ride Over-Sharing.
291,"I agree. For privacy sake OP shouldn't tell where he took other passengers. One of the first thoughts I had when reading it was, ""What if OP is actually mistaken about it being the same house?"" Some neighborborhoods have cookie cutter homes that all look alike.

But F that lady if she really is cheating...."
292,"Dude i dont know if you ruined the marriage-

you just saved this guy a lifetime of hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

good on you"
293,"Correction dear sir, You mightve saved this guy from a marriage built on cheating."

299,"Wow, I read this whole thing think you were a girl - great plot twist at the end."
300,Or kick him
301,"I probably shouldn't tell this story but I guess I'm gonna since something remotely similar happened with my son yesterday, luckily we were at home.

My son is 6. He likes to say poop, pee and butt **a lot**. Well yesterday, I said come upstairs 'son's name'

And he says ""come in my butt dad"" I didn't know what to say. All I could do was to tell him not to say butt, but we've been telling him that for months. I just have to be real careful what I say."
302,It seemed like a scam but you risked it because he was offering a crazy amount? That's just another red flag
303,"Bring a bottle of Tabasco sauce and give it a couple shakes into the condom after your done.  If you hear screaming, leave.  Does that qualify as beyond recovery?"

305,"Deal! I've heard of it, but haven't checked it out."
306,"I hope every single person who uses it loses everything they love the most during the times in their lives they need them the most.

307,Clickbait is so ingrained in our culture that I think suicide is the only option to escapte it....
308,I have a bit of C-PTSD and if someone touches me unexpectedly I have been known to scream like I was being murdered. It definitely makes me look somewhat like a drama queen / unstable.

312,Waaaaaaaaaah
313,This is refreshing! A story I believe that's simple and a real oh I fucked moment
314,"A few days ago my wife told our four year old, 'if you are not going to stop whining I am going to give you a smack.' My son's face all of a sudden brightened up and he said ''Yeeaaahh snack! I want the snack!"" In short, kids mishear too sometimes."
315,What‚Äôs pizza like where you‚Äôre from? Ever had pizza in America ?
316,Read what you quoted. Dumbass.
317,"If I had to guess, he ordered a Yeet Cannon, which is a $200 9mm pistol made by hi-point. However, I doubt the veracity of his claim, because I've looked for guns on amazon, and they don't sell them.

Even if this was true, to buy a pistol you need either a permit to purchase, or a concealed carry permit. I don't see OP mentioning shipping it to somebody with a FFL (federal firearms licences) either, which you have to do when you order guns online. There's definitely no way that it came with tape on it that says "" happy back to school year"" either.

Fun fact: It's illegal to leave guns where kids can access them.

In conclusion, this story was a (poorly-written) creative writing exercise.

P.S. If you're looking for a good gun, Yeet Cannon isn't the way to go. Hi-point is known for making cheap firearms. I'd still get one (because it's called the yeet cannon, I mean why not right?), but it's not a dependable firearm."

331,"The longer it goes on the worse the wound. Cheating is already a nasty, nasty wound to heal from, but adding heaps of time upon it makes it that much more devastating. Also, most affairs don't last longer than a few months before someone slips up typically, so the odds of going an entire lifetime require either complete ignorance by the cheated, or the cheatee is incredibly dutiful in keeping secrets."
332,"Imagine you're the victim of some big lie right now. Getting to know it would crush your world. I don't know about your life situation, age or gender, but maybe you are being cheated on *right now*, but you're fine, because you don't know.

So how you feel right now is exactly the same how you would feel when you are being cheated on.

The knowing part makes all the difference. The point is that you never *know* that you don't know."
333,Guy deserved to know as long as OP had the house right
334,"You didn't fuck up, you did him a huge fucking favor."
335,"Let's see what happens if I just leave this here.

336,"Your point is that the guy should‚Äôve been just blind to the fact that his wife is cheating on him and should‚Äôve carried on through life not knowing she‚Äôs unfaithful. It doesn‚Äôt matter because in the end, she‚Äôs untrustworthy regardless.

Great point. Really full of insight and knowledge./s"
337,"I'd still recommend it, I know I'm in the minority that has these sorts of issues, just do your research and you'll understand 99% of the time it's absolutely fine."
338,"&gt; No fuck up here

Well, OP did say ""Today I fucked up a marriage,"" and, in a way, he did fuck it up. Not his fault, and he did the right thing, but that marriage is probably pretty fucked up atm."
339,Welp you end up with a funny story. Got to say probably would've ended differently for me

345,"I went hunting one season, and was up in a stand (that's how we do it in Texas). This nice plump doe walked out and was munching as easy as you please. Now I was hunting for food, so I was glad to take her. The problem was, the window to the blind was too low for me. So I'm hunched over the rifle trying to line up my shot, and I get my face too far forward. When I made the shot, the scope caught me right between the eyes and the deer ran off. I know you're supposed to wait, but I couldn't help myself, and I went over to where the deer had been to look for blood. I get a bit excited when I see a drop of blood on a rock. But then I see another one appear. And another. And I realize that I'm bleeding down my face from where the scope cut me. It was a shitty day hunting, and humiliating to go back to camp like that.

But, I went to the range the next day, shot a bit to remind myself that I could hit the broadside of a barn, then went back and took 2 nice does that season, both with clean kill shots (one ran about 50 feet, the other dropped where it stood). They were damn tasty, and provided some much needed food for my family. The point is, you gotta get back on that horse, man. Accidents happen. You learn from them and move on."
346,"Today I fucked up by making someone miserable for a shorter time than -

362,"That's the tricky part. If your partner asked you ""hey would you mind if I cheated but you never knew?"", then it would, of course, make you suspicous. 

But if she just did it behind your back and now tell you, of course you *wouldn't mind because you wouldn't know.*

The thought that your partner could cheat on your *of course* bothers you, but ***not being cheated on*** **and** ***not knowing that you're being cheated on*** **feels exactly the same.**"
363,"I agree with you on a technical level.   Sometimes the right thing is also the incorrect thing.   If the wife wanted to press it she could probably get him fired from Uber and rightfully so.

You cheat, you leave. I don't need to know, nor care what reason the person had. No reason is good enough to cheat. None.

In more mundane settings, children and teenagers need some privacy from their parents and authorities to grow and develop. You don‚Äôt want people looking at your browsing history. And so forth. 

Yes, it catches cheaters too, but is that a price worth paying?"
433,"Dude, you helped him. This is a good thing."
434,Gave you an upvote because it is perfectly reasonable that you understand that it is perfectly reasonable that they understand OP's arguments.
435,"Well for starters, you should have had him take you to the bar to point the guy out...it might be someone you know."
436,"You? Ruin it? You did that man a favor! The wife ruined it, not you."
437,Sure! I mean... We are all free to talk nonsense shit based on nothing concrete.
438,"Translation: He has a coworker who cheated. His other coworker revealed that the person had been cheating. The one who was cheated on made up with the cheater, but remained upset at the person that told her and felt they were trying to ruin their marriage by telling."
439,"only if you fly first class, coach still arrives on time or late"
440,"I was once on a flight that caught a favorable tailwind or something and arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule.  Pilot apologized for it when we landed, must've been as confused as we were."
441,Holy shit you got 3k likes and your first medal? Automatically downvote any jackass who edits their comment to thank someone for getting they can‚Äôt use in real life. So fucking annoying
442,Why would you think this is you ruining the marriage? You did nothing but make conversation.
443,Now he gets a bigger surprise
444,"Yeah, you fucked up.  A bump on skin means give your cat an allergy pill?  
Doesn‚Äôt sound like you put any thought to your response."
445,"Proves the point IMO. The more secrets are unearthed, the less secrets the government has to blackmail you with."
446,"&gt;""I don't think you understand the definition of a team then. I only need one dispatcher today if you aren't going to make out bounds. So you can go home.""

A bit confused, was she asking you to do this for the day only or would it become a new responsibility?

I really hope you didn't quit your job over the former."
447,Sorry for upvoting over 666
448,Step 1: Give him a 5 star rating.
449,What the hell ? you mean your wife left left you?
450,NTA. You should break up with her.
451,"Could have been much worse if it was medical, they would have carted you off in the ambulance even if you said you were fine and then sent you a $10000 bill."
452,The first cheat code ever made.
453,You didn‚Äôt anything. If anything you helped the guy out.
454,Lmfao!
455,"You didn't ruin a marriage, she did."
456,She ruined her marriage not you.
457,Didn‚Äôt that trend already start with skinny jeans?
458,This is a great story. It would be average if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that your father was with you. I can see him now...lmao
459,[Whatever](https://i.vgy.me/i0EzVF.jpg)
460,Yes
461,That is awesome. Thanks for linking it. I am subscribing to the poopsock sub right now.
462,I rubbed my eye AFTER washing my hands after handling a regular jalopeno pepper for tacos.  Eye was inflammed for days.  I feel for you.  Hard lesson learned.
463,How long have you been married now?
464,"""When two gay men have sex, how do they knows now who's penis will open up to accept the other person's  penis?"""
465,Aight im gonna leave a comment here in case this blows up
466,"Consider yourselves lucky. Sex ed here in Romania is crap, unless an open-minded teacher takes time off from their classes and instead of the usual english or biology class (in my case at least) we do talk about sex ed. But it's nothing official.
BUT religion teachers (yes, in Romania there are religion classes, you can opt out of them tho) are militating against sex ed. They think it advices students to have sex. However they do not realize that some students are gonna do it anyway, AT LEAST they should have safe sex.
I hate extra religious people."
467,What makes that relevant? You posted after his 4th edit so you saw that she clearly knew what video he played 4 times before switching to porn
468,I will get checked for sure! And get oral swab for chlamydia and gonorrhea because I swallowed him.
469,You want a promotion? Break out the lotion.

Fuck me sideways didn't see that coming"
472,It was not me but I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not alone.

Oof"
474,"I think he did, and he's gonna be pissed when he finds out how much an ultra-sound machine costs."
475,Your life will not be determined by getting fired from a job that was poorly run and did not value your contribution. Chin up. I walked the fuck out of a pizza hut for the same thing. I had a new better job 2 weeks later. I'm only 24 and that pizza hut job didnt even make it on my work history list because it was so bottom of the barrel. You are a hard worker with the right motivations and will kill it at your next job.
476,You never know until you try
477,Basically the real life equivalent of /r/angryupvotes
478,That's the next line in the movie I think.
479,They were just holding hands and having kisses I'm sure.

You realize your SO made that same decision and they didnt pick you as the more important thing."
481,"Saved his life, she ruined the marriage. You did fine."
482,"Planes can arrive EARLY? Like do I have to pay extra or something like that? Or is it a express ""no security/maintenance checkup"" kinda airline or something?"
483,I would have tipped you and gave you 5 stars.
484,I don't see how that's obvious. They're saying that if the guy had never found out he might have lived a happier life. Which could very well be. That doesn't justify the woman's or anyone's behavior.
485,Maybe one last very hateful tip.
486,"In the end it is your decision, none of us can tell you what to do. We can just share our experiences with you and maybe help you ease through this experience. Thing is tho, we decide pretty much in the first 7 seconds after we meet someone if they are a potential partner or not. After that it is going to be a tough one to change the persons mind about it, specially the longer you know each other. Because for the person who is not interested in anything romantic, the other person will be put in the ""like family"" box in their mind. And if you don't live in Alabama, then you don't date family. XD"

488,Do you people not check the contact name before you send a text? WTF.
489,"You didn't fuck up, the wife did.  Glad you let the man know, might have saved him years of heart ache."
490,"A friendly reminder from a Safety Professional:  Doing dumb stuff like this at work has additional consequences other than the obvious bodily injury.  There are quite a lot of mechanisms going on behind the scenes that could have grave consequences for your company.  

As worker's compensation is used, the company's experience modifier increases.  This is an insurance premium multiplier.  Not only can this be costly, but may result in loss of marketability, as customers do not wish to be associated with companies who perform poorly.  I have seen this occur on two occasions.  

Qualifying employers are required to track their injury and illnesses and submit their OSHA logs online.  As mentioned above, customers want to see these in order to qualify your employer as a potential supplier.  Injury and illness tracking is public data.  Company's who perform poorly will have difficulty obtaining work and hiring good workers.

An serious injury such as an amputation event will most likely trigger a visit from OSHA inspectors. This isn't a bad thing for workers or employers, as the results of the visit can lead to a safer workplace.  That's a good thing.  But again, this information is public record, and depending on your industry, customers will avoid working with your company if you've had OSHA citations(especially in the last few years).  

On top of serious bodily injury, death, dismemberment and a lifetime of disability, you can also affect the lives of your coworkers and even your community by contributing to undesirable safety statistics.  Also now, your safety pro (if you have one) is going to be very busy with medical, insurance, injury reporting and injury investigations.  This hurts his his/her viability in finding jobs in the future.  He or she will not be happy about that.  Your company president will not be happy about the cost, additional training, and man-hours working on this event.  Injuries are costly in so many ways.  

This is not to scold anyone and believe me, I'm not Mr. corporate.  First and foremost, I don't want anyone to get hurt.  People should be able to go home to their family in the same condition as when they left.  But the second part of my job is ensuring that we all get to show up everyday and make money.  Sometimes fear of injury isn't enough to get people to stop and think about their actions.  Its important for people to recognize that it could all go away - for everyone - if someone gets seriously inured.  

Also, what the hell kind of a machine, potentially capable of amputation, has no guards?"
491,Yeah what was he thinking saving a man years of grief when he didn‚Äôt even think about the wife not having fun.
492,"You being the one that fucked up the marriage is like you being the one that made a spill by pointing it out. It's not Schrodinger's cat, it's been long fucked up and if anything you should have gone out of your way to point it out for the sake of the man that was likely getting cheated on."
