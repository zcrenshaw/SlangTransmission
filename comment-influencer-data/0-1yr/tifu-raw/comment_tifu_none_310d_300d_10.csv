1,"I thought it'd stop at the balls, but it kept going. "
2,"[That they've publicly said they reversed the decision](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-pot-industry-workers-border-1.4858534), and then do it anyway doesn't surprise me. If you feel like being a test case you could see if any legal groups have an interest with working your case."
3,"I don’t understand how school financial department operates this way. 
Two years they let you go in debt?

I attended multiple schools and each had about 2 weeks deadline to pay for classes at the start of semester. Classes aren’t paid? You get dropped in couple weeks. No negative balance nothing."
4,"YOU NEED TO LOCK YOUR SHIT DOWN LIKE YESTERDAY

It wouldn't surprise me one bit if in that batch of 900 people there are at least a few assholes who decide to steal your identity. Assuming this happened a few hours ago, you need to take action **NOW**

1. Get an identity theft PIN from the IRS - simple enough to do [right here](https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin) and I would say you qualify because 900 people now have your tax information.

2. Freeze your credit reports - This is free now and I'd recommend anyone who gets any information stolen do this, that can be done [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/free-credit-freezes-are-here)

3. Keep an eye on your credit **for years** - At some point, you're going to have to lift the freezes to get a loan or credit card or something. If you're moving, having a credit freeze can be a pain in the ass if you need a credit check for utilities, mortgage/rent, etc. Even with a freeze, if someone has enough personal information about you, they may be able to lift it themselves. You can rotate out each credit report every 3 months through [Annual Credit Report](http://annualcreditreport.com)

What you cannot do is to sit back and think it's going to be fine without doing anything. In all likelihood, it will be fine if you go through everything above, but if you just think it will go away in a month or two you're sadly mistaken.

**Edit** - I don't mean to scare you (maybe just a little bit) but this is a serious thing that can reverberate long after today.

**Edit 2** - r/StopIDTheft is where I'll be posting more about this. It happened to me once, it was a shitty 3 months but I learned a lot by studying up on what to do/not do. **[Here's a not-quite exhaustive list of resources that you might want to consider](https://np.reddit.com/r/StopIDTheft/comments/9wl7sl/links_which_will_help_you_if_you_get_your/)**"
5,From the title thought this was going to go way different
6,I'd say go for the buzz-cut and be reborn.
7,"You were thinking cum sock, weren’t you?"
8,"Don't feel bad. I once went to the wrong funeral. I wondered why I didn't know anyone, but once it started was too embarrassed to leave."

11,Then give them the dead-behind-the-eyes retail stare.
12,"&gt; He asked if I could have a look at it anyway 

There you go... you fell into his plan of showing you his wrinkly butt."
13,"You should see my hair right now.  I asked for a hard part, and the lady gave me a hard part, and shaved *straight down* all of the hair growing outwards from my temple towards my eyes.  

I wasn't wearing my glasses during the haircut, so I didnt notice until I got to my car.  Once I came back inside to ask ""what the fuck,"" the guy sitting in the chair hopped up and said, ""No thanks"" and left.  When one of the other barbers looked at me she whispered, ""Oh no... what was she thinking?""

My sentiments exactly.  I feel for you, dude.  I really really do."
14,That’s what she said?
15,"Because so many international flights will transfer in the US and transferring in the US requires going through immigration even when you just want to change planes, being banned from the US can have huge consequences. My wife recently flew from Ecuador to Dubai. She had to take the most roundabout expensive flight to avoid transferring flights in places she didn’t have a visa. Literally flew from Quito to Lima to Buenos Aires to São Paulo, and then to Dubai instead of the quick cheap flight with one stop in either Miami or NY. "
16,Yeah when I was in college they wouldn’t let you register without paying
17,Cum again
18,Well if no one else tells you. Good job on being sober it's tough out there!
19,"As a fellow penis owner, I can't comprehend the concept of walking around the house doing stuff naked. When I'm in comfy mode, I'm wearing either gym shorts or flannel pajama pants, depending on the season. I need that layer of protection for my junk. "
20,"That looks like a 5 year old, got a hold of some scissors...I'm sorry I would demand a refund, and have a new barber try and correct the cut.."

23,"My toddler daughters would of did a better job lol.

I don't know what the fuck he was thinking.

I did snap. I wasn't mean but I told him he's insane for doing something like this without asking. 

Unfortunately I can't imagine fixing it in a way that would be better. At least I can just comb over it but it still looks stupid as the hair is supposed to go the opposite way.

He didn't charge me.... So then I felt bad cause I'm not generally an asshole (except on reddit) "
24,"This is good advice, but one should always account for ones paleness beforehand as to not appear to be a cancer patient like I did for a summer. "
25,I was thinking an entirely different kind of toy.
26,"&gt; That they've publicly said they reversed the decision, and then do it anyway doesn't surprise me

The first words of the post: ""So in July of this year...""

The story takes place before recreational cannabis was legalized in Canada in October and before CBP stated that they'd ban workers in the soon-to-be legal cannabis business."
27,"I'm a university admin, and we withhold final marks and won't let you enrol in classes if you have ANY outstanding fees from year to year. Over due library book? No final marks for you! 

Its weird to me that they let this go on so long... unless OP just wasn't checking his school email account?"
28,"If this ain't the most wholesome thing I've read all week, I don't know what is.

Hope you get your toy fixed OP"
29,I think the horse was probably more unlucky than you
30,"While it is your fault for not checking FAFSA, it is arguably also the college's fault for not telling you about it sooner.

If they had told you that they weren't receiving money from you right when it started happening, then you could've had it fixed long before it reached this point.

I'd sue the college for that tbh. You fucked up, but they fucked up more. You shouldn't be the only one dealing with the consequences of this."
31,This doesn't make sense. At my college you cannot enroll for another semester without paying off the balance of the previous one. Either the fafsa in his school forgot to put a hold on his account or they totally forgot he didn't make the payments and then suddenly someone in the office realized and decided to pull this shit. Something is definitely off
32,You should have leaned into it and made a speech.
33,I was half expecting this to go on the route of child porn. Thank God it didnt

38,"Based on a quick Google search and a decade old memory, it looks like it was most likely a Saw-Scaled Viper."
39,"The tl;dr section made me chuckle if you read it without context haha.

I feel for you mate. As an introvert who had to take taxis to work for a few years I've had my fair share of wtf moments. Sometimes they get desensitised to keeping work and private life separated due to the nature of the job and most who want to talk genuinely just want a conversation. "
40,"Look, I'm not one to go all /r/thatHappened on every story ever, but this doesn't make any sense. CSU, CU, and MSU all have policies that if you don't pay your tuition, you can't register for the following semester, so it's not possible for you to have continued taking classes for a full year after failing to renew your FAFSA. Even if it wasn't one of those three, I can't imagine any of the other colleges in CO have vastly different policies. They all also send you to collections, so you would've been receiving collections calls long before the two year mark. There's either more to the story that you're not telling, or you made it up."
41,How much y’all wanna bet OP is actually one of those people who got the W-9 and real OP’s identity is so stole they even got his reddit account?
42,"The real TIFU is using boiling water with green tea. You monster.

Seriously though I hope your peener is ok."
43,Might be easier to exchange it at the store it was bought from since it's the day after purchase.
44,When you get older this exact same TIFU title will relate to a story where you go to pick up an actual sock and end up throwing your back out. 
45,"That son of a bitch owed me $2.83, and now he's fucking dead and I won't get my $2.83!"
46,"Yes, this thought crossed my mind as well. My story is way funnier if you think of it this way. "
47,"We may be accepting of racists, nazis,homophobes, and Russian spies, but we draw the line at people who work in retail."
48,"One of the worst TIFU'd I have read in a long while. I am sorry you are going through all this OP. Your public defender doesn't really sound too good either.. I mean you didn't write any bad cheques, so how can you get a felony charge for it? Or am I misunderstanding?"
49,A few weeks ago I made ramen and filled the bowl to the top. I wasn’t super smart and decided that instead of using oven mitts to transfer the soup to my coffee table where I could watch tv I would instead just use a paper towel in both hands. . . Which was stupid because as a small amount of boiling liquid spilled onto my hand the shock caused about a cup full to also spill. . .and there I was somehow in so much pain that I wanted to drop the bowl but was also lucid enough to realize if I dropped the bowl I would have to clean a broken bowl and deal with boiling liquid all over my feet. . .so I continued my walk with my hand shaking and soup still spilling over it. . .was fucking awful. 
50,Taint deep is the new balls deep.
51,"OP, get on this now if you haven’t already. "
52,"This was the weirdest part to me. They've already been having sex, so why does he need to impress her once again just for the sake of getting laid again?? "
53,Just picturing this I’m starting to feel like throwing up. That’s nasty. Were you ok?
54,"Not gonna lie... I was having a hard time  relating to this post until  i read the last part "" Sometimes very little things might mean a lot to some people"".

57,What kind of snake was it?
58,It is because this is a massive lie
59,"Damn. Was getting a semi trailer tire fixed, the guy had it laying on the ground abs was airing it up. I asked him a question and as he moved his head away from the tire to answer it blew.  Had I kept my mouth shut he could have been killed.

Safety takes less than a minute, but injury only takes a second.

Glad you weren't hurt worse OP! "
60,"Why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick? "
61,They shouldn't have let him register in the first place. 
62,"You thought you would get laid by telling her you were an engineering major??  Wow, things must be different now.

63,"Yeah, but what the United States publicly says and what it actually does are never in sync. "
64,That's some piss poor judgment by you
65,"Thefuck?! You need a Visa to just be in the ariport, in the boarding area? Why?? That person isn't going to randomly be able to leave the airport, why require a visa for that?"
66,"I don't think you were being an asshole at all. I would've been super pissed off. I also go for a hard part, and the barber did the opposite side leaving me with a colic."
67,"I'm working so I can't take a pic, but you know where your hairline is all across your forehead, and then takes a few distinct turns going down the side of your head leading to your sideburns? Imagine where the corners meet (where the hard part begins) and from that exact point, shaving straight down.  Or rather, imagine you're facing to the right, and draw a vertical line touching the right side of your sideburns, and shave all the hair connected to your head to the right of that line.

She turned my hard part into a perfect right angle of baldness.

Some of it has grown back now, but it still looks ridiculous as fuck.  I look like a 3yr old that tried to cut his own hair with a straight razor, and then had someone even it up on the other side to hide that fact."

86,"Cum sock, a sock used to cum in for easy clean up.

Also, I've seen ants eat the cum from cum socks on several occasions. Kinda interesting."
87,"Yeah, stating that your job was part of what was at the time a criminal offense really makes countries not want you in. I think any country would have done the same."
88,"Yeah, it's more than weird. A friend from India wanted to fly to Vancouver with a stopover in LA and got denied to board the plane - and the best part of the story is that she asked the US embassy in Delhi if she would need any visa and they told her she wouldn't. Man she was pissed. She needed to pay for a whole second flight in the end.

I personally had a similar problematic when I flew to Canada after having visited Iran the year before as that cancels all your visa waiver rights. "

I'm a 28 year old white male from the UK. I'm pretty stern, rarley show my feeling to anyone but close family and friends.

BUT! I actually did a little cry at this, like the rollercoaster of feelings. Reading how you treated yourself because you finally could to something you wanted as a kid. I related to this quite a bit, I know it's not the same but I didn't have the same as other kids, I wasn't terribly poor but people had better things and sometimes I couldn't have toys everyone else had. So when I got older and had a good job . I actually bought alot of the toys I wish I'd tried as a kid and it brought lots of joy.

But then to read how it broke! I was gutted for you, I tried to picture how sad you must have been , I didn't remember reading anything about you so I played it through a few times in my head  with you been Female/male and all the options! Which just made me sadder!

I hope that the younger generation, our kids if we have them, never go without but still learn to earn rather than just want!

I wish you all the best :)

94,"Fr I quit taking acid for about a month and I started feeling good about it and when I told my mom she said “a month isn’t all that long” it hurt but I guess there was truth to it.

148,"My grandmother, grandfather, and uncle all died within a three day period (independently; not in the same event or anything).  On the day of my grandmother's funeral, I received a call from my sister, asking me if I could pick her up from work to go to the funeral.  Sure.  No problem.  I picked her up and we drove the couple miles to the chapel attached to the funeral home.  We were hung up in traffic and struggled with parking, so we arrived just in time for the service to begin.  There were limited seats remaining, so we sat some distance from each other.

When the service began, the minister began the service by saying, ""We're gathered hear to celebrate the life of our dear departed Peggy.""  I glanced at my sister with a confused look, and she glanced back at me with a similarly confused look.  My grandmother's name was ""Mabel"".  The chapel was filled with my family, so I knew I wasn't at the wrong funeral...hmmm...OMG; the minister has his 1pm and his 2pm script mixed up!  I was convinced the minister had made a mistake, until the life he was describing certainly seemed like what little I knew of my grandmother's life.  Eventually, I determined that some people knew her as ""Peggy"".  Turns out her third husband, with whom I was not close, had given her the pet name ""Peggy"" and when they moved to his community, everyone, including her minister, knew her as ""Peggy"".  She always came to visit me, and so the name ""Peggy"" was unknown to me.

When the service ended, we were leaving the chapel when my sister turned to me and said, ""Did our grandmother die?""  You see, she had received a call from my father, who, assuming she had already heard of her grandmother's demise, had told her ""I just wanted to let you know the funeral will be on Tuesday at 1pm; see you there.""  My sister, knowing of her uncle's recent demise, assumed my father was talking about my uncle's funeral.  Nobody had told her that her grandmother had died.  She found herself at a funeral for some woman named ""Peggy"", also not knowing that my grandmother had a pet name.  We were half way through the service before she started to suspect her grandmother may have died.

TL/DR: My sister was at the right funeral, but didn't know who had died.

Also, even uni residence is beholden to landlord/tenant laws, they'd have to give required notice, and not kick him out on the spot. AND jobs on campus are not tied to enrolment or residence, so why did he get fired too? There's a lot here that doesn't add up."
