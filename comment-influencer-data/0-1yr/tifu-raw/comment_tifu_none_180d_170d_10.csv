And of they are an individual, then presumably the auto-dialer halts when they're on the phone, and will just pick up where it left off after the call is done.

The real solution to this problem isn't to waste their time, because their time is pretty worthless. The solution is to harass and waste your government representatives' time because they're the ones who can actually get momentum going to find a solution. Also your service provider needs to be made aware. The more complaints they get the more they'll do to address it. Even though they won't be able to do anything for specific cases, it will pressure them to invent some tech to solve it. "

I lived with 7 other guys who were all great friends, and we had a key code to our top floor apartment. One night during finals week I was at the library until about 1am studying. Under no influence but sleep deprivation, I tried to use our key code on the floor below ours. Obviously didn't work, kept trying and got frustrated. I'm thinking, ""the guys don't care if I just ring our door bell, they will understand."" So that's what I do, and some dude I barely recognized answers and gives me a weird look. I share this weird look and wonder what he is doing in our apartment. It dawns on me after about 10 seconds that I just rang the doorbell to another apartment that has 8 other dudes sleeping before finals. I stammer for a bit and the best thing I could come up with is ""You live here"" *points at him*, ""I live up there"" *points up*. Then I proceed to go up the rest of the stairs.

This entire thing isn't about protecting kids, it's about controlling our internet and what they want us to see, monitoring what we do and no one seems to care. They started this years ago with their shoddy porn filter. When not enough people signed up they made companies turn it on so we had to opt out manually (it was blocking reddit, but my ex could still access his normal porn sites), now it's on for all new customers and it still isn't good enough. I'm not sure why they're getting so bent out of shape over what porn people watch. Some things should be banned, I agree, but why not use the money they're wasting on adding extra police to the streets, give it to schools to better their education, fix pot holes, feed and house the homeless or any other number of things that need their attention and leave the damn internet alone. I'm not arguing for the porn, I couldn't give a damn about it honestly. I'm just pissed were losing our freedoms online step by step and most people just don't seem to care.

224,You would think that a modern phone company would have the resources to track spoofed call because they would need some way of communicating the faked number. I always assume it is through some sort of hacked VOIP. Maybe I'm wrong.

Can't block them because they pretend to come from a different number every time, and can't call back to complain because they're a scam and spoof their number.

Can tell instantly when it's one because of the background noise (and the fact that they always ask for ""Mr First name"" instead of ""Mr Surname"").

244,"I just don't answer my phone if it's not a number I know. If they really want to contact me they'll leave a message. When my phone rings outside of Whatsapp 99.9% of the time it's for PPI checks, insurance crap about me being in a car accident, silence on the other end or some sort of recording. The other 0.01% is Forbidden Planet calling me to remind me to pick up my comics because they've been keeping them far longer then they're supposed to for me. They know I'll come and get them, I'm just very rarely in town to do so. They're a really good store. "

350,"Okay, so wild theory time. They know they're doing something immoral, and that doesn't pass in the human adrenal system neutrally. Lying stresses people out, as well as guilt, and their brain is going to be banging alarms with adrenaline and cortisol.

So they're already on edge, and and even after several successes and a rush of duping delight, they're still always on the edge of an explosion.

I had this batman toy that was supposed to stick to windows, but mum didn't want it to leave a mark so I wasn't allowed to stick it to anything. My uncle decided to visit. He would have been probably in his early 30s and got the idea to stick the thing to his forehead. Well it stuck really well and we had a giggle. When he pulled it off, it left a huge red mark. Of cause I found this hilarious and proceeded to stick it to my own forehead, which left a nice red mark as well. My mum called us idiots when she found out what we had done. I had a red mark for a few days, my uncle did as well. "

Hell, even this year, in my French class, we had somebody enter a Quizlet Live as ""tetrahydrocannabinol""  (which, in other words, is weed)

386,"Former teacher here; Kahoot names like yours would [at most] get the class banned from playing any sort of games for a period of time. I usually just kicked them out of the game and made them make a new name.

Maybe explain how you don’t even know what that word means, and how it really upset and confused you, being called such a word by an adult. And the teacher then has to choose to reply with “no, I said it makes him LOOK LIKE a...” and the teacher really looks like a jerk. But this kid seems like a good honest middle schooler, and the teacher’s response may have been a bit emotional, but I don’t think it’s too unfair. I admire the kid for being accountable for his actions. "
409,Most robo calls switch to people after about 30 seconds or so in my experience 
410,"So...I'll assume you and the lady have known each other for quite some time, so one can safely assume she was aware of your fondness for German memorabilia and German history in general. Which promptly begs the question: Why bring her family, who are not fond of all things German, into the home of someone like yourself?

&amp;#x200B;

As whackadoodle as your antics are, I do not believe your GF thought this out all the way."
411,Always have a banana ready for a snack if you're gonna take the long way home. If ya know what I mean...
412,"I’m not that young, but using context, without ever seeing this word written on the internet, I assumed it was a class learning game app thingy, like quizlet.  I’m new to reddit, and I see a lot of “what is Kahoot?” Questions, and I don’t know if this is what the kids call “trolling” or if it’s some kind of run on joke? "
413,Definitely using this. Live in a Spanish speaking country so no one will ever find out 
414,Hope you did not leave the condom in the haste. 
415,One a scale of 1-10 of the weird shit a year 4 teacher hears in class daily this would rate about a 6
416,"I always enjoyed setting my kahoot name to my teachers name, made things more fun when the teacher is giving bonus points to the winning student and the winning student is the teacher"
417,"rarely do I laugh at these. your post, best ever!"
418,**T**(wenty-one years ago)**IFU**
419,That’s awesome! 
420,He probably plotted his vengeance on you for some time and then realized he never saw your face and couldn't find you. 
421,"""What characteristic word even sounds remotely to 'dork'?""

Was not disappointed. Thank you for the laugh"
422,"Teachers don't generally make that choice. They see a problematic behavior, decide whether to submit a referral, then an administrator decides the punishment."
423,Military time also doesn't use the colon but 24h does
424,Omg I JUST made a kahoot quiz for my class tomorrow and I just know they’re going to come up with some horrible names. I can’t wait though I think it’s hilarious
425,Plot twist: she really is 80. 
426,"Couple things, enjoy your day and reflect on your friends and decisions... Time we'll spent ay. Also is someone going to add link to kahoot from Google?"
427,[Don't worry you're not alone](https://youtu.be/keEIsXqCCGI)
428,"It became a thing my senior year in high school (thank you God not any earlier, or else me and my friends would’ve had 7 TIFU’s exactly like this a piece) and my US History teacher used it a handful of times, and as you know 98% of the time in high school history teachers are just dudes who want to be high school football coaches, so naturally he was fun to joke around with. We made a game out of trying to make the most inappropriate name, without getting rejected or yelled at. "
429,"There was a guy in my high school named Michael Hunt... he wanted to be called ""Mike"""
430,Haha. I actually checked that first. 
431,I can imagine it being so.
432,😂 Thank you for sharing! My drunk ass had a nice laugh tonight about this!
433,I’m gonna call BS on that. I pulled 2 days detention for getting into a fistfight in middle school. Why’s a kahoot name (that the teacher didn’t instantly kick anyways) buying 5 days? 
434,"Hey, back in 9th grade my friend got suspended, I kid you not, for high giving someone roughly. For two weeks.

The teacher heard a very loud slap, looked over, and started yelling at him because he thought he slapped my other friend. He sent them both to the Dean, but no matter how much they tried to explain they couldn’t convince the dean that the teacher was dumb enough to mistake a loud high five as a slap. 

"
435,Hunt is bulletproof. 
436,That's.... kinda sweet.
437,Wtf is a kahoot?
438,I don’t understand how this is a TIFU when it happened two decades ago.
439,\ take it 
440,"I dont feel like the victim anymore
YAY"
441,"Told my friend to have his name be “Gay = Sin”. Teacher got pissed and asked who made the name. She kicked him, and his address bar in his browsers covered the words telling him he was kicked right as someone walked by checking for who made the name. He got damn lucky that day."
442,"Said yes to weed; said no to crack.
Now there's glass stuck in his back."
443,[removed]
444,"You're a pedophile because you have interest in people your age?

FBI open up"
445,Nice
446,I got better!
447,That's exactly how I read it.
448,Ah the ol' I'm not a Nazi I just really like German history line.
449,How did she connect this to pedophilia??
450,"My little brother is in elementary school and has a bit of a dark sense of humor inherited from his  high-schooler brother. My parents got an email home the other day explaining that he had been punished for making his Kahoot name “My Dad Beats Me”. 

Man, did that warrant a talking to..."
451,You gotta go hard in HOI4. There’s no other way.
452,Howd the teacher even know? 😂😂
453,OP just got modus pwned
454,Here you dropped this! \
455,"My number got somehow sold I guess to a list of random solicitors. They just keep calling and calling, and the only solution  has been to actually pick up and wait through the spiel to get on the do not call list. 

Sometimes I answer, intending to do this, say hello... nothing. Repeat... wait.. then they hang up!

So it's just a random call with no result. Annoying AF."
456,"It's German humor, mate. It's no laughing matter."
457,"This story makes me think your teacher was one of those people who pronounces dwarf as 'dorf'. 

Which makes her a mental midget."
