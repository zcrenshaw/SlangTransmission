15,"&gt;**husband just told me he wants a divorce, so lost [GA]**
&gt;
&gt;Hello all, apologies if this is confusing, I'm still very raw right now. An hour ago, I checked my phone on my lunch break and there was a text from my husband that said that we weren't working out and he had to give up on us. He hasn't answered any of my calls and texts. I told my work I had a personal emergency and went home.
&gt;
&gt;I feel completely blindsided and heart broken, especially that he chose to do this over text, without even talking to me about it. We haven't had any major problems in the past. I'm 7 months pregnant with our first child. I need advice on what to do.
&gt;
&gt;When I got home, all his stuff was still here so I can only assume he's intending to stay. Legally, what steps should I take? Can I take our car to my parents house or do I have to leave it here? What happens with custody if I have the baby in another state? Do I have to let him into the hospital room? What am I allowed to take with me from the house? Any advice is much appreciated, thank you all. xx

&gt;edit: I want to thank everyone who responded to my post. It was so helpful to have some clarity in that moment, though it ended up not being necessary.
I was packing the car with clothes and such for the baby and me and my husband started calling me over and over, but I didn't answer because I was so upset. He came home and saw me packing the car and he started crying and asking what he did wrong.
&gt;
&gt;I kind of blew up at him because he had sent me a text saying he wanted to divorce! He told me he did not send any sort of text like that and asked to see the message. He looked at it, told me to hang on, and went to get his computer.
The text he had sent me said ""This isn't working, and at this point I think I need to just give up."" There was a first text that he had sent from his laptop that we discovered didn't go through. It said ""The new mirror came in! I'm going to try to put it together but I may need your help later.""
&gt;
&gt;So as it turns out, I'm not getting divorced and I'll probably be able to laugh about it when the pregnancy hormones let me stop crying. My husband helped me unpack the car and now he's out getting me Thai food, so there's a happy ending.
Again, thank you all for your kind responses. I'm glad I didn't need them! xx

Some context and details. We have been dating for 3 years at that point and living together for at least 2, so it wouldn't have been the ""we need a break"" chat, she is just bad at text messages. But there is an underlying feeling when you have had 6 breakups (with other girls) in the past (where she has left you) that will put you into panic mode when something like that is said.

It was an easy fix as well, the breaker was tripped so she just needed to turn it back on."

94,"Just an FYI there are two sides to a EBT account. Some people get what's called TANF (Transitional Aid for Needy Families) which is cash. When someone swipes a EBT card they get an option to select food (snap) or cash(tanf). Normally if you selected food and had non food items the register knows to automatically disregard those items. Cash can pay for anything except gambling items and alcohol ( though they can go around this buy withdrawing the monet from an ATM first). How they got you was that they had you manually put in the item, so now the register no longer has the automatic signifier to disregard it as a food purchase. Oh and this is also the case with hot prepared food, you can't buy that with food stamps. Your boss simply needs to report it if it was indeed the food side and the company will eat the costs of the refund. The USDA goes down hard on places that do it on purpose which is fraud, not accidental cases like these. In fact it's the customers that will get a strike in this case. 

You just got to be careful when you go from automatic scanning to manually entering stuff. Most grocery stores require an override in these situations to prevent these kinds of scams.

I used to own a jeep. Thing was great in the snow but a tank otherwise. I traded it in for a Mazda 3. Driving through a city I missed the exit I needed and took the next one and was doing a u turn. The road was fucky (Boston) so there was a median that had pedestrian signals. Long of the short, there were people waiting to cross on the median.

Nice day. Windows down. U turn a jeep wouldn't be able to handle. Mazda turning radius just fine so in my excitement I exclaimed ""tight like donky!"" as I was turning. And a girl out for a run in spandex got angry and flipped me the bird.

It does not act on wakefulness by influencing adenosine, but through its antihistamine effects in the posterior hypothalmus of the brain, where histamine release helps the brain achieve states of vigilance. 50mg is the normal therapeutic dose  for use as a sleep aid, not an unusually high dose as implied.

A few months ago I was on a train in Germany with my wife. Across from us was a dude wearing black skinny jeans and a dark hoodie sitting next to who I assume to be his girlfriend. Well, I‚Äôm gazing around, and an odd bit of color drew my eye to this guys crotch area. I soon realized that his (most definitely left) nut was hanging out and was in plain view. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice so I tried discretely kicking his foot. He looked up at me like ‚Äúwho tf is this guy nudging me from across the train‚Äù. With my hand in my lap I pointed at his crotch. He looked down and immediately covered his manhood with his hands. He tried to mouth thank you (in German) but not before his girlfriend noticed the commotion. She asked him what had happened and his face got really red. I tried my hardest to be serious but the pressure was too much. I was doing the whole quiver-lip-serious-not-laughing face. She asked him again more forcefully, and he gave up and straight-up told her that his ballsack was hanging out. I busted out laughing. My wife was previously unaware of the whole situation until then, so naturally she asked what I was laughing about. I looked at the guy, he shrugged, and I told her that his ballsack was hanging out. He laughed, she laughed, and his girlfriend laughed. It was one of the funniest moments and felt like it was right out of a comedy skit. That dude took it like a champ. I wish I had bought him a beer.

He hates that plant now, but I maintain the plant was a bystander.

2) He was watching two toddlers, and my godson who is older. They all wanted something from him at once. My godson asked my husband to pull on his arm as hard as possible, and my husband did, while trying to wrangle our two year old. Then my godson suddenly let go, and my poor husband‚Äôs own fist slammed at near full strength into his own eye. No rip in the eyeball that time, but a black eye.

That's really hard to do, since fraud in these cases requires you to KNOWINGLY act to GET something. So you didn't have a clue, and you didn't get anything out of the deal.

I've been a part of fraud investigations for government entitlements (from the government side). Nobody is going to waste time chasing this, unless the women pulling this off are doing it all over the place for thousands of dollars. Even then, the government investigators will be looking for them, not you.

186,"I was 18, a senior in high school.  I was also in the school's TV production class...we had a whole studio setup with a control booth and everything, and we did the morning news live every day. Well I was notorious for skipping class and just hanging out in the studio all day.  And having just turned 18, legal age to acquire adult novelties and such, I had just rented my first ever porn from a local video store.  

So I thought it might be a good idea to bring that freshly rented porn and watch it in the studio booth at school.  I kinda remember feeling nervous, almost euphoric about the whole idea of watching it there.  After we wrapped production of the broadcast that day, it was a Friday, the bell rings and the next class came in.  I popped the porn video in one of the empty VHS bays on the main control deck.  

I double checked to make sure the live feed was cut off so I didn't accidentally broadcast porn to the whole school.  That much was good, but....I forgot to check the in-class TV.  So off-camera, we had pretty much a classroom setup where students could learn about TV production and use the equipment for class projects, but the live production part was reserved for the first period class.

So, the TV used by the classroom portion of the studio was left on.  Popped the porn video in the deck.  And not too long after I hit play, I hear some laughing from the classroom side.  Not really putting the two together right away, I continue watching and even fast forwarding to the first good part.  More commotion out there, and then I realize what's going on.  I immediately hit stop.  My heart's racing.  The teacher walks in to the control booth... ""What do you think you're doing in here?!""  ....I say ""Nothing!  Nothing at all!""   And he says ""Well don't do it again!""

So now I'm just freaked out.  I scramble to get my shit together and get out of there.  Not realizing I had left the porn video in the deck.  The rest of my day was spent in anxiety, so it never even crossed my mind to make sure I took the video with me.  It wasn't until I had gotten home, after a nap, that I realized the porn was missing from my backpack.  And with it being a Friday, nobody was there at the school by the time I woke up.  I returned on Monday only to discover the porn was gone from the deck.  So now I had to explain to the video store that I lost a porn video.

tl;dr ... turned 18, rented my first porn.  Took it to school, watched it in our TV production studio's control booth.  The whole class ended up seeing parts of it.  Accidentally left the porn there over the weekend, and had to explain to the video store owner that I lost their porn"
187,"I used to work with a guy from Turkey who spoke pretty good English but didn't know a lot of slang words for things.  One day a few of us went for coffee and he got African red bush tea instead.

195,"Yeeep, this is why I don't arm wrestle (beyond the fact I'm not very strong). I have a vivid memory of being at a party in high school where a bunch of testosterone fueled dudes were trying to show how manly they were by doing an impromptu arm wrestling tournament while the girls were watching.

The ""finals"" consisted of the two beefiest dudes at school having a truly epic match. They were deadlocked for what seemed like minutes. Both of them glistening with sweat and rage. After a minute of the deadlock the party went quiet as everyone was mesmerized by the clash of titans in front of us. Only low, guttural grunts by the pair would occasionally break the silence. Their eyes locked as if they were reading each other's souls. 

One guy started to slowly turn the tide and started making progress. Veins were throbbing in both their foreheads. Suddenly there was a very noticeable cracking sound, following by an intense primal scream. Within a second everyone in the room was screaming and panicking. His arm was absolutely massacred. Dude was in a cast for a long time and IIRC had to get screws in his bone. 

Watching anyone arm wrestling just makes me cringe/wince."

I went back and gave it to them.  I was afraid they were going to call the cops and use the security cameras to run my license plate and I didn't feel like getting arrested over $20 worth of gas.  They were very appreciative.  They offered me a free soda but I turned it down."

He calls me out into the hallway to tell me that I was very lucky not to be turned into the Dean for plagiarism.

My GF likes to get me into a laugh fit, but 30 seconds in, when you really cant breathe, like you are suffocating, it is not fun anymore.
