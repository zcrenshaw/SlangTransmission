0,Sending pic of the condoms was a bit over the top.
1,your life is a sitcom
2,"Jesus dude, you could‚Äôve just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we‚Äôve gotten so close and I realised I‚Äôm interested in you and felt a bit awkward when leaving because I wanted to make a move and kiss you but chickened our‚Äù like... who sends a picture of condoms"
3,"Six months from now, OP: ""12 Hour Sudafed for $1 a box? Time to stock up!"""
4,"Tell him the truth.  All of what you explained.  Be sure to bring the real document you meant to submit and as him - as an adult, not as a simpering kid - if he would accept that you f'd up and take your actual submission for the class.  It can't hurt and in fact may be refreshing for him to see a student take responsibility for their own mistake."
5,Its not incest if you say no chromo!
6,This is my favourite TIFU in a longass time.
7,My wife constantly tells me that I'm basically a Simpsons character.
8,"Who sends pictures of the condoms you were hoping to use to a girl you haven't even flirted with lmao congratulations, you're about to be know as ""that guy"" in your friend group"
9,I'd love to get an update on how the next family gathering is going and if he changed his behavior.
10,Each day we stray further from the Lord‚Äôs light
11,The real tragedy is you sent a dick pic with the OwO on it.
12,"So we got poop knife, and now cum fork..."
13,I'm imagining a 50 foot receipt rivaling CVS automatically printing and curling up eventually forcing itself into a brick oven and suddenly lighting half the kitchen on fire
14,"As a teacher and a woman, you just say ‚Äútoo bad we are going to the bathroom!‚Äù They won‚Äôt know the difference!"
15,The uncle still being interested after the big reveal is the best part here.
16,How could I pass on such a great deal.
17,"Finally, a proper FU that isn't about mild embarrassment from sex. That was an entertaining read, you have my respect and sympathy."
18,Totally not acceptable. Confession is supposed to be private. If she confessed it should be between the two of them. Right?
19,"Yeah thanks for the advice man. I won't lie, I'm a mess so this is actually nice to hear some good advice."
20,"*""God's Plan"" softly plays in the background...*"
21,"Instant pots are great!

$10 would have been a give away.."
22,That's soap and dead skin. Any max strength drain cleaner will open it back up. If one comes with a long tool with teeth get it. That will help with getting the hair out.
23,At least it‚Äôs nice of them to cancel the order whist at the same time dealing with the fire you started
24,You made the mistake of thinking that OP has any social sense at all.
25,I love that the elevator went from terror to laughter in seconds. And that OP didn't think everybody was a dick for assuming they were all going to die.
26,Don't feel bad at all. Her dumbass fault for having loud ass cheating sex in her own apartment.
27,"Probably improved the smell in there, so his sacrifice was likely appreciated by the next person.  Even if they happen to notice all the paper towels are gone and in the bin covered in suspect fluid"
28,"The same guy who sulks in pictures and apparently doesn't enjoy hanging out with his ""almost soulmate"" if sex isn't involved.

Yikes."
29,"Holy shit, it doesn't work like that my brother"
30,Shoulda puked. Could have had a two-for-one fetish night.
31,"Professor: ""So....    .... where can you get me more of this?"""
32,"""A bee should not be able to fly, Its wings are too smal-""

""DARREN, ITS HAPPENING AGAIN."""
33,"Could have been worse....you weren‚Äôt wearing one of them were you, OP?"
34,"[real image of OP finding the scary school pervert (2019, colourised)](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)"
35,"Back to the ol' grind on Monday, eh?"
36,Was it worth losing your ball for a story this good?
37,"Yikes.

You could've told her the truth in a less creepy way. Like by not sending her pictures of condoms and bringing up your sexual frustration.

Perhaps mention you fancy her and you were frustrated in yourself for not making a move when you had the chance.

Live and learn I guess, better luck next time!"
38,It's a cat.  People need to chill the fuck out.
39,"Well, nice to know they will deal with these things."
40,And that‚Äôs when I would have gotten sick and ruined the moment.
41,This is a great story. Hilarious but also sprinkled with sadness. Trying times we do live in.
42,"The closeted part ain't weird... the ""are we still doing this?"" attitude is."
43,"It's not just that, everything from start to finish here was wrong. I'm going to assume OP is young, because these are all young man mistakes:

1 - The mindset. He says right off the bat that there was no legit flirting. Magically he assumes that because he gets an invitation to hang out indoors, it's on. That's a leap you just don't make if you know any better. Young man mistake.

2 - He chides himself for ""not making a move."" You make moves on someone you think is interested, and not only that, in this context, the making of said move seems to leave out any kind of leadup or framework. What was he gonna do? Close the YouTube window, grab a titty, and hope for the best? Young man mistake.

3 - When it was time to leave, OP gets one last chance to tell this girl what's actually going on, *and he fucking lies about it.* Talk about young man mistakes, that's a twofer! First, he's emotionally unavailable, and he's lying about it! To be fair, this is the least young man of his young man mistakes, because grown men do this shit all the god damn time. Still a mistake, though.

4 - This is the crowner. After blowing his chance to come clean at the door, rather than trying to play it off so he might have another chance later, he ruthlessly murders any future chance he might have had by confessing *through text after the fact.* Never mind the picture of the condoms, which is just idiotic icing on the cake. If you've got something important to confess to someone who actually means something to you, YOU DO THAT SHIT IN PERSON LIKE A HUMAN BEING WITH SOME SELF-RESPECT. Again, young man mistake.

In all honesty, OP has an entire thread of people shitting on him, but in all this shade is a metric shit-ton of actual wisdom, but the one thing I haven't seen anyone mention is the following question:

Did OP even really like this girl? Because ""we had fun together"" isn't the same thing. ""We got along well"" isn't the same thing. At the end of the post, his main lament is blowing his chance at getting laid, not the fact that he just murdered this friendship execution-style. I mean, the undercurrents of regretting that are there, and it probably factors at least a little into OP deciding to tell us this story, but it's pretty subtle, man. 

I hope he reads through this thread and takes some of the advice in here to heart, but not as much as I hope he actually learns from the experience. I was a young moron once, and believe it or not, I have absolutely done more cringey shit than this; I didn't have the internet to tell me where I fucked up, though."
44,"So let's get this straight ;

The company screwed the pooch and sent an offer letter with a higher dollar value than they realized, and fired YOU because you hit accept?

Did you leave a job to accept this new position?"
45,"Back in the 90s when the World Trade Center in NYC was first bombed (truck bomb in the garage for people that don‚Äôt remember) I was doing work for a company in one of the towers. It was only a few days after the bombing so to help lift everyone‚Äôs spirits I decided to bring a bunch of brownies in with me. I had them in an air tight metal tin in a large duffle bag full of paperwork. 

The express elevators in the towers were very fast and would make your ears pop from the rapid pressure change. Apparently it also makes air tight metal brownie tins pop. The tin opened with a loud metal bang and everyone in the elevator jumped. I don‚Äôt recall if anyone started crying but I know everyone was freaked out. After explaining it was just the brownie tin I ended up sharing them with the other people in the elevator to help calm everyone‚Äôs nerves."

59,"Seconded. Just herd them

60,You BIKED home on top of that?
61,"Honestly, probably the worst way to approach the situation. I'm sure there was a few things he could've done to gauge her interest in him; Netflix, wine, tickle fights, dancing, Twister, making a home cooked meal together, blindfolded flirty shenanigans, etc. But to send her pictures of condoms made it seem like she was a slut and didn't perform her slutty duties and it made him upset. I can see why she's upset with him. That move completely undermined any actual, genuine connection they may have developed. GL, OP."

66,"After 26 years on this planet, this year I discovered that it was in fact very weird doing on average 200-300 farts per day, and having countless nights of awful stomach pains after having milk or eggs. 

I did an intolerance test to discover i was very allergic to them both...

A few weeks after cutting them from my diet my  tiny little mind was blown into pieces when I realised I was averaging 3 farts a day.

79,The guy has two *seven year olds* that couldn't recognize him in a hat a sunglass for weeks.
80,"This guy hasn't even gone on a date with this girl and he's sending her a picture of condoms. He pretty much called her an easy lay to her face.

81,"I wonder how much homophobia bullying is secretly ""I fucking hate that I'm attracted to you."""

114,"You made a very fundamental mistake.

you mistook friendship for a potential booty call.

I mean, you admit that there was zero sexual talk between the two of you.  So, I'm guessing she literally had no idea you were interested in her, then you did nothing to broach the subject and simply passively sat there and waited for 'magic' to happen that would let you get some booty.  And then you got upset when it didn't magically happen and then TOLD her that you both wanted sexy time and yet didn't do anything to make it happen.  Not a hint, not a suggestion, nothing.

Yeah, this is a fuck up.

You need to immediately apologize and accept that she's not into you like that.  And let her decide if she still feels comfortable enough to be your friend.  If not, then congrats, you lost a friend because you didn't put in any effort to let her know how you really felt.  

You really did fuck up."

Maybe you're right but you can't just assume it's the semen that has coagulated in your drain.  Drains are disgusting and foul smelling if not cleaned regularly (particularly if you have long hair or live with someone who does).  It's kind of funny that your drain cleaning is wrapped up with feelings of sexual revulsion tho."

You can also use bleach, or peroxide, if you have a lot of it just sitting around. The important point is that it must be an oxidizing agent."

134,"Reminds me of a time in October or November 2001.  I'm at a combination barber shop and beauty salon in my college town on a football Saturday. This was just like the shops you see in the movie Barbershop, very Lively and talkative. At various points people were making comments about the size of the crowd of the football stadium so soon after 9/11. All of a sudden a very large jet engine seemed to fly right over the shop, probably a flyover for the game, but the shop went so eerily quiet for a whole 30 seconds before people decided to laugh after realizing it was nothing."

155,"In college somehow my apartment came upon a XXXL ultra-ribbed condom and as a joke we'd hide it in each other's stuff (like inside the pillow cover, in a box of cereal, etc) and try to outdo each other. Once I hid it inside my roommate's calculator cover--and I'm pretty sure I won the competition for the rest of the year.

It just so happens his professor forgot to bring his calculator to class that day, so who does he ask except my studious roommate who always sat in the front row. The professor opens the calculator lid and wham, in front of 100+ students a huge golden-wrappered condom falls on the floor.

She sounds insecure in her looks and possibly a bit naive. Maybe she even WANTED you to be attracted to her and was hinting at it by admitting she felt ugly (not something you can be sure about, but a possibility). Sending her a picture of condoms and lamenting not getting all up in that is like full acceleration headbutting someone that wants a peck on the lips.

224,"My brother pretty much did the same thing when he went to visit a girl (across the country) he was talking with.  They spent time with a group of friends, went to the beach, boating, etc.  He said she didnt seem too interested in spending time alone with him, that she hadn't texted him in the 2 days since he got back, and he couldnt figure out why.  I told him that was a bummer.

Jump forward a week and I am talking with my mother on the phone about it.  He failed to mention that her grandfather had died 2 weeks prior to their visit and her father was in the hospital.  He couldnt figure out why she didnt want to have sex with him as her family was dying.

They are doing a competition together next month and will see each other then, and he doesnt want it to be awkward.  So he wants to text her to tell her how he feels and that he doesnt want it to be awkward.  I told him that he shouldnt do anything like that.  He should have offered his condolences and told her he is there if she needs anything.  Then a week before the event, Express that he is excited to compete and that he has been training, etc.

Some people definitely forget that people are humans and dont want to be put on a pedestal, or on the flip side objectified.  They dont think about what they are saying, and that their words have meaning."
225,His problem was he was waiting for something romantic or cute to just happen that would've gradually developed into sexytime. Movies give off completely unrealistic expectations of funny/cute/romantic things just happening. They don't. At least not usually. Most of the time it's up to the the person that is interested to make a move. The smoother he/she is the less pervy it appears and more charming it comes off as. OP was probably just severely out of practice and let his raging boner get the best of him.

I dated a Mormon in highschool and it was the most stressful thing in my life. I was unaware of how extreme that church was and I knew she was devout but we did stuff anyways.

Once I caught on, I tried to respect her religious boundaries but it was already too late. She kept pushing the envelope further and further. Guilting me into having sex then crying afterwards.

One day, she couldn't take the guilt any longer and she went and confessed to her bishop. I was actually going to her church at the time because I knew this day would come and I couldn't let her confess without me or else the story would be twisted.

Well, the bishop made her confess anyways then called me into his office. He told me that according to her, I was the one that pushed the boundaries and forced her into sex.

So I broke up with her, never went to that church again, graduated and left."

At first I thought it was absolutely hilarious until I met one of the guys a few years later at a bar. He came up to me (mostly sober haha) and gave me the most heartfelt speech about how he wished he could've shown his true self to the world, how much time he wasted trying to craft an image that didn't exist, ect. It was extremely sweet and we talked about how being 'cool' in high school was essentially being broadly accepted by most people, and agreed that having people love you for who you are is the coolest thing you can do.

This is why some women are hesitant to build friendships with men because it can feel like they‚Äôre just trying to get laid, which is obviously what you were doing. This poor girl NEVER brought anything sexual up with you, never flirted, yet for god knows what reason you decided you should try and fuck someone who has given you zero reason to believe they would want to fuck. I feel so bad for her. She probably just genuinely wanted to hang out with someone who she thought was a friend and she ends up feeling used. You are not her friend if you would just assume she would want to have sex with you, and you‚Äôre definitely not her friend if you make her feel very awkward by confronting her with the fact that you wanted to fuck her."

336,"Reminds me of the time when I was in middle school and the school printer had an app (it was a Lexmark app and no one knew it existed since you‚Äôre supposed to use the computers to print). It was a really bad looking app and you were supposed to use an image to print. Since me and my friend didn‚Äôt have computers at the time we ended up trying that out. We go to the library and notice that the printer won‚Äôt stop printing and it‚Äôs printing quite rapidly too (to the point where it would almost shoot out paper). It doesn‚Äôt print the image but it‚Äôs instead a 2 line combination of random numbers, letters, and those Microsoft word emoticons. We realize that the app is broken and it doesn‚Äôt work. Whatever. Later on we get the idea that we can remotely ‚Äòhack‚Äô the printer to distract people. So we do a test in front of the librarian and try it. She panicked and cancels the process via a button. It had already printed like 40 pages (it‚Äôs loud as hell too). During one of those parent teacher interview nights my friend takes a paper, places it in the bottom tray, and curves it so that it acts as a ramp for the rest of the ammunition. I load in some random picture of the GTA V logo and then press print. The printer is rapidly shooting paper everywhere making a mess and a firework show. It was beautiful. Looking back it was pretty rude, we shouldn‚Äôt have done that."

When I was a little kid, my whole elementary school got put on lockdown because of a ‚Äúcreepy guy hiding behind the trees outside the school.‚Äù

That guy was my dad, who was waiting to watch my brother and I who had reportedly been messing around too much on the way to the babysitters house after school (she lived like two blocks down so we walked). 

They had some people come question him and pretty quickly recognized who it was because my parents were somewhat known amongst the faculty and staff since my dad was military and gone on trips a lot, and my mom was very outspoken if she thought ANYONE was treating her kids poorly. 

It‚Äôs pretty hilarious now, as this happened nearly 20 years ago before people were all up in hysterics all the time, but I‚Äôm still quite glad the school did that. They really cared about the kids. At least in that instance"

I'm a guy and even I know you're basically a piece of shit for thinking of a girl like a piece of ass like that and then sending her a condom? Like what the fuck? You're not having sex for a long time with this kind of casual attitude. Pro tips girls don't like to be told how unhappy you didn't sleep with them you are.

The stuff not behind the counter is Sudafed PE and contains phenylephrine which has been shown to be no better then placebo in multiple studies. So if you need actual relief you need to talk to the pharmacy.
