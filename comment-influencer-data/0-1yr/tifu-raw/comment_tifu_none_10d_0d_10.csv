0,Also dude. The amount of red flags in this story is frightening.
1,"Am also dude, am also appalled at the entirety of this fucking story."
2,Am too dude. He almost certainly cheated.
3,This... and he's a massive asshole for using it as leverage to get you to do something you didn't want to do on the way out.
4,"A dude I am also, that guys a piece of shit, definitely think he was cheating."
5,And he raped her on his way out... Nice...
6,"Dude is gaslighting like hell.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that he exploded with anger when you ask (for the first time) whether something is up between him and the woman is such a massive flag on it's own."
7,He pretty much used their relationship to blackmail her into sex. And then dumped her once it was done. Classic user behavior.
8,"She was *actually* raped. Not pretend raped. 

See an attorney immediately and get him thrown into prison. 

He is 100% fucking his side squeeze, too."
9,Specifically what this guy says. Leveraging emotions for sex IS abuse.
10,"Also a dude, am I. Think he is cheating too, I do."
11,"This. I was all ready to read this fuck up as her being hyper-jealous or whatever. She should say ""you're right, babe, I'm sorry I was wrong about you being an adulterer. You're really just a piece of shit."""
12,Marital rape is real and this is an example if what it looks like.
13,"&gt;This... and he's a massive asshole for using it as leverage to get you to do something you didn't want to do on the way out.

This is classic abuser behaviour. Emotional manipulation with no care for the feelings of your partner. GTFO"
14,"Am also dude, not even sure this is rape “fantasy” tbh. This sounds like straight up rape.

This is super fucked up."
15,no problem with my chowder cannon after getting the snip
16,"I'm not appalled by the story, but I am appalled by her husband's attitude and behaviour."
17,Are you serious? Do you think it will improve with time? That’s kind of one of my top attributes that I’d hate to lose
18,"Feeling cute, might go to the dentist later."
19,"News flash, coercion isn't consent."
20,"Seriously, normal dudes don’t react that way. My wife asked me if anything was going on between me and a female friend of mine once, and all I did was reassure her nothing was going on, and I also came up with the idea of not hanging out with this friend without either a sizable group or my wife present, because my relationship with her means more to me than any other relationship I have. 

When you have nothing to hide, you open yourself up to more scrutiny, you don’t furiously shut it down."
21,Trying to sculpt her body 'as he suggested' was the first tip off.
22,I was so confused as how he got poo poo on his digits after fingering her (presumably in her vagina)- like did the vigor of his thrusting somehow help the poo travel from its source?also the thought of poo in the wrong hole... NOPE. this theory makes more sense.
23,"To add to this, his reaction is pretty typical of someone who is actually cheating, but confronted without proof.

There's a lot wrong with this relationship, some may be her fault, but we've not been given any info to show that, however clearly there's a massive issue with him."
24,"Dude here too, and the attitude of the exhusband (please divorce him) is the worst and no one should behave in that way."
25,"He’s a cheater , trust me he has done it more than once too. He finally found his out and is trying to pin it on u and make u look like the bad guy. Judging by his behavior and his extremely odd sexual request I think you should sign those papers fast as possible and run, he sounds like he has mental problems."
26,"Timely story, as I just had mine done yesterday at 9am. 

I washed the family truckster yesterday at noon, and just finished up a day's worth of hurricane prep. 

10/10, should have had it done 10 months ago."
27,"Yeah, you definately caught him. Just the fact that he got so defensive is a big red flag."
28,"Agree entirely, but even if he didn't chat the behaviour you describe is bad enough for you to be well rid of him."
29,File rape charges on the way out.
30,"Also dude. He basically raped her, what the fuck"
31,"I've had a vasectomy, no change in volume or distance for me. I never experienced anything like OP and mine was done by an 80 year old doctor with shaky hands. The first round of shots didn't numb me up enough, so they had to give me another round which was unfortunate. They also didn't send in my prescription for pain meds on a Friday, so I went the whole weekend on just over the counter pain meds. Turned out fine though. 10/10 fully reccomend."
32,Yea that's fucked. That alone is grounds for leaving his ass. I mean his reaction to being called on the cheating is a giant red flag. But weaponized sex? That's some psychopathic level coercion  there.
33,"seriously, what the fuck op? my mouth is literally wide open after reading this. that's fucked up, and what you accused him of honestly, is not even that bad. any reasonable spouse can have suspicions, and it's best to be upfront and question it so they can bring the accusations to rest. yeah, what the fuck."
34,PSA: COERCION IS NOT CONSENT.
35,Rape fantasies are actually pretty common. What he did went beyond fantasy
36,Not just that but if you have somone that is having you change how your body looks specifically and will get upset if you gain a few pounds or somthing. Somone that caught up in vanity 99% chance of extramarital affairs moast vain people i know could give a fuck about sanctity of relationships or marriage
37,He's cheating on you and looking for a reason to divorce you
38,This sounds like it would fall squarely under 'rape by deception'.
39,"Shit, I already have my third ""miracle"" due this week. 

When she says schedule the appointment, SCHEDULE THE APPOINTMENT."
40,"&gt; Rape is forcing sexual intercourse or contact without consent

So maybe you should read op's post a second time. She said by the end of it she didn't have to even pretend it wasn't consensual. So, it wasn't.
She had agreed to it but without a safe word or anything of the sort she had no way out of it anyway."
41,"You weren’t that loud, as soon as I took the glass away from the wall I could hardly hear anything"
42,Yup he was 100% cheating(also dude) his reaction gave it away.
43,"Yeah holy shit this was hard to read. What a fucking dick, sex isn't supposed to make your partner cry. This guy is guilty and has issues."
44,"Am dude also, this sounded like the first little red flag here:""I have been trying to sculpt my body as he suggested...""  
I'm hearing demanded of me. Am I the only one?"
45,I'm a gay male who doesn't have much experience with vaginas and even I was wondering the same thing
46,"Honestly I think the story is real but it was menstrual fluid, he wasn't sure and got the idea it could be poop in his mind, and then got freaked out by it."
47,"Am also dude, advice would be top just throw the whole damn relationship away."
48,"Dudes, there is now officially four dudes that see much larger issues than a lack of faith here."
49,jesus christ that wording
50,Stand still. I’m almost there.
51,"OP's experience is far from representative so don't get too worried, for every story like this there's tons of unexciting successful vasectomies that only lead to worry-free and condom-free sex with no pain or weird stuff going on."
52,"Or, more to the point, don't fuck him"
53,"Scalpel free vasectomies they do now are much different... also sounds like this may not have been a great urologist.

Should not have to get wife’s consent.  That’s pretty back water.

Should have been told to expect red for a few weeks.  Is normal.

Should have been told to refrain for normal operations for minimum 2 weeks.

***Should have been told it can take several months for the stragglers to clear the trenches and pregnancy is a significant risk for minimum 3 months after, easily longer and they should go in for at least 2 sample inspections to confirm the trenches are clear - took about 4 months for my stubborn bastards and 3 sample reviews***

Find a different urologist- r/childfree has a really good list of who won’t destroy your junk.  Picked mine off of there.

I drove myself home after my vasectomy and was back to work the next day.  Tylenol and Advil are all you should need but get the man a steak and a bag of frozen peas, you’ll be a hero"
54,"This is precisely what I was going to say.

First day period blood looks exactly like poop. Girl was just on her rag and probably didn’t want you all grossed out so licked it off.

Still kinda gross. But way less gross than shit."
55,"This story makes no sense for it to be shit. He wasn’t banging her asshole, so there’s no way that he’d have gotten it on his fingers OR his dick. Kid doesn’t know how female anatomy is laid out."
56,"This. That’s where I got lost on the story. When he mentions that I had to scroll back up and I’m like... your fingers were in her vagina, no? There is no way that was shit. The sheer volume I’d assume you’d need to get it from asshole to enough to coat the inside of the vagina (I’m so sick just thinking about this) is just... not remotely possible without her being mighty aware and at that point it’s going to be all over the bed and her and just... no."
57,You didn't fuck up. You caught him. This is textbook. Do not fall for it.
58,"Specifically, don’t ‘let him be amicable’. Amicability was thrown out the window when he used an opportunity to force a rape fantasy."
59,thank you. someone had to say it
60,"&gt;She was actually raped. Not pretend raped.

Clearly something she wasn't comfortable with.  
Clearly pushing the boundaries WAY past what could be normal in a healthy relationship.  
And blackmailed into it.

I'd absolutely take any evidence that I have of the blackmail to the police... dude took the situation and used it to his advantage to coerce (so, yes, still 100% rape)"
61,He’s a garbage human who raped you. None of this is your fault. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
62,"I am a guy.  I am married.  I am very outgoing and talk to lots of people,  My wife and I both train at a HIIT studio of which the membership is probably 80-90% women, the rest men.

If my wife, at any point, said ""You seem to be rather friendly with &lt;soandso&gt;"", my **first and only** responsibility would be to comfort her, explain nothing is going on, and do whatever I can to make sure she does not feel that way again.

What this prick did was the 100% opposite of that.  The only way I'd respond like that is if I wanted a way out and used this as my opportunity - regardless of whether or not I was cheating.

The anal sex thing - nobody should do that to anyone that they ""love"" (forcing something the other does not want).  If you ask, and they say ""no"", that should be it.

Yeah this sucks, but you will be much better off without him."
63,The hardest part is that she blames herself. She needs some solid friends to step in and tell her she is in the right and that he’s a prick.
64,That's the most American thing I read today lol
65,"Period for sure. 

You’d smell shit covered asshole the second she walked in....there was a kid in 5th grade who didn’t wipe, teacher would put air fresheners under his desk."
66,blackmail for sex acts is 100% rape.
67,"I have to agree, he is cheating.  And that he used it to get you to do what you wouldn't have otherwise done is despicable and depraved.  It took me many years of my ex-husband's denials for me to realize that, unfortunately, they were all lies.  He was telling me he loved me more than ever while plotting behind my back.  Get a good lawyer and make sure to keep records of his behavior and records of your finances.   The quicker you get rid of this scumbag, the sooner you can start to heal.  Good luck!"
68,Yeah. You caught him cheating. That is not the behavior of a loving innocent husband
69,"This dude is fucking someone else. 

Make sure your lawyer catches him with her. Then you can railroad him in court.

He sounds like a piece of shit. You'll be far happier without him."
70,How would he be getting shit on his fingers OR dick in the first place when he’s fucking her vagina? I don’t think this kid actually understands female anatomy.
71,"Yeah, holy shit. If you ask him if something's up with him and another person and he explodes, he's definitely fucking around on you. If nothing was going on (and he wasn't a piece of shit), he would reassure you and ask what he did to make you think that, try to be accommodating, etc.

On top of that, he leveraged his outrage into raping you. He forced you to choose between being divorced and doing something sexually that you did not want to do. That's rape, plain and simple. And then after he raped you, he went ahead with the divorce anyway.

Your husband (hopefully soon-to-be ex husband) is worth less than fossilized dog shit. I'm so sorry you were abused and lied to like this and I hope you know that you deserve *far* better than him. Fuck that degenerate scumbag."
72,Iam dude
73,"&gt; 80 year old doctor with shaky hands

yoikes"
74,"Am dude. Know other dudes. Dudes don’t barter forgiveness by demanding rape fantasy. You two have major issues, the least of which is whether he cheated or not."
75,"My vasectomy last November: 

The doctor and nurse were really hilarious and we joked around while they painlessly cut into my reproductive organs. My wife bought me some comfy underwear and pajama pants and I gained five pounds while I sat on the couch playing RDR2 for the next week. 

It was the best week I’ve had since my children were born."
76,Do they just stand on your sack and hope it neuters you
77,Take him to the fucking cleaners...
78,Dont want any hurricane 'miracles' huh?
79,"Relevant PSA: I've heard that after a vasectomy, there can still be live/viable sperm hanging out in the rest of the tubes downstream for a while (I forget exactly how long, ask your doctor). So until that period has passed, if you don't want the thing that you got the vasectomy to prevent happening, keep using another form of birth control!

Just because you got a vasectomy the day before a hurricane, does not mean you can have unprotected sex with no risk of pregnancy during said hurricane."
80,"Am dude. This is rape, this is a super fucked up story, he definitely cheated."
81,"I don't believe being coerced into consent counts as actual consent, but it depends upon your countries laws on it."
82,Because it's annoying seeing it everywhere.
83,"He's obviously cheating on you and is a trash human being for coercing you into ""making it up"" to him."
84,"He also set up the perfect defense for himself when raping her: creating the 'pretend you're saying no' scenario ahead of time. Then when he \*did\* hurt her and she \*did\* want him to stop, he couldn't get called out for it as they'd previously agreed to her saying no anyways."
85,"This is like waving at someone who you think is waving at you but isn't, but holy shit so much worse."
86,Because they make stuff up on this thread to gain useless Internet points probably lol.
87,"Excellent defense tool, someone attacks you and you shoot a bloody load at them, guarantee most people would leave this person alone."
88,"The dude is straight up manipulative and abusive. Abusers tend to leave their victims once they have mentaly broken them but i wouldn't be surprised if he came back and ask to not divorse, and use that as leverage to manipulate OP further."
89,"This a weird a one because she originally consented but immediately got out of hand. I think he obviously came up with this ""fantasy"" to cover for the rape. This was definitely rape."
90,"Correct, it was vaginal penetration"
91,Teletwerking* Ftfy
92,“The only way I’ll forgive you/hire you/pass you is if you have sex that you don’t genuinely want with me” is rape.
93,Imagine drawing a firearm because a light turned on. Jfc
94,Or fuck him with strap-on in the ass too. So he would know how she felt.
95,"Yea, he outright coerced her, and that was not cool."
96,"Nah, what this guy experienced is not common, or is unrelated. I got a vasectomy, and it’s all good as usual, this guy had a weird experience."
97,"Break his arms! Hurry, quick!"
98,"thank you for pointing that out. what OP was put thru was 0% ok, and it terrifies me how many people in the comments fail to grasp that"
99,"That's enough reason for me to not do it.

Showering my girlfriend in semen is one of my favorite things in the world"
100,"She texted me late last night and said “just cleaned them, they look good as new!”

But I was absolutely ready to buy her a brand new pair"
101,Manipulating someone into consenting isn’t real consent. He manipulated her into saying yes by threatening her with their marriage so it was rape.
102,"I was wondering when I'd find this.  I've gone raw with girls on the rag before, but that's a no-go with a total stranger.  As for all the people grossed out over her sucking her period blood off his dick- it's her blood.  Not that big a deal.  Less gross than girls who go atm and that's far from a deal breaker for me.

She realized what was going on and cleaned OP up and finished him without so much as a pause.  Learn to appreciate a girl who will stop at nothing to please your dick regardless the circumstances.  They're the real MVP's."
103,"They shouldn’t do that to anyone, period.  Love or not.   It’s not a rape fantasy - it’s fucking rape."
104,"I mean any blood will turn brownish when it’s drying too. And the flakes he mentions... sounds like the way menstrual blood dries to pubes, right? And I can buy menstrual blood not really smelling very strong especially when mixed with lubrication and other sex smells. If your face isn’t literally in, u could believe not smelling that. Shit on the other hand...

And her own lack of surprise would suggest period. Plenty of people don’t think much of having sex during their period (personally I’d give my partner a heads up at least!) but I massively struggle to imagine anyone being utterly nonchalant about shit. Especially a college aged girl? I don’t think anyone escapes the self consciousness and body image issues at that age. Especially if you’re actively partaking in the hookup culture of college. No fucking way do you just casually become “the shit girl”."
105,Sexual coercion: it’s not consent if you have to threaten/blackmail/manipulate someone for it.
106,This is the only theory. This is the truth
107,"&gt;	haliorus

You tried, bro"
108,"This is the obvious truth. I'm expecting most of the other comments to be cheerleader, ""You deserve better girl!"" (which she obviously does as he sounds like an absolute asshole), but there's obviously a whole Easter bunny of other stuff going on here."
109,"You can't know they will not do proper construction.

I was in a place - modern family houses too - where, I shit you not, I could hear the other person ON THE NEXT HOUSE washing his teeth. Brush going back and forth.

Gargling.

Let's not mention the loo..."
110,Ex did the same to me. Most degrading and disgusting thing. Manipulative behavior. He’s most definitely cheating! Ex even told me I could keep the kids full time and he wouldn’t fight me if I served him in bed and did it whenever he called for it. Told him to F off! sick behavior.
111,"Feeling cute, might mouth bonk later."
112,"And the sheer amount of poo it would need to be to be all over his fingers post vaginal fingering?!?! I’m mega disgusted just thinking about it but I mean given both the thrusting and lubrication, I’d assume a small amount of poo would uh disappear. It certainly would take an awful lot of shit to literally coat one’s hand. And while he’s claiming it was dried or whatever uh... you don’t coat your hand with dry shit. It haaaad to be menstrual blood."
113,"So glad there was no Reddit in 2004.

Also a father of three, also married for 26 years now, also had my vasectomy in 2004.   If I had read this before that happened I surely would have cancelled the procedure.

(btw, I had some discomfort in one ball for a few weeks, but I wasn't shooting out rust or orange slurpees and no extra balls either)"
114,"This should be higher up, but everyone wants to say he's a huge piece of shit. He wants a way out of the marriage and is wanting to make it amicable for his sake not hers. He doesn't want her unveiling all his cheating and how he's screwing her in more ways than one."
115,"Dude there'd no relationship experience needed to see how big of a piece of shit he was. 

It's like the caricature of an abusive character you see in movies, the one where the audience goes, ""damn that's unrealistic..."" Only, it's real life now."
116,I don't think that's a fuck up.. sounds like you were WAY more considerate than a lot of people when staying in hotels.
117,"Hire a really, really good divorce lawyer ASAP.  Document all your assets right away- make copies of everything you can. Print copies of the balances in your bank account today. 

From the few details you’ve provided, he sounds like a very nasty person, and you need to be protected.  This is not about you.  His behavior is not normal."
118,"My Dad was convinced I was stealing his pot, (he grew 40-70 plants a year, every year, for the last 40 years), and would try to trick me into convicting myself.  I told him numerous times I didn't smoke pot, sell pot, and had no interest in pot.  Finally, he caught my sister stealing his pot to sell.  I think maybe he still suspected me a bit, but I never stole his pot.  I stole his heroin all the time, but never his pot."
119,"Yo u/falcia

&gt;There was no way he would have known it was me because I crop my face out of all my photos online to keep my privacy,

Does this mean he jerked off to your voice and cropped photos of your body? 🙈"
120,"From my experience, anyone who will react in that manner when confronted with potentially cheating most likely IS cheating. While I obviously don't know how you brought it up (as to if it was tactful or not), there shouldn't be any reason for him to react that way unless he was afraid of having to be responsible for his own actions. 
Secondly, there should be no reason for ANYONE to leverage sex against you, no matter what. Especially in an abusive, painful way that you're obviously uncomfortable with. That is undoubtedly manipulative and, honestly, fucked up. 
He seems to have an excessive ego trip and will absolutely control you to get what he wants. 
You deserve better than that and it seems like you will be infinitely better without him. 
Take care of yourself first."
121,"Are you over 30? Idk, I feel like things get less gross the older you get. My boyfriends at 18 reacted WAYYYY different than my partners in their thirties."
122,"Yeah that wasn't a rape fantasy, that was rape."
123,I think she should regardless. I’m reading this and it sounds—it sounds like rape.
124,Yeah I get the feeling you weren’t wrong.
125,"“Can you sound like my niece” -OP’s uncle, definitely"
126,"&gt;not following the orders given.

""So you have chosen death."""
127,"""I told him I’m ready and consented to his request for anal and to pretend it was not consensual during sex""

""I didn’t have to pretend I was sobbing because the experience was not enjoyable for me one bit""

She's saying it right here. She didn't even have to pretend it wasn't consensual = it wasn't. You can look at it any way you want, even if she agreed to do it, by the end she felt it wasn't consensual, so it wasn't. Seems like they didn't even discuss a safe word or anything to make it stop, and anyway she was tricked into doing it. Sounds like rape to me."
128,"That technically makes it sexual assault- you'll have to be careful and do it soon, because the more time that passes the harder it gets to persecute him in any way"
129,"Yup.  Came here for the post, stayed to say this in the comments.  

Oh, and if he's not cheating on you, do you still really want to be with someone whose fantasy is rape?"
130,"Yeah, it's also rape by coercion."
131,You’re better off without this gaslighting asshole. “I won’t forgive you unless you serve my every need in the bedroom” and then continues to make an issue. Disgusting.
132,Because it’s annoying seeing it everywhere
133,"Perfection is in the minor details

134,"Oh please, like nobody in that family plays a little 5 on 1, feeding the ducks, spreading free literature, mixing a batch, scratching some records, flicking the bean. This dude needs to get over it. Like yah dog, my productivity is up 38% since I started rattling my knees in the shower LOL"
135,"Or do it on Maury as a reveal show ""Siddhartha, you ARE the father!"""
136,"So what you’re saying is that your (ex)husband is a manipulative prick, who has been caught cheating and has now convinced you you’ve done something wrong and then raped you. Get out while you have the chance."

138,"I had this for a year. Sucks for the kid. Still, imagine having to go to work everyday and smell kid shit. Honestly wanted to quit. I'd call cps to force baths... But the smell would be back days later."
139,"&gt;but I just can't see this as forcing someone into something, which is the definition of coercion.

Actually [the definition of coercion is using force *or threats*](https://www.google.com/search?q=coercion&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS835US835&amp;oq=coerci&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l3.4366j1j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8) such as “I will never forgive you unless you perform this sex act you do not desire to engage in.”"

142,It's been 15 years dude...
143,This was my senior quote
144,Essentially it’s what could be considered rape by blackmail/ coercion.
145,"This is the version in going with, mostly to make myself feel better."
146,I feel so much better now thanks
147,Because when they take this much time making a story up they want you to read it
148,Sounds like you really muffed up.
149,oh gosh that poor girl! did you end up replacing the shoes?
150,"Spot on. 

A normal person would comfort his wife for being paranoid, tell her she has got nothing to worry about and move on with his day."
151,Started as a hard on. Swiftly became a hard no.
152,Yeah dude here
153,"The pranks were not equivalent.  

Proper revenge might have been the call and the jump scare, not a week long campaign involving convincing her she can trust you only to show she can't."
154,"It feels wonderful being able to nut without that nagging fear of spending the next 18-20 years locked into raising crotchfruit. My V was almost 20 years ago and my youngest is 22 now so I am too old for that life.

As for the physical feeling no difference at all that I can tell"
155,I laughed way to hard at this. You should assert your dominance and just plant it on the kitchen table. Right in the center of it.
156,Yeah and you wouldn't get shit on your fingers from sticking  them up a vagina. Op needs to learn female anatomy. And the ring around her asshole was probably just her asshole... women have hair and dark areas around their poop hole.
157,Just say you fell off the chair and hit your bum hard. If they ask.

159,I don't think OP knows where poop and pee comes from on a girl.
160,"Taking everything we've been told at face value, I think she should if it's proven he was having an affair with the instructor."
161,"Dude here, 100% sure he's cheating. 
He's an ahole"
162,Explains the ring too
163,Should have just kept sticking hearts in that guy for another 100 years.
164,Nice. A Princes.
165,"Generally low risk.  This sounds more like the (horrifying) exception to the rule.

Fun fact...it's rare, but sometimes the tube actually grows back.   Happened to a neighbor of mine, had an unexpected arrival to the family some years after his procedure.  :)"
166,"This! 

You didn't do anything wrong, he did. 

He clearly abused you and then raped you. 

I hope you get out there without even more damage. 
Maybe it's a good idea to get some counselling for yourself?

Stay strong and don't forget you are the victim in this scenario. He made you the victim because he is an abuser.

YOU DID NOTHING WRONG!!"
167,"&gt; They're probably pretty damn vanilla themselves.  

Or they're repressing their kinks themselves. Men and women aren't that different. 

Be open and honest with your spouse, let them know what you're into. Maybe they don't want to share that, but keeping it bottled up and repressed isn't going to do the relationship any favors. If they divorce you merely because you talk about something kinky, its not a sign the relationship was great to begin with.

My wife and I were both pretty vanilla when we got married, but we explored our kinks together and it's been a hell of a good ride. There are things we're each into (though nothing super strongly) that the other doesn't like, and we talked out the why's and hows."
168,Get Jerry Springer involved and all the gods are claiming it's their miracle... Fistfight ensues.
169,"He body shamed you under the guise of working out together would improve your relationship.

You ask him if he's cheating and instead of reassuring you, he uses it as leverage to make you perform sex.

When you agree, he performs sex in a way that you didn't consent to.

He raped you.

My mother was a badass divorce attorney. When I read this I heard her in my ear saying, ""Get mad girl and get EVERYTHING. And make sure nothing in your divorce settlement prevents you from seeking to criminally prosecute this absolute piece of shit to the letter of the law""."
170,"I've never heard anyone say ""washing their teeth"" and I am uncomfortable. 

I'm going to assume it's because you aren't American and I am uncultured."
171,"or...


WHAAAAAAAZZZZUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPP"
172,"This is exactly what I was going to say

First day period blood looks exactly like poop"
173,ah yes and it has the form of a hand lmao
174,I'm willing to put money down that he made her disconnect from all her friends. I'm actually certain she has no one she can confide in.
175,Why is this downvoted?
176,"Personally... I'd have trust issues with my SO after that?

The prank itself - the call followed by a brief insistence it wasn't you - no worries.  I might be irritated but I'd end up laughing about it.

But actually *convincing* me that it wasn't you?  For days?  There's a difference in saying it wasn't you and going the extra mile to be convincing and then perpetrating it despite seeing how it affects the other person.

One is funny.  One leads to the other person realizing that they shouldn't have trusted you.  Unless you have a mutually agreed upon love for this type of thing... yeah.

You're probably not single?  But if my SO did this we'd have to come to an understanding if we stayed together, and odds are that it wouldn't happen.  I don't blame her if she realizes she can do better than you."
177,"Oh okay, perhaps another time then -2 👎"
178,"Right, I had to “flush them out” daily for a couple of weeks then get checked to make sure I was shooting blanks."
179,Confirmed man here. Your husband is a douchebag. Was cheating. And is a psycho.
180,"tbf, infections in that area must smell like dead animals."
181,"I had mine a year ago, only pain I had after the freezing wore off was because the doc was not gentle with the jingles while he was working on them.  I waited the week or so and was apparently giving myself blue balls, so after that I was fine.  No blood in anything.

My only concern is that even with the cauterization sometimes they grow back together.  Not sure if I should go for regular white soldier counts or not."
182,"You should be allowed to change your mind. When he asked her to pretend it was rape, it sounds like he wanted an excuse in court."
183,Time for a hamberder
184,Yeah - she should've waited until she past you to offer a hug.  That was entrapment!
185,"They had us in the first 90%, not gonna lie."
186,How do we know she didn't have an infection though? Perhaps she did but OP got lucky and didn't catch anything himself.
187,"100%.  He laid on some serious fucking sexual abuse, then mental abuse.

Sounds like a win for OP.  Sucks she's gotta go through these mind games, though :("
188,At this point /r/tifu is just creative writing for bad situations.
189,He said it was in 2004 so I'm gonna place my bets on no.
190,Yeah he is definitely cheating on you.
191,"No difference at all for me. Same color, the ex said same taste, same amount and same (lack of) speed and distance"
192,right? imagine being so uncomfortable with sex as a grown adult that you have to call your mother because you saw sex toys. very bizarre
193,Coerced.  That makes it rape.
194,"""I told him I’m ready and consented to his request for anal and to pretend it was not consensual during sex""

""I didn’t have to pretend I was sobbing because the experience was not enjoyable for me one bit""

She's saying it right here. She didn't even have to pretend it wasn't consensual = it wasn't.
You can look at it any way you want, even if she agreed to do it, by the end she felt it wasn't consensual, so it wasn't. Seems like they didn't even discuss a safe word or anything to make it stop, and anyway she was tricked into doing it. Sounds like rape to me."
195,Seems like a bit of an extreme reaction. Enjoy your vacation and call a locksmith when you get home.
196,This dude was so fucking somebody on the side
197,"God damn I’m squirming over here. I had mine done last year. My nuts were grapefruits for a few days and I didn’t leave my recliner. I felt like Randy Marsh with testicular cancer (without using them like a hopping ball.)

Nothing like that though.. sorry dude. But it’s all worth it when it’s over."
198,"Fully agree. Best copay I ever spent: Virtually no pain, snipped on Friday, [careful] sex on Sunday; I didn't even need pain medication."
199,Why are you buying period blood?
200,"Agree. Sounds like a crappy doctor all around. I especially cringed when he said that shaved him with a single blade razor. They should have really used clippers, micro cuts from a razor can increase infection risk."
201,Yeah that's what I'm wondering......
202,Kinda like me
203,"Fantasy is fine,  but he ignored what she consented for...

Edit: he"
204,What if it's chocolate milk
205,"Dude, I lived it. Don't lecture a sexual abuse survival about what is and isn't coercion or rape.

Nothing has to be explicitly said for coercion to work. He made it clear that he would leave her if she did not sexually fulfill his fantasy. That's abuse and coercion at work.

You don't know what coercion looks like firsthand, and you don't understand the circumstances fully. The fear of saying 'no' escalating to more harm. She fucking cried while being hurt during anal, that she was unwilling to do unless this dire circumstance. If he was willing to hurt her here while she complied, the fear of coercion is what else is gonna happen if I say no?

Take the philosophy out and actually listen to the ones who survived it and know the signals, the signs, the reactions, and have actual knowledge."
206,Am I the only person who thinks it’s kind of fucked up that they needed his wife’s consent?
207,r/awardspeechedits you sound like a fool
208,"&gt; After making my appointment with urologist he insisted that my wife also give consent

Get a different urologist"
209,"&gt;the doc was not gentle with the jingles while he was working on them.

You could say he...

...roughed up the suspects"
210,It has been 8 years since mine.  The little clamp on the left side sometimes decides move in a way that is uncomfortable for a few minutes.  But that is the sum total of my negative experience.  It has been great not needing birthcontrol all these years.
211,Absolutely horrifying
212,"She litteraly had no way to say no since she was supposed to be pretending to be raped. That's the problem right here. Even if she consented to it at first, and even without looking at coercion, she had absolutely no way out in case she changed her mind. Without any safe word, and being supposed to pretend she was raped, there was no way for her to make him stop. If you engage in a sexual act with someone without leaving them any way out, that's rape already. If I have sex with a girl who says she likes to be strangled, and then I do it violently without her having any way to say stop, then it's rape."
213,Where’s it from I didn’t catch that
214,"If I were the GF that's the thing that would piss me off more than the prank itself.

Even if he'd let it go a day or two that's all in good fun, but dragging it out for a week is definitely a step too far."
215,Lamp
216,100%.  This poor girl has been gaslit.
217,"If it helps, they were always there. Years, decades of life moving through a world filled with tiny creatures you never see, never even know about. Not just spiders, they aren't even that populous compared to the trillions on trillions of small insects.

And in all that time, you never got bitten. You never had any of *those* spiders touch you, bother you, or even get close enough to scare you. Instead, they were out there keeping any of a dozen types of harmful creatures away from you by eating them.

What you saw wasn't an invading army of arachnids. It was your own personal security team helping keep invading hordes of insects from swarming you in wave after wave of itchy irritation.

Yeah spiders look scary. And anything small enough to crawl on a person is sure to raise goosebumps. But they really are our r/spiderbro s"
218,Keep going I'm close 💦
219,"Can you wear like... swim shorts over your bikini bottom? Or if the bruise isn’t shaped like whatever he whacked you with, maybe you could have ‘fallen down the stairs’? As someone that usually has butt bruises from the same thing, those are my usual go-to’s."
220,How did you become the lube expert? What's your story?
221,"Yeah you shouldn't have unprotected sex for at least a few weeks. I had to go back in after 2 weeks and give a sample, and then I was supposed to go back again after that to make double sure but my first sample came back at absolutely zero so they didn't bother to do the second"
222,"Also dude, agree with all above. GET OUT! now! dont make excuses for him, at least read about that type of behavior and youll see that those are some HUGE red flags"
223,"If a hot sweaty day can cause some bad odor, I can only imagine an infection. Fuck that."
224,Right? I mean at worst I was expecting a corn dog related vomit/fart/belch type incidence. Not this.  Not this at all.
225,Use it to pour gravy.
226,You cork your semen with your thumb to keep the cum inside? Ouch.. how? Doesn't it hurt/kill the orgasm? Seems like you'd backfire and shoot a testicle out of your asshole.
227,"TL;DR - After my girlfriend pranked me, I decided to get revenge and pranked her by pretending to be Samara from ""The Ring"" - she absolutely did not like that and now I’m either single or not getting any for a while."
228,"I see no FU on your part  except maybe marrying this guy in the first place..

He wanted you to change your body, Got angry when you had your suspicions, blackmailed you so he could get what he wanted from you sexually and then just left after he got what he wanted. 

I'm sorry but he sounds like a complete jerk, and as others have said, I'd say your suspicions were correct.

If I'd been accused of something like that I would have laughed it off if I had nothing to hide.. he now has a ""way out"" without him seeming like the bad guy.

I'm sorry this has happened to you. You deserve better."
229,I am Patrick Bateman. Everything this man did sounds justly reasonable. Have you heard the new Huey Louis and the News album?
230,Dude. Wtf did I just read
231,One time I spilled coffee all over a table I was serving. My boss comped the whole meal even though I only burnt myself and didn’t get any on them. They tipped me the full amount of the meal. Most people are good. 😭

235,"I was expecting this to end with you gettong an erection and being super embarrassed.

This is even better lol."
236,Sex is not a crime. You were in a paid for private room. Stop making sex a vulgar act. Also congrats on the sex!
237,"I’d hire a P.i. To try and find evidence he was cheating,"
238,Found the non wiper.
239,"the other possibility is dying during childbirth

I got snipped and didn't jizz blood"
240,GET TESTED. HE'S BEEN CHEATING. Do you really think he slept alone after he left? Do you have a camera in the condo?
241,"I appreciate the kindness, but I def feel like I fucked up, shouldn’t have assumed"
242,"Oh shit, I didn't realize. That's actually really messed up."
243,But she‘s also cool for not taking advantage.
244,"Don't, just make sure that they get the laparoscopic version of this from someone that knows what they're doing and everything will turn out fine. The dangers in a vasectomy for birth control are very low compared to the dangers for the woman to do tubal ligation or whatever."
245,"Correct.  He used her fear to gain her ""consent"".  She only did it because she feared her life as she knew it would be taken away otherwise.

If someone held a gun to your dogs head and told you to have sex with them and you agreed, is it consensual?  Your life wasnt at risk.   No.  It's rape."
246,"You. My rational brain loves you right now.

 While I get what you're saying, I cant help the visceral reaction spiders give me. And to think they are out there. Waiting. Watching. Yup. Never going outside again. 

I can pinpoint to the day when my fear began, I ended up in the hospital for almost a month due to a spider bite when I was like 6 or 7 years old. 
I wish I could control it and make it stop."
247,I honestly can't believe some of these comments. Pretty clear that those people have never been in a relationship with anything other than a body pillow
248,"Yeah totally, dude is getting it somewhere else."
249,"sure, OP consented, but consented under duress. i think you can agree that being threatened into consent is a pitifully low standard, right u/entropic_apotheosis ?"
250,Why the fuck is this trending
251,"Your ""husband"" is a piece of fucking trash. What a disgusting shit head."
252,"I don't, why are y'all acting like eating period blood isn't gross?"
253,So like the first day and last day of your period for a lot of women it’s brownish because it’s not a lot and it’s not coming out fast and it basically just tinges your natural lubricant/discharge brownish which looks gross but it doesn’t smell or taste very different from a normal pissy because there’s so little.
254,"Yeah, I made a total gash of it"
255,"No, he's cheating on you. Not only that, but he used you."
256,That’s how women act too.  It’s a pretty standard response to being accused of cheating while cheating
257,And their made up sexual encounters
258,I'd like you to explain to me how you ask someone to stop without a safe word when you started the sexual intercourse pretending to be raped...
259,seriously? this got deleted as i was reading it....
260,One time I came home early from third shift to scare the fuck out of my wife and her boyfriend.
261,I’m glad it came out okay
262,Ok had one 4 years ago and had zero issues as well. Sorry to hear yours was that much of a nightmare. My doctor said I was about his 1400th patient so I wasn't too worried.
263,Details. Boner. -Einstein
264,Damn. Your comment was perfect until the NON mandatory obligation to thank people 🤦🏻‍♂️
265,That's not any better lmao.
266,No doubt. Textbook.
267,"No bud. She was probably on her period. Unless it smelled like shit, which you never mentioned"
268,"I think you should attempt to offer a sincere apology to that person in private at some point. Not ""hey man, I'm sorry"", but more like ""I honestly didn't see you in the chair because I wasn't actually looking at what I was doing, and I am sorry that my stupidity caused this"". SandStorm, I'm not actually saying you're stupid, but if you apologize with a little bit of sincere self-deprecation, it is more likely to smooth things out."
269,"As someone who is considering getting snipped, thank you to everyone reassuring that this isn't nornal."
270,More like peanutbutter according to the last edit.
271,"Shaving minutes before, especially like described, makes me question the competence. That's a sure way to make infections more likely. I was advised to shave several days before, being careful not to cut myself."
272,"It didnt hurt me at all besides a bit of soreness and open surgery cuts that I had to take care of for a few days.  OP in an exception, no loss of semen here, 10/10 would get again"
273,It's a gta4 reference
274,Yeahh I was also thinking this. Sounds like she was on the first or last day of her period
275,she can say that there was an mosquito on her ass and she VIOLENTLY SLAPPED
276,Thank you for sharing. I have ladybits and I love to feel educated on man bits. You know they never share the range of what is normal to either sex growing up.
277,This is actually so disturbing. Not a TIFU. I'm sorry that you went through this. This man is an absolute piece of shit.
278,Your husband is a psychopath
279,"You might want to also post this at /r/twoxchromosomes or whatever it's called, because they are extremely supportive when it comes to this kind of stuff."
280,It wouldn't fly. You could go with abuse but considering she consented rape is not on the table. And filing for it then is wrong.
281,"Can confirm. Once my ex husband unintentionally scared the shit out of me. He was working third shift and I thought he left for work and got in the shower. He hadn't left and came in to ask me a question and I ended up on the floor of the shower crying. Anyway, got a good few days of ""remember when you made me think I was gonna get murdered?"" when I wanted him to do something. But this? She's getting years out if this one."

288,"You definitely deserve the nickname “Rapey Reese.” You should only feel comfortable whipping out your little pistol, if, and only if, the receiving partner has verbally confirmed they want to have sex. You literally tried to rape her in her sleep. You really fucked up, and are probably lucky that the family didn’t press charges."
289,Im sure they were trembling in fear.
290,I don't think you 'falsely' accused him. He's a monster.

301,Should be simple enough...
302,"Exactly what I was going to say. At least in the US, and I believe in other countries as well, consent needs to be FREELY GIVEN. By the nature of the “coercion” (read: blackmail), this counts as assault. With how shittily the courts treat assault survivors, it likely wouldn’t go anywhere anyway, but it’s very much worth a shot because holy fuck dude, this isn’t just one red flag, it’s the whole cavalry."

Please for your own sake get yourself away from this man as he obviously is an abusive piece of shit. Reading this made me feel sick to the stomach having been in an abusive relationship. You need to understand that what he did was rape. It doesn’t matter that you ”constented” to it in the beginning. You did it for him when you didn’t really want to and it hurt you. Please send me a PM if you feel like talking about anything. I hope you get out of this okay. I know I’m a stranger to you but things like these make me just wanna hug all the victims.

329,He never said that though.
330,"&gt; I apologized and begged for forgiveness. And he said he would consider it if I finally agree to some of the bedroom acts he wanted to try but I had previously refused.

Coerced. He said to her he would consider forgiving her, if she let him do stuff that she obviously don't want to do. She ""consented"" the same way you'd ""consent"" giving your wallet when getting mugged."

368,Sweat trench. I get that isn’t unique to the situation but add the fact that I’m a bit compulsive about being clean and that’s why I separate the two.
369,"He’s cheating on you. I’m a dude, and that’s how men act when confronted."
370,It's not obligatory. Think for yourself.
371,Look on the bright side.  You solved your arachnophobia problem.  With agoraphobia.
372,"Seriously. A TL;DR should be a comprehensive one or two sentence summary of the story. Some require up to a paragraph. 

This one should be:

“TL;DR - I pranked my girlfriend real bad and now I’m either single or not getting any for a while.”"
373,I would dump someone for writing Shleven Days on the internet.
374,Why are some people such crybabies about blood? Just gotta throw a blanket down.
375,It’s just kinda nasty to use something that you use for your butt on your body is my guess
376,or maybe someone is jealous they don’t have an fwb. Guess we’ll never know. lol
377,"don't think of your gran, else you'll never get your wallet back!"
378,"You might wanna get your A1C checked, if ants are interested in your dirty drawers it could mean your blood sugar is off."
379,Have one scheduled for 9/19 that I'm nervous about (it's a sensitive area ok!) Reading OP like o fuck o fuck I shouldn't have read this... Thanks for your comment makes me feel a little more at ease.
380,"*slams table* thank you

Everyone congratulating OP for ""dodging a bullet"" or whatever hasn't really considered things from the girl's side - they just smugly assume moral superiority because they have no personal stake in this conflict, and can thus afford to be ""neutral"" and ""see both sides"""
381,Im sorry.. you do WHAT?!?! to your dick hole when you cum.
382, [http://removeddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d01lzp/tifu\_by\_having\_phone\_sex\_with\_my\_uncle/](http://removeddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d01lzp/tifu_by_having_phone_sex_with_my_uncle/)
383,How do you press 3 when you have broken arms?
384,"So you think that the person who physically has the house key owns the house? Let me assure you that houses don't work that way.

Do you own the house? Then you can enter the house without a key. Locksmith, busted window, cut hole on the roof etc.

Do you rent the house? Then you can enter the house without a key. Call a locksmith and the owner.

Also, enjoy that damn vacation!"
385,"Also a dude, can concur. If that's the husband's personality, divorce should be happening anyways"
386,"I don't think it's quite a severe as others make out. I think she was probably awake and comfortable with a cuddle, but didn't one anything more. She could have been asleep, in that case it was sketchy asf. In future have a kiss before you escalate, or at least make sure the other party is awake."
387,"My sister got her tubes tied _and_ BIL a vasectomy.  Not sure if they are swingers, or don't enjoy BC and my latest nephew is more difficult than he seems."
388,"Yet another ""had one, nothing worse than a bit of discomfort for a few days after"" checking in.

Horror stories are good for reading about in TIFU but don't let them put you off making sensible decisions :)"
389,"And if they’re anything like my kids, they sleep through everything. Literally had lightning strike a tree across the street from us the other night, woke my wife and I like a bomb went off, both kids slept right through it."
390,This dude is 10000000% psychotic!!
391,She had shit in her vagina? Or did you put it in the butt? I’m a bit confused
392,You dodged a bullet because I would have probably kept pushing the question to the point of no return. The sex would have ended right there because I would have thrown up everywhere
393,Fellow Florida man?
394,I was tender maybe two days. Swollen slightly for about 4.  Never had any of this
395,"Right. A moment of ""boo!"" THAT IS INSTANTLY REVEALED TO BE OKAY, vs. something scary, that you kept up for a week, by exploiting the trust she had in you.

Why should she ever trust you to give a shit about her feelings?"
396,"That's probably not good for your health or the environment, but it's your business so I hope it at least works."
397,"To be fair I don't really seem to ""get"" other women so yeah I guess not? But I don't really get that outlook. Anyway I feel these things should really be discussed before marriage to make sure you're sexually and morally compatible. I wish people had more honest relationships.

Is it common for men to call female phone sex workers to roleplay giving another man oral sex? How does that work? Wouldn't they want to play that out with a man? Or is it chicks with dicks specifically that is common?"
398,The 16yo brother definitely smelled it at the very least.
399,"Yeah that’s fucking creepy man, especially the condom rings"
400,"&gt; I dont like Trump. Of course he was better than the Chinese shill Hillary who would have got us into a shooting war with Russia in Syria and who under Obama was funding Al Qaeda in Syria.


Hey look, it's the uncle nobody wants to talk to at thanksgiving."
401,"Doesn't have to be long distance.  I was living with a Fiancee and working night shifts doing security.  While I was out doing that paying the bills, she had a regular line of dudes coming through the house and her.  
On the other hand when I met my now wife, after we got engaged she was on the other side of the planet (I was in Canada, she was in Australia - moved back after working in Canada for a few years) for 3 months before I emigrated and I'm absolutely sure of her fidelity the whole time.

It's not the distance of the relationship, it's the quality and ethical foundation of your partner.  In the end, you are better off and there will be someone more deserving down the line."
402,"100% this. Nobody, on the first fuck just bends the girl over and puts a dick straight into her ass, no fingering, no foreplay, just boom straight into a strangers asshole. Bull. Shit."
403,F(uck)
404,Plus he literally offered to I.D the girl
405,"I actually wrote a short story with that premise. I'll see if I can upload it to my portfolio (if you'd like to read it).

Edit: [Link](www.clippings.me/fumbly) Read ""All I know"" for this one, and ""Why I don't kidnap princesses anymore"" if you like that kind of awkward humor."
406,Go to the doctor. Don't be dumb.
407,"He's hiding something and used it as an excuse to take advantage of you, I advise you seek legal advice."
408,lmaooo
409,"FFS, you DID catch him. He is absolutely cheating on you.  


Get together all the  financial documents, account #'s and passwords that you can and make an appointment with a lawyer asap."
410,"Umm what in the world? I’ll let you F me in the A if you forgive me??? 

You’re better off. For that matter, you should probably stay single to protect yourself and work on increasing your self worth"
411,You’re probably right. He probably drove a wedge between her family too. Told her she was out of shape and “helped” her “improve”.
412,Oh it is. I saw this tweet (which admittedly oversimplifies the issue to a degree) that basically said “straight guys understand the nuances of consent perfectly when it comes to gay men/trans women making advances on them.”
413,"This pisses me off!!! So much!!! Every internet story I've seen (sans the one in this post) said ""I was sore for a day then was back to normal"". I had a vasectomy a month and a half ago and I am JUST NOW getting over the pain. I felt like I was constantly post nut-punch. I had to go back to work waddling like a damn penguin. DAMN YOU AND YOUR PLEASANT EXPERIENCE! The internet lied to me!"
414,"Thanks man. Good to know. Does it feel any different for you? Im a bit nervous, but free two kids, I think it’s time."
415,YES!
416,I can vouch for him. His wife definitely doesn’t want to see him again.
417,"TLDR: that scene in Big Mouth where their heads explode after their friend tells them ""girls get horny too""

There really isnt that big of a difference... but people always seem to think its completely different... the biggest difference, when it comes down to it, is equipment. Thats it. 

If there is something you never talk about, and it is a part of your lives, chances are they have an opinion on it. If you have thoughts on it that you never bring up, they also probably have thoughts on it and may not know how to being it up."
418,What about a flamethrower to clear your path while you slowly walk away?
419,I think this definitely counts as cheating. But that’s my two cents.
420,Gross and entertaining. 10/10
421,I mean the idea of it is read about the horror stories for birth control. Especially long term- like the super convenient IUD- ever met someone who had one migrate? We won’t even get into pregnancy and childbirth. So long as you think “fuck that” when presented with the risks that would be posed to your partner to ensure pleasure/convenience during spontaneous sexual encounters then you’re perfectly sensible in saying that.
422,"So here's a little tip. Even if this story is true.. I'm sure its embellished a lot... it was probably period blood. There is no way unless he scooped shit out of her asshole to get it all over his fingers...

If she didnt wipe he would have smelled it. It was period blood."
423,"Same. Had mine, no issues at all."
