We regularly have  cranberry juice at  breakfast time and daughter asks for a sip of her aunt's juice, to which my sister responds ""Not this time, sweetie, it's vodka."" Daughter apparently takes it into her head from this instance that cranberry juice = vodka, which we discovered because she informed her pre school teacher that ""me and daddy drink vodka for breakfast."" I had a lot of explaining to do at pick up time. "

The next day, I had all but two seconds of cramping as a warning before literally losing quarts of liquid from my bowels. I couldn't keep food down, anything that went down my throat came out liquified for days. It was horrendous. What little weight I lost wasn't even close to being worth it."

62,"Toasters are Contraband in a lot of \[American, to be fair\] university residence halls, just like candles, hot plates, small-space heaters, and other heat-producing objects that can easily be turned/left on, forgotten about, and cause a Real Fire. Most universities provide at least one microwave per residence hall, however, so that residents can still ""cook"" things like instant oatmeal, popcorn, mac'n'cheese, and ramen noodles. Most standard microwaves also do not have an open heat/flame source, like a toaster or a space heater, which can be brushed against by a curtain or a piece of paper or something similarly flammable and cause a fire. 

It's also *significantly* easier to burn things in a toaster than it is in a microwave, making the risk of it producing copious amounts of smoke/catching fire even higher than with a microwave. 

As for you, OP, I wouldn't feel too bad... if I had a dollar for every time someone in my freshman dorm set off the fire alarm because they were microwaving something while stoned, I'd be a rich woman. I'd also try explaining to your RA that you were obviously panicking because of your short-sightedness and had just been trying to keep your stuff safe from the water since you were in the unique position to know that there wasn't actually any fire endangering anyone.

Any time we give his full name to an official (e.g., real estate agent, mortgage broker, financial advisor], they look at us like we‚Äôre idiots and proceed to write his name without the ‚Äújunior‚Äù in it. Every time that happens we have to show his ID to confirm that yes, Junior is part of his official name and it needs to be on whatever forms you‚Äôre giving us. "

He was in this habit of starting my Jeep in the morning's (it always irritated me, but whatever - it was just one of things that wasn't worth fighting over) and he walked out one morning to start it. I was right behind him as I needed to leave for work. Unfortunately, I did not put the car in neutral when I got home the night before and it was still in first gear. It jerked and knocked me into some wiring shelving in the garage. My husband screamed and screamed. He couldn't get in the car fast enough to put it in reverse so I could get out (thankfully I reacted in a way that left a little bit of space between the Jeep, me, and the shelf). Anyway, I did not want to go to the hospital or doctor or anything that resembled a medical facility because I was so worried the doctor would think he did it on purpose. We ended up going and, thankfully, the doctor was understanding because her father had something similar happen to him (a freak accident)! 

And, my husband does not start the Jeep for me in the morning's anymore :)"

You came onto a relatively innocent post where someone created an awkward situation from a slip of the tongue, decided to attack the OP for something you really don't seem to have any basis for, and then I assume told all your friends how you pwn'd some stupid chick online for existing. 

Now, I know you have a history of trying to make yourself appear extremely intelligent, based on your nonsensical political views and the regular spew of vomit you cover just about any controversial post with, so I hope you can see that hypocrite is exactly the correct word given what you accused OP of. You should also spend some thought on the fact that your statement was entirely unnecessary, unwelcome, and lacks any form of evidence, same as all your other claims and assertions. Next time, just shut up when your statement adds nothing, it takes less energy.

I personally can't wait to see how you respond but do us all and yourself a favor. Take the L, reconsider your life decisions, and move on. Use that sharp eye of yours to see that you're simply not wanted here unless you would like to apologize, which I do encourage. Otherwise, take your busted ass back to making conspiracy theories.

And that's all it took. Some friend of theirs on their facebook told their parent who rang CPS.
