0,Yeah there’s no coming back from that.
1,Whatever you do don’t spank it to the 360 VR vid.
2,I'm sorry man but I'm upvoting solely for that username.
3,Lord of the Strings
4,Tbh a dick that big sounds awful.
5,"Of the 14,000,605 scenarios I have seen, you survive... none."
6,"Hey OP your wife is coming! OH SHIT HE HAS AIRPODS HE CAN'T HEAR US  


sorry."
7,Stop before you get to the 2020 Olympics.
8,"Sometimes I wish I could unsee things too man. It fucks with your head, doesnt it? Wish I knew how to help, but I can only sympathize."
9,Masturbated too close to the sun.
10,Dickarus.
11,Dude you’re fucked
12,"I'm an international sports lawyer.

I presume you are American based.

I presume you are competing in competitions which are (ultimately) governed by the US Sports Shooting Federation.

You need to apply for what is called a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). 

The [USADA website](https://www.usada.org/substances/tue/apply/) has all the information you need."
13,This might very well be the biggest tifu of this sub ever.
14,"[Is this an accurate re-creation of the picture you saw?](https://imgur.com/gallery/EefEU)

15,"""Good plan, bad execution.""

Perfect reaction.   You got a keeper there, mate."
16,"Go, right now to her house. Break in quietly. Sneak into the kitchen (where all parents leave their phones at night). Delete message. Problem solved. 

Also, drink all the milk and leave the carton in the fridge."
17,What is a sword that hasn't seen blood
18,Give us an update OP
19,An actual fuck up and it happened today. Best post 2019.
20,You failed because the woman pushed a button on your phone and saw porn and proved you WEREN'T cheating!? That's super harsh!
21,The only solution is to seek out this ex boyfriend and have sex with him yourself. You’ll show that girl who means business.
22,"""you're not my girlfriend""

""buy me lunch, and we'll see what happens"""
23,I can't believe OP is fucking dead.
24,At least your girlfriend can laugh about it :D
25,"I can’t even begin to imagine the apoplectic rage his wife felt when she looked into the VR.

No offence OP but this is fucking hilarious. It could be the closing scene to a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode."
26,"You didn't do anything wrong. But if someone asks your secret you probably shouldn't say, ""Me too pro, lol."""
27,I think you just wanted to flex on us with those airpods
28,"Seriously. Past a certain point (a pretty modest point tbh), shit just hurts."
29,"If you do, spring out naked when she's with her friends again to propose."
30,Yeah your def screwed. If it was anyone other than her sister you may have been able to come back.
31,"Rest in pieces, OP"
32,"You set off the comb plate impact safeties, which are tripped by a given horizontal force. If a person gets caught where these teeth mesh with the bottom combplate it is meant to trip this safety circuit before they are literally ground to a pulp.

33,"Damn bro, that’s rough. I feel like once you hit long term relationship status, you sterilize your phone. That shit would probably ruin me."
34,With Airpods on !
35,Now his gf and her sister can both laugh about it ;D
36,"""It was clear that you were having a rough day and I thought it would give you a good laugh.

I really just wanted to lighten the mood. 

Why else would I have walked out in such an unusual way? """
37,"I used to own a gym &amp; one of my regulars had broken up with his wife &amp; went off the radar for a year or two. 

He popped back one night for a chat &amp; a catch-up. He said that at one point he’d got a new girlfriend who was a screamer- she shouted &amp; threw herself about &amp; was ridiculously vocal in bed. 

He reckons he’d had sex with her about 3 or 4 times &amp; whenever he was banging her he was the king of the world. 

...Until half way through their next performance when she stopped all the histrionics and said something along the lines of, “ I fucking love shagging you- my last boyfriend’s cock was too big &amp; it used to hurt me. But yours, yours fits just fine.”

And that was the last time they had sex. 

And then he told all his mates thinking they would sympathise. Oh how they laughed."
38,"Lasted 20 minutes, without a condom, the first time having sex with the 10 at his high school that every guy wants to get with, who had her own hotel room and apparently saved her virginity just for him, AND he was just super chill the month after... Kids must have changed a lot in the last 25 years. Best of luck My Dude."
39,I'm not gonna lie man that's absolutely hilarious and wild how that all came together perfectly for this to happen
40,"1. Be lawyer

2. Be lawyer... in sports

3. Go international"
41,If mom knew about the debacle then that was one hell of a power move at the end LOL
42,"Yeah, need to get a ring for her now"
43,"""Oh no don't worry honey, it's not like your sister *consented* to this"""
44,This actually gave me second hand heartbreak dude.... Like...im so sorry man
45,"I’m just picturing your dad explaining it to people who saw him when his herpes flared up. 

“Hey, did you ever figure out who you got herpes from?”

“Oh yeah, turns out I just got it from my daughter.”"
46,"A pervert and divorced.

Now thats a tifu"
47,I’m pretty sure she’d be equally mad if it were her mother instead
48,YTA
49,Should have rubbed that bloody finger on her forehead like Simba.
50,Wel all skipping past the ' a girl saw and asked' part? That'd be a pretty major development and improvement on any day!
51,"You might be able to salvage your job if you didn't say too much to your boss. Put it on a medical issue and you're less likely to be terminated or for them to verify. I'm not talking about ""random boner"" medical condition, I mean ""I took some prescription Cialis last night, and effects can be felt for a while. I wasn't masturbating, I was trying to make it go down so I could participate in a professional atmosphere.""
It doesn't matter if the whole thing is a lie, it's about having those ""legitimate medical issues"" give HR pause to move forward. Regardless, you're going to need a new job."
52,"&gt; Sneak into the kitchen (where all parents leave their phones at night)

Holy shit.  Does everyone's parents do this?"
53,"The best part is that a lot of the fuckups are accidents or stupid shit done in the heat of the moment. This dude actually planned to watch porn of his sister in law that was intended to be left private... Just from a moral standpoint / normal-people-don't-jerk-it-to-friends+family standpoint thats pretty fucked, even if he didn't get caught"
54,Saved. This is the post proposal possible after this fuck up
55,"Make sure you include that on your resume: ""skilled at engaging waiting patients."""
56,Hope you saved a copy of the video because that's all the sex you gonna get in a long time while the divorce goes on.
57,How TF did you get through middle school and high school?
58,"That's not your best friend. Shit, that's not even really your friend."
59,"Yeah seriously, do not envy OP right now. Gotta see how this plays out.😬😬"
60,"Grief is weird. It can hit when you don't expect it, even years later. You didn't do anything wrong. Give her a hug. If she wants to, it might help her to talk about him."
61,"It wasn't the vr, man. You don't need to have the 'what constitutes as cheating' discussion to know that masturbating to your wife's sister is wrong. Now when she sees her sister she has to think about the fact you want to stick it in her. You're supposed to be family, man. You can't act on base instincts like that with family.

Also, it sounds like you need to figure your shit out. You add in backstory about this thing you had with your wife's sister like it pardons you for jerking it to her because it's just 'fantasy' and not 'actually sleeping with the woman I still seem to be crushing on'. No man, that makes it worse. You need to let this fantasy of the two of you together go COMPLETELY, and treat her like your biological sister, if you want any chance of staying with your wife. 

TLDR; stop perving on your wife's sister. It's a complete violation of trust. The past is the past."
62,"At least OP seems to be in good enough spirits to choose a funny name, instead of ""brbkillingmyself69"" or something"
63,Theres always a bigger fish...
64,"I think your feelings are very valid. It's not just about the dick size. Often times, when you find out that your current SO's ex had better income, better job, bigger dick, bigger boobs, and more, you are bound to compare yourself with him/her.  


If you truly love your girlfriend and wish to continue the relationship, just sit down with her and be honest. Tell her that you accidentally stumbled upon previous photos with her ex. Don't mention anything about the dick size. Just ask her why she kept those photos. And if she says anything along the line of - I forgot to delete them and all she cares about is you, then you should feel confident that she loves you as a person and everything about you. Of course, you will still have a bit of doubt in yourself that you will never be as good as her ex, but there is a reason why she broke up with her ex, right?"
65,This calls for some Fs in the chat boys.
66,"I can show you my tiny ass dick if it makes you feel better, bro."
67,In 360 degrees with VR set.
68,Are you dead yet
69,"I thought your dad would have been the weakest of you all, but I must say I was wrong after his powernap woke the beast within him."
70,This is the single dumbest action I've heard of on Reddit in my very short Reddit scrolling career.
71,RIP his outbox too
72,Hahahaha! I'm gonna screenshot that and send it to her!
73,"...Dude. Not only did you get caught jerking off to 360 degrees VR porn by your wife, not only did that porn contain someone you both know, not ONLY is it your wife's sister... it was all without your wife sister's knowledge. So now you look like a horny, pervy scumbag as well as a complete creep. You literally couldn't have fucked up more if you tried, congrats OP!"
74,"Maybe it was just the perspective. I always thought I had a huge dick, turns out I just have really tiny hands."
75,Or just imagine that she was sucking 2 coke cans staked on each other as mentioned in the original post.
76,"The image of you wearing just a diving hood, sitting spread eagle, with a bowl of cereal is fucking hilarious."
77,She could think that her sister sent it to you intentionally and that you've been hiding an affair lol
78,"I don't know what would be worse, hitting the door against the curb or hitting the girlfriend."
79,"'Engaging wank mode, my Lord' lmao"

I'm just gonna put this here

83,For our entertainment they should keep going and hopefully make the olympics.
84,"Omg his sister in law is DUMMY THICC, he cant hear anything over the sound of her ass cheeks clapping"
85,Also kept them to remember the damage it caused.
86,"He could have fucked up a little more, like for example making a post on a popular website with enough specifics to be identifiable, in which he states he would have left his wife for her sister if given the opportunity. So, good thing he didn't do that."
87,Still covered my phone while opening this at work
88,If it’s that big it probably hurt her. She probably prefers yours tbh.
89,"&gt;This happened an hour ago, and I’m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s 2 “situations” that leads to the conclusion of the FU.  
&gt;  
&gt;First situation:  
&gt;  
&gt;Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.  
&gt;  
&gt;Found out the memory card still had content.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 “porn” video, assuming sent to him a while back.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.  
&gt;  
&gt;So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I’ve always fantasized about, “gifting my past self”, while living my happy current life.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second accident:  
&gt;  
&gt;I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it’s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she’s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?  
&gt;  
&gt;I have the day off today, today was the day I’d do the “deed”. I don’t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.  
&gt;  
&gt;This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the “foreplay” she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife’s phone didn’t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.  
&gt;  
&gt;She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.  
&gt;  
&gt;But VR porn was never “discussed” as an “is it cheating if....” thing. You know the convo I’m talking about, “is it cheating if you have a sex doll”, “is it cheating if it’s a robot”, “is it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time”, etc...  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the type of convo we’d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let’s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we’re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyways, VR wasn’t a “thing” back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was “right” or “wrong” for me to do so. I guess it was “wrong” since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That’s when I see her in the room.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fuck??” she says.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then she looks inside.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Is that my sister?!?!”  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m fucked.  
&gt;  
&gt;She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.  
&gt;  
&gt;Seeing from the tracking app... she’s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m fucked.  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law’s 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don’t know what’s going to happen.

Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up."
90,You.. you.. you didnt see the guy who lost his wife and house because he got caught watching VR porn of the sister in law and subsequently posted it on reddit which his then wife seen and replied saying she is his ex wife?
91,"Yeah... call bs on this.

The call taxi button at taxi stands doesn't work this way at all. All it does is just light up the taxi stand outside the mall to notify nearby taxis that people at this stand needs taxi. The button literally just lights a board up."
92,"Dude, if you have to jack off twice a day because your boners won't go away, you should probably see a doctor."
93,I think this is the biggest actual TIFU I have seen on this sub in 4ish years.
94,"I wouldn't even say modest, the dick really has to be tiny to fit inside [M]ine."
95,Legendary
96,Not literally
97,"I think you blew right past being the biggest perv and just landed yourself with a lifetime's worth of issues.

RIP my dude."
98,"Pack it up boys, we peaked. See ya again in 2020."
99,I was here when the biggest TIFU of 2019 happened!
100,Passing out mid blow job is some advanced whiskey dick.
101,"My first thought after reading this is OMG im dying hahaha.....bad enough that the dad thought it was a sex toy but dude dont try to explain yourself with ""Well I'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" that killed it haha"
102,OP went from cripwalking to crippled after parent teacher conference /s
103,Bro. We are gonna need an update because if this is real there is 0 chance shes ever gonna want you back
104,What I don’t get is you have Sex with a 10/10 and then kind of forget about her for a month?
105,"Having a small penis is great.  I never accidentally slam my car door on it, my wife let's me do anal, and I can be naked at the beach and everyone just assumes I'm a really hairy toddler."
106,OPs final flex
107,How exactly does someone get into the niche role of an “international sports lawyer?”
108,"I started playing the latest one with my 6 year old daughter recently, and in a mini game where you guess how many toads go past, she was on the right answer, then I frantically say ""No that's wrong! Stand on the other number"".  She does this, and loses.  I get loud wailing tears for the next 30 minutes.  Never had I felt so guilty.  

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Mario Party can be pretty brutal."
109,I feel like most people in a long term relationship don’t have  pictures/videos of them trying to gobble a baseball bat on their phones.
110,"Can you elaborate on what ""serial killer noises"" sounds like? Thanks."
111,"Woman here, this is 100% correct."
112,"Now the real question is, which LOTR movie were you watching, and were you watching theatrical or extended?"
113,If it was her father it could also raise some questions
114,‘I give myself the dopamine’ is now my favourite saying.
115,"I wonder: if she saw a funny cat video or whatever, would OP have still failed? If yes, then it seems that pressing play was unnecessary.

Or did OP fail because of her embarrassment? That's her problem, not OP's."
116,"But seriously, why is no one talking about “why are those pics still on her phone?” 

Who gives a shit about his dick; an orgasms an orgasm and better with someone you like. But why the fuck is she safekeeping photos of her exes cock?"
117,I appreciate that this is actually a moral failure instead of “getting myself into a wacky misunderstanding”
118,Well yeah. Trying to 69 a dick like that would be suicide.
119,A collector's item that will never see action.
120,Something does indeed feel off...
121,"Fap to it, confuse the fuck out of your brain and you'll be a changed man. Won't bother you anymore"
122,"That's the first time anyone ever address shark week as 'strawberry week'. Period is too painful to romantice it but whatever works for you!

Btw this is just hilarious! At least she's not mad at you 😂😂😂"
123,I fucking love Reddit
124,So you got caught jacking off to your twin sister
125,"""It's the circle of wife..."""
126,Yea I guess if you date your next door neighbor then something like this is eventually bound to happen. Especially if you have the worst luck like me.
127,Real life version of spamming the internet explorer button.
128,My only question is how she can just calmly stand there and laugh without anything to tame the flood!
129,"This story almost seemed like the beginning of a porno itself.

Was the unfair means lady wearing black leather, by chance?"
130,That's the worst part.
131,How about wacking it before going to work?
132,Return of the King Extended!
133,"In order to take that VR back, you must lose that which you love. A soul for a soul."
134,Obviously the sounds of axes being sharpened and a tiny orchestra playing the song from The Shining.
135,"Lol your fuck up is definitely quality story, but good to see your boss saw it as an innocent mistake from your part considering the title confusion (and the channel block was turned off)."
136,Yeah its a dick move honestly.
137,Blood walk into the room when you come back into the room for your conference. Then claim it was all a social commentary on how we need peace in our urban youth culture.
138,"I was visiting my sister in Scotland and riding an escalator at a train stop with my 6 year old daughter. I noticed at the bottom an old granny was trying to pull a young woman up who looked like she was off balance. We were half way to the bottom when I looked closer and realized that the younger woman had been knocked over by her luggage which was now on top of her as the escalator was devouring her pants from the waist band and she couldn’t get up. The old granny was the only thing keeping this young woman from sudden doom, she was pulling on the luggage and the young woman was holding onto the luggage.

I said awkwardly out loud “OH NO.” and leapt down about 7 stairs, squared up behind this woman, grabbed as much material I could and dead lifted her and her pants free from the jaws of this escalator just as they began nipping at the front of my sneakers. I nearly threw her on top of the old granny because I wasn’t sure how much force it would take to free the pants. Once we were all clear I noticed my hands were wet. This poor woman had pissed herself from the experience and was bewildered. Her pants were all torn up, she was bleeding and covered in piss.

Not sure if these sensors are common hardware on escalators but this thing was going to murder this woman and perhaps the granny."
139,"I think the Shaggy ""Wasn't me"" defense might also work here, /u/kingroffy.  Just claim you got walked in on while on the toilet.  Simply deny anything about masturbation.  Especially if you're still young, you could claim you had a random erection and you were waiting for it to pass.  Definitely put the ball back in their court.  Be aggressively defensive:  ""Why are you asking me about what I was doing in the bathroom?"""
140,So is it really how you jerk it?
141,[removed]
142,I honestly don’t know which I would prefer.
143,"Well when you do propose, you should totally put the ring in a wireless earbud case, for the lols."
144,Just jerk off like a normal person
145,But also in all honesty I've see a video of my girlfriend having sex with her previous boyfriend. It's fine dude. You just really need to get over it and not think about it. It really hurt at first but then I just had to remember everyone else on earth has had a past and lived their lives before you came into the picture. Just leave it at that. Past ik the past. Work towards a positive future
146,You really go all out for your beat off sessions
147,She’s just racking up the kills for the kill bonus
148,The fact that he still was holding a candle to the SIL while dating and married to his wife...I can't even begin to imagine how heartbroken his wife must feel to learn that she was her own husband's second choice. OP should behave done them BOTH a favour long back and fucked off from their lives.
149,Virtually
150,"Get accused of cheating, play loud porn for the professor in class to assert dominance.  Chick in class is suddenly DTF.  Sounds like a good day to me."
151,"""Oh were assigning roles already?"""
152,"You need to be careful here. Technically any sanctioned meet can require you to undergo drug testing. If the drug is found in your system then you can be hit with sanctions including being banned from the sport. There is leeway for drugs required for health, but you need to talk to your doctor to see if there may be an alternative, and if not, you need to get it in writing that you need to take this for your health and talk with your club. You will have to fill out forms stating you need it, including documentation, but health of an athlete comes before anything else."
153,"Now his girlfriend, and his sister, and his ex can all laugh about it"
154,"Honestly, that would be a red flag for me in and of itself. I feel like out of respect for your partner you put in the work to make sure shit doesn't happen. You get rid of old nudes/sex tapes. You go through your clothes and make sure random panties aren't buried. You care about them so you put in the effort to ensure there are no issues or misunderstandings. The fact that they didn't do this would make me question our compatibility."
155,"Stick around, there'll be worse. I promise."
156,That update gave me whiplash
157,"Just doing VR porn with airpods in is fucking risky when someone else has a key to your place. 

Doing that while watching a porno of your wife's sister is just whole new levels of stupid."
158,"Hey, at least you didn't find a 360 VR video of her"
159,Fuck the amateur leagues you're due an upgrade to proshooters.  Join the mob.
160,AITA for stealing and pleasuring myself to a fully-immersive porn video that wife's sister made for her husband?
161,Hey at least a drunk dude got you off first. Lol
162,Closing scene? This could be the thread of an entire damn season of Curb!
163,**ERDBEERWOCHE**
164,4. Profit?
165,What I don’t get is how this girl just magically had a hotel room and how this guy just magically last 20 minutes his first time
166,"Worst part is, he seemed like a nice guy"
167,I know that's what I'm whacking off to tonight
168,I took the risk and opened it on my computer screen. I might be too trusting of internet strangers.
169,"We're talking about his penis, right?"
170,"I can totally imagine the stoner logic going through his head:

Hungryyyyyyy... Need food.

So high, what's easy? Toast is easy.

What if everyone else wants toast? I'll make everyone toast.

How many people are there? Me, wife, kids, kids' SOs... Uh, 10?

How many slices of bread do I need? Counting these things is hard.

Fuck it I'm toasting the whole loaf."
171,Please record this routine for us lmao
172,She calls it strawberry week but in german everything sounds a bit more aggressive
173,"I initially thought this kid was gunna search porn audio or something. But no. OP had a WHOLE DAMN HOUSE lights, locks, and music that went into this. 


Well done my lord"
174,F
175,"Weird Science rules are timeless... 

""Anything more than a handful, and you're risking a sprained wrist.""

Sure they were talking about breasts, but the same can be said about a penis."
176,Don't gild; save for the ring.  Post another story afterward! (Hopefully it won't be worthy for this sub)
177,finished the marriage tho
178,"Unlucky, ruined marriage for 5 mins of fun..."
179,"For me, it was the opposite. My dad gave me herpes. As an infant. He kissed my cheek when he ha a cold sore on his mouth. I was covered head to toe in sores. I announce that “my dad gave me herpes” every so often just to see him wince."
180,Omg you need to get this book on amazon called “I Need a New Butt.” It’s all about a kid who discovers he has a butt crack and how he could’ve gotten it and all the replacement butts he thinks he should get. My mother downloaded it to my kindle to read to my son. They were rolling laughing. It would fit perfectly in your situation.
181,I'm very curious to know what happened with OP and this girl. Maybe the fuck up will start something really cool
182,"Yep, pretty much. People have also pointed out my female version looks kinda like my actual sister so that makes it even worse."
183,You should the part where he admitted he would've cheated if she so much as touched his hand. That'll really help his case when the family finds this.
184,"&gt;she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?

Can we stop with this assumption? In general? We survived hundreds of years without being able to be contacted every second of the day. 

Am I alone in thinking the perpetual tracking that's mentioned in this post is creepy?"

192,"My mum had one of these, and for years I thought it was a sex toy. She used to keep a bottle of unlabeled gel beside it which I always assumed was lube. Nope, it was natural aloe very gel that she got from a friend, and it was all pretty innocent."

195,One time in 7th grade I told my teacher she was so old she used to gangbang with the Hebrews and I almost got expelled because she thought I meant got gangbanged by the Hebrews. Had a teacher parent conference and everything. That's where I learned what a gangbang was. I heard that joke from a ludacris cd by the way.

209,"I knew this guy who had a huge donkey dong. Like seriously big, he had won competitions (he was in the army and they did that kind of thing). Well one night he got drunk and he confided to me that it was ""a f***ing curse"". He told me how women he was about to be intimate with would see it and immediately call it off. Or how he wasnt able to have sex that was pleasurable for girlfriends he was in love with, and that roadblock to normal intimacy ruined the relationship. This big, tough, hung like a gas-pump, soldier was in tears telling me this. 


A giant cock? No siree, not for me. I'll stick with my average sized, fits in pretty much any hole, comfortable in my pants, penis ❤"
210,"Yea her exact words were, “You have brought being stupid to a whole new level. This kind of stupidity is the reason we broke up”. My reply was just, “well you shouldn’t have been standing there.”"

214,"If you're otherwise doing well in the class... You're probably going to be fine... But my best advice is to tell your parents what happened before the teacher does... Tell it like you did here, make them laugh... That way they aren't surprised if the teacher brings it up, and will be ready to defend you with a ""well you said to leave if they didn't enjoy the class, he was just doing as he was told""... Your parents were students at one time too, they probably appreciate your antics more than you realize.... Now if you're failing the class on the over head that's a separate issue ..."
215,"I had one of those ""no, it's fine that you didn't last that long tonight. My ex would just keep going for hours and hours untill I just had to stop"""

Just explain that you understand it’s entirely in your head and there’s no reason why she should feel like she did anything wrong but it just is something he needs to deal with but wouldn’t mind her support. At the end of the day she’s with him for a reason. Likely what it would take is a bit of talk about why she’s with him and not her ex for him to feel more confident again in his relationship.

The LAST thing he should do is try and bottle it up and have it lash out in some way like a snide comment next time they’re going at it and him making a remark about how she clearly has had bigger or something."

247,"I genuinely think he may be making something out of nothing I had an ex who was hung, way too damn hung. It was fun to play with and give oral but anything else was miserable and painful. Didn't help he had no idea what he was doing with it."
248,There was a TIFU from a girl awhile back who got drunk and thought she forgot to take out her tampon. Ended up pulling out her IUD.
249,I think if OP tries sucking off double coke can dick guy and takes a picture of it then shows his gf it balances everything out.

I was once on my period. About day 4. Which is very end nearing. Boyfriend decided we should have sex. 
I said “ well I’m on my period and I have a tampon in, so if you want it. You have to pull it out”. Totally thinking he wouldn’t do it. 

BOY was I wrong. He pulls it out and I’m dying laughing all while laying on the bed. He then proceeds to put the bloody tampon over our heads and says “ kiss me under the mistletoe”. 

I could not keep my composure and laughed the whole time I was literally in tears. I have been dying to tell this to someone cause it’s just the right amount of disgusting that makes it hilarious."

261,"OP, I just wanted to say... I have been in your exact shoes. Everything you explained about this girl is exactly what I went through with an ex. Only she had a rabbit dildo that I know she was using. I became obsessed and tried tracking how often she was using it while tallying up months without sex. She too claimed it was due to the birth control and that she never got ""horny"". I moved for work and she had my iPad and tried getting her to move with me, until I noticed the photos that started appearing in the cloud. Nudies, very very hot ones.. thinking ""oh my she must miss me""... but they were never sent to me, so I screen shot them on my phone to question her later. 

I ended up breaking it off with her due to my own insecurities like what you went through. When I went to go collect my stuff she was signed into her google+ account and found thame nudies were in a private album shared with one of my college buddies. The album was created and shared with him 4 months before I broke it off. I was pissed and screen shot everything to throw in her face. I felt defeated and ended up deleting everything and decided to go to the bar for a drink.

Ran into a few friends I knew and didn't recognize the one girl.. introduced myself to her and 7 years later we are married, bought a house and have a little girl together. 

Though it may seem like this girl fucked with your heart strings, I believe there is a certain amount of shit we must trudge through, its these types of experiences we discover what we really want. Good luck in finding what you're looking for, someone will appreciate the size of your hog."
262,"Have you tried bringing up you accidentally saw the pictures, how they made you feel, and talked through it? Your head is an echo chamber so you really aren't going to get beyond this on your own. I'm sure she'd even be willing to delete the photos if you asked. There's a chance she doesn't even remember the photos are there - I can't even remember the last time I looked at the older photos in my gallery from 6 months ago, much less over a year ago.

270,"Look, maybe we can get past the masturbating to your sister in-law, sure whatever. But you've betrayed her trust and your other half's by finding a video meant for her s/o, keeping it and then masturbating to it.

It doesn't fucking matter that it's not cheating, thats your wife's sister and that video was never meant for you and completely forgotten about.

I've been sent a picture of my ex's sister while I was still with her and my first thought was to delete it, not store it and have a fucking wank over her at a later date.

Now whenever op's wife looks at her sister she's going to think that you prefer the sister over her.

Fucking prick."
271,She kills with HEAD-shots!
272,If it was her great grandfather that'd be pretty questionable as well...

276,"I’d like to be able to say things will get better, but there’s just so much bad in this story.

1. You’ve had a thing for your SIL since before marriage.
2. You imagine what could have been, instead of devoting entirely to your wife.
3. You viewed your SIL’s video knowing it wasn’t for you, and you did it deliberately.

Some couples are cool with their partner masturbating to porn, it sounds like you were fairly aware your wife would have been unhappy and yet you knowingly went and did it anyway. And it wasn’t just any old porn, but her sister. I don’t care about your FU right now, I’d be more worried about your wife and how she must feel.

It IS possible to come back from this, but you better be prepared to work for it, and understand your wife and family may be very upset for a long while. Assuming your marriage is worth saving. I and everyone else here doesn’t know what kind of marriage you have, but you haven’t exactly painted the best picture.

Also, tracking app sounds super weird."

Propanolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that works on the brain as well as the heart and has more of the calming side effects (which is why it's prescribed for essential tremor). Also 25mg twice a day is a really low dose. I doubt the beta-blocker is doing much for you, it is all your skills.

I'm a girl and it was my time of the month and I was getting ready for PT (physical training).  I jump into my friend's car to head down to the field and I start babbling about my period and how gross it is and the clots and the farts and I turn my head . . .

Also jerking off to ""get rid of your boner"" is a nice way to make sure the boner is there to stay as your brain will basically know that once you have a boner it should keep it.

416,New position: The Grand Invigilator
417,"&gt;***Edit  by OP (credit to u/***[GizmoCharlie10](https://www.reddit.com/user/GizmoCharlie10)): UPDATE: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that’s when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it’s called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.  
&gt;  
&gt;So basically... after posting... after feeling a “bit” better by “telling someone” and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...  
&gt;  
&gt;This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn’t focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying “Call me”. I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn’t help as I didn’t focus once on Detective Pikachu.  
&gt;  
&gt;I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....  
&gt;  
&gt;On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me “fuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it”  
&gt;  
&gt;Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....  
&gt;  
&gt;I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn’t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said “sorry” but there was nothing to be “sorry” about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I’m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I’m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say “sorry”.... but didn’t know how.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife then says “I spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says “knows what?”  
&gt;  
&gt;She says “don’t lie, the video”.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was red flushed I’m sure. My heart was beating so fast.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then wife said she has deleted the video.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....  
&gt;  
&gt;Then sister-in-law speaks... she says “you do understand this video wasn’t for you”, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.  
&gt;  
&gt;But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn’t for her husband neither. He’s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he’s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it’s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates “for now”. The divorce word can never go out, but she’s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she’s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me obtaining the video didn’t come up more than once. I don’t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I’ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.  
&gt;  
&gt;For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.  
&gt;  
&gt;We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wife seemed ok for now too.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just in case OP realizes that posting this story was another fuck up.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Edit By OP's Wife:*** This is his now ex-wife.  
&gt;  
&gt;Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.  
&gt;  
&gt;I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.  
&gt;  
&gt;I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.  
&gt;  
&gt;This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.  
&gt;  
&gt;I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR: His life is ruined.

428,This would probably have helped OP if his SO didn't have a look of wonder and amazement in the pics.
429,"Not necessarily. My first time sex I didnt use a condom and lasted 20 minutes as that’s about when we stopped. Was good but didn’t come at all (good thing in hindsight I suppose).  It happens, can be nervosity or whatever. That said, paternetiy test if it ever comes to it."

432,"Well on the bright side, this sounds like a wonderful story to relive with the family years later."

436,"Honestly, you’re a really good person for telling them the truth. A lesser person would have never said anything and watched their whole family be destroyed."
437,"I'm honestly surprised he didn't get ""lost"" in the kitchen for 2 hours. I've had that happen to me in a similar situation."
438,Coming back? He didn't come to begin with.

518,That's the most painful type of boner.
519,"Depends on OP's wife and how okay she is with VR porn. For some people, that alone might be a deal breaker.

Edit: I made this comment below but I'm going to paste it here instead of replying to everyone.

I would say as long as you're faithful and devoted to your SO you're free to look at whatever porn you want. I don't see any issues with it. That's all they are now, pornographic pictures of someone you used to have sex with. Doesn't compete with the love of your life, even for a second. I wouldn't care if my girlfriend or wife watched videos of her getting gangbanged by body builders, if she wants to be with me after that then that's nothing but an ego boost for myself.

Everyone is entitled to feel how they want about it, but just because you deem something to be gross or unfaithful or whatever doesn't mean everyone's moral compass is wrong for disagreeing."

As your feet slam into the ground, the surface of the earth suddenly jerks beneath your foes feet. Select a 10x90ft line within range. Every creature in that space must make a Dexterity Save equal to your Spell Save DC or fall prone, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure.  
 
  
If a creature who failed this save is within 5ft of another creature inside the effected area who also failed, they both take an additional 1d6 of bludgeoning damage. This effect stacks for multiple creatures, for a maximum of 12d6 bludgeoning damage to a group of 9 or more adjacent creatures who all failed this check. On a successful save the damage is halved and the creature does not fall prone.

2. A separate student took it upon themselves to nefariously spread private information around without your knowledge nor consent, or anyone else's for that matter. 

3. You have to be willing to stand behind any recourse the district might threaten against the other person. Don't take the fall for someone else's stupid."
742,AITA for leaving my husband after I find him jacking it to my sister via VR?
743,"""I was devastated, I mean, I've never seen a cock that fat. I used to think about it all day, just thinking of ways to cram it in me. My mouth just salivating at the thought of trying to get that sucker down my throat. Ah... those were the days. Thanks for asking babe I appreciate it. I needed that outlet, kinda like how he used my vagina as the outlet for his ubercock. Love you babe. So, want to see Endgame tonight?"""
744,Most likely she didn't know there was one. I didn't until I saw a comment about such a thing on reddit. Most of the time they're pretty concealed probably to stop bored teens randomly shut down every escalator they see.
745,I saw that one and developed an escalator phobia for several months. It was a woman with her child. She was carrying her child and fell in but was able to pass off her child to a couple of men who were standing there as she was sucked under. It was messed up.

747,"You only have one way out of this: Make your own 360º porn video, send to sister-in-law husband and make him masturbate to you, so sister-in-law can get him in the act and divorce him to, so you can marry sister-in-law and her (now ex)husband can marry your wife."

750,"What happened next is he looked at me and I looked at him.  

I'm 19 yrs old, hungover, disheveled red hair and tiny tiny green shorts and t-shirt that the Marine Corps said ""was regulation"".  You can google ""marine corps silkies"" and see how ridiculous these things were.  

For a minute I fantasized about a funny story about ""how I met my future husband"" but he was humorless with a jaw like a battleship and just blinked at me with a blank expression.  At the time I was a lance corporal and still referring to myself in the third person, not too far from boot camp and MOS School.  

I sputtered a bunch of apologies that was really just a bunch of random words strung together and did nothing to ameliorate the situation and I jumped out of the car.  Was so embarrassed I went running down the hill to the field and when my friend dominique was like ""what happened to you i was there to pick you up you said you had cramps"" I just shrugged and whispered (as the Warrant Officer asked us to get in formation) ""yah I got in the wrong car"""

761,"If it helps, you two aren’t the first couple to have a pregnancy after prom and you won’t be the last. Although your situation might seem bleak, you will get through it as countless others have before. 

The two of you should be as honest as possible to your parents and listen to what they say. I know as a teen I think you will find the bigger problems are, the more your parents will be in “help mode” than “angry mode”"
762,"The same place I learn most things - online, somewhere. I'm the only person in my family with curly hair, so I've done a lot of Googling to figure out how to treat it right. Also, shoutout to r/curlyhair, where I'm not sure I've ever posted but I've certainly done some lurking."

788,"Also worth remembering, she may decide to keep the kid but that doesn't necessarily mean she wants you all to be a family. I get the impression you don't know each other well enough to make a decision like that, so be open to the idea of being a dad with part time custody. It might be for the best if you aren't compatible as a couple."

792,yeah just deny all knowledge but it depends what you have already said to him. It's his word versus yours so unless you have admitted it already just deny deny deny
793,Maybe he's saying he wanted to damage the door?
794,"&gt;I would avoid telling the whole story...

...like on an internet forum which is one of the most trafficked sites in the world, even going so far as to detail the date of the prospective HR meeting, making it very difficult to deny any coincidental circumstance between such a post and the events therein described?

Cause man, if HR were to find such a posting, this guy'd be extra fucked."

804,"Sometimes starting a relationship is full of so much excitement and other emotions that you forget shit. 

Years ago (2013) I was on OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and Tinder. Tinder was one of those ""ugh I feel dirty, I'm just gonna delete it"" knowing I'd come back later.  The others seemed more innocent. 

So eventually - I meet my girlfriend. We dated, and it wasn't until we agreed to be exclusive that I deleted my accounts. 

First, I deleted okcupid (actually suspended my account because I always thought it'd be cool to go back to our original chats for some anniversary gift or something). Deleted Plenty of Fish. 

At the time, I didn't have the Tinder app installed on my phone, and didn't think anything through, so there it sat. 

5 years later, one of my female friends just shoots me a friendly but accusatory PM on Facebook ""So - my roommate found you on Tinder...what's up with that?""

The first thing that went to my head was that I was drunk and activated my account. It wasn't on my phone nor was it in my search history. Okay. The next thing was that it was someone who looked like me. 

""Nope, it was definitely you - the picture from Mike's wedding is the top picture.""

Fuck - okay...so was someone fucking with me? 

She offered a solution: ""Did you not delete your account from years ago?""

I doubted it. Feeling dirty, I installed the app, was able to log right in after a quick verification, and there it was - my old debaucherous account with some cheesy pickup line from 2013. Luckily it was crystal clear that there were no shenanigans; I was fit and bearded in those pictures and since dating my girlfriend, I lost the beard and gained the weight. 

I feel like no explanation is perfectly believable, but I didn't realize that I was still ""live"" on Tinder. I'm terrified of the day when one of her friends goes ""hey, so...we know about your tinder account."" So far, so good."

808,"I wouldn't resign, I'd take two weeks leave.

One to rest and reset.

One to review your training materials.

Or just two weeks rest and discuss refresher training and review with your boss when you are back - if you nearly made a mistake so will someone else.

I run the health and safety for my company. You have had a serious near miss. Review your policies and training, and identify what went wrong. Health and safety review isnt about blame, its about finding what went wrong and stopping it happening again.

You also have 5 other people that either didn't feel comfortable speaking up or didn't know they should."

814,"I feel like this is OP scrambling for something, anything, that could possibly make it ""not his fault"" to absolutely any degree, because it so totally and plainly is his fault that he doesn't know how to handle it.

828,"As an attorney, I wonder about whether masturbation in the private confines of a bathroom stall is ""cause"" for termination. If you are an ""at will"" employee they can essentially fire you for any reason other than race, gender, sexual orientation, age (sometimes), medical condition (sometimes). If they do need cause, I think they would have a hard time claiming cause just because of the act, assuming it was in private, on break, and not using ""viewing material"". However, just in case, I would (a) not admit sexual pleasuring under any circumstances; (b) lawyer up for the hearing; (c) get a copy of the employee handbook and your contract and read them carefully. I would avoid telling the whole story...."
