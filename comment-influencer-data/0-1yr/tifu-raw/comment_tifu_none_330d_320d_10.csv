Strong start."
1,"Mom, when am I ever going to use math in real life?"
2,"This story is basically everyone's ""first time with edibles"" story. ""Ate one, nothing, ate more, nothing, oh god I'm so fucked up"""

4,This kid is going places because only a fucking legend would do that type of shit that takes balls of steel and a heart of gold
5,Edibles start working when you talk shit about them
6,"Dude come back to work. You've already done the dumbest thing possible. If you were not fired you need to just stick it out. There is no direction but up from here, unless you manage to deep fry all the registers. You good."
7,On the unethical bright side.... Dan probably doesn't blame you and is upset with his mom instead. 
8,"You blew it, man. You had your opportunity.

Should have just snuck over to her brother's room earlier, and then when her dad found you, said you were dating him. "
9,"I've been with my SO for 13 years now.

If someone complimented her appearance, outfit, and offered her a bucket of chicken, I'm not 100% sure it wouldn't work on her."
10,"A data center I worked in had a button that if pressed would release fire suppressants and cost like  $70,000 to  replace."
11,Thought it was gonna end with op catcalling a random woman that looked like his wife
12,"Used to do drywall touch ups for a home builder. We'd do them after the homeowners would move in.

Once every 25 or 30, I'd run into a homeowner that apparently had the same instincts. I'd spread my joint compound nice and smooth and walk away to clean my tools and inevitably, I'd walk past my work and it would now have a fresh finger print in it.

I don't understand the need to press things that you don't understand. I don't walk up to my mother in law and randomly press her forehead."
13,Give it another 5 years and this will be a fucking LEGEND in your family lmao
14,Sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two liter of soda chatting up plus sized women. This is one of the best stories I've read on Reddit. Thank you.
15,"&gt; She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn’t always listen so that worries me.

This seems suspicious, if I was the dad I would be thinking ""hmmmm I tried the door to her room and then randomly got a text from her about the door being locked like she knew I tried the door... hmmmmm..... hmmmmmmmmmm.... hmmmmmmmmm... hm.hm.hm.hm....... hmmmmmmm"""
16,"Just be genuine about your apology man. No need to wordsmith it, just own it and hopefully she will come around"
17,how did you manage not to push the fucking button
18,"I misread this as “TIFU by calling my cat my wife” and was thoroughly disappointed by the lack of cats. 

0/10 needs more cats."
19,"I’m currently awake in the middle of the night in an anxiety induced state thinking about a speech I have to give tomorrow and this is exactly what I needed to read to calm down enough to go back to sleep.  Even if I royally fuck up,  there’s no way I can call the cops 348 times during my speech. Thank you for this. 

Update for those asking: I nailed the speech! I guess there really is some good in every misfortune, thanks OP.  "

21,Is your Dads name Tywin Lannister or something? 
22,"My first day working in a restaurant, I made tea (one of the giant vats of tea) when it was already full. I turned the machine on and walked away. When I came back, tea was spilling all over the kitchen floor and people were furiously mopping it up and the manager was yelling ""who made tea on top of tea??? Who did this???"" Everyone messes up when they're new. You'll laugh about it soon. 

Edit: Wow, TIL that virtually everyone has made the same type of mistake. I don't feel quite so dumb anymore lol"
23,Inb4 Dad uses reddit and reads this
24,Thank God he cleared that up for me
25,I think your first problem is you're a procrastinating perfectionist.

So get married 4 months in and buy a car with a high APR?"
30,"It's like they fucking know. 

I'm a weak ass bitch eh? Let's just forget every verb we know for awhile."
31,"I think it’s funny you bought weed named after the us gov program that creates psychotic people for your first legal experience. 

Welcome to thunderdome! "

33,"I've encountered exactly one woman who - if I married I would very seriously consider changing my last name to hers because I would never get tired of the name ""Brian Broadsword""."
34,"I would actually report the mould to whatever your local health agency is, it can be pretty bad. Do so anonymously of course, perhaps call from a payphone."
35,"I'd own it. Talk about a healthy happy marriage, and how attraction and affection are a gift from God. Make fun of yourself a little for getting carried away. I think it's important that people know she's your wife, the touching was loving and consensual, and the only negative was bad timing. Otherwise, rumors could build and turn a humorous mistake into a scandal. I also think that if, like most Christian churches, you're going to tell kids not to be sexual outside of marriage, it's important to model and acknowledge that sexuality within a marriage can be a happy, passionate thing. "
36,Sure but did your tea get surrounded by police officers
37,"Just a side note, from another Swede: I have a relative who became seriously saddened when both my sister and my female cousins took their respective husbands' name. He didn't blame them, but you could tell that it makes him sad.

There's approximately ten people left in the world with our surname, and I think that the connection between the different branches of our family is a very big thing to this guy. When he grew up, his branch of the family wasn't very close to the rest, and he made a conscious effort to bring the family together later in life.

I guess what I'm trying to get to is that for some people, a common surname can carry a lot of weight, and people even like to construct a history about a clan-like structure. It's in no way an excuse to act like your dad did, but you'd be surprised how emotional people can be about these things."
38,The same time when you use meth
39,"When you trash talk the brownie, then the brownie trashes you.

You: ""This brownie ain't shit""

Brownie: ""Bet. Watch this."""
40,"I don't think you really messed up. You got unlucky. Dan took it a touch too far. Whoever put up that flyer overreacted. Your sister overreacted as well and used you as a scapegoat.

You were being a good uncle. You cared about your nephew and tried to help him out. Things turned sour but I don't think it's your fault."
41,"Wow! Of all the horror stuff one can introduce, you went with the most scariest thing possible for your kids.

Good luck spending money on therapy though"
42,"Holy fuck, if anything, you and G are fucking heroes for discovering the bombs. And the fucking metal poking out of the ground was a torpedo and nobody, even the ones who set up the golf course, knew it was a torpedo? Holy shit your town would've been like Megaton in Fallout 3 "

Andy and April, is that you?"
44,You need to show up for work and excel to make it up to your classmate. Would be super rude for you to no-show.
45,"Anyone can pass as gay. Just say ""I'm gay"" it's like magic"
46,Simple weed math man. Its not rocket appliances. 
47,Yeah but who are they married to? 
48,Tell them it's your bed and it was made for you drr drr drr
49,"I worked in a movie theater for 7 years. Popper fires happen. I was a manager and we never fired any staff that caused one of these fires. I think your bosses will understand that mistakes happen when it gets busy. 

Edit: I forgot to mention, there's no WAY your bosses are firing you this close to the holiday rush. You'll likely get reprimanded and might require the entire staff to do emergency training or something, but if you're remotely competent at your job, they'll keep you around at least through December. "

54,You’ve got a future as a Morse code operator
55,Most women hate being catcalled.

We don't need eagle eyes for this one."
60,"They usually have covers you have to lift or break.    Theres also emergency power off buttons in data centers that will cut power to millions of dollars of equipment at once.  Not the most destructive thing but it would require massive recovery time to bring everything back up and lots of money lost.  There are always horror stories of a cleaning crews bumping uncovered ones with mops or someone too curious for their own good hitting them, though. 

Most people are smart enough not to be that guy."
61,"I worked in a call center once upon a time. A girl brought brownies and offered me one. I scarfed the whole thing like the fat little piggy I am. A few minutes later she asked me where my brownie went, I informed her that I ate said brownie. 

She said ""uhhh... Dude you weren't supposed to eat the whole thing""

""What? Why?""

""Because I told you they were magic brownies, aka pot brownies. Haven't you ever had them before?""

""Oh? No. I thought magic brownie meant that they were just extra good""

Hence I lost my edible virginity to a strange girl at work. After a few more minutes she panicked a little and said I should probably go home sick. I felt like that was a good idea, informed the supervisor, and split. After driving a little ways down the road everything got all wavey and it felt like my eyes were breathing. So I called my sister and she came and saved me. I went home and put some music on and went to bed. The music sounded so real and alive. It was beautiful. I started experimenting with psychedelics just to listen to music. 3-MeO was my favorite until I took a little too much and accidentally saw the face of god. Now I don't mess with things like that. But I do miss the extra sounds that music had.

tl:dr. I hope my state legalizes."
62,At least you raised awareness of the issue. It wasn't a good thing to handle it but discovering it may have saved lives if someone less fortunate messed with one
63,"&gt; I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can’t really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. 

Why didn't you just leave instead of getting food??"
64,Just tell her you think of her as a second mother or some shit and that’s why you responded that way. 
65,"Get out there, make tea, wake him up and establish dominance."
66,"There's actually one at a nearby gas station, but my doctor said he'd contact the right people for me anyway."
67,Your cat must have been *pissed*
68,"No, no. Anxiety is not your friend. Anxiety has no friends. "
69,It would probably worked on me...
70,"Quoting my word for word exclamation when I read the headline:

# Why the fuck would you do this?"
71,"Kids are the worst man, sorry they treated you like that. I was in the same situation and the other kids in my class would not leave me alone after the saw some blood in the corner of my mouth"
72,"You know all those cartoons you see about people trying to go to sleep and their ""scumbag brain"" reminding them of all the times they screwed up and humiliated themselves? This is going to be your moment.

Your brain will not let you forget this, and that's a good thing, because it will help you remember not to press buttons if you don't know what they do."
73,There are two left in the world
74,No he passed away at the ripe old age of 18 (and not of kidney failure) 
75,"&gt;Anyone can pass as gay. Just say ""I'm gay"" it's like magic

"
76,Payphone? Those still a thing?
77,"Seriously WTF? If I was Dad, tried opening my Daughters room door, found out it was locked, AND THEN GOT A RANDOM TEXT FROM HER AT SCHOOL SAYING SHE WOULD UNLOCK IT?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you NOT raise an eyebrow?"
78,That's pretty damn fast considering that's the consistent speed for 2 minutes. Assuming she either slowed or didnt start off full throttle (cause who would) or both the peak clicks per second gets pretty high
79,"Or maybe it's all a **LIE**

Nooo... not on the internet."
80,It was just an accident and i hope your boss understands.
81,"Exactly. The parents should really turn this into a lesson for Dan about social cues, consent, and where to draw the line instead of a grounding him. "

90,"Damn, you put your surname on the internet! Aren’t you worried someone might dox you? "
91,"""I got a bucket a chicken. Ya wanna do it?"""
92,"I don’t have a source but I recall reading something about people with perfectionistic traits tending to procrastinate more than people without the perfectionistic traits. Something about trying to avoid making low quality product (if you aren’t producing anything, there can’t be any mistakes!).

95,yeah tbh I think the boy is a grade a BA and the store is staffed by a bunch of busy bodies.
96,"Came here to clear up the dosage confusion, too. Good on ya.  41mg is a pretty good dose, for me, but yeah - eating 4 of those fuckers is gonna be a wild ride. 

edit; since the guy I replied to deleted his comment for some reason, he was pointing out that OP's calculation of 232mg per brownie is 232mg of raw weed, while most dosages you see on edibles are actual THC.  He calculated it out to about 41mg of THC per brownie based on the potency of the strain OP mentioned, which is still a fairly strong edible."
97,"Which to me sounds pretty stupid. He basically got grounded for asking girls out, and when he finally started to have some success it got taken away from him."
98,Looks like me and anxiety have something in common 
99,"Being cat-called has never made me feel pretty. 

Although I did get some nice schadenfreude when a guy cat-calling me rear-ended the car in front of him as it had stopped for a red light.

100,Who the hell brings illegal drugs to work and just hands them out randomly to people she barely knows?!? Yeah let's just walk around offering illegal drugs to people WCGW
101,"I find it funny that the things men do “to compliment women” or “make them feel pretty” etc. are things that *men* would want a woman to do to them. I realized this when talking to a gay friend of mine about grindr. I asked him how that whole situation goes and he said “usually I just send a dick pick and maybe meet up later that night” and it hit me, the tactics that men use (i.e unsolicited dick picks) would really only work to pick up other men lol. It’s almost like men (not all men, of course) can’t see beyond “well, it would work on me”. "
102,Hold on! Doesnt her Dad find it suspicious that his daughter texts him about the door lock and keys when shes at school? How does she Even know he tried to open it...without someone telling her that?
103,Thank you! .... Now i just hope it ends well.

110,"I babysat some pre-teens once who begged me for a scary story. I started out with *Harold* from Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark and the one about the dog that turns out to be a sewer rat with rabies, thinking they would love it. They were completely unimpressed, so I started showing them progressively scarier and scarier stuff in a desperate attempt to instill one iota of fear. I showed them Pyramid Head’s scene in the Silent Hill movie, the video from The Ring, and Marbled Hornets, after which I flat-out told them Slenderman was absolutely real and I had seen him in our backyard because I had ran out of ideas. 

I couldn’t scare those kids for nothing. The looks on their apathetic faces still haunt me."
111,If it makes you feel any better. I'm a Chinese father. And I sure as fuck would kill you if I saw you lol
112,Their husband's and wives
113,"While I think there is a place for everything... I question why you'd think Japanese psychological horror would be a good idea to introduce to kids that young.

That stuff triggers base and primal fears...

*Edit: I'm not saying it was wrong to share what you enjoy with your kids... but damn, those comics trigger deep-seated and primal fears even in older people. I just hope you've not left a lingering fear of the genre on your kids.*"
114,Good question. If things never get resolved I'd probably resent the maiden name and keep the current name. Or I could take my mum's last name. That'd be funny because my first name is named after her maiden name so I'd have the same name as first and last. 
115,"Lol, I thought of that. The dispensary was selling it under the 'relax' category though"
116,Is the cat still alive?

119,You rubbed salt in a blister? Wtaf?
120,"I’m a little worried for OPs job. Before reading I thought OP was going to say he started a small fire that was quickly put out, as some fire related TIFUS go. But it seems he essentially shut down business and probably created a fair amount of angry customers.

However, it seems like he handled it safety and professionally after it started, hopefully his boss takes that into account. "

122,Ha! Too late! I've already found every Smith and I'm going to go TP their apartment!

124,Worst case ontario you get two birds stoned at once.
125,At least you didn’t fuck your sister... but then the family name would be safe 
126,"But that actually takes effort. Grounding is simpler, and is known to work 100% of the time."

130,Don't forget a drinking problem
131,It sounds like you were okay but that's pretty messed up for her not to explicitly say they were pot brownies! 
132,I totally agree with this! If my pastor did this and responded to the congregation like this I would be impressed with how he handled the situation and have a lot of respect for him and his wife and the example they set. 
133,What a Chad. 
134,"This is obviously the correct response. The restaurant still needs personnel and they’ve already trained OP.  Just deal with it, it’s a restaurant, everyone has embarrassing stories."
135,"I made it clear in my family that I wanted to change my name as my biological father was a POS human being.   Well I get married and when our officiant announced us, everyone gasped because I took the wife’s name.  My family is very religious so they got a 1, 2 punch of it being a non religious wedding and me taking my wife’s last name.   Even had a few walk outs.   Its like they thought I wasn’t serious when I said I was changing my name.   Would have done it earlier, but man, it’s expensive without doing it in marriage. 

Of course, this is the same family who thinks I’m still in my rebellious phase against religion since I was 14.   I’m 29 now.  

Also, it’s just a contract to combine assets.   I mean seriously, people take marriage to be some kind of religious BS thing.  Your legally becoming a single entity.  That’s it."

138,Calling popcorn kernels seed is something I had never thought of before.
139,"Yeah I think hanging a warning flier because a young dude is chatting up women is a huge overreaction. Unless he's really pushing way too hard or being a total asshole like ""hey fatty want some food?"" they definitely overreacted. 

As far as I can see though, OP gave his nephew some good advice. "

145,"OMG..... I can so relate. My son saw that I was a little (a lot) nervous about the surgery his father was about to have. So he suggests that I try some of the cough syrup mixed with marijuana he had.  He measured it out into a spoon for me. And as I'm swallowing this stuff he says, I normally take two spoons full of this and it F\*cks me up. I looked at him like he's crazy, because he knows that I have never had anything to do with marijuana EVER.  Long story short. I never made it to the hospital to sit and wait while my husband had surgery.....I could NOT move for the next 10 hours. All I could do was sit and stare, and contemplate life. Every thought I had was....Why? Why does the walls keep moving? or why are humans even on this planet? etc... WEED IS A POWERFUL DRUG!!! lol

165,"Please get him tested for ADHD. I know people's knee-jerk reaction is usually ""oh shut up he's just being a kid!"", but there is a massive difference between just being a kid and being a kid who can't control or predict their own impulses.

I did the same chronic stuff-touching when I was young, and got the same endless stream of attempts to correct me from adults, but I had about as much control over the behavior as you'd have over blinking or breathing. Imagine growing up being constantly lectured and punished for blinking too often. You try your hardest to hold your eyes open and eventually you get to where you can hold it for whole minutes, maybe, but then you always end up blinking again no matter how hard you try not to. And your mom says you're not trying enough and *why can't you just not blink, it's not that difficult, what's wrong with you.* You don't know what's wrong with you. You're trying everything you can but your body just acts on its own. You figure you must be a bad, worthless person for not being able to do simple things like not blink. 

Go through this every day for 20+ years until your sense of sanity and self-worth are in tatters. That's untreated ADHD."

But the part my mom loves to tell is that when I did finally come home, she, (somehow the only one on the entire island not to know what has happened) asks me what I've did that day and why I don't have my bike I, always understated, simply answered ""found a bomb"" as I walked up to my room. She didn't find out what really happened until Gs dad called after he was able to return to his home. "

193,"My grandfather was on the ship just off the shore of Eniwetok when the h-bomb went off and he was the one responsible for testing the radiation levels. He worked for FEMA and closely beside Clinton for years. I remember him saying they had no idea how big and bright the blast would be.they had to turn around from the blast with special goggles on close their eyes and cover their goggles with their hands. He said the blast was so bright he could see through his eyelids through the goggles the bones and tendons in his hand like an x-ray. 

Edit: it looks like the thread is locked so I'll respond on here. Yes he and a lot of his fellow shipmates that were there that day died of cancer (my gpas was from smoking apparently) but he said a lot of his friends' we're from weird tumors popping up later in life. No idea if that's true or not. Like someone else said, the blast was 2.5x bigger at least than they thought and they should have been miles and miles farther away. Especially the fact that he went and tested the radiation level after. He said a lot of weird lizards survived it without a problem those were the only wildlife he saw when he was there (I always joked that they were the new 3-headed species). For those that pm'd me, yes he was in charge of bringing the current president underground in one of the many bunkers in case of nuclear war (it's nuts down there everything was on springs including the toilet), and he wrote speeches for the president on the technical aspects of his job that Bill Clinton would relay to the public. He was a shitty grandpa but an amazing man that led an incredible life, he wrote a very R rated book about some things in his life but it was fascinating. "

200,"Never ate too much on accident, but I have on purpose lol. Roomie and I ate 100mg each one night. Started cooking right after so by the time they kicked in we would have a hot meal ready. We both had been practicing intermittent fasting for awhile, so I guess it hit us faster than the usual hour or so. Before it hit we decided to brown up some ground beef, green peppers, ancho peppers, tomato, let it simmer, then serve it over a bed of rice cooked sepretaly. When it started to simmer we decided it needed something else, so we through a can of beans into the mix. 30ish minutes in and he asks if he can stir because he really needs something to focus on or he is gonna lose it. I look at him, then the pan, then him, then the pan. Then I say "" Nah man, I can't stop. This is my own tether to reality. Find your own...but you know what I just realized man? This is just fucking chilli on rice!""

Roomie: We weren't high when we came up with this right?

Me: Nope

Both: ooooooh noooo *laughter ensues*

201,"Probably the employees saw out the window what Dan was up to. If you watch Dateline on NBC, it definitely seems suspicious. 


Also, alot of big women tend to be suspect about guys randomly hitting on them, because they feel like they're seen as easy targets. (i.e. more likely to put themselves at risk because they aren't used to being hit on often.) 


Edit: I know a few big girls and the ones I know tend to feel, when they're hit on, like the guy is trying to use the fact that she's probably not often hit on to his advantage to get her in bed.


Edit 2: I'm talking about guys operating under the assumption that big girls are DTF anyone, anytime, because they *must* be desperate from lack of attention. This is different from trying to get to know someone because you're interested in them as a person. "

217,"tbh, I'd leave it and pretend I never saw it. The homeowner knew what they did. Let it set up. Then when you come back later to paint over it, inform the homeowner that you have to chisel it out and re-do it (for extra charge since it takes extra time) or you could just leave it and they could have their finger mark in the wall if they wanted. They'll learn fast."

220,"My Mom went to Colorado a few years ago after legalization and had trouble sleeping due to hip pain, so after me talking her through what to do she sends me a picture that’s like “look!! I bought a whole bag of cookies!!”. They were the size of those tiny little cookies that came in McDonalds happy meals in the 90’s...there were probably a dozen in there. I had to warn her to eat JUST one, then wait at least an hour. If she felt absolutely nothing, she could have a second. I couldn’t imagine letting my Mom go through a first edibles experience similar to mine that had me shivering, heart racing, muttering about this being “the end”, and rocking back and forth at an 85 degree summer Jimmy Buffet concert...with my ex-cop Dad there too. Lungs be damned, edibles are not for me, I’m old school and will probably always just smoke it. I like the sense of control. My Mom smuggled the rest back for me (to an illegal state) where I ended up giving them to a coworker, whose father was dying of cancer, so he could have some kind of appetite. At least they went to a good cause."

246,"Well, I'd say that perfectionism is an excuse for procrastination, **but that’s not entirely true because there are two distinct types of perfectionism!** 

There’s either intrinsic or extrinsic perfectionism. One’s a self-oriented perfectionism, while the other is a socially-prescribed perfectionism. Self-oriented perfectionists are people that do things well for themselves because they feel innate satisfaction by working hard to accomplish things to the best of their ability. 

Intrinsic perfectionists are generally fine getting negative feedback or being outright insulted because they have a growth based mindset. They love what they do and they love improving at whatever it is they enjoy because it brings them satisfaction. These types of perfectionists tend to be aware of this, and also tend to have higher willpower and commitment to their tasks and goals, and as such don’t possess any inherent procrastination “risk factors.” 

Meanwhile, socially-prescribed perfectionists are mostly trying to do things well just because they’re trying to live up to someone else’s expectations and standards. I think many can relate to that feeling of having a voice in your head that says *“Pfft, you could’ve done THAT way better”* over and over ad nauseam. 

**This type of socially-prescribed perfectionism is often what leads to that negative self-talk, anxiety, demotivation, and procrastination, as this perfectionism is often based off a very strong fear of failure and even stronger sense of personal inadequacy.**

So if you describe yourself as a perfectionist, can you please pause and take a few moments to ask yourself what’s your flavour of perfectionism? Are you self-oriented and enjoy improving, or are you trying to live up to some type of standard? If you worked really hard on something, yet everybody hated it, would you view it as an opportunity to grow, or as an embarrassing defeat? Are your standards even reasonable or attainable? Are your standards constantly applied and raised higher and higher, so you never feel like you succeed? If you’re just trying to live up to some socially-prescribed standard, what can you do to alleviate that? 

Basically, self-oriented perfectionists are people that desire to be great at what they do because they genuinely enjoy learning and improving to create the best thing possible. However, socially-prescribed perfectionists do so because they have to live up to a standard and feel a strong fear of failure that usually stems from an often misplaced sense of personal inadequacy.
