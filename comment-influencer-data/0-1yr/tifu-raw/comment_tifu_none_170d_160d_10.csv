0,The cheating wife berating you for being insensitive is the funniest part of it all lmaoooooo
1,Scrotch tape
2,We are *definitely* gonna need an update on this
3,"Any can plant a seed, very few will stay to raise a strong tree.

Please tell your Dad you love him and he is your Dad regardless of everything."
4,You know he spent the whole rest of winter break trying to come up with the perfect pick-up line...
5,At least she didn't walk in and start celebrating. 
6,Its unfortunate that band aids for mens nuts havent been invented yet. 
7,"If there's nothing about your problem on the internet, there's a high chance you are just stupid"
8,Why would the cheating wife be there for this??
9,"Call your dad, make it clear you still see him as your father could really help him out."
10,"To quote Yondu, ""He may have been your father boy, but he wasn't your Daddy""

Hope you get through this."
11,"My soul left my body when I read the title, but had to return multiple times so that it could be violently ejected once again at each new paragraph.

Don't switch gynos! He sounds amazing, and it sounds like you'll be able to laugh it off with him once you've relived it a mere 60 more times in your head between now and your next pap smear."
12,"Who gets the whole family together to tell them they're getting divorced? How weird. 

Also, anybody who makes big announcements on April 1st is just asking for it. You did nothing wrong. "
13,"&gt; A blob of what I hope is lube 

If it wasn't lube, prepare for a five star review on yelp

&amp;#x200B;"
14,"is it wrong to ask for an update? very curious how everything turns out.


Your dad realizing his isn't your dad but your uncle, Grandparents now involved, its all such a weird situation. "
15,"""Mom, how did you and dad meet?  Dad said to ask you."""
16,and no one said a thing. I definitely feel like im on the bottom rung of the totem pole
17,"according to her new partners soon to be ex wife, she was actually caught on top."
18,"God, I’m so glad you didn’t fuck this up further. I’m happy for you, OP. "
19,"It was her decision to divorce. my brother in law is still open to working things out, but she is planning on starting over with the guy she had an affair with. 

As poor of a decision as this seems to be, I think she realizes that she is going to have some limited contact with this side of the family over the years.
"
20,When my grandma died her husband kept using her phone but didn’t tell anyone. 6 months after she died I got a call from her but I guess he butt dialed me because I picked up and just heard static and a muffled voice on the other end. Freaked me the fuck out
21,At least you didnt die and got off that habit man.  Drinking like that will kill you for sure as well.  I got bad withdrawals too when i quit drinking.  Im glad you are alive and stay sober its obvious you have a lot of people that love you =-)
22,Just made some guys fantasty come true. 
23,Should've whipped out the helicopter
24,Thank you for being brave enough to give us the photograph for proof. Love it. 
25,Clicked on this cause the title led me to believe that you thought your own divorce was a joke. This was still a great read though. That shits on them for choosing that day. 
26,Well I wish more people would say nice things about my ankles 
27,"I'm really sorry for your loss OP. Although, it's so wholesome to think when they answered the call, who they though was your brother, was actually his son. Almost like part of your brother was the one calling."
28,"She picks up the phone ""Rachel, the sonofabitch finally did it!! You get the champaign and I'll call those brothers we met at the bar last week"""
29,"Not your fuck up. They were grown adults and knew what they were doing. It's a shit way to find out, and the fallout isn't gong to be great, but imagine this coming out later.

You know now, and can make plans based on truth. Don't beat yourself up over it. "
30,Nice. Well if it does swell. You can tell the misses your gonna give her a good sting
31,I had something similar happen to me but it was in a grocery store and my boobs fell out of my dress that wasn't buttoned properly. No one said anything to me about it then and I've seen the same cashiers since and although I die a little on the inside it seems like they don't even remember the incident. I'm sure the people in your class should react the same way.. unless they're dicks lol 
32,He probably spent half the time thinking if what he heard was enough of a clear signal that she likes him. The guy way.
33,"I'm literally in the waiting room for a testicular ultrasound right now and I'm kind of scared/paranoid that it's cancer.  Reading this really helped reset and calm me down.  Thanks!  

Also, this is just going to be a funny/proud story for him later; I wouldn't freak out too much."
34,"Yeah man don’t assume blame. Get into contact and support your dad. Let him know that you don’t care about the test results and to you, he will always be your dad. He is going to need a ton of support from you right now. His wife and own family betrayed him for the past 20 years at least and he didn’t even know it. Find him and help him. Since you are an adult, try to get him through it as if it was one of your friends going through some major shit. Just try to reinforce that you two will get through it and try to perk him up a bit. "
35,Had to go back and reread some sentences because I was unsure whether “little bastard” referred to the wasp or OP’s vinegar dick.
36,Big question is how old is OP. If you’re an adult or close to one then fuck it. You called your cold mom out on a horrendous lie and biology or not your dad still raised you. You still have that bond with him and that doesn’t change. He just raised another man’s child as his own but once that initial sting wears off you both will still be ok. 
37,"I’m kind of shocked you could comfortably relax in Epsom salts with an open wound.

That shit burns. "
38,"I'd say the dad is the main victim here, with the double betrayal and the fact that his offspring not being truly his. That probably shakes something deeply engraved by our evolution.

As for OP, I totally understand your anger over the lie, but consider the fucked up fact that you wouldn't exist if it hadn't happened. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
39,"&gt; About a week later, a check for about 100 bucks comes for me in the mail from the city, which was of course from the cop guys 

Wait, what is this all about?! Like you get a refund from the police if they screw up and arrest you by accident?

&amp;#x200B;"
40,"&gt; Not your fuck up. They were grown adults and knew what they were doing.

I know I'm going to sound like that thin friend stuffing in a bar of chocolate saying ""I don't really have to watch my weight"", but that's how I feel here: Not having inadvisable sex with people when you could is piss easy. It's easy sober; it's easy drunk; it's easy high. 

Step one: Don't kiss people you shouldn't be kissing.

Step two: If you find yourself being kissed by a person you shouldn't be kissing; put your hand on their chest, gently push them away and tell them ""thanks, but no.""

Step three: Go home and masturbate. This step is important.

Optional step four (if you still feel deeply dissatisfied and unhappy): rethink your life choices. "
41,lmfao I might have had she not spoke up
42,and who brings the cheating wife to this sort of function?
43,Testiclasp ® 
44,Some dude in the class was thinking “titties pop out” and now thinks he has telekinesis or something.
45,Great. If this ultrasound gig doesn't work then I've been thinking of opening a massage parlor. 
46,"Happened to me freshman year.  I was swimming with this guy that liked me and our families because he was a family friend.  My bikini top snaps open and I flashed my family friend, his little brother, his parents, and my parents.  Great for the guy that was into me, horribly awkward for everyone else.  Don't wear string bikinis.  "
47,Shane Dawson wants to know your location 
48,Is the cucumber used to verify the butt cheeks are separated ?
49,I think she is/was on bottom
50,He won't be able to second anything.
51,Try using vegetable oil and a cucumber.
52,"He may not be your father, but he's yo daddy, boy. "
53,Adhesticle ^tm 
54,"""Oh, I knew my daughter didn't marry you for your brains."""
55,"To also quote Yondu, “When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I saved your life!”"
56,"On behalf of men: We understand and dont want to stare, but we´re programmed to do so. Its not even a thought-process involved"
57,"I have to admit, I was a little hesitant at first. I’m glad that you appreciate it, it’s certainly the weirdest photo that I have of myself lol"
58,tbh I'd peg him if he's into it
59,"My dad passed away when I was younger (35 as well), and a couple years later I got my drivers license. My mom called my phone to see what I was out doing, and when I answered she said my dads name in a question kind of way. I was like “uhhh no?”, and I heard her tone get kind of sad, and she said “Oh, you sounded just like your dad when you answered” with a small chuckle at the end. 

It was a wholesome moment that made me sad about it all over. :(

My brother got my dads old phone number when he got a phone, and that was a whole other adjustment. A couple times I forgot and thought he was calling from beyond the grave."
60,"Umm, it was Moses that split the Red Sea. Noah was the boat dude.

Source: Am Noah."
61,I second this. 
62,That's a story you wouldn't tell your kids but happy tell your grandkids
63,I'm 19
64,"As a step child this comment really hit home. My (step) dad raised me a lot more than my bio ever did. Love makes a family, not always DNA"
65,"In less polite terms you could call it a bribe. Just a way for the cops to clear their conscience on that, really. Probably felt bad about scaring the crap out of the guy."
66,"oh I am insensitive, but you've been fucking the neighbor!"
67,Oh that would be sooo cute
68,That story is nuts. Spot on. 
69,"~~Rub n Tug~~

**Zap n Fap**"
70,"You both have to be INCREDIBLY CAREFUL about ever drinking alcohol again. If you ever get addicted again, getting off it without killing your self gets exponentially harder. Magnify your withdrawal symptoms by a factor of ten, hence the whole death thing. I went from drinking a bottle of gin a day for 2 years to sober in about two weeks. After I passing out from withdrawals I quit doing the whole “cold turkey” thing. I bought a small bottle of whiskey and a small bottle of jagermister. I sipped on them in ice cold shot glasses until I could get though the whole day on only one and then I quit. Fast forward 3 years and life takes a turn for the worst. My sobriety takes a 3/4 of a bottle of whiskey every day hit to the gut. Fast forward another year and my health is starting to go downhill fast and I need to quit. Anyway long story short replay level one again only this time it takes 4 months of “quitting” to get past the withdrawals. 3 months past alcohol passing my lips and I’m still physically fucked, I can almost walk a mile without falling over and dialing 911. please take my first hand advice and BE CAREFUL. "
71,"I had to show my penis to a super attractive doctor the other day, we’re about the same age as well and i give her mad props for looking me dead in the eye and shaking my hand afterwards. One of the most awkward experiences iv ever been in."
72,See if you can get him to let you fuck him in the ass
73,lol my father in law is an absolute champ he would have started stripping on the other end himself
74,Me too! Thanks :D
75,The amount of euphemisms in this story is too damn high!!!
76,"Reddit is going to love this you checked every box for these dudes. 1. Girl 2. Titties 3. DD 4. Tits out


RIP to your inbox and good luck"
77,"I hear ""boobs"" and ""dicks"" get along well, though. "
78,Spermabond™ 
79,sounds like everything you do in this family is an open book
80,He willed it with his mind 
81,"All too true, I was a poly sci major"
82,9 out of 10 dentists would not recommend doing this.
83,Proboubly why the bleeding started again. Epsom salts draws stuff out.
84,Long showers and throwaway accounts; such a wonderful combo. 
85,By far the weirdest part. 
86,"I was fired on April 1st (years ago).

Really, pick a different day, everyone. "
87,"The only person at fault is your mother. *She* is the one who cheated. You don't need to feel guilty about exposing her guilt. Also, your real dad is the guy who raised you, not the guy whose genes are more similar. "
88,I'm also confused. Why would they give you $100?
89,"&gt;  hand to gland combat

That is the most uncomfortably awkward metaphor for masturbation I've ever come across."
90,Why would they announce this in April fools? It's like announcing you're pregnant. Just wait a day.
91,"When he went home I wonder if he mentioned you to his parents.

Have you met anybody nice, son?

Well, I do know this girl who would let me put it in her butt.

Wow, kid. That's love. Congratulations.

Thanks Dad."
92,I hope your procedure goes uhmm better?? Best of luck that it is nothing serious. 
93,"I never felt more stupid than when I was looking for a ""DY"" laptop and realized it was HP after coming across one solitary Yahoo Answers post."
94,"Yeah, it’s like:

My Adult brain: Oh, how awful. The poor woman must be so embarrassed. 

My teen brain: BOOBIES!!!"
95,"My two luscious scoops of ice cream, each topped with a juicy cherry, sprang forth from the confines of my sports bra like a cat startled by a barking canine, and waved like so many hands in a parade for all the world to see."
96,Thank you for posting a real TIFU and not another thinly veiled /r/writingprompt submission
97,"I don't know her, but she sounds pretty heartless. I hope Tim's better off without her."
98,"I'm glad my story was able to give you and out of body experience! I feel like my own soul is in orbit somewhere. I cringed so hard, I feel as if my ow asshole turned inside out."
99,if you thought they were broken why would you not return them? who sits on a expensive headset if you was to believe it didn't work?
100,Everyone telling OP to reconnect with dad probably not getting that this dude is GONE. and a half.
101,Jesus man lol what a shitfest! Good on you for checking up on her tho!
102,"Maybe you should call your grandparents and see if you can stay with them a few days until things calm down. 

Not your fault though. Your mom had to realize that this would come to light eventually, it just happened sooner than she expected. "
103,TIFU by cuming on my ultrasound technicians face.
104,Made even creepier by the genuine look of joy at saying what you think is a perfectly normal compliment and in no way out of the ordinary or suggests you dine on people. 
105,"sadly he isn't going to be. She is(was) an amazing mother. 
Bread winner, super involved at home and in the kids lives. Always planning family events. I love tim like a brother, but she was my favorite."
106,Must've been pretty hard...
107,"What if you achieved your goal, and this is still one big hallucination? :O"
108,"Bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off"
109,At least it wasn't the father 
110,"This. Support the dad please, he raised and he had was deceived more than you :/"
111,"Hey, I like your ankles! "
112,"Just wait before asking, dated a girl that asked if she could, we hadn't even had sex yet, I was shocked, and all I could say was ""can we start with the boring stuff first, I don't want to know what we do a few years down the road to spice things up if a strap on is your starting point."""
113,"my mother inlaw has next cameras... I know I set them up. 

there is actually one covering the dining room table and exterior door there. 

Should I ask her for the footage? Or is that another fuck up?"
114,"Why would you change doctors? He's cool, you're cool, and that's not the last time the apprentice is going to find something objectionable in her future professional life, so she'll have to learn to deal with it.

Good story."
115,Are your boys okay though
116,"I don't believe that. He may be gone from the mom's life but I can't see someone who is that broken up over a betrayal like that just abandoning their innocent child. And even if he's not his *biological* child, he's still basically his *adoptive* child that he raised and loved and loves him back. 

I don't think that's how it's gonna go down. "
117,Pretty sure I watched this video last night 
118,It normally isn't a big deal after a normal scan but it was a hard to even talk to him after this disaster. 
119,"two dudes strip for wife/daughter, sounds like a very weird pornhub post"
120,He can't type right now his mistress said no.
121,Depends on how much the karma is worth to you
122,If he's like most any dudeever then that is what he did. 
123,"Ahhha a few months after my grandpa died my grandma took over his Facebook because she didn’t know how to make her own, it was so bizarre seeing my grandpas name pop up randomly liking and commenting on things. We all freaked out briefly before figuring it out and helped her change the name on it. "
124,Cat: TIFU and took a shower with human.
125,"Alcohol detox is the most dangerous, never do it alone, and do it gradually."
126,So she was actually able to see it this time?
127,"Nah, getting rid of the wax is high energy consumptive process - the cucumber to be used to restore the energy level (eat)"
128,"Hello Allstate, so this life insurance policy does pay out in cases of suicide, right?"
129,"“The worst part about that was I feel like I did that with my mind, ‘cause the whole time she was dancing I was thinking: ‘Come on, titty!  Come on, TITTY!”

- Dave Chappelle "
130,No it’s called a lie. 
131,Look at me. Look at me. I'm the butt-fucker now.
132,Breast friends you might say. 
133,"^ This is important. Remember this, OP. "
134,"Doctors hate him for that one, simple, penis-enlarging trick."
135,"Damn man! I feel so bad for both of you!

At least this WASN’T a prank. Some Jack off played a prank on his friend by dying the water red and pretending he’d killed himself.

He let it go as far as his friend calling 911 sobbing.

Naturally his friend beat the ever loving shit out of him.

He got it all on tape. People thought it was funny. Me not at all until the kid beat the shit out of his friend ."
136,that should have been my response.... instead I went silent
137,"Wow, I would pay money to see a meeting like this go down. Who does this? So cringey.

I applaud you for doing what you did. Still laughing, 2 thumbs up!"
138,Damn. I don't normally comment on the TIFUs. I just chuckle and move on. This one was intense. I'm glad you're okay and I'm glad your wife is okay but holy crap dude. Your poor wife.
139,i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself i wasnt going to make apology videos after last years thing so im just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible.
140,Stay off my browser history.
141,Maybe he wants to be pegged. Maybe he wants you to fuck his butt. 
142,exactly what I was thinking... apparently no one else felt this way
143,"I think that was the moment I heard movement in the room and thought that I was finally hallucinating, the excitement was big lol"
144,Restoration 100
145,*Not intended for men with vasectomies.
146,You look so happy in the picture. Adorable lolol
147,It feels like someone came up with a bunch of sex euphemisms and tried to fit as many as they could into a story
148,Yeah his brother fucked his wife and made his son and lied about it presumably for at least 16 years. Not sure that I could ever forgive either of them. The kid you raised is your son so you make it work with him but wife and brother are out 
149,That lunch line holy shit. He’s smooth as fuck
150,"TIL ULPT: If you suspect someone may be dead and this pleases you, always pretend to be sad for a few minutes to ensure it has stuck."
151,The hp logo looks like dy upside down
152,"As soon as he opened the envelope, the sound of clapping emanated from it, inexplicably."
153,I just bought a sports bra that has a front zipper (never owned one like that before) and was so curious what the point of the inner hook was so I haven't been using it. I  just realized that I was putting my breasts and the world in the mercy of a flimsy zipper. Oh geez... definitely gonna be using that extra hook from now on.
154,\#2 behind Chris. 
155,wouldn't be the weirdest one 
156,"""Assuming Direct Control"""
157,Oh God your comment scared me for a second before I realized your joke. lol
158,"Am I have similar consumption ( probably for about 5 years now) half a bottle of whiskey a day, I drink plenty of water and can go multiple days without physical side effects. I however hate my relationship of 7 years and just as things get good and I taper off shit goes off and I drink to not loose my sanity. 

She literally cares so little that she doesn’t even notice when I’m shit faced. And that just makes it worse for me. 

I swear every time I get sober I realize how bad shit is and it’s right back to numbing myself because leaving means leaving all of my dogs.

"
159,"Reddit has always been centred around double D's, and always will."
160,Because I was to annoyed at the time to return them at they time until I just forgot about them. I rediscovered them yesterday.
161,Oh I would have mounted this guy in a heartbeat
162,"Nah, she probably thought she was going to take that secret to the grave. She deserved to have it come out though"
163,"So basically every post on /r/TIFU 

"
164,"as soon as you said you ordered them from wish, i was expecting you actually got glue strips instead of wax. "
165,*These are the boobs you're looking for*
166,"I wax myself and there’s two reasons i can think of why this happened. Either the wax strips were shitty or your hair was too long. Hair that’s too long of thick needs to be trimmed before waxing. Since it’s too late lol, use coconut oil, baby oil or olive oil (whichever you have really) since you can still feel sticky after a shower. "
167,"This should be on every box of Wheaties. The 3.5 step program to a more honest you. Perfectly said, simple and effective. "

169,"hell, just warm water would make that scab pretty useless."
170,He probably convinced himself she actual didn't mean it the way he heard it and he cant tell if she likes him.
171,And the other half just fapping.
172,"My mother in law would have cheered me on, and that's not a good thing, its disturbing.

&amp;#x200B;

A few examples..... After having been married for about 5 years still without children (intentionally) she told me, ""You need to start shooting a couple live rounds up in there, I need a grand baby"".

&amp;#x200B;

It was only a couple of months ago, my wife had a pair of cut-off jean shorts sitting on a chair.  My mother in law picked them up and said to my wife, ""you think these could get any shorter"".  I chimed in sarcastically, I keep cutting a 1/4"" off of them every chance I get"".  My mother in law then brought them over to me and laid them out on the table.  She then took her finger and drew it around the crotch of the shorts and said, ""That's what you should be cutting out"" and give an elbow and a double eyebrow nod."
173,"Wax doesn't come off with water, you're just gonna get lots of pain from this. Oil works wonders though :) time to oil your butt !"
174,"So long as you're moderately attractive, you can't really fuck up by telling a guy that you're into him.  "
175,"When I was about 30, I had to have a testicular ultrasound. The tech who came in was a really attractive woman about my age, and I remember worrying that I'd get aroused (or, somehow worse, shrivel up). She said she was training in a new tech and asked me if I'd mind there being another person. I figured it wasn't like it could get more awkward and said sure, and she came back in with a simply stunning girl in her early 20s. 

As uncomfortable as it was at first, it went okay. When I get uncomfortable, I get silly. She told the trainee, ""The first thing we do is set the machine for small parts,"" and I said ""Hey! Some of us are sensitive! Couldn't you say 'delicate' instead of 'small'? Diminutive? Precious? Compact?"" They giggled and the atmosphere in the room got a lot lighter. She made some little jokes along the way, which I appreciated, and I didn't feel mortified when I left.

I would have been a lot happier if she had used the word ""impressive"" though."
176,*when id doubt rub one out*
177,"At the very least they should've prefaced the discussion with a very stern ""This is not an April fools prank."""
178,This is the one that made me cringe. *Cheating wife chuckles* the fuck are you doing here Linda?  Admiring the the pile of shit you made?

180,"Now change all the names on phone to be funny, that should take the ethics edge off. 

""Siri, call Dad""

"" Calling Dad, my mother fucker"""
181,So glad I watched Guardians of the Galaxy II or that would sound much much weirder.
182,I'm still not sure which
183,"Same. My dad told me he hated having me in his home. 
My step dad treated me like his own from the moment he married my mum.

Love is so much more than DNA "
184,"Right? I hate Jonny with a passion, whomever the douche is. I felt like I had to check up on her too, I can't live knowing that a baby is in potential danger 😅"
185,Congratulations on both the cute boyfriend and your unbreached butthole. 
186,"Don't tell her. If she figures it out, we stop existing."
187,It's not a story your mother would tell you.
188,"Even if the Uncle David didn't know the child was his, he still fucked his own brother's wife! He's a scumbag."
189,"Yeah, it’s like:

My teen brain: BOOBIES!!!

My Adult brain: Oh, how awful. The poor woman must be so embarrassed. 

FTFY."
190,"&gt;Don't wear string bikinis

I.....disagree."
191,"“911 can I have your name and address please?”


“I ... I don’t know. I’m in the shower with my thigh glued to the floor, but I verified that I got my ass unglued just before I slipped and lodged the cucumber fully into my rectum. I’m disoriented and sore, just send help!” ::light sobbing heard with water still running ::


“Okay, stay calm. I just need to verify that this is Dave again and the percentage of insertion involved.”


::sobbing intensifying:: “Yeah, it’s Dave and the cucumber is gone. Please hurry.”"
192,"Absolutely nothing from what I saw. Oh, you meant medically? I can't discuss that. "
193,I'd like to think this actually happened lmao
194,"So your police are willing to stake-out a local mall for weeks just to maybe enforce a restraining-order, able to rapidly comprehend an error on their part *AND* start apologizing for said error rather than spin it on you *AND* send you a ‘sorry bout that’ check in the mail unprompted?

I gotta get my ass to wherever you live, if the cops are that nice imagine how amazing everything else must be."
195,"So, I assume you write over the top erotica?"
196,"that's because you comprehended what you read.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
197,"I have some old people advice for you, if you want.  Here it is:

This may be impossible to imagine right now, but this may end up being the best thing that ever happened to your family, if only because truth has a way of coming out anyway.  Finding it out like you did and ripping the lid off of it prevented anyone from being able to lie their way out of it, which as hard as it may be to imagine right now is everyone's best hope of coming out of this with their relationships and marriages intact, if that's even possible.  

Including you: it's much harder to take this kind of news at 50 than it is at 19, so you've done yourself a favor as well by getting it over with early.  Because of you, your kids don't have to live the lie that you did, and you can be done with this drama in your youth.  I know it all seems crazy right now, but you WILL find the new normal, and it will be okay in the end.  There IS peace for you in this, though you still have some storms to weather first.  

DO NOT let anyone put this on you.  Not now, not ever.  Including yourself, which may be hardest of all.  The fact of the matter is that if you hadn't gotten the DNA test, someone else in your family might have, even your own children in the future, and ripped open the same can of worms.  This situation was not of your making, and you owning it only prevents wounds from healing.  

Truth is the best disinfectant, and is the only hope of saving these relationships (IF they can be saved at all) so don't you dare let anyone put this on you.  And if they do, correct them in a way they won't easily forget, because blaming you and/or the DNA test is not just a lie, it's outright cruel and evil.  Responsibility belongs where it belongs, and it may be up to you to remind others of this in the future.  Don't hesitate to do so.  By insisting on truth, you will be doing the entire family a service, and bringing the quickest possible end to the drama.  Lies only stretch out the agony, and it doesn't matter whose lies they are, so don't own it.  Any of it.

If you can, in time consider forgiving your mom and bio-dad.  Shit happens.  It just does.  And you don't forgive people because they -deserve- forgiveness, nobody does.  You forgive when and where you can just because humans make mistakes, you do too, and it's the best way to save relationships.  Shit happens, for all you know it was a drunken one-nighter they've both felt shitty about ever since, and what's happening right now is more than enough punishment, if you think about it.  So when you're good and ready, NOT before, and IF it seems right to you, consider forgiving them.

As others have said and I can only reiterate, your now-step dad is blameless in this and has gotten his entire marriage thrown into chaos overnight.  Be there for him, in any way you can.  Ditto your half-sister cousin.  You won't regret it.

Also, unless you want to hear redneck family tree jokes, be VERY careful who you tell in real life.  I know you need support and people with whom to discuss this, just... be careful.  Let it go on Reddit all you like, it doesn't matter, but in real life you can't put this genie back in the bottle.  If it gets out, it gets out, but try to keep a lid on it until YOU are ready to talk about it, for your own sake.

Finally, I have to tell you as an older person that this thing has only just started.  You have miles to go before this thing winds down, and unseen changes yet to come.  But you're gonna be okay, and so are they: of all the evils in the world, this is one of the lesser ones, and everyone gets to live at the end.  As hard as this may be (and I don't underestimate it at all) try to keep it in perspective, because that helps with sanity over the long run.

I wish you well.  Good luck, kid."

222,"One of the most confusing days of my life was when I had to get an MRI for a persistent low level ache in one of my testicles (which turned out to be torsion).

First tech is a 60 year old Chinese lady who destroys my testicle by jamming the sensor into it and basically grinding down hard enough I'm in agony.  I have to tell her to stop as she didn't really seem to know what she was doing.  She leaves the room and I clean up not knowing what is going to happen next.

After a couple of minutes in comes super hot 20 year old tech who seems very inexperienced as well.  She applies whatever liquid they use to my testicles while inadvertently making eye contact and I instantly have the largest erection of my life while still in pain from the previous tech and the torion i have going on.  

I'm not sure if I was blushing more than her but it was a pretty close race.  

To her credit she professionally finishes the MRI and then leaves the room with a wry smile while I have to lay there for another 10 minutes waiting for things to subside before getting dressed and heading back to the waiting room for the results.

After maybe 20 minutes i head back in to see my very attractive 30 something year old doctor who explains what torsion is and how she can manually deal with it and I'm instantly erect just from hearing her describe what she needed to do.

Awkward manual detorsion then occurs with me not daring to open my eyes."

2.) Last night (now in my thirties) she called me to tell me the following. ""[Friends Name] came to see me at work today. Was talking about [Mutual Friend]'s new girlfriend.

As for your reaction, well, maybe there was an inkling inside of you that the confession was true but your internal clockwork didn't want to accept that truth just yet, so it defaulted to the April Fools option instead?

Not giving his dad a heads up (the person he was seemingly closest with) is a big mistake to me. He went in guns blazing and did the scorched earth method on a mother he doesn’t really care for. Obviously, this family dynamic has more issues then paternity. I think Dad deserved to hear it from son first, then approach mom together.

361,"You merely discovered your mother's fuckup. It could probably be delivered more smoothly, but lies are bad foundations for any relationships and whatever comes from this has a causal link with what your mother and your uncle/father did and you shouldn't blame yourself. In the end you probably did your (original?) father a service by revealing the truth."

369,"Yup. Especially since they are medical professionals, a line like ""wow that's impressive"" by a male doctor to a female patients' breasts or genitalia could cost him his license or at least very severe repercussions. May or may not be a lawsuit but probably will be.

You might think I'm exaggerating but I'm really not."
370,"when my family used epsom salts for our feet, we always just used a large bucket with warm water, never a full bath with the stuff.  with his risk of bleeding, i'm surprised he'd go all in like that.

399,"I feel for you.  When my wife and I were dating I told her over the phone I was going to lay down one evening because I had a horrible headache.  I didn't think I was tired but apparently I went into the deepest sleep I had ever been in my entire life.  Fast forward a few hours, she's trying to call me, I'm not answering the phone, and she starts to worry.  She lived with her sister and BIL at the time.  BIL starts telling her that this is how his mom died.  Took a nap and never woke up (some undiagnosed heart problem).  They both come over to check on me but I don't hear them banging on the door.  She has a key but I dead bolted the door and there was no key for that.  They get the landlord involved but she doesn't have a key, either.  BIL starts to talk about how he bets I'm cheating and too afraid to answer the door.  They are even banging on the wall in the vacant apartment that shares a wall with my bedroom, right behind my bed.  Eventually I wake up, open the front door.  Everyone is standing there.  Future wife is crying.  She's so pissed at me for not answering and I have no idea what is going on.  She was pretty certain I was dead.  I think she overreacted.  FWIW, falling into a deep sleep like that is not me at all."

401,"One time, I was making stir fry with my then girlfriend, and I  added some  ginger to enhance the flavor. I asked her if she wanted to try some fresh ginger, because she had never done that before. She told me, ""only if you try some first"". I like ginger, and have no problem with chowing down on fresh ginger root, so I took a big bite, and thoroughly enjoyed it. She cautiously took a bite, and immediately went red and made little noises, all the while accompanied by my laughter. She ended up marrying me, but she still doesn't like ginger. Good thing I'm not a red head!"

407,"You NEED to go and see a Doctor. The problem isn’t a problem, it’s 3 problems: Your shitty relationship, your drinking, and your depression, and they’re all feeding into each other.

Depression on its own is bad enough but even though it feels like drinking is the only way to keep your head above water, what you don’t realise is that you’re just drowning in something else instead.

I don’t know your girlfriend or wife but I’m sure it’s hell on her as well to see you the way you are all the time. Maybe that feeds some of her bad behaviours, maybe it doesn’t - she could be an absolute angel being terrorised by your drunken abuse, or she could be an absolute devil who subjects *you* to emotional torture and mind games that would turn *any* man insane - I obviously don’t know, but I can guarantee the truth will appear much different to you without the lens of alcoholic depression.

Instead of seeing the problem before the end goal, try looking at the end goal first and working backwards from there. Where do you need to be to be happy? Maybe living on your own with your dogs? Okay, what happens just before that - you find your own apartment, but with what money? Maybe get a different job or find a way to save to move out. How best to do that? Maybe you can stay with one of your parents in the meantime while you get back on your feet. But to do that, you have to get the courage to leave. How? Start on the road to fighting depression. Start taking any medication you may need, and get the coping skills you need so that you won’t feel the need to drink to numb your pain. Do that by seeing a doctor.

Think of it like a video game - you don’t fight the end boss right away, that would be suicide. You start by getting stronger - solve small problems first, and once they’re out of the way, you move on to bigger challenges. They will ALWAYS be challenging, but the point is that you build on what you achieved yesterday to conquer tomorrows problems. You make yourself stronger bit by bit at a time.

I get there will be some major seemingly impossible problems, like maybe the dogs are hers and she won’t give them up, but by that point it won’t seem like an end boss you can’t beat, you’ll be strong enough to find the right solution when you need to. It’s impossible now, sure, but just trust that it will be possible then, one way or the other."

409,"Sorry your wife is traumatized. Hopefully you guys are both on the mend.

Side note: my husband loves baths. He soaks in epsom salt quite a bit since he has various metal rods and screws holding him together which can cause some soreness if he’s been active. We call these “grown ass man baths”"
410,"Nah, I don't know much. Just that men are simple creatures. Way more simple than women assume. We all act more confident than we are. And we all want a short list from our SO:

1) We want someone who laughs at our shitty jokes. 

2) We want someone who touches our pp at least once a week

3) We want someone who understands that needing time for ourselves is not the same as not wanting to spend time with you. 

4) We want someone who helps us forget just how shitty life can be, someone to be there when we get home, hug us and lie that everything will work out. "

423,"A few years ago, my wife had surgery on a couple nerves in her leg. Obviously, slicing up nerves is a painful procedure, so she stayed pretty medicated for the two days or so she was in the hospital and was still well doped up when we got home. We got back from the hospital, got her situated in her favorite recliner, then I went out to fill her prescriptions.

When I got home, I walk in the door, into the room, and see her in the recliner, eyes closed, head lolled to the side, blood running out of her mouth and down her chin and neck. Even in the second and a half it took to rush over to the chair, I'm thinking she must've bit her tongue and choked on the blood and passed out and oh god, it's been 10 years since I was certified in CPR am I going to remember?!?!

I get to her, reach out and she immediately, but groggily starts moving. I start asking what happened, is she OK? She says she's fine, just dozed off, has no idea what I'm going on about. I tell her she's bleeding, there is blood running out of her mouth.

She says ""no I'm not"" and reaches up to her mouth to check - with the bag of Very Cherry Jelly Bellies she had been munching on still in her hand. She hadn't been bleeding, just drooling red-stained saliva. Ten years later and she still thinks it's the funniest damn thing that's ever happened (once I got over the shock, I couldn't help but agree)."

429,"Biggest problem with this argument is that you’re ignoring the casualties of the lie. The father who was cheated on was robbed of the chance to write his own story. If he had known 19 years ago that this kid wasn’t his, he might’ve bailed, met someone else and fallen in love again, had a completely different life than the one he has now. That’s time he’s never getting back. Those possibilities were all robbed from him the moment the mother and uncle decided to cover up their mistake instead of coming clean. "
