0,This story makes me feel like you raped yourself.
1,"\&gt;  steve looks totally chill

&amp;#x200B;

Such a steve move."
2,The first part of this was objectively hilarious. I feel so bad for you and your wife that your mother-in-law was so rough. Hopefully you can get through this with minimal suffering. Having a newborn is hard enough.
3,We now have dinner at their place on Sunday.  Unenthusiastic yay.
4,"This post goes from 0 to 100 to 1000 real quick.  

Keep this burner account active to update us."
5,"That was a wild ride, my man."
6,FU #2:  Too many details in this post.  No way is your wife not reading this :D
7,coot scoot boogie
8,I would love to see photos of you porpoising at the waterfall
9,"Roses are red

You popped a tire

I'm sorry you had sex with a mega obese vampire."
10,The next time he proporses to a girl lol
11,How tf you can managed to get your dick erect all the time?
12,This made me feel better about my recent decisions. Even the bad ones. Thanks
13,"Wife: ""Hi, my name is Shirly and this is...""

You: ""No need for introductions, ma'am. Steve and I go way back. How's your ass feelin', buddy?"""
14,"Going back to work has been tough knowing I can't help.  This compliment made me feel really good.

Thank you for that."
15,"People don‚Äôt believe me sometimes when I say no sex is better than bad sex.  Learn from OP, and believe me when I say that it‚Äôs never too late to turn back. It‚Äôs way easier to live with the feeling that comes with embarrassing someone than it is to live with the memory of that time your standards were even lower than your self respect."
16,It was a lot worse actually living it
17,"Next time this happens, immediately put your phone in airplane mode to stop the image send."
18,You're a keeper.
19,I wana say this is BS.... but your name makes me think otherwise.
20,"&gt;""I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole""

F"
21,"I've only told this to two other people and one of them did say they think I was raped. I'm really not sure, I did bring it upon myself."
22,"What really gets me about this story is, what kind of girl TELLS her sister about her wild sexual encounter, knowing full well it was with her sister's husband? That's some sadistic shit. And it kinda seems like unlikely that they BOTH just forgot it was each other. Seems fishy."
23,"Love it, I have a feeling it wouldn't fly with the mother with the mother in law either lol.  On a positive note, my wife woke up and asked me to get the baby for its titty juice.  so I guess it's still on the menu.

Maybe just not on the labels for awhile."
24,fucking steve... literally
25,"Anyone who wakes a new mom deserves to be decked, MIL or not."
26,"We call it booby juice. And we just put the date, the bottles and bags are pretty distinctive"
27,And then from 1000 to 10000 with the first edit
28,"&gt; EDIT: YALL IM A GUY. sorry, i didn‚Äôt clarify that in the original.

THIS was the biggest plot twist"
29,"This is really cool. I‚Äôm a zoologist/biologist and have worked extensively with ravens, crows, and other types of intelligent birds. Ravens actually are deemed scientifically the most intelligent birds. They‚Äôre able to solve puzzles, recognized love, recognize themselves in a mirror, and in reported cases start cars, leave gifts, and even develop grudges. 

Thanks for brightening my day, gave me a good laugh. I needed this."
30,"Nut Madness is a rarely discussed, but insidious syndrome."
31,You weren't raped - you just defiled yourself. You used a couple of holes and got shit for it in return... both literally and figuratively
32,"NO, don't fuck her cat too!"
33,He was just being polite. Giving her shit back to her.
34,Yeah don't see this situation coming up again XD
35,cats already out of the bag so fuck it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
36,Shocked that 42 other people had sex with landlord... buys rental properties.
37,Holy fuck I wish I had gold to give. This killed me.
38,No problem :)
39,"Or dolphining would be fine, too."
40,Neither did she.
41,"&gt;They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged.

What a gentleman üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 

This post is beyond disturbing but I couldn't stop reading."
42,"OP: *looks down, sees body covered in feces*
OP: ah, shit... here we go again
OP: *gets back in the bath*"
43,"Im more curious about OPs username, landlordfucker43. There has been 42 landlord fuckers on here in the past......."
44,"Did you at least cum a lot, like a power move?"
45,I think the part where you really fucked up was when you tried to convince her it was a coincidence. That's just insulting her intelligence and losing trust
46,"I can tell you it‚Äôs not even about the fact that you slept with her sister, but the fact that you both kept it from her."
47,"Even better would be: 
OP: ""Hi, my name is..."" 
Landlords wife: ""No need for introductions, Bill. Steve and I are open with each other. How's your ass feelin', buddy?"""
48,Like a firehose.
49,What. The fuck. Did I just. Read.
50,"You did so much good today that you‚Äôre not giving yourself credit for. You let your wife vent, you gave her a break, and you even brought surprises home. You were her best friend and as a mom I can tell you that‚Äôs what she needed most. Good job, dad."
51,I'm gay now.
52,"There were 42 other landlordfuckers before he made the account, seems pretty common."
53,"Not rape but I will say that reckless behavior and unsafe sex are considered forms of self-harm. It sounds like you need some help, and I say that in the most loving way possible. Not caring what happens to you is not normal and you deserve better. A therapist is a really good starting place."
54,same thing with him forgetting about how the chick he banged in the barn was his wifes sister.
55,"&gt;So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my **at the time girlfriend** (24F).



Not gonna lie. My heart kinda dropped at this part. Thought it would end badly. SO GLAD it worked out!!"
56,"Given how chill he was, do you have any corroborating evidence that you haven't met a pair of identical twins?

It's an outrider, but still..."
57,"Dude that edit made this much much crazier! I read through the thing and was like eh, big coincidence that dude ends up being your married land lord. 

&gt; I‚Äôm a guy 

**Oh Shit!** nevermind this is nuts lol"
58,"Also I just caught the typo in my post you were referring to, I'll just leave it lol"
59,"I've stopped sex dead on its tracks, like naked-in-bed-type of momentum. No regrets. Its the right thing to do for yourself."
60,"upvote for the jokes, asian mom (now granny, hence the baby) just can't take some joke.

I am asian too :)

cheers mate, it'll pass.. the sleepless nights"
61,it‚Äôs a stretch since he had the same name on tinder. (which is weird if you‚Äôre cheating but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
62,Looks like someone won't be feeling the love tonight.
63,"EDIT: YALL IM A GUY. sorry, i didn‚Äôt clarify that in the original.  


  


  
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAAH - it's the best and mature answer to this.A"
64,"Indeed, how blooming rude and selfish over a label. the MiL is atrocious."
65,"*OP shatters phone*

Zoologist: This is really cool!"
66,Pre-nut obscurity
67,Maybe the wife is cool with it and was boning her own tenant in another room Saturday night
68,"Rides typically have ups, downs, and twists. This was an emotional roller coaster that only went down. An emotional slide if you will."
69,Thanks to this post I'm deleting tinder and probably my penis as well
70,"Your TIFU is ruining my day bro. You fuck up and we all suffer by reading that. 

Next time you think it's a good idea to stick your dick in a hole that stinks so bad it's making you tear up, leave the situation immediately lol."
71,"Stop calling the sister, makes you look like you are trying to conspire with her. Just leave her out of it.

Your concern is your wife. Time to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Let your wife know that you recognized the sister at the dinner and the two of you decided to just never talk about it again. And that is where you messed up. You should have told her and you are sorry. Then let her feel how she feels. You can't control that.

If I was your wife I would be hurt that not only had you had sex with my sister but that the both of you think of each other when thinking of wild sex. That would be the thought rolling through my mind, is that you still think of the wild sex you had with my sister that you hid from me.

I have been cheated on before (and I know you didn't cheat), and the thing that hurt most what that others knew something I didn't and I felt so stupid. I am sure that is how she feels.

Now is time to pull out all the stops and have the greatest heart to heart you can. Not sure if you can recover from this. Good luck."
72,I hope you locked eyes with her sister. Assuring dominance
73,‚ÄòYou just defiled yourself.‚Äô ... I think this sums it up.
74,Shrek
75,Nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m.
76,Or one eye on each. Double-sun power
77,I thought this story was going to be about walking in on your wive‚Äôs sister and cousin. My reading comprehension skills suck.
78,Should've checked yourself before you... Shreked yourself.
79,"üé∂üé∂  Get down, slide around, on the ground, coot scoot booooooogie üé∂üé∂"
80,"Ngl, I saw that before I posted this and considered changing it, but figured it would make for a more thrilling read lol. And yes I'm aware that makes me TA haha"
81,I'm depressed for you.
82,god im a dude and i want to marry you now
83,"&gt; left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back

Wait. I'm sorry. Did you say she disturbed the precious sleep of a woman who has recently given birth to and is caring for a newborn, *to give her a lecture about being a potty mouth*?!?!

Good fucking riddance, then. If anyone had ever woken me from a nap during the newborn phase for anything but ""the baby needs to eat"" or ""the house is on fire"", I would have never spoken to them again. 

Your MIL sucks and you're a good partner for cutting your wife slack for passing the venom on to you. 

But seriously though, if MIL never comes back, that sounds like a problem that solves itself."
84,I read it over twice and still Can't picture it.
85,"I dont think the owner of the shampoo just deposited his seed for an unknown reason. He very likely noticed that all of his things were being stolen by his (sorry OP) terrible roommate and this is his way of revenge. 

Kind of like when someone rubs someone elses toothbrush in their butt crack to get back at someone (lived in apartment style dorms, seen it happen). 

Tough break if that wasnt the first time he had done this anticipating it would get used by someone else."
86,worst/best thing I‚Äôve read in a while lmao
87,this has nothing to do with Lion King lol
88,Thank you
89,"Ya, now I don't feel bad about being a virgin."
90,"Did Steve tell you that perchance?

&amp;#x200B;

Steve."
91,"Literally not computing in my head how and why you decided to continue after seeing and smelling something you weren‚Äôt into. That‚Äôs the whole point of consensual sex, you can stop at any time. Seems like a long way to go not to hurt their feelings by doing a 180 as soon as you saw the woman."
92,"If this is true, say hello to a year‚Äôs worth of free rent."
93,That is... impressive.  Not gonna lie...
94,"Yeah, it's deeply stupid if you're practicing infidelity to use your real name: That sadly doesn't discount the possibility.

How's the housing market where you are? Another outlying possibility is that their marriage is over - coming out as homosexual to his hetero wife would be reasonable grounds for separation - and that they've agreed to share the proceeds of the lease in the interim whilst waiting for the market to improve.

I'm working really hard to think the best here..."
95,It was the implication
96,I'm a landlord... and I find this disgusting. Where do you find these types of tenants? What site did you see them on? This is disgusting. Just tell me what site to find them on already...
97,"Not as bad as your landlord will feel when he loses half his shit in a divorce.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
98,"Yep, Im the same. Haven't had sex for quite some time, despite offers. Gotta be true to yourself, and not lose yourself to the dick madness... jerk off, then see if you still want that person, is my advice."
99,"And we do the freshly squeezed versus cold booby juice too. The freshly squeezed one is ""the good stuff""."
100,"Its only been 3 weeks, sleep seems like such a distant memory already."
101,Plot twist: Steve looked totally chill because he‚Äôs openly bi and has an open relationship with his wife so he can get some D on the side
102,F
103,Looks like everyone got fucked that day.
104,Followed by the even worse post-nut guilt.
105,"Even better...OP: ""Hi, my name is..."" Landlords wife: ""Just take off your pants its my turn now."""
106,You had it cumming
107,"""I've been doing this for three weeks now. Someone send help."""
108,"Fine!

You uh, mind passing me that bag?"
109,"This post has a lot of layers to it, like an onion."
110,"A firefighter's pole of despair, if you will."
111,That seemed totally plausible to me...
112,"Why is this a FU? You were successful, OP!"
113,OP knows some people that can change that for ya.
114,"i couldn‚Äôt do that, i feel terrible enough already"
115,"Yeah, post-nut clarity has kept me from making some really bad decisions."
116,"""I fucking saw you feeding a robin today you cheating asshole""

..

I mean **caw**"""
117,I like small boobs now
118,Get ready for next years TIFU by accidentally extorting my landlord.
119,I'll post them when I get home from work! Pics are on my phone which I don't have on me during the day lol
120,"Okay funny story, I mentioned your comment and she replied ""Girl or guy?  You know what, doesn't matter, we could use the help."""
121,Momma always told me don‚Äôt take no shit.
122,I feel like the last thing he would want is Shamu's shit inside his reverse-penis. I feel like that's all that kept this poor guy going.
123,My man didn‚Äôt get chance to set the story straight face to face so he‚Äôs doing what we like to call a ‚Äúpro gamer move‚Äù and posting it to reddit which he knows to read and is merely pretending that he hopes she doesn‚Äôt read it.
124,How else do you expect to get an apartment in this town?
125,"You're awesome. 

Also, not going to lie, when I read that grandma doesn't know if she can come back to the house I thought ""hopefully she won't for awhile"". 

Never wake a new, sleeping mother or baby, come on, lady! (Obvious urgencies aside, of course)."
126,I honestly can't believe you told that story to that tow truck driver and your friends. I would have taken that shit with me *to the grave*
127,Excuse me
128,With a chunk of shit on the head of the dick...i dont think I'll have a dick anymore.
129,How do I unread something
130,Oh god hahahhaha
131,"Many newly grandmas are like this. I don't know what it is, jealousy over the attention of the new mother, jealousy that they can't have a baby anymore but it isn't rare behavior."
132,"I just want to say this is a great TIFU post, it‚Äôs really well written (check that formatting) and isn‚Äôt offensive to anyone, with the exception of your MIL. Good job OP"
133,This.  My God.  This.
134,"You know now that you can always leave a situation when/if you feel uncomfortable or change your mind. I‚Äôd recommend actually seeing someone about this event, I know it sounds patronising but I don‚Äôt mean it that way. I‚Äôm sure it was somewhat cathartic just to write it all out so hopefully you can speak to a professional about it, understand better why you did this and then hopefully put it in the past. Time will make this memory less painful and less frequent, trust me.

If you need someone to vent to I‚Äôm here and a good listener. üíó"
135,lock a door?
136,r/suicidebywords
137,Your mother in law sucks. To bail on her daughter over that is brutal. Im currently going through something similar except my wife‚Äôs mother never came over in the first place.
138,"&gt; To bail on her daughter over that is brutal

It just shows that her mother's love and support is conditional. That's a pretty shitty thing to have too discover about your parent."
139,"Your first fuck up was not saying anything from the get go, the second was telling your wife about the wildest encounter you had which was with her sister (I don't believe you actually forgot that tiny detail), the fourth was not coming clean immediately and apologizing for all the little lies you had to have told over the years to cover it up, the fifth was lying *again* and trying to cover it up *again*, and the sixth was posting it here for your wife, *who you admit uses Reddit*, to read. 

You fucking numpty."
140,Your mother in law is an uptight bitch
141,You‚Äôre welcome hahah! That‚Äôs sick. Can they be pets?
142,"|  **Oh Shit!** nevermind this is nuts lol 

I mean probably..."
143,Man I cant even get hard for attractive girls sometimes
144,"Dude, whatever your beliefs are in life, the universe or something always sends signs. 1 hour drive, popped tires, basement, flash light. 

For example, let's say you believe that the sun is our holy power. The Sun was like 'how many effin tyres I gotta pop to make this guy turn back!?' 

Enjoy your summer bro, it's all uphill from here"
145,Sweater Kitten Soda?
146,"You didn't ruin it - you observed it with your eyes and it's  now in your memory forever (and ours too because we imagined it from your words). All you did was not video it and startled the ravens. The ravens will be back, doing this again because it worked. Corvids are smart, they will repeat something that gave them a benefit."
147,Gollum wasn‚Äôt letting him leave without getting his precious
148,"Should have slapped you wife on the arse, pointed at her sister with eye contact ‚Äúyou‚Äôre next.‚Äù"
149,"I once had a female friend say something I will never forget and fits in here.  ""You can't rape the willing.""

&amp;#x200B;

It sucks that it happened but something in your head just kept you going on.  I drove a ways once and ended up getting married to the girl later on.  It was more a marriage of convenience in a lot of ways.  We were both lonely and later on when she was hurt at work I stuck around quite a while out of obligation.  Eventually she started enjoying the pain meds way too much and decided she didn't want to be around which was fine by me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I met my second wife and was much happier, she passed away a couple months ago and for the first time in a long while I am alone.   I can only hope that some day I will find someone to be with again."
150,stopping is dying
151,"Wow bro. You‚Äôre fucked. Not because you banged her sister but because you‚Äôve lost her trust. The moment you both agreed to never speak of that situation you both consciously made a decision to lie to a person you both love. 

Idk if I‚Äôd come back from that one."
152,"Well the tow truck driver I knew I was never going to meet again, and he seemed like the type of wild dude that loves that kind of stuff, and he was laughing pretty hard. My IRL friends don't know, the only other people I did tell were more internet friends."
153,OP was trying to convince his wife that it was just a coincidence that him and her sister had the exact same sex story.
154,"I honestly never thought that he‚Äôd be doing it on purpose, but now that people bring that up I‚Äôm almost 100% sure that‚Äôs the case and I totally brought this on myself"
155,"As a woman, I agree"
156,"Fuck typical asian parenting culture. Often just spoonfeeding and scolding, not given chance to properly take responsibility, but when needed and fail, more scolding. Also more scolding when you get into an argue, regardless you're right or wrong, no reasoning given. ""I'm older than you therefore I know more than you"".

&amp;#x200B;

Sauce: am asian living in asia"
157,"&gt;My wife‚Äôs family has a tendency to enter without knocking.  
...  
&gt;  
&gt; We didn't expect them to enter"
158,"Yup, me too."
159,TIFU by committing a felony because of advice from Reddit!
160,Damn bro. That one hit
161,"This wouldn't result in guilt. Guilt is when you Jerk off in your church bathroom during the sermon. This would be post-nut shame. Shame is much, much, worse."
162,"I'm imagining gollum licking his cracked lips and drooling as you go to pound town on what may very-well be the living personification of atomic gonorrhea, before in a moment of pure ecstasy, he orgasmically moans:

163,Standard porn theme.
164,Initial FU with a miraculous save I suppose haha. Still get teased about it though lol
165,"Emphasis on plot, OP has ascertained a position where he's more powerful than the landlord."
166,Exactly what I was thinking. Could this be an elaborate stunt by Disney to market Lion King? üßê
167,I am honoured to witness the beginnings this thread
168, Apparently she had decided her need for show boating and drama was more important than helping her daughter and spending time with her grandchild.
169,"We didn't expect them to enter and thought we we would be in-and-out in a minute, basically."
170,"Classic attempt to seem genuine online so the wife can see his side of the story. Smart move, I‚Äôd do the same. Hope it works out because it‚Äôs an innocent coincidence. Although the ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù to keep his wife out of the know is probably what she‚Äôs most upset about."
171,I feel like reality when out of its way to damage his car to prevent him from making this mistake and he just kept fucking goin like dumb ass.
172,that escalated quickly
173,I just finished watching the latest season and I do not recall seeing that plot point.
174,"I‚Äôm going to be straight with you. It gets worse for the next 5 weeks or so. But then it starts to get better. It all starts to work and come together most of the time. Some of that is because you start to figure stuff out, some of it is because baby settles down, and some of it is because you just get used to operating on no sleep.

Good luck. One day you‚Äôll forget how hard it is and think about having another child."
175,"He's got some short shorts and a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG

SCROTUM."
176,"She hasn't been the easiest lady to along with, all older ladies in her family are kind of like that.  Dad super chill though, good dude have a beer with and quietly discuss the mother in law."
177,It really bugs me that your username is missing an underscore.
178,"OP: HI, my name is

Wife: What?

OP: My name is

Steve: Who?

OP: My name is \*shika shika\* Slim Shady"
179,"Man before it arrived we had a lot of conversation on how long we wanted to wait until the next one.  A week after we were like, ya know how about we just take that second baby idea, stick a pin on it and put it in the parking lot."
180,It‚Äôs the number of landlords he has fucked
181,"America... where we can assign books about school shootings... then get upset that people think about the book... but don‚Äôt actually do anything of note to address the fucking unending stream of school shootings.

Makes sense guys.

That‚Äôs a rough go kid. First rule of talking to police officers is you don‚Äôt before you talk to a lawyer. When they pick you up they don‚Äôt see you as innocent. They see you as guilty and are trying to nail you, and even innocent people can say things that may ‚Äúincriminate‚Äù them under duress or panic.

Anything you say can AND will be used against you in the court of law. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre innocent or not."
182,"Using dolphines as a jet ski? I heard they can rape humans, so that wouldn't be a great idea!"
183,"Sounds like your mother in law needs to invest in a sense of humour.

It's a shame, it would be nice to say ""fuck her, makes you and your wife laugh, who cares what she thinks"", but I appreciate it's not that easy.

Still... Fuck her. She needs to lighten up."
184,that‚Äôs always an option!
185,"I, too , get sweaty within a couple holes. 

But I‚Äôve never played golf"
186,"I will, we've had our differences of opinions in that past and usually come to some sort relative agreement (pun intended) in one on one conversation.  Usually pretty good at picking which hill to dieon on but today wasn't the day.  My my didn't need the extra stress.

I'll find some time on Sunday to discuss it."
187,"Well, she's Asian. For us, we should be grateful they gave birth to us. Even though we didn't ask to be born and they were the one who wants children"
188,"Agreed! Not to mention it‚Äôs his damn house, if he wants to label that titty milk, titty milk it‚Äôs his right"
189,And I bet that tenant is a female
190,"&gt; I once had a female friend say something I will never forget and fits in here. ""You can't rape the willing.""

I feel like this was meant to sound profound, but it is just an accurate description of how rape works."
191,Tit-tea
192,"Thanks, comments like this actually make me feel like I'm not too far gone."
193,"Try ""Nipple Nectar"""
194,"Idk about it being plausible. I think if you never saw the girl again and someone asked who was it or wanted some in depth questions about the individual you might not remember. 

But if you lock eyes with a person you previously fucked and realize both you of know one an another from fucking, AND that encounter happens to be your most memorable fucking moment, AAAANNNNDDD that person now turns out to be your current wife‚Äôs sister, odds are you didn‚Äôt forget... 

That‚Äôs just my two cents. If you asked me right now to name a specific sexual encounter, I may not be able to, but once you add all those other details I‚Äôm pretty sure it would jog a memory.. 

I mean just telling the story to your boys should have the person engraved in your mind somewhat. (Not saying I do this, but I heard this is a common guy thing..)

Anyways, that‚Äôs just my two cents. Great story nonetheless OP."
195,"I truly laughed out loud, and I almost never do that. Thanks."
196,"me first

200,You have some now haha
201,Shrek
202,"Are you going to discuss the issue at all with your mother-in-law in private? Everything you said about having something to lighten the mood when you both are caring for a newborn is completely valid, even if it was just a dumb inside joke between the two of you. It'd be terrible if your MIL decided not to help out your wife, her daughter, over something as small and trivial as that. You shouldn't have to apologize but I imagine mending the issue as soon as possible would be best for everyone."
203,Sounds like you weren't the only one to make a poorly-timed entrance.
204,Found the guy who's never had anal sex
205,The both of you have a weird fucking relationship. I'll give you that.

245,Yeah if any MIL did this to my wife I would have picked up the phone and told her that if she ever behaved that way again she would no longer be welcome in my home. No name calling or yelling required. Just setting very reasonable boundaries.

Then the toilet sucked all the liquids out of the toilet and i didn't expect it so it scared me. Then I pushed the door open and there was the little boy. The door hit him right on the forehead. Luckely he was a tough one and didn't cry or something. And the father saw it happen so I could explain if he wanted to, but he didnt. Thats when i walked away fast and got back into my seat. Never again an airplane toilet for me"

299,"Regardless on if this is rape or not, it sounds like just a... Kind of traumatizing time overall. Especially since how bizarre and intimidating it sounds by your description, and just how it sounds less like you wanted to and more that you really just wanted to punish yourself with disgusting, terrible sex because brain chemistry goes in some fucked places. 

Have you spoken to a therapist since then? It couldn't possibly hurt worse than this entire incident."

317,"My aunt has a glass eye. When someone asked her to keep an eye on something, she would literally pop it out and put it on the thing."
318,"They do. There was once a woman in my city named ‚ÄúMrs. Hurlbut‚Äù who was the de-facto bird lady. She was in her 80s, and had a small business where she would take care of sick birds. She even had a bird ambulance. Like a super-old ambulance, like the one from Ghostbusters. My mother owned 6 parakeets who contracted a cold virus plague. She desperately sought out help, and somehow, found out about Mrs. Hurlbut.

We show up at Mrs. Hurlbut‚Äôs place, and walk into this large, possibly 19th-century home of hers. Immediately, we noticed that this was not a home for humans. Bird crap everywhere in the hole-filled carpet, and her living room was largely taken-up by a giant bird cage. In this cage was Edgar.

Edgar was a Raven. He had pots and pans and all sorts of toys hanging from the sides of his cage to play with and bang on. She said that he needed a lot of things like that, otherwise he got very ‚Äúornery.‚Äù She said he was not always confined to the cage, but sometimes had free reign.

Edgar was ornery anyway. She had taught him to say ‚ÄúNevermore‚Äù at one point, but he had dropped the ‚Äúmore‚Äù part somewhere along the years. She would get up out of her chair waving her finger and say ‚ÄúEdgar!! We have company! You be good Edgar!!!‚Äù He would reply ‚ÄúNever!!! Never!!!‚Äù It was hilarious. I had never seen shit like this in my life. Edgar would then proceed to peck at the pots and pans and make as much noise as he could in protest of ‚Äúbeing good.‚Äù

She explained that Ravens are very intelligent and have a lot of needs. Without a lot of things to play with and things to do, they get angry. She pointed out a book on her shelf that she had written about Edgar and herself. I think it was called ‚ÄúEdgar and I.‚Äù

In the other rooms of the house were numerous cages of birds that she was taking care of. Only the raven seemed to need such a large area and so many toys. These birds had clearly taken precedence over her house; the whole place was in a terrible state of disrepair. Edgar was the only one who got the full special experience and freedom, though.

Mrs. Hurlbut died not long after that, as did most of my mom‚Äôs parakeets. The only one that survived the cold was the bitchiest one of all of them: an albino parakeet that didn‚Äôt get along with the others named ‚ÄúAngel.‚Äù Angel lived a full life for a parakeet, that little ornery bird. We figure she survived so long because she didn‚Äôt socialize with the rest.

I will always remember that crazy experience meeting Edgar and Mrs. Hurlbut. They were both full of piss and vinegar."

337,"There‚Äôs 6 years between our 2. That‚Äôs partly due to waiting until #1 was less difficult (he‚Äôs an utterly delightful teen now). #2 was easier in lots of ways but he was (and still is) a terrible sleeper. He was awake at least twice a night until he was 2, and he didn‚Äôt sleep through until he was 4. I‚Äôd have murdered someone if I wasn‚Äôt so damn tired (probably one of those parents whose kid slept through from 6 weeks old). You find your way through, though. 

The best advice I can give is keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs incredibly hard to be the guy that works all day then takes baby from mom to give her a break when you get home all the time, but it makes you a goddamn hero."
338,"I bet most people who've tried to just not bring it up though. I think it's fair to try and not bring this up, because what, even if he had come clean at the earliest possible time, it might've ended his relationship then.

It's not like he cheated, and I think generally a lot of couples don't talk about specific details of who and how they've fucked.

Assuming OP is telling the truth, I'm with OP 100%, I don't think he did anything wrong.  I understand why his wife is upset, but hopefully she understands that he never did anything shady to her."
339,"If your story happened, then this comment up here is the big truth. Been here before also.  ""Being successful"" in this situation looks like this comment above mine. You have an opportunity to ask ""What kind of person would I want to be in this situation?"" Too often we think ""Whats the easiest way out of this situation?"" The heart to heart is terrifying but it can lead to great growth and closeness after some time passes. If it goes bad, then you did the best you could without regrets and learned a lesson; this happens to all of us."

Here are some things I know about you. You're a great writer. That leads me to believe you're also very intelligent. You're willing to reflect thoughtfully on your own actions. Many people don't bother to do that. You're interested in bettering yourself, which is admirable.

But, not all of my family is like my dad, and none of my Asian friends have parents like my dad. Some of the stereotypes couldn't be any closer to the truth.

My dad never told me that I wasn't worth anything because my GPA was subpar. My dad never pushed me to become a doctor, go to a UC, or drive a BMW or Mercedes. All my Asian friends though...

Stuff like this is par for the course for a traditional Asian parent."

400,"There's not really anything suspicious or unlikely about not remembering exact details from a drunken wham bam encounter years ago.

Especially if these folks are in their 30's. I dated a girl for 2 years in my 20's. I wouldn't remember or recognize her if she sat on my head.

It's like you remember field trips you took in school but you don't remember everybody that went with you. The ones you do remember and still know you don't think about that field trip when you see them.

It's entirely plausible that he didn't make a connection. He almost definitely thought he was well clear of the wife finding out about the sister hookup years ago.

Why do the rest of us have to watch out for these people's spawn? Grr."
404,"Oh hey, I remember in track practice one of our upper classman hurdlers fucked up and landed ass crack on the hurdle and just sat there in pain until help arrived. Maybe he sat on his balls too, idk. 

Now normally these things just tip over if you mess up. They're designed to do so, so I'm really not even sure how he managed it. The coach and assistant coach had to help him waddle to the trainers office so he could get checked out and later campus security drove over in a golf cart to take him somewhere. 

Coach said something like ""Never in my twenty years of coaching have I seen anyone do this"" as he walked the guy, and he says that phrase a lot, but I'm pretty sure he meant it this time. Apparently the dude was bleeding out of his ass, it was that bad."
405,"&gt; And before i leave, she can just say the word and I'm ready to beat the shit out of him. Her head was down to her knees, she didnt say a word just sobbing. All she did was put her hand on top of my hand and gently squeezed it.

419,"I once dated a half-Korean, half-Mexican girl. Her mother was the Korean, and she found out we began our relationship as an open relationship.

Let's just say it began bitter feelings between us that exist to this day. My ex was the victim of sexual battery in high school, and her mother's response to that was to cut my ex's hair super short and refuse to talk to her for months.

I thought I had seen irrationality before, but Jesus H Christ. There was absolutely *no*  reasoning with that woman, and my ex *still* felt like she was a bad daughter. She was constantly having to struggle with making her mom proud.

I've traveled around Asia for quite a while, but I'd never been exposed to Korean culture. Since then, I've learned just how toxic traditional Korean culture can be both within the family unit, but also on a national scale."

phones) and his boss (knowing he was going to pick up the ring) said he was just in the back of the building doing something...she called back a little while later; his boss said the same thing but says that he can‚Äôt page him or anything and that he‚Äôd give him
the message when he saw him. 

At this point she gets suspicious and decides to call her future FIL to see if he can run down to my boss‚Äôs work to see if he‚Äôs there. So my boss‚Äôs dad (who is unaware of all this) drives down and lo-and-behold, his car is gone and he‚Äôs not at work. Now they BOTH think he‚Äôs up to something. 

He went home a few hours later at his normal time, and she asks him how work was. He makes up an entire lie about his ‚Äúday at work‚Äù, in which she proceeds to lose her shit and tells him she knows everything, asks who he‚Äôs cheating on her with, etc. He tries to cover it up in order to not totally ruin the surprise, but it backfired and she was in tears literally about to pack up her things and walk out the door. That‚Äôs when he finally had to pull the ring out of his pocket and be like THIS IS WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY DOING ARE YOU HAPPY NOW???? And she was like oh....yeah :)"

I dont think I could get over something like that. She can never look at you or her sister the same again.  I'm sorry for your unfortunate situation but you shouldve told her back then. Now she wont be able to trust either of you. And like I said if my future husband came out with ""I slept with your sister before we met,"" I wouldnt be able to overcome that. Good luck my dude."

I cried when I heard my daughter cry for the first time, when she got the vitamin K shot and I think a second shot.

I cried three times before we even left the hospital (already had chapped nipples from improper latching) plus getting low key attitude from the staff their when I asked for a formula bottle because it hurt so bad.

I cried three times in the three days after we got home. (I didn't produce enough so even less sleep and it still hurt...a lot)

My first cry at home was short lived and kind of a happy cry. My mom took the baby so we could sleep a bit and when I sank down on our soft and comfy bed with fresh sheets I let out a whimper that my husband thought was because of pain(unscheduled C-section) and rushed to see what was wrong.

""Oh yeah baby, you know we do.""

469,"*I was getting death stares all the way out the airport.*

Yeah, but you asserted your dominance, that's why they only stared and didn't actually do anything."

472,"Reminds me of a George Carlin bit. ""How does this woman take a shit? Better yet, how does she wipe her ass!? Is she capable of locating her own asshole!?"""
473,"I haven't really been able to say it like how you just put it, but that's pretty much exactly it. No I haven't, I don't really care for therapists, I'm not sure how one could help."
474,"I swear at some point my mother finished like 75% of her sentences with ""... And I guess you'll just send me to the old folk's home when I get old!"""
475,I just spit beer out my nose laughing.  Best comment of the day!
476,What the fuck IS pre nut clarity? Why have I never heard of this phenomenon? I'm only aware of pre nut dick madness and post nut clarity.
477,I am a female and was wondering the same thing.
478,It could have been worse.  Imagine finishing and having post nut clarity.
479,"Yeah, but ""titty juice."" It's worth the price paid."
480,It happened minutes ago? Then text her back and say ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt sleep- guess what I‚Äôm doing now.‚Äô
481,He generates all the power from the bottom
482,"Well, that's enough internet for the day"
483,Thank you
484,"Yeah, jeeez. I told my current GF *before we started dating* that I had kissed her sister and basically flat refused to do anything with now-GF until that was in the open and processed.

Sex and lying about it for years, then *doubling down on it*? That'd make me go livid. I'm pretty sure if that's what had happened with GF's sister and lied to her face about it still years later that I would be single and quite possibly dead."
485,"yeah, especially since he used his real name on tinder so"
486,Double down and reenact that scene from Inglorious Basterds?
487,"Honestly though,  why is pops letting little lad fuck with other passengers?"
488,Why do People still have sex with unlocked doors while other People are in the house ? I really dont get it. And this was totally deserved. Lock your damn doors !
489,Ditto! I'll have nightmares for weeks.
490,"""Rinse and repeat"""
491,"Would you mind if I propose to my girlfriend after we read this tifu? We usually scan top posts together in the evening, just have to figure out how to transition from post to proposal. Yes, I picked up ring this morning, was going to propose before the 29th."
492,"&gt;We may never be able to get a truly accurate count of landlord fuckers.

493,Sorry if I'm being indelicate but you got me curious on how this happened
494,The pre-nut clarity is a life saver
495,I farted and a worm flew out
496,"Congratulations! You know what rock bottom feels like. Now stop digging, you mad man."
497,"Not allowed to have it in the building I work in, nature of the work I do."
498,That‚Äôs what he said too!
499,"I‚Äôve had anal sex quite a lot, though only with two partners. Never had any shit on my dick...worst I ever to was a solitary piece of red pepper üòÉ. Which was funny."
500,"Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist but you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this"
501,It's not real so it doesn't matter
502,He said he was a top.
503,BE PREPAAAAAARED!
504,I have dry earwax but also smell disgusting so idk about that
505,"If they're both boning other guys: OP, this is your chance for a 3-way!"
506,How does her mom look?
507,You deserve to be beaten with rods and cones for this pun but I upvoted you instead
508,r/ cursedcomments
509,Barn animals.

513,It is almost as if...and hear me out here...the whole story is COMPLETELY MADE UP?!
514,"I'm so sorry OP. As a fellow gaybro, it sucks when you find out you're the side ho. But know it doesn't make you any less of a person."
515,Quoth the raven:  it's a Ford
516,"Good! The child shouldn't be exposed to that kind of person. Fuck this 'family is important' shit.

If your family thinks 'titty juice' is an acceptable reason to scream at you, don't fucking let them be around your child.

If I caught anyone in my family screaming at my child for anything short of a life-threatening situation, I'd slap the taste out of their mouths. Screaming at a child doesn't teach them to recognize a behaviour is bad, it teaches them to be afraid of the person screaming at them."
517,i wish
518,Read this while pumping some freshly squeezed titty juice myself. I don‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs called. The monster will still drink it!
519,And I was here expecting you to put your dick in the ring

521,"Being there for support and back up is a lot more than you think it is. I work as a bartender and hear comments about husbands not being able to do things their wives do often. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put the kids to bed, that‚Äôs the wife‚Äôs job!!‚Äù Is a comment I heard last week. A wife‚Äôs job? You as a father cannot (made it out as if he didn‚Äôt even want to) put your child to bed? Gendered roles in parenting and even partnering angers me more than I realize at times. Parenting does NOT require gender roles or even genders at all!!!!!"
522,"I think this might be a lesson for you. Whether the friend was a guy or a girl you slept with, it definitely changes he nature of the relationship for a pronged period of time if not forever. In my experience, there is no sex with friends and then going back to normal."
523,upvoted for cooter
524,"as someone with Asian parents, at least traditional ones like this anyway, and who's dating someone non Asian, shit like this gets blown over, they have no concept of this type of playful 'mood lightening"", shit gets taken too serious, it's fucken annoying. They won't understand the idea of trying to be funny with the labeling to make it easier, man I really hate this shit about Asian culture"
525,"I agree. The hand squeeze is incredibly sad, but it‚Äôs her way of telling you that she knows it‚Äôs not your fault, and she‚Äôs forgiving you."
526,the tow truck's plate was 'FRESH' and there was dice in the mirror
527,"‚ÄúHmm...sex won‚Äôt take too long.  Guess We won‚Äôt lock the door.‚Äù

Said no one ever."
528,Thanks for this suggestion
529,OP should wait for that threesome invitation.
530,It probably explains the urgency to get it on in the lounge  - the bedroom would have given the game away that he was married.
531,25 more LandlordFuckers and I‚Äôm making my account.
532,Why did you go straight for the punch ahah
533,But titty juice is hilarious.
534,Do you have any self-respect?
535,Like a pillow in the eye.
536,"The word ‚Äúchuckle‚Äù, gave me a chuckle."
537,Yeah I read that too... wtf
538,I'd totally call them back and explain... Ya never know what Michael Scott like manager is out there!
539,"See I thought of this afterward, but you know heat of the moment and being in a panic doesn't help lol. Plus this way made for a funnier story to tell over the years haha"
540,I feel like it's fishy too. Happened 20 years ago and he messaged her and got sent a picture? Phone cameras weren't nearly as prevalent back then and when they did have them the resolution was terrible.
541,"Ive struggled with this one. I'm really not sure. Yes after the fact it sucks hard, but being ignorant.....I dont know."
542,I cringed so hard at your attempt to sound clever with the doggy style comment.
543,"Why? Cause I rap about, reality? Like me n my grandma drinking a cup o tea?"
544,So what you're saying is your random hookup has a key to your apartment...
545,There ain‚Äôt no party like my nana‚Äôs tea party.
546,"Rename it mammary milkshake or something, can't get stroppy about that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or like, tell them to hop"
547,"Yeah, all this many of them in this thread. Bruh. In all seriousness, I hope you're doing ok, man. Sending the good vibes your way."
548,OP is actually 70yo
549,To bad you didn‚Äôt**
550,No you fuck that one twice
551,Where is it being made a fetish? And the baby doesn‚Äôt know how to read and can‚Äôt understand English yet. It doesn‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre making jokes about it‚Äôs food. If anything the baby would be positively impacted by the happy parents who know how to joke around and have fun
552,Not sure what that has to do with holding a phone upside down but thank you for the explanation.
553,I think that's more her fuck up for not only barging into your house unannounced but into your bedroom
554,Definitely not in a healthy state of mind
555,Millions of miles of open...swamp.
556,Username checks out
557,"Came here for this. !

558,Looks like your roommate didn‚Äôt read that ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stick your dick in a shampoo bottle‚Äù copypasta
559,Usually the landlords wait till after you move in to fuck ya over.
560,"Unless he does have a twin who uses Steve's name to prowl tinder for sex with other men. Hey, it's out there."
561,"Tbh, the father should have been paying more attention to his kid. Yes, the punch was perhaps a bit hasty, but kids need to be taught to respect other people‚Äôs space, especially involving touching other people‚Äôs shit. ESPECIALLY if said item is being WORN by the person. That said, maybe try to temper your reactions a touch."
562,"men are men gay or straight. Why does everyone assume gay men are better? Trust me, they are just as awful."
563,"Plot twist #2, steve was sent by the wife to hunt for a matching 3 some, after contract was done steve tells wife that the new tenant made the cut for rent but not for bed."
564,"You probably didn't also fuck their immediate family and then swear that fact to secrecy, either."
565,"Actually it's possible that landlordfucker through landlordfucker41 includes at least one repeat who threw away their first account, fucked another landlord, and then made another throwaway account. We may never be able to get a truly accurate count of landlord fuckers."
566,I‚Äôm genuinely disturbed.
567,"I don't think that quite qualifies as a fuck up. Had you been caught, probably, but you weren't. And now you've peaked my interest. And I hate you for that."
568,"&gt;I did not sign up for this

&gt;(Signs up for this)"
569,"Why the fuck was her asshole so dirty, though? I mean, doesn't she actually wipe it?"
570,That's 4 cents chief
571,You mean common sense right
572,At least you‚Äôre able to talk abut with the FIL. I just have to sit there and take their shit and bite my tongue :/
573,"Just before the end I started to think this was a shitpost that was going to transition into song lyrics or a tongue twister. Given how absurd it seemed by the end, I am actually more surprised that it was a normal story!"
574,Right? When your parent stops seeing you as their child and only sees you as the parent of their grandchild.
575,.....He opens a vagina????
576,Slumlord Steve
577,"It wasn't your fault, not even partially. You met someone, went to his place, hooked up, there's nothing wrong about it. He, on the other hand, is a major asshole who lied to his wife and didn't tell you he's married. What a douche."
578,You've got a good heart. Thank you.
579,MeowwwwwWWWWWWWWCH
580,Yeah he cares more about internet points than not further upsetting his wife. Why even risk it?!
581,"The most I've ever cum was after traveling around with an ex in college, we finally hooked up after weeks of tension and right after I got inside her, her relatives that we were staying with knocked, so I pulled out and jumped into my bed with the covers over me. The sudden movement set me off, and while I'm sitting there trying to act casual I was pumping almost a solid inch of cum into the condom I was wearing."
582,"It's not just mentally scaring, you can get a real bad chaff going. Then every time you get hard after that it stretches the scabs off so bam, now you're awake and your dick stings."
583,I've avoided spray all my life because of the gross kids in the lockerroom that would create walls and walls of it every day after gym class. I got some in a little target 5$ toiletry thing one time and realized I really like it! Dove for men clean comfort. It's pleasant and light. Not all spray deoderant sucks as much as axe.
584,"Will do. Fingers crossed an older coworker says usually you‚Äôll see a random third person, who is actually HR, RSVP‚Äôd to the meeting if you‚Äôre getting fired. So we‚Äôll see..."
585,"Because, sadly, infidelity is more common than healthy non-monogamy :("
586,"It would have to, because I actually enjoyed reading this. üòÇ"
587,Social anxiety's a helluva drug
588,Or they have an open marriage guys. That could just be how they do things. Don't know why that hasn't come up as an option here.
589,You should probably get that chuckled out
590,Are you bottlenosed?
591,"I think the asssumption can usually safely be that the microphone and speaker are vertically reversed. I'd use ""backwards"" for screen-away."
592,I feel absolutely filthy for just reading it.
593,Love that she admitted it. Most people would have blamed bad reception or something.
594,"Maybe take a bottle of freshly squeezed man juice as an offering?

Or just break both your arms"
595,Is his name Steve by any chance?
596,It‚Äôs better from the tap
597,"He's out there in the middle of nowhere, with some chick he barely know, looks around and what does he see?"
598,"If you're about to be single, you should at least be single with a shit ton of karma.

I should post the story behind my breakup, but i think that's too much FU for TIFU."
599,My mom was complaining that the smoke alarm wasn't working right because it should be going off. I cleaned her glasses for her and she got embarrassed.
600,Yeah I had to picture the tow truck driver getting in on the action before I was able to cum.
601,r/teenagers rise up
602,She stayed to finish the video. She has established dominance. You have my regards.

606,Exactly what I was thinking!
607,Dude. I would have turned around as soon as those first odors struck my nose.
608,"you should join Tinder, tons of bots on there."
609,I would only be shocked if it was that few. I expect more from reddit users
610,What a weird thing to lie about.
611,"It was more I felt reckless. I was kinda drawn into the couple thing because I knew it was fucked up and dangerous. Saying it was out of character is an understatement, but that day I could not give a single fuck."
612,Glad to see I‚Äôm not alone.
613,"Congratulations, you raped yourself."
614,"Honestly I assumed OP was a dude cause most girls at least meet up in public first. This sounded like a typical grindr encounter.

Also while unlikely, there's a chance OP's landlord is in an open marriage."
615,"""On the one hand, they might murder me or rob me. Best case scenario, I have sex with whatever smells like this beef stew and B.O. But on the other hand, it'd be rude to back out now. I'd better just be polite and keep going."""
616,"break up with her, then she wont suspect"
617,"I totally missread the title... ""Walked in on my wife's sister and cousin in a crucial part of intercourse""...
Thought I was about to read another Alabama story on tifu xD"
618,43 if you count landlordfucker and landlordfucker1
619,"We‚Äôve all tried it, only the needle dicks can do it. I‚Äôm kinda envious"
620,We have witnessed the birth of an internet legend.
621,huh?
622,You're a 7 on the closeness scale but felt comfortable enough to beg her for some menstrual blood... dude. Wtf.
623,Gave them a laugh and a reason to call you - I say it‚Äôs not a FU but a successful initiative piece there
