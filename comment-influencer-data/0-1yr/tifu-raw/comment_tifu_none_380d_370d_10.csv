5,"And this is where you tell her: ""Okay, feel free to have the baby, then send a paternity test my way.""

12,"Female here. While it’s possible to have sex one time and get someone pregnant, it would take a MINIMUM of 11-14 days post coitus to come up positive on a pregnancy test.  Any sooner than that, and the possibility of it being yours is nearly impossible. I would go no contact with this woman ASAP. I’m sorry she is manipulating you. 

Pregnancy is very scientific and there is only actually 24-36 hours a month where a woman is fertile.

38,"Ok, here is some motherly advice. Never, ever, sign a birth certificate until you receive the results of a paternity test. The birth certificate is a legal document. If you sign it, you accept legal responsibility for the child. There was a case years ago where a guy divorced his wife and discovered that half of the children he signed the birth certificates for were not biologically his because she was a serial cheater. Courts didn't care. He signed the birth certificates, so he was the legal father and was expected to pay child support. If you ever sign a birth certificate, be absolutely sure you are the biological father."

Because there is no way she got a positive pregnancy test a week after sex. Absolutely no way. Tell her you know that the baby cannot possibly be yours, and insist on a paternity test if she ever tries to pin it on you.

Do you want an STI? Because that's how you get an STI."
74,"Just end contact with her ASAP. There is nothing to be gained anymore by talking to her. Something like this, ""At this point there is nothing we can do. It is too early for a paternity test, and our conversations so far have not been productive. Further down the line I will be more than willing to take a paternity test, but until that point comes I don't think it is a good idea to talk to each other.""

Just shut down the conversation. There are a few possibilities going on here, and none of them benefit from you continuing to try to poke holes in her story (because she's now proven herself to be either mentally unstable and/or desperate).

1. She is actually pregnant with your child. Very unlikely, but even if this is the case you won't be able to find out till later on anyways. This bridge can be crossed down the line if it is actually the case.
2. She is actually pregnant with someone else's kid. More likely, but once again nothing can be done until a paternity test.
3. She isn't pregnant at all and for some misguided (mentally unstable) reason she is committed to convincing you she is. Maybe she has attachment issues and feels this is a way to secure you as her ""boyfriend"". Maybe she has a personality disorder, Maybe she's a drug addict and thinks she can pimp out money from you. Maybe she has one of any other psychological disorders that makes her rationalize it.

No matter which of these three options is the case, she's unstable. If you cut off contact she will get bored and move on hopefully."

On a NATO deployment to Norway  in 1979, as we were wrapping up dinner,  a friend of mine threw his leftover C-rat box into the campfire and walked into the woods for a piss.  An upopened jelly tin in his trash exploded from the heat, sending white-hot grape napalm all over those of us still gathered round the fire.  One guy caught some it in the groin and had to see the corpsman; I caught a bit on my forehead that left a burn that morphed into a festering scab that stuck around for several weeks (until I scrubbed it with a stiff brush and removed what appeared to be intact grape jelly).  My friend later said that when he heard the explosion followed by a volley of swearing, he remembered his jelly tin and thought to himself, ""Well, this is not not going to be good when I go back.""

They find a wrapped bundle of Japanese knives ranging from 6”-10” and one of them starts freaking out like I was hiding a gun, while I sit there looking confused as to why he is upset by my *tools*. 

“What are these for!? Why would you have these on you on your way to a bar!?”  I realized in that moment that not everyone sees a chefs knife as a tool, and it could be misconstrued for a weapon. So naturally I said “I would never use these on a person, they’re too expensive!” Thankfully the more experienced officer saw my confusion and explained to the green guy that “He’s had a long shift and just wants a drink, and someone who doesn’t even think about the implications of carrying around his “tools” is not the type of person to use them as a weapon.”

The result: a vicious cycle of even more tears and even more scar tissue in the future, eventually resulting in painful erections even when not torn. Also speaking from experience, the only way to correct that sort of scar tissue is by removing it surgically via a procedure called a frenulectomy.

Spare (spear?) your penis and see your regular doctor or a urologist. If they say it's nothing, great. If they want to take corrective action now, maybe give you a prescription, to, ahem, head off trouble later, great.

Post frenulectomy, my urologist instructed me to keep Neosporin on the site to keep the tissue soft and prevent the formation of additional scar tissue. I'd encourage you to do this in your situation as well. Remember, scar tissue = bad. I think I was to apply Neosporin three times a day for 1-2 weeks.

After using it for days, the Neosporin started to irritate my skin, at which point my urologist said I could discontinue it.

Good luck!"
200,did you ever think that maybe the red was from the jello?
201,maybe you should stick to big sticks or guns 
202,My amazing boyfriend is going to sanitize the can for me when he gets here tomorrow. I’ll get bleach. Thank you for the advice. 
203,OP shoots so hard his jizz can time travel.
204,"Yeah. I was like ""Damn, OP knows more about the menstrual cycle than me"""
205,And fap into it?
206,"*slaps roof*

This badboy can fit so many incriminating posts!"
207,Is there really that small of a window for conception? I can't believe I've never heard that.
208,"I'm unusually decent at handling bugs and rotting meat and shit. 

I know full well I would nope out of there before I could even say nope."
209,"Please go to the doctors. People regularly overdose and die doing this. Please get a liver function test done too. I'm not meaning to scare you, but you did the bum equivalent of mainlining alcohol. The body usually digests and metabolises booze, and it ends ups in a 'safe' quantity in your body. If it's too much, you vomit before you get alcohol poisoning.

You did the nearest thing to actually injecting booze into your blood stream. You are so so so fucking lucky nothing worse happened. People often shed their intestinal lining (looks like a pink jelly) after doing this, which can affect fluid/nutrition absorption etc. or even cause permanent/acute damage like ulceration, haemorrhaging or worse.

If you think I'm being extreme, let me tell you that this outcome was incredibly mild and lucky. As in, I've heard of people needing to get colostomy bags because of doing this, and worse - liver failure, cirrhosis, internal bleeding and/or death. 

Please please go to the Dr and never do anything remotely adventurous again without Googling it first, this is how people end up getting Darwin awards. I hope to god you're not doing any remotely science/health based degree. I'm not trying to be a dick, but bloody hell man - the last person I heard of that did this was an alcoholic with throat cancer, he got his wife to prepare a vodka enema and he died (from an amount he would safely drink). 

**Edit**: I've reread my comment, and I apologise for the urgency but I assume you've never seen or experienced someone dying from overdose. If you have, I apologise and empathise - I don't mean to patronise you and feel free to PM. You can anyway, and I feel terrible for potentially scaring you, but this is important. 

I used to be a therapist and am happy to say that none of my own clients (I know of) did this, but unfortunately I've personally experienced people dying from overdose both intentionally and not, and it's such a shitty way to die. To put it bluntly - if we were at a party together and you did this, I would take you to A&amp;E myself or call a taxi to take you (not wasting ambulance resources on shit like this). If I can scare you and your friends into valuing life over some fratboy party points then I feel my job was worth it. Nothing ever is worth your health. It's the only thing you can't buy back.

**Edit 2**: I've just realised I've been a techy health asshole and used techy health words. Again, at the risk of being patronising (I'm really not!)

Liver function test: simple blood test to check your enzyme levels etc. There is a specific enzyme/level that deals with alcohol called Gamma-Glutamyl that  checks if you have alcohol related liver damage.

Enema: a liquid preparation that is introduced up the bum, can be medicinal or not. The solid version would be called a suppository.

Cirrhosis: scarring and inflammation of the liver, usually caused by alcoholism or a disease such as hepatitis 

Haemorrhaging: bleeding a lot

Colostomy: medical intervention of the bowels, at the colon meaning your lower bowel/colon is rerouted into a stoma (hole in the side of your body) and your poo goes in a bag that you empty. Another variation is an ileostomy, where the ileum (upper bowel) is rerouted into a bag. This can be temporary or permanent. Ileostomies result in a more liquid-type poo, colostomies are more solid. Both are incredibly life-changing/saving/improving surgeries when performed under certain conditions, however they are also common in traumatic surgery patients.

212,If you need to ask you're probably in trouble already. 
213,"It seems really unlikely that you are the daddy because of the date of your intercourse to the date she found out she was pregnant. That said, mifepristone is the drug she would have taken in the clinic that blocks her body’s reception of progesterone. That would have almost always happened in a clinic. Misoprostol is what she would take at home to actually induce the abortion.  So if she was telling the truth, that’s probably what she meant.

Still, seems really unlikely, and definitely get the dates. She’s definitely manipulative. 

EDIT: timing fertility can be tricky. Some women have cycles over 30 days. Some less than 21. The time from implantation to a positive pregnancy test is what makes me feel really iffy about this. "

227,"I was speaking with a very pregnant lady at a party. After a while I confessed that I couldn't remember her name. She reintroduced herself and added my name at the end too. 

I said I was surprised that she remembered me from weeks earlier, and she went ""Oh, I'm an elephant.""

I pointed to her belly and said I hadn't noticed. She paused, and then added ""....because I have a good memory."""
228,"&gt; Also I believe this is 100% my fault. I made the decisions that led to this. 

No. Your dad is an asshole. Don't give your kids numbers to randos and don't sell their property without their consent. And double down on being an asshole after being called out for it too."
229,"Paternity tests can be done in the womb, too, if she wants to push it. It’s a blood test. Done as early as 10 weeks. I know because I was with a friend when she had one done. She wants to keep the pregnancy and keep blaming it on you? If she won’t leave you alone, hit her with that. It’s expensive, not gonna lie, but it will hold up in court and show you’re not the dad, I’d be willing to bet. "
230,"Well ok, these are pretty broad generalizations. Context is important, but off the top of my head:

-She happily explains she doesn't have any girlfriends because she ""just doesn't get along with girls""

- on FB she posts a lot of ""why me?! God I'm such a victim of injustice!!"" Posts

- her laugh sounds nervous and loud. Read: she is trying to simulate a genuine emotion, because her real emotions are shoved, deep, deep down

- she hates all your chick-friends for no stated reason. Read: ""my self-esteem trumps your personal freedom""

- all girls cry, like at the sappy movies or veteran-coming-home-to-his-dog gifs, but crazy girls don't wipe their tears or dab their runny mascara, and they cry audibly at that shit. Read: ""fix my emotions for me!! I have no coping methods!""

-calling at strange hours, when she knows you are busy. Read: ""I have no boundaries and I am becoming codependent on you""

232,Whatever sick and twisted world this chick is living in don’t get sucked in with her. The kid isn’t yours. 
233,"If it’s positive and she’s insisting it is yours, might not be a bad idea to consult a lawyer and eventually demand a paternity test. Don’t take her word for it that she “won’t ask anything of you” 

Crazy is crazy, and if she’s pregnant with someone else’s kid, she’s going to try to get child support from you because you believed her. "

245,"Outside of the timeline, the thing that makes me most suspicious is her story about the blood test: First of all, she immediately took pregnancy test after you guys had sex. She was not even due for her period yet, so she wasn’t late and would almost certainly not be showing any signs of pregnancy so early. The overwhelming majority of women who are not actively trying to get pregnant will not take a pregnancy test unless they are experiencing symptoms. Did you ask her why she took the test in the first place? 

Also, you said she had access to the test because she’s “a nurse”. It could totally be different in other places, but where I work a blood test would require an order from a doctor, who would have had to agree that it was reasonable to test her. Nurses don’t just have free access to blood tests. And if she found a way to “sneak” a test in, you could threaten to report her to her workplace. "
