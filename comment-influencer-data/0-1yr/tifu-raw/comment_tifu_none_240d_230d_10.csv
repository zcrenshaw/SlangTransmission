0,OP please go back with a fresh box of eggs for him and we promise to attend your funeral.
1,Maybe that game might not be the greatest for you two to play anymore. 
2,"You got a chainsaw the first time you went with a highlighter, so you go back with a whole pack? Oh man"
3,"I'm a middle-aged guy, not married anymore, but had a good marriage for 15 years before we drifted apart and parted amicably. One thing we realized together over the years is that, while light-hearted picking on each other can be fun at times, it's dangerous to get into the habit. Anytime we started drifting too far into making fun of each other, one of us would say ""talk to me like you love me"". That blew the whistle on what we were doing and re-focused us on supporting each other. It's fun to be silly with someone who you know loves you completely, but no matter how thick your shell, or where you wear your heart, we all need to be reminded by the person we care about the most that they love us deeply."
4,"Insult game is not a wise choice of game. Try checkers, maybe?"
5,And what have we learned in today's risk/reward class? The only winning move is not to play.
6,You dodged a bullet. Twice. Why do you keep putting your fucking face in front of the fucking bullet and giving highlighters to this serial killer in training?
7,"“What I meant to say was *VAPE* baby*.
"
8,"""What is your deal, babe? Did they not teach you in school how periods work? Women lose all their enzymes and vitamins through their blood when they get their period, so they have to rub the blood all over their skin immediately so they can reabsorb them."""
9,He's a lucky guy. The fact that this was genuinely important to you is extremely telling. It sounds like you're lucky to have him too. So many people are incapable of sticking around at even the slightest sign of trouble. Don't ever lose that caring spark. I wish you both the happiest of futures. 
10,I was so worried this wouldn’t have a happy ending.
11,The danger with pushing buttons for fun is the chance you stumble upon a button that works.
12,"I wouldn't even bother with a police report about the egg. I'd file one for the chainsaw. And the next call would be to child protection services if the brother is under 18.

That kid is gonna be a serial killer or mass murderer. 

Then I'd wipe my hands off them and NEVER contact them again. "
13,Florida boy attacked sister's boyfriend with chainsaw for stealing his highlighter
14,I called my friend a failed abortion before. Turned out it was true. I just apologised instantly. Do something nice to make up for it and avoid the subject in future. Maybe be something to laugh about after time. 
15,"**Never try monopoly,** that shit destroys families."
16,"A lot of severe mental health issues can manifest in high school. This child needs some serious help from professionals. There is nothing you can do to help at this point, and keeping in contact with the family is just going to make matters worse. Back away and hope that the parents get their shit together and get him the help he needs. "
17,"Bring a box of eggs and Chainsaw fuel. Say ""I wanted to compensate you for your expenses"". Do this @OP and you will live on forever in reddit history as the person with balls of fucking osmium u/jenniferlopezio 


"
18,Or maybe OP is just shitting us with made-up stories.
19,"&gt;This is the part when the dumbass inside of me starts to show signs of life.

Couldn't have put it better myself.

"
20,"""so when he tried to kill me for buying 1 highlighter, I bought him a bag fucking full of them"" "
21,At least you won the insult contest. Seems like a win to me.
22,Call the police and file a report. He threatened you with a chainsaw and that kid needs to be transported to the hospital and evaluated.
23,Imagine if she finds out you posted online shes a rape baby.. dont think she will accept your chicken breast apology then lmao. Im snitchin 🤨
24,That happened to my dad. He had to pay 150. Apparently  someone certified in the repair of gas pumps and licensed by the state has to rehook it. That's why it costs so much. 
25,Imagine anonymously mailing them highlighters every month... 
26,"*a few sentences in*

""Oof Ted is one unlucky fish""

*after finishing*

""Phew, Ted is one lucky fish"""
27,"Hey OP, if you haven’t done so already, next time you see a doctor, have them check your inner ear to see if there might be something resulting in a balance issue. While it’s mostly sprains you’ve experienced so far, it would really suck to break something. In the mean time, speedy recovery!"
28,"Thank you so much! I feel very loved, even my dog has been cuddling and ""watching over me""

I feel blessed every day with him. I try to do things to make our relationship a partnership, but he is so much better at it than I am lol!"
29,"This is up there with the guy who’s girlfriend used coffee grounds to exfoliate in the shower, he thought she was shitting in the shower and waffle stomped it down the drain for weeks before saying anything..."
30,"Omg well, that game won’t be played anymore! 

Snickered when your natural response was to make her a chicken breast and a beer lol. Very kind. "
31,Make sure to let cps know to arrive with a highlighter so that they can see the full extent of what they are working with. 
32,"Well it's the thought that counts, right?"
33,For real. The kids behaviour is one thing. The parents actually believing anything this little shit says and actually lecturing you over a highlighter ( who cares if you actually had taken one like Wtf) is a lot more worrying.
34,"Ooh, my brother has an inner ear problem, but I never got checked. I will as soon as possible. Thank you."
35,"Holy shit. Call CPS immediately. Her brother is going to KILL someone or maybe even KILL himself one day. You cannot let that situation continue in that household. Please, for the sake of humanity, that boy needs help and the public needs protection. Call CPS at once and let them sort it out. The brother needs help immediately before someone loses their life. The parents are disgusting enablers."
36,pic of cozy ted in his clean tank plz
37,"With a two parter? No... OP is just giving us the details in a concise fashion to help us process what really happened in manageable chunks. Nothing to do with the karma, nothing at all..."
38,"Yeah that’s what I figured, I’m not even mad about it cause it was just so damn funny "
39,"This TIFU has been a wild ride from start to finish, I feel bad about the circumstances for you OP but god damn you just can't make this shit up lmao"
40,That spunky egg salesman pitch will be his final words before being eggsecuted on the doorstep.
41,"This morning she was still obviously not happy with me, I did win the insult contest tho so I’ve got that going for me "
42,Why would you tell your kid that? Horrible parent
43,You missed the perfect opportunity to look him dead in the eyes and hiss. 
44,"Joke is on your boss, she didn't realize you have a public humiliation kink. "
45,"Oof, that's even worse"
46,"Yeah, definitely! Maybe four years from now he will fall and I will carefully go to help him, after learning from this lol"
47,Safe words: not just for naughty stuff!
48,"&gt;The bigger question here is, what exactly does a ""rape baby"" look like?

Don't you think it's a little insensitive to ask op for a picture of his girlfriend under these circumstances? "
49,You can do better . Find a way to trip him .
50,"He was obviously doing it to get the girl back, thinking it wouldn't be a big deal, which it shoudn't have been. That kid sounds like he's got serous issues.  What a nightmare. "
51,"One of the old wives' tales I remember from my preadolescent years was that washing your face with the bloody water* from your first period will make you acne-free for life. (Philippines)

*First period bleeds on panty, wash panty in basin of water, wash face with that water."
52,Yeah imagine having a parent who vapes. Just abort me pls
53,I’m thinking the same thing 
54,Honestly I'd pitch in to buy a pack and ship them there. We could have hundreds of highlighters on that porch by tomorrow afternoon.
55,ಠ╭╮ಠ
56,"Stop going back there with highlighters, it's doing nothing to lighten up the situation. Stay away from any office supply stores and you should be fine."
57,Everyone's blaming the kid but the parents are just as complicit in this anarchy.
58,"I know. Why the heck did you think that was a good idea? Honestly, you sound like you're probably in high school, and you should have respected their wishes and stay away from their family.

FYI ""I hope we can still be friends"" is just a polite way to end a relationship and it's probably about half in half that the girl doesn't actually care if you remain friends."
59,Seriously what the fuck? OP is an idiot.
60,Now we just need to hear his Ted talk
61,But I’ll never retire if I don’t invest though
62,"Same thing with ""Risk"".

I should have listened to the name."
63,"Yes.  This is signs of unmedicated mental issues, and it sounds like the family has just kept it in the family the whole kids life, so there is no positive outcomes made to help this kid grow and be as successful as he can be in life.  He needs to see a psych doctor, and be evaluated as far as threat to others.  I agree with contacting the police, although there hands will be tied some because you cannot force anyone to do what needs done.  This is just sad to me overall.

Note: I have family members with mental disorders, and have worked with the Developmentally disabled for years.  "
64,Dude snitched on himself! And for karma too. tsk tsk. 
65,"Literally 90+ % of all drama I have been in during my adult life has come from tossing friendly insults with friends and family. A few years ago I decided to only say encouraging things to them, and three things happened after that decision.  


1 - I stopped getting in pointless fights with people  
2 - People slowed and nearly stopped tossing zingers my way, and slowly started to replace them with encouraging and nice remarks  
3 - My relationships in general strengthened, as did my self esteem. And the same happened with my friends and family.  


Drama around me is now at an all time low. I super encourage people to try this for a while and see what happens in their lives too. So worth it."
66,She must be pretty hot 😂
67,"This is a brilliant idea

69,"The same poster claimed he got into a fight with his gf’s brother over spoiling Avengers yesterday and was “banned from her house” and dumped then too. He deleted it before posting this one.

So good job on his part upping the ante."
70,Married 25 years with two girls who've since moved out. I don't think this would have even phased me if I'd walked in on wifey. 😄
71,$200 for a story you can tell until you're old and forget it. Worth it.
72,"their entire family is fucked up, why the hell is the girl free of blame here for not warning op that her family is legit batshit"
73,"&gt; Snickered when your natural response was to make her a chicken breast and a beer lol. Very kind.

You may enjoy my cousin's panic response when be saw me crying. I was staying with him due an emergency evacuation situation and I was having a quiet cry because I thought I was alone.

He literally *backed away in panic,* realized he was cornered because he had backed himself into the kitchen, and then desperately offered me a pickle.

My cousin is awesome, but damn...he really should not have a ""fight, flight, or freeze"" response when faced with tears! The pickle offer was cool though, I stopped crying because I was laughing so hard."
74,I asked that. My friend asked her mum when she had a pregnancy scare and her mum told her the whole story. 
75,"“So if you do have to have an abortion, make sure they do a thorough job, or you’ll end up like me!”"
76,"Time to apologize. Do not claim ""tourettes"". Claim you're an idiot."
77,"Gotta get my hands on some clear wire. I would hide around the corner and pull it taut when he walks by.

Knowing how these things go he would probably pull me down. LOL"
78,"Im glad Ted is ok! Props to you for taking care of your fish, my family has 1 fish to keep up with and they always forget to feed it, never clean and they let the water get to about an inch deep before they do anything with it"
79,"This, OP you have their address so you can have the highlighters delivered directly to him."
80,"&gt; married to two..

Oh my. Kids. We had two kids. "
81,*TIFU by getting my whole family to play a prank on my sister's boyfriend and getting taken to a mental hospital.*
82,"Ah yes, Caress. I love that bodywash.

I pictured this so vividly. Granted my bf didn't see me rubbing blood red bodywash all over me but, it was such a satisfying red color I can just see it.

If people want to smell good and look like Carrie, definitely try it lol"
83,I think that whole family needs to be medicated because how can the parents just coddle this kids issues and act like it’s all real? Fucked up. 
84,OP is a few highlighters short of a pack too from what it seems. 
85,"Shrink here, not that it takes one to figure this out.  Clearly from the two stories put together, this kid is being completely enabled and even empowered to disrupt all of their lives with his mental issues.  The parents are clearly in denial and not dealing with it.  CPS is the absolute best route to take here, for the safety of the daughter, if for no other reason.  OP should have his parents call the police and ask them to contact CPS, in fact.  Their son was threatened with a deadly weapon, had his car vandalized, and is now going to have to wonder if this psycho kid whose parents aren't getting him help is going to come after him at some point."
86,I can just imagine the laughing fit the attendant must’ve had after witnessing all of that. You probably made her day!
87,"Rule of thumb for teasing - it's not funny if it's not funny to the person being teased.  

Some things are just too close to home; and you may find out the hard way what deep hurts or insecurities someone is harbouring. "
88,You'll NEVER believe what happened when this guy stole THIS
89,"OP, I'm glad everything turned out okay.

I think you are really going to get ahead in life."
90,"tldr: I escaped with my life, but then went back to poke the bear. "
91,"Hollup, you need to Link to this amazing story. "
92,And this is why I don’t like that game. My current bf tries to tease me sometimes. I hate it. Nothing like being reminded of elementary school. Being teased all day just because my skin is a different colour. 
93,"A+ advice.

Please do this."
94,"Yeah, honestly, I put a *lot* more blame on the parents.  There is *no way* the first incident was the first ever occurrence of this kind of thing.  How in god's name are you going to pat an innocent guy down, escort him out of your home, and blame him for something he clearly didn't do, because your mentally unstable child is having a fit about it?"
95,"I'm an attorney, and the chainsaw incident is textbook criminal assault.  You need to report this to the police.  

It really sounds like the parents are trying to cover up for and excuse this kid's behavior when he needs some serious psychiatric help.  If the parents have lost control of the kid to the point where something like the chainsaw incident can happen, then responsibility for the kid needs to be taken out of their hands.  You escaped with just minor vandalism, but the next person who encounters this kid may not be so lucky."
96,Really though. Both times op like “haha better happy-go-lucky myself back in.” Like... dude. Another human being threatened your life with a chainsaw. This isn’t a game. Only an absolute idiot would go back a third time. 
97,"I feel like you are a bit self depreciating, which is great for humor and humility. But try not to be hard on yourself. You seem to be a genuinely good person and partner and I'm sure he sees that and loves you for it. It's not a competition. 😉"
98,"With that kind of game, a line was going to be crossed at some point..now you know where her line is at..but she does not know yours.. I imagine we will be seeing her story on r/TIFU someday as well if you guys continue playing.."
99,"The bigger question here is, what exactly does a ""rape baby"" look like?  I can't even fathom anything that would make me think ""you look like a rape baby"", let alone say something like that, and I've done and said some pretty fucking stupid shit in my time."
100,"Haha, thank you 😂

Well, I actually don’t have that kink, and I have slight PTSD with humiliation due to some father issues. I suppose that explains why I’m into daddy dom... but I really don’t wanna think about that..."
101,"*In ten years*

&gt; TIFU by turning my ex's brother turn into America's worst serial killer "
102,"I get that. Humor is great medicine. But I notice your last line, sorry. Why do you feel it's important who does more? You're giving it your all, genuinely and wholeheartedly. That's more than enough and all that matters. 

I'm not big on religion, but there's a great parable in the Bible. Rich men donating, and a poor woman as well. Jesus states that though the value of the coin she deposited was of a drastically smaller quantity than those of the rich, hers was more valuable because it was all she had, whereas the rich gave what they had to spare. It doesn't apply precisely, since the point is not to measure who gives more between you and him. But my point is, if you're giving all you've got, the value of what you do is immeasurable, and I'm sure he knows that. But more importantly, you should know that as well. "
103,"My dad did this once and drove to work with it still in his tank. Twic has ripped off the nozzles.  Didn't have to pay. Also damaged a slushie machine and ripped the lever off that makes the slushie come out and go in the cup. As he apologized and was told to leave and we are walking to the car, he realizes he still has the lever in his hand. We're not allowed back at that was station. "
104,"Me and my husband do something similar, except ours is a high pitched “GODDAMN Y U SO MEAN?”"
105,"winning a game of risk&gt;relationships  


its hard being on top sometimes"
106,"Nothing about this story makes any sense at all. I know there are some crazy families in the world, but every person in this story acts irrationally to a point that almost seems statistically impossible. 

Let’s start with the girlfriend. She likes you enough to introduce you to the family, but gives you no warning as to her brother’s obvious mental deficiencies. Not even a heads up about staying away from his stuff? Then, when he goes crazy, repeating behavior she’s obviously dealt with before, she gets angry at you. It makes no sense.

Her parents are another oddity. Why, given the fact that their son has some known issues, would they also choose to side with him? Maybe they would, but it seems more likely they’d be really apologetic instead.

And, then there’s you, OP. This kid freaks on you, and you leave after getting the low down on the situation. Then, you come back with a highlighter as a joke. I could maybe see teenage me doing something like that, hoping I could charm the whole thing away. The part that doesn’t make sense is that you get threatened by a chainsaw-wielding maniac, and then double down on the joke by going back with more highlighters! You’re either crazy too, suicidal, or dense.

I think there are two probable answers as to why everyone in this situation seems so unbelievably irrational. Either, one, you made the whole thing up. Or, two, you are kind of crazy, and the girlfriend asked for her family’s help to get rid of you. If you really did keep going back after all of this, I’d be inclined to see a pattern of behavior that borders on obsessive. Pretty good odds she had been trying to get rid of you for months, and finally enlisted her family to drive you away.

It’s probably the first one, and you made the whole thing up. If not, I hope you’ve learned your lesson, and do finally stay away, whether her family is really this crazy, or it was all an act."
107,"That was my plan, reporting about the egging first and then filling them in with more details."
108,"It also wouldn’t hurt to talk to your doctor about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  It’s pretty rare, but can cause a lot of issues with your joints being unstable and spraining frequently. "
109,"Oh, and congratulations to you and your boyfriend on the engagement! "
110,They will be a part 3 where the family and dog all show up to OPs home so the brother can battle it out with OP. OPs dad will do something crazy (but not that violent) like shoot paper hornets at the family until they leave. Part 4 will see OP go back to their house to hand a highlighter to the son but the girlfriend this time will do something crazy.
111,yea that kid needs to be medicated. paranoid delusions can get murdery.
112,"You were pretty dumb to go back lmfaooooo especially with a highlighter, lol. Live and learn ig"
113,OP.  PLEASE edit your op so we can send them highlighters!!!!
114,The madman went back with a full pack of highlighters lmfaooo
115,"Is OP an idiot, though? I mean, they were both voluntarily playing a fairly nasty game with each other.  OP was just unlucky to have hit the insult that happened to be a soft spot for her."
116,"Seems to be the only explanation for OPs behaviour. Constantly going back to somehow impress the crazy brother certainly seems to suggest that. 

OR. He was just deeply madly in love with her. Just in two months. No big deal. It happens. He just needs to go back again. This time with a whole box of highlighters. That ought to win them over. "
117,"Mistakes can and will happen, don't think she'll forget about it, people never forget how you make them feel.
Go apologise and do something nice for her to not look like and absolute asshole.

121,"My current GF is probably the nicest human I've ever met, and can't stand even pretend meanness. She said something slightly cheeky yesterday, and I pretended to shut the bathroom door in her face (slowly!) and she legit started to cry. As a result, she never has to remind me to ""talk to her like I love her"". I always do. And ya know....it's pretty damn awesome."
122,Next time you should do something to make sure people realize that your not just a disembodied head. I’d recommend getting a glow in the dark skull tattooed on your face and shrieking like a banshee so people know that your alive and well 
123,They're in denial. I've got a socially disabled cousin and her parents were too proud to get her help. Now she's barely functional and still live with her parents. She doesn't recognize how toxic her father is and why her mother left him.
124,"Damn son. You bought a one way ticket to hell with that one. 

I did for laughing. "
125,Laughed my cloud off
126,"Hahahaha that’s fantastic. Tbh OP you would be a legend if you did this. You can even just leave eggs at the door with a big red bow on them, and run."
127,"Someone else mentioned that too, I was looking it up a bit earlier. I don't have double joints or stretchy skin or anything, but I plan to bring it up when I go to the doctor.

The more I am talking about it, the more I realize that I might have an actual problem.

Either way we are definitely investing in a pair of crutches and I am thinking of trying some yoga to strengthen myself more, or at least be more graceful lol."

129,"I try not to overdo it. Sometimes we gotta make fun of ourselves to get over a tough situation.

130,"We definitely have a wonderful relationship. I have had some bad ones, and I am his ""first"" girlfriend. 

In middle and high school we were sweethearts long distance over World of Warcraft. We broke up and reconnected as adults. He moved to KS for me. Sometimes it feels storybook."
131,Congrats.  You're officially stupid enough to be a cop.  Well done.
132,"Hate to say it but I agree. He's going to end up inpatient psych or jail sooner or later, you might as well get the ball rolling before he hurts someone. He really needs help and the parents are failing at their parental duties by normalizing the behavior. Also, I'm worried about the dog's safety and the sister who cant have relationships because her brother is so unstable. What else has she had to downplay throughout her life because of her brother?"

He'd steal license plates off the family cars in retaliation for not being allowed to drive. A few occasions he broke windows trying to get back in the house after forgetting his keys and being mad no one would leave their jobs to let him into the house. He yelled at screamed and treated the family like trash, but the patents would blame everyone else, including their daughter, for provoking him. They refused to get him treatment, even when neighbors and teachers would suggest it. I could only hear the stories so much and offer my help to get her away from the house or help her report her brother so many times, each time being refused, before I just had to walk away from the toxicity of the situation. A few years later he bludgeoned his girlfriend to death and locked her toddler in a closet for the girlfriend's mother to find the next day, over a stupid argument."
171,"I dated a hemophobe for years. One tiny drop of blood and he got light headed and had to go sit down. Super fun with an erratic period like mine or emergencies. 

Right after I got out of the relationship with him, I had sex with a butcher. Guy fingered me while I was bleeding and then proceeded to give me a back massage....

I'm not saying it's why I married him, but my husband is a happy middle ground. He doesn't faint at the sight of blood, but he also doesn't feel compelled to play in it either."
172,"Or else, OP is a people-pleaser that can't allow himself leave a bad impression on people to save his life. I feel him. "
173,"Hey! Physiotherapist here

Recurrent ankle sprains are often a result of poor ankle (proprioception)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception], which is generally your sense of body position. People who often sprain their ankles are bad at this! The good news is, you can train it!

The best test (and exercise to improve it), is to stand on one foot and close your eyes  - that forces you to pay attention to what your muscles are telling you. Try to work your way up to 60 seconds."
174,Right? I figured that her brother either has some serious balls or my ex found him doing something much worse and decided to just opt for a false swimming pool tale.
175,Not only are you both terrible at insults but you’re both too sensitive too receive them. Time to find a new game.
176,At least you didn't tell her deepest darkest secret to the entire internet to gain laughs and internet points!
177,"Thank you so much, this makes me feel better. I like the metaphor, as well."
178,Tifu by tripping myself...
179,"So i work with autistic ppl and that story is depainting autistic comportement with severe comportemental trouble. I heard way worse stories at my work place. He may have mental issues like paranioa too but I wouldnt be surprised if he's only autistic.

We always see kind autistic adult and cute kids that throw tantrums but Autism in adult can be pretty insane. Even more if the unadapted comportements arent culled early on. 

Where I work we (3 of us) had to maintain someone for 30 minutes  on the floor because he would attack the 1st person he saw as soon as he had a bit of free movement. And by attack I mean all out rage and will to kill. Because he wanted that plastic bag.  

And thats just one story. 

Anyway i vote for Autism in this case: emotional liability, rigidity (his highlither), personnal space issues and the fact that he wouldnt let the issue go. "

184,"Kids - please learn this lesson - getting in an insult battle with your SO is like playing chicken with your relationship status - if you lose it can be a crash and burn with no hope of recovery. I did this several times when I was young and dumb and it is one of the few things i regret because it just isn't necessary. Open up, be vulnerable, and share your love for each other honestly."
185,"If they're really going to make that much of a fuss over a highlighter and antagonize you, you should have gotten the police involved for the vandalism on your car. As well as the threats with the chainsaw."
186,"Actually we ended up having dinner, it was nice."
187,"she may be fine, but I would say to stay away from that brother and their family as much as possible. The danger of dating her means you might see her crazy brother again, so unless she's REALLY close to you and there's no way you can drop the relationships, I would leave her and stay FAR, FAAAAARRR away."
188,Get the strap 🤨🤨
189,"Taking her to dinner tn, hopefully lol"
190,"This shit happens man, but yeah insult games are always a bad idea. Even if it's in good spirits, subconsciously they could have a big effect and you might start wondering whether these jokey insults are rooted in reality or whatever. Terrible for self esteem even if you're thick skinned "
191,"I had a gf like this once. Funny jokes about each other and giggled all around. 

The next one was not so amused and it took numerous times of getting told off to remember not to do it!"
192,write a note in blue highlighter
193,Yeah but he'd be a legend if he did 
194,"Not gonna lie, this is exactly why I avoid ""yo mama"" jokes in any form unless I'm *absolutely* certain about the status of someone's mom."
195,"I don't mean to be rude, but please don't assume this is autism. This doesn't even resemble most people who have or their families. I completely agree that this person probably has some sort of mental condition and that is family is medically neglecting him by not getting him the help me needs. I also wonder what really happens to the ex gf. She is in a terrible situation."
196,Is anyone else a little weirded out how OP keeps mentioning the porn title and that his mom and sister are/were in sororities? 
197,Officer Doofy reporting for duty sir!
198,"If you saw how horribly the first highlighter gag gift went.....why would it make sense to you to go for it again, when things had escalated even more"

200,"""Talk to me like one of your French girls."""
201,Seriously file a police report for the chainsaw incident. And it seems you dodged a bullet with the girl if she puts her psychopathic  brother’s antics over your health.
202,"This is hilarious and super unfortunate xD

That’s really cute that you were so excited to help him. My gf tends to trip and lose her balance pretty frequently and I find it very charming and adorable/attractive for some reason, I’m sure he feels the same.

At least he knows you’d dash across the most slipperiest of ice for him, definitely got brownie points for that one "
203,"Is there any possibility your girlfriend’s family are super-controlling/abusive and this is heir method for scaring away boyfriends and retaining control over her?
If there’s any chance, it might be worth considering reporting the threat with a chainsaw to the cops and also reporting that you think there’s some sort of abuse going on..."
204,"My husband once very seriously asked me if I realized that I had pooped in the shower. Turns out it was the cat, he had diarrhea. It still cracks me up because he thought I might accidentally poop in the shower. "
205,"I can see it now. Part 3, TIFU by finding out my girlfriend hired actors to break up with me. "
206,Really tho. How do you make the same mistake twice in a row
207,Suicide by highlighter 🤔 sounds interesting.
208,"Shit, it's worth a try though, right?"
209,Generally joking about rape with a gf is a pretty easy way to find the line
210,"Pretty sure part 3 is when OP goes through his exes trash, finds the chewed up highlighter and fixes it with his highlighter repair skills. From there he will return and try to give it back to the brother. Then the family and the dog go to his house."
211,"I mean... There's a big difference between lighthearted teasing and, you know... Insulting somebody and calling it 'funny.'"
212,Almost like OP is using it as hyperbole to point out how boneheaded it was
213,And ones with acne convinced they somehow did it wrong
214,"You know what? This is probably legit. I wouldn't think twice about accidentally insulting someone I know who's generally mean but when it comes to someone who's always nice then I actually think twice about what I say and if I can't think of a way to phrase something in a nice way then I just keep my damn mouth shut.

The hardest part seems to be taking the first step!"
215,Tombstone will read.. it was just a yoke
216,"I was trading typical insults with a guy I knew in high school, long time ago, and used the typical ""I fucked your mom"" line and he petty much shut down. Learned from a fellow student that Mark's mom was dead...

Felt terrible, but honestly no way I would've known that. Still feel bad, twenty years after the fact. "
217,Son of you'd rather me smoke Marlboros just say the word
218,"Yeah... There is no way. You should ask why your gf didn't tell you her brother was mentally unstable and that is clearly has happened before. And that her parent's are also crazy.

If you get mixed in this family, you'll be always looking over your shoulders for crazy brother looking for his highlighter with a chainsaw."
219,"If you only have one data point, you don't know if 0 = more violent or &gt;1 = more violent. That's what he went to test. 

Next he should bring a crate to see if the violence intensity is a straight line or something else. "
220,"She does owe him an explanation. But it sounds like the better, safer option is just to let these nutjobs fade into his distant memories without any further contact."
221,"My wife and I have something like this.  If one of us is uncomfortable or we're starting to get to the argument zone in public one of us says ""Peaches"" and all conversation stops.  We usually hash it out in private once we're cooler headed.  Most of the time we laugh at how stupid it was.  Never fall asleep mad at each other."
222,"No ""can"", he was ready to murder OP."
223,*some men just want to see the world burn*
224,A great plot twist would be if he ran a DNA test on the highlighter and found out that the GF chewed it
225,... did you enjoy it
226,But not the cleaning tank. 
227,"Oh you double TIFUed that one.  Why the living fuck would you go and make yourself even look potentially guilty of something by going and getting a highlighter and trying to return it, you numpty?  Especially to a family that is clearly and completely fucked in the head?  

Run.  Run away now, do not try to contact your GF, block her number, get the hell out of there, stay away."

230,"Probably not. That's two pumps down while she has to wait on a licensed tech to come re-attach them and make sure they are working fine, all the while she'll have people bitching all day about why two of the pumps are down and they had to wait. "
231,"It can be really easy to sprain your ankle after you've done it once. You stretch the ligaments so that they no longer support the ankle enough. There are exercises you can do that will reduce the risk of this happening again, look them up and/or talk to a PT."
232,Next week on r/teenagers
233,Yeah guys! Lets drive the kid even more nuts!
234,My boyfriend’s parents told him he was a mistake when he was 5. Some parents are just terrible I guess. 
235,"you know what, thats actually a fair point. "

240,"*Mission failed, we'll get 'em next time*"
241,"Yeah, if the brother is in high school and behaving like this, something might be wrong. And the fact that the parents believe their son who apparently has behavioral or mental limitations rather than commonsense tells me something might be wrong with the whole family. "
242,"I'm hard being on top *and* bottom

243,I wouldnt be surprised if he abused the dog fpr messing with his precious lighter
244,Um... I’m glad you found a nice middle ground.

And Ted found himself in a quandary,  

Left atop a large pile of dark laundry.

&amp;#x200B;

So Ted lay and pondered his future,  

Which looked very much like demise.  

But out of sheer luck, he became quite unstuck,  

For Ted, that was quite a surprise.

252,"Yeah like this shit sounds made up and the fact that it somehow makes it to the front page shows how gullible people really are: 

You get threatened with a chainsaw so you come back for more? Either OPs lying or is mentally inept"
253,"Welcome to Bible Belt, USA."
254,Have one that replaces ‘Millennials’ with ‘Snake People’
255,"Not a good thing to find out when you're 5. 

When you're in your late 20s and your parents let slip you were an unplanned pregnancy it's like, oh fair enough, cos they've already loved you for 2 decades."
256,I really thought this was a throwaway account
257,"Well, in his mind, things were different now that the family concretely knew that it wasn’t his fault.
But even then, it was the family’s responsibility to apologize. If they didn’t say some shred of rationality and apologize (or atleast tell the gf to apologize for them), then they are defiantly not the kind of people that you want to be poking again. If they DID apologize, then go ahead with your highlighter salesman routine.

Aside from OP’s Ex’s family, even his Ex didn’t really behave appropriately. If her family was putting him through all that shit, she should have been more apologetic. Not just “You’re banned from this house”, but in her shoes, me and I think most people would be like “I’m really sorry. My family is crazy. They banned you from the house. I tried to talk to them but there is no reasoning. It’s not a good idea for you to come. I feel really bad, I’m sorry.”
But she really didn’t appeal much to the fact that OP was being mistreated and misaccused. Glad she’s an ex already."
258,"Wait, just for clarification, you're speaking like this happened very recently but the brother was found d swimming in the neighbors pool? In Boulder, CO... in January?"
259,How did I miss that? 
260,"""Neither of us wear our hearts on our sleeves, we don't get butthurt""

You guys aren't very good at this game lmao"
261,"Definitely bother with a police report about the eggs thrown at you though, that's assault. The chainsaw is just threatening murder. The assault plus threatening might result in the kid seeing jail time though. "
262,"Yeah I immediately thought that the younger brother has autism. A very extreme level of autism with challenging behaviour. 

Which is also probably why the parents immediately sided with the brother. With they've had to manage extreme behaviours all that kid's life, then they've probably figured the easiest way to deal with it was to go along with the kid. I've worked with parents like that before; never teach the autistic child correct boundaries and their challenging behaviours just get worse and worse until they can't unlearn them. "
263,"Reminds me when an ex and I were showering together. Had dyed my hair the day before, so when my hair got wet, some of the dye started to go down the drain. Not really paying attention or caring, meanwhile, he is standing far away from the drain as humanly possible. Ask him if he's alright and he just points to the dye. Started busting a gut because he thought I was on my period. "
264,and eggs
265,These puns are eggscellent.
266,Am I the only one confused about being grounded at the age of 20???

268,Now you know how the Germans felt during WW1
269,"Please keep us in the loop with what happens at this meeting. You really shouldn't be fired for this especially when you apologize for it. Moreover, at least this was to your boss and not a client. "
270,"One time a gas pump didn’t auto-shut off and spewed gas all over my car, the ground, and my body. I shut it off as fast as I could and went inside to tell the cashier. He told me he didn’t know what I wanted from him and to get out of his line unless I was going to buy something. 

I just left. I wonder how many more people it happened to that day. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ "
271,"Aight, I'll be that guy. No way this is real."
272,I keep thinking it would be funny to just randomly leave a box of eggs and a single highlighter on the front doorstep every now and then. 
273,What state are you in? That will help explain the level of garbage these people are and why
274,"OP's not an idiot, but they should apologize.

This is a mistake you learn to avoid by making it once and only once.  Let your partner win the insult game.  If they win, you both win.  If you win, you both lose."
275,Nightman?
276,I also typed all this into WebMD and apparently you have cancer as well? 
277,If we could verify the legitimacy of the OP we could all chip in and send a few thousand boxes...
278,This story is like the worst told lie I ever heard. Nothing makes any sense and I can't believe people are actually gullible enough to believe this sort of low effort fiction.
279,"For that reason you can give him a pass for the first time he tried to gift highlighters. Now he just did the same dumb thing that failed miserably last time AGAIN. If you give a guy a highlighter and he chases you off with a chainsaw, and you go back with more highlighters, thats on you. youre fully aware of the amount of crazy youre walking into"
280,"""well yeah a pregnancy scare with YOU you cute Lil monster!"""
281,This is the TLDR we needed
282,"Just start going around and insulting all the girls you see.  When one starts insulting you back you know you've got a keeper.

No, people, don't do that!  Sarcasm all the way baby."
283,"At least the line was clear for each. I had an ex who loved to hurl zingers at me, but the minute I reciprocate, I’m a mean person and he’s butthurt. "
284,Take her out every night for the next decade 
285,"from the way OP described it, it definitely seems like the parents are indeed empowering the kid to be violent, its easy to see why he thinks this is acceptable judging by how the other men in the family reacted to OP"
286,I rolled my eyes hard when he said neither of them get “butthurt.” Oh please. Life isn’t a competition to see who can become the least upset or offended at something. 
287,I would personally be really upset that your boss chose to humiliate you and leave you scraping by without exposing why! There should have been a mature discussion rather than a humiliation IMO. 
288,"New friends yeah, ditch them. Old friends however....well you're in the army now son"
289,"how do you get grounded at 20? You're an adult, just do what you want"
290,"I was on side for most of it, but I think he is leaving something out of the story. OP seems like on of those guys that thinks everything is funny when in reality its not. Who keeps going to someones house like that after being told they weren't welcome. And not even with real sincerity."
291,"Maybe because if this had been like, a normal family, they might have appreciated the gesture? This is not OP's fault. "
292,Hahahahahahaha op you should totally do this 
293,"What. The. Fuck. Lol
"
294,You're welcome. to answer your edit it's my favorite expression when something doesn't go to plan. Supposed to be an alt but I never made a main lol.
295,"Mf knew you hadn’t stolen his highlighter and you hook him up with a new one so he goes for the chainsaw? Tf you doing coming back with a whole box of chainsaws??? 😂😂😂 You’re lucky the kid didn’t come at you with a plethora of different of chainsaws.

In all seriousness, I’d just stay away and cut communication. It sounds like the whole family is fucked and you dodged a bullet.

Edit: a word"

297,Haha!! I use a red tinting conditioner and happened to splatter some on the shower curtain during my time.. hubby thought it was blood
298,"Yes, I don't know what's wrong with OP. The family clearly has multiple issues, but read the fucking room."
299,"Not well, they've since moved out."
300,"That's never a fun game.

Honestly, One thing I realized when I was younger was that words have power, and even if someone is joking, and even if it doesn't hurt my feelings, I didn't like being made fun of, or being called names. Again, even if the other person was just joking."
301,"I mean, if 1 = chainsaw, and 6-8(highlighter pack size?) = eggs, I feel like increasing highlighters decreases violence."
302,The parents are neglectful for not doing what’s needed to get their son some help and for forcing their daughter to live with it. This is abusive. 
303,"To be honest, if they knew it was the dog, now it would make sense to take the joke, not only that, they should have used the excuse to apologize to him, as they know he didn't do anything wrong."

324,"Oh damn. My parents did get me one, ""because I liked the one at my grandparents house so much"". How did I never realize that. "
325,"As a nanny, this is one of my worst fears. I’m in communication a lot with my bosses and I have definitely messed up texts before. 

 One time I sent a gif of Batman patting a bed and saying “let’s fuck here”... to my boyfriend. Or so I thought. But no, it was to his mother whom I had recently just met. I was mortified. I now delete all messages to and from her so there is never a conversation with her on my phone lol

326,"I wonder what went through his head...  ""Did she sneeze?!  Should I mention it?"""

What shitty people that they are so delusional and unwilling to take accountability for themselves and their shit family.

And just seconds after that, the front door opened and her brother began pelting me and my car with eggs. I got into my car and saw the dad trying to restrain him and I just drove off right as I saw the brother smash the eggs to the ground and run off into the small stretch of woods near their house. I drove off and temporarily stopped at a stop sign to get the egg out of my face and try to clean my clothes.

Just that this insane family wasn't worth the treatment. Holy crap, I wonder what kind of stunts that BPD/APD nutjob guy put other poor people on. The parents were most likely at fault for much of that. The kid's entirely mayhem. How isn't the narcissistic kid on meds yet? "

It was your classic kitchen banter where we all got a little rude and crass but it was always in good fun.  Well, one time during a back and forth I told one of the guys, ""At least my parents love me"" and it went DEAD QUIET.  The guy working next to him said ""You know he's adopted, right?""    


I did not know that.     


He was a great sport and we all laughed it off.  It still randomly gets brought up and we all share a good laugh at my expense.   Banter is fun and all but you never know if you've crossed the line until you're a mile past it."

It was down to me (\~80% of the map) and 2 other guys, one with 1 territory left, and 1 holding the remainder of the map, but disjointed and not controlling any continent/region for the bonuses. When I took out the one guys last territory, the guy with the remaining \~20% of the map convinced the guy who just got knocked out to flip the board. Never got to win that game.

414,"YES! That was another big rule of ours, as well as ""stay in the ring"", meaning don't walk away from a discussion until you've either worked it out, or decided that both of you need to come back to it later."
415,"Well, I think at this point the choice is either to leave a bad impression or get his brains blown out on their front porch. The choice seems pretty clear to me. OP needs to go back and try again. "
416,Have you been checked for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? 
417,"I'm confused at how you did this.

You put nozzle in and hold trigger to fill tank.  
When tank is full you out the nozzle back.

You're holding the handle the whole time so it's not like you forget it's there.

Or do you have some hands free nozzel?"
418,"The stay in the ring rule doesn’t work for everyone. If I’m getting upset or feeling cornered it is not a good idea for me to just try to get past it. It builds until I say something out of line. Where as five minutes away from the situation can really help me catch my breath and center myself so I can approach things more like an adult and less like an asshole.

I’m glad this rule works for you, but for others just be aware that some people need different things, and sometimes people can’t just “stay in the ring.”"

434,"This is much more likely to be a bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder. 

Most autistic people aren’t violent. They also tend to avoid confrontation, not escalate it. Labeling every out of control person autistic is a real hurdle for those of us who then have to prove that isn’t true. 10% of people are on the autism spectrum. You probably know someone who is and would never guess who. The first thing people said to me was, “What? No, you can’t be.” 

We’re odd sometimes but this isn’t a normal presentation of autism, unless he is also being abused or neglected. Even then, the abuse would be the cause of this behavior, not the autism. This happens a lot. Parents get overwhelmed with their autistic kid’s needs and neglect and verbal or physical abuse happens. The stereotypical depiction of the “screaming autistic” is the result of years of nobody attempting to communicate meaningfully and refusing to recognize valid issues like touch sensitivity and audio overload."

448,[removed]
449,"Exactly. The thing is, those parents are usually exhausted so its difficult for them to teach an autistic child. They dont change comportment pattern easily  and it can take years to modify one just slightly. Like you said, the older they are the more crystalized the comportment become till its just part of them. If i could talk to the parents id tell them to get help from specialists asap. He probably needs medication too just to reduce the level of aggression. "

456,"No worries, I don't mind. When I was a kid, I had recurring nightmares that I was standing in the middle of so many fish which are flipping on the ground and unable to breathe. I am unable to save them because there are so many of them and I found them slimy / gross to touch, and because of that I had to watch them die. 

Funnily, before this all happened, I wanted to have a fish tank and my parents were reluctant to get one. They said I can have it if I promise that I clean it myself. I did, and my dad took me to the fish store to get me a fish tank. I happened to watch the employee clean a tank and changed my mind and noped out. 

Also, one time, our neighborhood got flooded due to the rain. It must've brought fish eggs / baby fish from the river. There were so many fish swimming in the puddles and other folks were catching them. I made my dad come with me to catch some. We got some in a bucket of water and put them in our well (as we don't know what else to do with them). 

Not sure which one of these inspired my nightmares, but I've not been getting them lately. But I still remember them when I see fish, so avoid them for good measure. I've not really thought about their eyes. Thank you for a new item for consideration... I've not talked to anyone about this in a long time, sorry if this was too much of a ramble."

489,"Yeah... you’re going to get ROASTED by her family.

But here’s the thing. How YOU react to that roasting, will determine whether this is a fuck up which ends your relationship... or a funny story they tell at your wedding.

If you go downstairs, take it like a champ and laugh it all off, they’ll think better of you, for being a good sport.

If you act like a dick, try to shift blame, try to deny what you said, etc, there’s a good chance that this will all backfire, and you come out of it looking like an ass.

So, in short, unless you spent the evening talking about your love of pegging, or discussing if you should bring the family dog into your next message session, they probably didn’t hear anything TOO bad.  So take your lumps, and wait for the storm to blow over.  This could even IMPROVE your relationship with your special lady."
