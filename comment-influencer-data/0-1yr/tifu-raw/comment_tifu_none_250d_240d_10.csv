7,"This requires a lot of extra input on your post. Minors cannot be randomly drug-tested, or to self-incriminate themselves. That's part of the fourth and fifth amendments to the Constitution unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination.

So the question is why do you think they can do either. If it's because they say so then they're wrong. If it's a matter of you maintaining a space on a sports team or some other activity which you've already agreed to, there might be some grounds for testing, but again it all comes down to your 4th and 5th Amendment rights. And I'm assuming you live in the United States"

If nothing else they'd be bringing a needed product to market. I love Lush but everything they make is 92% glitter.

18,"Distasteful jokes are dad area, when I was kid long time ago when internet was new thing  (dialup!) I had my mates over we had few tabs of cars open so we could claim innocence and tabs of porn.

Cars you say?"" So his running dad joke for next 5 years was ""cars"" related like ""erase history after watching cars at night"" ""oh my son favourite hobby is watching car pictures on internet"" ""flush the tissues after you end your car watching session""...

20,I‚Äôm too broke to give you gold but that was fuckin‚Äô hilarious
21,"If it helps, maybe it was never broken and she wanted you to see it."
22,"Okay. I think you should find a pendant or earrings to match the ring, then mold a lookalike in marzipan (you can usually find it in the international foods/German section, or baking supplies.)  Cake decorating supplies may help. They have edible gold spray, etc. 
 

Then...while gifting the item's gift box, grab the lookalike from it, and GULP.  An evil laugh should then be emitted, as you hand over the actual jewelry.

Tell your sis this made me smile and right now that is VERY hard to do. Thank you for telling the story.  You deserve the upvote."

71,"Uh yeah you literally said in your post

&gt;my siblings were abused as well.

And

&gt;I do not feel that my brother's in any way at risk of being abused

So which is it?  If your brother was/is abused, it *should* be reported. If he wasn't/isn't, you should call your therapist and clarify. 

"
72,Well my balls aren‚Äôt gonna come back down for a while now. Hope your bf is feeling better!
73,"Deodorant masks the smell and or has some antibiotic properties to kill the bacteria that produces the bad smell.

Antiperspirant contains a salt that complexes with the water in perspiration to make it unavailable to said bacteria.

""Natural"" products either contain the raw form of the salt or don't contain it all.  If it says ""Antiperspirant"" it has to contain the salt and list how much active ingredient there is.

The most effective kinds are roll-on, because they have better bioavailability.  The least effective are solid sticks, but they tend to be the mildest.  Even after showering you can skip a day as it takes a few days to wash out the salt.  So try one that's comfortable for you and just using deodorant in-between days.

In the business."

83,I'm just glad everything came out okay.
84,lol as soon as I read the TIFU I thought of ADHD impulsivity. I've done stupid shit like this before and then found myself having to explain something I just couldn't.

90,Impulsivity is a bitch aint it. I feel you OP
91,"There you go again mentioning once again how you do things right and OP messed up. The sub is to laugh, and maybe point out things the OP did wrong. But when they themselves, in their original post, describe that they were wrong, have learned their lesson and will now correct their behavior. Its kind of useless to come in here and chime in with ""well you're a bad pet owner you should obviously do (thing OP clearly already outlined to do in the future)."" It makes you look ridiculous, and when you got called out you doubled down. There is also a difference between making fun of OP and their mistake and dickish behavior. You expressed the latter. There is difference between someone jokingly saying a joke such as ""Hey OP what are you gonna do next? Feed chocolate to your dog?"" Which is clearly a joke. And then theres your totally unnecesary comment that repeatedly lists OPs errors unnecessarily and tells them theyre a bad pet owner then tell them what to do. When they clearly know now what not to do without you or your non-humoristic babble that tou perceive as helpful. Have a great day dude. "
92,That would be r/recursiveincest
93,"Wtf how is this a problem, I don't understand, there's literally NOTHING wrong, no damage has been done, you didn't know, it's ok, you're really being extremely over dramatic, and it's a shame you and her just left like this without talking to eachother..."
94,Ur dumb as fuck lmao
95,"I actually raised the point that, had the roles been reversed, I would've been maybe offended, but open to talking about it. She said that might be so, but I hadn't been cheated on so I couldn't know how that felt.

111,"I had parked at a designated long term parking (so not near terminal but 7 minute bus ride away) in Melbourne Australia, for 32 days and it ended up costing $AU300. I can‚Äôt imagine airport parking in a US ‚Äúflyover‚Äù state to cost more than double that!"
112,"Big city here, yeah, it you park in some shitty lot that's 3 miles away, and get bussed to the airport, it's about as low as like $5.99...but then there is multiple fees, and they do hourly rates up to $5.99 daily, so what you call a 4 day trip, they call a 5, and with fees, you owe $41....when you were thinking 6x4=24.

On property is a LOT worse.  I often fly out of a smaller airport with absolutely no cheap parking near the airport.  $14 a day it is.  My 5 day trips are billed as 6, and there goes $84."

118,"Exactly, stealing time is illegal and that's what this guys main job is apparently. Sounds like a lazy piece of shit to me. "
119,"Don't mean to rub salt in the wound, but it sounds like maybe you just learned a valuable life lesson. Don't EVER assume the price of something, especially when it's some kind of service.

173,"Very well put. I agree with your reasoning completely. I'm 47 and self employed. I understand that no one would care about the quality of my jobs as much as I do. It's ultimately my responsibility to make sure my jobs come out perfect and are safe. It's electricity so there can't be any mistakes. I learned from my Dad who was meticulous too. There are so many things to learn in this business, and some of those things are complex, but the last 7-8 guys I've employed can't even grasp or remember the ridiculously easy stuff, like ""don't touch the sheetrock when you install switches. You'll leave fingerprints"", or ""Don't scratch the door frames when you bring a ladder in the house"". You have to tell them stuff like that every single time. Forget about teaching them how to make solid connections and how to wire 3way and 4way switches. They don't want to even know. They just ask me to do it. That's ridiculous and frustrating. These guys think they should earn $30 per hour too. They are very efficient at taking days off or looking for a raise though. My guys work about 40 hours a week, while I usually put in 80, and if a job is running a little late or I ask if they'd like to work on a Saturday for time and a half, the answer is usually no. Zero initiative. Either I'm on a 10 year stroke of really bad luck or the whole generation has changed drastically. "
174,"the good news is ""B"" played herself by calling the cops. Get a copy of that police report and make sure it includes everything.

193,"Yes, next time make sure you sign a lease and keep a copy of it for yourself. Lesson learned. Best to be looking for a new home. "
194,Honestly with this new gig economy I‚Äôd say some Americans work harder and longer than those in most other highly developed countries.
195,We need those cat photos
196,"That's still a threat, my dude. If I fully intend to turn off the TV if my roommate keeps watching Bob's Burgers, and I really do plan to do that, but then I tell that to my roommate to convince her to stop watching Bob's Burgers, I have threatened her with that action to force her to behave the way I want her to.

A healthier action, in your case, would be to talk honestly about your depression with a professional. I get the impression you're not being honest enough with your therapist if you're experiencing suicidal ideation and you're not getting specific treatment for that. Either that or it may be time to see a therapist who takes your problems more seriously."
197,My apartment is just quite small and yeah I'm just struggling to figure this out
198,Thus proving she is in fact a lunatic 
199,"Hahaha that's exactly how we reacted. We immediately exited online mode and went right the fuck back to story mode lmao.

And yea, i knew we had this thing attached to our TV but my dumb ass always thought it was a receiver for the remote or something. Which I ignored, because my lazy ass installed an app on my phone to control the TV via wifi, because there are two seperate (very tiny) remotes to control the TV and the volume on the sound bar, and i wanted a universal one. 

I feel like I probably pushed it back there when I was windex-ing the glass top on the TV table and forgot about it because no one ever uses it. Found it and was like oh shit, that's a camera. Lmao "

213,"My mum has lost her engagement ring in the move we made down from New England to Florida. The house here has been under serious renovation so most of our stuff was packed into one room. With arthritis, a couple surgeries, and other health problems causing weight fluctuation, she hadn't been wearing it. I guess a few boxes were moved in that room and her jewelry box fell? We've since unpacked EVERYTHING, looked in every box, and the ring is gone. 
As she says, yeah it's a ring, it's a material object, but it still hurts. We suspect one of the many builders or laborers we had in may have found it, but I don't see how. Either way, as of right now, it's gone. 
I also know the panic of realising your necklace is gone days later. Mine was kinda cheap but it was a symbol of my boyfriend's love, especially since we live so far apart, and my heart broke at that moment. I did find it again, but I know exactly how you feel. It's not so much the THING no matter how beautiful and expensive something may be, it was the love behind it. My heart goes out to you. "

If they are asking for help to pay for basic necessities in a shopping line, it's probably not the right time to offer a detailed financial plan.  Sometimes you just gotta give a hand.  But I get your point.  There are immediate needs, then ways to help long term needs.

Have a good one."

225,Ikr eww
226,Reminds me of why my dad's ex girlfriend got drunk and started screeching about how the military is all brainwashed drones.  It was over that night.
227,"I really hate that feature on iPhones. I literally called 911 by accident three days ago because of it. Was just fiddling with my phone in my hand and looked down and saw 911, so I panicked and hung up. They called me back twice and my paranoid brain was freaking out. Luckily the 911 operator just left a voicemail saying to call again if I needed the police or paramedics and to disregard the message if I didn‚Äôt. "

After I hung up with the school the lowest level HQ rep said she would catch me up later with any actions I had and to tell my daughter hi.

Your car was probably going 20mph or less looking at the damage. Any faster you likely would have gone through the windshield. 

Hope your face feels better, always buckle up. My parents made it a rule to be buckled before the car moves, I follow the same rules. "
353,Like I said in the beginning of the post this happened a year ago. Since then things have gotten much better. It's something funny to look back on now and include the short version in meetings when I speak lmao. But yea at the moment is was one of the actual dumbest things I have ever done.

355,You slipped out of the room in the time that it took your mom to tuck in your brother without being noticed? You ninja you
356,This is VERY comforting! I was considering making a Drs appointment for my apparent insanity
357,"The movies vary wildly in quality - for the original series and Next Generation, even-numbered movies are better than odd.

For the Chris Pine movies, I enjoyed the first one (Star Trek 2009) and the third one, Beyond, but thought Into Darkness sucked. I'd definitely recommend that you watch the 2009 movie - the opening 15 minutes alone is worth the price of rental, and since you've seen Enterprise, there's a cute reference to Archer that you'll catch. 

For the series, season 1 and even parts of season 2 of The Next Generation are pretty terrible; in general, the first 2 seasons of any post-original-series Star Trek are always weakest. I'd personally recommend skipping a bunch of early S1/S2 TNG, but other fans would tell you to watch it all. (Voyager probably has the strongest season 1, but never gets as good as TNG or DS9. DS9 is my personal favorite.)"
358,Lmaoo thatd be a twist
359,Unless you know exactly where they‚Äôre buried...
360,"Weeks ago I fucked up
WAIFU"
361,Throw the kids in jail then. Both sender and receiver. Gotta keep those record high carceral numbers up!
362,"You would think so.  At my current company, we have a biweekly meeting.  The higher ups congregate in a meeting room and everyone else dials in.

It is highly sensitive company info, but there is no authentication.  Anyone who misdials and gets that number by chance is also in on the meeting.

The higher ups can hear each other just fine.  They feel no pressure to talk into the mike.  When someone remote is speaking, I hear them fine, but when a higher up is talking it is just so much blah, blah, blah.

The meeting software does not allow the higher ups to control the mute.  So there is a fair amount of ""If you're not presenting, can you please mute."""
363,This happened to me too when I was about the same age but my mom and dad back then had a waterbed that had a over hang edge. I knew if I had crawled into bed with them they would have sent be back into my own bed and I liked laying under the over hang and crawled down there and fell asleep. I was awoken by panicked shuffling and lights all over the house being turned on and my mom on the phone talking to someone probably the police. I remember crawling out and did not understand all the excitement and their panic. 
364,"If anything, this scenario would be much worse as a full-fledged ""adult"". Point being, you'd have to stop living together and find a new place, buy new furniture, if there's a marriage and kids involved..well that's a whole different story! This kid got lucky (much like I did when I was cheated on in highschool) in the fact that he doesn't have to waste anymore of his time with someone who doesn't want to be with him."
365,"I apologize in advance, but if you're that impaired how is using a computer easier than paper? Do you have the computer read the screen out to you?"
366,Yeeees!!
367,See my answer to u/fiddlerontheroof1925
368,Gabby the real mvp
369,"I dated a girl for 7 years and found out she was cheating on me with my best friend.  All my friends knew because he was all their friend as well.  

I drove to his house and he lied.  I punched him in the face, left and was no longer friends with anyone who decided that it was better for my friends group if I didn‚Äôt find out.

It all worked out for the better."
370,Why did they start looking? Was it because your other friends thought they'd lost her?
371,"Im not used to measures of KPM, so I googled the average, of which you seem to type double of. I type quite fast, but cannot do a measurement as I'm on mobile.  My main takeaway is, the average typing speed is slow... an average that you seem to blow out of the water, eyesight be damned."
372,"Thank you!

374,"This one time in Mexico, they found the body of a missing child wedged between the mattress and the bed-frame 8 days later. Her parents had given interviews like right in front of the bed while the search for her was underway. Horrible incident.

375,"This is my worst fear, im glad you did it in the best way, good for her that now her parents know what she does. i had a friend who we were on and off with (not sexual) but after a while she kept jumping to my friends and her parents were so nice. so i saw the mom and dad and they were like how come you dont hang out with our daughter anymore? we miss you. but i didnt have the guts to say shes jumping around guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good job u got out of a bad relationship"
376,"Are you having a good hair day now?

Cause that sounded like a bad hair day."
377,"Gaby is a bro dude, hope you're doing better now, know what it feels like"
378,I think I'd blocked it from my memory until I read your post hahahaha
379,The door is over there. Take my upvote whilst you're at it.
380,"My nephew once fell asleep under his crib in a nest of stuffed animals. After not being able to find him anywhere, my sister also freaked out and called the cops. One of the officers found him and shouted ""got a body!"" My sister said that hearing those words is the worst feeling she has ever had in her life. So...your family was spared that particular trauma."
381,You drove 2 miles to use a gym. Why not walk the 4 miles there and back and save on the membership?
382,How did your mom know what you said to your teacher?... Unless there was hard feelings from your teacher and she lied about it
383,This is why the premise of home alone is believable.
384,"Thank you, I am thinking about what you said.  It's good advice in knowing when to pick your battles.  In rethinking the situation I mostly agree with you that the easiest thing was to just deal with him first because he probably would've gotten belligerent.  "
385,"This is false. Some jurisdictions will look right away depending on the person and circumstances. We have silver alerts for instance for older people and it‚Äôs as quick as amber alerts. It‚Äôs best to always call right away if it‚Äôs obvious a person is missing in foul play, the police and detectives can sort out how fast they want to act. "
386,"That's not true. 

- I work with the missing persons clearing house in the US"
387,"I don‚Äôt think you fucked up, there is nothing wrong with in trying to see the best in people. It will hurt and be shit for a while but eventually you will get over it, and look back at how it has made you stronger and more aware of people. 

I know because something similar happened to me once, nothing hurts more than betrayal. But best of luck for the rest of your life and remember, you‚Äôre only 17, you won‚Äôt care about this at all in the future, it only hurts because it is recent."
388,"You don't have to wait 24hours to report someone missing. Adults obviously have free will to just leave unlike kids, but if they're life is going good and they have a routine and then just randomly disappear it's still suspicious of something happening
"
389,‚ÄúYou cheated on me? When I specifically asked you not to?‚Äù
390,People that fall for this blackmail bs are seriously stupid. Who the fuck cares? And you look twelve in the screenshot 
391,Is this comment implying that you are actually fucking with us because you are actually gay?
392,Idk man. Looks can be deceiving
393,This sounds like a website from Arrested Development.
394,"As a fellow Gay, that's gay code for ""damn, I wish he was gay. I'll wait until he is drunk and feeling bi curious"""
395,"Kinda sucks, you are really cute! We'd love to have you batting for our team, anyday!"
396,"Maybe, maybe not, we'll never know for sure! 

Thank you!"
397,Small claims court?
398,"So much this. I know from personal experience that parents like this don‚Äôt stop. This is why when I got a job that make 42k a year, I told my mom I was making $9 an hour. "
399,I guarantee if you would of bought a pewdiepie chair this wouldn‚Äôt of happened 
400,"""These are real, by the way..."""
401,Hope OP read this
402,"This and change your addresses! I had to make sure all my addresses were changed and had to threaten my mom with reporting her to the feds for opening up my mail. 

I had been freaking out for two weeks thinking that they were doing more testing on a biopsy I had gotten and she was why I hadn‚Äôt heard anything. When I found the opened letters on her bedside table I threatened pressing charges. Bitch never told me I came back negative for cancer. I was then attacked for not being a good daughter for wanting to report her, but it‚Äôs a federal offense to open up mail that doesn‚Äôt belong to you."
403,Have you considered returning the fianc√©e instead?
404,Need to pin your post to r/suddenlygay 
405,r/meatgazer
406,"Okay, there is a difference between dipping into the kids college fund for their birthday and stealing their student loan to fund incompetence.

&gt;You wouldn't hold it against a two year old for spilling grape juice on the carpet, so why would I or the OP hold it against the parents?

A two year old is still developing. Adults are fully developed, so if they are pieces of shit then you should absolutely hold it against them. Why would you treat a moral human being the same as an immoral one?"
407,"Addicts. Scumbags. My dad wiped both mine and my brother's accounts, and my mums, multiple times to finance his gambling habit."
408,ur my hero
409,At least OP will get to grab Jessica Biel's boobs.
410,Your honor.....we find the defendant....a moron!
411,No it doesn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre grown ups. They should know how to make what sacrifices / lifestyle changes need to be made to keep what they have. 
412,Congrats on coming out on not being gay. 
413,It's the Double Slit Experiment: They're gay depending on whether or not you observe them.
414,"To make this more hilarious, most people I know that went from a catholic school ended up being, like, SUPER gay."
415,You guys do lose very few players.
416,"Maybe just hijacked the top thread to get his point? That said a valid, thoughtful and funny point so I dont mind in the slightest. "
