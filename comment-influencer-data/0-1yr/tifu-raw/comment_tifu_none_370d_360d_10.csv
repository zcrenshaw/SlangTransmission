10,"Listen to me.  LISTEN! 

If you get it replaced, there is an option to get a brace that prevents the knee from extending in such a way to tear the new one before it is healed.  It will take several months to heal fully.  GET THAT BRACE AND WEAR IT WHENEVER YOU AREN'T SHOWERING.  Also, consider a shower chair so you are less likely to slip and re tear it. 

When you think it's healed, you have about another 6  months.  I got mine replaced,  then retore it. Now I have a shitty knee that is weak and aches ALL THE TIME. 

Wear your brace. I'd say for a year,  just to make really, truly, 100% sure the graft is healed.

EDIT: Not sure if I had the same brace as other folks. Mine was just to prevent the knee from snapping backwards or out to the side and retearing the ACL. "
11,"I didn‚Äôt select ‚Äúanonymous upload‚Äù when I uploaded the documents, so every document said ‚ÄúUploaded by: my name‚Äù.

12,TIL I learned that a BDSM contract is a thing.
13,"I've got one for you. I used to work as a federal officer for a while before deciding to pursue medicine and I had one funny domestic call one night. I had just gotten myself situated in my car when we got a call about some screaming coming from the apartment below them so we head over the check out. I parked at the end of the street and walked up and I could tell a window was open somewhere because I could hear a man shouting at a woman calling her names. This makes me think there's a guy actively beating his spouse inside so I charge up to the door and give it the loudest authoritative knock I can and identify myself as the police. No response. I try to make my way around back to see if I can identify where the yelling was coming from when I hear a women saying something to the affect of ""fuck me sergeant!"" I embarrassingly realize what is actually happening and knock on the window and tell them to put on clothes and meet me out front. I apologize for breaking up their activities but let them know they left a window open and their neighbors called in a possible domestic dispute. While verifying their information I realize this ""sergeant"" is a E-2 private. He was stationed there for a few more years until I left and every time I'd pass him in the food court or somewhere I'd always say with a laugh ""How's it going sergeant?"". It was funny watching him turn beet red in public but he was a good sport about it all."
14,"Ironically, one reason to have one is if the police show up. But we expected the neighbors to call the police, not my watch. "

18,How did they even find out it was you? Did you leave your name on the documents or have your real name on your account?
19,Seems what a drug dealer would write on his door.
20,All while the friend kicks back and enjoys pizza with a show.
21,"Honestly, I'm thrilled about how the cops handled that though, and 911 too. They sent someone anyways, they separated you both to talk, they made sure you were safe. At least you know that if you had been in a terrible situation they would have intervened."
22,"**""DO NOT. THROW TOYS. AT YOUR SON!""**

23,"&gt;So both my girlfriend and I are deaf.

&gt;I start calling her name and don't get any response....

Well...uh...*yeah*...  :D"
24,"Oh holy shit I forgot to add that I had to delete the document off the website and only way doing so was to refund the company that paid me. 

Overall I had no gain whatsoever, only A LOT of stress."
25,"Make sure the title on the card is ""Shit Happens""."
26,"&gt;Once I finish my drink, though, he notices and asks if I'd like to go to a bar and get a drink. I'm a total homebody who doesn't do things like go to bars with strange men, so I decline, but eventually he persuades me to move to an outdoor table at a street-side cafe. Ok, I think, I've got plenty of time before my boyfriend gets here. I'll have one soda pop and then excuse myself.

Not taking ""no"" for an answer. Big red flag. 

&gt; As soon as the waitress comes over, before I can open my mouth, the guy orders two beers- one for each of us. Still, two drinks isn't much.

Forced teaming, ""*we're* both drinking/you gonna make me drink alone?/etc"". Another red flag.

&gt;After we finish the beers, he starts complaining that the cafe isn't showing the world cup game, even though Germany was playing that night. I should have excused myself then, but he convinced me to move out of the main square to a side street and to sit down at another outdoor cafe where we can see a TV screen.

More forced teaming, ""*we're* in this together, *we're* facing an obstacle"" kind of talk. 

&gt;He pays the tab and we start walking down the side street. 

Paying the tab unsolicited is sometimes a form of ""loan sharking"", and if you had stayed longer he probably would have referenced it as a reason you ""owe"" him whatever he was looking for.

You were absolutely right to get sketched out and leave, and you probably avoided having something very bad happen to you. But, you've correctly identified that you ignored your intuition because you were afraid of being impolite. His behavior was a steady march of obvious [pre-incident indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gift_of_Fear) that you were tuning out because you are socialized to be agreeable. Think about how things would have gone if you knew some of those indicators ahead of time, and knew the importance of prioritizing your intuition. 

IMO a very important takeaway from your story is that his nefarious intentions were telegraphed from the beginning, and repeatedly signaled over the course of the time you were interacting with him. Everyone, but especially young women who are going to travel in strange places, should know some basic warning signs ahead of time."

Learning how to defend, learning how to say ‚Äúno‚Äù and learning to say ‚Äúfuck being polite‚Äù are learned behaviours that don‚Äôt come easy. Usually it takes an incident like this one to make us realize the importance of defensive behaviour. This was your time to learn, and you did. Good for you.

50,"Hey, guess what? You went into shock! Your body thought you were gravely wounded and bleeding out, so it plummeted your blood pressure (which gives some people intense nausea) in an effort to slow your death! Sounds like you need to find another donation center because everything they did (making you stand up at all, blowing out your vein, telling you to down a gatorade, waiting to put you on an IV, etc) makes me think they didn't know what they were doing. Glad you're ok."

52,"""I lose my footing and I swear my soul leaves my body for a second. I rejoice, for mortal problems do not affect the dead.""

53,"Kind of similar story:

My 15yo sister got up from the toilet and was mortified, it was all red in there, bloodred. I can't even begin to imagine, what she must have thought in that instant, but she gathered some courage and went slowly, shaking, to mom, told her about it. Mom was rather calm, because my sis said that it wasn't red when she wiped, so there should be no reason to be afraid.

Later that night, when dad went to sleep after working almost all day in the garage, mom told him about what happened.

My dad started laughing, because he poured a bucket full of beetroot juice in the toilet that day. And he just didn't flush, as that would have been wasteful.

I just love to imagine my poor sister's reaction, because it is such a harmless story in the end."
54,"A female coworker went to Budapest and almost got kidnapped in a sketchy hostel. She had lots of red flags before she ended up in there. When she was telling us the story I couldn't believe how naive she was, it was so obvious that something wasn't right there but apparently some people can't see it for some reason. I've told all the women I can her story just in case someone thinks like her. Red flags she missed: finding a incredibly cheap hostel online that didn't have any kind of reviews (and she didn't bother to investigate more). The hostel wasn't in a touristy area. The ""hostel"" did not even have a sign outside. The lady who opened the door was topless and weird. The lady barely spoke English and the place looked more like a sex trafficking brothel. When she asked questions the lady didn't answer. And finally, there was a room full of drugged women laying on the floor and THEN is when she realized maybe something wasn't right. But by that time, she was already locked up inside and it was just by chance that she managed to escape when some guy opened the door. She reported it to the police and they said they knew about it but the mafia was too strong to do anything. Wtf."

71,Right???!
72,"Pretty much, yes. The contract is basically just to convince other people that the activity is consensual.

*Edit: or you just get off at the prospect of the contract.*

If you think you need a paper contract because you're concerned the other person will breach the bounds of what you're comfortable with, you've either got communication issues, or S.O.-selection issues

75,I dunno. A woman going into labor in front of u can be a bit of a shock. Don't think anyone will want an explanation. They'll just want to know ur ok
76,I don‚Äôt understand at all why you‚Äôre in trouble? You uploaded old notes and exam stuff online. Can you explain why you‚Äôre in so much trouble for doing that?
77,"Don‚Äôt feel too bad... I‚Äôm a 24 year old woman and I wouldn‚Äôt have known what to do either. 

Additionally, this reminded me of the time I got hit by a car on my college campus. I was crossing the street and a lady hit me with her Lexus. I‚Äôm on the ground with a broken wrist and head injury, but surprisingly alert because adrenaline is a sweet sweet drug. I jump up to get out of the street. She pulls her car into the grass next to me (which could have hit another student but ok). She gets out. I ask her to call 911. She hugs me. She‚Äôs clearly freaking out. I repeatedly ask her to call 911 to no avail so I push her off of me and a construction worker runs over and calls 911. Then THE WOMAN WHO HIT ME PASSES OUT. So there‚Äôs a crowd of students and construction workers forming and, just to be dramatic I guess, someone yells, ‚ÄúWe need another ambulance!‚Äù I‚Äôm in a great deal of pain at this point, so I ask someone who happened to be near me, ‚ÄúDo I still get the first ambulance?‚Äù

And that‚Äôs my story of two ambulances. I guess this is more common than I thought. "

86,"LISTEN TO ME! I completely tore my ACL, MCL, partially tore my PCL and Meniscus. All at 36. I‚Äôve been a very athletic person my entire life. My knee is now better than the non tore one, and I was back playing competing sports agains guys 15 years younger within a year. The key: GET A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC DOCTOR AND PT STAFF WHO WORK TOGETHER. I worked with a doctor and staff who work with an NHL team. Their job is to get a person back to 100% athletic capacity, mentally and physically, ASAP. A general doctors job is to get you walking through Fred Meyers comfortably. That is a huge difference. "
87,"Even better: don't hand in the paper to your uni, instead give them the link where they can buy it."
88,"Thing is, if you're on the receiving end of such surveys, it's often very easy to tell who wrote what by the content of the message. So make sure the content is vague, don't share specific anecdotes (sounds obvious but I've seen it happen), etc.

Not that this excuses what the professor did, mind you. That's completely fucking reprehensible."
89,"An Indian guy approached me in Frankfurt and would NOT take no for an answer. Started with ""hi, can I practice my English with you?"" followed by 5 minutes of polite conversation, an hour of me trying to politely get him to fuck off, him insisting he go back to my hostel with me ""for a drink"", me obviously refusing and making sure not to mention which hostel I was at, and eventually I went in to the train station and hid in the ladies' until he left. Fucking hell. He was just a creep though, not a human trafficker.

I feel truly awful about it but I'm wary of South Asian guys because I have had them follow me to my front door down my long driveway to ask for my number (and ask again after I said no), follow me down the street and into my apartment building (got off at the wrong floor intentionally, he *followed me* so I shouted at him in the stairwell until he ran away), surround me and not let me leave until I told them what country I was from and my (fake because duh) name. No strange men from any other culture have been so aggressive and persistent in their creepiness to me. "
90,Your kid‚Äôs name is Zandipus?

112,"Violates student conduct policy, you‚Äôre not supposed to share notes or exam information in certain ways. Students do share notes but uploading it like this got them busted. 

Edited to add: To be specific, here is the policy where I teach, a large research university in the US: 

‚ÄúAppropriate Student Use of Class Notes and Course Materials:

Taking notes is a means of recording information but more importantly of personally absorbing and integrating the educational experience. However, broadly disseminating class notes beyond the classroom community or accepting compensation for taking and distributing classroom notes undermines instructor interests in their intellectual work product while not substantially furthering instructor and student interests in effective learning. Such actions violate shared norms and standards of the academic community. ‚Äú"

2.  If you say no (even if you are a south Asian woman), you are playing hard to get.  The trick is to start screaming and humiliating them.  Like so ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have shame talking to a woman while she is along‚Äù or don‚Äôt even answer and pretend they are not their.  I am serious about this.  

3.  They are uneducated and can‚Äôt deal with themselves.   I love being south asian, but this aspect of my culture is down right wrong.  If they are from India, then there should be a strong sense of worship towards women. If Pakistani than idk, but it‚Äôs not correct. No means no and these idiots don‚Äôt think it matters. In India you wouldn‚Äôt even talk to these guys or acknowledge the advances unless you are shaming them for itnin public. A very very public setting.  And never ever ever drink with them!

I regret that now, but that's life - she's met someone else I think and seems to be happy and being such a sweet, good person, that's what I want for her. "
137,"Someone give this man some gold 

Edit; wow! Thanks for the gold üôè"
138,"Yeah.  I taught Anatomy at a community college and the rule was that if a student got to keep their old exams, you simply don‚Äôt give the same exam the following semester.

I think this is pretty absurd behavior on the part of the department.  Those profs should not let him take their exam home.  They made their bed and should have to lie in it IMO."
139,That's hillarious. Glad it worked out.
140,"*Never believe, it's not soooooooooooooooooooo.*"
141,Why did he have a bucket of beet juice to begin with?
142,"What kind of barbarian orders Pils if he is in the Moselle region? Huge red flag.

Well, that and the fact that he tried to get you drunk.
"
143,"Yes, please, if they have (this sense of) humor this will do so much!"
144,"My contract as requested.

145,"I find it hard to believe the police would honor the contract and not play it safe and arrest the husband for domestic violence.  It would be a CYA move by the police because they could just let a judge decide about the contract.  Glad the police were level headed but again, surprised they didn't want to cover their ass."
146,"Monitoring those sites is probably in someone's job description.

The conspiracy theorist in me thinks ~~they have Google Alerts set for every student's names.~~ the school is in cahoots with the website. "
147,What did they claim the reason was for putting you on probation? Hurting the professor's feelings?? 
148,"She walked out to get a cake for....reasons.

When she went to the refrigerator, the door was busted down. Apparently she was trying to explain things but again, she couldn't really do that. 

She escorted them to the room. "
149,That's a marriage contract.
150,"I was thinking, if it were me and I was robbing a place, I would stake it out the day before. But as someone more expert on chav criminals than me pointed out, people like this don‚Äôt do that. They just agree a time and attack. My god they were stupid. "
151,Shit.
152,This was just one really long dad joke
153,Sounds like a Schrute.
154,Phantom Anal Snakes is my new gore metal band
155,"correct.
even though the materials were accessible for free on the website, I was in the wrong by making profit with certain documents. 

it was interesting however how they thought it was unacceptable even to sell my notes, which was my personal created content."
156,"I've had the same. Maybe it's a cultural barrier, different values or whatever, I don't know. But I try to avoid single, 'non-European' men when I travel because I've had too many experiences where they're a little too persistent to talk to me. If I have my nose in a book and only speak in monosyllables, take the hint! Even if their intentions are entirely innocent, I still find it uncomfortable and pushy."
157,"We have one. It's peace of mind for us. Having something in writing helps remind of us boundaries, especially when I may be gagged and unable to voice concerns. Having written the contract out together and discussing it solidifies boundaries and makes us both feel more comfortable."
158,Or because handing themselves over via a formal written contract and signing themselves away turns them on?
159,"BDSM is all about trust and pushing someone to their limits. In a healthy relationship, you discuss these limits, and if your partner feels uncomfortable doing something, you don't do it. A BDSM contract is just these limits written down, so there is no confusion between either party.

It also helps cops understand that both parties agreed to this prior to what appears to be violent behavior."
160,Just last week I overheard someone say ‚Äûthe ladies want it. It‚Äôs not a real no if she doesn‚Äôt punch you in the face‚Äú which would be the exact culture clash you‚Äòre describing 
161,From the title I thought you were in some children‚Äôs themed restaurant.  Where you beat up some guy in a bear costume.  I was picturing projectile vomiting at a child‚Äôs birthday party.
162,ü§îü§î
163,"She dropped the cake when the cops busted the door in. The cake was for ""food stuff""."
164,"Incoming TIFU from OP‚Äôs 4 year old:

TIFU by drilling my mom in the face with a toy.

"
165,Maybe you should put a sign up front that directs visitors towards the doorbell to make sure they don't knock instead?
166,"Looks like he just tries to pimp you out. An overly polite Pakistani buying you drinks in Trier. Red flags all over. 

Be more assertive in life."
167,Best you can do I think is move
168,"Do it, OP. It's a funny story for all involved, you get to explain, and your neighbours get their toilet seat."
169,"It's pretty damn annoying to be a woman sometimes. You just want to go out and DO stuff, like any other person, but then the world has to constantly remind you that you're some sort of prey animal."
170,"You actually did the correct thing by withdrawing. The class won't impact your GPA, and you can take it later. I teach college and had kids and students with the same problem. You will be alright."
171,"Listen OP in this situation you should probably go down, own up to the fact you are there, and then take the side of the rightful home owner. 

Tell them you got your wallet stolen/it's missing AND BOOM, you are both victims to this POS. "
172,"But he didn't just share his notes, which I think is causing the problem. He sold anothers intellectual property (at least that's what exams get called in my honour code), which is a huge nono.

I'm from Europe too and have all my old exams in a folder and let the newer students use them happily. The professors encourage it. But we all know that we can't make money off that.

His class notes, sure. There's tons of sites for that. "
173,This guy bureaucrats. 
174,"Just like the defendant with a jurisprudence fetish.

He got off on a technicality."
175,"dude just explain it to them and pay the bill, they'll laugh their ass off i guarantee it"
176,Cop blocked.
177,"I think my boss thought it was solely due to shock of labour and honestly didn‚Äôt mind. She‚Äôs really friendly and was mostly worried dealing with the two separate ambulances when they arrived! She actually messaged me earlier and asked if I‚Äôd be okay for work tomorrow and sent me well wishes. 

Solid advice though! Thanks x"
178,"I donate whole blood whenever I can (woo, O neg!) and had a similar thing happen. No nausea or vomit, but I made the mistake of not eating beforehand and then just chilling out in my room after until it came time to start preparing dinner (I was still in highschool). Started feeling dizzy while making the salad, started to walk from the kitchen to the living room to sit down for a moment and face planted before I made it to the couch. I was only out for about 30sec, but it was enough for my mom to call an ambulance and take me to the ER. Two heaping bags of saline later and I was fine, but that incident certainly changed my approach to blood donation."
179,My first thought is why the fuck didn‚Äôt you go home for this? 
180,Hopefully the food stuff doesn‚Äôt  involve a coconut 
181,[deleted]
182,"&gt;cops heard it, we couldn't

Dead."
183,"100% learned. Sharing stories like this helps shorten the learning curve. I don't care how many times your mother told you to be a proper lady, there will always be times where only your bitchy side will do."
184,HEY NOW! 
185,Spent all that time building up to the moment the toy hits him and you completely leave that part out? 
186,"See, the issue with these places (the one I go to and have seen reviews for) is that the people handling these needles are ***not*** medical professionals. I have a friend who just got a job at CSL (one of the bigger centers) and he's a weedhead who barely graduated high school (his girl did a whole online class for him) 

Needless to say, I don't think you want someone like my friend sticking needles in you and drawing blood. 

My girlfriend who is also practicing something in the medical industry (always forget exactly what it is) but she gets basic procedures in a hospital setting and she pointed out what they were doing wrong. To give you an idea, the guy we had last time we went did not change his gloves between sticking needles into different people. "
187,"Professor here. Lots of universities have departments which keep an eye on these sites. Most students don‚Äôt anonymise properly, so I occasionally get emails from other universities pointing to the misdeeds of my students.

These sites won‚Äôt hesitate to tell the university if you break any part of your arrangement with them. I‚Äôve also seen a few cases where the site has outright blackmailed a student. I distinctly remember chairing the academic dishonesty panel for a student who, having used an essay mill, was being blackmailed by the company. She requested, during this disciplinary panel, that I grant an extension on all of her work, on the basis that the whole blackmail situation was making her stressed. She did not receive an extension, or indeed graduate."
188,Oh man. I did this with a glass of wine I left out once. I was living in NYC and had a pretty bad fruit fly problem in my apartment. At the peak of my alcoholism I stumbled home one night and wanted to drink more. In my drunken stupor I grabbed the glass and chugged it. Took me a minute to notice the texture was off. So many fruit flies. Wish I could say it helped me quit drinking. Hurrrrrrrkkk.
189,The maggots were just your sperm cells graduating from boot camp
