I‚Äôm here too inform you that psychology and neuroscience have not even been able to determine if Aphantasia even exists.

We actually feel it‚Äôs more plausible that people don‚Äôt understand the term ‚Äúvisualization‚Äù properly.
Some people claim they ‚Äúsee‚Äù it with their mind, and others say ‚Äúwhen I close my eyes all I see is black!!‚Äù 
Well, of course... because you are using your eyes to see something that isn‚Äôt there, and that isn‚Äôt what visualization is.

It‚Äôs being able to know what an Apple looks like without seeing it. It‚Äôs knowing what your house looks like when you aren‚Äôt there. 

Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, and you aren‚Äôt different than anybody else, you just don‚Äôt understand what visualization is from other peoples perspectives."

70,Nothing in this post is the right kind
71,I have a terrible sense of direction and if I want to walk a few blocks down to the supermarket or something I have to visually 'walk' the path in my head to make sure I'm going the right way. I'm sad to learn something like this exists and people can't imagine the world of books.

93,"When I was 25 i read an article about tinnitus (incurable ringing in the ears). Up to that point I thought that having trumpets in your ears is the normal sound of silence. I had no issues with it and even slept normally. 

That article informed me that it wasn't normal. I saw a doctor a while later and apparently I have severe tinnitus (50 decibels). The kind that gives people depression and anxiety, interferes with their sleep and even sometimes drives them to suicide. I had no issues with it up until that point because I thought I was normal. 

After the diagnosis, I started having trouble sleeping, I got anxious and even had occasional panic attacks because of the ringing. Now I can't sleep without a fan pointed at the wall going at max speed. 

I kinda wish I never found out about it. I was perfectly happy and content until I read that article and now it's all I can think about. 

My point is: try to remind yourself that you lived a normal life before making that realization. There was absolutely nothing wrong with you as far as you were concerned. If it's possible, try to forget it and never think about it again. Just keep repeating to yourself that what you have is good enough. 

Nobody gets a perfect body or perfect health. Everyone has a couple of defective parts in their bodies. And the very few who don't will definitely develop defects within a few years. We all end up as worm food anyway. The trick is to take what you have and use it to it's maximum potential before you leave this loud world and all of its trumpets behind."

I would tell your parents about it. Sit down and have a mature conversation with them about what transpired instead of letting them hear by surprise."

Where can we apply to the Lemiius Space Program?"
126,Yup absolutely.  I spent a few months there myself and absolutely there were times where going in for a massage they'd be trying to work me up for more with a brush here or a tap there.

148,"I had this problem every time I went for a massage. Id go in with no intention at all of receiving a happy ending but they'd always entice me somehow by maybe moving their hand around my inner thigh or ""accidently"" touching it when they'd be massaging my stomach, or making my hand 'accidetally' touch their tits. Then once the beast was awoken, they'd ask for 'extra service' and $30 payment. I'd be too horny by then to refuse. I'd always be trapped into it, until I sat down and made M0SHKA's cardinal massage rules. 

Rule 1: ALWAYS pre-wank. If possible, wank twice. 

Rule 2: NEVER carry extra cash. Even if somehow, she still manages to get you hard after rule 1 (happened before), you need to make sure you don't have any money you can pay her. 

Rule 3: Prevention better than cure : Think about people who died in my family and other sad memories during my massage. (This one got me more worked up than relaxed during a massage once and I almost cried.)"

So anyways, I was roughin up the ol suspect (if you know what I mean) and I open my snaps to see my best friend accidentally posted a video of him pulling his pud (if you know what I mean).  It was then I realized that I was actually live streaming myself crankin‚Äô my yank (if you know what I mean).  

I gasped out loud and my way hot GF, who was playing with the little man in the pink kayak (if you know what I mean) in the bathroom, screamed out ‚ÄòOP!  WHY ARE YOU FLOGGING YOUR MOLLY?!? (If you know what she means).  I was going to reply - but it was too late!

Turns out my 10/10 GF was FaceTiming my mom who was in the process of doing the morning announcements at school.   SO THE ENTIRE school now knows what‚Äôs going on.  And to make matters worse, CNN was there doing some story about some kid who broke his arms - and the announcement about Rosey introducing Dick to her five friends (if you know what I mean) was heard during the *live interview* with the principal!

I‚Äôm so embarrassed right now! I just want to curl up under my blanket and die!

207,"I love books, and have actually written four (really bad) novels and have a degree in Literature. But, when I read I don't ""see it in my head"". It's always just been text for me. When I think of a word, I see the word in my head as text on a printed page, not an image of what the thing represents. I don't have aphantasia, if I try to visualize something I can, but that's not where my mind go. It hasn't taken any joy from reading for me. It also means I'm usually not disappointed by the movie version of a book, since I don't really have a visual in my head of the characters and I'm ok with however they depict it. It does hurt my writing, as I tend to skip over physical descriptions of the characters unless/until something about them is actually relevant to the plot. But I've been told I give really amazing descriptions of sounds and smells. I think some of us just aren't ""visual"" people. But I promise we can still enjoy the world of books."

We got a new HR person at a place I worked and they made us do sexual harassment training. The lady was hella bad at it and very misinformed, to the point that she told the men that the laws only protect women and they should really consider what they say to women. While we were in the room together as a team, which includes women, the men concluded that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to women in the office and possibly shouldn‚Äôt hire any more. The HR lady suggested the first was a good idea, but the second was TECHNICALLY illegal but that were an at will state. 3 of us women were fired within 2 weeks, the three that were like ‚Äòwtf no laws also protect men‚Äô. 

So yeah, you‚Äôre acting like she‚Äôs got the plague, she‚Äôs likely terrified she‚Äôs losing her job. If she‚Äôs a good employee, see if there‚Äôs any way you can do a job review so it‚Äôs on record that she‚Äôs a good employee.

If not, what are you thinking of? The idea of your house or apartment?"" Just like ""Hmm yes, I do have a house/apartment."" Is that what it's limited to? If I tell you to think of ""blue,"" do you not see blue? What happens when you daydream? Do you daydream? Are your thoughts limited to abstraction? Could you see even your significant other's face?

The picture I had was of said spring in the toilet. It was a fuck up because I didn't have anything to reach in and remove it with and would've had to leave the restroom to get something so I just reached in with my hand and grabbed it.

So what am I supposed to say about that? ""Exasperated by the spring that slowly sank to the depths of the toilet bowl I had to think fast.

During that time we tried to reconcile and we were intimate during the time. A few weeks later she calls and says she is pregnant and tells me at the time there is no way he is mine. I go on about my life...kind of. I just so happen to know someone recently pregnant and she has a pregnancy dial that goes of due date and conception. The date she is due shows that she was with me on the exact date. Being a product of a terrible divorce situation I will NEVER let go of my kids. I was there the day he was born, we were married five days later and despite my strong feeling he is not mine....he will ALWAYS be mine. My wife wouldn‚Äôt allow the paternity test in the hospital and I am off of the birth certificate because of her fear. Chances are he is not my making but I have made him the best possible young man he can be and he has made me the best father that I can be. I love him unconditionally and despite my interest in knowing...it doesn‚Äôt matter. I have all of my kids names tattooed on my body and he is the ‚ÄúJohn Hancock‚Äù of them all the largest and the one I am most proud of!  I love him with all that I have. I am sorry your family went through this and you got the outcome you wanted. I sometimes want to do the test but more than anything I just want to be his father and that, I have already done."

The odds of finding *one* woman who is such a sex driven nympho such that she gets off on watching a guy suck himself off, is beyond immeasurable.  Finding *multiple* women who are of this quality, such that this scenario:
&gt;She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock.

is possible, would be akin to getting struck by lightening while simultaneously winning consecutive lotteries.

Perhaps this subreddit trends younger, and a lot of you just don't have adult dating/relationship experience.  But, the 'norm' to saying that you can suck yourself off probably isn't, ""Wow, that's hot. I wanna see!""  It would be more akin to, ""That's weird. You actually find that enjoyable?...""

393,"Off-topic, but this reminds me of something that happened when I was a kid. So I'm in church with my grandparents, about 10 years old, not paying attention as usual. I decide I want to go to the lake after church so I ask my grandpa if ""he'll go with me"", not mentioning what I meant. 

Yeah, turns out that was the exact part where the preacher was asking if anyone wants to come up to agree to be baptized. Next thing I know, I'm walking down to the front with my grandpa. He looked so proud of me, I couldn't back out then. 

So that's how I got accidentally baptized."

‚ÄúDoctors around the world are searching for answers as a rash of uniquely similar injuries flood ERs around the globe. Patients are predominantly males aged 14 to 40 all being admitted with light headedness, sprained joints, and bumps on the head from passing out and falling to the ground. The strangest similarities being their various states of undress, the presence of ejaculate on there‚Äôs hands, clothes and even hair, and the overwhelming reluctance to go into details of what happened.

We go to reporter in the field Ben Jakkenit for more, Ben;‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks Herb I‚Äôm here at saint Josephs hospital in downtown Springfield where the patients continue to trickle in with the tell tale signs of this rising epidemic.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow Ben, how are you able to discern which patients are in fact victims of this strange blight?‚Äù

‚ÄúSimple Herb, their parents faces. Especially the moms. There‚Äôs just a immense look of disappointment mixed with embarrassment on all their faces. That and the fact that a large number of them seem to be dazed and humming a popular David Bowie tune as they‚Äôre helped into the hospital. It‚Äôs all very strange.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

They brought me to the doc and I can still remember couple things :

\- How freaking good it feels to have someone expertly rummage throught your ear, getting all the wax out.

\- Right after he unclogged both my ears, I guenuinely believed they had turned on microphones and speakers were amplifiying every sound in the room.

\- In one ear, he pulled out a wax ball the size of a wasp (might not seem pretty big, but it is impressive when you compare it to the size of a kid's ear canal) that smelled terrible.

* First cousin, known whole life, almost certainly +/- 7-8 years in age, is ""very close with"" and yet doesn't know (or recognize) the name of the company she works at


* In the same city with cousin he's close with, but doesn't make sure to schedule time to visit with her during his trip, beforehand?


* Very large companies almost never send messengers to hand deliver a single envelope to an individual's office WITHOUT the delivery person having that individual's name. AND she would have no reason to hide her name if her hottie-from-Kik was going to see it on her door, anyways.

I had already seen the movie but I love books so figured yeah, let's read this thing! Well unbeknownst to me, the copy he owns is merged with short stories written by the same author. The short stories are at the end of the book, and there are probably 4-5 stories meaning 4-5 extra chapters. There is literally NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE END OF I AM LEGEND AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SHORT STORIES. No ""THE END,"" no title page for the new story about to begin, nothin. So I read the end of I Am Legend, and kept reading thinking the book wasn't over yet. All the short stories were bizarre, one about witches in the woods, one about a guy getting weird phone calls - they were so off topic from I Am Legend that I was confused, but excited that it was somehow going to turn around in some amazing plot twist. By the last page I was so mad - I put it down thinking \*what the holy hell was that\*, a completely unsatisfying feeling when finishing a book. The whole reading experience was tainted and I don't think I have gotten over it yet, haha. I really wish I had gotten to enjoy that book for what it is!"

anyways,  here is an idea of how to play it, and also do a pro revenge type thing.

- to your boss ask to have a moment to speak privately,  and tell the whole truth.  This person was your ex gf,  she didn't recognize me, I thought she was being a bitch to me and kinda played along.  And then I realized she really didn't recognize me.   she was my girlfriend, she cruelly dumped me, she broke my heart, she destroyed me.  

And now I see that I really meant so little to her that she really does not recognize me,  so I got really pissed off and played the part.  
But  boss, please don't say anything to her or do anything for me.  I don't know what to do, but I'll try to figure it out.  I don't want a confrontation or to damage working here. 

When she dumped me she said I was fat, ugly, and had the most annoying voice in the world.  Crikey,  how can she not recognize my voice as the most annoying voice in the world.  (gets your eyes teared up here,  maybe pull a nose hair out discretely).

1. The female friend does not come over when the wife is home

2. He admitted the female friend was pretty although he said he would never be able to forgive himself if he cheated

3. It was late in the evening

4. The kids were asleep

5. They were both wearing pyjamas

6. When presented with the idea that he and the friend has sex when they were drunk and no longer remember it, he said if that happened, he would be glad he didn't remember it

7. The above point demonstrates he did get drunk, possibly to the point of short term memory loss

601,"Is there a surefire way to know if you have aphantasia? I'll try to put my question in the simplest terms.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not have aphantasia, are you able to imagine an apple right in front of you? Like, it has all qualities of an apple, excluding touch and smell, of course(similar to a hologram or vr, or maybe a construction game like the sims or bridge connector)? or is it just a thought, in a way? Similar to that of the voice you use in your head? Is it like, a think you think of and can describe, but can't see? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just asking this cause I *think* I might have aphantasia. I'm just confused, to be honest, cause all I think of when I try to imagine an apple is what defines an apple, and how it acts. I can think of how fast it would slide down a slope and how many pieces it can explode into, but not how it rolls or the specific fissures that appear when it hits the ground. I'm just confused tbh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I've been rambling, and just being young and dumb. Any description and definition of ""imagine"" would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Is imagining something similar to that of seeing in a VR headset? Or is it just a thought, similar to that of speaking in your mind?"

So I was jankin' my wank diddler to some hot sexy ass lesbian scissoring video with a bag of rice up against my bro globes. My parents have a history of conservatism and racism against asians so severe that rice is not a part of our household, so I developed a fetish for those things specifically. Just when I was about to have a tremendous orgasm to rival the eruption of Krakatoa and release an amount of baby gravy that would dwarf the size of the multiverse, my sister opens the door to ask if I've seen where her dank ass pizza roles went. I froze as my dip-dong-dingle throbbed and pulsated and similar synonyms as a fountain of thick man-mayo erupted with the force of exactly ten thousand hurricanes. She panicked and ran to mom to tell her what she saw. I'm still waiting for the shitstorm. I expect I will be disowned.

Edit: thanks for my first gold kind stranger!

Edit: wow, this blew up!

Edit: update: my parents threw me out of the house for masturbating to lesbian porn. I took the rice with me. My sister winked at me as I left, I'm not sure if it was out of malice or some sick delight in seeing me naked. Thanks for all the awards kind strangers."

You might be able to summon up a very rough visual image of the basic thing, but it takes a lot of focus and as soon  as you read the next attribute you lose the last. When i say rough by the way, I mean rough. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the text describes a man as 6 feet tall with brown hair and a scar on his cheek I can kinda picture a rough outline of a person, like a thin pale white line on a black background, no detail. As soon as i read the words ""with brown hair"" it's the same pale white outline of the top of someones forehead. The hair i can't picture as brown is too dark - if the text said blonde then the forehead outline would have a yellowish blob on top, no hair texture or definitive shape. As soon as I read ""scar on his cheek"" it's kind of the same thing  outline of the bottom quarter of a face with a random line somewhere in it as the scar. The image kinda ""flickers"" as well, maybe 5-6 times over about 2 seconds, then disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is measurement. Because I can only form the most basic of shape for probably less than a second at a time, distances are pretty irrelevant. When I read Game of Thrones i knew The Mountain was a giant, wealds a greatsword one handed etc but as I can't picture him and someone else at the same time, all I get is 'man has sword'. The wall simply was not impressive to me in the same way until I saw book-accurate artwork because all I could see is a rough white rectangle. I could still appreciate the sheer scale of the thing, but I never saw it until I was on awoiaf.
