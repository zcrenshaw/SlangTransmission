0,Happy Mother‚Äôs day ‚ô°
1,"This is quite possibly the most selfish shit I‚Äôve ever read. She hooks up with her own friend, without asking you if it‚Äôs okay, then proceeds to literally tell you it‚Äôs okay for you to join, then breaks up with you for it. 

Forget her, dude."
2,"""I knew he was actually French because accent was way better than mine""

Or hes just been in this game longer than you can imagine."
3,Had a girlfriend who made out with a girl at a party that I wasn‚Äôt at. The girl was bi/lesbian. I had to remind her that that was still cheating...
4,"Now you‚Äôre an orgy guy, you need to get new friends, orgy friends."
5,"&gt; Never going back.

No, keep going."
6,"Or call the friend, she didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all üòâ"
7,Plot twist: OP was legit testing the waters and this is his cover.
8,"Dude, finding this diary is the BEST thing that could have happened in this relationship! Run for your life!"
9,"Instead of telling them to call you when they need something, ask them if they wouldn't mind giving you a quick call every few days to say hi. Tell them you love to hear from them, and in their minds, it's not a bother, but rather a task which can help give them something to do.

I know, it sounds mean giving a simple job to elderly people, but they can make it part of their routine and it can hopefully make them feel useful, even in a small way."
10,I‚Äôm a dentist...people have very ‚Äúcurious‚Äù tongues and I can only imagine that would be worsened by grape flavored gloves. I think your dentist needs to have a sense of humor. The days get boring without patients like you.
11,Did you stay after class!?!?
12,double standard is fine as long as it benefits me.
13,"People act super weird when they are in the dental chair. The anxiety doesn‚Äôt help matters. I‚Äôve had my fingers licked and sucked by accident 100 times because the patient thought it was the suction tip. He probably forgot about the interaction shortly afterwards. Don‚Äôt sweat it.

14,"Only way you'll get the teasing to stop is to assert dominance. Next time relatives start teasing, say that you'll fuck them next. Also you can say you wish to keep the bloodline pure. Fucking mudbloods smh."
15,"Next time, I'll bite him."
16,"That threesome was probably a foursome, there had to be a forth to take the picture. 

Happy Mother's day"
17,Gotta end it.
18,She knew
19,Burn everything start a new life but this time be German
20,I‚Äôm sorry you saw your step dad with hair.
21,This is why he drinks.
22,"Bro Code: If a Bro is showing you a picture on his phone, DO NOT swipe."
23,"&gt;we decided to never reveal this major cock-up to a soul

&gt;she immediately tells her dad

What the fuck Isla"
24,"You didn‚Äôt fu. She was having fun with her friend, invited you in and when you asked she said yes only to change her mind.

According to your description of event, you did nothing wrong; she is unable to face the fact that she agreed to it and instead of acknowledging that she wasn‚Äôt ok with it after all, take the blame, talk about like an adult either during or after, she blames you for going through with it.

I understand you love her, try to have an adult conversation and remove all emotions from the discussion. If she blames you, move on."
25,"Dude your mom's just happy nothing it's seriously wrong. That being said, expect this to come up at your wedding."
26,Congratulations! Probably the most ethical and understandable possible way to miss the birth of your child.
27,"&gt;It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep if I didn‚Äôt open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT.

It would be a shame if this post were to reach the front page too. ;)"
28,"I think the funniest part is the comment chain of your slow, but inevitable,  realisation."
29,"""The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an  Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in  this house""

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Says *bonjour* once

\&gt;I have to live with this lie or my life will end"
30,That‚Äôs your moms fault lol
31,Dude wtf... blame her not yourself.  Don't get back with her
32,"I asked my GF what she wanted for Christmas and she sent me a pic of a diamond ring she liked. I gave it to her and now it turns out, we're engaged! I'm a schmuck. I thought it was a christmas gift."
33,"Sooo how did you guys meet!?  Well, I was all hopped up on goofball gas just kicked back in his chair and licking his purple fingers."
34,This is the move
35,"Well actually yes everyone in France has been pretending to understand and speak french for the past 1000 years, please send help"
36,"I'm sorry, that sounds like a rough situation. 

Even though 2nd cousins are sometimes called ""kissing cousins"" due to the ability to legally marry, its still a bad situation to find yourself in.

Mad respect for breaking it off quietly, too."
37,"""I'll keep it short for you peeps""

No pun intended there, huh?"
38,What was dinner like? Did you guys actually stay and have a meal?
39,"My fiance did this. His graduation is tomorrow but he told his mom today and her flight is leaving before his ceremony tomorrow.

We found the mistake because I asked him to look up the time so I could tell my mom. He pulled it up and when I told my mom it was Sunday, he looked at me like I was crazy. Apparently 5 emails and pulling it up twice want enough for him.

I'm writing this while waiting for my name to get called in my own graduation."
40,"I mean, are both of y'all single? Cuz there's worse ways to meet someone"
41,Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy?  It changes everything.  You have to dress different.  You have to act different.  You have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and you need a new bedspread and new curtains. You have to get thick carpeting and weirdo lighting...
42,"This isn't just bro code, it's just code. Showing somebody a picture on your phone isnt permission to look at \*all\* their pictures."
43,The real question is. Who took the pictures?
44,working up the baby's tolerance to spice. Shit happens... now you know... won't do that again.
45,Sorry doc but 'cha gassed me.  Wild card!
46,"so it's okay for her to "" making out and grabbing "" with her friend (and I assume that shouldn't bother you), but not okay for you. Interesting."
47,I come from a country where parents would be delighted at this revelation!
48,If you're 6'11 you're just as unusual as she is.
49,"There is definitely something the police can do if the guy hacked into someones snapchat to threaten to beat you up.

Do you have a screenshot of the message?"
50,"To be fair to you, if I heard ""Bucky Balls"" and ""adult toy"" in the same sentence, I wouldn't assume the thing in question was particularly innocent!"
51,Make sure to maintain eye contact and then blame the nitrous oxide.
52,This honestly made me feel better.  Thank you!
53,"No one says ""You can bowl me.."""
54,‚ÄúHow can he slap?‚Äù
55,"&gt;am tooth carpenter

I'm 100% stealing this once I finish dental school"
56,"As much as I'm sure they'd love to secede, Alabama still doesn't count as a country"
57,Congrats!  And this is why you don't just start swiping through pictures on people's phones.
58,I thought taking my bird for a walk meant like putting a really small dog collar and a leash on him and walking him around so you walk around with a little waddling bird
59,Biggest unanswered question of the story
60,I once glanced at my dental folder when I was a kid and it said I had a 'strong' 'roaming' tongue. Not sure how I should feel about that.
61,Hopefully your family will have a laugh and enjoy your accomplishment. Have a family picnic.
62,"Shouldn‚Äôt mention how you don‚Äôt like getting messages, cause now people are going to message you just to watch the world burn."
63,"#1, TURN OFF LOCATION IN SNAP."
64,Because he can't suck his own dick.
65,Reddit should make a forum called TMMFU
66,Classic Schmosby.
67,"You may have been undead, but karma was alive and kicking."
68,"It‚Äôs pretty clear that she‚Äôs not over this ex, and even if she got it out of her system that‚Äôs still not something I‚Äôd be okay with. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre pretty young, because that is a sign of immaturity and lack of control on her part."
69,staceys mom has
70,"&gt;Two- My mother sucking off my stepdad, In my dad's house. On the counter. Where I eat.

Wait... before or after your parents broke up?"
71,"Yeah well no offense but your mom was being an asshole, that‚Äôs that"
72,"Reddit has spoken. 

https://i.imgur.com/26ghsIi.jpg"
73,r/cursedcomments
74,Sweet home Canabama
75,Oh no you don‚Äôt!
76,"Also, I‚Äôd recommend also leaving them a few notes to remind you to call. &lt;3 that way, if they forget, the notes/cards whatever can remind them."
77,"You were pretending to be French for ten months but you didn‚Äôt  bother to, you know, learn French?"
78,That will make a great story later when you do propose and now you can do it in the same fashion as well as a running joke.
79,"TMMFU

Well it was actually 17 years ago, when she gave birth to me"
80,You have to bang her mom.
81,I believe the usual answer would be the English.
82,Exactly. OP doesn't need a woman who's opinions change like the tide. Imagine a week day after marriage she wants a divorce because you forgot to flush a taco bell shit slurry that you left in the toilet accidentally after having to pick her up from the airport while also paying your overdue water bills because SOMEONE was suppose to do it in your place.
83,"What is best in life?  A strong roaming tongue.  To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations¬†of their women."
84,"* points finger gun * keep it up and you‚Äôre next, gram gram"
85,Yea dude you should definitely end it at this point your just getting played like a fiddle.
86,"To quote ""Mean Girls"":

&amp;#x200B;

**Karen**: You know who's looking fine tonight? Seth Mosakowski.  
**Gretchen**: Okay, you did not just say that.  
**Karen**: What? He's a good kisser.  
**Gretchen**: He's your cousin.  
**Karen**: Yeah, but he's my first cousin.  
**Gretchen**: Right.  
**Karen**: So, you have your cousins, and then you have your first cousins, and then you have your second cousins...  
**Gretchen**: No, honey, nuh-uh.  
**Karen**: That's not right, is it?  
**Gretchen**: That is so not right."
87,Doesn‚Äôt matter had sex
88,I suggest dressing up as Capatin Jack Sparrow and be like.. I'm on the hunt for some booty.
89,"I would tell them now.  Honestly, they are coming for you not a 4 hour parade."
90,"Second cousins aren't really that scandalous.  The closest relative you share is your great great grandparents, I think.  

I mean, shit, Einstein married his first cousin."
91,"Ah fuck, I've can't believe you've done this."
92,"The hardest break ups are the ones over circumstance, rather than incompatibility or personal issues.

Mad respect, indeed."
93,Biological dad ftw
94,"The other day I was in a park and a hummingbird zipped right in front of me and hovered.  I'd never seen one in the wild before, especially up close, so I whipped out my camera phone and started following him.   He mostly ignored me, zipping around to different flowers on the green.  I got some great shots.

After I was done, I realized half a dozen sunbathers were glaring at me, and the women were covering themselves and angrily whispering to their friends.  The hummingbird was invisible from where they were.  I was just some weirdo who ran out on a grassy area where women were working on their tans and started taking pictures left and right with an idiot grin on my face."
95,I'll bet a dentist has more of an oral fixation than I do!  HE'S the weird one!  Right? Right guys...?
96,"French guy: \*frenching away in French\*
You: ... *omelette du fromage?*"
97,"If it makes you feel better, a drunk guy saw how small I was and picked me up and played ‚Äúairplane‚Äù with me üôÉ"
98,"""i have my period and your mum's cat jumped on me in the bathroom"" probably would have been a pretty reasonable reply"
99,Glad you found him.  Now don't go outside with him again lol
100,Yup. Get away from that mess asap. Nothing good will come of it.
101,The fact that you‚Äôre still around probably already means the world to them. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up too hard.
102,"The ""Double crap"" killed me"
103,Your dad realized he had been blind to the possibilities and had to immediately try it for himself
104,"Between the fianc√© and I, apologies were bouncing back and forth. She felt bad. I felt bad. **My penis felt worse**. My roommate on the other hand, he had a stomach bug and couldn't really mock me as much he wanted to. Poor dude. The three of us had a good laugh over breakfast. We praised the fianc√© for preventing the zombie apocalypse as well as mourned my mangled balls."
105,Who just texts a new number to a new person without introducing themselves first?
106,"As soon as I read your title, I thought you had broken some part of your body. Though, what actually happened doesn't seem much worse."
107,"Dentist here. People lick our fingers all the time. Tongues are curious. Don't sweat it, OP.

Unless you start to suck on my finger and stare directly into my soul - then it becomes weird."
108,At least op didn't miss his graduation..
109,"Hey! What a cool feature! I can let everyone know where I am !
All
The time!
/s

Like....seriously? Why the fuck would anyone leave that on?"
110,"Maybe they were eating at Olive Garden, where everyone is family"
111,"That ended surprisingly well - I love that you both were laughing at the end.

FWIW - I proposed 2 months after our first date (we met at work a couple of months before that). 27 years ago."
112,Show your friend the photo again for true celebration
113,That's a nice idea! Thank you random stranger!
114,"""Gosh teach isn't their something I could do to earn that A"""
115,[X-Files theme intensifies]
116,Should I tell them all now or wait till they get here?
117,Not of the Snapchat. I was kinda freaked out so I blocked it immediately. But the police have him documented saying he wants to fight from when we were pulled over. The other Roomates in the girls apartment   Can definitely vouch for me tho because the Ex told them what he was gonna do.
118,So did he give you an A or the D?
119,This is 100% the truth
120,Impromptu family reunion! Let‚Äôs make it a tradition.
121,"my neighbor andy, that's who"
122,"Yeah when we get a new place and are un boxing i turn and ""hey babe look what i found"" Rofl"
123,"Using ""there"" correctly might help."
124,"When I unpacked his luggage, I found a harness for exactly that - and I've watched youtubes of people training their birds to wear them. But the first 5 seconds of the training videos are along the lines of ""Step one: make sure your bird is comfortable enough with you to lie on his back in the palm of your hand."" Pffft. May as well throw in that he needs to be trained to make my bed and braid my hair before we get started."
125,"I mean personally I think ""bone Mason"" is way more appropriate."
126,"I think the next picture he will get will be a sonogram, if we are blessed with a pregnancy"
127,Start slapping his ass during dinner to assert dominance.
128,op might have a mouth fetish...
129,"Yeah I like how OP just kinda casually opened with that like ""Yeah so I was hanging out with my gf, and her friend was there too, and they were just making out, you know, as you do"". Like how did the question of ""Is this okay"" not even come up until they were already all in bed together naked, about to get started?"
130,In my experience I've always had guys talk about how hot me kissing a girl would be or a threesome would be and I'm having to remind them that it's cheating in my books and I'm monogamous.
131,"I don't think it was wrong, I love how liberal and caring my mom was bringing me up. Nothing I wanted to hear from her as her 16 year old son though. 

You're right, it'll come up for sure. She teases me about it whenever the opportunity arises. Guess I'll just have to tell everyone at the wedding before she can."
132,"Did you read any of her post history? She sounds like literally the funnest. 

&gt;He's made the mistake of going out of town a couple of times. The first time, I bought a ton of tin foil from the dollar store and literally wrapped every single item in his man cave in foil (not the TV tho) down to coins and the ceiling fan. The second time he went out of town, I had a bunch of friends over and we blew up a ton of balloons and stuffed his man cave floor to ceiling with them. That was actually really fun because the night he got home we did shrooms and played in the room full of balloons."
133,yeah but no one really gets to look down on 6 11 people.
134,"*Detectives standing over a dead body. *

Detective 1: Here we go again, Johnson. Same markings as last time, same dentist‚Äôs bib. Pay attention rookie, you might learn something.  *Reaches into mouth to extract a small piece of blue glove*

Detective 2: Oh shit boss. Is that what I think it is? *covers his mouth*

Detective 1: *lifting the piece of glove to his nose and smells it* This sick sumbitch has an oral fixation, likes to reach into his victim‚Äôs mouths while he chokes them to death. Looks like this one fought back. *Looks at his partner while lifting the piece of glove into the light* The smell test never lies. He‚Äôs back, after all these years. 

Detective 2: The Grapist..."
135,"Now fuck your uncle, got to show that dominance."
136,"Congrats!  FYI: Labor that is less than 4hrs is known as precipitous labor and the likelyhood is that each successive birth will take even less time!  Just in case you are planning more down the road.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: My first was an induction and was 4.25hrs from starting the iv to induce to baby, second was 2.5hrs.  Everyone thinks this is what they want in labor till I explain that there is no getting on top of any stage of labor.  Basically the longest panic attack ever."
137,Ten *months*? I don't think even potato guy had that kind of commitment.
138,Hilarious that even people in foreign countries make fun of Alabama.

&gt;**Oh crap, I‚Äôve just realised...How to edit a title?** 3.6K 2Golds 2Silvers"
140,Right?!
141,You. Sound. Fun
142,I guess it is but i feel like i just let it happen
143,Oops
144,That's a really far apart relation. Like... no extra chance of genetic deformities. So you basically broke up due to social stigma and nothing else.
145,"Meet them, aye. Jizz inside uncle bill‚Äôs long-lost daughter? I‚Äôll pass on that thanks."
146,I mean....who do we send though?
147,"I also always show up to work really early. The one time I slept through my alarm, my boss called me, not the police."
148,"*takes dentures out*

*winks at you*"
149,"Honestly, that's more respectable than 50% of my college friends real actual stories of how they got together."
150,Old Valyria?
151,"Add the caption ""I did your sister!"" for the final touch."
152,"You heard me, lol."
153,I'd honestly be relieved. I hate those damn ceremonies.
154,This thread is cursed
155,I can imagine it was mortifying but you were a good friend. You thought you'd been asked for a sex toy and you didn't judge them you just did your best to get someone the perfect present and isn't that the best give you can give?
156,To get the taste out of his mouth from succeeding.
157,"It sounds more like a maturity issue.  It was all fun and games until she realized how it was really making her feel.  I also suspect that when she said ""it was okay"", she really didnt mean it.  She just didnt have the maturity to handle the situation."
158,"This is nice and old school. Most people have to crack a phone password to get that kind of info these days. 

This is a good thing. Walk away and never look back."
159,"In my experence, family gatherings/family reunions are a great place to meet people..."
160,"My ten year old loves to hear stories about what a ‚Äòterrible mother‚Äô I was when he was a baby, if your family is anything like mine this will become a classic. 

Hang in there, you‚Äôre doing fine. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
161,"You're second cousins which is definitely far enough apart there shouldn't be any type of genetic issues if you were to stay together and have kids. 

Additionally you mentioned that you felt he was the one. If you felt that strongly about him I feel like you should really question if that's worth giving up. Your parents aren't close at all with over 30 years estrangement. I've seen several people on Reddit make it work when it was worth it."
162,"I'm thirthy, in a 4 year relationship and about to have a kid.
Until just now I also thought blueballs was just slang or so for being touchy feely with someone but striking out and not getting laid."
163,My ex-boyfriend would always say it was ok for me to kiss girls because of how hot it was. The *one* time I took him up on that he threw a hissy-fit when he realized I wasn't kissing girls for *his* amusement and it wasn't going to lead to a three-way...
164,Lmao. This is wonderful. Why not tell the truth? Not like you have anything to lose. This is a great story. You‚Äôll be the eccentric weird neighbor who pretended to be French for 10 months instead of the liar who lied for 10 months.
165,Je agre√©. Le jouer est zehr witzig. Allez! Allez!
166,The only logical thing to do is to kill him first op
167,I feel like that would have been the smart thing to do.
168,"My SO is 4ft 7. We‚Äôve been together 9 years and I‚Äôve lost count of how many times we‚Äôve been to a restaurant and she‚Äôs been given a children‚Äôs menu. I find it hilarious, thankfully she can also see the funny side."
169,You are 100% correct
170,"I recently bought a Let's Go Pikachu switch and transferred all of my stuff off of my old switch onto the new one.  My old one is just sitting in it's box now, I was going to resell it on eBay or Offer Up or whatever, but uh...this seems like a better option.

What is the etiquette for this on Reddit, it feels really weird just asking you to PM me your address, but if you want a switch it's yours all ya have to do is ask."
171,Maybe shes already two moves ahead of him.
172,Same thing happened to Walter White.  He was a making a meth deal when his daughter was born and life was a downward trajectory after that.
173,I had friend who banged this girl then later banged her sister at a party and finally banging their super hot mom. I've never been so jealous of a guy
174,Well who wears grape flavored gloves then gets upset when someone licks them? He put them in your mouth after all...
175,The images killed me üòÇ
176,You've done this your yourself OP!
177,"It would have been more fun if the mother was writing this post, which would go like -- 

My daughter's boyfriend asked me to blow him and I said i am more than happy to oblige.  Turns out he meant bowl and not blow. Not sure what to do now, since I have already indicated my desire."
178,Sister-fucking is the only thing that puts it on the map my friend.
179,"Or when y'all have been married for  a year and she's digging in a drawer and is like ""hey look what I found"" and holds out a positive pregnancy test."
180,"The real TIFU was breaking up with your 2nd cousin.  2nd cousins (assuming your parents are 1st cousins) share on average 3.125% of their DNA.  You may want to consult with your state laws, but this is a cultural taboo rather than a genetic issue.  Hell, if you didn't know you were 2nd cousins, how would anyone else ever find out?"
181,Asking the real question.
182,Right? Glad I‚Äôm not the only person who immediately went there.
183,Drunks and dwarves have been natural enemies since the dawn of time.

191,My girlfriend liked this idea the most
192,To be fair... He was on LSD
193,"Dang. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs just bad luck! It‚Äôs not like you purposefully fed the baby a pepper. If he quit crying and he isn‚Äôt exhibiting any symptoms, he is probably okay. I‚Äôd check with the family doctor soon just in case. Just make sure you are extra cautious in the future and I‚Äôm sure everything will be fine! :) I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre doing great at being a dad!"
194,at least your family cared enough to come. no feeling worse than driving home alone with your diploma
195,I came here to ask if OPs girlfriends name was Stacy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
196,"In Canada it's only illegal to marry immediate family (siblings, parents, children, grandparents and grandchildren). Cousins, aunts/uncles are all fair game."
197,"Did your mum apologize? 

Wtf is wrong with her, even saying that to your son who is clearly in a relationship he likes is fucked up, sorry to get personal but what kind of mother does that?"
198,That‚Äôs the real deviant part - picture of him with hair is in her wank-bank
199,But what was his reaction to it? Did you all have a good laugh afterwards?

203,Plus he can be inside your mouth for at least 20 minutes!
204,I think the only think OP did wrong was when she ran out without saying anything his first thought was ehh probably peeing
205,Write a new entry for today that says you broke up with her and then break up with her
206,"Oh no! There's no way to recover from that - you'd have to go up to each one of them, and just approaching them would make you seem even more creepier."
207,Or even left!!
208,I love you too
209,Asking the real questions
210,I won't but it was a teaching lesson. I just feel like we peaked in our 20s and then it's just going down from there.
211,"I wonder if they uploaded this to any of those Amateur websites. *But there's so many.*

212,Run. DOO DO DO DOO
213,I would have a conversation with your mom about how hurtful and unnecessary her comment was.
214,"Say that to my ex wife. Was sure immature, but not that young. Did it more than once. I tried, but eventually said fuck it, and left. Best decision I ever made"
215,"My ex husband did something kinda similar, but not really....he waited till the morning of graduation to tell his parents not to bother coming because he wasn't getting his diploma! Congrats on your degree!"

It might not have changed the outcome in the end but that's definitely the wrong move when your SO walks out in the middle of a three-way without specifying where they're going."

236,"I have dwarfism and use a power wheelchair.  I do stand up comedy (I don't stand up, it's not like a laying of hands thing.)

I arrived early to our regular open mic a few weeks ago.  To my surprise, there was a dwarf working as the door man.  Several times people stopped, saw me, saw him, and looked at eachother.

A little later I went up to him, intending to make friends, and assuming he knew I was a comedian.  ""You should tell people it's a convention.""  He looked confused.  ""You know, a little people's convention.""

He turned away from me and looked visibly offended.  I felt **horrible**.  Here I am, half of my set is about the dumb shit people say and do to me like this patronizing hands-on-knees stance, and here I am BEING one of those people.  I said ""I'm sorry, my names 3ftDick, what's your's?""  He painfully told me his name and clearly didn't want to mend any fences.  I went back to the stage area defeated and didn't speak to him the whole time.

I have said regularly that I wish I knew people more like me, but the first opportunity I get, I totally blow."

245,Sidestory about a strong tongue: a child I took care of had macroglossia. That‚Äôs an extremely large tongue that hung out of their mouth. We‚Äôre seeing the doc one day and doc puts a tongue depressor in their mouth. This kid in literally one fast as lightning flick of their tongue breaks the tongue depressor in half. This is a 1 yr old. It‚Äôs hands down the wildest thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I had no idea how strong tongues could be lol
246,They all ordered the meatloaf. And everyone agreed that it tasted just like Grandma used to make it.
247,Yes she did apologize but I 100% agree with you it makes no sense to me still that she would say any thing of that sort in general
248,"You know, as someone from the state, I've always hated that joke. Yeah we allow for first cousin marriages but so do most European countries. We know incest is bad, and there are so many states that deserve the jokes more than us, like West Virginia.

253,"No no no! You didn't fuck up at all bro! She was the one kissing her friend and doing stuff first, then asked you to join, then you made double sure it was ok, then she got jelly and broke up with you. Here is what I think happened. She was all hot and bothered and wanted it, then when her hornyness most likely calmed down a little bit she got really jelly but didn't want to seem like an asshole when you were about to put your D in her friend so she left the room. Then she spent all night twisting it around in her head to make her self feel better and pin you as the bad guy, then broke up with you. Absolutely 100% not your fault dude."

Girlfriend at the time was grinding, grabbing, and kissing on some girl at a party right in front of me. I straight up told her that wasn't ok, and her defense was ""it's ok because I'm not gay/bi"". 

Well guess who came out as bi a few months later, and guess who condemned one of my female friends for doing the exact same thing.

Glad to be out of that relationship."
269,"Right?  My best guess is that he has them for children's appointments and had run out of regular latex.  Our first appointment he just wore regular chalky latex gloves.  Apparently, these grape flavored ones are subtly delicious but I don't think he could be convinced to wear them on strange adults again."

273,Why were the gloves flavored though? Sounds weird as fuck
274,"Yeah, if they were first cousins, that might be a minor worry (and it's really quite minor), with this stage of separation they'd be perfectly fine.  They've both effectively thrown away a good relationship over peer pressure(social stigma).

That's just a goddamn shame when you look at how miserable people generally are in this world."
275,OP did a bad job covering up his attempt to seduce his gfs mom.
276,"that's exactly it.  we weren't there.  we didn't see how lustful OP was when he grabbed her friend, compared to when he grabbed his gf.  she may have even been okay with it when she said she was okay, but as soon as she started seeing how aroused he was by it, she immediately became self-conscious.  she may have assumed it would've looked passionless, like porn, and that he would've then pulled out and taken her to reaffirm she was ""better,"" but he didn't... he kept nailing the friend for another 5 minutes after she'd left the room...  


she clearly signed up for something she wasn't ready for."
277,"You know even if it wasn't a video call and the girl couldn't hear the insult, seeing your kid's girlfriend for the first time and calling her ugly is fucked up to your kid. Why would someone do that?"
278,"&gt; Like how did the question of ""Is this okay"" not even come up until they were already all in bed together naked, about to get started?

There's this crazy thing you can buy now that reduces your inhibition and often leads to poor decision-making. It's some chemical you drink and it comes in a ton of different flavors. The name escapes me at the moment."

285,"Just remember that here in the UK marrying your first cousin is legal, so I'm pretty sure the sex must be too."
286,"he should be more coy about it. ""I think our chemistry is off"" or something like that"

Source: studied in France in college and was amazed to find that a Canadian movie that was playing in France had to have subtitles! The French is very different. I had a job back in the USA where we had clients in Quebec and I couldn't understand anything they said.

Regardless, this is one of the funniest TIFUs I have every read and I admire your commitment to ""Keep Calm and Carry On French"""
297,"I worked for a little person manager in college. At one if the weekly staff meetings we (a bunch of chill college kids) were talking about goofy cereal mascots, the Trix rabbit, Captain Crunch, et cetera. The manager opens the door in a huff and shouts ""I am NOT a leprechaun!"" 

""Um, ma'am?"" says one of the workers. ""We were talking about cereal. Lucky Charms. You know...the mascot. Not about you."" 

It was awkward."
298,The best part of these ceremonies is the meal after with your family.
299,"Same. I always told my ex that I'd be down for a threesome. Somehow she understood that it was okay and that I would like it if she kissed her lesbian friend in a party that I wasn't in. What? Why would I be okay with you kissing a person behind my back? The whole point is for us to enjoy it together. At least ask me if it's okay before hand. We weren't in an open relationship.

But I forgave her, apparently she was only experimenting and realized that she was completely straight. Still doesn't make it okay to cheat on me. She said she only ""kissed her"" but who knows what really happened? I sure don't. I wasn't fucking there. Even if it was only a kiss, it's still cheating.

If I were to kiss a guy behind her back, she would consider it cheating. So why is it okay for her?? 

Yes, I'm still salty about it."

310,"Yeah, threaten the other guy by telling him you‚Äôre sending over your Reddit gang to beat him up."

Why I‚Äôve only had one in my life and it wasn‚Äôt with a bf. I don‚Äôt think I could ever watch my bf fuck another woman. I would also break up with him immediately, but I‚Äôd never get in that situation in the first place."

315,Hot
316,Only if you want them to blow you.
317,"That's rough... The thing is, it doesn't matter how ugly or beautiful you are. Looks change, they fade, they evolve. Some people are fat, tall, short, skinny, ugly, beautiful, have a weird face, head, or other weird looking parts. The chick from transformers has a really funky looking thumb. 

The point is, there is absolutely no reason to feel bad about yourself for being a little different, it makes you unique. Besides, if you think she's attractive, that's all that should matter to her in the end. But it does suck to have someone say you're not cute.

FYI: I had people tell me I was ugly in school because I was overweight. Guess what? I can lose weight Karen, but your parents are still divorced and you still have crabs..."

349,"I dunno. Second cousins? I think maybe go for it. The situation is pretty fine, genetically speaking. It's not like you were raiaed as family, so no weird past. It's legal ... I think everywhere in the U.S. And you're in love.

This is maybe one of those things you shouldn't let social taboo decide for you - especially considering the taboo in question doesn't really apply to you."
350,Makes me think of the other thread on here now about a dude whose SO is into MMA and he keeps getting dirty looks because people think he's beating her up. I'd hate to think of the dirty looks you get dating someone others incorrectly perceive as a child.
351,"First time my husband trimmed our daughter's nails, he clipped the skin. Five years later he still feels bad about it for pretty much the exact same reason.
Funny part is that now he's still so careful cutting nails, that she asked him why he was so careful and he told her. So now she keeps saying ""remember that time you cut my finger and made me bleed?"" Guilt all over again."
352,"K so SHE can have sex with her friends in front of you without asking, but you are drawn in, ask if it's okay, and then she flips out? There's a serious imbalance here. She's done you a favour by breaking up with you. Don't be hard on yourself by believing you're the one who fucked up. Maybe she thought she'd be okay with it and discovered she wasn't, but for her to pay that on your shoulders is unfair."
353,So hold up a second. You went a few dates with her and this guy was your buddy for at least a little while I assume...how did you not know their last names and put 2 and 2 together?

358,"Lol selfishness at its finest. My bf and I were at a party once and we were playing truth or dare and it of course ended up with me making out with the only other girl in the room. The girl ended up dating one of the guys there after that and they once hit me up for a threesome and I had to remind them I‚Äôm in a relationship and they tried to accuse me of cheating for making out with her and my bf had to step in and remind them that I asked my bf if it was ok and he said it was cause it was just a game and for him two girls isnt the same as him or I making out with the opposite sex. I mean, I get it but I also have a lesbian friend that hates that common attitude cause it devalues the actual worth of *real* lesbian relationships and tbh I‚Äôm fully onboard with her line of thinking and my bf and I have avoided situations like that since just purely out of respect for ourselves and for people like my friend that think that shit devalues their own feelings and relationship. Also, my bf and I r much more serious now so, it‚Äôs also changed."

It's more disconcerting than you might think. If someone has some sort of obvious condition that makes them really short, or is just really out of proportion, then you know how to handle that.

But when she looks like she should be a runway model, except everything's shrunk down by 50%, it's Uncanny Valley time. It's easy to feel like YOU somehow grew by 50% by drinking some Alice in Wonderland potion."

373,OP dodged a bullet tbh
374,"Ha no, it was too embarrassing to stay, but me and my SO left together and talked it out. We discussed that it wouldn‚Äôt be right, as his family and him are very religious, and yadeyada. He wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it, and ultimately he ended it :/"

376,"Whatever you do, just don't tell them you were looking for a hummer."
377,Did they keep it in the family?
378,"Yeah I would've just been ""oh hi I was drunk lastnight, sorry.""

10 months is a long enough time that they can figure out you aren't a weirdo even if the first interaction was odd. But 10 months of complete lying? You might as well move now."

My gf said she would be all about it, but I wouldn't be allowed to touch the other girl...of course, this never happened in real life, but just to argue 'fariness', I questioned why it would be acceptable for her to take part in it but not me.  this was a while go, but I think her only argument was, ""because it's ok for girls to do it, but not the guy and another girl"".  Needless to say, the hypothetical situation turned into an argument, and not because of this argument (it was a culmination of many different arguments about many things), but that's sort of how the relationship went (very lopsided), I gave up and left her.

Edit: Within the specific argument, I suggested that I would not touch the other girl, but would want to still be involved, at least with her...she said no to that also because (I don't know) selfish reasons."

Help!.......Help!"" and she sounds like a person, so people have called the cops saying a woman was being held against her will there. The first time, the cops showed up, searched the house, then met the parrot and understood. So they leave them alone now. The parrot's name is Jeffrey, btw. They didn't find out Jeffrey was a girl until they'd had her 20 years."

530,"I hope this doesn't get too downvoted, but second cousins aren't too related to marry and have kids. In fact, about 10.4% of relationships worldwide are that close or closer.  There is no data that children of *second* cousin relationships have any worse health outcomes than strangers. By the time you are second cousins, you are nearly as related as strangers.

Here's a nice meta analysis done by FiveThirtyEight about it: [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/)

You may still feel weird about that relationship after reading this, but it's mostly just from the intense social stigma that people (mostly Americans) place on incest. My point is, **you don't have to break up for fear of problems in your potential children**. If you are going to break up, it's only because society has an outdated view of second cousin relationships."

546,"my grandparents live in another state, so I can't just stop by their house whenever they need something.  


I speak to them on the phone every Wednesday evening without fail - 90% of the time it's a half-hour conversation about what some lady at church said or a ridiculously detailed explanation of what they had for dinner, but it's worth sitting through just for those few calls where they casually mention that the gutters are overflowing and Grandpa's going to get up on the ladder tomorrow to clean them or something else that puts the fear of god into me and that I wouldn't have heard about if it weren't for our weekly chats.   


They'd never dream of asking for help, or calling to say that they're struggling with something,  but they let things slip in our weekly calls that let me know when I need to interfere (either by flying up there myself, or booking a maintenance working/cleaner/asking that lady at church to sort something for them)  


definitely can't underestimate the power of a weekly chat!"
