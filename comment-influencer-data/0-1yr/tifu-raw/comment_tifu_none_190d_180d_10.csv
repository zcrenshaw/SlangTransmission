10,"I had a similar experience: Dad and I went to Hooters for the Superbowl when I was 14. (Dad wanted to be the cool dad that day) 

They were having a drawing for a brand new TV that night. Dad and I saw a table with the box and entry forms on it so we both went over and filled one in and put it in the box. A couple of fuck ups occurred:

1. In order to enter, you needed to be 21 and buy 2 beers first.
2. I had horrible handwriting skills at the time.

We watch the whole game and time comes for the winner to be announced. They call out a name that sounds eerily similar to mine...no one comes forward. They call it out again and this time my dad's brain starts to churn and realizes he probably chose my entry but couldn't read my handwriting clearly. He goes up to the organizer while they are waiting for someone to come forward and explains the issue. The organizer tells him I needed to be 21 and have bought 2 beers. My dad apologizes and explains what happened. The organizer gets a good chuckle, pulls another name (not my dad's) and we leave empty handed.

12,Well I don’t know if it was addiction level but when I had lots of stress in my life I had to constantly drink water. It can be dangerous if you drink too much but for me it was like I had to have some every half and hour or so rather than huge amounts. And I would wake up to drink water.
13,Freedom diabeted.
14,"Lol nah fuck that.  Your Dad fucked up.  Though I do have to ask.  If you had put his name on the ticket, knowing full well you were only doing it because you were underage, who would have gotten the car? Also:  Did your dad put in a ticket?"
15,Your archnemesis. 
16,Sugar should also be classified as a drug.
17,I swear 1 pump is equal to 3 or 4 packets of sugar. I tested this when I worked at McDonald's as a teen and soon discovered the result of 5 pumps VS 5 packets. Ooo boy.

35,"I mean, it is? They have to make the thing you order. You know how many times people order dumb ass things and then get pissed when it is made to EXACTLY HOW YOU JUST REQUESTED IT. There is a reason they usually repeat the order back or double check.   


Like if someone came in and ordered a coffee with 17 sugars I'd be pretty normal to ask if they're serious or ask if they actually want 17 sugars because that isn't normal and insane people will come back and flip shit about how they actually ordered 7 sugars or something and now they're coffee is undrinkable."

Really shows how ludicrously large American cars are compared to UK/Euro cars, although ours have been creeping up in size as well - the new BMW Mini is considerably larger than the original.

The Mini was one of the first post-WWII cars in Britain that wasn't some shitty little piece of three-wheeled crap, but it was still tiny because metal was _expensive_. It ended up being a surprisingly good car - so good in fact it won multiple rallies.

... which made it an awful lot of fun to have as a first car."

60,"No, I don’t know anything about your past, just your attitude of use supposedly self-deprecating humor to (hopefully unintentionally) put down a minority that is targeted and harassed and is having laws passed in my home country to make their lives harder. It’s incredibly frustrating to see a part of my community be put down for a joke where you, a supposedly cis man by the context of your pose, are trying to make yourself the butt of it. 

I think... and I’m saying this quite seriously, you’re putting the trans modifier before the person. Saying you might not have a lot in common with them, well that’s true of everyone, right? Most trans people’s lives do not revolve around their trans identity. Yes, it may feel like it because they put it in their bio or whatever, but consider the fact that cis men have killed women before when they discovered their junk didn’t meet expectations and got away with it. 

People are people. You and I may not have a lot in common. I don’t know a lot about music or sports, but I’m an avid printmaker and I love dogs and fish and going on hiking trails to take pictures of trees. I love to read and write. I also happen to be a trans guy. I’m just saying, don’t scratch off a woman just because they were misgendered at birth. You can build up some really solid friendships if nothing else. You may even find that your hands off method of support was actually really limiting towards your understanding of things like gender identity, sexuality, and how trans people live. Things you can never really glean from a 2k article about the LGBT laws being enacted. 

As for your issues with your wife’s sudden polyamory. I’d suggest sitting and thinking and making sure you’re really comfortable with this. And if not, why? Is it because you’ve not yet had success? I’ve seen a lot of poly couple crash and burn because they didn’t remain honest and communicative the entire time. I’m sure your wife would want you to be open with her about any discomfort or insecurities you’re having. 

Have a good day. "

141,"Just doing a bit of quick math and referencing...

&amp;#x200B;

A litre of water can hold up to 2000 grams of sugar before becoming saturated at 20 degrees celsius.

A typical sugar packet contains 2-4grams of sugar.

A typical coffee beverage usually ranges from 12-20oz.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming the smallest reasonable beverage of 12oz or 0.354L, you could dissolve up to 708 grams of sugar before the coffee became diluted (if the coffee was at 20 degrees celsius). Assuming a packet of sugar is 4 grams, 17 packets of sugar would equate to 68 grams, far below the saturation point. 

&amp;#x200B;

 While it seems nay impossible for THAT much solid to be consumed by a limited amount of liquid, the sugar is being continually suspended in the water. And as it turns out, the saturation point for water at 100 degrees celsius is over 4500grams per liter. (That's crazy, I didn't even think it would be that high).

Weeks later, my boss had to call AT&amp;T about the account.  They asked the security question, and he turned to ask me what the answer was.  I told him ""Hooters"", and he gave me a look like ""god dammit"".

He asked me why the hell I would set his security answer to Hooters, and I said ""Hey, I promise you'll remember it when you call next time!""

And he did.  He never changed it."

Planning a little weekend vacation to a new city to stay in a hotel and hook up sounded like fun. We talked about past relationships, shared our sexual history, and I felt comfortable enough to agree to the trip. At the time, it was the holidays and being single can be a downer. Being stressed out from the holidays, work and my family, I wanted a little escape. I enjoyed talking about us hooking up and imagining meeting up at a 5 star hotel to fuck. We were having a normal conversation (I don't even remember the topic tbh but wasn't sex) when I noticed you were stroking yourself on facetime. I instantly felt weird because it stopped being a fantasy  for me and shocked me enough to feel creeped.  It made me rethink things and the $250 plane ticket felt way too expensive with how I felt. To give you credit, we were talking about sex a lot and I don't think you are a creep or anything. Not looking for a pen pal and decided to peace out.

protip: don't do this.

all nighters can work for some people when doing papers, it does not demand any more effort or attention once you're done.

however, when doing an exam the most important time that you need to have energy is *during the actual exam*. it's extremely counterproductive to drain your energy right before it starts.

the little bit of extra cramming you can squeeze in is more than offset by your diminished mental capacity. it's more important to get a good night's sleep before an exam.

335,"Let me guess, you changed it to Biggus Dickus."
336,"It's not even tea at that point, it's just fucking sugar water. "
337,Wasn’t it schlong dong? Or maybe it goes in both ways?
338,I read this as “dog schlong” at first.

340,Honestly nobody is gonna guess that
341,"As an American, ordering anything and asking for liquid sugar is a concept that is blowing my mind."
342,"This reminds me of a story I watched unfold lol. I worked at a small amusement park in a small town and I had a few coworkers that would come over to my house to hangout and drink after work sometimes. We’d tell stories of the crazy customers and how we know them ect. 

We invited over the new guy B from our department. Everything is good and one girl S starts talking about the crazy customers we get when the park does holiday sales. The moth before was a veterans day special, S is telling a story about this mom who came in and misunderstood the special was for veterans only and she was demanding the special ticket pricing for her ticket too because her son was a veteran and he served his country and just kept yelling when S tried to explain the special. 

So it turned into a wheres your manager situation, and at the end of the story S adds ugh that lady is such a bitch. We all are laughing and agreeing and then B says yeah that was my mom. Everyone fell silent, but It was cool he laughed about S point of view especially after working there lol. He still came around a lot after that too."
343,Was it Michael Scott? 
344,i see you've never been and/or known a real addict...
345,Ehh I don't see it as making fun of him when he questioned black coffee...  Unless instead of your simply implying that adding sugar is crazy to you.
346,"Does anyone know the sugar-sweetness conversion rate is for tea Vs coffee?
"
347,OHMYGOD
348,Addiction doesn't mean you guzzle it to the point where you die. It means you need to keep consuming it habitually.
349,In what way is sweet gritty milk and unsweetened cereal the same as sweet cereal in normal milk?

352,She doesn’t know it’s your dick per se. Whether or not that’s a good thing is up to you.
353,"I have LOTS of sugar and creamer in my coffee. Question: do you mean packets of sugar or sugar squares/lumps. Because the packets come with a literal bit of tiny fuckall, but the lumps? Yeah 17 is a lot. "
354,"Come to think of it, his name was- it was you. Damn."
355,"For whatever reason drinking coffee with milk makes my stomach go funny and I get cramps. I drink milk tea an ungodly amount as well as sometimes milk+protein shake for breakfast. It's not a dairy problem. I find myself drinking cold brew more often than not. Energy drinks seem to not work anymore while a cup of black coffee will make me feel 250% even straight after a all nighter (how I discovered this). 

I think I need a better sleeping pattern above all else.

Yours sincerely, some stressed af uni student. "
356,"I had a similarly weird experience at a Barnes and Noble with my fiancee.  She asked me to run her purse out to the car, so I did so at a rather brisk pace because I wanted to get back to the section I was looking in ASAP.

Well, in doing so I passed some **True Gentlesir**, who saw a roguish miscreant (me) hustling off with a purse - clearly the property of a distressed damsel.  He decided to try his hand at vigilante justice, just like in the Marvel universe he loved so dearly.

**""Stop!  Drop the purse!""** he shouted at me as I approached the car.  His katana may have been at home, but the strength of that high-carbon Nippon steel flowed through his blood at that moment like the fire of Mt. Fuji itself.

Of course, I thought he was trying to rob me, so I yell **GET THE FUCK BACK** and strike a fighting pose that would make Goku himself get the shakes.  (I've heard that is a Japanimation character, which I am making a reference to in order to seem relatable.)

At that time an employee and my fiancee come rushing out to explain to Gentlesir that the purse isn't stolen, and thankfully no ki blasts were thrown that day from either of us."
357,Ask your wife again if we can see her ass picture. We need it or else this story is fake news.
358,"If it continues to be a problem, contact an administrator at your school, and let them know that you submitted a written request,  and that you feel all students are being punished for it. Perhaps mention that you felt uncomfortable speaking with the coaches, and that your elation afterwards was because you had the courage to hand in your proposal. Remind the administration that the coaches are making money to support the school's sport programs by selling snacks, and childish retributions will only hurt the school.  If you ever want to get anywhere in life, you need to learn how to play politics. This is an excellent chance for you to make your FU one of your wins."
359,Splash zone seats maybe?
