1,"""ITS MY TITS.  DON'T LOOK.""  Let me know how that works out for you.  LOL"
2,Deleting my account now. Need more random name.
3,Don‚Äôt let her get away dude. She‚Äôs swallowed your piss
4,"Block the gap in the latch with a piece of paper that says ""No Dad"""
5,"I am not even 19 and I got worried. Then he said ""girlfriend"" and I knew it wasn't me."
6,Do i need to chase her down and take it back?
7,"Tell him your GF is taking a shower, but instead you're in the shower having a wank."
8,"My boss ""What did you do at work all day?""

Me ""casually refreshed Reddit for 8 hours for the slim chance to see a strangers boobs"""
9,Get revenge on him.  Peep on his lady in the shower.
10,"We found my friends moms dildos (quite extensive collection) and we chased each other around his house with them.  I think we were 12/13 and there was about 5-6 of us.  The game stopped when one touched someone‚Äôs mouth. 

So it could‚Äôve been worse?"
11,"&gt; In reading through the comments he‚Äôs made to others, I‚Äôve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

The other stuff will fade. This is what matters most, the rest is just window dressing."
12,"*Update: if this gets 666 upvotes I‚Äôll post the photo.*


Welp, see you on the front page."
13,"Sounds like the start of a weird porno, guess we will find out in the update"
14,And people say romance is dead
15,Damn dude...just damn
16,All the 19 year olds scramble to see if it's them
17,Hey... it‚Äôs like shouting ‚Äúno please stop‚Äù to someone stabbing you. You gotta try.
18,I thought it was common courtesy to warn someone they're on speaker?
19,"Hey the upside is the rest of the evening when you farted you left a trail of ""Lilac Breezes"" in your wake."
20,"Welp, RIP OP's inbox.

&amp;#x200B;

Nice tits though."
21,Block the keyhole with a photo of Bran staring.
22,He actually did it
23,We were about 16-17 and found my friends moms vibrator. Someone dropped it and it broke so the son was scared he would get caught snooping in his moms room so he took it to the garage and fixed it. So we nicknamed the garage the dildo repair shop and called it that for the rest of high school
24,Just blocking keyhole would be good. He wouldn't know if you or she did it and he would shit himself.
25,I think this is the best. Your girlfriend says loudly she's going to go shower. You sneak in and just start wanking furiously whilst looking at the hole. He'll never look through again
26,"This is impressive. Similar story, my sister had always been obsessed with getting the best TV resolution possible, always getting the latest thing. At 28 she finally went to an optometrist who determined she actually has terrible vision. When I asked, she said she just thought everything was kind of blurry for everyone."
27,"If he's an avid redditor, I can't imagine he couldn't figure out that you're his Dad from this post. Poster beware..."

33,"The bad kids get coal, and the *super* bad kids get their dick stolen."
34,at least you didn't learn that he fucked the dog or something
35,Don't judge her based on her family. The fact that she would have that occasional giggle in front of her family with them knowing what she was laughing at says she's a keeper.
36,Got to say bravo that is hilarious. Also gf is a true diamond for seeing the funny side.

46,Is Myth busters still around because I‚Äôd like them to check this out.
47,Excellent tl;dr btw
48,"Haha, i made the same joke to her in bed last night.  What fucked me up was that i smelled it before i put it in and it smelled like cinamon/spices/etc and I thought i remembered the bombs being a similar flavor so it all jived in my head."
49,"Seriously. When I answer my phone, it goes like this: 

""Hello \[sister\] YOU'RE ON SPEAKER AND MOM CAN HEAR YOU.""

People always think I'm weird but like........ if it prevents something 1/10 as bad as this FU just *once*...."
50,I learned about this after it was too late.
51,"Why are most posts here about how they fucked up by having something bad happen to them?

It wouldn't surprise me if we soon got posts like ""TIFU by getting cancer""."
52,There is a greater than 80 % chance he is jacking off to it now TBH.
53,"üòÇüòÇ sounds like the appropriate time to end the game.

55,I once sent a picture of my cock to a group chat with my mates on accident.  Your breasts are much nicer and would have been much more appreciated.
56,Coworkers wanted to see a dog and saw a bone instead.
57,"No, apparently it was the GF that is into the weird stuff."
58,"Man these towels are hella soft, but DAMN do they smell funky! Lol. Awesome."
59,"Hahahaha honest mistake. In fairness if she is going to be looking at a camera in your bedroom she should have checked it first. 
Embarrassing none the less."
60,REPLACE THE DAMN LATCH AND FILL IN THE HOLE Your dad will know why &amp; you won‚Äôt have to sit in your bedroom and watch every time Which as others have pointed out will be impossible to do your entire life
61,"Bitch, I'm reloading it!"
62,To get the funk out of towels use white vinegar in the wash.  About a cup.  Works better than detergent.
63,Congrats reddit we've done it and op delivered like a  glorious saint.

65,yah he did a summer course in dildo repair

67,Camera in your bedroom sounds like a terrible idea
68,Must‚Äôve got a text from sister. You up?
69,You're only human
70,"I set alarms to play with my noodle and don't notice people easily

Do I seem that smart to you?"
71,Yes. You‚Äôre going to need to follow her around with one of those little pee cups on-a-stick for dogs. Wait for her to pee and continue the ritual.
72,You think I can afford steak?
73,"it‚Äôs basically a public diary, if you‚Äôre going to look through someone you knows profile proceed with caution or don‚Äôt look at it at all"
74,that's not very cash money of you
75,"In 2019, all family meetings are conducted via open letters on reddit. Contentious issues are now dealt with via throwaways instead of at Thanksgiving. Family members who frequent t_d are still shadowbanned from the real parties, however."
76,"Shit's on the line when you get outed.

I had an account that I had used almost regularly for 3 years and deleted 10 minutes after I realized that my brother had figured out my username."
77,"That's her bad for not cutting you off sooner, surely she could see where you were going with that."
78,Are we not talking about the boyfriend in quotes?
79,I agree with you. We‚Äôve actually been together for a long time and have laughs about her family. She is the woman for me!
80,I‚Äôm a woman of my word.
81,lol He wears clothes now. My wife made sure to talk to him about penises and vaginas and I had to excuse myself to go laugh my ass off. I‚Äôm a grown ass man but every time my wife or my son said penis and/or vagina I lost it.
82,F
83,Better grab the crossbow just in case
84,.....aaaand this is why you create a throwaway account.
85,"I had a friend like that too.

He was a couple of years younger than me and was getting ready to start learning to drive. We got talking about what the test involved, and I mentioned there was a sight test. I told him you had to read the license plate of a car from a certain distance. 

I pointed at a car across the road, just to show him how easy it was and not a big deal. He squinted at it for a moment and then asked 'what, that one? Right over there? How are you supposed to read that?'

Turned out, he had really bad distance vision and hadn't ever realised."
86,She tolerates me! :)
87,Sounds exactly like the kind of excuse a public masturbator would use.
88,"I did the exact same thing for years.  


I always bought the same lavender smelling 'detergent'(actually softener)


I loved the way my clothes smelled, but they weren't always clean.  I always thought I had a shitty washing machine and never gave it anymore thought.  


This lasted for years, until I got married.  The first time my wife was doing the laundry she asked me where the detergent was.  I said 'babe - its right by the machine', she like 'I dont see it'.  I go over there and point it out to her.  She started laughing....and laughing...and laughing.   


To this day, she still makes fun of me anytime she remembers about it."
89,I mean you could just go buy steak and whiskey and try it yourself. It's not like you're blowing up a car or something lol
90,Soon does he wear clothes now? Also him thinking that's how there are girls will f*** him up real good in the future!
91,"Seriously. Realized she swallowed his piss but seeing as he didn't know seemed fine with it. This girl will provide much fun in bed and if loyal, in life too."
92,If he's eating your ass he's your boyfriend
93,That drip must taste great
94,That‚Äôs what M said.
95,You're a squirter now. There's no going back.
96,I'm actually not even sure myself. 'CP' was on the list of 'Forbidden words' and 013 could be assumed as the age? I'm no expert üòÖ
97,"My oldest daughter asked me where cats came from? I told her they came from Ohio. 

She goes, ‚ÄúHow do you know, daddy?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúIf you lift up his tail, there‚Äôs a big O on his license plate.‚Äù

She bent over, lifted his tail, look at his butthole and goes, ‚ÄúHe IS from Ohio, daddy.‚Äù

She graduated with a double major in Psych/Sociology and just started her master‚Äôs program. 

He‚Äôll work it out."
98,"Well, at least you can‚Äôt get mad if anyone called you a dick."
99,"If you think your kid(s) haven't snooped through every nook and cranny in the house, you are naive lol. Got some secrets hidden in a dark corner of the attic/basement. They've been all through of it."
100,"Yeah, that sealed the deal most likely."
101,"My grade 8 classmates (all boys) and I found a pink dildo under one of our hotel beds when we were on a field trip. Half of us were so confused, the other half of us thought it was hysterical, a giant 12 inch neon pink penis isn‚Äôt something you always find under a bed. I remember we chased each other with it, even slapped each other in the face with it when the other person wasn‚Äôt looking.. Looking back, who knows where that thing had been.

We kept this thing in our hotel for two days until we finally told our teacher, which ended up getting us a free room for the night. I still laugh when I think about it to this day."
102,Atleast she wasn't pissed off......just pissed on
103,Then posting the pic on Reddit üòÇ
104,"What do you mean, ""he repaired it""? Can he fix any electrical object or is he just particularly accustomed to dildo tech?"
105,Yeah I whack it in order to go to sleep:/
106,"I actually lost it at ""lost my appetite"" lol. Nice."
107,"As an established man of 41 who's had the sex a few times and pissed at least a few more times.

I need to know how these two events got confused. 

Do you orgasm when you pee? If so, high five!

Or is cuming just a release of fluids? If so, poor bastard.

Or am I some weirdo?  If so, I can accept that."
108,"&gt; why didn‚Äôt you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?

114,"I feel lucky now, Didn‚Äôt have sex last night due to girlfriend having upset stomach but we were dying laughing about the thought of what would happen. Seeing this today made my morningüòÇ"
115,"Eye doctor here.  Women who have color deficiencies are fully genetic genotype (X)(X) where the parentheses indicate the color deficiency gene.  This means that one of two circumstances must be present:
Dad is (X)Y Mom is (X)X - 50% of daughters express color deficiency and 50% are just carriers
Dad is (X)Y Mom is (X)(X) - 100% of daughters possible are Expressing color deficiency

I‚Äôll tell you a funny story of a male teenage boy in my office one day.  Most of family was in my exam room, including Mom, Daughter, teenage son (not the patient), younger Son (patient).  During the examination of the younger son, I determined he was color deficient, severely so in fact.  Older brother bursts out in laughter, mocking him at his new diagnosis.

I stop the exam there, look at the brother square in the eye and say ‚ÄúThis is Genetic.  And by the way, your pants are green, not brown.‚Äù  He looks back at me incredulous and says, ‚ÄúShut up, they‚Äôre brown!‚Äù

The family burst out in laughter, apparently they just thought he had funky fashion sense.  The pants were green."
116,Don't put yourself down. We all enjoyed that picture.
117,"When i got my learners permit to learn to drive i had to get an eye test (everyone does) so I walk in thinking it'll be fine, I've never had any vision problems, optometrist asks me if I ever had any problems, i said no, they do the tests and then turn to me and say ""the only thing normal is your colour vision"".

Turns out 3D movies are not supposed to give you a headache or make you dizzy.

Turns out you are supposed to be able to read things more than 5' away.

Turns out you are not supposed to get double vision after a long day.

Turns out you are not meant to have extremely blurry vision after you wake up.

Turns out your eyes are not meant to be sore after a long day.

Turns out things are not meant to jump left or right if you close one eye.

Turns out my mother also needed glasses."

135,"I said the same thing (even though I'm the one suffering the embarrassment). She blamed the sisters; said they were shushing her from the moment I asked her to call me ""sir"". None of them knew I was gonna go that far though. Which is still no excuse of course."

It sounds like you‚Äôd like to put your own discomfort above her being a victim of something horrifying like this. And it IS horrifying, to think someone you trust is spying on you when you‚Äôre NAKED in a sexual way. It‚Äôs incredibly fucked up and you need to step up to the plate and handle this."

189,I consider myself lucky that my wife shared in the fuck up because she definitely would have rightfully laughed at me haha
190,"Holy shit (hehe), that was wild.

Now you've tried it once though, I strongly advise you to not do it again. Enemas don't do anything for you, unless you are severely constipated or something. By using an enema you can actually flush good bacteria out of your body, which can lead to other awful things like maybe IBS (as an IBS sufferer myself, you don't want it. Trust me.).

Also, it doesn't cleanse your body. There is nothing harmful to cleanse. Your liver and kidneys do all that work for you already. Don't fall for the 'health scam' again.

Not trying to be annoying, just wanna raise awareness against these unhealthy 'detox' methods. Be safe :)"

229,Already sent to the guy I‚Äôm flirting with. Accidentally sent to the guy I‚Äôm just friends with.
230,"Granted, it's not a fuck up in the traditional sense. But I wish I hadn't looked and double checked, because ignorance here would've been bliss. But at the same time at least if I know I can take steps to stop it happening again"
231,Maybe she was calling her friends to come watch
232,Real FU is gf tbh
233,What a crappy situation. If your relationship can handle this im sure you can handle all the shit that comes on your way.
234,"Protect your girlfriend from your dad. It's harassment to spy on a person while they are naked and unaware. Most women, and men, would feel extremely violated. Your dad will probably keep doing things like this from my experience and may build up to more uncomfortable experiences for your girlfriend like inappropriate staring and prolonged hugs.üòû"
235,"Upvote for ""fuck it, we'll just do it live""."
236,"Damn, just flirting gets you boobs these days?"
237,Show them the feet fetish to hide his horse fetish. It's genius.
238,"Yeah, things that go in your ass shouldn't be half-assed."
239,"I remember being on 4chan one night and someone posted a link to a website where you could literally access random people's in-home security cams, petcams, any camera connected to the internet. You could even turn the cameras side to side and up and down. Even play audio through the built in speaker in the cam (if it had one) such as music or even your own voice. Ever since I saw that was possible there's not a snowballs chance in hell that id ever consider putting one of those fuckers inside my own home. Keep in mind this was just a clearnet site than any random person could access if they had the URL. Like I said I don't remember the name of it but I think it had the phrase ""cctv"" in it. Scary shit."
240,OP needs to return the favor make it an even playing field
241,and pissed in üòÇ
242,Honestly being twelve and able to build something that complicated is pretty impressive I bet you could make a better one now though.
243,How tf did you go through your teenage years thinking that was still correct.  Surely something was off right?
244,Because for some reason he refuses to bend the knee.
245,"I was my wife's first date, around that same age. We married six months later despite our families saying we would be miserable (never take advice from miserable people) and we've been married 21 years this August. Sometimes, the world was just waiting for you."
246,Like distilled essence of Tennessee!
247,"I would definitely call him out on it. Don‚Äôt be a dick about it, but 100% make it clear that you are suspicious of his behaviour. Something like ‚ÄòI‚Äôd really appreciate it if you didn‚Äôt hoover right outside the shower while my girlfriend is in there, because we both know you can see in, and I‚Äôd like to believe that sort of behaviour is beneath you‚Äô

Telling your girlfriend is a tough one, and probably depends on how serious your relationship is, and how well you think she‚Äôd take it. My general feeling though is that you should, after you‚Äôve spoken to your dad."
248,"I can get behind this method..

262,"If this is OPs son, I can't imagine the level awkwardness right now."
263,"THANK YOU!  OP I know it sucks to realize your dad is a pervy fuck who jumped on an opportunity to violate your girlfriend‚Äôs privacy but he *violated your girlfriend‚Äôs privacy*.  Intentionally, repeatedly, and as soon as she was vulnerable.  That is the type of man he is.  It‚Äôs on you to a) do something about it, b) protect your girlfriend from further violation by telling her what you saw so that she never fools herself by thinking she‚Äôs safe around your father‚Äîshe‚Äôs not, and c) extrapolating this shitty revelation into the realization that sexual assaults and other forms of violations are committed by all kinds of people, in all kinds of brazen ways.  You have to tell her OP."
264,"There are those pictures of giant companies and their humble origins at garages

265,"My gut tells me that this story is either BS or the ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù didn‚Äôt tell the truth about how he got so drunk. I could go on for a while about the holes in this story, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do, I‚Äôm going to buy two steaks. Soak them in Jack for 48 hours. Then I‚Äôm going to grill them for 3 minutes per side. Then I‚Äôm eating one of the steaks. I will report back on flavor and buzz.

Lets set some standards for this test."
266,I fucking love you
267,I'm just laughing at the idea of your husband taking so many toys into the kitchen that he forgot one and didn't notice. In my head it's just like armloads of dildos.
268,Why comment on the porn at all on this account?...
269,"The only way you have fucked up here is by framing standing up for your wife as losing money. You absolutely did the right thing.

I've had money, and I've had a wife, both are gone now and I have never gone to bed missing the money."
270,"Alright, let me.get this straight. Please, correct me wherever I say something that's wrong.

Y'all spent Friday night together, as well as the day, I presume. Y'all spent both Saturday and Sunday night together, as well as both days. You also repeatedly say ""We got home"", rather than ""we came back to my place"" or ""came.back to his place"". You always refer to it as a home, and that you both come back to it.

I mean, you may not wanna define it, but I'm willing to bet my paycheck for tomorrow that you know good and well what you want to define it as.

Trust me, if the man is meat whiskey drunk at work, and his first thought is to video call you so he can tell your pretty face that it's pretty and to not eat the meat whiskey because you could die, the man cares about ya. Bring it up to him, and thank me after y'all share the second meat whiskey together"
271,This was legit the most mindblowing thing I've learned in at least a year.
272,"You went from not showing wanting to show your tits to one random dude to showing your tits to 25,000 people -- and you have identifiable tattoos..."
273,"&gt;Fear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of...

You had me worried there for a second lol"
274,"Just don't talk about it if they don't mention it. Parents tend to just not talk about these things and do their best to try and forget it, but if they do start talking about it then I guess it's up to you how you handle it."
275,"""You have a penis!""

""Well, not anymore...""

An actual conversation I heard at church a few weeks ago.

Our church has a trans woman who is hilariously open about herself (sometimes to an unnerving degree, although she's open about ALL her medical issues so you're as likely to hear her complain about a recent colonoscopy as you are to hear how her breast implant is trying to escape.) and we have a wee congregation member who has recently learned the names of body parts.

I think her mom was the most upset, she kept stammering and we finally managed to piece together that she tried to explain what a sex change operation was and that ""Eve"" had one. Which resulted in the kid thinking Eve has a dick. She does not, trust me. I heard all about it when it was remodeled."
276,"You'll have to post the rest of the convo including accidental photo.
10% of it doesn't quite cut the mustard if you want us to fully understand your mortification."
277,Whatever lies taste like.
278,"Not even. I just didn't have reason to question it. In fact when I learned that snorting things do in fact have a faster effect on the brain it made even more sense. And I was in a situation growing up where I had to be pretty independent so I never had to ask or be supervised when it came to taking medication. For the most part I knew what I was doing, except apparently Goodies.

And like I may have mentioned already, the shit taste like hell, I'm still not comfortable consuming it orally so I just stick to Excedrin and Tylenol for headaches."
279,I was only trying to send the hot sauce story! I mean.... my rule is never send anything you WOULDN‚ÄôT want on the internet.  But I‚Äôm good for my tits being on reddit for now.
280,Maybe they already suspect he is a sexual deviant so he has to give them something to throw them off the bigger trail.
281,How can‚Äôt you tell the difference between needing to bust a nut and needing to piss
282,And that's what we appreciates abouts ya.
283,/r/buttsharpies hopefully
284,Wait what happened here. You sent one person accident tits and the decided fuck it send it to the internet?
285,I'm good with your tits being on reddit for now too...
286,One letter just changed history.
287,Just make sure you don't have a sister
288,"The only fuck up you did today was not calling out your Dad. I guarantee he's done this before. He knows about the hole, he knows about how the hole can be utilized, and he has a cover action (hoovering) developed."
289,"Can confirm, been a nosy fucker myself at this age.."
290,Shits so dumb lol
291,"The fact that he was hoovering at that time despite no need, moved off as she left the bathroom and from the sounds of it hung around for a while is an awful lot of coincidences.

If you look at it from another perspective, he purposely went there knowing she was in the shower, thought enough about it to cover it up with the hoover and hung around shows quite a lot of premeditation. 

It doesn't sound like he accidentally came into the opportunity and was to weak willed not to look.

I am trying not project here but let me just say that I ignored warning signs with my father 'he isn't that sort of person' 'he is just a harmless old man' 'things were different when he was younger' and well, let's just say, he wasn't just a harmless old man.

Not saying that's the case here, but that is definitely really very concerning. I would tell your girlfriend and ask how she wants to handle it, after all it was her that was potentially violated. Doubt she would be happy if this came out later."

306,"Even with the TL;DR, I don‚Äôt get this. You drew a dick, showed your gal who laughed because she‚Äôs got a sense of humor and likes ya.. Her dad took a jab at you after you swapped your pic, and now you‚Äôre thinkin‚Äô you wanna bail?

I grew up in a super conservative family, but we could still make jokes. If he wasn‚Äôt joking? They‚Äôll get over it. Your girls a keeper, bruh. Her family is probably hella cool too..

341,"If I may jump in w/ a PSA. *Please* teach your children anatomically correct terminology included vulva/vagina and penis. AAP has been recommending this for at least a decade, probably longer, and repeated studies are showing that there is a reduced incidence of sexual assault among children who use anatomical vocabulary versus other made up words.  

*Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more
vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names
for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and
sexuality (Elliot, Browne, &amp; Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75
children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their
different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer &amp; Vaughan, 2000).*

343,"We didn't find out that my son was colorblind until he was 18. He had a really outgoing personality so everyone assumed that the hot pink and orange shirts and crazy patterns were just him being extra. I always found it unusual because nobody else in the family likes loud colors and so his taste was unusual. Once we found out he was colorblind everything made so much sense.  


A few years ago he stopped in to surprise us by making us dinner. Steak and trout with sweet potatoes. He and I shared a steak. Now my kid was notorious for being terrible at steak. He could cook anything else like a trained chef, but he just sucked at steak. He served it beyond rare. Practically raw. Sometimes still cold and with zero sear.  


This time he was poking at his half of the one he was sharing with me. He frowned and shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this turned out so well done. I didn‚Äôt think I overcooked it.‚Äù  


I lifted an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThis is medium rare. For once, it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù  


‚ÄúMedium rare! Mom! This is well done! There‚Äôs absolutely no pink in here at all!‚Äù  


I looked at my steak with bewilderment as the red juices flowed onto the plate.  


Then I shouted, ‚ÄúJames! You‚Äôre colorblind! Remember?!‚Äù  


You should‚Äôve seen the look on his face as years of steak arguments clicked into place. He let out a soft, ‚ÄúOoooOOOooh...!‚Äù  


And that's the story about why my son bought a meat thermometer."

Dad will be absolutely wrecked, knowing you‚Äôre onto his creepshow and realizing you‚Äôve outsmarted him. Forcing him to see his fully-grown son in the nude is just an added bonus; that mental scar will never fully heal."

421,"Depends on how cold the body is at that point.  Worst comes to worst, there's always the microwave."
422,"It doesn't sound like your were fired it sounds like you quit which if all the points in the message are true you did the right thing. 

Start job hunting now. You will be back in work before you know it!!"
423,All the 17-21 year olds scramble to see if it's them
424,"If you use fabric softener, yes."
425,"OP: having a wank
Dad: that's my fetish
OP: Am I joke to you?"
426,"I found my mom‚Äôs dildo while looking for my birthday present once. 

Had some good games of Halo 2 that day."
427,"heh

428,He is risen
429,‚ÄòCame *while realizing* she wasn‚Äôt alone.‚Äô
430,"Less TIFU and more Today I Learned that it wasn‚Äôt meant to be, better now than years down the road when you‚Äôre both bitter and hate each other.

College life will keep you busy and hopefully give you some better chances at finding someone better suited for you."
431,One time in middle school I went to stay the night at a friend's house and when I came home the next morning my parents were still asleep and there was a large orange DOUBLE-ENDED dildo on the coffee table.  I went straight to my room and stayed there for several hours and when I came out the dildo was gone and life was normal again. It was never spoken of.
432,SHAZAM!
433,This sounds awful but a part of me does actually want to try it.
434,"It's just linux, man ...

man cp 
man touch
man unzip
man fsck"
435,Yeah this is my biggest fantasy. Lucky girl
436,cant get nudes leaked if you post them yourself üëâüòè
437,Could you tell me more about this SCP thing? It sounds interesting but now i'm mildly concerned about searching for SCP on my work-computer. plssss i want to read some mysterious thingys.
438,"My mom had a package of the little wax squares that looked very similar to what I‚Äôve seen my boyfriend use while cooking.  I looked at it and it said ‚Äúlemon basil‚Äù.  My first instinct was ‚Äúah yes, this would be awesome on the chicken I‚Äôm making‚Äù. Luckily I asked before I used it though. I feel your pain."
439,"Nah man, ya poor down the back of your mouth,barely taste it"
440,RUM HAM!
441,"Listen...  licensed massage therapist here.  This therapist was very unprofessional.  You were not there for sex....  Also, LMTs are trained to deal with this type of stuff.  It's actually more common than you think.  Hard-ons are autonomic, meaning you have no control over them.  They happen ALL the time during massage....  And I've not had a client cum on the table, but it happens more often than you know.  Instead of being understanding, she embarrassed the shit out of you!  That is unacceptable in my opinion."
442,"Why do people share their personal info with total stranger on the net? Why do they user their main account? And lastly, why don't they purge their history at regular intervals?"
443,"Text from mom, how are your arms feeling hun?"
444,The need to fap (or Schlick) at 3 am runs in the family I guess.
445,"I had no idea meat drunk was a thing, and I desperately want to try it now.  Maybe make some tequila soaked pork and make some tacos."
446,"""Eh it's only something I do to pass time ya know?"""
447,"Well, that'll teach ya!

Now casually drop his reddit username over family dinner and watch his reaction."
448,"I got jalapeno hands/lips and ended up setting my lady parts and my husbands junk on fire.  I had it much worse and sat extremely unladylike in front of a fan, with 3 ice packs on me and cried for like half a day.  I can honestly say, the brain stops working because I put an emollient on it thinking it would like, help sooth it.  Nope, barriers do what they do and it sealed it in so it was actually hot to touch."
449,"Totally accurate sentiment, bad example. The woman who pioneered the power posing stuff is now actually a champion of replication studies in psychology. She's admitted to p-hacking to achieve some of her most famous results. But like I said, the idea overall is very accurate. Behavior drives belief as much as belief drives behavior."
450,"Yeah, but the volume is different. Not enough to spray on her chest and still get a mouthful.

So for OP, plausible but highly unlikely."
451,CP means copy in linux. I don't know what kind of fucked up boss you have to think of CP as child porn without any additional context.
