4,"Aside from outbursts when an adult fails to honor a contract... not really seeing a huge problem here.

Kinda sounds like maybe the primary lesson might be for the teachers to stop taking the easy route and making dishonest deals with kids; which they have no intention of honoring, in order to get the desired behavior out of the children. That the other children are either not developed enough to detect the dishonesty, or too timid to speak out against it, should not excuse dishonesty.

At the very least, being dishonest with the kids is sending several subtle messages to the kids on subjects such as ""teachers (authority figures) cannot be trusted"", etc."

Then one day in second grade, the teacher was reading a story, and in the story, someone opened a business in a neighborhood.

45,"Yes. 

Early on me and my husband made an agreement to never lie or trick our kid. It is a matter of trust, and we think it will pay off in the now fast approaching teenage years.

We have never lied to him. We may say ""this is not your concern"" or ""This is too complicated to explain right now, let's talk about it when we get home""or even ""because I am your parent and right now you need to trust me on this, and ask questions later"". We also simplified things to age appropriate explanations.

But we never, never lied to him.

When you handle these types of media every day it's easy to forget that it's not public, and it's owned by companies that care A LOT about controlling access to it.  Typically, we don't allow any internet access to any machine that has access to the assets as this is a security requirement from the studios.  I'm guessing that the company that subcontracted this work is going to be in some hot water for allowing you to access it from home in the first place."

First night there, I offered him one and told him that they were pretty potent, but he decided to eat the whole brownie.

Just tell them you feel really terrible and you don't know what it is (don't mention the drinking). They will run some tests, and probably eventually conclude that you have some kind of virus and tell to you just wait a few days to see if you feel better. But, you have documentation of going to the hospital now.  

Then, you update to say that you are a little better, but still feeling bad, and you call out of work the next day too.  This sells the lie about being sick the day before even better.  Someone's who hungover may call out one day, but probably only someone actually sick calls out 2 days.

188,"Next time externally say (not scream), ""Thanks, that's good enough.""

Even better, just ask them.  ""How much ham do you think I'd need to make X sandwiches?""  Alternatively, just go to the packaged meat aisle and visualize the amount of meat in a given weighed package.  Then go to the deli and ask them to slice it if you want.

FWIW 2 pounds is probably good for 8-16 sandwiches depending on how much ham you like in them.

Also $13 a pound is really expensive for ham...even good ham.  You should aim for paying half that at most.  For example I can get 2 pounds of Columbus ham at Costco for $11, and that's the good stuff.  

Edit:  Quit filling my inbox to tell me it’s Canada because picture and kg.  The original post made no mention of Canada, says pounds, and they edited their post after mine and added the image.

Wouldn't the CEO have better things to do than attend a presentation? Why couldn't they come to him? Everyone knowing he blew the meeting? Just how small of a company is this?

As an adult, found out I had ehlers-danlos syndrome, which causes dislocations and is often associated with gastro issues, slow healing and MCAS.

271,"Edibles are really crazy, and my wife and I learned the hard way. I've been smoking since I was young, so I have a tolerance, but my wife was not much of a user. She got her med card here in CO before it was recreationally legal, and would buy this CBD oil, which was mostly CBD, but had plenty of THC in it. Well, it came in this syringe, and we had no idea how much to take. She asked me to take some with her, and I wasn't interested. Edibles were always wasted on me, never potent enough. HA...

So I decide I'll take some with her. It's a 5ml syringe, and we each take 1ml around 8pm. She goes to bed, I fall asleep on the couch, only to be awoken by our new-ish-born daughter around 1am. I get up there, take her out of bed, calm her, and my wife walks in with a bottle, looks at me and says, ""I can't do this. I'm so fucking high right now. I can't walk. I can't sleep. I can't be here. I need you to do this."" To which I responded by just staring at her, then she walked away, I fed my daughter, and got her back to bed. As I'm doing this, I realize that I'm really super stoned. Not like, ""I can't function"" stoned, but just really really stoned. Then I start thinking backwards and realize I said nothing to my wife. Not a word. I was so out of it, I didn't even realize it. Got my daughter fed and swaddled, and rocked her back to sleep. I then happily trotted my ass back to bed and fell right asleep. It was a wonderful slumber.

Next morning, I wake up, and my wife is like, ""never again"". I then tell her that I realize I said nothing when she came in and gave me a bottle. She laughed, I laughed, the CBD oil laughed... I was overly impressed, as I had never been so affected by an edible of any kind. Eventually I figured out that I could take 0.4ml and it was awesome. 1ml was WAY overkill. I'm unable to find that stuff anymore, but wow. Holy overboard. Seems like the #1 problem we have here in Colorado with edibles is that people don't understand their potency, especially in relation to their own tolerance level.

edit: Spare me the ""that's irresponsible"" nonsense. In 2012 it was not well-known that over-consumption of edibles would go so badly for some. That's something we all started to learn in 2014 after retail centers opened up. The state even changed edible laws last year in an effort to curb child consumption and over-consumption."

273,"I was in touch with the jeweler who made the ring this afternoon. It will basically cost the same to make the new ring out of the old one. I was also in touch with my neighborhood jeweler and we're meeting next week to talk about turning the gold and some of the diamonds into a small pendant. I thought I could do that for now and just buy a new ring once we have the money. I'm worried that my husband will insist on getting the ring now that he's finally ready to buy a new bass guitar he's wanted for so long. Knowing him, he'll get the ring remade with the money we have set aside for the bass, and I do not want that to happen. "

275,"One night, my wife was getting ready to go out with an acquaintance, and said acquaintance was driving. Wife was trying to cut back on her drinking, and opted to have a little weed instead, before they leave. (She likes to pre-game, my wife.) Something possesses her to make her very first edible.

She gets all the shake she has, and cooks it in a little butter on the stove over low heat. She takes out a single crostini. She tops it with an artichoke heart and a lil parmesan, drenches it in the butter, then toasts it in the oven. She eats it as she gets dressed, and they depart for the bar. 

Time lost all meaning. The 2 minutes it likely took for them to find a parking spot in the lot was reportedly four hours. She spent the evening so high that she wasn't sure whether she was actually responding when people spoke to her, or just making facial expressions in super slow motion.

All I could do after coming home from work was stand there and try not to cry while clenching my fists.

I eventually got over it, nail polish is still there. On hot days I give it a go and try to peel it off and it comes off without taking the paint of the vehicle off, little by little I'm gonna remove that crap.
