0,I'm sure posting on reddit about his small penis will improve this TIFU situation immensely.
1,This is such a good way of writing TIFUs
2,"&gt;nobody fucked anybody that night

That’s clearly untrue, you fucked yourself."
3,Now just tell him at least it is bigger than his best friend's to try and comfort him.
4,Man I hate it when I accidentally become a school shooter.
5,I just counted a strip of staples. His story checks out.
6,"Damn man, that's some heavy shit. Straight up ""My Strange Addiction"" territory."
7,"MY grandma was on the receiving end of something like this once. She was sitting at Walmart waiting on my grandpa when some other old guy opened the door and said, ""I'm back, dear."" (Or something to that effect.) Then sat down.

Grandma looked over at him and said, ""You're in the wrong car, darling.""

The guy jumped at the unfamiliar voice and started apologizing profusely."
8,"""here I go killing again"""
9,"&gt;Got distracted on the road when I noticed a naked homeless man chasing down a dog who had a visible dildo in its mouth.

You think your life is bad? Imagine the weekend that guy must have had to end up in that situation."
10,I guess there were two bodies sent to the morgue that night
11,"&gt; There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I’d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I’ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

Find someone who looks at you like OP looks at a strip of 211 staples."
12,"Hey, first I hope you feel okay soon. I can't imagine what it's like, but I know it must be hard.

Maybe you don't want advice from some random person on the internet, but I listened to an interview with a psychological traumatologist recently, and they suggested that engaging your brain with something totally unrelated within 24hrs can help stop flashbacks and related symptoms of trauma. Specifically, Tetris was found to be very effective in helping people who had undergone traumatic experiences because of how much it engages the brain. They also found that talking about the experience made symptoms worse.

I'm not an expert, but I am repeating what I remember from someone who is. Hope I could help"
13,Holy fucking shit
14,Wild ride. Ending threw me for a loop. 10/10.
15,Don't start down that road...  You may not come back
16,It makes you wonder how this would have ended if the lady in the wrong jeep had said yes.
17,I don't really consider him a friend anymore--that whole outburst was very unexpected and totally uncalled for
18,"Cary, IL? I pass that station every day. I heard a woman was hit there this morning. Sorry to hear that you had to witness that (even if it's not the same one)."
19,So much time being saved
20,"This is the most thoughtful approach on this thread. Everyone is else is focused elsewhere, it's nice of you to be thinking of OP's boyfriend.

OP this is the best solution, by far."
21,What a dick friend you have there.
22,Did you confuse Singapore and Thailand?
23,"Considering his personality is a solid 1, I think everyone is out of his league."
24,"That sounds like a good idea, he best friend is taller and buffier, this will cheer him up!"
25,Cup of ~~Joe~~ Gary
26,"My wife's friend shaved her nipple off in the shower once. Yup...clean off. 

I guess she had hairy nipples."
27,You haven't caught me yet though bitch
28,You are so lucky most would never be able to walk again. Hope you played lotto after that stroke of luck

34,"Rule 1 - do your research about a country before moving to it.

Rule 2 - if you’re trying to get a job, don’t do anything for free, or that’s all you’ll be taken for, a freebie 

Good luck man"
35,You didn't fuck up. You got fucked over.
36,Staples. Not even once.
37,"Yup, thats the one."
38,"I guess if your girlfriend really loves you, it can become a good story 'how we got married' you'll once tell your children"
39,It is amazing how avoidable this whole situation is haha
40,"I love how if you don't have a big one, you have a small one. There is no in between."
41,"Similarly, my husband thought turkeys were male chickens lol"
42,TIL some people clean their magic erasers in the laundry. I’d always just put them in a sink full or bucket of warm water and squeezed out the dirt. Or bought a new one after too many uses.
43,"Since you seem to know your way around a box of staples, what's your favorite brand? Is there a size you prefer you prefer over the standard issue ones? Are heavy duty staples particularly satisfying to break apart? 

Bro, you can't just drop a staple addiction on us and then not give us a breakdown of the pros and cons of various types"
44,"My god, I didn't even think about it this way, lol."
45,"When I was in school the drills were always surprises. During the first week of classes each teacher would run you through the plan for that specific class room.

Your school clearly needs the practice. Kids who screamed just have away two classes"
46,"""It's just the one Swan gender, actually"" - OP"
47,"I just spent quite a few minutes of my life trying to find out whether fish have receptors for capsaicin (the spicy chemical). Birds don't, and that's why birds eat chilli peppers and spread their seeds by pooping (which is good for the plant), but mammals are deterred from doing so. My verdict is that your fish probably didn't suffer much.

1)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061104/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061104/) 

These wacky researchers injected the lips of codfish with either saline, 0.005% capsaicin, 0.1% capsaicin and some other things. The low dose wasn't significantly different from saline, although the 0.1% capsaicin did have an effect. I think your fish experienced much closer to the low dose of capsaicin. 0.1% is like the concentration in a strong heat rub cream.

2)  [http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/chilies-shark-deterrent/](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/chilies-shark-deterrent/) 

Mythbusters tested the myth of using chilli peppers to deter sharks. The sharks bit through balloons filled with habanero concentrate and were not deterred. 

So I hope this puts your mind to ease and hopefully your fish is fine."
48,I will need this for my train ride home. Thank you!
49,No doubt about it. OP. You need help bro.
50,You're enabling him!

56,Had the same thoughts when he mentioned “criminally cheap massages”
57,"Come on man, just one strip till I get paid."
58,Imagine if it bursted open while he was chewing on it.
59,Sounds like fun. I would be back just to see how long I could play the game without getting busted lol
60,"&gt;one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that 

Ohh....  &gt;cringe&lt;"
61,"Well neighbor (I'm in FRG) it's good that you have a session planned already, but if you ever want to talk to a stranger about it HMU."
62,"There's only 1 way to fix this situation. Now you have to actually get a job there, without her knowing it, then show up and act like you've been working there the whole time."
63,But do you actually have a nice ass?
64,As a swimmer/former lifeguard this is one of my greatest fears. I'm afraid ego/comfort will get in the way of caution.
65,That's the kind of joke everyone should but almost nobody can tell to their significant other.
66,"""Hey Babe, i can explain..."""
67,"""And that's how I met your mother."""
68,"You probably have a superpower now.

Are you secreting abnormal amounts of goo?  

Are you finding an overwhelming urge to armor your back with various household containers?"
69,"Dude. Despite all the staples it seems your live is coming apart. 

Go see someone. Talk to a professional. 

The biggest red flag is the lack of control you describe. 

I’d also being asking the hard question of what this behavior is masking. 

It was a cool story though."

71,"&gt; Messages in the Spam folder are automatically deleted after 30 days

Uhh... thanks Google?"
72,"I thought this was going to be a story about your girlfriend finding it and thinking you had cheated. This is so much worse. 

Funny how your parents took you out of sex Ed for religious reasons yet they are using condoms."
73,"Fun story, when my brother was 13/14 he had the same thing happen. The thing is, he got his terms mixed up, most likely because he had been doing some soldering in tech class. So at our parents fancy dinner party later this week, he confidently declared that the doctor sodomized his nose."
74,"Take it from someone who has lived abroad for a long time, as long as you don't end up in prison, you're going to look back fondly on this adventure and laugh about it.   

You will also talk about the summer internship in some future interview, because while the work they gave you was very basic, you still learned a lot about adapting to new environments and dealing with adversity and new challenges.   

That being said, don't fuck around with anything illegal in Singapore, and you should probably work on going home soon."
75,"Hey I did this! Except I was 4, and I cut a massive chunk out of my leg with my mom's razor. I wanted to shave like a grown up."
76,Tell me about it. Just a simple “oh I think you’ve confused me with someone else”. But nope. That would have been too easy apparently
77,"You havn't seen a dude in 3 days after a thing with the cops in a foreign country?

Might be overreacting but if you know his name... Might want to drop by the embassy and get them asking about him."
78,Dude got greedy. Trying to upgrade a threesome to an orgy.
79,Hey man at least you didn't figure this out WHILE having sex.

82,Knowing what the word degloved means is one of my biggest regrets. I'm glad it wasn't worse for you!
83,Thank you. Seriously. Thank you! Cary Grove is so great the people just make me love it more and more. I may take you up on that if anything to grab a beer and get my mind off it.
84,"LOL, this reminds me of the time that I ...

wait, no it doesn't."
85,"Can you imagine if we made shirts with his picture on them and just sort of sat in chairs on his route? Like with some water or something? Oh, my mom just reminded me one time he cut his hair and it was super sad."
86,"holy shit, this better get more upvotes than the post itself"
87,I sent a reply now with the *tiny* hope that they're still keen on the idea. Just gotta wait another three months for a reply! (if I'm lucky). I'm just thankful that the manuscript was still attached to the email cus I've been through two different computers since then and the original is *looooong* gone.

96,"I have a small mole/skin tag in my armpit that kinda resembles a tiny nipple. For some reason it doesn't shave off, but I've always wondered what would happen if it did."
97,Hah... that reminds me of the guy that took LSD and then had to pretend to be French for 6 months before he was busted.
98,I’m sure deep down he’s super proud of himself to have people hype him up like that.

105,"Can't believe you didn't read anything about Singapore before you moved there? It's a famously orderly society with zero tolerance for drunk guys in a fountain type activity. Super expensive, but you can eat ""cheap"" in the hawker stalls, find out where those are. Check yourself before you wreck yourself, you sound like the kind of guy we'll be reading about getting punished for some stupid disorderly behavior."

131,"It was definitely both of them, and I called them both out for hiding the tips from me, and neither of them wanted anything to do with the confrontation.

 Just make sure that your other friend understands this and give her some time, i'm sure it'll be fine."
160,"Yeah it is kind of unfortunate, the ridiculousness of the situation leans people to think it is silly and harmless. But acting so shady that your wife and parents hire a PI to tail you truly illustrates how bad the actual problem is. I hope OP actually goes to get help. Even ignoring the potential thousands of dollars he spent, the lengths he went to satisfy this OCD level urge... troubling.

This is ""My Strange Addiction"" level addiction. Definitely hope OP at least ends up seeing a professional who can analyze the issue."
161,"Yeah!  Just last weekend I dropped an insane amount of acid.  Then I found this light saber and started flailing it all around cutting everything in sight to bits.  Next thing I know this wookie appears out of nowhere and wrestles it from my grasp.  I give chase to the wookie through this bright city when this tie fighter crashes into something off to my left.

What a trip.  Unfortunately now my apartments trashed, I can't find my dog, and my girlfriend is upset about something."

170,"We stayed and it was horrible. I personally left my laptop at work and had to go in and get it otherwise I would have called it a day.

The worst part about this is I called 911 right after it happened. Not for the incident but for the train riders. One strong woman was even trying to hail the lady to save her, she was trembling in a ball right after.  The police never came to us. The paramedics never checked on us.  The media was there to take pictures of us before the cops. The fucking construction workers working on the road were there for us. Commuters were there for each other! However the EMERGENCY PERSONAL IGNORED US!  Ive never felt so abandoned by the group my taxes pay for. Not only was that hard but seeing police officers just standing around.  

I emailed the chief of police this in a very long and hurt email. Also, took it to our towns FB page on the increased need for situational awareness in a technology-driven society and thanking the people of Cary for the support of their neighbors."

Started freaking out, also choked up a bloody clot about the size of a tomato slice, freaked out more and started crying. Crying=pressure, started crying blood tears like a friggin horror movie. My mom is freaking out, I'm freaking out, my brother is yelling at us to be quiet, he can't hear the TV. Mom calls 911, they're out of ambulances, so send the firemen. Me, ten years old in a ratty nightgown, immediately recognize hot men, stop crying. All the blood immediately stops, my mom embarrassed (also because attractive firemen), also in ratty bathrobe starts showing all the bloody tissues and the clot trying to convince them it happened. They offered to drive me to the ER, but since it stopped not necessary. Also got my vein cauterized. 

Ended my childhood habit of nose picking.

Started 15+ years of family jokes every time we see a fire truck, ""Oh someone's got a bloody nose!!"" (Laughter)

 Title : dick stuck I  the chandelier 

Didnt happen today but 3 years ago. 
 was the month of June. It was sultry hot. The sun was shining very brightly. It was right over the head. It seemed as it was raining fire. It was emitting flames and balls of fire. It was extremely hot. The day was totally unbearable. The creatures were gasping for breath. The house was burning with heat. The electricity had tripped. The fans had stopped. Now to remain in the house was quite intolerable. The hand fan was equally ineffective. The air was too fiery to give any relief. This situation compelled me to go outside in the open.


I went to the nearby Gardens in search of a cool breeze. But I was badly mistaken. There not even a leaf was moving. The earth itself was as hot as oven. The grass and tender leaves of tiny plants were all parched. Birds and animals were breathless. The street dogs were rolling in the slushy (muddy) pond nearby. Many a cattle was wandering aimlessly for a shady place. But it was the only thing which was not available anywhere. There was excessive heat on all sides. Even the shade of the trees was respiteless. I went to the nook and corner of the garden but there was no rest anywhere at all. I became greatly restless and feverish. Then I returned home. I felt my pulse. My body was burning. I was sick.


So I stuck my dick in a chandelier."
291,Oof. Might want to see a therapist after that one.
292,the way the dude described it... i had to. also i was horny
293,You already have an out if you go to that store in the future and run into the same cashier.  Just say they must be mistaking you for someone else.

Only to wake up and realize it was all a dream, now I had to get up, get dressed, eat breakfast and do it all again.

297,Brutal. Get well soon!
298,"I ended up in the ER with my brother for sort of the same reason 

after a night of heavy drinking, i woke up and went to pee and I kept feeling something laying on my tongue. I tried to touch it, I gagged. I yanked on it a bit, I gagged. I swallowed whatever it was and it was fine until I coughed and it landed on my tongue again. i check it in the mirror and see my uvula laying on my tongue. 

I ran out to my friend and I keep trying to tell him I need to go to the ER but I keep gagging. he's sitting there laughing so I run out to my car and text my brother then call him to wake him up so he sees my text. 

we get to the ER and they run all these tests on me but can't figure out what's wrong. it's not strep, it's not an infection or anything else; they're stumped. they say they will give me a penicillin shot and they'd send me on my way. before they could get back my either Googled the symptoms and asks me if I had been drinking heavily the night before. I said yes and he tells me it is just irritated from the drinking and the snoring and ice cream would take care of it. we leave before they come back with the shot and stop at sonic to get me some ice cream. the swelling was gone withing 5 minutes. 

turns out I drank heavily and was singing very loudly before I fell asleep and snored even louder.

now, to make this a bit more of a fuck up. I was at lunch with my girlfriend and my brother and I asked if he remembered the time my vulva was swollen and he had to take me to the ER. he asked me if I meant uvula. I got my words confused. I don't have a vulva. I'm a guy...

I later on found out that a decent amount of money was missing from the till and they tried to blame it on me saying that I had given too much change or hadn’t put the money through correctly or stolen it. I know that I didn’t do anything wrong as I served a few people with small orders and nowhere near the amount that they claimed I had screwed up or stolen.

The best way to diagnose this infection is to do a tape test. The best time to do this is in the morning before bathing, because pinworms lay their eggs at night.

Steps for the test are:

* Firmly press the sticky side of a 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) strip of cellophane tape over the anal area for a few seconds. The eggs stick to the tape.
* The tape is then transferred to a glass slide, sticky side down. Put the piece of tape in a plastic bag and seal the bag.
* Wash your hands well.
* Take the bag to your health care provider. The provider needs to check the tape to see if there are eggs.

**How to treat pinworms at home without a prescription:** If you found a worm and saw it move, you probably don’t need to see your physician.  Pinworms can usually be treated completely with two doses of over-the-counter medicine called pyrantel pamoate, available in the United States under the brand names Pin-X and Reese’s Pinworm Medicine.  Take one dose immediately and another dose two weeks later.  If you are having persistent symptoms (anal pain, abdominal pain, blood in stool, or rectal bleeding), be sure to seek medical care immediately.

**What prescription medications are used for pinworms?**  Mebendazole, also called Vermox, is a prescription medication that very effectively kills pinworms.  As of December, 2011, mebendazole is no longer available from any manufacturer in the USA, although it can be made by compounding pharmacies with a doctor’s prescription. No reason was given publicly for this discontinuation in the United States.  Mebendazole is still available internationally and is recommended by the World Health Association as an essential medication for a basic medical system.

401,"This doesn't look like you fucked up, this was a total win. Free milk for six years!"
402,Oh my dear. First I'm so sorry you were raped. Second good luck with the parents. You've been putting in the work; therapy and your support group. Stronger then you know.
403,*laughs in singlish*
404,I vividly remember the image of having the three little flaps of skin perfectly parallel to each other on the tip of my finger.
405,"GOD DAMN...

When life throws you a homeless man and a dog dildo and causes you to crash you know its trying to tell you something..."
406,"&gt;This FU happened about 6 years ago

Literally the first line"
407,As a married mostly sane (probably) person I can say that I think you are correct.
408,This was probably the biggest 180 spin i've read of this sub so far
409,This should be top comment. OP really needs to find his friend.
410,"Guy found pics on his gf's phone that she'd forgotten to delete of her sucking on her ex's dick. Bad, but not too bad right?

Except the dick was, and I quote, ""like two coke cans stacked on top of one another"". One of the pictures was of her comparing it to her forearm with an amazed look on her face. Big oof."
411,"My apologies.....let’s go with asswipe, ok?"
412,"Shit, i'm average at foreplay too"
413,"&gt;He should be killed instead. Beautiful creature innocently living millions of years ago then this monster comes along.


&gt;Disgraceful. No wonder dinosaurs became extinct. Sickos like this kill every last one of them as soon as they are discovered. He should be in prison

These ones might be satire but I'm not sure."
414,"It's crazy that you literally broke your neck, and first thought when someone mentions ambulance is the cost is to high.
Either way, good luck on your recovery."
415,"There was never going to be a perfect time to tell them, really. I think you handled it quite well, given the circumstances."
416,"I'm so sorry. That this happened and that I'm laughing. 

Feel better."
417,"

&gt;his posts on r/wallstreetbets.

Well that actually explains everything. He decided to YOLO his life and is in Singapore eating his tendies."
418,"You cheated. You didn't said ""the original is *loooooong* gone"" in this reply. I was trusting you."
419,"I don't know why, but this has made me laugh out loud. I can only picture the adults trying to process those 2 secs. puzzling about whether they think what they saw was it or not."
420,I'm dying laughing at this
421,"First of all, that teacher should have known not to send you out because there was going to be an unexpected drill where you and other students weren't aware of the situation. Because it will cause panic to you and others. Thankfully, nothing crazy happened and definitely you shouldn't be punished. 

It's crazy to me that there are active shooter drills in schools now where back when I went to school there was no such thing. But it sure is a good thing to know because anything could happen."
422,So did I. I’ve never washed mine but hey who I am to stand in the way of frugal old people.
423,anyone who believes this shit is a fucking moron.
424,"My experience tells me that if you hang around 3 or more dudes, it leads to stupid, dangerous behavior."
425,"Bahahaha, it was 6 boys and 2 girls so that might give credit to your theory lolololol"
426,Let's see if it pays off
427,"It's the mechanics, brah."
428,I'm heading to Singapore in a week and a half. I'll buy you a drink if you're still there
429,"Hahaha, as I said before I've been through 2 computers since then. So even if I used Word or notepad the files would be looong gone. I use Docs now cus I can access it anywhere and it's auto-saved to the cloud"
430,"I know I'm not the biggest dick in the world, but a tipsy redneck girl who wanted anal said ""Oh boss, back out! BACK OUT! I can't hack it!"" after we got going once like ten years ago, and my ego hasn't taken a serious hit since."
431,"I can imagine him going all Truman show. 

Imagine another family member sees him in public and goes “we’re still watching you, great job 👍”"
432,TIFU: my bf saw my TIFU about him seeing my post about his tiny dick
433,You guys are fucking ballsy
434,"What the hell, man. Op's post fucking died. You cant say stuff like that."
435,My wife has done this a couple of times. Something about hot shower water that just makes the blood gush like crazy
436,Something something broken arms.
437,This sub was doomed from the minute they started allowing sexual posts during the week
438,"My husband once told the waiter ""thank you for your service,"" if that helps."
439,Your kid will grow up to be quite an accomplished serial killer.
440,I [22M] came into my step-sister/cousin/half-sister [49F] repeatedly on the washing machine [7] while my cat [12M] watched.
441,"So these two girls are partying it up and going to have a threesome with you while their friend is crying about her dead boyfriend?  If anyone had a startling lack of empathy in this story, it's her friends that brought you there!  At least you meant well, in your piss drunk way."
442,Classic American
443,"My name is /u/Colitacoliecole, and I'm the slowest man alive."
444,Way better than the hyper sexualized fan fiction that drones on and on
445,"Looking back, totally worth it."
446,"Emergency personnel were there to do their jobs, not to comfort you. I understand it must be traumatic, but to expect them to cater to you rather than do their jobs is a bit entitled"
447,I'm mortified for you. How did that man not murder you? Lol
448,Don’t assume ones Gander.
449,Dude you might be number fucking two    Let us know what’s up with your CO levels
450,"I want to know what office supply store he went to. Was it...oh, I don't know...

STAPLES???"
451,That's it in done for today.
452,I agree. Though it may have been the alcohol clouding judgment as well.
453,"The first time I saw my boyfriend's penis, I excidedly said ""lets get you hard!"" 
It was hard. And it looked like my words reached out and just punched him hard enough to almost knock him over. 
I felt so bad."
454,"Time to change the name of this from ""The Major Tom"" to ""The Icarus"" because y'all motherfuckers tryin to fly too close to the sun."
455,"You know what she's called? 

She's called Incontinentia..... Incontinentia buttocks."
456,Also I want to see pictures of his used staple piles so I can see how deep I need to get into it to be pro level.
457,Wait does this mean birds have spicy poo?
458,"I saw that, too. After reading OP’s comments here, I think that’s a direct result of his email to mayor."
459,"Lol you're too kind.  If I gave you a chuckle, then I'm happy.  Please never spend money on reddit awards.  The people that run this site are bad people. I'll gladly accept your emoji gold.  :)"
460,"I appreciate all the comments sticking up to EMTs, we dont get a lot of slack these days. But, I will say, in the event of a traumatic code black like this, I usually peruse around and check up on everyone, make sure they are good. I'll say I'm not trained in trauma diffusion or psychological assistance (well, not to the full extent), but I see everyone on scene as a potential patient. The families need support, bystanders need help. Just how life is."
461,"The Major Tom post! I remember reading that thinking “oh boy this may become the 2019 tide pods of male reddit.”

Thank you for proving there’s nothing our great sex won’t do for a good nut 🤣"
462,Will OP grant permission for copypasta use??
463,"Yes.  So is the US. There are constantly protests there.  

The difference is Hong Kong people aren't looting and randomly hurting people. They have a valid grievance against their government and by extension (though not very far) China. Hong Kong is still an amazing place to be."
464,Except his dad lol Im straight up imagining that face of confusion and disappointment as he's shaking his head going wtf that's my kid
