1,"I have a big dog and purchased the same toy, but in a nice light blue. Never really thought about it, time passed. 

I’m flying my cheap amazon drone in the yard and get it stuck in the tree. I pickup the “dog toy” and toss it up into the tree. It gets stuck 20ft up in the front yard.... drone falls down later on that day on its own. 

Friend drops by a week later. “Dude, did you see the huge dildo in your tree?”

It’s still there months later. It remained firmly stuck even through a hurricane. Dozens of people have asked. Now it’s just the neighborhood dildo tree. "
2,"I woke up from surgery and I could feel something going on down there.   I told the nurse ""I think I'm peeing"", and she told me I had a catheter in and she could take it out now.   

I must have looked terrified, because she pulled back the sheet, looked and reassured me ""It's okay it's just a little one."" "

26,"I'm a grower, not a shower and the last time I had surgery that required a catheter I'm pretty sure the nurse taking it out was doing it (with supervision) for the first time and in my post op, post anesthesia haze I said ""I can make it bigger if it helps"".  

That was well over 10 years ago and I am haunted by that incident.  First, because I said it and second because there's no way I can remember their faces since I was so out of it but I'm 100% sure they remember mine...so I always have to live wondering if the lady next to me picking out bell peppers in the produce section remembers me as ""that one guy""."
27,"Given that introducing your son to Pokémon has given him the abilities of Pikachu, I think you should introduce him to Skyrim to see what happens "
28,"Hi, Uni-admin here,

Here's what you do; go to your program advisor, Chair, Director, prof, all of them.

Tell them what happened. Throw yourself on their mercy. Fall on your sword. Explain why you were ""busy"" was it work? Family? What? (If it was video games don't tell them that.) Tell them you simply ran out of time, that you know its entirely your fault, and you accept the consequences, but if there is any way they could accept a late paper, with penalties of course, because otherwise you won't graduate on time with the rest of your cohort, and adding another year of school is going to be a financial hardship for you and your family.

Promise to go to all the time-keeping workshops your school offers, heck, sign up for them NOW, say that you recognize this is only your problem and you're taking steps to correct it.

Do not show up in person, its the end of term, and we are soooo busy, but send an email and cc everyone. Good luck!"

31,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm 34M and I took my mom to Maui for a week long vacation earlier this year.  Pretty much everyone there my age was on their honeymoon, and I was walking down the street, going to dinners and luaus with my mommy.  

And I'm not shy about telling people!  Not sure if that's a good sign or not.

59,It is an actual condition. I know about this because it has happened to me. It has to do with your pelvic muscles going into spasm mode. You probably have a hypertonic pelvic floor because you carry your stress in your pelvic muscles without you even knowing. You can get it checked out with a pelvic floor specialist and go to pelvic floor therapy to relax your muscles and avoid any other experiences like that. You can message me if you have any questions :)

65,"The big smoke aka London, recently made famous by driving around eating smaller townships for reasons unknown to me as I wasn't paying attention to the movie."
66,"Ouch! But to be fair, we all occasionally blurt out things we don't really mean.  Maybe this story will help you feel better.

So, my wife is a non-native speaker of English and one time we were at the grocery store shopping.  I see this package of cocktail wieners that are super-sized--I mean, they're like 3 inches long.  So I pick it up and show it to my wife, thinking I'm being funny by saying, ""Hey honey, check out the size of these wieners.""

My wife glances at the package and without hesitation announces, ""Bigger than yours."" And continues on pushing the shopping cart, leaving me standing there just completely stunned.  

On the one hand, I was upset and wondering what I had done to piss off my wife.  On the other hand, the culture my wife comes from doesn't really do dissing or sarcasm, so I was hugely impressed that her English had developed to the point where she could deliver such a savage verbal beatdown without effort.  

So, I got over my hurt pride and told her how impressed I was at how her English was improving and she gives me this confused look.  I'm still holding the package of cocktail wieners so I explain how being able to deliver such an (admittedly funny) insult so quickly shows how much she's grasping American culture.  My wife looks even more confused and asks me to repeat back what she said to me.  I tell her and she doubles over laughing.

Turns out, she meant to give me a flirty, ""Yours is bigger,"" but in working out how to say it in English she actually wound up saying the opposite.  

So now it's a running joke with us that whenever we go grocery shopping together my wife laughingly says, ""Bigger than yours"" as we pass by the cocktail wieners.   "
67,"Unless she's allergic to any oils, it's most likely just the normal burning that occurs when that oil gets on any mucosal lining of the body.
I'd try using a neutral oil to dilute what's already on, using soap to wash it off, or a combination of both. Most likely though, it'll be something she has to let pass."
68,"This is on the right track. Your body only has so many ways to physically relieve stress, so if you were truly stressed like that your body may have triggered a mechanism to physically relieve stress because things weren't getting taken care of otherwise.

May want to take a cue from your body and focus on managing stress levels. It can be something that everyone struggles with at times, but remember that there are physical ways to provide some relief"

147,"Well, they do say misery loves company, so...

I remember when a buddy of mine ran screaming off of the field during (American) football practice because he made the mistake of putting one of those IcyHot patches rather high up on his thigh. See, the thing is that those were essentially the 1st gen of the patches, so they weren't exactly ready to take on high activity yet. As he put it through its paces, his sweat started to shift the patch, causing it to curl back onto his junk (both twig AND berries). The thing about football pants is that they're like capri leggings and they do two things: 1) Leave little to the imagination and 2) They damn near vacuum seal your bottom half.

With that in mind, it wasn't too long before he had the look of pure, morbid horror on his face which was quickly followed by him booking it to the locker room and ripping his gear off as he went. Later, we all found out that he had chemically burned his meat and potatoes and had to have the on-site sports physician (a rather surly woman) apply a topical cream to alleviate his pain/copious ugly crying.

For the rest of his high school years, he was given the nickname ""Hot Dog"" and I'm pretty sure there wasn't a single person who hadn't heard the legend. Thankfully, he was a good enough sport about it, although he did make the switch to Bengay after the fact.

212,They call it fire because it burns baby.  Maybe more of an emotional burn in this case but also maybe some stinging in the eyes.
213,Wow this has to be one of the most embarrassing and self-incriminating TIFU's I have read here. Though the mind boggles why you have a work colleague 'snapchat' group. If I want to communicate with my workmates I call or SMS them. Snapchat??!! Yeah I just don't understand without more context of your employment situation....
214,"I saw this happen back in '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abbie Hoffman telling everybody to steal books.

215,"Honestly, she left it on because she wanted to be able to fuck with you.  She obviously isnt stupid and knew the best way to mess with you was to do what she did."
216,But in case you get the icy hot on your vagina again (super bad luck I guess) don't go rubbing any lotion with vit.E on it. It may help reduce the burning hell but a lot of products are not meant for the vaginal flora and it may cause you other problems. Just check it before you use it too or you may end up with a few issues instead of one on your lady parts xD 
217,Probably my favorite theory.

229,"I just read about something like this happening recently in another post. If i remember correctly, lotion with vitamin E helps relieve the burning sensation down there. I forgot why but the ingredients in lotion plus mixed with vitamin E help sooth the burn. Good luck and I hope this helps

247,"You’re telling me 12” isn’t average? It has to be 18”. I swear the last time I checked 23” was average. That’s what the internet says, and you always believe everything you read on the internet, at least that’s what I hear from the internet."
