0,Well at least your teeth will be straight
1,What about calling the pizza place and asking for your delivery driver. Chances are he will give it right back especially if you throw in a few more bucks to sweeten the deal 
2,You should probably call in sick
3,"I suggest getting pants with pockets and placing your hands there. 

Edit: Depending where you are, flicking or pressing may still result in cops showing up. "
4,Anyone else feel bad for the girl that got repeatedly lied to and had her life put in danger because a college bro wanted to get laid? 
5,Yeah that's a pretty bad fuck up
6,"Damn, I once tried to get laid by pretending to be an engineering major and attending all her first year engineering classes so I could talk to her. She eventually started hooking up with the TA, but I ended up liking Engineering so much that I now have a Master's degree in electrical engineering. "
7,Honestly this is a funny memory. Make light of it every few years for some good laughs with the family. 
8,"Very plausible, and I'm a former delivery driver. We mostly just want cash tips. The occasional beer is great, but money helps with the gas. "
9,"I wish we could get the officer's side of the story.

""I asked this kid if he was okay, and he started running in circles.."""
10,"College aged logic: 

We have to do some elaborate, dangerous plot for a friend to get laid...by his girlfriend...after they’ve already been having sex."
11,OP is supposed to be gay and yet he posts 5 hours later about a gf. Gotta say there are some inconsistencies
12,"I've seen this movie. You have to lie and say you're actually gay and that's why you said it. Then tomorrow they'll hire a beautiful girl that you fall madly in love with, and she'll feel the same way about you. She'll see how you and Judith talk, so she'll ask Judith about you. ""He's such a sweetie,"" she'll say, ""it's a shame he's queer as a 3 dollar bill. You guys would be cute together."" 

The story progresses from there, until you ultimately have to admit to Judith that you were just a jerk and everything turns out okay in the end. And obviously Betty White plays Judith. 




Seriously though, that's a tough one, hopefully you guys work it out"
13,"She teared up?? Oh noooooo! The longer you wait the more awkward it will be to apologize, but if she teared up it may be worth the awkwardness. You can be honest without saying, ""hey you're old and I don't want to fuck you."" Maybe say, ""hey I noticed how you reacted to my joke earlier and I wanted to apologize if it made you feel bad that really was not my intention."" You don't have to explain why, just that it made you feel bad to see her get hurt. "
14,Did you at least get the donkey's number or called it after that night?
15,"Airport mistakes suck. This reminds me of when I was going to fly to Canada and meet up with several friends. I had our hotel, my flights, and the flights of 1 friend all paid for. And then on the way to the airport I remembered I had my passport in a box on its way from one state to another [I was in the process of moving]. So there was a sudden realization of ""I guess I'm not going to Canada""."
16,"Oh that's so sad. 

My first job was working at k-mart, I was 17. I had just gotten done my shift, logged out of POS, had bagged up my money and was about to hand it to my supervisor when a girl a little bit younger than me appeared in front of me. 

I told her I had just closed out and she had to go to another line, and she just squeaked out, ""please?"" at which point I noticed all she had was a pregnancy test. The other cashiers were all much older, men, etc., so she clearly came to my line on purpose because I was a girl around her age. She looked so scared and embarrassed, I'm tearing up just thinking about it now.

I logged back in to the register, sorted the money back out and rang her up. Every once in a while I still think about her. I hope she got the result she wanted and her life turned out okay.

edit: since I can't add more comments due to the thread being locked, I'd like to thank everyone for their kind comments and the reddit silver (I can't seem to figure out how to see who sent it to me and thank them directly, or else I'd do that instead.) It only took an extra 10 minutes of being at work, and it was just the right thing to do.

/u/SBiddy, I've also helped people with a couple dollars when they're in line in front of me and come up a little short, at least when I have the extra money to spare (I'm kind of poor myself). Again, it just seems like the right thing to do.

/u/newaccount721 when I used to ring people up for condoms, I always made sure you say some variation of ""have a GREAT night!"" because they obviously will be, and I always thought it was funny when people said it to me when I buy them. I hope that didn't make it too awkward, but it really amused me.

Once again, thanks for the kind words, everyone. I really do try to do everything in my power to make peoples' days and lives brighter whenever I can, even if it's just small things like that. It's just how I am, I guess it's how I was raised, and I believe everyone should do the same whenever possible."
17,"Just tell your boss you weren’t feeling well but thought you could make it in.On the bus you started to feel so bad you had to turn back without warning.

Not sure i would go into a lot of detail with a boss about this story lol"
18,Wow this is a true TIFU. Thank goodness you put the fire out when you did. You're lucky you're alive. Through everything you've been through it could have been so much worse. 
19,No but he did message me the other day saying I should probably get checked
20,"Swipe the pass

Wipe the ass

Say something crass

Shirts all trash
"
21,"yeah, this whole thing was very...cringey"
22,"It’s not like you went out of your way to step on it and spray him. I’m sure he understands. Try not to be so hard on yourself, you’re going through a lot right now. :)"
23,"Chill donkey deserves some credit here for not kicking the shit out of you, but keeping you safe and warm. "
24,"OP, strongly consider a caffeine addiction lol"
25,I would call pizza place and speak to driver.  Explain and maybe he will be decent and let you have it back
26,"Can’t believe they’ve turned you in to an ostrich, I hope this doesn’t affect your life too much. 

On a more serious note, I hope that things work out. Sometimes it may seem a little shit, or a lot shit but you’ve got to keep on moving forward and be you. Take it easy!"
27,"This story seems more like 'TIFU by adopting some dogs we couldn't afford to keep"".  

Then it's 'TIFU by buying a house without a real job or enough income'.  

Then it's 'TIFU by trying to pretend that my broken leg is not costing me income'. 

As you said - a series of bad decisions leading up to the current TIFU. 

I think you guys were abusing yourselves by taking on the new dogs.

28,Good luck finding them with women’s pants 😅

32,[deleted]
33,My friends had fun without me.
34,"OP and his buddy are also stupid as fuck, I mean they almost got them all killed for the sake of a lie to get bro laid."
35,"I did the same thing once when I worked as a Coca Cola delivery guy. I was in the walk in cooler at a store filling it and it was really dark but had a light on the ceiling so I started looking for a switch. Didn’t find a regular switch but found a little white box with a button on the side, figured that must be it so I pressed it... no light, annoying but I went on with my work. Moved a couple more stacks into the cooler and on one of those trips saw the light switch on the outside of the cooler. At this point I’m starting to wonder what the button I pressed was. Most walk-in coolers have a temporary fan shut off switch so that when you are in there you don’t have to deal with ice cold air blasting the back of your neck so I wasn’t too concerned. Went out to get another stack of cases and notice that the store is surrounded by the Sherriff’s department, K-9 units and all. The deputy in charge is talking to the store manager and as I’m walking out of the cooler they both just glare at me. Didn’t really get in trouble, I fibbed a bit and played dumb and said I must have just bumped into it, but I never did live it down. Store manager still busts my balls (jokingly, we got along pretty well) when I go in there and I haven’t done that job in a few years now."
36,"Holy fuck. No. No no no. Nonononononono. As one pilot to another YOU HAD SO MANY OUTS FROM THIS but you still let him put your lives at risk! Your licence doesn't even let you hand over the controls to another passenger! Damn dude, I thought we were supposed to be the sane and sensible ones with a safety conscious attitude!

Even if you wanted to do something that stupid and let him pretend to be a pilot, you had so many outs! ""Yeah we're going for a fly with another pilot friend of mine, just a casual cruise.""

I really, really hope you've learned from this mistake."
37,"So you feed the chickens after you choke them, got it. "
38,"They definitely won't let you forget this, so you might as well try and own it. "
39,"Remember the whole ""Aeronautical Decision Making"" from PPL training?

Yeah, you failed."
40,"On one hand your brother is hilarious, on the other hand your brother is an asshole "
41,"As a woman in her fifties I can’t imagine being hurt by a twenty something expressing revulsion at the idea of being intimate with me. I mean duh.  It’s not impossible I guess but obviously, it’s reasonable for him to feel that way.  So the fact that she called op on it makes me think she’s at least a little delusional and maybe nothing he says is going to fix that.  Having said that, pointing out that she’s old enough to be your mother and that you think of her that way seems less insulting than any of the alternatives. "
42,The whole story sounds made up. Tastes like dick? Even if my family knew I was gay I probably wouldn't tell extended family member something tastes like dick.
43,"To be fair, that sounds like something you should have been warned of."
44,"We can pinpoint a moment in any TIFU where a vital error was made. For you it was this:

49,"Hahahaha don’t sweat it too much! It’s an honest mistake and happens way more than you might think. The flip side is when the lil ones just walk right inside, uninvited. 

Ignores the candy and just pushes inside the door “Whhhoooaaaa nice house Mr.!” 

Meanwhile Dad is down the sidewalk: “HEY! HEY! ETHAN! GET OUT HERE!”

Sorry Dad, Ethan is now petting my dog 😬😂 

Original post: I had just gotten home &amp; my dad &amp; sister had the pumpkins lit &amp; the candy ready. I’m taking my coat off, getting settled when a little shadow figure scares the shit out of me walking up my front porch.

She’s all alone and really, really tiny. I walk down the hall &amp; open the door for her, Happy Halloween’s are exchanged and I go to reach for the candy bowl only to realize that I can’t reach it.

At this point I’m holding the swinging door open for her and wanted to avoid closing it on her/in her face so I asked her if she’d mind coming inside for a second...

She politely responded that she “wasn’t allowed to do that” and I realized the cringe-level of my mistake.

She quickly left and we haven’t had a single trick or treater since no doubt due to the amber alert warning out against my house.

TL;DR: Couldn’t reach the candy bowl &amp; scarred a young girl for life."

Shared this before but this post seems relevant.


I had a cross country flight that boarded at 5 AM, my GF stayed the night to drive me there and I treated her to pizza and beer.  Emphasis on the beer.  After tipsy packing was done, we finished off the rest and went to bed.  Blinked and it was time to get up and shower.

GF comes into the bathroom as I am showering and while I have told her about ‘the kraken’, she has never witnessed it.  The kraken is when your nether regions are completely soaped up and you let out a giant fart.  It’s magical, the moisture from the soap and water not to mention the lubricating properties of both adds this intense vibrato to the whole thing.

As she begins to brush her teeth I feel a tremendous beer fart begin to form.  I shout, “Release the kraken!”  And what follows is a good 8-10 seconds of chtulu like growling that just echoes out of the shower like a rude, rank voice from the deep.

She gapes at me, toothbrush hanging out of her mouth, trying to work out how to respond.  And that’s when the kraken’s kiss hits her full force.  Gently heated by the steam, the full aroma of the kraken careens into her like a runaway stink train.  She promptly gags and pukes in the sink.

This is also the story about me almost trying to find a Lyft/Uber to get to the airport by 4 AM.  At this point the whole thing is rather humorous, but I was in the dog house there for awhile for ‘flagrant spite farting’."
51,Thank you for being so sensitive and caring in her desperate moment.

67,"Pull the “you’re like a big sister”, which would be gross! And it’ll make it seem like a compliment- she’s younger than she actually is etc. Fact is, she knows she isn’t attractive which is why she’s making self-deprivation jokes and not assuming you’re gay instead of taking it personally. You don’t need to say “you’re too old” or “you’re not my type” etc. bc she knows that, women are brutally honest and harsh toward themselves. I’m not saying lie to spare her feelings, but stretching the truth like “you’re like a big sis” is a kind way of saying I’m not sexually attracted to you. Good luck, friend! "

OP doesn’t need to feel guilty, and she’s not necessarily delusional, it just could be one of those wrong word at the wrong time to the wrong person deals."
80,"I'm sure they have a system that tracks which driver goes where. At the very least, they'll know who was on a shift at the time.

Worst case is she tries to go to HR, which would result in someone like me rolling their eyes at her before calling you, getting the story, calling her back to tell her off for the sexual harassment, and then having to teach your whole team a ""Professionalism in the Workplace"" course.

I don't know whether our folks gave them money, but by agreement between the adults, we became their kids-of-all-work for the entire summer: walking mower, raking and carting yard debris, cleaning the garage, basement and attic, dusting, vacuuming, dishes, bathrooms, laundry, etc. For about 2hours first thing every weekday, they owned us, and while they were not unreasonable given our ages, (and they worked-with and/or supervised us on many tasks), they certainly got their money's worth out of us.

If it helps I think sleeping with a 25 year old man would be gross too. However even us old gross people don't like to be laughed at / rejected, even if we are usually not interested in 25 year olds, so I am sure she will appreciate a real apology. I still have sex with my husband of 25 years, HA and it is not too gross. In fact not at all!! Good luck OP."
139,You're a good parent for reinforcing that she did the right thing telling you. That is hard for kids. You handled it well but that still sucks.

And while I do think it likely you’ll get your challenge coin back, in the event that you don’t, would it help to consider that just as it came to you at a time when you needed it most perhaps now it is again finding its way to another person in need?"

145,"I'm completely on your side here. If the guy isn't the best, then he shouldn't be rewarded as such, just because he has a disability shouldn't mean he gets a sympathy victory. 

Especially when there is such a huge prize on the line. By the sounds of it, that could literally be a prize that helps set them up for their adult life with the scholarship. 

Okay fair enough the ""winner"" gave the first guy that scholarship, but keeping the rest of the prize is kinda shitty. 

The adults in charge should know better than to overrule and basically force you to change your decision, certainly didn't need to make you publicly apologise. They could have just said there was an error when they counted first. 

That kid needs to learn that life doesn't give handouts, and his mother needs to stop being a piece of shit. 

Sorry for the long reply, but as someone with various medical issues, including mobility issues, it pisses me off when people use their issues to get shit they're not entitled to. 

TL;DR I agree with you and fully support your decision and outrage. "
146,Said the dude who poops chainsaws pshhh
147,"When my parents were talking to a repairman about replacing their fridge, they were told to never buy one manufactured by a company that makes good phones. They said that those fridges are always over-engineered, and if they break you're absolutely screwed. I guess that applies to washers as well."
148,"Or take a note from Peter Parker. 

*Mr. Stark I don't^feel^^so^^^good.* "
149,Dude. The real TIFU is not quitting your job. Your well being is much more important than money.
150,"""then he fell down hit a fence crawled over the fence and to a group of donkeys where he finally passed out being spooned by a donkey. The donkey was cool, didn't mind the jackass."""
151,"I'm sorry man, I have no advice for you because I know every family is different. I came out to my very conservative family too. I was lucky though and had close relatives from the generation before mine who are gay as well, so things weren't so shocking to them.

What I can say, however, is that when you are a little older you will realize that this needed to happen. I never lived my life until after I had come out. I was constantly lying to my family about where I was, why I didn't come home many nights etc. In the end it hurt my relationship with them by having so many lies between us and I still feel like they do not know me fully. But it's been 5 years now that I came out and I can honestly say I wish I had done it sooner. It's like pulling a band-aid off, the initial shock is painful but after that it'll be ok, even if you have to make it ok yourself.

I do hope that you are ok and safe. Just keep your head up, it sucks that we have to come out but in a way I think it makes us stronger in the end. "

153,"The use of ""ambo"" tipped me off for it being aussie so I'd be surprised if it wasn't (4th paragraph in)"
154,"I work in a lab, they are the same test strips as the more expensive versions."
155,"haha I know!! even though it sucks it was at my expense, I'm glad some good memories at least came out of it! and drones are always replaceable"
156,"I feel like this goes slightly above ""today I fucked up."" Most TIFUs don't almost result in multiple deaths. I think OP warrants a Today I Almost Killed."
157,But did you get your washing out? 
158,"That's actually very shady to hear. At my old job we have to file an incident report if we so much as scrape our knee on the job, and I worked retail. 

Also the lack of concern your boss had for you after hearing you got struck down by god like the dog you are really tells me this dude is a terrible person let alone a boss. I'd 100% pursue another job in the mean time if I were you."
159,you know you’re getting a mirror for christmas don’t you.
160,"First, awesome sales rep. That's great customer service right there. Second, always listen to a commissioned sales rep when they say dont buy something because its bad. If they tell you to buy anything but that model, listen to them. They are literally giving up part of a paycheck to help you out. I worked in cellular sales for 5 years, and there were certain phones from well known manufacturers that I wouldn't sell because they were garbage. I would give the sale to a co-worker if the customer insisted because I couldn't in good conscience sell them something I knew would break."
161,aaaaand done
162,"Honestly, I don't really remember. In Ireland, during the summer months daylight will last until about 7-8pm. Then it'll get dark, *quick*. So at most I was probably laying there for about 30-45 minutes while everyone else was being fuckwits and didn't realise I was asleep. "
