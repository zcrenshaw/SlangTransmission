The adults were trying to get the kids out of the pool for pictures. First it was all of them, then the whole family, then they wanted to do just the Black family and then the White family. For context we're all white and for that matter the Black family are a bunch of blondes and redheads. Anyways, one of the parents was trying to get the most responsible preteen to go get the other side of the family for pictures. She ran to the pool and screamed ""all the Black kids have to get out of the pool so the White kids can get in!"" There was no music but I just imagined a record screech and the whole place stopped and stared at this seemingly horrible little racist girl.

It was a double garage with a few couches, a pool table, our pedal bikes and a spare fridge/freezer for overflow food that wouldn't fit in the kitchen fridge.

We smoked in that garage every day for years, probably 4-5 years. Always thinking we were so clever. ""The cracks above the garage door must let all the smoke get out, we've never been caught"".

We were at a family event recently and talking about how clever we were smoking in the garage and how we never got caught, in front of my Mum and Stepdad.

What OP actually did:

* Open up the android 'find my devices' page, select wife's device, clicked on 'erase device', ignored the 'All data will be permanently deleted from this device.' message and then clicked again on 'erase device'. Google will then ask you to confirm your identitfy (enter your password) before a final prompt of 'Permanently erase \[device name\]?'.

After feeling her up and down for a minute or two (t-shirt, panties, and no bra) I realized her tits felt huge. I hardly knew where I was at this point. Anyway, I kept rubbing on her boobs and working my way below until I realized there was no way her tits were all of a sudden that big and I had got into the other bed with her sister. The boyfriend had either passed out, or rolled out into the floor.

About a week later I had the haunting feeling that she could have been awake and thought I was molesting her and just didn‚Äôt say anything.

478,"Yea, but this is probably how it went down.

THIS_GUYS_A_PHONY's journal: 

First mold: Modeled after own dick.  Disappointed.  New mold needed.

Second mold: Went big.  Maybe too big?  There is no way you can hide a 28 inch crayon dick.  Put this one in it's own special hiding spot, back to the lab again on the mold.

3rd mold: 28/2 = 14.  14 inch.  This one was in purple.  I liked the length of it but something was wrong with the girth.  Was it too wide?  Maybe?  A color change might fix that.  Do they say black slims?  Maybe I'll make a black one.

4th mold: I made a black purple and cream colored 14 inch before I decided that the mold was indeed too wide.  Going back to the drawing board, I shrunk the size of the mold, but it came with a slightly smaller size in the end and the mold was about 11 inches.  O well, the size seemed fine still.  Having done multiple colors seemed to help me determine if I liked the mold or not, so I decided to just go make 5 or 6 shades of this one.  

5th mold:  I don't know why, but I google searched dildo lengths while I was waiting for the molds to set.  Turns out, most people prefer dildos in the 6-9 inch range?  So, maybe I just... you know...make a mold for each of those?  6,7,8,9?  Do a few color for each?

10th mold: Okay, so I did those 4 molds and I made a few colors for each, but then I was like ""if feet are good enough for half inches, so are dicks.""  

15th mold: I just did a 6.9 inch mold for..reasons.  I'll be back after I maybe take the dog for a walk.  Oh shit, I need to get my hot pocket don't I."
479,You mean like most subs?
480,YTA.
481,Yeah baby keep going
482,"The kids will have so much fun laughing when retelling this story to eachother in 10 years time. The parents will eventually join in on the laughter.

Funniest story I've read in a long time. I honestly think that in the long run you've enriched their lives, and they will never forget your name."
483,"Not facetious, I‚Äôm being 100% serious with you. Why should I make you feel bad? I‚Äôm having a good time here with all these comments, so you should deserve some nice words too :)"
484,"So I don‚Äôt mean to be that jackass because I feel for you, (and hope you make a swift recovery) but  peanut butter is basically oil. Well, a large percentage of it is oil. Imagine if you microwaved regular butter or vegetable oil for 1:30 and then drank that. I‚Äôm not surprised it lead to severe burns. 

Still sucks though. And I have definitely had my moments of stupidity too so I shouldn‚Äôt be one to judge. I hope that you have decent insurance or that your friend is helping out with the ER bill."
485,"He fit it in the empty whole where the lock mechanism would have been.  And he got stuck, no need to rub salt in the wound."
486,And my penis I was jerking.
487,"""And why are all so tanned?"""
488,The archives are incomplete
489,She'll never eat dick or onion rings again. I don't think many of us will.
490,"On a scale of one to dead, he's at least an eight."
491,Sometimes you gotta work the boba up and down the straw
492,"It was also the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen

I‚Äôm so fucked"
493,It's tonsils all the way down.
494,"It'd be weird if you flushed the toiled and stayed there ten more minutes, in perfect silence."
495,Sounds like the start of a romantic comedy
496,"Hahaha, I‚Äôll try to tell her that."
497,Well the app works
498,A helicopter? They gotta be bored as hell over there.
499,TIFU because I kiss and tell.
500,we tried
501,"‚òû ‚òû‚ï≠( Õ°¬∞ Õ°¬∞ ‚àÄ Õ°¬∞ Õ°¬∞)‚ïÆ‚òû ‚òû -- *Haha, so tiny!*"
502,I'd actually cry for a good mixer as a gift... Fuck em
503,"Yeah! She was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad, after a few minutes I could move my arm enough to reach my phone so I just watched Netflix til I could move my legs a few hours later‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúthat still sounds awful!!‚Äù"
504,"I briefed the paragraph, and read it as 13 *year* old, instead of *month*. Guess my surprise when he bit your dick and I had to reconfirm."
505,"Dominance: Asserted

Police: Called

Hotel: Trivago"
506,Dude why didn't you just press Ctrl + Z
507,"As a mom, I guarantee you that talk with her daughter was on the topic of raising her standards."
508,I was gonna say I was expecting a story of him discovering it's filled with years old mouldy cum
509,"Had I written your TLDR, I would have said ‚Äútook a poo on the loo of a  Choo Choo as I flew past a queue‚Äù"
510,High Milage username you got there...
511,"We still have it In the closet somewhere, no idea why but it feels strange to throw my own dick away. Also strange looking at it so we just threw it in the back of a box to be forgotten. I can only hope I hide it well enough to scar my grand children when I die and they're going through an estate sale. Hahahhaa"
512,It means I disappoint a few people instead of one.
513,"1,600 crayons? 

Holy _fuck_. 

Hahahahaha, oh my god. 

What's crazy is if my partner did this I'd be mad he wasted crowns like that but this would be so hilarious to me after I got passed that."
514,It was brave and the right thing to confess.
515,Here‚Äôs the real story
516,"Dad is still here, in some way, in all of us."
517,"Meh, off and on relationship AND she cheated, dude deserves to be skeptical.  That shit happens and can seriously fuck the rest of you life. If the dude was the cheater in this story and her girlfriend's response was along the lines of ""are you sure you want to be having a baby with this guy?"" would you be telling the lady to go buy him flowers? gtfo

The only FU here is you knew you were on speakerphone... that conversation definitely needed to happen."
518,"Haha haha perfect. 

Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. 
[Black screen. White text. ‚Äú3 weeks earlier‚Äù]"
519,Isn't that what the poop knife is for?
520,"""What's a potato?""

""Oh dear! I must've done too much damage."""
521,There are too scenarios. Either this girl has balls of steel and played it off as nothing happened OR you are the luckiest motherfucker alive...
522,"""So I was going to shit and jerk one out but I was like oh shit some one is already in here."""
523,"&gt;One of the newer cops says his cousin has one of these and it did this at the bar one time.

It's like the fence guys in King of the Hill.

""Them dang ol' insulin pumps!""

""Yep.""   ""Yep""   ""uh-huh""

You get the feeling if it had been a bomb, they woulda poked it with a stick."
524,"Hobby shop, dude. Say hobby shop."
525,"I mean if no one else is gonna eat it, I will"
526,"U need to clean it every time you take a shower I know it might be painful, but u have too. Didn't they teach you this in sex ed?"
527,"Ya for real, could've drowned"
528,Literally just tell her exactly what you said here. Text and say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm feeling really uneasy and upset at how I acted and I wanted to talk face to face. Could we maybe grab coffee so I can apologize correctly?‚Äù
529,So was he the father?
530,I‚Äôm just hoping the mouthwash is gonna work because I don‚Äôt know what else can get rid of that smell and taste
531,He didn't wanna lose the load
532,"Ok now. Because he sent me the post i have to interject on some mistakes here! First I LOVED that vacuum because I put the order in at Home Depot all he had to do was pick it up. Second my other gifts was 10 pack of make up wipes, and the the dick mold! The dick mold was created on Christmas Day through laughing and confusion as to how this was a good Christmas present! He‚Äôs a fantastic husband but not a great gift giver. I also refuse to use the creation its just strange and not my thing"
533,SO THAT WAS YOUR CONDOM I FOUND ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY THE OTHER DAY!!!! Do you want it back?
534,Ask her if it hurt when she fell from the sky
535,Sounds more like a fucked windsock if it was already used.
536,"Yeah fuck her lol. Tells you to do something then does that. Insecure as hell, you're better off without that for sure."
537,The Craigslist ad said ‚Äúcozy‚Äù and ‚Äúunique‚Äù. That‚Äôs code for cramped and smells bad.
538,After many years you hand her the toaster while you have something she really wants behind your back ;)
539,Yep it's rude AF to put a call on speaker when the other party doesn't know.
540,"You are just all kinds of stupid. lol.

&amp;#x200B;

A) Telling your friends about it over a group chat was stupid, never write anything down that might get you in serious trouble.

B) Agreeing to take a picture was beyond stupid, it's none of their damn business.

C) Taking a picture, while right next to her, was, like, a level of stupid I have a hard time coping with. I mean, can you like tie your own shoes or do you have to wear the velcro kind?

D) The smartest thing you did was say ""I was taking a selfie!"", I'm honestly kid of stunned you came up with such a good excuse so quickly... but then you totally fucked it up by not following it up with ""but the camera was facing the wrong way when I did it on accident"".

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully you will have a serious workplace injury in the next few minutes before that woman calls HR so you have an excuse to leave the building. Losing a finger might be worth it."
541,"""and Chad, stop wearing that mask of my face."""
