1,Excellent Christmas drama. OP update us on who is your new dad.
2,"Love the mental image of all the kids in various states of inebriation sitting in a circle playing ""guess the bastard"". 

""Lookit this guy! Lookit that fuckin' nose! You see the rest of us with that nose?"""
3,Woah ok. I thought you fucked ur sister or something.
4,OP please let me know which one is my dad as well.
5,"I like to think that every throwaway in this sub is actually the same person, fucking up over and over again."
6,"I mean, it is OP‚Äôs mom so any of us could be the father."
7,"* Best case scenario: one of the kids has a different dad
* Worst case: all of the kids have a different dad
* Worster case: all the kids have a *different* different dad."
8,Could be the nose.....Could also be the fact that Jake is black.
9,"‚Äúand we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad‚Äù

I‚Äôm sorry but that made me giggle. "
10,"I agree paternity test plus an update is required
"
11,Not enough dna test kits in the world for that 
12,Sounds like ya gave them beat-off music instead of off-beat
13,"Don‚Äôt want to see your son‚Äôs hard cock?
That‚Äôs ok, just remember to knock!
"
14,"I had the opposite thing happen. I did 23 &amp; Me and found out that my first cousins, who I'm not close with (they were estranged for a long time from my dad's brother), also had done 23 &amp; Me because it matched us as first cousins.

I told my dad this and he was like wait, it said that Karen is your first cousin? And I was like yeah? And he asked to see it and then he said, I have to call my brother.

Turned out that my uncle has been convinced for decades that his ex-wife had an affair and his youngest daughter, Karen, wasn't really his.

Turns out she has been this whole time."
15,"Two weeks is pretty early to even suspect pregnancy.  Your bro should probably get a paternity test.

EDIT: JFC people, I said early, not impossible."
16,If this is a corporate store you might want to give HR a call about your bosses behavior and attitude when calling in sick. Probably still not have a job but a person should not be harassed when calling in.
17,"&gt;She told us how she didn‚Äôt want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals.

This adds so much to the authenticity of the story. This is exactly the kind of thing someone comes up with on the spot to try, and fail, to hide something."
18,Your mom is a DNA test kit
19,"Hahaha..  sorry, not funny, but a similar thing happened with me.  My mom bought both of my sisters DNA kits and when I inquired as to why I was left out she told me my results would be the same as theirs, so I asked why she bothered getting them both the kits and she got dead serious and told me I needed to stop."
20,People who were just banging away in the 80s and 90s didn‚Äôt see this one coming. Damn. 
21,Probably not his. 
22,With ancestry you inject unlabeled chemicals via syringe and then mail your feces a day later
23,"Everyone hears about this kind of shit but you never expect it to happen to you. 

A guy found me on 23andme and it turned out we had 12.5% dna in common making us close cousins. But then I found out he was born in the fifties which makes cousinship impossible. 

It turns out he‚Äôs my half uncle. And in the process of figuring out how the hell he eluded the family, it turned out that the guy we thought was my great uncle was actually my uncle - my grandma hid the fact that her very younger brother was actually her kid. And he was this guy‚Äôs brother. 

Those kinds of bombshells can completely rewrite your family tree. It‚Äôs wild. 

Edit: this blew up overnight, I just want to add that there was no fault involved - my grandmother had an extremely rough early life in WW2 and into postwar Europe. There‚Äôs zero judgement for her choices (and it‚Äôs not clear how much was even her choice to begin with). She passed away several years ago so some of the reasoning and specifics will never be understood.

If your family has a strange adoption story or gave a child up along the way, remember that it was a vastly different time with a difficult social landscape. Be gentle and considerate of folks. "
24,"BF's mom was super cool.

You should thank her for being exceedingly kind and understanding"

Boy: mom, can I *please* get a new phone??

You:  *rolls out larger, shinier karaoke machine...*

29,"And here I am thinking it's silly how frequently my parents knock. 

This morning my  mum knocked and came in to talk to me, I was lying in bed on my phone. 1 minute after she leaves, she knocks again and waits for me to tell her to come in. It seemed ridiculous at the time, but I guess it's better than this üòÇ"
30,"When I was 3-4 months along with my second child, I was trying to clean out the closet in her room to be and threw my back out. I fell to the floor and couldn‚Äôt move!  My son was about 18 months old, so I thought I might get him to understand enough to bring me the cordless phone. 

Sure enough, he came when I called and seemed to understand ‚Äúphone‚Äù. He trotted off like a man on a mission - only to return with the microphone from his karaoke machine. He couldn‚Äôt see why I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with it, so he proceeded to bop me over the head with it!  I was torn between laughing and crying. 

I finally managed to creep with my knees and elbows enough to get to the phone and call for help. I never have let my son forget this story, though!"
31,He decided to write that in his journal?!?! That's udderly bizarre.
32,"True Story. Huge turtle lover here, was driving my car when I noticed a turtle crossing the road, and more or less hunkered down in the middle of the road. I pulled over in the nearest parking lot and started to make my way to the turtle to move him to the grassy shoulder where he would be safe. At this point he has moved towards the side of the road I am on, when I noticed a semi truck coming, wheels dead aligned with the little guy. I literally panicked because I knew he was going to get hit and I could do nothing. Sure enough turtle got hit, but only the backside of the shell. Turtle shot towards me, Mario cart style into the ditch. Thinking he's dead, I looked for him and to my amazement he was walking through the grass just fine. That's how strong turtle shells are. "
33,Best case scenario is no one is someone else's kid but the mom cheated and wasn't sure if one of them was
34,"Given your parents reaction, you weren't the one who fucked up here."
35,"Well one thing is for sure, mom won‚Äôt come in without knocking ever again!  So in the morning let them say something about it as you did nothing wrong ! "
36,"&gt;So there we were, laying in bed naked... my finger in my wifes vagina and her hand wrapped around my dick, both of us covered in tiny speckles of cat shit.

That's a sentence right there.

37,"Makes me want to leave random fucked up journals places. Just make up some random stuff. Might even put a return address on the inside, with the name and addy of someone I find annoying. "
38,"2 weeks is too early to post positive on an at home pregnancy test.

43,"My father also used the AncestryDNA kit. He didn't find anything unusual in the results, exactly what he thought it would be. But something weird did happen after he checked the box to allow ""close matches"" to contact him.

Well, soon after he gets contacted by a woman he had never met who lives over a thousand miles away from him, saying that Ancestry told her that the two of them are cousins. Genealogical records show no relation, but she told my Dad that of her three siblings, only one of them had the ""expected"" ancestry report. Their parents were no longer living, so no one to ask.

Anyway, upon further conversation, my Dad finds out that when this woman was born, she lived in the same city as most of my Dad's family. So he asks her to send him a picture, and he swears, ""It's uncle Louie in a wig!"""

52,"This actually just happened to some non-direct relatives of mine, essentially my uncles in-laws. 

His brother in law and the wife have three kids who all did 23AndMe, and found out the oldest girl is not his daughter, but some other guy that his wife slept with early on in their marriage, got pregnant and thought she‚Äôd be able to hide it forever (the daughters like 32 now so they didn‚Äôt have at home DNA tests back then and she probably never foresaw that being a thing). Long story short we kind of always knew because she didn‚Äôt look like anyone else in that family but when they found out they all flipped on their mom about it and now the parents are getting divorced.

54,"Turtle shells are ridiculous‚Äî there was an alligator snapping turtle near my bus stop when I was a little kid, just sitting in the middle of the road. Nobody wanted to move that nasty sumbitch along, since an adult snapping turtle will take your hand off given half a chance.

55,"There is a chance that it was a joke or reference to a joke.

71,Yeah. I did the 23 and Me and all you do is spit in a tube. Not sure if Ancestry is any different. 
72,"2 weeks ago? It's *not impossible* that she knows she's pregnant already, but I highly doubt it unless she was already pregnant before the party.  I'd have her take a pregnancy test around him (could be lying about that) and then a paternity test (if positive).  All ASAP, because if he thinks she's already pregnant, what could raw dogging it again hurt? 

To convince him, just explain how wrong all the timing is.  It takes at least 9 days for HCG levels to be high enough to get a positive, and she'd have to have been ovulating just after the party, AND she'd have to have missed a period (unless she wanted this kid and planned the whole thing and was testing early).  Whichever way you look at it, she's probably insane. "

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, I have Parkinson's. I was one of the 23andme research studies. There are two main Genetic known carries, LKKR2 and GBA. I'm negative on both of those, but over 90% of those with Parkinson's are negative for those genetic markers. So they start looking at what is common among those with Parkinson's, when LKKR2 and GBA are not involved.

I'm what is known as Young Onset PD (over 21 under 50) when symptoms first were noted by a MD.  Most of those YOPD seem to have a much slower progression, but is there something hidden in our genetics that means some are have very slow progression and other have faster progression.

So to get a broader understanding, the more people who answer the more answers the better.  Irony is a lot of people with Parkinson's markers will never develop Parkinson's, so maybe there are eight different genetic items PLUS an environmental factor that causes Parkinson's.

Oh, of my sibling. Three of us can detect the scent of asparagus in urine, the other three think that is just weird!"

159,"IIRC- ovulation happens about the middle of the period, so 2 weeks before the next one is due, based on 28-day cycle. If she knows and took a test when she wasn't even seriously overdue, then what is going on?  Or was she so nervous about the risk (after asking for it) that she started testing early? (Some tests are good after 10 days). 

Anyway, any girl eager for a bareback ride at just the right/wrong time rings some alarm bells. Especially, if she latched onto some nerdy stay-in-the-room kid who was likely to go at it no questions asked. (How did they meet? How long together? etc.)  Just be sure it's not a set-up.  ...paternity test.  "

236,"I have no problem giving away all of my genetic and trait information for the sake of scientific progress and betterment of humanity.  What I have a problem with is if the companies want to use that for monetary gain - which they most certainly are.

This sort of project needs to happen in the public domain.  In some ways, it already has.  Look up [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org).  What started out with 1000 genomes from around the world has now completed 10,000 genomes from 26 (iirc) human populations.  If we could each contribute not just our DNA but also pay a small fee for sequencing, this information could become huge.  Companies like 23 and me are trying to do just that - but for profit and gain.  

When the human genome project was initially started, it was hoped that it would unlock secrets to curing metabolic disease.  What we have learned instead is that sequence is only part of the game.  Mendelian traits are few and far between - traits where one or two major genes control the trait in question.  A large majority of traits are instead controlled by numerous genes (read: loci) each contributing ever so slightly to this so called ""complex trait"".  Only by doing large scale studies of association between traits (which is what 23&amp;me's survey is all about) and the sequence can we begin to entangle this very complex web of gene regulation and function.  We aren't quite there yet!

252,"Former HR manager checking in.

One thing I absolutely hated were employees coming up to me upset that they were accused of faking illnesses or being given a hard time for calling out. I've had many talks with the sales management about it to the point where corporate HR got involved and stood behind me. It is wildly inappropriate for management to make accusations and berate their employees, especially when calling out ill. Even with problematic employees who would be late to their own funeral or call out of work more often than changing their underwear. Mark the absence, follow the attendance policies, and move on. Good management will plan for call-outs and absences during peaks and have a contingency plan in place, for the sake of being proactive.

As someone who's also been accused of faking an illness while calling out of work (while having a track record of near-perfect attendance) it strikes a cord. Do not accuse your employees of faking an illness. They're not coming in. Accept the call out and move on with your day. Insulting and berating the employee certainly isn't going to inspire them to come in, especially when they're well ill.

It sounds to me like you're much better off. I'm sorry you lost your job around this time of year, but I wish you the best of luck on your search for a new one. Hopefully with a more pleasant boss."

Reality is that you're consenting adults (I assume), and they should really knock before entering a room.

While it‚Äôs not guaranteed that ovulation happens at 2 weeks prior to menstruation, it‚Äôs generally the rule (YMMV). Women may have late cycle or irregular ovulation (post-21 days from prior cycle) which is one of the factors in struggling to get pregnant(*note - it can be corrected once identified*). Also other factors such as stress, hormone levels, etc can affect ovulation and cause an early or late egg release. But, if the egg isn‚Äôt fertilized within 24ish hours and have a successful implantation, you won‚Äôt get pregnant. 

Source: mucho collegio, plus my wife and I struggled with fertility for years before finally getting pregnant.

380,"&gt; Now consider the tortoise and the eagle.

&gt; The tortoise is a ground-living creature. It is impossible to live nearer the ground without being under it. Its horizons are a few inches away. It has about as good a turn of speed as you need to hunt down a lettuce. It has survived while the rest of evolution flowed past it by being, on the whole, no threat to anyone and too much trouble to eat.

&gt; And then there is the eagle. A creature of the air and high places, whose horizons go all the way to the edge of the world. Eyesight keen enough to spot the rustle of some small and squeaky creature half a mile away. All power, all control. Lightning death on wings. Talons and claws enough to make a meal of anything smaller than it is and at least take a hurried snack out of anything bigger.

&gt; And yet the eagle will sit for hours on the crag and survey the kingdoms of the world until it spots a distant movement and then it will focus, focus, focus on the small shell wobbling among the bushes down there on the desert. And it will leap‚Ä¶

&gt; And a minute later the tortoise finds the world dropping away from it. And it sees the world for the first time, no longer one inch from the ground but five hundred feet above it, and it thinks: what a great friend I have in the eagle.

&gt; And then the eagle lets go.

&gt; And almost always the tortoise plunges to its death. Everyone knows why the tortoise does this. Gravity is a habit that is hard to shake off. No one knows why the eagle does this. There‚Äôs good eating on a tortoise but, considering the effort involved, there‚Äôs much better eating on practically anything else. It‚Äôs simply the delight of eagles to torment tortoises.

&gt; But of course, what the eagle does not realize is that it is participating in a very crude form of natural selection.

&gt; One day a tortoise will learn how to fly.

408,"As someone who works HR for a large company and has a wife who went through something like this, I feel the need to chime in. 

My wife works in retail and called in sick twice during the month leading to Christmas (she has a terrible immune system). One of her managers at the store told her she had to come in anyway and if she did not, she would get written up. After a few minutes of trying to explain her situation to the manager, I had enough and had my wife give me the phone. I told the manager on the phone that I am very familiar with HR in corporations and that I knew their specific company policy well, and no where did it state calling in sick wasn't allowed or would result in a write up. I informed her that if she did not reverse her decision, that we would be reaching out to the corporate HR team. I also gave her a friendly reminder of how companies view retaliation. Needless to say, her last words to me were ""you don't have a right to talk to me you aren't the employee"". 

So, we made the call, making sure I informed them of my profession, and it gets pushed to the regional HR manager, who reaches the district manager, who then calls the store manager etc. My wife was treated better than ever, with a personal apology from the district manager, an email from the HR regional manager, and the store had to undergo management training regarding people calling in sick."

The confessions have only happened in the last 5ish years.
