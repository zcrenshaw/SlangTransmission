0,"That kid is a freaking rockstar. We’ve had years of talks about doing this and he loves kids of siblings and friends. I read up and studied this a lot. Making sure to double the time and love, not cut it in half. He admitted to me the other day he’s always wanted a brother. He said it’s his mommy’s gift to him to have a full family. I broke down as soon as he was out of sight on that one."
1,Title checks out
2,"You've been dealt a tough hand.... could be a recurrence, could be a different cancer, or could be totally something else.  Please go to a doctor and find out.  If it's not cancer, then you can do something and move past this worry.  If it is cancer. there are so many new treatment options that may be available to you that weren't 20 years ago when you were a teen.    Don't let fear remove your volition."
3,Lol no she’s about 15 years younger and has become like a baby sister or step daughter to me. She’s a beautiful person inside and out with a great head  on her shoulder. About to graduate with almost perfect grades in microbiology and going to need school. She made a mistake with birth control like any of us could have done and made the best of the situation by far. She is awesome b
4,"It’s not common but absolutely do. The whole adoption process sucks and is on punch in the gut after another. Started 2 years ago. With a private adoption agency. This was the 3rd birthmother that chose me. One went with a couple instead, one kept the baby and then this amazing woman gave me a gift I could never say thank you enough."
5,"I got nothing to ask, I just want to thank you for not being a fucking idiot.

Thank you, stranger."
6,"You're not a victim. You're a warrior. You're braver than a lot of us. But, consider this: if it really is cancer and you choose not to undergo treatment, you _will_ die. If you go to a doctor and undergo treatment, you may deal with some, or maybe many, negative feelings and thoughts, but if you stay strong, you'll survive and you'll rise higher than ever. I'm sure all of Reddit will support you if you undergo treatment. I know I will."
7,"You are not happy. You are experiencing a honeymoon phase. When the new wares off the carrier and relationship, more shit will arise. Happiness is not truly attainable. It is not biologically efficient. Constantly happy humans don’t work to improve anything, which would lead to extinction. The only reason you are where you are, and the only reason we have what we have as a species is because we werent satisfied. It’s natural to be unsatisfied, and you will get back to it soon."
8,"I normally charge $15/hr for 1 kid. Then +$5 per additional kid. Whenever someone asks me my rate, this is what I give and families I work for that are not part of the 1% are fine with it. 

However, most families that are part of the 1% normally set the rate for me. For example, one family I babysat for pays me $50/hr for 3 kids. But normally, they'll ask my rate and pay that + generous tips. I get the most tips when the parents come home drunk from a night out. One time a dad pulled out a couple hundreds out of his pocket and ended up giving me $300 as a tip because I did such a good job sitting for their precious angel. They were absolutely plastered, but no complaints."
9,"I don't even know where to start!

One winter break I spent back home in LA, I babysat for this family who were big time lawyers. During this time, I had to borrow my dad's car which is a Lexus since my car was back at college. The kid commented that it was a cheap car and that I should bring a better car tomorrow. Imagine if I showed up with my Jeep!"
10,"To restore balance. Let’s break down the two words so we only look at the phonetic part being discussed. This is the ‘g’ in refrigerator and the ‘dg’ in fridge. According to a study done by Samuel Morse, the inventor of Morse Code, the most used letter in the alphabet is E. 

So, for every 1200 ‘E’s used, there are only 4,400 D’s used and only 1700 G’s. Given this, the lack of the letter D in refrigerator allows the balance between the usage of the letters D and G to grow closer together until they are perfectly balanced, like all things should be."
11,"We had a cat who went missing for a month.  She randomly showed up when we opened our garage door one day.  She was skin and bones,  and we thought she got trapped under a house or something.  We immediately took her to the vet and they said she had problems with her kidneys and she would probably go soon. We had to feed her special milk and water but now she is fat and happy.  

Pets are more resilient than we think. 

Good vibes or prayers coming your way,  I hope all works out."
12,I didn't know they let single dads adopt. Was it difficult?
13,"Oh hell yeah.

I grew up in LA, so I was surrounded by materialism and know my designers. I stumbled across this Goyard card holder that had been laying around for months in the exact same place, but I could not get myself to even touch it because my conscience would kill me."
14,You are the most disagreeable person.
15,"My father was a communist. My mother and I we're glad that my father passed away when I was 10. I was glad he passed away when he did because Hitler would have killed him for not shutting his mouth. My father was open minded. I divorced my first husband in 1959 because he was having an affair. I did not support Hitler, but I did not speak out about it. I had to keep my mouth shut because if you spoke out you could be shot. If you spoke out to the wrong person they would say ""she loves the Jews"" and then you'd get shot with a revolver"
16,"I am a stack of atoms. The atoms that from me existed 1000 years ago, therefore I did."
17,"Just saying, I would totally donate via GoFundMe, DonateKindly, Fundly or whatever."
18,How is your 8 year old adjusting to bring a big brother/sister?
19,"There is a lot of child abuse being swept under the rug. 

When I was a young girl, a known child predator joined our congregation. The Elders knew about it but didn't inform the others. 

Fortunately for me, my father was an Elder so I was safe... ish.

JW's are very friendly to other witnessess so families with children likely invited him over to dinner, chatted to him, went on the ministry with him.

It would have been very easy for him to get close to a child and gain there trust.

I don't believe he ever actually abused one of the children in my congregation. To my knowledge he was charged with child porn and sentenced to prison a few years ago.

The fact that the Elders knew about him and did nothing makes me sick."
20,"Incorrect. Sexism is good. You say sexism is bad until your house catches on fire, a 200ln wooden beam collapses and lands on you, then the local fire department’s diversity hire 110lb female who happened to be close by comes to rescue you. You then helplessly lay there as her only option is to drag the beam off of you slowly as she can’t lift it, giving you both 3rd degree burns as it peaks your skin off."
21,No I’m not.
22,"(She chuckled when I asked her this question. I'm guessing because it was all terrifying) 

When the bombs started falling. We didn't have bunkers in the Jewish ghettos, only basements under very tall building quarters. You could here the sizzle from the bombs falling and you wouldn't know if you would come out of that basement or not."
23,"LOL.

All of the ones part of the 1% are insanely spoiled. Most of them aren't used to getting the word no."
24,"I would say so. I'm in IT now but the love for IT came from Jungle Land, from being fascinated with how a huge wooden box with electronics worked itself, so I started taking them and computers apart and a super young age. I also learned another important lesson. Back in 98', I remember they had a NINTENDO 64 in the prize booth for like 15000 tickets. I was destined and since my parents couldnt afford it I knew I would win one by getting enough tickets for it. Every time my mom would offer me tip money for the ticket-related machines, the slot machines, waiting by the entrance to see if some kids parents would give me their tickets as some people do in arcades when they have some left over. I saved and saved, for months. I was at about 13k tickets, stashed away upstairs in one of the admin offices, when I walk to the prize booth for my daily gaze at it only to see that it's gone and I turn around seeing a well off looking kid taking it away. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Taking apart arcade machines and PC's started the love at a young age for the IT"
25,"I honestly have never had a hard hiring process. I provide all families my background checks and references. I am also CPR/AED/First Aid certified and a pre-med student who does a lot of work in the hospital , so that helps a lot. I honestly just get lucky with the 1% hiring me.

Best - The oldest sibling helping me out because they know how crazy their younger siblings are. Literally older siblings who help out are angels.

Worst - Getting food thrown at me because they miss mommy."
26,How many doors did you knock on
27,"When it's a date night, it's a pretty chill night of eating dinner and watching TV. Then getting paid sitting on their couch doing homework while the kids are asleep until the parents get home. One time a parent gave me $500 for dinner for his 3 kids and said ""go wherever the kids want to go!"" We ended up at some fancy restuarant in Beverly Hills, and the bill reached $300+

However, when I'm babysitting the whole day, that's a whole another story. Most rich kids will have several extra curricular activities in a day, so as their sitter, I am also their driver. One family I babysat for literally put their kids in everything (piano, swim, tennis, golf, ballet, singing, etc.). Their schedules are pretty insane."
28,Too many to count.
29,"This one is actually sad, but one dad came home with McDonald's and told me not to tell anyone because his wife would be so mad that he's not being a role model eating healthy in front of the kids."
30,Have you ever came across something that was really tempting to steal?
31,"It was hard. You had to build up your broken homes. There was no one there to help, you had to do it on your own. Nurnburg-fürth was burned to the ground. There wasn't a stone left. It took a while. We were really saddened and ashamed about the camps. There were nights when young people would come out and houses would be empty. We didn't know that Jews were getting picked up through the night. I never heard the word Auschwitz in Poland during my time. One thing you had to do is give the Nazi salute and say ""Hail Hitler"" because if you didn't they would assume you were against Hitler and supported the Jews. (My Omi doesn't really understand the last part of your question about large proportion)"
32,I never did. I’m certainly open to the idea but it hasn’t been a priority. Had a couple relationships since that didn’t pan out. It would take a special woman and they are many out there.
33,stupid onions....
34,"Yes vehicular homicide and DUI. Was sentenced to 10 years and got out a couple years ago. Moved away I heard. I swore when I was done with the court system I would never let that person suck one more ounce of life out of me. 

No one else hurt thankfully. He t-boned at a high speed. He broke a few bones and some cuts but was out of the hospital in a couple days."
35,"I wouldn't say horror story caused by a kid, but I accidentally texted a kid's mom calling her daughter a ""spoiled little brat"" when it was supposed to go to my boyfriend. Mom came home and she was nice and understanding about it, but didn't hire me ever again which was expected. I felt SO bad but her daughter was literally INSANE throwing everything in plain sight at me."
36,"It's difficult.
Having been raised to believe in a God all of my life it's tough to change.
Sometimes I think I'm getting punished by God for leaving and I worry that I'll die at Armageddon.

All I know is that if there is a God, he is a loving God.
If there isn't a God then I can take care of myself."
37,"Once when I was 13 I had a very realistic dream where I was going to the bathroom, it made me wet the bed in real life. Is that the kind of thing that happens to you? Or it just happens without you knowing?

Ever since then I pinch myself before I pee when I wake up in the middle of the night to make sure. Hasn’t happened since. 

Glad you are open about it! I’m sure it can make your life difficult, but it’s nothing to be ashamed about."
38,"No you don’t, obviously"
39,Yes you were. You’ve always been ready but simple refused to acknowledge that you were.
40,No
41,Lol sorry I have those spread around the house I think too. Weird how that is.
42,Gonna break character here lol. I think arguing is a skill. People get too concerned with them being right versus knowing how to argue their point regardless of if it’s true.
43,"What was it like after the war? How did people in Germany feel about the camps, when they found out, and the way a large proportion of the western world viewed them?
Thank you for taking the time to do this."
44,"Ha I never was a big sleeper so this is more of the same. I honestly enjoyed  those long nights the first time around. And now even more. Sick I know it seems right? But me and the baby quiet rocking and feeding overnight, just the light from the mobile and nursery rhymes playing? That’s so special a little sleep is nothing compared to that."
45,"Child: Mommy can I buy *insert designer brand that cost $1000+*?
Mom: Just charge it on the card.

Legit would happen all the time."
46,"Even though it does hurt your pride enough ... to be perfectly honest, wearing the diapers to bed is a lot *less* embarrassing than waking up wet and having to tell my wife.  I put them on in the bathroom, by my self, slip on shirts or PK pants over them, and discard them in the morning without anyone seeing or knowing if they were wet; and no laundry to do.  It's less work, and way more discrete.

It's actually easier on my pride overall."
47,Good question. It’s hard to explain. People thought I had something missing since the wife has gone. Some people thought I was losing it and this was some odd thing trying to grasp something. All fair but all not true. The basic thing is that I felt I had something to give and could maybe help out a little one that needed it. I had the ability to give to a child. By giving I received thousands of times over so it’s actually selfish but wasn’t meant to be.
48,Yes. They deny it but it's true.
49,"Thank you so much, this was exactly when I needed to hear at the moment. I need to wake up every hour and give him electrolytes and give him a small portion of food every 2 hours. He is in a pretty bad way, he can't walk and is swollen and bruised in a lot of places. Hopefully we will start seeing a difference tomorrow."
50,"I am not Jewish. I was a poor Catholic, but I couldn't marry my first husband until I provided documentation that I wasn't Jewish. And he had to have documents saying he wouldn't marry a Jew and would not bare Jewish children. I do not think about the war on a regular basis, but it does come to me when I see something on TV or an old movie."
51,"Hahahaha no– but I have babysat during a ""let me throw a big party for no reason because I have $$$ to blow"" party and it was freaking insane. The family told me not to worry about parking that day because they had valet  at their own house for the party. On top of that, their house was big enough to lose the kids if they ended up running around so there was one point during the party I had to run around the whole house looking for these kids while everyone was dressed in nice suits and gowns while I was wearing leggings and a basic tee."
52,No I’m not.
53,"Most are rich from good jobs, and some are actually famous in the field they work in (art, biotech, etc.)"
54,"""I be 98 years old and feel very okay and still my brain is working and I'm a proud American now and happy to be in America""
(English is her second language, don't mind the grammar)"
55,I just ate cake for dinner. No I do not.
56,Did growing up in a theme park have an impact on the job you have as an adult?
57,"I've had kids throw food at me, hide in their big homes, and just plain out push out me. 

Most of the time if it's a materialistic want while we're out that I say no to because I can't afford it, I normally say ""Maybe when mommy/daddy comes home, you can ask them?"". They'll have a tantrum, but every kid has tantrum wether rich or not. You just have to have patience and calm them down with distractions."
58,(-1)^(1/2)
59,"My brother is a single man who has adopted a young boy.

I empathise with you how hard, long, emotionally draining and lonely this must have been for you (even with the strongest support system)

All the respect to you!"
60,It’s fucking trash
61,"I really want to make a joke about my inability to keep my mouth shut but that may be in poor taste 😂 

I found out after the fact that he had been having an affair and I guess removing someone from the picture is easier than just filing for a divorce. Makes sense to me."
62,I would say a golf simulator and bowling alley in their home.
63,We were very aware that everyone hated us. But it was actually easier to live there after the war. There were jobs and we were rebuilding fast. I have to give the Germans credit in that time after the war. They were fast workers and hard workers. They wanted a better life after Hitler. When I came to America people would call me a Nazi because it was so embedded into the hate.
64,"Birthdays are bad because one dude in the Bible got murdered at someone's party and ruined it for the rest of us.

Christmas is bad because Jesus never directly said ""Today is 25th December. It's my birthday. Please celebrate it. Please.""

Easter is bad because Jesus died on a stake and not a cross (very important, any JW will tell you.)

Halloween is bad because evil spirits or something.

We were outcast from the religion because my Mum separated from my abusive Dad, which is the worst sin you can commit. Worse than Christmas."
65,I am both
66,You are the most agreeable person.
67,Oh! I didn’t know that part! It’s like Hunger Games: Eternity Edition
68,"Nope. It was good. The scientists of the nazi era made more medical advancement during their rein than any other time period ever. Today we still use things they found out to treat and/or use hypothermia, sea water ingestion, high altitude exposure, kidney failure, sulfa drugs, gangrene, chemical burns, sterilization, mental trauma, surgical procedures, and so on.

Therefore the total lives taken compared to the total lives potentially saved since then and in the future leans towards positive."
69,How many of these kids you baby sit are spoiled brats?
70,"Hard to explain, because wherever you go you saw signs saying ""we won"" we won this city, we won this town. We did not have TV and we only heard the news twice a day. Hitler was very quiet when he lost an area. We only knew we were losing when the Americans came in."
71,"There's a whole team of animators and artists working at Bethel (JW HQ).

I'm pretty sure they don't get payed."
72,At least a dozen times since 1977. My daughter from my first marriage still lives in Regensburg. I haven't been back since 2007. The flight is just too long for me now.
73,You’re welcome random stranger
74,That N64 bit is devastating. I'm sorry for your loss.
75,He is in prison and will most likely be in prison for the rest of his life.
76,"Every food here is good, really, but I suggest you to chose not the biggest restaurants you can find but the small and traditional restaurant , maybe the ones without the translated menu', you'll enjoy the real Italian cousine"
77,"I use regular babysitting apps (UrbanSitter and Sittercity) and I get lucky. I live in LA and go to a college in a metropolitan city on the east coast. Most of my 1% families I babysit for are on the east coast. I also got really lucky because one family recommended me to all her 1% friends, and now I'm a babysitter for all of them."
78,No I won’t
79,Looks like you answered all of my questions
80,"This story is hitting me for some reason. Just a little kid spending tip money on games to get a Nintendo 64 and seeing it disappear. Im feeling all kinds of nostalgia, I loved theme parks so much, amusement parks, water parks, Im having flashbacks to amazing times as a kid reading your story. From one middle class kid to another whose dad never gave us enough quarters but we stretched it and made it fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Real talk, DM me and I will send you a mostly new Nintendo 64 in the mail. I want you to have one. And as my name should tell you, I love a good story and I like your story a lot!"
81,murica'
82,Are they rich from just good jobs or are some of them also rich and famous?
83,You will disagree with anything I say
84,Who exactly makes those shitty Youtube animations? I've been curious at why people would put their time into that
85,"I ate the concession stand food, or usually the admin office would usually have something catered upstairs so id munch on that (which it's usually healthy). 

&amp;#x200B;

If they were working late and I had school the next day I'd sleep in my aunts office on the couch or in my dad's office. If not just at my house.

&amp;#x200B;

Best experience: My mom entered me into a ""talent contest"" there where its like if youre 8 and under what's your talent? So I went up on the stage with a sweatshirt on, took one of my arms out of the sleeves and made it look like my heart was beating out of my chest but in fact it was my fist. I then took it off and flexed and I won (I was five, go easy on me)

&amp;#x200B;

Worst experience:

&amp;#x200B;

The N64 story below

&amp;#x200B;

Watching 9/11 happen with everyone watching it happen at the park. It was like the whole park stopped. I remember specifically watching men leave the park talking about how they are going to join the military ""they cant do this to us etc."" and remembering how bad I wanted to go with them. I was 7"
86,"I lost everything, (apartment, friends, family, self-respect, hope), and at my darkest moment I found some lovely people who know how to stay clean. I hung out with them to see what they do. I work a 12 step program and I am of service to addicts trying to learn about recovery. It helps me to help others.

I lost all connection with society. These recovering addicts loved me until I could love myself. I have found a life second to none."
87,Not really but I don’t even know what to look for. He’s arrogant and has an ability to compartmentalise that’s on a sociopathic level. I don’t think anyone saw anything coming at all.
88,How are you more correct than each person you are disagreeing with?
89,Rudest thing that's been said to you?
90,Do not doubt me
91,Since you where married to a Nazi soldier and I've personally heard most people in Germany actually stood behind Hitler. Did you support Hitler in the beginning and why? When did it become clear to you who he really was?
92,"When it was more sporadic I had those dreams occasionally.  I don't really have those anymore.

I also sometimes have dreams where i just wet my pants spontaneously, or feel my pants get warm suddenly.  I think that's me wrong the bed, and the dream just incorporating the sensation.

It can be inconvenient, especially when traveling, but at home it's not that big of a deal."
93,Hats off to you for surviving childhood! Do you ever give your parents grief for not vaccinating you? Are they vaccinated?
94,You are neither agreeable nor disagreeable
95,He have wrote a book though???
96,I have to be. I’m poor. I can’t afford to be an asshole.
97,"I still currently work for my favorite parents. The dad is a big time lawyer while the mom is a stay at home mom. Both are genuinely nice human beings and they always tell me ""whatever is mine is yours"". Whenever the mom would come home plastered from a night out, she just keeps telling me she loves me and asks me to never leave the city so she doesn't have to find a new babysitter. They're honestly the best and funniest, and I am so sad I have to leave them next year when I move back home."
98,"No, I don’t talk about it with my mom. She’s not some crazy lunatic like people might think, she just personally got a bad feeling about vaccines and chose not to give her kids any. She has however got us them when she felt we needed it, like I got a tetnis shot once because she was worried after I scraped my hand on a nail. I am pretty sure she is but I haven’t asked."
99,"Thanks, im still not over it lol"
100,Tell us some of the dirty secrets.
101,No you don’t.
102,Maybe you love him a little too much
103,You’re so fucking argumentative
104,No I won’t.
105,"One family brought me on an all expense paid weekend vacation + pay. Got my own room, was allowed to order anything I want from room service, and do whatever I want whenever I'm not with the kids. 

But the usual privileges I would recieve would be order whatever I want from fancy restuarants or paying for admissions to theme parks, movie theatres &amp; etc the kids want to go to .... driving the family range rovers or benz's to pick up their kids, and the list goes on.

Most gifts are just tips which I don't complain about."
106,A true sign of wealth: a stay-at-home parent who has a nanny/frequent babysitter.
107,"That's right. Only 144,000 go to heaven. Bit of an odd number but whatever."
108,I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Did you ever re-marry?
109,Did you have an okay relationship with your father
110,"Sorry about that, I changed my Instagram picture to my Omi playing with my cat.

I was born in it. My grandmother had a wood and coal store in the 1930s. We grew up very poor. Next to my building was a 3 story Jewish hospital and a nursing home. The bottom floor of the apartment was a small Jewish school I went out my house, across the street was synagogue. I lived there till I got married in 1945. During that time no one had heard of a concentration camp. It was such a ""hush hush"" affair. You didn't hear too much in that time. It was amazing how well everything was being kept from us. Since we didn't know what was going on at the time, it never really affected us."
111,"For the first time in a long time I am genuinely happy. My relationship with my family is better than ever, my career is taking off, and I recently began a relationship with a lifelong friend and its fucking incredible."
112,Using a knife from a kitchen set my mum bought me for Christmas lol.
113,"That makes complete sense. I’m going to give him that example and maybe he will see it from a different point of view. 

I never want him to be embarrassed around me because he wets the bed, I don’t think less of him or ANYONE who does. Things happen."
114,"""It is like a socialist to believe what they tell you is free. But it isn't so. It is impossible. They tried it in Europe and none can do it.""

""Take it easy. Be honest, I would like to have when I was a child, nice shoes, nice dress, but my mother couldn't give it to us. When I came to America I couldn't believe what I saw in stores. You cannot have it all at once, you have to work for it."""
115,"So, I'm a guy and delivered food to places when I was unemployed as a volunteer. I ended up helping some of these homes out by babysitting kids from about 8 to 12 years old.

They had literally NEVER heard no. Food stamps were spent on Hohos, and this morbidly obese kid just wouldn't stop about the fucking Hohos. The only reason I was allowed to do this is because I'm a very big guy. This isn't a ""spoiled white thing"".... It's a absentee parent thing."
116,"I visited Piza back in 2014 (I'm American), and we ate at this little hole in the wall restaurant that was authentic. No translated menu. We were the only ones in there and the owners and staff were so friendly and told us all about what to do while there. We laughed and joked and shared stories and questions, they loaded us up on probably the best food I've had in my life.

Highlight of the trip."
117,"After reading the rest of the thread, I can say with property it is too early to give up. Poetry is a hard sell. Any reputable publisher won't get a dime from you before publishing, they'll even pay you an advance in some cases. This is a vanity press that does nothing for the author but taking their money.

Keep on writing and building your social media. Dream big. You're just at the beginning, far away from the end."
118,I appreciate it. Much love to your brother and you for being there with him.
119,"That they don't like to work as we do and so they leave all the work to the north. I'm from Bergamo, the city of bricklayers that built half Italy, it's really rooted in us"
120,Very sad that some gets sick and cannot afford to get well again.  What kind of a sick cultural mindset is it where the vulnerable are left to die because they are not wealthy enough to live.
121,"Just to clarify: Are you Jewish? If so, did your first husband (Nazi soldier) know that about you and what was that like? 

I would also like to know whether 70 years later you still think about the war on a regular basis?"
122,So you’re both?
123,"How likely is it that the citizens will actually be able to rebuild their government on their terms with minimal involvement and influence from the military?
I'm sorry for what you all have been going through and I'm sorry if that was a harsh question or an unfair one.
Also, many people shared information about Sudan on Instagram and turned their profile pictures blue, did that help any bit?
Thank you."
124,No
125,"My s.o is 29 and wets the bed... I think it’s related to stress/old trauma that is still being dealt with. 
Do you wet the bed regularly?"
126,I wasn’t ready
127,How much do you miss sleep? Do you know how freaking amazing you are?
128,I work for a small company that years ago made me a consultant basically and has been family to me. The financial and emotional support is amazing. They are friends and family to me not just coworkers. They are heroes.
129,"To me at that age it was the sheer aspect of being alone, but learning how to talk to people and make friends and being that guy that can get you more plays on Tekken 2 or metal slug. Even though the park is in a warmer climate, my favorite times were in the arcade. Just endless rounds of the Jurassic park game, or Cruisin USA."
130,"Because the more people they convert, the higher score they get on their report card."
131,"Serious question, why do the witnesses that are doing street recruiting always look stupidly candid ? Like they all have this weird ""conservative high"" on their faces when they try to talk you into worshipping some kind of higher truth that doesn't reveal itself."
132,What's the most extra thing someone has in their house?
133,What was your most terrifying moment.
134,"In theory you can date a non JW but your parents and friends and will disapprove and you won't be allowed to get married in the Kingdom Hall. You'll probably get shunned.

Dating another Jehovah's Witnesses is very difficult. 

Firstly, you can only date with intent to marry. If you've been together a few years and haven't put a ring on it, people will ask why. Many of my friends have got married as young as 18 for this reason.

Secondly, you need a chaperone. Going to a movie? Bring a friend. Having a romantic dinner? Bring a friend. Spend time alone? Bring a friend. This may sound ridiculous but it's very important. Being alone with your partner may cause you to give into your throbbing biological urges.

Thirdly, your partner needs to be baptized. So, you, a happy baptized JW have found the perfect lover. They're kind, funny and very religious. There's only one problem. They've not gotten baptized yet. ""That's ok"", you tell yourself. ""This isn't something you can rush. I'm sure they will get baptized in their own time."" But your parents disagree. ""They're not serious about the religion."" They say at the dinner table ,""If they truly loved you they'd get baptized."" You plead and cry but they refuse to support your relationship. So, with a heavy heart you break up with them. They plead and cry and beg you to give them time but you refuse. Broken hearted, they leave. However, they come across your best friend by chance, your best friend doesn't care they're not baptized. You watch as your ex and bff fall in love, get married and have a baby. Your ex becomes the owner of a fancy restaurant while you work at a coffee shop. You eventually marry some nerdy photographer and your dad takes the ceremony. You made the right choice. Right?

And those are the all the steps you need to follow to start a happy relationship. The end!

❤️❤️❤️

The above story is actually the plot of a feature length JW movie released a few years ago. I got a bit carried away. Sorry."
135,Nope I’m pretty curvy.
136,What's the trashiest food they like to eat? Like does mom secretly dip pizza rolls in nacho cheese sauce while watching 80s porn?
137,"I try to break down only on regularly scheduled intervals. I say that as a joke but it’s kinda true. It comes in waves. This little guy brought on a whole new wave of emotions. Just have to suppress it in front of the older son, letting him see me emotional but not a basket case in order for him to have his emotions and other times the baby needs me so no time to deal with my emotions. Then later lose it."
138,"I read something a short story once (doubt it was real, but still funny) about how this pediatrician was talking to an anti vaxx mom and the mom was spewing out all of these conspiracy theories for why she wasn’t vaccinating. So the doc says, “what would you say if I told you that all of the anti vaxx propaganda that you see is actually foreign countries trying to weaken the US so that they can perform a bio nuclear attack” and she ended up vaccinating. I thought that was pretty great 🤣"
139,No she doesn’t. She attempted suicide without ever telling me goodbye even though she saw me on the same day as the attempt. She looked in my room and asked if I had seen her car keys. That was it.
140,Do you believe it resembles a cult?
141,"From the beginning I was told, be myself. Say what I wanna say. If I don’t feel comfortable answering anything then that’s fine. But to keep my cursing to a minimum. No script, nothing like that. Totally legitimate. And staff was kind."
142,"It seems like the drunk always survives unscathed... totally unfair.

You have my condolences."
143,I will stomp him with my boot. This is how I plan to kill the president of this ant hill in my front yard.
144,What on earth. How unexpected
145,Did you see it coming?
146,I did not get away really because I was found by the police. They had arrested him later that day as this happened around 4 in the morning. I was hurt quite a bit yeah.
147,"Have you done this job for anyone not in the 1%? If yes, how did the pay differ?"
148,"If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated."
149,"Keep us updated please!! Dogs are so strong, I'm praying so hard for yours."
150,Thanks but just a dad. Good or not will be determined over the next 30 or so years. A friend encouraged me to do this AMA that maybe could help a single parent or anyone adopting or for someone that lost a spouse.
151,"I wouldn't say strangest, but one kid asked if I can take her to the spa. The bill ended up being $500+ which is ridiculous for a 13 year old."
152,You will disagree with this but only if you are wrong about it.
153,No he's not
154,There are plus he’s not my age and has a bad heart. I can be hopeful right? Lol
155,"Sometimes I'll do that, but most of the time they want to go out and have fun. I've been fortunate enough to go to Disneyland, Universal Studios, and etc. for free because the kids wanted to go. 

Doritos? Oh hell no. Most of these rich people want their kids eating healthy af. It's absolutely ridiculious! Most of their snacks consist of fresh fruits cut by yours truly or a No BS bar."
156,Was the hiring process hard? Or more rigorous than for normal families? What’s the best and worst thing you’ve ever seen while babysitting for one of these families?
157,"I think I’ve done pretty good. Not as good as I say to others though. 
It bugs me to think he can go with life when she can’t. This person I never met before changed my life and generations after me. Who should have that type of power over someone else? He’s a felon and I have no doubt prison was hard so I think justice was served so that makes me come down to earth again."
158,What kind of food that is considered Italian is really just for tourists.
159,"I am an 18 year survivor myself. You have my full support. Please, please, get checked out and don’t kill yourself. You are not alone, you are worthy, and you got this! Feel free to message me for support ❤️"
160,Fuck that's depressing
161,"There wasn’t a huge amount of time between him leaving and the police arriving as my neighbours had already phoned them. 
Thank you 😊"
162,Have you thought of dating the birthmother?
163,"Haha, she probably knew her child was a spoiled little brat."
164,"Nope. According to Moore’s law, the advancement of technology is growing exponentially. Given this fact, it is inevitable we will reach a point of a singularity in which we will creative a virtual world that is indistinguishable from our own. In the virtual world, we could eventually create another that is the same as that one, which is the same as ours. We will be able to follow this pattern indefinitely creating an infinite amount of simulations inside one another.

Since this will happen, what is the probability we were the first ones to do so, and are not just one of the infinite in between. Therefore, it’s most likely the earth does not have a shape, and is simply code."
165,It might take a few days or a couple weeks.  Lots of love and patience. I believe in him and I'm sure you do too!
166,"What do you usually do with them? Do they just sit around and watch TV, or do you usually do activities that scream ""my parents are rich"""
167,What are the steriotypes that North Italians have for the south?
168,The world would be very strict and military. A dictatorship.
169,Thank you. And you’re correct. The statistics are shocking how better off the drunk is compared to the one hit
170,Was the drunk driver charged?
171,So in response after you say no what would they do and how would you resolve it?
172,"I remember it well. I was very young and don’t really have a healthy relationship to compare it to though. I believed things were okay and then I find out in the course of one night that everything I thought I knew about my husband was completely wrong. Now I’m rambling. 

I feel okay. I have a macabre sense of humour that I use to mask my ptsd bullshit lol."
173,"This. This is so pure and beautiful and I'm not crying, my eye is just leaking"
174,"This is a thread in which I will disagree with anything, obviously."
175,"It just blows me away that America doesn't have universal health care. People die because they can't afford to go to a doctor?

That's just ludicrous."
176,"I actually really want to.
My birthday was in March but my Mum's is in October.
Me and my sister are considering taking her out for a meal or something."
177,"So your insta is on private so I can't see your Omi...

Anyway, I feel like this might be a very insensitive question, but what was it like in the ghetto? How long were you there? And how long did it take to recover from your experiences, or is it something you still have to deal with on a daily basis?"
178,So you'll agree with whatever I say?
179,"I remember filling my card with excuses.

""Sorry I only did two hours I was sick.""

""I would have placed more magazines but my return visit was on holiday.""

""I was revising for my exams!""

Sucks."
180,Keep up the good work.
181,"You sound like an incredible dad. Your children are lucky to have you, and I’m glad they do. Thank you."
182,How do you feel about refrigerator not having the letter d like fridge does?
183,"Don’t they have some sort of doctrine about there only being 144,000 people going to heaven? If that’s true, wouldn’t it already be full? 

(Apologies if I’m mixing up JW with some other denomination/church that I’ve read about.)"
184,"It was $20,000 with all fees and expenses total. I have a great job and I’m sorry to say I sued the driver and his company. I didn’t want to profit from her death but I knew not only the loss of her income would affect us financially to a little extent but figured I would need to take a lot of time off if not retire to take care of the previous baby."
185,"Yes, at this point almost every night.  I wear diapers nightly.

Does your S.O. wear diapers, or do you just do the laundry?"
186,I agree with you
187,"Well, this is a child we're talking about.

They likely have no concept of cost, value, poverty, or anything else.

He just thinks everyone has a lambo in their garage, and the babysitter didn't think to bring theirs. Probably thought his suggestion might be helpful, even."
188,If ckNcis7392hdiw Nckao!\£badlands
189,"There have been repeat questions and a lot of information presented as factual posted my the OP that actually is false, but was cleverly worded in confidence relying on people’s lack of will to see if it’s legit. Therefore, this makes the AMA trash."
190,This is the coolest AMA ever!
191,"Why? You understood what I meant? And the purpose was to get you to understand what I meant with the comment. Therefore going back to change it would just be a waste of time since it doesn’t change the end goal, which was successful."
192,"Our first learning of it was when the US Army discovered them. The villagers only described what they saw as strange train activity. More frequent. But they were afraid to comment because it meant certain death. Also very astounded. I didn't know. We couldn't believe it. Those horrors, how they found those people gassed."
193,"If it is to be his final moments, spend as much time as you can with him. I hope he comes out okay, let us know! Thoughts go out to you and your furry friend"
194,"I am so very lucky to have my mother and sister beside me.
The vast majority of my family are also non religious.
I can only imagine how difficult it is to leave and be completely on your own."
195,"This used to bother me, now I know they're just doing what they're told to do and think is the right think. I even fear for their safety. I'm an atheist but when I have cash on hand will give them a little, i know has isn't cheap. I'm also very polite and tell them I'm not religious. My mom is a Christian and has became friends with 2 that come to her house. They're usually pretty nice people, they get treated pretty shitty by alot of people tho. I guess I just want them to know that just because I'm not into their religion I'm not an awful person."
196,Thank you.
197,They live on a rebuilt earth where everything is perfect for a thousand years. After that the satan is released from the abyss for a short time to see who he can trick again.  If you make it through the second time you get eternal life.
198,"Never. I've wandered into many exchanges and flea markets, telling myself I should get one to finally complete the never ending childhood trauma, but every time i'd clam up. I hope I get the courage one day, dont know why im so scared to buy one lol"
199,"Thinking about it, it's not really that scary, but spending my whole life being told that all your friends and neighbors will be wiped out because they don't believe the exact same thing as you probably messed me up for life."
