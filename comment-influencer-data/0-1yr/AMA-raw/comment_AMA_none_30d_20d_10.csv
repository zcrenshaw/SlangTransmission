I'm not only registered, but i paid for premium for a while."
9,I'm sad for you but I hope you find reason to smile again.
10,Really? I feel like crab is one of those things I can never “overeat” it’s actually one of my favorite things to eat now because it’s so filling my so light.
11,"Take care of house, cars etc. cook the meals, play video games, workout."
12,"I'm afraid not, seinfield is on my watchlist though!"
13,Yessir
14,"Unfortunately without a post graduate degree it is very difficult. The pay is low as well, and it's not particularly interesting work where I am in the UK. 75 percent of my course are going into professional fields that have no relation to marine biology at all (recruitment, sales etc)"

16,What was her reasoning for blaming you?
17,"I hate and do not support their lifestyle, but I have nothing against them personally and if I meet one, ill just treat them like anyone else."
18,"Gotcha. I'm assuming because your bill won't be much, if anything at all. 

Are you in a big hospital? Is it far from your home? How does your family feel about your diagnosis? Are you going to have a long treatment path?"
19,Nah I agree with that opinion to much shit is what I've gone through to not agree with that

21,French. It’s not as exciting but my accent lets me get out of talking to people
22,Are you receiving care in the US?
23,Not yet but we will see
24,"I’ll talk to my tax man and see what my options are, thanks for your input!"
25,Interesting
26,Have you thought about what you're going to do after you leave the army?
27,"Why is family different from other ppl? Do you have empathy for family or you imagine that you should care about a steady environment of ppl that you have used to? 
Have you ever imagined hurting ppl? Is anything stoping you? 
Was something in your life that made you a psychopath or you where born this way?have you ever felt anger ? Is sex important to you? 
Does watching animals getting hurt make you uncomfortable and why? 
Have you ever been close to empathizing to someone? And if yes how was it?
And lastly if you had the chance to be able to empathize ,would you like to change or remain as you are?"
28,nope
29,How do you feel about gays ?
30,Yes
31,"yeah, i found that out. this one lets anybody tell lies to get attention."
32,"Not OP, but also Russian. Yes, vodka is a popular beverage, and a lot of people drink every Friday after work. I don't have a lot of stats, but Russia has a high consumption of alcohol.

And yes, a lot of people are driving carelessly. Driving 5-10 km/h higher than speed limit is basically the norm, just as driving during the first couple of seconds of the red light, and I hear a lot of reports of drinking and driving. Again, don't have any statistics, but that's from my experience. Also, roads are really bad here. Main roads are maintained relatively well, but smaller roads can be in terrible condition for years, and the government does little to fix them. There is, for example, a hole in Novosibirsk that has its own twitter account, and this hole is 3 years old..."
33,"Twice, but technically 3 times."
34,What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
35,"How did it happen? Who suggested it?

40,Statistics are bullshit. 75% of people know that
41,"I know my sister has a sex life. Doesn’t mean i want to see her naked or watch her have sex.

I saw your other comment about how you don’t care if anyone sees your bits and that’s fine, you do you. Having pictures like that floating around can cause not only embarrassment but it can also affect employment chances since employers nowadays like to search your name on the internet to get background info."
42,"You seem a little lost, kid."
43,The 380 for Emirates! Dumping the lavs is so gross!
44,It's very efficient and all natural

48,That sounds like fun
49,Hooligan is amazing!  Only had it once but yeah that stuff is brutal.  My kinda stuff.
50,What about your background is interesting?
51,"Good question. Using 18mg liquid it took about three or four weeks for the desire for a cigarette to go away. It was not comfortable. It was not fun.

However it was far better than many times I tried to stop cold turkey. Stop smoking drugs did not work for me. 

I consider myself ""morbidly addicted"" to nicotine- I used cigarettes for 30 years. Which is probably why I was not able to separate from the nicotine. Although there are other chemicals in tobacco that are addictive or psychoactive so I only went through a partial withdrawal."
52,Why you sad boi
53,Don't you speak ill of the flame-shirted tip froster or be banished from the kingom of flavor.
54,hungry and gay
55,How does your family feel about it?
56,"Mold on bleu cheese is harmless.  It's part of the fun!

Plant based cheese has yet to impress me.  It just doesn't have the right flavor or texture yet.  

Low sodium cheeses can be made from the get go.  Once the salt is dissolved in the cheese, it can't be removed."

58,I've only been to a few WF but I've heard their cheese selection is very good.

60,Yeah. Before when people think I am being annoying and they say “What are you? Autistic?” And I’m just like “no shit”
61,"Dont take it as an insult, sounds cliche, but autistic people just tend to think about shit in a different way"
62,"Strange, I've heard in a song that Sweet dreams are made of cheese..."
63,Not even close. Lol.
64,Thoughts on Whole Foods cheese sections?
65,Tasted like the blood of murdered Indians.
66,Why did you decide to start the taper? 1.5 MG of Xanax isn't high enough to cause impairment.
67, ...but thigh highs are my demise?
68,I’m a guy who’s mother want me to learn how to cook basic meals so can you tell me the recipie please
69,Second cousins.
70,"Yes!! I could use a permanent vacation. 

I enjoy it. Been doing it for 5 years or so. And I have started teaching my friends how. 

I have heard of breaking bad. Never saw it. I very much enjoy 'the good place' , and Lucifer. But my favorites change like the weather.

I have not heard of the author or the book. I prefer horror. Anything Stephen King or Howard Phillips Lovecraft. 

Never heard of the movie either... Hmm. Anything classic 80s. Goonies, princess bride, back to the Future, Ghostbusters, trading places.

Piercings or tattoos?"
71,"Chechnya is another thing.
But yeah, this is hella terrifying.

74,"We was together for almost 4 years now and we have never had a fight or anything, she wasn’t gonna cheat, i wasn’t gonna cheat and never none of us would ever have. We met through one of her friends (an ”ex” who was unfaithful)"
75,Hell yeah!
76,"Is your only NSFW post your midget torture one?

77,"It depends on which family member. My immediate family support us, and our choice to have children but they call him cousin daddy. My extended family didn’t know until we told his mother I was pregnant. It’s been about three years now so, we are strong and just getting stronger."
78,"I don't really eat cheese, so who am I to disagree?"
79,"Cotija, Oaxaca, or Fresco?"
80,"Not really. We natives can be kinda prideful to a fault. What everyone sees as a lose to a war with the french, we see as a defense from the french that lasted TWELVE years. We might have lost, eventually, but we put up one hell of a fight. 

In today's day and age, it's not so bad but back when the reservations were first started, their ""let us help you savages"" was pretty brutal. Thankfully we're not thought of as stupid barbarians anymore. 

That's a really complex idea to think about. The arrival of the Europeans really turned the Americas on their heads. I would like to think that it would be similar to Africa but some native tribes were pretty darn advanced. So I can't imagine they wouldn't be somehow in the midway point between what Africa is now and what America is now. But honestly, it's really hard to say."
81,my mom and sister had suspicions of which were based on very flimsy evidence that just happened to be true. My dad was completely cueless though lol.
82,"I don't mean to take over, but I just moved to Connecticut from living nearby [Nordic Creamery](https://www.nordiccreamery.com/) and I am always bummed when I don't see any in stores here. Probably too much expense."
83,"Sure you can, try harder."
84,"Yeah my school is all about being employable right out of high school so I feel like I do have real-world job skills especially since I'm AutoCAD certified. I personally have no idea what I want to do but I will be going to college unlike a lot of my friends who were in Construction, HVAC, etc and are going straight into the workforce. My school is so big on the real world that architecture class was the most stressful thing ever... it made me not want to pursue architecture anymore. A lot of my friends got jobs at architecture/engineering firms senior year as part of the co-op program and they're gonna continue their co-op job as they go to college for architecture."

94,"I was on 1.5mg Xanax for 3 years.. when I started my taper I switched from 1.5mg Xanax to 20mg Valium. I would take the Valium half in the morning and half at night. I decreased my dose by 2.5mg every month. When I got to around 10mg I was feeling bad and stayed on that dose for 3 months as I didn’t want to increase my dose again. I carried on decreasing my dose by 2.5mg until I reached 2.5mg and then I decreased it to 1.25 after a month and then I jumper. The taper took me about a year. Weirdly enough I was feeling the most lethargic and had beach aches at 2.5/1.25mg and I was so scared of jumping. But the night I skipped my 1.25mh dose the next day I felt so clear headed like it was euphoric. I stoped taking it and just started feeling better and better as I’ve been off benzodiazepines for nearly a year now. During my taper I thought I was literally going insane with all my thoughts, body aches, headaches, neck aches, light sensitivity, depression, anxiety, brain zaps... but nigga we made it!! 😭"
95,"There is no way Russian government *cough*Putin*cough* will ever allow any mass protests. He will shut them down before they even start. I personally believe that’s why Russia got so involved in Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia were brother countries. So if Russian people see that Ukraine starts living better when they go with Europe, they will turn to Putin and be like umm excuse me but you were saying West sucks and look at our bro Ukraine over there. They started living so much better with them"
96,dsfsd
97,I started the taper because I was sick of the withdrawal symptoms. 1.5mh daily is MORE than high enough for impairment as that’s a high dose for anxiety which I was taking it for. Other people who take 2mg+ and binging on 6mg are either suicidal or just feeding their addiction to a much higher extent
98,Yeet yourself
99,I don’t remember I remember an Irish one from my step grandma don’t remember the words exactly
100,"I'm a fan of bleu cheese, who among the larger manufacturers do you believe makes the best bleu?

102,Any specific cheeses you had that for?
103,I am lactose intolerant. Is it true I can have certain cheeses? Thoughts on non-cheese like Daiya?

112,"On Bumble (the dating app), women have to write the first message. Then, guys can reply. Tinder? Either can say hello first. It wasn't sleazy hook-up chat. I was kind. Polite. But we both knew that it was about me traveling, and their physical wants / needs."
113,"Ah ok. thanks for the info.  How do you feel it's helped, hindered, or changed your behaviors?  Any ... side effects ... that people don't like to talk about?"
114,Are you white?
115,I see you're from the Mile High City! What Denver cheese shops or restaurants should I check out?
116,Jesus Christ. Screw all that. I had a fight break out between these guys because one made fun of the other for not graduating high school as well as mocking his favorite nba team. All I knew was there was a noise complaint. So when I get down there these guys are about to start fist fighting and their friends are asking me to break it up. I was like “wtf am I supposed to do?!” So I just kept walking and called the police. But apparently they calmed down before the cops arrived. Next day room was trashed. Paintings knocked off walls and stuff. At least they don’t know me or care to know me. Stay safe!!

121,"Having Bipolar is an exhausting rollercoaster.  There are times when your mood is as elevated as possible (mania/manic episodes) or as depressed as possible.  For the record ""as elevated as possible"" is far more serious than merely being in a good mood and ""as depressed as possible"" is far lower than 'ordinary' depression.  Bipolar depression is at times akin to human hibernation.  You can sleep for literally 3 days straight.  You're at times too low to even be suicidal.  When manic, though your behavior comes off a loony, it's merely that your mood is elevated to the point where nothing is off the table, if you will.  Your consequence and foresight switches get bypassed.  Hence, spending money you don't have impulsively to the point of being overdrawn by $1,000.  You'll stay up for 3 days and still have energy.  You'll think of starting a million projects at once, hook up with a stranger out of state that you met online, give your belongings to strangers, etc.  It can look like mismanaging, irresponsibility and such but in the moment you can't stop it.  It's not until we come down from an episode that we look at the damage and are dismayed at what took place.  When manic, some people's brains get so overloaded that we dissociate or have psychotic breaks.  Dissociation feels like a dream and like you're on autopilot.  Imagine daydreaming times a million.  I have never experienced psychosis though, so I've never thought I was God or anything.  Typically the mental and physical exhaustion of being as revved up as can be during mania will inevitably lead right into the Bipolar crash, followed by a depressive episode.  Bipolar and substance use issues tend to go hand in hand.  We're not trying to be immoral or anything but we're subconsciously trying to manage our moods by taking in what brings us down a bit or up a bit.  We are not psychopathic or sociopathic.  We don't murder people.  We don't have multiple personalities, etc.  We are not dangerous and frankly, we're irked that media portrays us as such.  Though yes, during our manic episodes we can be wreak havoc on our own lives.  Our mood fluctuations make it remarkably difficult to hold down a job, hence being allowed to claim Social Security Disability if Bipolar.  We can't handle the job stress that others take for granted.  It spirals us back and forth between manic and depressed to the point where we're mentally and physically exhausted.  We inevitably have to resign very shortly after trying a new position.  People with Bipolar tend to have a very messy resume and last between 2 weeks to 2 years, typically.  We feel like the black sheep of society and are often misunderstood and stigmatized.  To make matters worse, though medication can help a lot, your mood can still sway a bit too much in one direction or the other, simply due to things in life that are unavoidable.  Excess stress without enough downtime causes us to spiral but you can't help if someone close to you unexpectedly passes away or your neighbors were too loud so you didn't get enough sleep.  You can't prevent the change of season and so on.  This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  Here's a great example.... due to my sister unexpectedly being rushed to the hospital, I'm sleep deprived and am posting on Reddit at 4AM while chain smoking and droning on.  Though it takes years to learn to self identify, I can tell that my lack of sleep and being overstressed has me in a hypomanic state, a level below full blown mania.  I quite possibly may need a psychiatric hospital soon if I don't get my sleep/wake schedule back on track and begin to decompress with adequate downtime.  Many things others take for granted, we can't.  We need at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  We can't skip meals.  We need to be diligent about structure and routine.  We can't isolate too much and risk spiraling into depression but we can't overdo things either and risk triggering mania.  It's a very difficult illness to manage and it takes a lot of determination and strength to go on.  People with Bipolar should hardly be viewed in a negative light but much rather the other way around, if you really think about it, lol"
122,"Appreciate it man. I’m dialed in, it’s been such a long processes."
123,Aww thanks mom. I didn't know moms used reddit I thought it was just kids. You're the best.

136,tbh it’d a wild situation to be in that’s for sure. you ever find out what happened to the person selling the ganj? annnd what happened to the blow dealer?
137,"This is more the creepiest thing, but:

I had to cover second shift for someone, and then take a Lyft home (only 1 car, and the kids dont need to be woken up at 11pm to pick me up from work). When I get back at 630 the next morning the Night Auditor tells me that he had to have the police remove 2 people from a room upstairs because of drugs domestic abuse, but the third person with them was not removed, as he claimed that he had nothing to do with it, and the cops were ""sounds legit"".

Third Guy was my Lyft driver the night before. 

Third Guy wanted me to extend the reservation a couple of nights (i assume so he could try to get his buddy out of jail), but the reservation was not in his name. I told him there was nothing that I could, that the hotel was booked, and he had to be out by checkout that morning. 

Then the guests that initially reported the domestic disturbance came downstairs an hour and a half later. I apologized for the issues, gave them a discount, and asked them what happened the night before.

According to them Third Guy getting back to the room was the catalyst to the issues the night before, and was screaming and swearing and throwing things upstairs right at that moment.

I call PD again and ask dispatch to come remove him, and tell Housekeeping to steer clear until I give the okay.

When the cops show up they come to the desk to tell me that Third Guy Definitely Did NOT Have Anything To Do With Disturbance Last Night. 
I said I didnt care and that I just wanted him out, he was trashing the room now.
Cops insist Third Guy Is Not Being Arrested, He Did Nothing Illegal.
I say I dont give a damn, get him off my property now.
Cops say This Has Nothing To Do With Last Night? Okay, Third Guy Is Just Getting His Things Now.

Then I realize that Third Guy is a Lyft Driver, knows where I live, and could potentially be selected to pick me up from work again.

Had to contact Lyft, and explain the situation. Put Third Guy on our Do Not Rent List, and I was worried for a couple weeks that Third Guy might show up to my apartment and try to confront me."
138,"I won’t say the exact amount, but I was making about 8k-10k per month. There’s a seasonal effect, but considering everything, then I’d say that estimate is pretty solid. When I got “caught” I amazingly didn’t have to do any jail time since I was young at the time, but I did have to comply with an agent and turn in basically everything I used to produce them."
139,"From reading these comments I saw you live in Washington state and I’ve gotta say... I don’t blame you for wanting to stay up 5 straight days. This place is boring, but what do you usually do for “fun” here?"
140,"&gt;By ""fear of the consequences of his overthrow"" do you mean fear of not being a dictatorship or fear of not being lead by Putin?

First, but not only. Lenin and Stalin, and Yeltsin all fucked up about democracy and a good life. It ended with that shit.

Therefore, let Putin be better, I say once again the standard of living in Russia is higher than you think here. Because at reddit they try to do only the negative side of Russia.

Therefore, all talk of revolution, the overthrow of power. This is nonsense idiots who do not understand anything in life. Like the author of the post.

Which was directly asked about the return of Crimea to Ukraine. This idiot was not ready for him, ahah. Therefore, ordinary people will not go for such. Putin will calmly correct until the end of his presidency. Yes, you can say that this bastard deliberately brought us into this position. But why should I go after idiots who do not even know how to get out of it?

All they say is so similar to the nonsense of the Communists in 1917, or the lies of the former Communists in 1991."

177,But people live longer so why wouldn't the pension age go up ? Russia isnt loaded like the US is with money they can print indefinitely. What would you suggest instead of raising the pension age ?

If playstation, have you played The Last of Us?"

185,How does partners react to your fetish ?
186,"No offence but that’s all a load of shit. First of all, do you not see the hilarity in your statement, “you trust people everyday in the form of elected officials...” 

Ummm really? You trust these people? They are quite literally enslaving your mind. They have taught you how to think, how to behave, how to vote and how to give half of your pay check away. And you happily do it. Blind obedience. 

The younger generation has one of the highest amounts of self awareness. What?! These people are the epitome of unaware. They are consumed by emotion and fear. Self awareness is to practice mindfulness. To believe people are born with this is simply not true. 

More people seeking mental health services than ever before.. a testament to how sick the millennials really are. And can we agree this is directly related to their unstable parents? Thank goodness for more and more social services popping up. However I doubt a bandaid will help."

190,that’s good! i’m assuming you’re either not first cousins or are very lucky then
191,What do you want to talk about?
192,I'm doing pretty well :)
193,The quality of the cheese isn't necessarily dependent on where you get in from.  I know Eataly Chicago has an incredible selection if you don't mind giving that slob Mario Batali your money.
194,As an amaricain I think that the reason is we don't nessarily have the capacity to go against Russia and it's allies and I had no idea what was happening
195,When ?
196,Oh I’ve never been to a Costco
197,"Didn't your dad or your family ever felt guilty for earning life at the expense of those girls? at the cost of her depressions, drug addictions and rapes? Fiercely contributing to a sexist industry that boosts the degradation and objectification of women?"
198,I have a Stag AR15 love that rifle. Just checked out Extar and that fits the bill. Just wanting something to plink with that doesn't break the bank for ammo. Thanks.
199,😔
200,"They're all from the same family of cheeses: Grana.  Made in similar ways.  The difference is the types of animals used to make them and where they're from.  Cheese has terroir just like wine.

Romano is typically a Sheeps Milk cheese (Pecorino), Asiago isn't aged for as long as Parmesan (usually less than a year) and Parmesano Reggiano is a legal term for cheese made from a certain type of cow in a certain region of Italy and produced in a very specific way.  It's a DOP cheese which is essentially a trademark and cheese needs to be made to very stringent standards to qualify."
201,"Nice, that’s a good one! I like the one where it starts, and there’s stuff happening where they’re talking and then it ends."
202,sadfASDFGSADF
203,Lots of stuff besides this. I pop on to this account ever couple days to ask this question
204,Maybe I'll have to it.
205,"can I ask, why do you hate women?"
206,"Long aging does not a great cheddar make.  Buy an expensive 2 year from Neals Yard and that should hit the spot.  Cabot's higher-end line is also very good.  If just pure sharpness is what your after, I've heard that Pinconning makes a super sharp cheddar, but I don't know if it's any good or not."
207,"In the end It's about values, of course no one likes to loose money, but a lot of things are more important than money though."
208,"I honestly loved it! It's a county school so I got to meet a lot of different people and my school was so diverse that white people were actually the minority (\~80% of students were black, hispanic, middle eastern, asian, or mixed). My parents wanted me to go because it has better education than my district high school and I wanted to go because I used to really want to be an architect and it was the norm to apply. 

My graduating class was about 790 kids. Each class starts out with roughly 1000 kids. If you fail 3 classes in one year or fail one year of your major class (we call them shop classes), you get sent back to district (we call it RTD for ""return to district""). However, starting the class of 2022, there are about 1300 kids in each class because of our new STEM research majors (Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Life Sciences) which are different from our original stem majors (Computer Science and Engineering). So the student body is roughly 4,000 kids I would say..."
209,I’m sorry
210,Sure
211,"What kind of process and timeline does it take to earn this certification? It sounds very exclusive and professional (especially with a ""valid until"" date)"
212,"How does it feel living in a country where most people are allowed to carry guns with them around? Is it ever scary? I Get the impression that most people feel safe because they can carry a gun and protect themselves, but do you ever fear that someone could be standing right behind you and shoot you?  

Sorry if the questions are poorly formulated"
213,"No wine and went straight for the dine, yeah?"
214,"Ahh, okay 👌🏻"
215,"KL, Malaysia"
216,""" sexual urges are well known to warp people's decision making in unpredicatable ways, and you don't know who you will be in the future"" 

In that case everyone should just kill themselves. Anyone can be a bad person in the future, to prevent anyone from becoming a bad person everyone should just suicide then, correct?"
217,Ok
218,how to watch free
219,Do you think it is needed that people can Get so many weapons? Because if all you want to do is protect yourself (which is the impression i Get that most americans want) do you really need anything else than a smal handgun?

221,Why aren’t you in school?
222,What a waste of perfectly good pecorino :(
223,"I live in Chicago, I know Wisconsin is the cheese capital of the Midwest but is there any types cheeses local to me that I NEED to try or I don’t realize how great they are fresh instead of store bought? I haven’t really ventured out to try different types of cheeses really"

r/usernamechecksout"
238,Anything wbu
239,"You can have values and self-interest at the same time, my friend.

The answer to your original question is yes."

241,I don't have to answer when you're asking questions in bad faith. Go meme someone else.
242,"Any cheese aged longer than a few months should have very little, if any, lactose.  You might want to try a firm goats or sheeps milk cheese."
243,how to watch
244,Have you ever lost a game of tic tac toe to a child?
245,"I won’t say the exact amount, but I was making about $8k-$10k per month. There is a seasonal effect but considering everything then I would say that estimate is pretty solid. When I got “caught” I amazingly didn’t have to do any jail time, only because (I’m assuming) that I was young at the time and didn’t have any ill intents. I did have to comply with the agents and turn in every single thing that I used to produce them."
246,"Ti ruski my ass, I can't believe how many People believed this moron."

259,"I realise I didn't quite answer your question with the first one, so let me try to explain it in depth.
Do you know that feeling of watching a show which has been there your entire life, but then suddenly the creator died and someone new has to fill in the position of that person. Now there is a new season and you watch it but it feels like something is missing... Something is off. The characters are still the same, the jokes are of the same sort as before but something is just... Off.

I fear that after Endgame, I will have the same thing happen to the Marvel for me. I don't want the story to end like this, I want to keep seeing Stan Lee Cameos but that won't happen anymore (RIP Stan Lee, we are thankful for what you created).

I just don't want the see the peak of something I love and then the downfall afterwards."

268,I've been told those are the best African men.
269,"We usually don't use radar guns on stretches of unlimited speed, because... why would you use them? But since normal patrol cars mostly don't go over 250, and he was much faster, my guess was 320 (like 250, 320 is usually one of the standard speeds where manufacturers limit cars)"

I haven't done the pins yet. I'm waiting for the next person to cut me off while driving. I'll pin it and toss it at the car. 

Stickers got stuck on a notebook and who knows where that went. 

Next time I go I eyed a crappy jewelery machine and might get a new bracelet. Why not I guess."
311,"Remeber this was written after an armed rebellion, and the intent of this is to protect the people from a tyrannical government they had just escaped. This is why I think the people should be well equipped to deal with the American government."
312,"I sometimes make my own mozzarella at home, but for whatever reason there are times that I can't get the curds to coagulate. I think my problem is the rennet. I use Junket tablets because that's what my local store keeps in stock. Do you have any suggestions on a better rennet I could be using?"

b) I make myself laugh all the time and feel so dumb afterwards. It's mostly while I'm talking to someone and I'm being absurd trying to get a rise out of them and they start giving this ""...and here he goes..."" face and so I just get ridiculous and end up laughing at my own stupidity.

III) Why thank you. And they are pretty similar. Trying to figure out just what to say to a specific group of people to get the desired effect from them without saying something that'll get you fired. Plus you passed the bar exam, I just try to pass the bar."

323,"Omigod, you might be onto something."
324,[removed]
325,Have you ever had someone check in that was *definitely* a criminal?
326,Aight
327,"Thank you so much! Glad to hear i actually have someone like a idea of mine XD. It's still in the early stages at the moment. Writing scripts, coming up with names, getting co hosts that sorta thing. But it will be happening!"
328,If you want to make an amazing expensive pizza? Straight up fresh buffalo mozzarella.  It’s expensive but slice that up into little coins and place all over (like ALL OVER) the pizza.

341,"Could be better, could be worse. I percieve the world normally, but with more stress and anxiety. I try to take some things people throw at me as advice (even if it isn't really). But to be honest, i dont really know how EXACTLY i percieve the world. I think everyone has a different point of view"
342,Can you teach me some Portuguese swears?

353,"To ligado, vc ta em qual ano (ou já ta na facul)?"
354,De nada 👍
355,"Not a question, but no you haven't. At 16 years old, there is no way you can know who you will want to be with in five years, let alone 30. Be with that person as long as it works and move on when it's necessary."
356,"I also lean on the aspergers side. Especially with being social, AKA my lack of"
357,"I appreciate it. And I hope you are doing well,  I grew up in a household that was mainly Christian based values but it was never pressed on me. I’ve gone to church a handful of times but never found what most people look for. I do irritate people when I say I do believe in a god but also evolution so it does make for some interesting dialogue and conversations."
358,"In all honestly, it makes me feel like shit. I have cravings all the time and just want a cig. I can’t sleep as good and always want one. This is so far anyways, heard it gets easier and better."
359,"Eh, religion has always been more personal to me. If what you believe fulfills you, that’s exactly what it should do.

I suppose I’d consider myself more agnostic because I’m not abhorrently opposed to there being something else, but I just don’t find that I am missing anything.

My parents are very religious, but for the wrong reasons. They are religious simply because they’re afraid of a hell. 

If they’re irritated it’s likely because they aren’t fulfilled by what they believe and feel that you, too, should be unfulfilled."
360,I want a body
361,"Quick warning. It's REALLY LONG and the fandom is considered one of the worst (well, in 2012)"
362,Mainstream TV channels make USA look like an enemy. That's why quite a large part of the population thinks the same and I don't share this opinion.
363,How much does it weigh?
364,"i like america’s immigration policy, surprisingly. i understand trump has a lot of haters but i don’t think all the criticism he gets is true. for example, building the wall to separate america from mexico. i genuinely have no clue why that stirs up so much calamity. do people want mexicans hopping the border? it is very well known that this occurs a lot and i actually know of people in the california area who knows for a fact this has happened. 

psychological impact, surprisingly, hasn’t been so potent. if anything, i’d say it’s mostly humbling. you see how poor you are and back home and how dangerous things are and wish to come to america for a better life. however, since moving to america i’ve noticed there are different kinds of struggles (obviously not to the degree of back home, but you get it). people here are much more arrogant and depressed and it actually makes me miss home. how have i been coping? just taking it one day at a time"
365,"S(he) must suck your penis very well, eh?"
366,"That’s good for you, really. As someone who is an Atheist that’s never had any major tragedy (outside of the normal human condition), I have great respond for people who keep/find faith through adversity."
367,I used too feel bad about it. But i've finally just stopped caring about people's made up ideas about me. So i've accepted it at this point.
368,"I work wholesale and I'm starting to get tired of the grind sales takes. What keeps you motivated/do you get a base salary or is it all commission based? '

&amp;#x200B;

Also do you get leads generated for you or is this all cold calling?"
369,Favorite cheeses out of wisconsin?
370,Xd
371,Would you support increased gun regulations in Texas?
372,Are the fries and cheese thing still going on?
373,What's the most fun ridiculous pitch to match?
374,Your welcome
375,Definetely bummed. School sucks the life out of me.
376,"Basically I just felt nothing, I felt completely hollow from the inside and I just wanted to feel something again. I don’t know how far I got before being stopped because I usually passed out and I woke up in the hospital and I never bothered to ask. I hope I answered your questions correctly"
377,"I keep playing with the thaught of getting an entry - level drone for FPV flying (only in remote, uninhabited and safe locations, obviously). Any suggestions on what to look for gear - wise? I mean, like what should I keep in mind when picking a drone?
