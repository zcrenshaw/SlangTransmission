0,"It was my 2nd day and I was shadowing but a guy was checking out, I was going a bit slow and he starting going off and saying that I should know what I'm doing and they being new isn't an excuse...

The policy is that I can't punch him though :(

**EDIT:** Be patient too you have no idea what we have had to deal with throughout the day so far."
1,"They're great, most Walmart stores (mine specifically) have been using old and outdated hardware for so long. The self checkouts are always requiring a cashier to be overshadowing the customers to prevent theft and money laundering.

Many people believe they cause us to lose jobs but it's quite the opposite."
2,"STOP BAGGING MILK.... A PLASTIC HANDLE IS STRONGER THAN SOME FLIMSY PLASTIC BAG!!!

No but seriously, just talk to us and give us something to occupy us. We are standing in one place for hours on end so just give us something to focus on or just wish us a good day too!"
3,You're 14. You haven't lived most of your life. Calm down lol.
4,Probably someone falling for a scam and the scammers have asked them to pay with gift cards :(
5,"No idea, but various people will attempt to buy a large amount of small scale items at self-checkout. They think that they are checking out themselves so they can do it without being caught...

(FUN FACT: WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING YOU DO FROM OUR SCREENS.. WE CAN ALSO TAKE CONTROL REMOTELY)"
6,"I specialize in the field of computer sciences, I know these all too well and I asked him what the use was and he said that one was for his son and one was for him. I believe him by his attitude he seemed to know what he was talking about."
7,What are some sketchy items people buy?
8,How does one launder money at self check out?
9,"I am going to have to call bullshit on this. Maybe if you had evidence, sure. But until then, I doubt it"
10,"Honestly, people have various types of lifestyles but to me when someone is loading up a gift card or a prepaid card for some service... that's sketchy.

I had someone load up two Steam cards with $200 each the other week."
11,"It's usually since a computer will generate the shifts that everyone is working. They try to get many people as they can on the registers but it's difficult to find people at times. You may often find CSM/CS on registers (often identified by yellow vests rather than navy blue) and Walmart would rather have a CS/CSM (Customer Support/Customer Support Manager) be helping customers than running a register.

**EDIT 1:** Walmart is probably one of the best Super Centers to work at, in fact they offer a bonus check after every quarter which will give you up to 125% increase in your check. This depends on your attendance though, 1 absence will lower it down to 100%, 2 will bring it to 75%, 3 will deem you incapable of receiving a bonus check, and 4... well at 4 you are then fired.

**EDIT 2:** They also provide associates with a discount card they can use, which allows them to receive 10% off any purchase, and around holidays you get 25% off of one whole purchase. This only is allowed to be used with you though (and a spouse/husband) if you share it they will actually fire you."
12,"He didn’t know. I’m not sure if you saw the post I made a few minutes ago, but I’ve chosen to keep most aspects of my illness a secret from everyone except my parents. My friends, brother, boyfriends, grandparents, etc., don’t know about any of it except for things I can’t hide (ex. Major surgeries.) I’d rather live an authentic life than one brought on by others’ pity. I’d rather him dump me than stay with me because he feels bad, you know? Don’t wanna live a lie"
13,They would love you over at r/ihavesex
14,"Probably Dr House because even though he’s unethical and I’d never act how he does, he’s pretty entertaining and smart!"
15,"NEVERRR, but yeah I always ask first if they want a item bagged. I never assume."
16,How’d you get hired?
17,"Nobody besides managers usually do, unless you've worked there for ~1.5+ years.

Nobody is designated to stock the whole store. Most people have to restock certain areas, and may never see the other locations much.

Cashiers rarely know where most items are unless they've been there for a long time."
18,"A full grown man (\~230 lbs) who was pretty hairy wearing a skirt and leggings...

He bent over his cart and I can never unsee what I saw that day...

**EDIT:** I have seen cos-player(s) in Walmart though..."
19,Why do I spend approx 30 to 40 mins taking a poo
20,Is using self checkout for a bunch of small things bad?
21,So have you actually been diagnosed with ASPD or are you just an edge lord?
22,What could customers do to make your job easier?
23,"At my local Walmart they recently opened 18(yes 18, they're numbered) self checkouts and there are only 2 remaining tradition checkouts(which are closed and without a cashier half the time), the self checkouts usually only have 3 or so people watching over all 18 tills. How would this layout not cause people to lose jobs? When they had half the amount of self checkouts they still had about the same number of people manning them and now they significantly less regular cashiers so surely there's less people working."
24,How do you buy two couches by accident?
25,"I don't know but I can tell you this.

Walmart policy is that associates can not take ANY type of gift or item from a customer. If a customer wishes to not receive the change they owe, or insist on giving you a tip. You are strictly prohibited from accepting the tip. All associates who receive any type of tip in the form of physical cash must be deposited on the ""Donation"" box on the way out when they end their shift.

This applies to my store, I'm not sure about others."
26,How does that work? What is up with those ppl who accidentally bought two couches?
27,"I work in a Walmart located in Upstate New York.

I do not wish to specify the exact store due to me being under the age of 18."
28,It's easier to carry bag handles up stairs than it is milk handles. Stop not bagging my toilet paper!
29,"Customers Service desk here, how goes it my fellow Sam Worshipper?"
30,"Dear Customer Service Desk,
   I hope you have had your fair share of ridiculous item returns :*"
31,"Try also r/IAmA


Saying ""I am a first aid volunteer at the recent HK protests, AMA"" or the like should suffice


Note that you'll need a photo proof, so maybe upload a pic of your vest or equipments, with your username on the side."
32,How would you describe your overall experience working there? Does it take a toll on your mental health? Someone I know hated it very much
33,"No, I wish people who are coming in to order 30+ packets of Koolaid would use self checkout...

Honestly though it's easy to tell money laundering against somebody who is just purchasing items.

Money laundering usually will be small items that can sell such as phone chargers, USB wall chargers, SD cards, etc."
34,Can we please open all the damn registers?
35,"I have no idea if its like this in your store or if this just applies to my state, but every walmart I've ever been to (and even worked at once as a 3rd party sales rep) only has like 2 cashiers working at a time and like 20 other closed down lanes. Why is it like this? The two open lines plus self checkout are always overflowing with customers. Is the company just that greedy?"
36,I'm very interested in how you game with just your mouth! Is it voice commands?
37,Open interviews.
38,DUDE I just saw it for the first time last night and it was amazing.
39,my nigga
40,Why don’t the Waltons give more to charity?
41,"Yes, just yesterday someone tried to return items they got from Target. With Target receipt. Guy was high af."
42,"You tell me!!! People keep posting on our local Facebook pages selling things like an extra couch or a car bumper they ordered by accident. 
It seems to have something to do with Amazons ease of ordering and things like ambien but with Amazon’s return policy I have a hard time believing it."
43,"True, I can’t deny that they removed the fence and bricks from the sidewalk. Which mostly is public property and some belongs to construction firm.

However, I’m not an expert in violence, I can’t give you a perfect answer.

My POV, protestors need a barricade to protect themselves from police officers who have batons, shields, guns, tear gear, etc. 

Please consider the difference between the armory of police and improvised measures of protestor. What weapons do they have? 

Some carrying hiking cane made of aluminum, mostly carrying umbrellas made of lightweight metal.

A few protestors have slingshot, but I have never seen one by myself, only from vids and photos that overly used by pro-Chinese government media, 

Molotov’s cocktails were witness to explode in front of me, but I do believe only a few protestors dare to carry them, as police were doing search everyday. I think only a maximum of 3-4 Molotov’s were used per protest day.

Let say they use 10 Molotovs per protest day, how many shots of rubber bullets/bean bag rounds/tear gas rounds the police fired? I stopped the counting since June, because they kept firing.

Dominated by violent protestors? In my POV protestors are losing the game of violence cause  police kicks protestors’ *** in every single protest. 

The police officer’ve beaten them up on the street, in the mall, in the police station, and in the jail. While the protestors were outnumbered, under controlled and hands tied up. 

I agreed this is a place of miracle. As far as I know, no shops were damaged by the protestor, which is a miracle. There is jewelry, gold and valuable goods that they could take in the name of riot. 

So I don’t know where did you get the ideas of destructive acts and damaged properties. 

Those properties are mostly owned by the government.

Those acts are targeting government.

And when peaceful protest doesn’t work, they improvised. 

Check the umbrellas movement a few years ago. That’s how a peaceful protest went south. And those people who negotiated with government were sent to prison."
44,"Fun fact Alice Walton, one of the heirs to Walmart, has been in multiple car accidents one of which resulted in a death and even though multiple witnesses claimed she was speeding at the time she was never charged with the murder or any crime related to the accident, she also has had multiple DUI but has never had her licence taken away even after hitting a gas meter and driving into a ravine. The officer who stopped her after the murder claimed she was clearly drunk, he later wound up losing his job and never testified in court."
45,Edge lord lier who makes himself out to be James Bond and a super genius AMA
46,And now I can almost garuntee your just lying. Just stop.
47,Can we please get more associates?
48,"Please be wary of [agent provocateur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur) tactics; there is no better way to vilify a movement or group of people than this. 

Still, there will always be assholes. Focus on the movement’s message and not the assholes."
49,"See the thing is the milk jug sweats, putting it in a bag keeps the car dry and also keeps things like sand or dirt from sticking to the jug."
50,"No. I lived most of my life believing a was perfectly normal, my first diagnoses was only in December 2018."
51,"My parents are very supportive, but aside from my parents, I’ve made the decision to keep my illness a secret as much as I can. My friends, past boyfriends (aside from 1), and even my brother and grandparents don’t know about it. I want to live my life as me, rather than the girl with brain cancer who’s gonna die soon, if that makes any sense. I want my experience in life to be authentic, not brought on by others’ pity."
52,I live in Upstate New York so you could only image the rush we get around there.
53,"I'm not going to say sorry cause I bet you're tired of people saying that to you, I'm just going to say that you better do what you want to do, say your heartfelt goodbyes, and live every day like it's your last, you won't be forgotten, at least not by the people that really care about you."
54,"Most of the cashiers will be moved to Customer Support or will be having alternating shifts at the self-checkout. With traditional registers you could just turn off your light and go to break but you can't leave self-checkout unattended.

If they can't fit you in as a cashier they just allow you to choose somewhere else to be placed."
55,Can you describe your incel days and post incel days? What changed?
56,Not according to this morning's news. It may hit the Carolinas instead.
57,Where do you work?
58,Stay mysterious and confidence. The less she knows about you the better. This would put you having power in the relationship which should be the aim.

62,Can u blink
63,"i’m trying to figure that out too but i think its like FOMO. i used to think it was because i was sentimental that i kept the table napkins from places where we’d go out to eat in high school (think: a box full of napkins, box full of food wrappers from food people gave me back then, box full of test papers in my friends’ handwriting) but now i’m not sure but i just know that it makes me anxious to not give in to my compulsions."

78,"If it were an option, would you want to be part of a union to bargain for better pay and working conditions?"
79,"It's quite a good job, they offer above-minimum wage and they allow you to work multiple positions, you have to wait 6 months to apply for other positions but you always have the option to switch where you are. You just have to be fair about the fact that it's a job and it's not a hobby for a reason."
80,Did you get laid ?
81,"Almost 90 percent on rotten tomatoes, nice! Thanks for the recommendation I'll check it out while munching on fast food tonight"
82,"I never thought of this until now. It makes me incredibly sad. 
Just yesterday i was discussing with my friend how every woman has fear of being raped and the thought creeps up in so many situations. Something we start feeling from a young age and is always there. 
It (unfortunately) makes sense that for blind woman the fear and risk is greater 😥"

96,Ask someone on the floor and not the cashiers. They stay up front all day and don't go on the floor generally. However the Walmart app has a map of where things be.
97,"Truthfully, I feel like better pay would be nice. I am fine with 12.76/Hour though so I am content and being 16 and having this as my first real job, I can't complain."
98,"I worked at a grocery store in a small tourist town, and while there were occasional customers like this, most were laid back.  Locals for sure, cause that is the way of life there, but most tourists were happy to be put of the hustle and bustle of city life.  Could not imagine being a cashier in a larger city."
99,"Thank you! I’m an atheist personally, but I truly appreciate it"
100,"I just wanted to say that having nursed people with glioblastoma, I am very sorry you have this horrific illness at such a tender age. Your outlook is admirable... there are many avaricious, unpleasant and downright evil people who could learn from your humility and honesty. Many adults wouldn't cope with a diagnosis like this. I dont have any questions, I just wanted to say that and wish u all the best. 

BTW - if I have seen anything as a nurse prolong the lives of those with terminal illnesses, I can honestly tell you, its been positivity. So keep going, and don't limit yourself, and don't do anything you don't want to do!"
101,"Everyone's experience is different on the Autism spectrum, but for me, I just take in information in as simple of a way as possible. Most people seeing a sunset would be like ""Hey, that's a beautiful sunset!"" and I would probably say something like ""That's a sunset. The sun is setting."" When you take information that way, it's really hard to form a connection, or show an emotional response, or for anyone to care about what you say. Conversations are always the hardest thing, because saying something interesting is nearly impossible when you see something as just ""what it is"" :)"

131,"First off, I would not recommend keto. As you stated it is not sustainable and it can make you feel sick. Stick with an even balance of carbs/fat/protein, use the percentages from a reply I made above. Stick with a lower calorie diet, it does make a difference even if you can’t see it right away! I would also recommend trying weights, it is much more fun than cardio and don’t be intimated. If you still do feel intimidated, get a friend or family member to work out with that can spot you. Additionally, lifting weights helps reduce fat but actually builds muscle, in contrast to cardio which burns both fat and muscle. Remember to eat low calorie foods like white meats, fish, or even starch based carbs like rice which can fill you up quickly because of the water weight. How much weight you lose in a given amount of time is dependant on your body and hormones, but trust that you can do it, because you really can!"

But no military was found involved in the uniform during the protest.

And I don’t know if there is spy or undercover military personnel. 

But yes the actions is like a threat towards us. And I believe protestors don’t want to negotiate with a government who threats her own citizens.

The last question you asked, I wish there is an answer. But sadly I don’t think those alternatives were allowed by the Chinese government. The 5 demands the protestors asked seems to be forbidden.

And perhaps, a Tiananmen 2.0 

If that’s happened, we expected."

158,"Some of the long term stuff is mostly related to radiation. I have hypothyroidism after the radiation zapped my neck, so I have to be on meds forever. The worst side effect is only having 60% of my lung function due to radiation scarring. If I get chest congestion, I really really can't breathe, and have gone to the hospital. There is nothing I can do, it's like untreated COPD that has no treatment. Doctors said it will get worse and I will have to be on oxygen later on in life.

I cannot drink alcohol, because my liver and pancreas just cannot process it without putting me in pain. I know there is a cyst there. That was a result of not only drugs, but because of the IV nutrition I was on, which is really hard on your liver. 

Some medium-term side effects (5-6) years were mostly psychological. I struggled with PTSD and flashbacks for a long time but I haven't had a flashback in years. Also I sometimes struggle with somnophobia (fear of sleeping) because in the hospital I was woken up every 30 minutes and I wasn't sure I would wake up again. These things seem to peak around the corner when I'm VERY stressed, to this day. 

With the stem cell transplant, my immune system was distroyed and reset. I used to get sick A LOT. Now, I guess it's more of a 12 year old immune system, pretty average.

161,"I have varied definitions of myself. The most true to myself would be a being of energy. I’ve seen myself without the shell in hallucinations. This is what we all are, energies in a reality. There may be multiple realities. The least true to myself would be saying that we are all Homo sapiens, a byproduct of evolution, with no real purpose other than to keep evolving. I have no recollection of being born, so I would rather believe I am energy. Also it just sounds cooler. Edit: I know there are layers to reality.

Ps: so, do you live in Flanders or Wallonia ? Thanks for the AMA good luck Out there"
164,He says he hasn't seen a psychologist professionally so it's still a very real possibility that OP hasn't even been diagnosed with ASPD or conduct disorder and is just autistic and antisocial
165,"I once boosted myself on my non-prime account on wingman from unranked to master guardian by playing with an 11-year old who would constantly die while I did both kills using a mag-7 on the map lake as CT by simply going upstairs and I'd get the enemy's ak47 and give it to the 11-year old while I'd constantly buy mag-7s


About T, idk. Smoke bomb + plant + sawed off I guess."
166,I'm female actually but thanks so much for your input! :)
167,"Hello! 1. It depends, It doesn’t get payed badly, me and my family are living solid middle class life but becouse Im travelling a lot becouse of my job I don’t see my family as much as I would like to. 2.This is always a bit different, if I wouldn’t count the time every part is being made and everything put together (since I have nothing to do with that, so I cant really tell, I usually just get to the construction and everything is there for me to start actually constructing the elevator) just the construction It usually takes about 7-9weeks (5days a week 8-12hour shifts) 3. If it would be about some elevator accident then maybe I could save someone being stuck there otherwise absolutelly not, usually if there is someone stuck in the elevator the technicians are the first ones to get called there and get it sorted, in this time if something happens to the elevator usually no major injuries are occuring since there are so many safety laws and parts that there is such a small chance of something really bad happening. 4. Honestly that is a good question, nobody knows what is going to happen but in my personal opinion I think that the elevators won’t change that much, I think there will be more hydraulic elevators than mechanical with ropes and stuff (we are doing mainly mechanical since its cheaper than the hydraulic ones) but since the laws are really tight about safety of elevators I think there will be more and more safety parts added overtime but ai dont think the elevators will change that much. Hope I answered your questions good enough and hope you are having a great day! :)"
168,Can I ask you anything actually or is this false advertising
169,The one which doesn't make me obese
170,Are you worried?
171,Who was the dumbest person you came across in that time?
172,"What was it like immediately after the accident? 

When did you realise the gravity of the situation?"
173,Don't level up resistance and practice rolling to avoid enemies.
174,"Title says shot in the head, description says shot in leg and hands then continues to talk about brain damage..... You say you won't tell us a lot, but will tell us anything we want to know....."
175,"I had the chance to do this (bard college at simon’s rock) mostly due to how awful high school was going for me socially.  I opted not to and actually really enjoyed my junior and senior years of high school, my peers grew up and so did I... as people get less insecure they don’t take it out on the easy targets as much, (this stays true of people who remain insecure but compared to pubescent boys the majority of the population gets a bit more self assured after puberty I think).  

I’ve always wondered what it would have been like if I’d made the other choice like you have... I think I would have encouraged myself to use that extra time to study abroad even longer than the year I spent in Tanzania and Ecuador.  Being the same age as your peers and partying was something that didn’t interest me until those last two years of high school  and now I’m 32, a new dad, and finishing up my PhD in the next couple of years.   I don’t party anymore, haha. But I learned a lot and am glad I had the experiences I gained (both good and bad) from experimenting with my brain (drugs and alcohol) and if I had quit high-school when I did I think it would have taken me a lot longer to come to the conclusion that most people aren’t assholes... the ones who are are just louder.  

I hope everything works out for you and I hope you use your extra time to do something you love... maybe even try to make it into a career!  It took 7 years of jobs I hated to go back to school to study venomous snakes and start trying to make a career out of my academic hobby.  There is plenty of time to mess around, don’t let anyone pressure you into missing out on your chance to make mistakes.  It’s better to learn who you are and what makes you happy or stumble and hit rock bottom when you’re young and relatively unattached than when you have a family and career that will suffer if you figure those things out when your much older (I’ll introduce you to my dad!).  Good luck and Godspeed!"
176,How badly has this ostrasized you from family and friends?
177,Hows life?
178,I was around 6 so I didn't know what that meant I just remember hearing crying from the other room and asking what autism was so I guess confused and worried
179,"It was just glimpsed over, but one said a joke about how there has never been a forced volcanic eruption. But even I think that was a joke. There is a chemical that does not interact with inferred light(at least not as much), my memory seems to be heading towards a nitrogen based molecule, kinda like the opposition of greenhouse gases. They will dust the sky's with it. I can not remember the compound name but I will see if I have the notes around me. Also I'm not a chemist so take the science with a grain of salt."
180,Do you get patients questioning your position because your a female?
181,Time well wasted wasn’t wasted at all
182,born like this. I like to say my twin sister ate them in the womb
183,How many hours a day do you have to work and what is your PG in?
184,"I started the Dark Crystal series. Kind of interesting, might be worth a watch for you"
185,"Oh you mean my masters? I did it in endocrinology research.

Yeah it’s good, my hospital sticks to the European working time directive (average 48 hours a week)"
186,"Ill give an analogy, life is a game of chess. There are pawns, working everyday jobs, minimum wage. These pieces are disposable to the king. They live and die to help the upper pieces, this is their design. There are knights, the educated, they move sporadically, make jumps in advancement. Very important to the advancement of the game. The bishops, once was the church, dive deep and get a few special pieces to change the tide of the game . The rooks, the media, they are sturdy and can save the king and queen, while also making devastating attacks and  usually apart of the game winning moves . The queen, theses are the politicians , they are powerful and can take out, easily the most influence piece in the game. The king, the ones making the calls, the ones with the money. They tell people where to go, they are the corporations that make the world go round.

You start as a pawn and you move forward eventually reaching the end of the board and turn into a bishop or a rook maybe a queen. But never a king, you can never get to the top unless it is needed for a new game. 

But there is one thing left, one thing that is always unseen. When you are playing the game as the pawn, or rook, or even king. You are so focused on the game that you never look up. If you would look and observe that there is a hand, making every move. Never by your own accord. The board is made a certain, your piece can only move a certain way.

When you are the piece you are part of the game, why would the piece ever want to leave the game? For the game has given it purpose. Or does it?"
187,"The sole reason for these societies is to keep the masses at bay and following a system. To keep the average Joe mindless doing what they believe to be the right way to happiness, when in reality they are entering a cycle has been designed to be inescapable, to trap people and make them preform a certain way and do certain things. This keeps the people at the top up there, not the way it suppose to be."
188,"Everything you do in modern society has been plan, your birth to your death. Well not you individually, that is to much work. But your childhood is ran by parents who have the views of the system, the education system teaches what we want. You go to higher education to be future trapped. 

Society teaches one thing. You need money to be happy.

You need a job to get money. You need and education to have a job. Money for the education, so you must work more. You work more to finally pay off that education to have a good job to make money. It is all a plan, set forth by your parents, who have been taught by their parents. It is a cycle perfect in design to make people believe they are not in a cycle. Society tells you want to do, and people are trained from such a young age to follow society that it is all they know. It is a prison where you do even know you are a prisoner cause you have never seen the outside."
189,!remindme 5 hours
190,"None to be honest, they accept all."
191,This makes perfect sense. You're a brave one. I wish you all the very best. I'm not the most religious person but I've just started up again and I will keep you in my prayers
192,Yeah don't worry. There won't be any Time Turners for these guys.
193,"Oh really? I thought it was fairly mainstream as a thing! (Asexuality) but maybe :). And thank you so much! You have no idea how much that means. I'm used to people being negative about it so your encouragement means a lot! You're a golden person!

Hugs"
194,Opinion on checking receipts before customers leave?
195,I answered that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoklie/)
196,"Lol, I was wondering about this as well. Tons of similarities"
197,"I used to play the guitar, but one of the side effects of this is I tend to have trouble with rhythm. I don't dance and failed my guitar class in high school because I couldn't play a song properly and keep up with the rhythm. I've not tried to play anything else, but I feel it'd likely be equally as frustrating lol."
198,You're not wrong whatsoever
199,"General sounds can invoke emotion, for example the sound of a car braking suddenly would make me jump and I'd definitely feel shaken, surprised, etc. if it were near me. The only thing that doesn't invoke any emotion is music, so if I'm listening to a super sad song, I'm not feeling anything. It's just noise essentially. Sometimes the lyrics can get me if they're good and I'm paying attention, but at that rate I'd rather read the lyrics like a poem in silence.

EDIT: Same applies to any emotions from music. I don't feel happy, sad, excited, hyped, anything like that just from a song."
200,"The NHS is the best, despite its faults. No way would a privatised system be better, I shudder to think of it. Even if it would mean I earned more, I wouldn't want to make that switch and have patients be worried about how to pay for their healthcare. I strongly believe healthcare is a right. If I ever did private practice it would just be a side-project."
201,"Got it. Hey op, are you single?"
202,It's our job...
203,"Why do all books have to be based old-fashion? Like jfc is it too much to ask for meta books like Apollo (which uses lol and different internet stuff) or EditingEmma (which is ALL about internet)? Oh well, whatever floats your boat I guess, but at least give the wizard a gandalf vibe by making him say “You shall not pass!”"
204,"Not OP, but Netflix (and also other services like Hulu, Prime Video and iTunes) offer a feature called audio description, which involves an additional audio track where a narrator describes the visual aspects of movies and TV shows that would be important to follow the story. You can try it out on almost all Netflix original content. Many sighted people find they like using audio description when they're doing chores around the house or driving when they can't look at the screen."
205,You ever been to old zealand?
206,do you have a favorite hentai?
207,Which country do you prefer U.S or Canada
208,Yeah sure 🤪
209,"My family is more hostile, I've lost all my friends, and I know for sure no uni/job will want someone who looks like me. Every time I open up about my insecurities ppl encourage me to lose as much weight as possible"
210,"I'm a first responder in the USA, how are you guys holding up? I know you've seen a lot of stuff lately, how are you and the others you work with doing mentally? 

Would you leave Hong Kong, or send your family out, if you could?"
211,"You're right a crucial factor here is proper nutrition to accompany the exercise, are you following a particular diet and do you keep in mind eg the risk that animal proteins (and a lot of protein in general) bring to a body?"
212,"Not daily, I try to go 5x a week, not weekends. It’s hard because I don’t have a ride a lot of the time, with full time working parents and all. I don’t go daily because rest days are when you actually gain muscle. If you have any gym super close by that you can bike to, go there."
213,"Absolutely no problem! I’ve only ever smoked bud, popped molly and drank... other than that, no. I would like to try DMT, but i wouldn’t know where to get it, so it seems unrealistic at the moment! That’s my top one so far."
214,"And how it helped my condition helped me: I almost never had any friends before I realized that I didn't wanna be viewed stereotypically for my entire life at around 14, and I just passively started altering how I thought, acted, reacted, and showed myself, including through body language. Basically kind of altering myself to an extraverted introvert. Based Zeus on youtube is a golden tip for this btw. Other than that I can learn things super fast if I really think that I should be able to, weird to say but eh."
215,"To your question about how I see others. They are in a lower level of reality. They don’t see the truth, therefore I can manipulate them with ease. Their minds are weak."
216,"All of those are things non psychopaths may do too. Surely extremely difficult to self diagnose because  a psychopath wouldn’t view his behaviours as a trait of a psychopath, he’d see them as normal. Traits like high self esteem, high estimation of self, lack of empathy, and a need for constant stimulation and admiration.  How would a psychopath see those as psychopathic behaviour and not ‘normal’.  Many of those conditions are also found in other mental health disorders as are all traits of psychopathy - pathological lying, manipulativeness, juvenile delinquency. Psychopaths maybe aware they are different (and better then others) but wouldn’t see it as psychopathy because they wouldn’t see themselves as having a mental disorder."
217,"No, I was talking to the other guy."
218,"This affected me soo much that I couldn't maintain my grades at one point and also lost all of my interest in my hobbies, it's hard to socialize because of our age gap since all of them are teenagers lol. I remember in highschool I was bullied almost everyday I won't go into detail for now and also my advice for the parents out there just encourage your child, Unlike my parents they just compared me to my other classmates that also skip 4th grade."
219,Really good actually! Much better then the last few months
220,Would you rather eating a juicy burger with a turd in the middle or a shit covered burger that’s pretty tasty on the inside?
221,"How are things?

How’s the rest of this year looking for me, do you think?"
222,"What do you mean by that, do you mean me or the patient? And what sort of accident?"
223,How can I edit it?
224,"5 years technically, but I took a year out during the process to do a masters so it took 6! It was good, obviously there were stressful parts but I really enjoyed medical school overall. Loved the uni life, made lots of friends. Came out of my shell a bit. And definitely enjoyed learning all the cool medical stuff"
225,"Oddly enough, I don’t really have one. I’m really into music though and go to a lot of concerts between surgeries and such, even have been lucky enough to meet a lot of people who’ve helped me keep pushing. Went cliff diving a year ago and am performing at Carnegie Hall in April. I’d like to travel more in the ~2 years I have left as well."
226,"It actually hurt quit a bit. The cold was oddly enjoyable in an erotic way, but the thing about a flesh light (although I've never used an actual one) is that it's a squishy rubber material. Ice is absolutely not. Putting your penis into something hard like that is not pleasurable."
227,Why doesn't anyone who works at Walmart know where anything is?
228,"hi I am also Autistic, tho I have learnt how to control it over the years, still snap sometimes.

If I may ask how severe is your autism and what age are you at?"
229,Someone tried giving chicken to CS the other week saying they didn't like the taste of it so they wanted to know if they had to pay.
230,who was your worst customer youve ever had
231,"Good tip as well, I might do it tomorrow since it is  midnight here in Hong Kong.

Sadly I can’t post my vest and my pouches I’m using, as someone (the authority, to be specific) could trace back to me. But some retired one should be fine."
232,What are the requirements to apply for a job at Walmart?
233,How was he able to dump you knowing you're terminally ill?
234,hell in what way? If I can request
235,What video games do you play?
236,"oh yeah memory is shit sometimes. 

And whenever I think I got the hang of my memory I forget stuff again a moment after."
237,"No lmao I wish, a year!"
238,"omg yes.

Writing down number is literally hell. And dont even think about math"
239,Ok
240,Your Walmart ever shut down because of Black Friday?
241,You're asking the wrong guy pal... You should probably ask a CSM or CS
242,DUDE I just saw it for the first time last night and it was amazing.
243,"1. Do you like your job and does it pay well to support your living expenses?

2. How long the process to start from scratch when building elevators?

3. Does your qualification translate well if you want to become a firefighter?

4. In your prediction (and it’s okay if you don’t know the answer), what does the future of elevators look like?  Will your job be obsolete to catch up with the demand of “futuristic” elevators?

Thank you for taking the time to answer questions."
244,"Enjoyed reading your AMA. I have recently taken my joy of scuba diving to a new level with an organization called the Dive Pirates Foundation. They are a non profit scuba diving organization that teaches paralyzed and amputees how to scuba dive and have a team of people assist those divers on some fantastic trips. 

I never knew this was possible but I am eager to travel and dive with this group and help others live their dreams of diving.

Anyways. I just thought it was cool that I was literally doing my training coursework yesterday and then saw your AMA today. It's amazing how the world can be adapted to still allow someone such as yourself the opportunities to do some pretty cool things!"
245,"Alright, the part where he said he had cannibal friends confirmed that he is lying."
246,"I've been treated well so far so maybe I'm lucky!

I treat them like as any other patient. They're the same as any other patient, they are just often much less fortunate in life than I have been."
247,LOTR fan?
248,Nope. If I die it's %100 murder. RIOT IN THE STREETS
249,"Cool, that's really lovely to hear and thanks for replying so quickly. I hope everything goes well in your career and I'm sure you make an amazing doctor, and will continue to be. What you do is wonderful!"
250,I personally drink it everyday.
251,You know this thing with a pot and a kettle?
252,So you guys got a union yet?
253,"Did your brother ever give out hints that he was in pain?

How old was he?

How was your relationship with him?"
254,What's the best test you've ever had?
255,Your description really needs some periods and commas... it’s impossible to understand what you’re trying to convey.  I think you got shots?  TDaP?
256,Please be careful
257,Sink baccy cones g?
258,"How's Battlefield? I've heard good things. Send a link when you're done I wanna check it out. RDR2 is good but it's not the usual type of game I play it definitely has its own pace. 

Honestly Minecraft mobile is good but I have nothing to compare it to. I've only played it on PC briefly and not enough to give a judgement. But for mobile, for what its worth, it's not bad, keeps me busy haha"
259,Can I get the Frozen stuff in a separate bag?
260,Is there anything equivalent to the US occupational safety and health administration where you construct elevators? What are building inspectors like over there? How strict are safety regulations?
261,"I didn't think you weren't capable of a google search, but here you go

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"
262,"I hope so but I takes a long time to have appointments and after the surgery you have to wear a eye patch for a few weeks
And there's a good chance that the surgery doesn't work, but I'm willing to take the risk"
263,I knew you were a bot
264,"Now I want to get Minecraft on my phone! &amp; when I'm done with it I'll send you a link! 

Battlefield4 is fun. Some of the servers are weird but it's fun to snipe, especially in ""hardcover"" since any body shot will kill. The free aim took some getting used to. But switching back to rdr2 after makes me realize how crazy the aim assist is on rdo. And I've changed my settings drastically after playing both."
265,"Some people might not listen but it's worth a try. Also no one said that this person needs someone as a lover, a friend can be enough. You are actually a despicable person for giving a person shit when they are trying to help someone. We literally know nothing about the one who wants to kill themselves so we can't fucking go on anything, all we can do is hope that this person gets help. Your comment makes this sound like you're trying to turn this into some kinda sexuality thing or about yourself."
266,Always have. I’ve known her since I was 4.
267,"That's true. Where do you keep your stuff? You don't have a locker? 

Point I'm trying to make, is don't let the front end be your only view of WM. You make yourself more valuable to the customers by doing something as insignificant as just learning where things are in the store. It will also help you, should you want to be something other than a cashier. I started as a cashier, &amp; learned everything I could, in order to move off the front end. Now I'm the Claims supervisor &amp; don't really have to deal with customers, unless I'm doing the clearance aisle."
268,DISGUSTING
269,What kind of software do you use?
270,"when I see french flag all I can hear is ""don't shoot we surrender"", that's how white color sounds."
271,Whats the chance of you lying on here
272,"How do you recognize another psychopath? 
How can someone who is not a psychopath spot some warning signs?"
273,Where do you live that you can be diagnosed with a personality disorder before adulthood?
274,When did the disease start to manifest? How did it affect your education?
275,How many times do you go to gym? I don't know if I should go daily or smth (i'm 14 too)
276,[removed]
277,Does it pay well?
278,Ask me anything
279,You don't write like someone that's hyper intelligent.
280,"It depend where you are and when, the kitchen smells like bananas and or dead fish, kudu smell like mud pies, flamingo pit will smell like water or poop, polar bears exhibit smells kind of like snow, buffalo smell like bo, and there are many other places but those are the most memorable"
281,It was a traumatic experience for my family because he was loved by the kids and us. My wife trains dogs and he listened well. I like having a life and my other dogs are finally happy and able to play freely.
282,Low fat cheese?
283,"A lady who wasn't stopping her kid trying to stick his hand through into the leopard enclosure and got pissed off when the guide respectfully said that if he was going to be disruptive, he had to leave."
284,"I'm gonna let you read through the link again, this time start to finish, and then you can make that request again"
285,"The Ehlers Danlos did when I was really little, the very first symptoms that show are being extremely bendy, bruising easy, poor coordination and dislocations or getting hurt easily. So I was always doing weird tricks with my body that other kids couldn't do like putting my arms backwards, my legs behind my head, my fingers pushed backwards can touch my forearm, etc. I was always spraining my ankles, I dislocated my knees constantly. Unfortunately doctors never thought anything of it and I just got diagnosed with EDS a year ago (which is EXTREMELY common which is HORRIFIC!!!!!).
My gastric issues, migraines, and chronic pain started when I was around 13 but we're pretty mild I'd say. The Dysautonomia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia and neurological symptoms started at 18.

It's also really common for people to have autism, learning disabilities, etc with EDS. I had really bad dyslexia, horrible with directions (like knowing where things were/how to get places) and avoidant personality disorder. I got my GED at 18, but I never learned past like simple algebra"
286,Oh wow. That’s a whole new level of stupid
287,"Oh please most parkour experts can jump from 3-story buildings with barely any harm. 4 stories fall on your back. Tho I'd have to ask, have you ever considered getting help from an expert (aka. Therapist)? I mean, they did 6 years of college to solve your mental problems for a reason."
288,Yeah really 🤣🤣🤣
289,"What a dumb thread.  Sounds like your dog is not adapted to life around others and will continue to be a problem.  It's not the dogs fault, but it's probably too late.  Don't abuse the dog anymore ,please, just have it euthanized humanely.  Anger at animals is very pointless.  They have no idea, they are just animals."
290,"What a well put together and believable argument, you sound like a cold and calculating psychopath, and there shouldn’t be a doubt in anyone’s mind that you aren’t. /s 

You’re inconsistent."
291,"Knowledge is power, I do not think one man can do anything. However, many with their knowledge can. They know it is only a matter if time before they decay but they never plan to go down easy. Who does when you have power?"
292,what video games do you like to play?
293,"What is PG? 

At the moment I’m usually 8-5 Mon-Fri with the occasional on-call in the evening or weekend"
294,How far have you come on your bucketlist ?
295,How old are you?
296,It's not your fault it's just those idiots around you. Yes idiots is a strong word but it's what I'm going for.
297,"Be grateful...
New York has banned the use of plastic bags, and customers will be required to purchase the Walmart brand cloth bags if they don't bring their own due March 2020."
298,"I’m really big into all kinds of rock, alternative, and indie stuff, rock especially"
299,That’s the plan!
300,"So you can lean towards the register and along the side is a cushioned padding so it isn't bare metal in your pelvis/chest.

Red lining means you stand at the end of your register and when customers pass tell them that if they're finished, you can check them out."
301,"For what it's worth, you absolutely nailed the spelling of allosaurus. This entire AMA is fascinating and really gives me a new perspective on those without sight. I saw in another comment you're an advocate for the disabled and I'm just stunned at how positive you are. I'm disabled as well, though not blind, I use a wheelchair, but it's really refreshing to run across another ""disabled"" person with such a great attitude."
302,"Orientation is mostly your rights, what you are allowed to do, and how to handle situations such as personal relationships with other associates and your codes for various situations.

Most of your training is done in a online course.

They don't give chairs because I find it quite impolite to be honest, they make you redline too which means you basically wave down customers. You also can not lean (unless you lean forward they have a cushioned padding on the front)"

---------|----------|----------|
What is your opinion on Self CheckOut?|They're great, most Walmart stores (mine specifically) have been using old and outdated hardware for so long. The self checkouts are always requiring a cashier to be overshadowing the customers to prevent theft and money laundering.  Many people believe they cause us to lose jobs but it's quite the opposite.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyo8sin/)
What are some sketchy items people buy?|Honestly, people have various types of lifestyles but to me when someone is loading up a gift card or a prepaid card for some service... that's sketchy.  I had someone load up two Steam cards with $200 each the other week.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoeu8n/)
How’d you get hired?|Open interviews.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyogztk/)
Who was the trashiest customer you ever had to deal with?|It was my 2nd day and I was shadowing but a guy was checking out, I was going a bit slow and he starting going off and saying that I should know what I'm doing and they being new isn't an excuse...  The policy is that I can't punch him though :(  **EDIT:** Be patient too you have no idea what we have had to deal with throughout the day so far.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyo9lia/)
What could customers do to make your job easier?|STOP BAGGING MILK.... A PLASTIC HANDLE IS STRONGER THAN SOME FLIMSY PLASTIC BAG!!!  No but seriously, just talk to us and give us something to occupy us. We are standing in one place for hours on end so just give us something to focus on or just wish us a good day too!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyobmly/)
I have no idea if its like this in your store or if this just applies to my state, but every walmart I've ever been to (and even worked at once as a 3rd party sales rep) only has like 2 cashiers working at a time and like 20 other closed down lanes. Why is it like this? The two open lines plus self checkout are always overflowing with customers. Is the company just that greedy?|It's usually since a computer will generate the shifts that everyone is working. They try to get many people as they can on the registers but it's difficult to find people at times. You may often find CSM/CS on registers (often identified by yellow vests rather than navy blue) and Walmart would rather have a CS/CSM (Customer Support/Customer Support Manager) be helping customers than running a register.  **EDIT 1:** Walmart is probably one of the best Super Centers to work at, in fact they offer a bonus check after every quarter which will give you up to 125% increase in your check. This depends on your attendance though, 1 absence will lower it down to 100%, 2 will bring it to 75%, 3 will deem you incapable of receiving a bonus check, and 4... well at 4 you are then fired.  **EDIT 2:** They also provide associates with a discount card they can use, which allows them to receive 10% off any purchase, and around holidays you get 25% off of one whole purchase. This only is allowed to be used with you though (and a spouse/husband) if you share it they will actually fire you.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoiket/)
Where do you work?|I work in a Walmart located in Upstate New York.  I do not wish to specify the exact store due to me being under the age of 18.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyobn9n/)
What’s the wackiest outfit you’ve seen|A full grown man (\~230 lbs) who was pretty hairy wearing a skirt and leggings...  He bent over his cart and I can never unsee what I saw that day...  **EDIT:** I have seen cos-player(s) in Walmart though...|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoklie/)
Customers Service desk here, how goes it my fellow Sam Worshipper?|Dear Customer Service Desk, I hope you have had your fair share of ridiculous item returns :*|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyolb7u/)
How would you describe your overall experience working there? Does it take a toll on your mental health? Someone I know hated it very much|It's quite a good job, they offer above-minimum wage and they allow you to work multiple positions, you have to wait 6 months to apply for other positions but you always have the option to switch where you are. You just have to be fair about the fact that it's a job and it's not a hobby for a reason.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoleul/)
What did they say about unions during orientation?  Why won't they give you chairs?|Orientation is mostly your rights, what you are allowed to do, and how to handle situations such as personal relationships with other associates and your codes for various situations.  Most of your training is done in a online course.  They don't give chairs because I find it quite impolite to be honest, they make you redline too which means you basically wave down customers. You also can not lean (unless you lean forward they have a cushioned padding on the front)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyolnha/)
What are the requirements to apply for a job at Walmart?|None to be honest, they accept all.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyolwz1/)
who was your worst customer youve ever had|I was trying to check a lady out and the till was empty (there was no money nearly), and a lady was waiting for them to get money from the money recycler but it was a busy day and the recycler was empty and they had to get it somewhere else, well a lady decided to insist I check her out when I had no money, and then she bitched at me when I told her I had no money in the till and she would have to wait for her change, even though I told her before I checked her out.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyomqt0/)
Why doesn't anyone who works at Walmart know where anything is?|Nobody besides managers usually do, unless you've worked there for ~1.5+ years.  Nobody is designated to stock the whole store. Most people have to restock certain areas, and may never see the other locations much.  Cashiers rarely know where most items are unless they've been there for a long time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyoh9q5/)
Why don’t the Waltons give more to charity?|I don't know but I can tell you this.  Walmart policy is that associates can not take ANY type of gift or item from a customer. If a customer wishes to not receive the change they owe, or insist on giving you a tip. You are strictly prohibited from accepting the tip. All associates who receive any type of tip in the form of physical cash must be deposited on the ""Donation"" box on the way out when they end their shift.  This applies to my store, I'm not sure about others.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/cxxtur/i_am_a_cashier_at_walmart_ask_me_anything/eyohsgj/)

304,"It's honestly the **BIGGEST** complaint I get.

I think they should restrict exits to be only accessible by going through a cashier lane first, they should block off all other ways to exit.

Where I live though, people ALWAYS get caught stealing though so we kinda need them..."
305,Thank you so much!
306,"I do not. I was raised Catholic, but I always had a love for science and quickly became an atheist as I developed my own thoughts and opinions. Totally respect anyone who believes otherwise, but I firmly believe that when I die, I’ll rot in the ground and be worm food, and I’ve done my best to come to terms with that."
307,"Can you enjoy playing music? I mean, you won't mind the sound that you produce but for some people playing is a lot of fun and don't mind the sound and same for reading tabs"
308,"Sorry you’ve been felt this card if life, your attitude to it sounds epic and from my experience that’s the most healing thing.

I’m curious how you discovered your conditions and were diagnosed?

Also, you mentioned you’d like to travel - any ideas where? :)"
309,"Yes, it is a terrible thing ): I always take every precaution to keep myself safe at all times though, so let's hope everything will turn out okay"
310,Top 3 best Canadian provinces and 3 worst Canadian provinces?
311,"Usually shooter or racing games, I've been playing Forza and Red dead redemption 2 this weekend. On my phone I usually play Minecraft, hbu?"
312,Just... wow. Time to evaluate your life.
313,"But is it with all sound or only music? Like you don't feel anything when a train brakes suddenly close to you or when a fork is rub against a plate or with a loudly background sound? 
You can't enjoy music but can you feel it? Like did you feel sad when a sad music is playing even if you dont like it?"
314,"When I was a cashier, many moons ago, we were told to walk a different route every day, on your way back to the break room, so you could learn the layout of the store. That way if someone asked, even if you didn't know exactly where it was, you at least knew where to send the customer to look. I work in the back, but on my way in or out, I walk different routes, so I can see if things in a department are changed up. If I get stopped, I at least have a fairly good clue where it should be located."
315,"How did it taste?

And what kind of dip do you think would fit more to the taste?"
316,She/ he is a 'real physician' - I believe Germany pays both doctors and nurses better than the UK
317,Why do Cashiers in America pack your groceries and why do you need so many plastic bags
318,"I think labelling it as a disorder might indeed be harmful to many of us, especially at an early age. I've not only been told that it's a disorder, I've also been told that it's a mental disability and that made me feel like an outcast and thus I isolated myself quite a lot. I felt ashamed of it. The word ''disorder'' has a bad sound to it in our society and when you're young, you usually associate that word with mental disorders like psychopathy. At one point I was afraid I'd end up being a serial killer because I've been put in that ""disorder"" box. It gets easier when you get old enough to differentiate."
319,Me too. I love the UK
320,"Abortion - 100% pro choice. I was kinda pro choice before medical school but my training definitely solidified it. Body autonomy is very important, possibly the most important thing in medicine. Also, pregnancy and childbirth are fucking brutal, so putting someone through that who doesn't want to is borderline torture and shouldn't happen in a civilised society. 

Euthanasia - I'm not as 100% on this, but I probably would support it. People don't deserve to suffer. I think it'd just be harder to implement - e.g. if everyone with motor neurone disease took the option, then would people diagnosed with motor neurone disease feel pressured to? And would it affect funding for research for some of these terminal diseases? Would people's families coerce them into doing it? Where do you draw the line - which diseases are 'bad' enough to warrant the option of euthanasia. What about mental illnesses? It's a very complex topic and very interesting to think about."

322,Poor eating. Get more fiber in your diet. Eat fruits.

For gods sake man. Grow up and realise women don't just dress in order to look sexy to men."
324,"I love RDR2! I play on PS4. I've been playing a lot of Battlefield4 lately though. I feel like it's more rewarding when you get a kill. But I love RDO and the online friends I've made. I'm making a YouTube channel for my rdr2 videos, I'm almost done with the first video. 

How do you like Minecraft on the phone? I never played it on any console but it has always looked fun."

336,"There is no such thing as emotionless. You cant turn your brain off.

You need to be emotionless to be a good liar.

Don't listen to such people. These self-diagnosed ones.

If they are so sure they have ASPD, why are they scared of going to a psych?

The psych failed them? They think they fooled the psych and hence they pass as a sociopath.

They are just fucked up. The plain old fucked up. Giving it fancy labels doesn't change that.

Keep your ego aside and welcome to fucked up land."
337,No I fucking love you more
338,"Surprisingly, no. Most houses I worked in I was specifically told not to open any drawers or boxes that might contain in them jewelry and other personal stuff. In offices, people don't put personal stuff in their room, they usually carry it with them in a bag (concerning women), or wallets (concerning men).

However, if it counts, I did find a pack of condoms and tampons."
339,Have you ever eaten bacon? Have you ever been tempted by bacon? Carnitas? Pork bbq ribs? You know?
340,Did you keep it?
341,"I heard that some people are born genetically predisposed to sociopathy, which is later triggered by environmental factors. Is there anything in your life that you think could have pushed you to develop this way?"
342,How do you feel about gay people?
343,"Sorry, not sure I understand this response."
344,"At what point did you realize the relationship was going to far?

Do your parents know?
 
If so how did they find out?"
345,What do you do when you’re sick?
346,ok
347,How did it happen anyway?
348,What is a vibe?
349,You're aware that you wrote the number 1. as in *one*

How did the authority’s find out?"
351,Lol I was an ignorant 13 year old
352,"&gt; Don't get me started on arts and crafts.

What do you mean by that? Is it that you don't like it or you can't relate? 

Are you creative?"
353,"To be completely honest both. 
Because my two best friends I had since childhood are Jewish and Christian and we were having a talk about religion stories from our holy books (yes laugh at me we were mature) and we were all like no way! That’s in my holy book as well. Still one of my favourite memories as a teen"

357,Can you eat burgers? What's your favorite burger joint?
358,Are you male?
359,You're full of shit lad.
360,How can Muslims trust a god that is know to be ‘the greatest deceiver’? Surely you are supposed to be able to put all your trust in God? Something that openly and boastfully claims to be the best liar of all surely sounds like it comes from Satan.
361,mostly lol. thanks.

My opinion and the Religious opinion.

376,"My mom received a liver transplant in 2008. She was At a meld score of 40, basically was within days of death.  My dad text me that morning, that they were sending her home from the hospital, nothing they could do.  

15 minutes later he text back, never mind.  We’re staying, they found a liver.  She had a rare blood type and a young woman was killed in a car accident during the night that was a match.

388,"Hello! Yes it does, to make it easier:

Ups: 
Plenty of work 
Not a bad pay
Nobody standing behind you and checking every five minutes on you
You get car and any possible tools that you just always have with you so you can use them at home when not at work
People are usually glad you are doing this so often they invite you over for a lunch/coffee or offed you water or some kind of drink while you are working

Downs: 
Big responsibility
Often carrying big and heavy things 
Some ppl are assholes and just bother you while you are working 
Lots of little things that you have to be extra carefull about
Almost always have to go 100 or more km to the town you are working at, so with family you are quite far away 

This is just from top of my head, hope I asnwered good enought tho, have a great day! :)"

390,"The first thing I would do is establish a diet. I’m guessing your male so a calorie deficit needs to take place. Average male should eat 2,300 cal while maintaining, so I would shoot down to 2000-1,900. This is on a non active day (a day where you don’t work out). On an active day, depending on on how intense your workout was, increase by 200-300 calories. Make sure that your eating an even distribution of carbs/fat/protein (don’t fall into fad diets, they often don’t work or are unhealthy or unnatural). You can find eating charts based on your calories online, but it should look like 45-50% of your calories from carbs, 20-30% protein, 25-35% fat. Moving on to workouts, you should do 30-45 min a day MISS (medium intensity steady state cardio) or 20-30 minutes HIIT (High intensity interval training) I started with MISS, because it’s easier to do when overweight, but as I got more fit I moved on to HIIT. Your cardio session should preferably be an entirely different session from your weight room one (but still on the same day). It’s still ok if you have to fit it in one session however, just make sure it’s before you start lifting weights. When you do lift weights, start a Push, Pull,, Legs workout schedule. You can find one online if you want. Good luck with you journey and best wishes!"

Many long time cashiers may know the whole store, cashiers do run reshops!

Reshop is when you take the unwanted items that customers decided they didn't want and you fill a cart up and play a game of how fast you can find where the item goes.

That is how you change it, instead of letting these few people have all the knowledge give it to everyone. Equal knowledge, equal power.

The Moth is unscripted stories told live on stage, Selected Shorts are great works of fiction read live by famous actors. Snap Judgment tells tales from all over the world. Tiny Desk Concerts are live music from bands you may know, and bands you’ve never heard of. The one that became my favorite was, Jay Som. She sings so beautifully.
