0,I’ll take weird over going to jail again any day.
1,"Well, if I met an interesting guy that just happened to have a micropenis I'd be absolutely delighted, that would be great 😂 But I don't want to choose my partner specifically based on the size of his dick..."
2,I don’t trust women for shit. I still go out on dates but I record them on video saying they had a good time.
3,Why not look for a guy with a micropenis? Then both of you would be happy.
4,"Dude, as a kidnap rape and torture survivor, I am so sorry. Let me make this clear; I am no victim. What happened to me made me a tough ass bitch. And it absolutely infuriates me when innocent men go to jail bc some fucking cunt decided to ruin their life over this kind of shit. It totally invalidates everything I went thru, not to mention ruining chances of TRUE attackers going to jail. I personally offer you my deepest apologies for the soulless, deprived monster of a human being that did this to you. I hope your pressing charges to the fullest extent of the law against this stupid cunt?"
5,No. In fact she later admitted to everything on Facebook messenger then offered to give me a blowjob. I took screenshots of the conversation and sent it to the cops and instead of arresting her they arrested me for retaliation against a witness for telling her I hope she gets hit by a bus and I was gonna sue her. I’m not kidding that’s on the police report.
6,That seems a little weird but I understand where you're coming from
7,See that’s the most horrible thing about all this... it makes it so real victims have a harder time being believed.
8,How did it affect the rest of your life?
9,Is he still chained in the basement or have you transitioned to letting him roam the house?
10,"Smile,It is the key that fits the lock of everyone’s heart."
11,"Yea yea, but you’ll never be as high as I was when I met Snoop"
12,Nor you as high as snoop was when you at him
13,"If you say they’re famous, then they’re famous. That’s how it works. Grandma makes the rules."
14,"DUDE YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!

i just told this dude i was gunna ignore him from now on bc he was asking me if my parents used to spank me as a child and also if they asked to see my boobs as i was growing up.

pedo vibes yes or yes

also what's with the parent thing"
15,"Pretty much all of them (~20). Most of them were only short aquaintances though. I tend to be quite upfront about my condition, I believe it's fairer for everybody involved. 
While I can say that none of these guys were disrespectful towards me after finding out, most of them immediately lost romantic/sexual interest in me. Which is fine, that's why I tell them in the first place.
What really fucked me over were the two or three times a guy assured me that it wouldn't be a problem and that it didn't matter to him - only to bail out two weeks later... It just really sucks to get your hopes up that you've found someone really special... only to find out you were wrong."
16,"I don't know the circumstances of this of course, but it seems that her dying while being sheltered in another person's embrace (yours) is one of the most beautifully intimate ways to leave this world. I think many people, even me, hope our last moments are spent that way. I'm sure it was still painful for you, but I hope in your grief you allow yourself some measure of peace of mind in knowing you gave her comfort in her final moments. Here's to all those people like you who give of themselves every day to make the world better, one act of kindness at a time."
17,"Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it? Or just let it slip?"
18,My famous (not really) meatballs
19,"I like you're question to paragraph efficiency. Very impressive.

I do have to duck through a standard doorway as my forehead is smack level with the top of door jams in standard doorways. If I'm in a boxy type house, I often walk around a bit hunched, so I always need to check my posture.

I DO have to keep an eye out for head hitting, but you'll be amazed the 6th sense I've developed for anything at head height... especially when walking backwards, or not paying attention. I've matrix style ducked my way out of some potentially hazardous situations... and other times I have not!

Our shower head is a bit over 6 foot, so I do need to duck to wash my hair... But it extends up a fair way so it's not too bad.

My wife is 5'5"" of awesomeness."
20,"We don't act like single people looking for a partner, picking someone is a two person job. Vetos are instantly respected and not questioned but we work through the why so we learn more about what we are okay and not okay with. We're both private people who need to have alot of trust in someone to let them near us physically. So we've ended up forging pretty tight friendships. No one and done's really. We're not really into anyone poly or emotionally available. Mostly the people who have interested us are similar to us. Professional, straight laced but with the one wild card, people that no one would guess would be down.

Since we end up being friends, the emotional boundries run along those lines. Lots of texting, talking and honesty no one hides anything. He always puts me first."
21,"i tend to have long relationships! also i try to be very faithful.

only women satisfy my urges, tbh"
22,Bright orange lol.
23,"Depends... If it's below my knees, I'm letting it slip"
24,"My butt works just fine, thanks for asking 😂"
25,"Welcome to Reddit!

What’s your best recipe?"
26,"I was anxious, scared, worried. We had a pretty loud alarm clock and would awaken at the same time but she wouldn't wake. No movement at all. No signs of breathing. Nothing."
27,Take her ass to civil court. Ruin her financially. That’s the only way to make her pay for what she did.
28,"Being with good friends (not family though, they're scum), talking to people about it, working, active, etc. I did cry a lot after she had died. I have a personalized key chain with a picture of us on our wedding day."
29,"Naw, it’s not weird. It’s a trauma response."
30,"I was a late adderal bloomer, didn't receive A. D. D diagnoses until I was in my late 30's. The pay doc inquired about the type of job I had, which required a extensive amount of administrative oversight on a staff in which detailed reports and numerous deadlines were a majority of my workload. He bluntly stated worst type of job to be in with my condition, so was prescribed adderal and wow what a difference it made, kinda of felt like Neo at the end of first matrix movie, everything seemed so clear. Took adderal for about 15 years, once retired no longer taking it, I am convinced it really allowed me to function at a productive level, now retired don't miss or need it anymore."
31,Spending time with family without all of them being on a iPhone or android or computer
32,When she offered to give me blowjob after I got out I told her we needed to record the whole thing... she says “ what you think I’d call the cops on you”? Uhhh yeah bitch.
33,CUNT
34,sexuality issues in general. symptoms of borderline began showing. some intense trauma and anger. i was a problem child and so i started sharing my sexual thoughts with my shrink
35,Any creepy pms yet?
36,"""Anything larger than a figer will cause significant tearing and bleeding.""

Well then, for once I'd be perfectly equipped for the situation."
37,I’m getting the same question a lot. No nothing happened to her. She gets to live her life like nothing happened.
38,What are the rules and boundaries you two have set up for each other?
39,"I suppose it's better than not having sex at all, but I personally don't enjoy the sensation much. Might be an important ""replacement"" for a guy though."
40,"hahah I can't really pin-point where 'my' accent is from. I've heard someone mention ""london-proper"" which I kind of took it and ran with it. At that point I had already told everyone I was from Nottingham (because I liked the Robin Hood tale), but the accent is definitely not northern. Idk! As far as learning and practicing go, I actually did it kind of on a whim once with my cousin on a family vacation one summer. We spoke like that all week long. I just happened to be fairly good at it. I've always kind of been a bit of an entertainer, so I do a lot of different accents when I'm making jokes or telling stories. My 'valley girl' and old boston woman are probably my best. hah"
41,DO NOT TELL ANYONE.
42,Only for baking recipes for my sweet grandchildren!
43,I’m game
44,I would love to but I can’t afford a lawyer.
45,"You can at least take her to small claims, and make sure it’s on court record that she lied and falsely accused you. 

You don’t need a lawyer for that. Also, try posting in r/legaladvice the first thing they’ll tell you is to not communicate with her."
46,what regional english accent? how did you learn and practice the nuances?
47,"I respect that man, best of luck to you"
48,Have you ever baked a pie?
49,"Well, its either that, or a pencil dick."
50,"Ah, that’s a lot less I would expect from a nympho. Can women satisfy your urges too?"
51,210cm
52,welp. i did some quick maths and it's around 14
53,Can you tell your height in meters?
54,Saying that meeting a guy with a micro penis would be delightful on Reddit openly is like ringing the creepy PM dinner bell but instead of a bell it's that air horn the fire department uses so I'm sorry for what you are about to go through
55,Are u Australian
56,What about... ^^^hand ^^^holding?
57,"(sex related, i'm assuming.)

sex slings ahaha definitely. i wanna get more into ""rich"" bdsm but in this economy ya gotta be a mcgyver"
58,What about butt sex?
59,not their fault. definitely shakira's fault.
60,Lol. Why would you think I’m the dominant one? Quite the opposite.
61,Hello are you my wife? Since when are you on reddit?
62,What incident led to you being brought to a medical or mental health professional to receive your diagnosis?
63,What words of wisdom do you think are important to take to heart?
64,"Thank you. To be completely honest with you – and I still don't know if this is normal or not – because I was so young, it was almost easy to recover from. My grandparents took me in, and they got me therapy (which I don't really remember clearly). They were also incredibly good at distracting me. Of course I was old enough to know what had happened, and to know my parents and brother were never coming back, but the huge life changes (moving to my grandparents ranch, which had always been my favorite place on earth even before the accident, moving to a new school, getting a new puppy to help with comforting me, etc.) were all very exciting. I remember having random breakdowns all the time and crying hysterically basically 24/7 for like the first year after it happened, but like I said, I was very easily distracted. The older I got and the longer life went on without my parents and brother, the more memories of them were replaced by new ones of my grandparents and my new life. Then by the time I was about 9 or 10, I had more clear memories of my grandparents than I did of my parents and brother. 

Maybe I sound like an emotionless weirdo, I don't know."
65,I know this may be kinda sensitive but what was ur reaction when u woke next to her and she wouldn’t wake?
66,"Lol I don’t think I’m your wife. But if I am, hi hubby, love you."
67,Correct.
68,Will your accuser be facing any repercussions?
69,"they fuck me. i obviously wouldn't choose a sexual partner without telling them in advance that i REQUIRE lots of sex and also lots of care for my body because i'll ask for pretty dangerous things.

but i'm in a ltr right now and everything is fine!"
70,Thank you I really do appreciate your kind words
71,having loads of sex OR going on antidepressants to stabilize it
72,"oh my GOD DON'T SAY IT


okay this post is closed forever. please arrest this person, they're commenting nasty stuff on my post!!!!"
73,How many men have you had bail after you told them about your condition?
74,"Takes a strong man to be able to look back that. Best of luck OP, you have my respect."
75,Lol explains trump

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated."
77,"My boyfriend is 6'4, I cant imagine him having 7 more inches added in height. Do you have to bend down through door ways and constantly watch out for things as to not smack your head?

Do you have a crazy tall shower head or do you have to bend over some in order to wash your hair? How tall/short is your wife?"
78,"Sorry for your loss, how have you been dealing with it?"
79,"That's not going to help you, really. It can be looked at as manipulation. And you're only going to alienate someone you otherwise might be able to connect with.

Maybe just don't have sex right away with people if you want to be cautious. I understand your trust issues completely, I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in."
80,How many partners have you had?
81,It can be both.
82,"What's something that you miss bedire the internet was big.


(Commonly asked, my uncreative self)"
83,"Saskatoon and apple yes, more of a crisp girl personally."
84,Bigger than your future :)
85,"(I'm English) recently my brother went to the us and someone said ""I love your accent, what are you, Australian"" so I don't think Nottingham Vs London would be noticed!"
86,You only knew him once?
87,"Naturally the first time is always a little awkward, but yes, instant connection to the extreme. I knew right then and there he was someone special."
88,Fuck
89,"I have a hard time this. I get where you’re coming from, but being on the opposite end where I was assaulted, robbed and raped for years and he got away with it, I’m hoping I wouldn’t hate all men because of it.

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD and Major depressive disorder, but it won’t further my cause to hate, and please don’t record your dates. If you’re that full of fear you’re not ready. 

I’m sorry for what you went through, but if it’s causing you to hate, you’re not doing yourself any favours in the future."
90,"hey thank you for saying that! i do try my best.
i've been unfaithful in the past (granted, relationship status at that moment was ""complicated"", but i view it as unfaithfulness nonetheless) and i felt terrible. cheating doesn't sit well with me! also masturbation fulfills me pretty much 100%; if i feel like seeking another person it's usually the other aspects of a sexual encounter that i lack such as attention or acceptance."
91,"Thanks for asking! I feel somewhere between okay and pretty good. The first 2-4 days were not okay. I felt exhausted and struggled to stay awake. I had an overwhelming feeling of sadness. I didn't want to do much of anything. That has since subsided thankfully, but I still have this mild sense that something is missing or not right - a small void I guess."
92,"Yeah I did, pretty often. I work at a coffee shop near an airport, and it's pretty often that I come into contact with someone from the UK. We usually chat about this and that in the UK -- I've done a fair bit of research, and I think well on my feet (a positive that's come from such a negative trait), so I usually can carry a conversation pretty well about it all."
93,"'Love' is green and 'Hate' is brown. And in case you were wondering, ampersands are red haha."
94,"You may want to join r/baking

r/oldschoolcool might also be a good one. It’s a community for sharing old photos people think are awesome, and people there LOVE it when grandparents add context to things.l

Welcome aboard, Nana."
95,I didn’t want to take her up on the offer. I said that because I knew I was going to screnshot the conversation and I wanted to show how fucked up she is.
96,He is not my husband lol
97,"Met my wife on an elevator on a cruise ship. I said, “ Do you want to go back to your cabin alone, or come to my cabin and have crazy monkey sex?” 

14 years and two kids strong!"
98,"Above the elbows, surprisingly mild for June"
99,Orangey yellow.
100,She said she was mad at me because her friend was saying some fucked up things about me.
101, Nope. I even called the cop up later who arrested me and he said “that’s the criminal justice system for you if you don’t like it become a lawyer. “
102,"That is a weird coincidence. 

My husband is in the military, so yes, we are apart often. He is deployed to the Middle East right now, so I haven’t seen him in a few months."
103,Do you think you’ll keep using it?
104,"Okay that will be quite hard. Cause both sides of the media are highly biased. you gotta read everything with a grain of salt. Warzone wise, liveuamap has a great website and app that is regularly updated to check out which side is where. In Syria we saw a rise of local Facebook news pages that are independent and report things on the ground that had a lot of people trust. They post in Arabic though... 
You could ask me over here if you want to know anything and I'll try my best explaining.  😁"
105,"Yeah, I do. Almost everything I own clothing wise is tailored - thank God for thailand in that respect!
Otherwise it's very generic  tees and hoodies."
106,"u/itsjoetho, you are NOT the husband."
107,"Word of caution,  Watch your weight,  when I dropped off cold turkey I gained 100 lbs.   I miss the clarity, but I am less of an asshole,  usually."
108,"Very much so.
Actually, it's a regular thing for us that if she can't find something, she needs to 'think tall', because I often just put things on a top shelf, or on the fridge because it's convenient for me."
109,"hey i like this question a lot.

the line is drawn where i wake up in the morning feeling disgusted with myself because of choices i made without proper thinking. and i also happen to like sex a lot, i like talking about it and especially educating youth about the least known risks of sexual behavior and how to overcome that.

again, it was not a sudden diagnosis. i had plenty of therapy sessions before even considering it as a problem. when my therapist started noticing a couple patterns here and there she warned me about it and educated me a bit.

im always trying to be up to date on all things sexy so i can know what to expect from healthy sexual behavior, as well as try to cut down on certain thoughts and obsessions.

the hardest part is definitely accepting that some fantasies are bound to never make it to the real world, and also accepting that it's for the best!

i hope this answer was good enough."
110,Did you ever run into an actual English person with an authentic accent?
111,How could anyone read this and think it's a legitimate question and not a joke?
112,The air is clearer. And I can see for miles.
113,"I like to joke that I was built not bought. I know he is hopeless in love with me and I could pull the plug on everything if I needed to, so with the trust there it's hot instead of stressful. Plus after care is critical.

As odd as it sounds. I think anything that skirts the edge of non monogamy needs to be intensely rooted in traditional values and loyalty - your my person until death, my family no matter what ect.  If you want it to last."
114,Thanks man/woman. :)
115,"Thanks, and I don't mind you asking. We met 11 years ago at a care home there on my first day there as a full time kitchen assistant. She worked as a carer there. We didn't start a relationship until 2 years later."
116,"Katie = Light blue      
Breeona = Blue with some dark red     
Brian = Blue with hints of a lighter blue    
Brittany = Blue with some hints of brown    
Addison = A slightly dark red, but not as dark as the letter 'E.'   

It's not too much :D"
117,She sounds like a sociopath. Sorry that happened to you.
118,"+ the people have realized that it was never Gov vs rebels and that it’s a much bigger game than that..
Its US vs Russia... the gulf trying to control the middle east... turkey fueling the war with more weapons...  and so on.. 
the only loser in this war is us, the people."
119,"My family are excited! Katie, breeona, brian, baylee, brittany, and Addison. Sorry for a lot but this is super"
120,It provided me with the exact same capabilities in a similar job. Glad you're doing well and hope you enjoy retirement.
121,"I did try to commit suicide a couple times over the next few months, but my friends helped me through it all."
122,"It's jsut, me and my wife also met online, first day she visited we had sex. That's about 4 years ago, we got married last fall.

OK but to stay on topic, have you guys had a big distance between you?"
123,She is. After I got out she told me she was raped. This may sound horrible but I felt karma is a bitch.
124,Have you tried it? Is this a good compromise?
125,"absolutely!! when i turned 18 i even wrote a letter to my fav pornstar asking her to guide me thru it

but then i gave up on it. i might do something abt it sometime but idk"
126,i have narcissistic tendencies so whenever i can talk about myself without doing any social harm i try and do so!
127,"Haha i was expecting this question - i guess its all subjective but yes, I'm in proportion and past reports have been favourable... I think a lot of girls see the height as a novelty though more than any other sizeable factors.

The days of using height as a pick up line are behind me though; very happily and gratefully married to an awesome woman."
128,"Maybe you just being there was all she really needed.

I was in a horrific accident several years ago. My husband lost his life on impact. I woke up on the ground with someone I couldn’t see holding my head still. I was disoriented and afraid. I kept saying “I’m afraid. I’m afraid.”  The person holding my head told me “It’s going to be alright. Everything will be alright. “ That is what I needed to hear to be able to get through that moment. I was able to calm down and let the first responders do their job.  

While I was in the hospital, she came to see me. She was feeling guilty that she thought she had lied to me. She was the first person on the scene because she lived nearby and heard the crash. She knew as soon as she got there that my husband had died. 

I think I responded reassuringly, but not very coherently. My friend who was in my room gave her a hug and let her know it was okay. I didn’t see her again. 

But I’ve thought about her many times and have often wanted to let her know that she did the best thing she could have for what I needed in that moment. 

Maybe your presence was what the lady needed the most."
129,My grandson is proud of you reddit
130,My family believed me. They couldn’t visit me in jail they do a video chat thing but we just talked on the phone.
131,"Kasidie.com mainly. Fair warning, do not rush it. We met two amazing couple's, with similar amounts to lose in the way of professional jobs and straight laced lifestyles. Not everyone is looking for the same thing so take your time. Oh! And be prepared to dodge alot of old people."
132,What kind of advice would you offer to someone that suffers from compulsive lying?
133,You don't even deserve to start the petition by spelling his first and last name wrong.
134,I'm about 190 cm and sometimes have some problems with choosing of clothes. Do you have such problems?
135,"Yes, they're especially more vibrant with reading. When I see the colors spoken they usually come with the word 'written' as well. I typically don't like red words, like your username because they pop out so much and sometimes jump scare me haha."
136,Why do you think she accused you in the first place? Do you think she felt guilty you were in jail?
137,I’m 4’8 and god I just really want us to take a pic together lol
138,"Actually really well...  I had told him a week or two prior to the confession that I no longer wanted to be in a relationship (as I had a lot of stuff to figure out, clearly). I said to him, ""When you get this chance this week, I'd like to sit down with you and talk."" And one thing led to another, and it all came out. He proposed to me, which in hind-sight was probably the least healthy reaction he could have had. I did go through with breaking up with him, eventually, because it was clear we were in a really unhealthy cycle, and doing each other very little good. But yeah -- I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't a proposal. His reasons for proposing were that he would never meet anyone as 'honest' as I was being just then. He snapped out of that feeling a few days later, when I think it started to dawn on him the implications that he couldn't believe anything I said at any point through the last 5 1/2 years, and that he probably didn't know me as well as he thought he did. It is something I will always deeply regret, but I can only now use that shame to ensure I never lie/abuse people's trust like that, again."
139,"If I wanted to know more, about the war, about Syria, other than hoping for opportunities like this, where can I learn more? Should I just start on Wikipedia and hope for the best? 😬"
140,"Same reason why consent contracts don't hold up in court.  Same reason you can rape a spouse.  Consent can always be retracted.  Not only that, but the women can claim that the action of him video taping them caused them to feel threatened and coerced.  ""What's going to happen if I refuse?""  That'd be a great line the woman's lawyer could get from her in any actual trial (should this person experience a repeat in this outlier behavior and it goes to court).

Plus the video is only a snapshot in time.  Just like with consent contracts, they're a snapshot of a moment that doesn't capture the events afterwards.  Sure, she could have been genuine then, but then follow on actions after said filming caused her to change her mind.  So a random person (not OP) couldn't do this same thing, getting a woman to say she had a good time on film, and then make a sexually aggressive move on the woman without her consent.  ""yes, I did say that at the time.  However, that was before he assaulted me, which I did not consent to.""

So basically it wouldn't hold up at all.  It's only something that OP is doing because it provides some comfort to his trauma.  However, it's not legally binding and is likely turning away any potential female companionship because it ends the night on a bit of a strange (and to be 100% honest, a little unnerving) note."
141,How was the first time? Was there an instant connection?
142,"I had a really really bad childhood growing up and have had depression for as long as I can remember. The first time I self harmed was like the 6th grade and things just went down hill from there, fast. I think after spending so long in certain state of mind it’s really hard to break out of it, even after your surroundings and the quality of your life has changed. I’m really really trying to break out of it, but sometimes it ends up getting the best of me. I also have BPD so sometimes even minor set backs seem like the lowest of lows to me. And my boyfriend is the only person I’ve told in the last several years so I guess it’s not fully a secret. I used to tell him every time I felt suicidal but I know it hurts him so much and he wants nothing more than for me to be happy so lately I’ve just been trying to deal with things on my own to ease his mind"
143,During my early teens when I found myself unable to use tampons and went to see a gynecologist about it :)
144,"I have a hall pass. But I actually think there is something about the feeling of ""lending"" him to this friend that does something for me. Some of the power behind it. The dirty talk and after care when he gets back. Even the fact that not a single person in our life would guess. The fact it's brought back alot of the hyper communication you fall out of in a long term relationship. If him playing with someone didn't give me something I think the fact I don't currently have a playmate or Fwb would make it not fun. A kink? Idk"
145,"I had met someone from Devon, I think, a few months ago, who said I didn't sound like I was from Nottingham. I just kind of chuckled, embarrassed, and said I've been living in the US for years. They didn't push it, but I'm sure they were rolling their eyes on the way out!"
146,That conservation’s abrupt ending means....
147,I knew a tall guy once . He was from Down the Under.  All 6ft2 of him
148,"Sex can still be great without the penetration part. Just grinding it out until everyone cums can be better then penetration. 

I would work with what you got.  Many women don’t get off on the penetration part of sex anyways. 

Are you assertive in bed?  At 24, I doubt it (no offence intended), but maybe you should try and become a “top” who  has more say in what kinds of sex happens."
149,"I hit this height around 23 or 24... I'm 30 now.
I don't know how tall I was at 5 but I do know between year 9 and 10 (in the holidays), I left school 3rd or 4th tallest, and came back tallest by a good inch or so... I was 6'6"" at 16.... that I do remember.

It's the head hitting that builds that sense!"
150,How do you get diagnosed with nymphomania? where and how do you draw the line between liking sex a lot and having a problem?
151,"Well since then I've been working as a Bartender. I like to cycle, walk, swim, hang out with friends."
152,I love Toblerone Chocolate. I buy one every week. Anyone who doesn't like Toblerone is not human in my opinion. :D
153,"^This. Also a survivor of years of rape. I hate my rapist, he’ll never get any punishment, but at least I came out stronger to spite him. That’s only justice I’ll get. But I honestly hate people who make false rape claims just as much as rapists. They’re a huge reason why real survivors of sexual trauma are ignored and my blood boils just thinking how their manipulations ruin countless Iives. They ruin the life of the innocent people they accuse and they ruin the lives of every rape survivor who isn’t believed. 

So sorry this happened to you OP. If you’re still so mistrusting of women I’d say lay off dating for a while so you have the time you need to heal. And when you’re ready to date again take it slow. Be friends with the girl first and build a strong level of trust and respect between the two of you before you start a sexual relationship. That way you know the quality of person you’re with and that you won’t have to worry about being accused again."
154,My husband and I have an open relationship.  Different situation than yours but it works for us. I hope you find that fwb soon.
155,How do your sexual partners cope with it?
156,"Do you have any health issues that are a result from your height?

My boyfriend is one of you tall folk at 7 foot and in the past year he had 2 reconstructive foot surgeries, problems for him came from him growing too fast and the bone structures not forming properly."
157,Awesome. Seems like while you really enjoy what you are doing it you are doing it in a constructive manner. Being faithful is important and understanding your urges and how to control them in case that bug hits you to stray.
158,"unprotected sex, sex under influence, orgies, sex with strangers, things like that."
159,Is it possible to learn this power?
160,"Thank you! It's CreepsMcPasta, my sister actually watches his videos daily and listened to my story without knowing it was mine at first!"
161,"I wouldn’t believe it happened. She lied about you, she will lie about this."
162,Does this work for words/names in languages you might not know? Very curious. Thank you.
163,Which is the best way of dealing with it?
164,"I was *actually* raped. Lack of evidence, nothing happened to him. 

A woman *accused* you of rape. Lack of evidence, you spend 7 months in prison.

Makes me sad that a rapist can get off scot free and accusers put innocent people like yourself in jail. I’m so sorry this happened to you."
165,"Hi there, thanks for your reply. I agree with you, penetration isn't everything, and I should really work with what I've got. After all I've had sexual encounters with women that were pretty satisfying sexually. (You are right though, I wouldn't say I'm particularly assertive, probably due to my relative inexperience) 

I guess the thing that worries me the most is not penetration itself, but all of the stuff attached to it... I have thoughts like: ""no guy in their right mind would willingly refrain from penetrative sex"", ""I will never have a boyfriend"", ""I will never marry"", ""I will never give birth"", ""What if someone tries to rape me"" ... I realize that maybe I am dramatizing things, but I feel like this condition affects much more than just my sexuality... it's kind of affecting most parts of my life to be honest."
166,"Oh, the asshole factor. That was an issue for me as well. I could see someone was trying to engage in conversation with me but would totally blow them off due to having something else on my mind. 

Thanks for the advice!"
167,"I think we do too! It could have gone very differently. 

Basically we met on an app. He was stationed overseas at the time and we chatted for a few months. When he moved back to the States, he flew to visit me. I think his only ‘power’ is that he was very open and honest with me, and we were friends first texting and talking on the phone every day. Being intimate with him the first day I ever physically met him didn’t feel weird at all. It felt natural."
168,That’s exactly what I said to her.
169,"Does it give you a sense of ownership that no matter what, he always returns to you?"
170,How did that go over in the beginning? Did anyone in your family of friend group question the accent when it first popped up?
171,"Did you get any sort of compensation for spending 7 months in jail on a false charge?

And it’s really unfortunate that this had to happended to you."
172,"And as for my family, they always saw me as a 'story teller' ever since I was a little girl. I used to spin pretty wild tales, either for entertainment or to lie, but I think they just rolled their eyes, and kept quiet about it, figuring it was probably just a phase."
173,Why do you still secretly think of suicide? Does your bf know about your desire to kill yourself? Have you talked to him about it?
174,"Syrian dish? Definitely 🍒 Cherry and Meatballs. (It's a local dish from Aleppo.) Or Mloukhieh.
Fast food: Shawerma or some fried chicken with a Syrian garlic cream..."
175,"Hi thanks for your reply. Unfortunately I don't know any name for this condition. As another person suggested, your friend should probably look up vaginismus (basically it's an uncontrollable muscle spasm in your pelvic floor) - it's one of the most common causes of painful sex. Although the bleeding you've described makes me think your friend might suffer from something else apart from vaginismus. 
I personally don't have vaginismus though, my problem is an anatomical abnormality - so I'm in no way an expert. But I agree with you, it can be excruciatingly difficult to find a solution for these kinds of problems."
176,Totally and how he returns is part of the fun.
177,Love &amp; Hate?
178,That is weird. Probably some pedo fetish. Ya I’d just ignore that one.
179,"I had a friend back in high school who was faking a British accent as well. We never got to confront her about it, but once we ran into her very American sounding parents, all the pieces fell into place. We started to notice that her accent was always off and really just made us awkward to be around her."
180,You don't have to have sex with someone for them to file a false accusation against you.
181,"Thanks. Yeah, she was very special to me. Creepily enough, a couple nights before she died, I had a dream in which she was dead and I was just laying my face on her stomach crying my eyes out. :(

I tried killing myself twice after she passed. One night I gave myself alcohol poisoning by drinking lots of Vodka and one night I tried hanging myself."
182,Will you answer?
183,"At some point a male playmate is probably in the cards for me but I have some hangups so it would need to be someone I really trust so we've gone a different route for me. Thanks, me too. I've had alot of bait and switch, which makes me laugh. It's worked wonders for my husband's confidence lol. My unwillingness to full swap with a guy rules out alot of potential partners."
184,"I saw a video of a horrific drunk driving crash in Temecula California (maybe you've seen it, it was pretty viral) and it shook me up more than it would the average person. It's been two days and I can't quit thinking about it. So, I thought I'd post this, because oddly enough, talking about our crash helps me feel better (it has to do with not being alone in my head with my thoughts or something)"
185,"Is it a name for it? My friend have a similar problem but have never got any help with it, the doctors here (sweden) aren’t really taking it serious and doesn’t do anything to investigate in it. She can have sex sometimes though but almost every time she bleeds a lot and can’t understand why :/"
186,thats what i did. *does cross sign with hands*
187,"Hmm... I think sit with yourself quietly for awhile. Ask yourself why you lie, and answer honestly. Figure out if it's for survival, or because you hate yourself, or that you wish you were someone else, or that you try to escape you're real life -- or all of the above. From that point, I think it's up to you what you do with that information. For me, it came with understanding that I was hurting myself, first, then the awareness that I'm now allowing people the chance to get to know me... THEN realizing I'm robbing people of the chance to make their own opinion of me. All around, there's very little good that can come from lying. Eventually, I think, if you give yourself the chance, you will realize that hating yourself is wasted energy and wasted time. And robbing yourself of the opportunity to be liked and loved for who you truly are is just one of the saddest things I can think of."
188,What is one thing on your bucket list?
189,"I shut them out.

I hated the pity party. They couldn't look at me without crying, or talk to me the same way they used to. People who never talked to me was suddenly my best friend, school nominated me homecoming princess despite never being popular. A lot of kids might appreciate this, but I just turned into a b*tch tbh. I hated all of it, I just wanted everything to be the exact same, just without me having hair."
190,ye
191,How do you go about finding new people?
192,Amen
193,It's a joke I think
194,"well, technically it has had some negative impact on my life. earlier on, i mean.

i've learnt to control it, sort of. or at least manage it better than i used to.

i believe it's called hypersexuality nowadays also"
195,"People generally tend to assume it's the parents' fault somehow, when a kid ends up like this."
196,Dude you're an idiot for wanting to take that offer up. She fucked your life up and then will be laughing about it to her friends you're fine after the rapey bj.
197,So basically you can't even think straight?
198,"Hey OP!

Fellow FF here. It's great to talk about these things with people, personally i find strangers much easier to talk to then people I know.

I'm not sure how your feeling or if you have experienced this before. But it's perfectly Normal to feel uneasy/rattled/upset by these experiences. We all go through it to some degree or another. 

Maybe you will experience a decrease in appetite or disruption to your sleep patterns and that's ok. But if it continues for more then a week you should seek someone at a more professional level to talk to. 

We dont want another FF to become affected by PTSD"
199,"I'm in exactly the same situation. My wife was getting raises more than my annual income, so I became a stay-at-home dad. I love it!"
200,"What about your family? Did they visit you in jail and believe your innocence? How has your relationship with them changed, if at all?"
201,"I try I try. Thanks for answering my questions! 
I do have one or two more for you lol. At what age did you reach the height you are now? 
Do you know how tall you were at, let's say, age 5? 

I wish my boyfriend had your sixth sense, he rams into everything full speed then gets angry that things arent much higher, as if the majority of the people we're around are as tall as he is."
202,i see you're a man of culture as well
203,You have a g spot in your ass she doesn't
204,nope. i hope i never break this fourth wall
205,"im a solid 8. could lose some pounds. could get breast reduction. could be less lazy. could get a decent haircut. could get more hours of sleep. 

#but whatever"
206,You need to cut communication with her and take this to the press or lawyer. At this point you can be charged with harassment or something stupid. Hell even small claims is free if you're poor and not many know that because my friend just did it to someone.
207,"Roomed right next to a 6’11” guy in college. He was very popular with the ladies for a well storied “large” reason.

I asked him about it once and he said that all of his tall friends (he also played basketball and went to camps so I imagine that means he met quite a few tall guys) it was a common asset and just assumed it was because he was tall.

So...you know what I’m asking. Just generally curious."
208,Only on Mondays
209,Her hips were deceptive after all. I knew it!
210,"I took adderall (and other ADHD meds) for most of my life. When I turned 17 I told my parents I didn’t want to take it anymore and they supported my decision. So for 5 years I tried to live life normally with out any meds or therapy. I ended up becoming a C-D student on academic probation, I gained up to 40 pounds and was fairly inactive, and struggled with sleep. My parents threatened to kick me out multiple times because I honestly didn’t know what I was doing and was motivated to do anything.

I heard a quote while researching ADHD coping methods about medication. “Your ADHD meds are like glasses. You can live without them but life is just gonna be a bit blurry.” It made me realize that I am who I am and I gotta just embrace it. The ADHD is not going away. So I decided to contact a psychiatrist and got reassessed and began a new prescription and therapy sessions. It’s been two years and I’ve never been better. I lost 40 pounds and began working out twice a week, I raised my grades up to A’s becoming an honors student, and most importantly I’m more confident in myself and parents have never been prouder. 

Taking a break from adderall can be good. Let’s you figure out what works and doesn’t work. For some people staying off adderall is the best choice. I hope you enjoy your break off adderall."
