0,"Well when I was about 13, so he woulda been about 8/9, he tried to kill me on thanksgiving:
I tended to take a book outside into the back of my grandmas garden to read before the big family dinner. My little bro came out with a a shotgun(later found out it was my grandfathers that he kept in his closet).  He just walked right up to me smiling aiming the gun at me. 
Being kind of used to this behavior I stayed pretty calm and tried talking him down.... after about a 5 minute conversation we decided it wouldn’t be in his interest to kill me today because that meant that they would likely cancel the dinner and he wouldn’t get any of the chocolate cake our great aunt makes once a year."
1,I love you. Carry on.
2,"Because our hair is so thick and coarse, it can be a hassle to style. This state, “being natural” has resulted in me taking nearly 5 hours to do a style on my hair that lasts for 4 days. It’s easier to get a style of braids done in 5 hours that lasts for 4 months instead of 4 days. Other times, when a persons hair is damaged, they tend to get weaves  (protective styles without heat) to let the hair get back to a healthy state. 

I am in LOVE with green apples, mozzarella sticks, rotel, and celery."
3,"A. I’m a believer in economic “boycotting” and protesting. Black Lives Matter uses riots AND peaceful protests to express anger and resentment towards black people. I however, don’t believe they are actually making a change, but just getting the information out there. They’re in a way, just advertising. If you were to ask me who’s methods were better, I’d choose Malcolm X over Martin Luther King Jr. The protests are beautiful and symbolic, but take too long and can end BADLY. BLM just became a battleground for people sick of mistreatment, instead of a method of resolving it. 

B. History makes being white a crime. The actions of people who happened to be white placed a stereotype upon whites that makes them unable to express real struggle due to other races struggles caused by PEOPLE WHO HAPPENED TO BE WHITE. No one asks to be born black, white, mexican, asian, or indian. None of these races intentionally breed the next murderers, racists, and terrorists. But the ignorance and fear of other races because of their history, makes them hate whites in order to push them into an inferior state. It’s okay to be white, but once you express any struggle
the world hates you. I believe that is true in today’s world, but I don’t support it. Everyone should be able to live in a world with no issue, but then it wouldn’t be the world if there were no issue."
4,"I spent a month in a small town in South America last year and the question of “Can I touch your hair” and “Is it real” were so fascinating and I loved it. The people were genuinely interested in me and my hair type. I do, however feel offended when people touch my hair without asking. Asking questions about our hair gives you a better insight on our culture, which in my opinion is never something to be offended about."
5,Thank you for your service
6,"We were in a relationship for almost year and a half, and about 5-6 months from the start of the relationship she began to abuse me verbally, but also there were more than a few times of physical abuse, and it all went like boiling frog, I didn't even realise that it wasn't normal anymore. She used to humiliate me, to make me feel guilty for everything that happened, I was even guilty for being more successful in college than her."
7,How do I get comment karma? There’s so many posts I want to comment on but it tells me I don’t have enough comment karma
8,Why do so many black people wear weaves? What is your favorite food?
9,"I give you nuggets and you ask me for more, such is the bane of the nugget god"
10,"ayee same here, I don't work at the biggest theater but having 22 showings each selling 100+ tickets is pretty brutal"
11,Forgot to add that we do have one giant group chat once a month that about 20ish of us get on. We’ve all formed bonds with those we have the most in common with though. We range from 14-25 so there’s a good age gap.
12,"He recently moved in with my grandparents after trying to get my parents thrown in a jail,and got a job at home depot.... this happened after he screwed up a job working at a resort by never showing up to be taken to the ski lodge he was being transferred to..... the reasoning he wasn’t showing up we found out was because he met this 28yearold mom online and within a month had done this:


Lied and said he was 29(he was 17 with no license)...
Convinced her to have his baby...
Said his previous gf stole his credit card and ID, which is why he had no money...
Got her to leave her kids with him while she went out of town for work...
And got her to give him he car....


My parents found out and after giving him a chance to tell the girl the truth, they ended up telling her. That led to him trying to get my parents thrown in jail...

So he’s a huge dick that is able to function as long as he can trick someone into taking care of him."
13,"I have no idea if it was or not, he walked away with it, and we never spoke of it again.....on a lighter note; a couple thanksgivings later I got to shoot him with his airsoft gun, him and my cousin had been  given them as presents, and it was pretty satisfying."
14,Wow. To be calm when someone is holding a gun at you takes a lotta balls!! Was it loaded?
15,I was in a vulnerable position and encountered a “man” who manipulated me through various means over a few weeks and then told me that I was indebted to him. I didn’t know at the time but he was handling a few different girls. Through the use of threats/abuse/psychological means I ended up in a situation where I was unable to escape. I was in my early 30s when it started and it went on for about 6 months. I got out thankfully by being able to access the healthcare system when I got pregnant. Some very amazing doctors/nurses/social workers got me the help I needed. I am safe now and have a beautiful daughter as a result. She’s amazing.
16,Been where you are before. I didn't even realize how much I hated it until I was fired. Best thing that ever happened to me.
17,Thank you!
18,Dude it’s not fun at all. The sad part is the initial big wave of Avengers will last another month
19,"I mean clearly not amazing but I’m dealing with it pretty well for my case. Just got diagnosed with C-PTSD (also from other shit) and gonna go in therapy real soon. Thank you for asking btw, that’s really sweet :)"
20,What happened
21,"WOW! I have never heard of this! OH MY GOD I HAVE THIS!!, I didn’t know this was a thing!! If there’s a spectrum of this, I have it only a bit, in that — for example, there’s no way I could even sketch for you what my mom’s face looks like. I have no idea. But I recognize her by context more than anything. HOLY CRAP! I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS IS A THING!!!"
22,That’s fucked up. How’re you doing?
23,"My friends husband has this! They have a ‘signal’ when they’re out in public together that if he doesn’t introduce her, she introduces herself with a “hi I’m ____” which makes the other person respond with their name so he can figure out who it is. If she already knows them she will greet them by name and obviously if he recognises them by other means such as gait or clothing then it’s not necessary. 

Have you ever thought of using a system with friends or family to help you out?"
24,I’m doing fairly well considering. I’ve got some obvious mental health issues and issues that predated this but I graduated last year from a socially-funded year-long residential program where I was able to connect with other survivors and do some healing.
25,Thank You for your service.
26,Do you get offended if someone asks if your hair is real?
27,"So the way I understand it a lot of subreddits have their own limits for comment karma. People have to upvote your previous comments in a thread for you to get that comment karma it's based on a balance system where one upvote = 1 good karma and one downvote = 1 bad karma/subtracts 1 good karma. So in my best efforts to help you with your comment karma, I have liked your comment fren"
28,"Honestly not really after awhile you kind of get used to it, it is a dirty job but I'm paid well."
29,I'm paid $18 an hour to basically drive around and do five minutes of work every 10 to 20 minutes or so
30,How are you doing
31,"As a black man. I'm not angry with your statements nor do they warrant anger, but I'm simply disappointed. There are elements of truth to your discourse but the way you express it is utterly unsatisfactory. It is so because the message you should be pushing is forget the past, as opposed to ""this happens because of that"". It's time for everyone to move on! That's the real message, if you really want equality then we must let go completely and not make these karma whoring statements where you ""side with a certain race"" to appear to support modern thought. We are all human, we are all different. We must give everyone a chance, the end."
32,Are you also the guy who lined up my 10 piece in rows? That made my day
33,Yes! I’m a manager so I watched it Wednesday night before showtimes went public on Thursday evening. Also saw it again over the weekend.
34,It's all part of my evil plan to bankrupt McDonalds
35,You're welcome
36,alright then. Gimme a crazy story from your teen years.
37,There was a special screening for the higher-up people. We tried to get a all-staff screening but Disney is super weird about that stuff with their movies. Managers were allowed to pre-watch it to verify that nothing was wrong with the film before we showed it to thousands of people.
38,have you actually ever talked to any of them?
39,"Short term  there was a toll. Definitely nights where it took time to go to sleep after talking to people in some real pain dealing with life being just totally shit. There were a few times I wanted to quit, and times it was hard to make myself go.  
   
But long term it was one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. Being able to help take away some of that pain just by talking - so easy and so valuable. Helping people live better lives. I don't know if I saved anyone's life, but I know I was helping. And it gave me some real perspective about the petty shit I let get me down every day.  


As for helping people deal with depression - the core tenet of the hotline where I worked was non-judgmental compassion. ""I'm sorry your dealing with that"" ""that must have felt incredibly crappy to have happen"" ""I think you're really strong just to have gone through that and still be talking to me"". Don't try to fix them, don't try to tell them what you think they should do (unless they specifically ask), and be appreciative of what they've accomplished no matter how small it may seem."
40,You need to make some calls and give Arthur a damn poncho.
41,We just end up throwing it away at the end of the night. Employees are free to take popcorn on their breaks and when they’re done with their shift but we usually just throw it away
42,"What are your thoughts on these two ideas:

""black lives matter""?

and ""it's okay to be white""?"
43,Is it as bad as it sounds?
44,"Of course. I used to feel this way more when I was younger, but my dad threw me into soccer where I was the only black person on my team for 7 years. Being invited to after game parties, movies, school events and such where I’m one of maybe 5 black people can be scary. Hell, it is now that I’m 17 compared to 6 years old. I see a security guard and freeze up. I’ll see a white ticket teller at the movie theatre and for a slight second question if I’ll be allowed to come in. (A certain area in town tends to not allow black kids in the stores)."
45,"you are the hero we need in America. under your selfless acts we can conquer all threats to our constitution both foreign and domestic

f for respec"
46,"Hey first of all. I want to apologise for the way I presented the message. You made good points and valid ones too, I chose to get ever so slightly offended (not entirely sure why but I've understood why now).

I can't add value to your point of view because I am sensing our realities of being blsck in this world are slightly different. I was born in Europe and have lived here my whole life. I don't fully understand the realities of growing up in a predominantly black neighbourhood. 

In a ideal world it would be optimal to adapt and move forward. I just finished an Master's in intercultural studies and interpreting, but I can assure you, your views, as a high school student, are very developed. Whether I fully agree or not it doesn't make a difference. Good luck in your future OP and thanks for your pov I foind it very enlightening."
47,"I’m a woman, but I’m not planning on having kids luckily. Does make me want a blood test before I sleep with anyone though lol"
48,"This guy is so insecure that he is jealous of a dream, and even worse, he allowed himself to become angry about it and tried to blame the whole thing on you. Do you consider this a 'red flag' for this relationship?"
49,"Yes actually, more frequently than I'd like to."
50,"I definitely LOVE seeing people integrating African culture in their hairstyles and food. I mean, we get sew ins and wigs that are from European culture, and it’s seen as beautiful."
51,That is something I can try
52,"It was a gradual process. I was seeing a therapist during college when I was 16. I suffered very bad social anxiety to the point it was interfering with my everyday life. I also was extremely lonely. She saw this and began breaking down boundaries with me. First it was subtle little things like texting me outside of therapy or buying me gifts. The relationship progressed further as she started getting me more expensive gifts, confessing how lonely she felt and how much she ""cared"" about me.

I was so vulnerable and in a bad place I fell in love with her. I never would have, but she encouraged an unhealthy power dynamic and unprofessional relationship. 

Eventually the touching started. It started off really innocent like her playing her hand on my shoulder or back when I walked in and out of her office. I noticed it when it started though. She then started putting her hand on my knee when I was upset. Eventually it evolved into hugs whenever we met and her asking me if I'd ever kissed somebody before.

At the time I was so confused with my feelings and emotions. She was in my head and I never would have gone through with it, but I did out of feeling she truly loved me. We kissed, we then started having sex and meeting up outside of therapy every couple of days.

She never loved me though. She was just using me because I was younger and would do whatever she wanted for her. It's no surprise that the moment the ""therapy"" with her ended so did our ""relationship"". Afterwards I was heart broken, but the more I think about it the more I realize I was groomed."
53,What do you guys do with leftover popcorn that doesn’t sell?
54,In social situations I typically just act like I forgot their name or recognize them eventually based on what they’re talking about or voice or whatever.
55,"Did it take a toll on you?
 And what's the best piece of advice you could offer someone wanting to help a friend suffering with depression?"
56,"When it started, it was like just comments that I wasn't good enough for her, that I do things wrong, but it just got worse and worse, it ended like I was guilty for everything bad that happens, she would yell at me if she didn't like her coffee at the coffee shop, everything I say, she would use against me, for example when I said few times that I had a headache she would tell me that I wasn't man enough for just saying that, when I get cold she would just tell me and people around me that I was so weak. When I got higher score than her in some tests at college, she made me feel guilty for that because I wasn't ""supporting"" her in studying much, so it was my fault. There were few times that she would slap me in public for just kissing her, even ehen I kissed her like 2 minutes ago and it was all good. When there were my friends around she loved to tell them that I was weak and insecure, but she made me that way. She ruined all my holidays, every Christmas, easter, new year. We even went to the trip for this new year, and in the new year's eve she began a fight with me over a table that I chose in the club like 15 minutes before midnight, so while others were hugging and celebrating, I fought with my girlfriend. She is so manipulative that she managed to convince me that her behaviour was normal, and that I am just not good enough for her, and I believed in that until one of my friends saw that it went really far and started talking with me about that and really showed me that it's her that has problems and not me. The situations I specified above are just a drop in the sea of situations like that, I maybe didn't even get the best examples, but I can't even remember all the bad things I went with her."
57,"Yes! If it’s a movie where some of the characters look even remotely similar, I have no idea whose who."
58,"We had a regular caller who was severely disabled. They were not suicidal (that's ok) but were homebound, on welfare, it didn't cover their meds, was in constant physical pain. No friends, no family, unable to get out. The person was nice but achingly lonely and basically said they were waiting for their turn to go."
59,"No. I tracked him down by sending his donor profile to my first and second cousin matches until someone recognized the date of birth, education, etc. I sent him a restricted certified letter requesting medical information and he did not respond. He did sign for the letter though so I know he got it."
60,Get a blood test before you have kids...lots of half sisters out there.
61,"I have never heard of someone in their 30's being pulled into that life. How was he able to manipulate you if you don't mind me asking?

Was this man basically a pimp?

I am very glad you are out now and happy to hear your daughter is okay. Do you live far away from where all of this happened now? Do you have any family or other support system?"
62,I'm from the US and have never heard of that
63,You only do it because you want to secretly increase their chances of becoming obese. You pretend to be nice guy  right?
64,So what is your story? How did you find yourself in that situation? Are what age did it start? Are you out now and safe?
65,"I guess it’s not hard enough, I just have a lot of clothes, y’know for every season :D
In my closet are down big jacket and beach shorts at the same time."
66,"Nothing to ask.  I just want to say that I am so sorry that this happened to you and I hope that one day you find peace in this life.  It was not your fault.  You did nothing wrong.  You are strong, courageous, and deserving of true unconditional love."
67,"I'm not really sure how to explain this, but are you ever nervous that when you talk to somebody you've never met before for a brief amount of time (for example, the cashier at the supermarket or the servers at a cafe), they'll treat you differently just cause you're black?"
68,"Does he have delusional followers? You know the type, that no matter how many times they've been screwed over they think he will change or do not believe he's a sociopath and just ""misunderstood""

Also what were the early signs? Asking for a friend"
69,I found cell phones umm but I think by far the weirdest thing I've ever found in a porta potty is literally a females and males entire outfits including shoes inside of the tank
70,"Oh wow it sounds amazing! Is it hard to live with such a difference in temperature during the seasons? I live in western Europe where we have about 25 in the summer and around - 5, sometimes people already have trouble with these differences"
71,"I feel like an extra nugget AND them being lovingly arranged in rows would really say “that extra nugget is not a mistake” because clearly if you take the attention and time to line them up, you would notice if there was an  extra"
72,"""AMA except anything because I'm not answering.""

This AMA sucks."
73,"There’s a character in arrested development who actually has this condition. Not a question, just thought I’d let you know lol."
74,"When I look in a mirror I can recognize it’s me, but I guess I don’t really have a concept for what I look like because the second I close my eyes I can’t remember myself. So every time I see myself it’s like I’ve never seen myself before I guess, and typing that out makes it seem scary but I’m so used to it I don’t really even notice anymore."
75,"oh definitely not. my very first day working at a theater was opening night of black panther, and I can safely say that it was slammed for at least a month"
76,"This is 100% the result of a gene environment interaction. You already were at risk, the drug use just brought out the worst. This cannot happen in people who do not have the genetic risk factors. The problem is there’s really no way to know what your exact genome is, so there will always be a risk simply based on the fact you don’t know.  

If you do want to do drugs, do them well into adulthood. Women’s brains are fully developed at 25, men at 30. Don’t mess up your development.

-ya girl who’s about to graduate (on the 5th!) with a degree in behavioral neuroscience hell yeah"
77,"I completely understand your point of view and how you feel towards forgetting the past. But, as a high school student, all I’ve learned was the past for the last 13 years. When it’s integrated into my learning environment, it’s hard for people to just forget. My school, being predominantly black, intends on consistently making us remember. I have some classmates who, due to the lack of teaching of other cultures, don’t even believe white people have any history besides war and slavery. 

I’ve heard my great grandmother and grandmother tell stories of preaching equality from since they were my age, and though there’s obviously change since then, I will never truly believe that unequal treatment and discrimination can be removed from our world. I’m not pessimistic, but I would say realistic. Yes, we must give everyone a chance, but giving people who take advantage of you the chance over and over allows more people to believe they can do the exact same thing, and it takes history back to where it began."
78,Intentionally bringing attention. I like it
79,Were you able to see it yourself?
80,I talk to about 2 of them regularly. I also have a twin sister and an older brother with the same sperm donor and same mom that I obviously talk to
81,"do you get in any trouble whatsoever? And also, do you eat food durung your shift?"
82,but do you give an extra onion ring in our fries like the BK guy?
83,"Like if you’re a customer seeing us about to throw it away? I don’t think we’d be able to give you like a trash bag of it, but we’d probably offer some anyways. At least I would."
84,Hahahaha welcome to the club
85,"Not me but one of the guys that I work with found the American challenge in one of the toilets that being a 18in 6 inch round silicone dildo 
we suck it to the back of the bosses flatbed truck that he uses for hauling containers still don't know if he found it before he left the yard or if it fell off on the road"
86,If only there was some form of training that could've provided you information on how to barricade and real world situations where barricading did or did not work so that you're better prepared.
87,Take it as a learning experience bro. Now you know some signs of abuse to help yourself and even those close to you.
88,"I'll give you a horror story.  I worked in a movie theater in high school.  I was working my second ""long shift"" of the weekend on Easter Sunday with my then-boyfriend and the girl he would end up leaving me for.  Towards the end of the second matinee rush a guy comes in and says his pregnant girlfriend is in the bathroom not doing well.  I go in and check on her at his request, she says she's fine.  Later he comes back and says she's in a lot of pain.  I suggest that he calls 911, so he does.  The ambulance comes and takes her away; the poor girl had had a miscarriage.  Later I go into the bathroom where she was, and there's a bit of blood on the floor.  Highly distressed, I tell the manager, and she tells me to grab a mop.  The other girl and I clean it up, and I'm upset the entire rest of my shift.  THEN, I go home, and am in the process of telling my parents about what happened, and my phone buzzes.  I got a text--yes, a TEXT--from my boyfriend saying we need to break up.  That's probably my most memorable movie theater story."
89,It definitely is. It almost outweighs the superbly shitty customer service side of it. Almost.
90,"The confederate flag is a weird subject. If you look in a political way, that’s a symbol people used to represent what they believed in at one point in time and should be preserved as if it were that. But, the social beliefs tied to the flag are what make me and others feel negative about it. Like the Swastika flag. Politically, people who support Fascism would refuse to destroy the symbol of character. People in WWI craving a political leader to create order in Germany, who fell innocent to Hitler’s command as their last bit of hope would however recant if they came to this time and saw the result. TLDR: Politically, it’s just another flag. Socially, it makes me a bit scared to go in someone’s house with the huge flag on the front.

I do use the n word. 

It really does depend. My family luckily isn’t very homophonic. I have plenty of cousins who are gay and some aunts who are. I haven’t told my parents I am bi because I’m still just exploring sexuality and finding what I feel, but I believe that my parents would be both happy and sad. I’m their only girl and obviously they’d want me to marry a man and have children in a nuclear household, but not everyone gets what they want, haha. 

I enjoy different food and musical traditions. In a old sense, I love going to Renaissance fairs. In a historical sense, I get tired of learning of black culture in my predominantly black school year after year, so when I learn of gypsies and European culture, I’ve usually never heard about it and love it!"
91,Go talk with the FBI. If it's something serious they will work with you.
92,What’s rotel? I’m from the UK and have never heard of that.
93,What does your brother do now? Is he able to function just fine but a huge dick?
94,"Hmmmm. I would go with 10 five year olds. Reason being I dont think that they are developed enough to organize themselves or use any sort of real strategy. 10 year olds are already aware of the effects of kicking someone in the balls and such. I would also be able to easily out run the 5 year olds if something got out of hand, some ten year olds are pretty fast though."
95,Ever seen any poop graffiti?
96,"It’s complicated. Big percent is listening rap, russian and american, it’s boys and girls 12-30 yo. Other big percent is listening various rock (linkin park, hollywood undead, rammstein, etc), it’s a boys (rarely girls) like 14-22. Also, russian rock is iconic here (kino, splin, etc), it’s everyone 0-40. It’s really tough to say true, ‘cause idk exactly. My favorites are Queen, Rolling Stones, AC/DC, KISS. :)"
97,No - that's also one of the things you have to get used to - lots of emotional investment and then no closure.
98,"He did go to public school for a while, but I’m five years older so we never overlapped in the same school at the same time.... he was kicked out of about 4 school districts, and a military school. He did not have an iep as he was able to manipulate the people who evaluated him at each school pretty well until the inevitable expulsion"
99,"Oh my god that’s not funny, I’m practically crying here!! Well, okay, its a little funny because OH MY GOD!!! But ohhhh I have lived my whole life feeling so fricking WEIRD ... arrrgh!!"
100,"Five different DNA websites: Ancestry, 23andme, familytree, MyHeritage and genesismatch. Also used the Donor Sibling Registry (DSR) which lists children conceived by the same donor number as you."
101,Do you care when white people wear braids or hairstyles that are from African culture?
102,Nah and nah
103,"10 years from now, where do you imagine he will be? Or what do you think he will do?"
104,You're welcome
105,"Making money is cool and all but being slammed every day you show up for work isn't exactly fun. A few days is bearable, but it will wear you down over time."
106,What is it like watching a movie or a tv show? Is it difficult to follow the characters?
107,I found out it was a thing in a highschool psychology class where we were learning about sensory disorders or something like that haha
108,"Wtf lol I have a post from last year that I got like 3,000 upvotes on and even now I still can’t comment on a lot of stuff since it says I don’t have enough comment karma. Maybe since it was from last year it doesn’t count or something. Thank you for upvoting me tho I’ll upvote all your comments too."
109,"Fuck I accidentally deleted the other comment but I think it said how I’m not American, I don’t want to take it to court because of personal reasons and because I believe that he wouldn’t do anything bad to any other girl (he is still obsessed with me so, if he bothers me again I might have to take it to court). but also I wanted to say that even though trauma wise it really bothers me it doesn’t bother me too much because I don’t think he spread it around except for to at least one friend?? It doesn’t make sense how it bothers me and it doesn’t but I really don’t know how to explain it."
110,Were there others that walked out with you?
111,"Good for you for keeping your chin up, you’re amazing 😊 Therapy isn’t a walk in the park, but if you stick with it then you will come out the other side a stronger, even more amazing person!!! Best of luck, you’ll be ok ♥️"
112,"Hi to Romania! I have a sharp continental climate here, so that’s why difference between of seasons is so high. We have a car, it doesn’t start in -40 :D, we need to set the car into a garage to keep it warm every winter."
113,With great power comes great responsibility.
114,"Winter isn’t nice season for me. I have to wear a lot of clothes to go outside, and take it off every bloody time when I go in again. Face is freezing outside, I mean I don’t feel my face at all after 30 minutes being out, so it makes me wear mask. Hands are extremely freezing too with phone, which is gonna be dead in 5 minutes. Plus, I can’t see the sun for weeks because of clouds and fog, it’s sad enough."
115,So what’s up with the alien mystery for GTA V? Aka mount Chiliad mystery?
116,Animated people are a lot easier to recognize because I think my brain registers them as a “thing”. I can recognize animals normally as well.
117,"I'm really not trying to be an asshole here, because I think that everyone is entitled to their beliefs, especially regarding something as polarizing as gun control.  With that being said however, as a teacher, you have a **responsibility** to help protect the children in your care.  

&amp;#x200B;

You go through fire drills in school, so that students know where to go if the fire alarm is pulled.  You as the teacher, are expected to keep your children together and get them out of the building.  This training is teaching you how to best keep your children safe in the event of an active shooter.  The fact that you don't see this as important, is very confusing to me.  You are in place to teach, and also to protect these students while they're in your class.  If a student gets beat up in your class by another student, while you're present and you do nothing to stop it, you'll face consequences because it's your responsibility. This is no different, except more paramount.  

&amp;#x200B;

If someone walks into a school and starts firing off rounds, and you don't do everything that you can to protect these children, you're a fucking piece of shit, and have absolutely no business being an educator, especially an elementary school teacher.  This training is there to teach you how to protect your children to the best of your ability.  Letting your political views get in the way of that is beyond ridiculous, it makes you a fucking coward.  I really hope that I'm misunderstanding something here, and you're not completely disregarding the importance of safety training, because you don't like guns."
118,"First showtime was at 8:00 AM. So theater employees had to be there at 6:15/6:30 to ensure we would be fully operational 30 minutes before the showtime. 

Last showtime played at 2 AM opening night, leaving 5 AM as the time we would get off IF everything went smoothly."
119,"Chicoana and Salta in Argentina. Beautiful, beautiful place."
120,"Who are 3 of your favorite black people who made changes in history?

How do you feel about the confederate flag?

Do you use the n word?

Are black families more or less on board with lgbt family members, do they pressure you to get married at all?

What are some culture differences between black and white people that you enjoy?"
121,That’s so awesome. One hell of a perk to the job
122,r/choosingbeggers
123,I agree and this is something many donor conceived people are trying to get legislation passed on. There is medical information he filled out when he first donated but that was almost 28 years ago and things change.
124,"I don’t usually tell people I have it, so I guess I wish I could just remember people. It’s embarrassing for people to say hi to you in public and you have no idea who they are. I worry everyone things I’m rude or antisocial"
125,Honestly I don't I don't have time for it I've got a  it's eat sleep work if I'm not working my full-time regular job I am helping out a buddy who runs a mechanic shop turning wrenches for extra money to provide a better life that I was provided as a child
126,"More people should be like this. Make a mistake,admit they are human, and apologize."
127,"I found out in January of this year after matching with my first half sibling. She didn’t know she was a sperm donor kid either so we were both confused. I thought that one of my parents had cheated and went to visit them and confront them. My parents instantly started crying and told me the truth.  My social dad (who raised me) was almost completely sterile and has a host of medical problems so even if he had gotten lucky and knocked my mom up it was likely we would inherit his shitty genetics. 

The feelings are very mixed but the one that’s most surprising is the constant feelings of rejection. It’s hard not to take it personal when new siblings have no desire to connect and it was even harder to be ignored by my biological father."
128,"Hmm, I’m thinking it is beer, any beer, but we’re talking about young ppl 18-30, mabe 40. Guys who over than 40-50 prefer vodka and other tough alcoholic drink"
129,"I make $18 an hour and I get 40 hours a week over the winter and overtime in the summer can hit 20 plus hours a week

And I'm actually an ase-certified mechanic with my certifications just expiring this year"
130,"&gt; A certain area in town tends to not allow black kids in the stores. 

Are you serious? That pisses me off so much. Anyone challenging this? I’d love to know where this is but understand if you don’t want to say."
131,In the wintertime the hours drop to part-time I am in the Minnesota area generally speaking and in the winter time there's not a whole lot going on but in the summer I usually expect to see a minimum of 10 hours of overtime per check and that's not including volunteering for special events
132,Thank you so much! I can actually feel myself tearing up dhsjisjsbs. You’re such a nice person for saying this to a random stranger on the internet and I just really want to thank you for that :). Also I know it’ll be hard but it’ll definitely be worth it. Again thank you so so so so so much. It’s honestly hard to explain how a random stranger can make you feel so much better. Best of luck for you too with whatever you are/ will be struggling with. You’re a great person and I hope you keep being nice to people and remember that you’re a great person!
133,"Thanks for being so open about your hourly! Do you get OT? I'm asking because my line of work gives me 20 or so hours of OT, and I'm looking for a new line of work that can give me similar compensation without having to work 60+ hours/week."
134,"Multiples of four get one extra, so eight get 2 extra"
135,How much time you got homie?
136,"I live in Missouri. There’s only 3-4 cities that have large amounts of black people. I live in Kansas City. In this one area, if you bring more than 3/4 friends with you to a store in the shopping center, the cops in the area will ask you to leave. My cousin was arrested last year because of it."
137,"Hi there. /r/SuicideWatch mod and fellow hotline responder here.  We get a *lot* of hotline horror stories of dubious provenance in our sub as well.  

We've thought a lot about where these posts come from and I think there's a combination of factors, and two major groups that are responsible for them.  

For one thing, as I'm sure you know, there are people who are choosing to stay stuck in a ""victim"" mindset and essentially make themselves impossible to help.   These folks tend to get into a ""grievance collector"" mindset and aiiring those manufactured grievances tends to scratch a psychological itch for them. For another, there's a significant cohort of troubled souls online for don't just get off on inciting suicide online.  They are often behind the scaremongering about various mental-health crisis resources.  Of course, everything's on a continuum, and we suspect there's probably an overlap between the two groups.  

These posts tend to generate a lot of sympathy and attention, and then that tends to encourage others.  

Finally, some of the people who report bad experiences with hotlines are 100% legit and factual.  I think they're the minority, but at the present time I think it would be unrealistic to assume that presume that all hotlines give every caller a good experience.  Hell, I've been doing this for a long time and I still mess up sometimes, although one thing that experience really helps with is the ability to salvage the situation when a call starts to go south. 

I hope you'll continue to hang with us over at SW."
138,So they separate comment karma from post karma. Whatever upvotes you get from an actual text post dont count towards your comment karma only upvotes on comments on a post. And I believe that subreddits only count it if it's on their subreddit sometimes
139,Sounds like murder evidence
140,"Hey, I just want to give everyone involved in this thread right here a massive high five. The is the most respectful, well informed, and thoughtful discussion I have ever seen on this website. Everyone listened to what the other person was trying to say rather than just forcing their own point out, and no one ever resorted to attacking the person they were talking to. We need more of this in the world!"
141,Did you meet your father? Tell us about him
142,What were you working as
143,sue her
144,What's the weirdest thing you've found in a potty?
145,How likely is it that someone could get a ton of free popcorn towards the end of the night?
146,Sounds like you made the right decision. Best of luck to you!
147,"I LOVE Stephen King. I do love the following:

Thinner, Gerald’s Game, It, and Pet Cemetery by him. 

When Broken Glass Floats by Chanrithy Him. 

Number the Stars by Lois Lowry

Bang! by Sharon G. Flake

and a few others I can’t think of on the spot. Private message me if you wanna talk more. :)"
148,In my opinion you should be entitled to medical information! It’s important
149,"I'd told my mother technically but I didn't know she already knew and was complicit. 
When we were both about 15 I broke down after drinking and told my best friend, he was the first person I told outside of the family. He was a brilliant support (still is)"
150,Was there like a special screening for the employees or something
151,the contacts were pulled out and put into a bag and the park officials where the toilet was located word given notice that it was there and from there I don't know what happened with it
152,Good job. Psychological abuse is very real and can mess a person up just as bad as anything else.
153,Give me some of your horror story’s.
154,I've grown to hate my job and give extra on everything to my customers food because I want the company to lose more money. lol
155,"Rotel is like a canned pick de gallio, which is like less liquid salsa (tomatoes, onion, peppers, etc).  You can mix Rotel and Velveeta (American fake cheese) and have a nice queso dip."
156,"Haha, naice XD"
157,"Well honestly it wasn’t that hard. It wasn’t really a full on shoot either. In the long ass story with the question how did it happen I also explain it if you want a longer story. But basically, he was a very persistent guy and I didn’t want to have sex but didn’t mind sexually charged things. And even though I said no to sex he was a very manipulative guy that got a lil further step by step. And since we were in a relationship and I knew him very well and trusted him I really didn’t think much of it."
158,I've been doing the job for about two years and I'm 32 almost 33
159,"Yes, thanks so much."
160,How did you manage to locate all of your other half siblings?
161,"Not sure, I only worked on certain parts of the game(s). I think theres over 40 artists across the company worldwide. I think theres something, not sure what is left to discover. Happy hunting!"
162,I’m reading all tour answers in Borat voice.
163,"Yes it definitely does! Hair dye helps, clothing styles help, and if it’s someone I’m really familiar with it could be something small like their gait. Most of my best friends growing up were red heads because they were easy to pick out in a crowd!"
164,"The place I work is surprisingly ethical, they just treat employees a tad unfair"
165,"When you’ve been seriously abused it’s easy for it to happen again. Your wired to believe them. It’s so weird. Your reality has been denied so many times you don’t know what’s right. And it makes you very needy.
This is why she said she was the perfect victim."
166,"I have some now for a matter of fact, and it is possible to wash all the braids, however they will take forever to dry and will be super heavy. The thing is, the synthetic hair doesn’t sweat, my scalp does. So that’s the part that would need to be washed. Some people use dry shampoo, I however just have someone hold my braids out, and i’ll just wash my scalp really good."
167,there have been multiple red flags this is just another one 😂😂
168,There is no need to hope. You absolutely made the right decision. You should never doubt that.
169,"Disrespectful baboon, you absolute cretin, fuck you. You thought you could put a small ""f"" without consequences, but you are wrong, great bag of odorless carrots. This man deserves a big F , and you deserve a beating"
170,"Hey man! East Romania here. How come you have 30+ in summer?? I wouldn't expect so hot,still Siberia. Do you(or your parents) own a car?? How do it starts in - 40??"
171,"1. So if you saw, say, two sisters standing side by side, would you struggle to pick out the resemblance between them?

2. How does this affect attraction? Do you develop crushes on people based on their looks even though you basically forget what they look like when you turn away?

3. When someone has something ‘different’ about their appearance (e.g. a birthmark on their face), eventually you just get used to it after a certain amount of time and stop noticing it. I take it that’s not the same for you? Would you see that person and be like ‘damn, that’s one hell of a birthmark’ every single time?"
172,Where the hell do you live that black kids aren’t allowed in stores?!
173,"Glory to Romania! We are divided 50/50. Young generation doesn’t love current government, but I cannot say same thing about olds, they’re still supporting Putin, not all but still a big percent.
I’m trying to avoid political things at all. Moscow wants our natural gives and that’s all, we have no industry here, only mining."
174,It is it is really gross not going to lie but we are giving the proper equipment to clean those units up and about two years ago right after I started we have one of the biggest wind storms we've had in my area and I spent 18 hours of my day with the order to if you see one of our porta potties to go over clean it up I went through 450 gallons of water that day on a normal day I go through 50
175,I’m definitely out of the normal age range for sure. Due to some circumstances in my life I was in a very vulnerable place and he recognized that and started to be overly generous financially and materially which should have been a big red flag. A few weeks in he turned the tables and I was on the hook for everything and had to “work” it off now to pay him back. The threats and abuse had me too scared to try and get away. I had to leave the province I was living and moved back to my hometown to have my daughter. I have a very supportive family and also an amazing network of other people who I met via the program I went to.
176,What age were you when you first started puberty?
177,Aside from a slight cough from the cleaners we use on the toilet which are acid-based that usually clear up in 10-15 minutes I've never actually gotten physically ill from doing the job sometimes on the other hand the smell makes you rich depending on the situation
178,You know if it's one thing that this job has taught me it's to respect all of the service industry and the people that work in it because there are some jobs that I would hate to do and I'm just glad I don't have to do that particular job and I fulfilled that same role not everybody wants to do it but they want the service so I do it with a smile on my face and a kind heart
179,"I work for a government office and had to go through an active shooter training. The police officer who led the training showed a YouTube video of a man who entered a city council meeting brandishing a gun. He held the council members hostage while he aired his grievances, then shot himself in the head.

The officer made a joke! A lot of my coworkers laughed! I spoke up and said, ""I don't think this is funny! We just watched a man die!""

My husband was a police officer. I know he'd be the first to admit that the job warps a person, and macabre humor is a coping mechanism. 

I also know that any shooter drill will be upsetting and stressful, and people will laugh inappropriately in new, very stressful situations. Still, I think there ought to be an introduction, preparing the audience for what they're about to do, and the gravity of what they're about to experience. And they should explain the role and ask for volunteers, not pick people at random and throw them into a role. 

Cops aren't the most sensitive bunch. They can't be. But, I'll bet they'd welcome constructive feedback, because they really do want to help, and anyone who's walked out didn't get potentially life-saving information.

Anyway, here's my question: how're you feeling? I imagine you have lots of feelings. I'm interested to know some of them."
180,Do you get a lot of matches on tinder?
181,Nobody dressed up at our theater but I did see people dressed up at other locations!! Guess we weren’t cool enough :(
182,"Yes, I am really messed up, and I just realized that. I lost contact with many of my friends, my relations with my family got colder, and I am pretty depressed at the moment."
183,how did he got you to do the shoot?
