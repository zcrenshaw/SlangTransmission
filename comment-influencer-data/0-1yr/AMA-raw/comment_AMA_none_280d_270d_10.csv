0,Do you plan on slowing down and saving some for the rest of us?
1,"Hey bro, I want you to Google ""Dr Mary F Holley Meth"" and 11 items after the first item on the list should be a PDF titled ""how reversible is methamphetamine-related brain damage."" It would behoove you to read that. I was an active drug addict for 18 years, with meth being the final straw for the last 3 of the 18. I'm telling my story to kids to help them know what is in store for them if they do it. 3 months before I got out of prison, my mind, even though I knew I never wanted to do dope again, still thought ""its okay, when you get out, one time won't hurt."" After reading that PDF (while in prison), I forced me mind to move on.

I've been clean for 26 months now. I still dream about it rarely. It's hard to get over, but it's the only way to go. Leave it behind and leave the person that gives it to you behind as well.

I would love to have you on my team. I will give you focus and maybe you can help me too. Just let me know if you have any questions. You can do this.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the silver! OP needs as much support as he can get right now and I appreciate all of your kinds words to him. Keep on encouraging. It's those that know they have a problem that deserve our attention. Ultimately though, the decision is entirely his. No one is going to make you get clean. I *chose* to get clean. He has to as well, and I think he knows it already.

Edit 2: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold! Much obliged! If anyone wants to check out my project, please feel free to visit www.everymistake.org. I'm not trying to take away from OP, but enough people have liked my post, I would hope that those that liked it would also like to see what we are doing to help prevent kids from ever going down the same path as both OP and I have experienced ourselves. We DO have the power to make change, but change doesn't start from nothing. A seed has to be planted and then watered for things to grow. Thank you everyone.

OP, you the man! "

6,"You emit some kind of chaotic energy. Probably a hilarious guy, but seem like a mad man to most people. You talk really loudly. You wish you could travel to Europe, but the flights are too expensive. Probably the type of guy I would have a beer with, even though I would feel 100% threatened by your presence."

12,Surprisingly you don't wear a kilt. You voted against Brexit and burn pictures of Margaret Thatcher on the daily. You're a ginger. And you think braveheart was a shitty film due to historical inaccuracies 
13,I'm struggling to remember exactly but it was most likely a stress ball. Holding my wife's hand with my eyes closed and telling her I was feeling it was the most intense though.

17,You think Danes are superior to all other Scandinavians and are not afraid to voice your opinion. You might be into poetry. You probably are very interested in filmmaking or reviewing films. 40% of your diet is sausages but you're somehow still skinny. You might be an author one day 
18,Your name is Victoria. Your parents still put a large portion of their income on purchasing expensive clothes for you. You work as a receptionist for a company you forgot the name of.
19,just call it a day and go gome
20,"In the adult film industry, it was work. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt absolutely love my work. I loved who I worked with and for. I loved the experiences and the people I grew to know. There were a lot of uncomfortable positions and ‚Äúwork‚Äù, but I enjoyed in the context that I was performing and giving material to people who were going to enjoy it. 

If I am understanding your questions correctly, I can say all my choices now are ‚Äúreal‚Äù in the context that I don‚Äôt do anything I don‚Äôt want to. I love the sexual rush. I love the satisfaction in know men and even women, are turned on by me. I love being a safe place for married men, who otherwise may love their wife but aren‚Äôt sexually satisfied. I love the taboo and the rush. "
21,"it's because they thought you were ACTUALLY THE Danny Dyer haha! Just had a quick browse of your gram, looks like the most incredible job ever. Now for my question, are you hiring? I am a huge fan of Grant's! "

23,"I know some Russians...  You like to fuck around a lot. Your main hobby is pissing people off and pranking your friends. You are really loud and obnoxious in public (maybe drunk as well). You only stop being annoying once one has gained your trust, then you become a very kind, warm individual. You always want to bum a cigarette, but it is worth giving one to you; you always have interesting stories to tell once you have calmed down a bit"

27,"You're totally off base, but you get a point for the casserole comment.  In Florida, it's hurricanes, not tornadoes.  I do have a friend named Bethany.  "
28,"Interesting. I keep my wife happy by *not* playing ""Danger Zone"" by Kenny Loggins everyday. What is it about Mr. Loggins that is such a Siren Song to your wife? "
29,You're the man Steve!
30,"Lol, yeah pretty close although I do have a kilt (only for weddings) and love Braveheart (even with the inaccuracies). 

Everything else pretty spot on, just on my way to the Tuesday night Thatcher bonfire at the end of our street now to cook some marshmallows"
31,"Yes, that‚Äôs from Amateur Allure... Paul shoots all those scenes independently. He gave me a different name the two times I was on his site though, it‚Äôs not under Barbie Cummings. I got to drive his Ferrari in one scene. ü§ó"

34,"Lol... well, when I am class mom and volunteering on the PTA for school fundraisers and run into little Ethan‚Äôs dad who I fucked last week, smiling with his wife; I don‚Äôt know, they definitely don‚Äôt meld. "
35,"I come from near poverty. My mom had to work 60-80 hours a week to keep my brother and I in a decent town, but we never had any money to speak of.

I just do whatever I have to do to save money and have at least $2000usd plus a credit card. When I get settled and working, I make that up and more, so I never leave a place broke. I just prioritize saving and preparing for the worst. I don't buy myself cool things or drink in bars or go to $150 concerts.... Whatever I've gotta do to have that cushion/launch pad. "
36,A lot of relief.
37,I'm an American... from Florida.  Mid-40s white woman.  Can't wait to hear. 
38,"how often do you run into these ""local married men"" in your ""normal life"" context, and how does that interaction go? "
39,"They actually called and it was in Arabic so that was very fucking weird and got us anxious. 
They mostly write online (twitter) since it‚Äôs much easier for them "
40,What was it like getting a letter with isis as the return address? Was it like ‚Äúoh... I think I know what this is about...‚Äù or was it like ‚Äúholy fuck this is terrifying get this letter away from me‚Äù? Or something else entirely?
41,"So, I had quit drinking for about a month when this all began, and I was still having trouble with my energy level, motivation, etc. Mind you, I wasn't even a daily drinker but more of a binge drinker. An acquaintance at work noticed that I seemed off, and asked me if I wanted an Adderall. If I remember correctly, I legitimately laughed and asked if he was serious. Adderall was something high school kids did, right? Anyway, I accepted it and then it sat on my dresser for a week.  


Finally one morning I was off work and had a whole laundry list of things to get done. I figured *what the hell* and took half of it. If anyone has tried Amphetamines before then you know precisely how I felt about 20 minutes later. I was able to tackle every task at hand that day with energy to spare.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with Adderall is that it's a prescription drug, and therefore quite hard to come by consistently. Having made a habit of taking it regularly, I had begun to develop a tolerance and even legitimate agitation when it was unavailable. I knew this was a red flag, and was almost relieved when my source told me it would be weeks before he could get anymore. I shrugged and said, ""Well, it was fun while it lasted,"" and moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later he approached me again. ""I still won't be able to get Adderall for a while, but I got something better.""

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind, I had no idea how Crystal Meth worked until that moment. I live in the heart of Opioid Epidemic country, and Meth had taken a back seat in 2005 with the Sudafed restrictions. But, I was about to find out exactly what the drug was and why it is the stuff of nightmares.

46,"Not as often as maybe it sounds. Periodically, maybe at a school function or seeing them in passing in public. It never really is an interaction. They don‚Äôt fear me invading their lives, if they see me and have any nervous feelings they definitely don‚Äôt portray it. They also know that I respect their discretion greatly. "

50,"I am currently enrolled in an outpatient treatment program which utilizes group sessions, as well as individual counseling sessions and medical appointments. The program has been helpful so far, but I am still very early in the process. 

The most formidable obstacle I've noticed with Methamphetamine and its addicts in particular is that unlike Heroin, Alcohol, etc, there is no Antidote, no craving destroyer, no quick fix to help you build up your willpower. You are very much at war with your own brain and mind after withdrawals begin, and it's a matter of doing everything you can to get your Dopamine status back to a healthy level as quickly as possible so you stop feeling like you will literally die without the drug.

I've heard it said that a Meth user never relapses more than once. Because if  they quit the drug and then relapse, they never quit again. Certainly this isn't true, but it does shed the substance in a chilling light, which it much deserves.

I've also spoken with Heroin addicts who have told me they would never touch Meth, never had the courage to. This is not downplaying any other addiction, not in the slightest. However, it was a fist to the face of my delusions that this drug would be easy to shed.

62,"I worry about public confidence in science and in researchers. I worry that this will lead to a backlash against a technology that is currently very widely used in biological research and has incredible potential for so many aspects of medicine and technology. I worry that people will vilify CRISPR as a whole when, in reality, its use is only controversial in certain very specific circumstances (germline edits and use in humans). We've seen this kind of thing before -- Jesse Gelsinger's death in a clinical trial that he should never have been allowed to enroll in set back the field of gene therapy for decades.

But more than any of that, I worry that this case won't have any impact at all. This was unethical, unapproved human experimentation, plain and simple. There are two baby girls out there right now who have any number of off-target mutations resulting from this intervention. The CCR5 mutation that He Jiankui \*did\* manage to introduce isn't the one that he was aiming for, so we also have no idea what that will do. At least one of the girls has mosaic cells (two or more genotypes) and we don't know what the effect of that will be. There's some evidence that CRISPR edits can trigger cancer so we don't know if that's a concern for the health of these girls going forward. And I worry that none of this will matter and we won't see any sort of sensible regulation at all and these kinds of rogue experiments will just keep happening"

We need to know all of the lines, junctions, tunnels, lines, stations, signals, signal boxes and everything else on a route.

93,"Porn is great, watch it all the time. Sex work is fine, I couldn't do it myself but that's neither here nor there for the people that can. Group sex is great, I've had it, enjoyed it, and the couple and I went on with our lives. Having sex with someone you know to be in a committed relationship without the consent of the other party is wrong. Full stop.  If they know and are cool with it, fine. If they want in and everybody is cool with that, fine. Otherwise, that moral shortcoming lies with you, and you alone. Not the cheating, the cheating is obviously the fault of the husband and no one is saying it isn't. But there is more to the story than ""it's his own fault!""

I don't hate you, and I don't even think you're a bad person, but this logic is fucked. ""They'd cheat anyway!"" But guess what, now they cheated with YOU. YOU were the vehicle by which they broke the most sacred commitment of their lives, betrayed their partner and children, and changed the dynamic of their marital relationship for the rest of its duration. With not only your full knowledge, but some weird satisfaction you draw from this. 

""But their wives are shitty/shame them/don't have enough sex with them!"" None of your business. People's relationships are there own to judge, fix, change, or gtfo of if they aren't working. You do not get to ""be their safe space"" when their safe space should be their wife. If she's not, leave. Then fuck whoever they want in whatever configuration.  

The sex is not the problem here. Sex is great. People should have more of it. The problem is the duplicitous nature of what you're doing. You are thinking about your own feelings, and the feelings of the men you fuck, but obviously the women in their lives mean fuck all to you. They have feelings, shortcomings, insecurities, etc etc etc as well. They are people too, who deserve to be communicated with rather than cheated on. If that communication is just ""I want out"" so be it. Again, no hate. But you're blas√© attitude about other people's relationships and boundaries is worrisome to say the least.  "

I don't want to assume they just sponge from their parents, but a week long holiday usually ends up being quite pricey for me, so I don't know how people can go away for six months and not run out of money.

That said, having read some of your comments, it seems like you take joy, you revel in the fact that you are somehow better than other women bc men want you over their wives. Youre eager to please men, who are otherwise unsatisfied, bc it means that you‚Äôre achieving something their women can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a superiority thing for you. It feeds your ego. It makes you feel valuable and important and powerful.

It‚Äôs also kind of sick, tbh. 

The way I see it, you‚Äôre not empathetic towards men, you don‚Äôt want to help them be happier (as you‚Äôve mentioned a number of times). If you were empathetic, you‚Äôd also be empathetic towards the women whose husbands are betraying them. You do this only for your own ego, point blank. "

130,"All scotch whisky is high quality in my eyes as there is so much time effort and skill involved in making it and Grant's is no different. We have been blending Grant's for over 100 years and its the job of our Master Blender to create our blend each time.

 It takes a lot of time to create Grants as we use twenty five different single malts alongside our Girvan grain spirit to create a whisky that must taste the same today as it did five years ago and five years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

The taste is rich smooth sweet and spicy it tastes like a Speyside whisky. Fruity and easy going which means it works well neat with ice or in cocktails. 

We don't just have Grant's though we also have single malts like Glenfiddich and Balvenie as well as Hendrick's Gin and Sailor Jerry Rum to name a few.

&amp;#x200B;

Yea as far as advancement goes I am not too sure. I don't think anyone could do this job for fifty years but I love doing it just now. I am sure there will be other roles within the company I could go for but I just don't know. I am quite hyper and don't do well sitting at a desk so who knows what's next :)"
131,"Wow that was brave of her.
I‚Äôd be scared shitless.
But it‚Äôs true $500 cannot replace him.
I‚Äôm also kind of shocked they would care enough to let you know and offer anything.
But I mean I‚Äôm not saying they are suddenly saints for informing her or offering her money. 
I just figured they wouldn‚Äôt say anything and he would simply disappear.
How scary though.
I cannot imagine how afraid I would be getting a letter from Isis much less a phone call. "
132,Living in a trailer on your cousins lawn is also shockingly accurate based off of my (American) stereotype of Florida 
133,Basically just a more quiet Australian. It pisses you off that New Zealand isn't on any maps. You might be geographically gifted
134,Jono wtf! Is that actually you. You played fifa in the lobby of the Hotel with the english lads! Reddit is a beautiful place! How the hell are you?
135,"What do you mean two lifes, what is the difference in those two?"
136,Anything fun happen at the Christmas party?
137,"That's a tough one. Going to have to say Back To The Future, because I watched it so many times when I was a kid."
138,Jesus I'm way off on this one.. I used to live in Canada 
139,What was the last thing he said to you or his family? 
140,"Shit, I thought 2019 was going to be a good one for me, now I find out, I won't be getting laid because you exhausted all of em'"
141,Do you think this technology will pave the way for cybernetic enhancements? Do you think enhancements will ever be commonplace?
142,Do your kids know? What were your specialties?
143,"The mom of one of the girls reached out to me over Facebook to tell me what happened. Kind of a ""hey, I caught him and my 12 year old daughter having sex and he's going to prison in a few days"" kind of thing. She was more tactful and serious about it than that though, obviously lol"
144,"You have the most exiting night life of all the people in this post. You drive a motorcycle that you tuned to go fast on your own. You wanted to become a football player in your teen years, but your partying has started taking a toll on your health. The first impression people get from you is that you are a douche. However, you are in general a very respectful person."
145,Can i donate to your legal fund?
146,It‚Äôs rough.
147,"My girlfriend is half Finnish and has lived there on and off, and while I've never been to Finland I hear quite a bit about it! I wonder what I could assume about you? From your username I think you are probably a young student living off government payments, or possibly in the military. Very quiet and reserved in real life but extremely silly online. Your older family members have very strong opinions about the civil war and/or communism. There are several items of Moomin merchandise in your home and most of your furniture comes from IKEA. Your family has a summer home you visit regularly. You dress in sort of a punk/alternative style but aren't really terribly rebellious. You drink a LOT.

Anyway, 20 yo man from Alabama USA. Hit me with your best shot!"
148,*thick in the warm*
149,Can you feel pain or temperature etc? Or is it just the feeling of having an object in your hands?
150,"Two questions:

1. Does Grant's make a higher quality whiskey or is their good stuff marketed under a different name? We actually serve Grant's at our hotel but it's the cheapest Scotch on the menu. Just a random blend I pulled off the bottom shelf at the supermarket as not being the cheapest but almost. I didn't even know Grant's was a major brand until I saw this thread. But it could be that only this cheaper blend is sold here in Mexico.
2. What sort of career advancement will be available from this position? I'm presuming this is more of a marketing schtick rather than you being able to get paid to do this for the next 50 years, no?"
151,"Hey, do you remember that time we were demolishing a motel in Brisbane and I fucked up my shin and asked for something sterile?"
152,Are you prepared to be hassled every single year for another donation? I made a one off donation of $5 in 2013 and still get emails asking me to donate again. 
153,"You still live with your parents (who are incredibly rich). You haven't had a single job your whole life. You aspire to become an influencer. You are probably intellectually gifted, but waste your potential on trying to become a model on instagram."
154,"Hey, I mean if you really want to"
155,"I didn‚Äôt have to but his mother took therapy and anti depression pills I guess
"
156,"I am so happy you are okay, but only hope his mother can heal and know peace. I am a christian, but whatever else is going on we both worship the God who spoke to Abraham, I will pray for her."
157,Why do a Christmas party on a Thursday?? That‚Äôs asking for trouble. Ours is tomorrow night. No work Sunday and staying at the hotel it‚Äôs in! 
158,"Pretty sure I remember this...

Amateur allure was like the first porn I found when I hit puberty. I downloaded a bunch to my secret stash (I liked the way the O background light looked in the eyes). 

Pretty sure you pulled the Ferrari into the garage and got a little frisky on the hood? I think it was a red 360 spider? 

Anyways, if it was you in that video that's pretty cool and I just wanted to say hi. Thanks for the memories of your mammories. "
159,"I know that ragging on the trains is almost as popular a national sport as football, but as an American, I have to say that I was absolutely amazed by the experience of rail travel when I went to the UK. Fast, efficient, and far cleaner and more reliable than the limited amount of public transport available in the US. Riding the trains was one of my favorite things during the trip and I'd love to come back and just spend a week traveling throughout the UK by rail.

Also all of the conductors were very kind and patient with this American who didn't understand how my rail card or the reserved seating system worked, so thank you to your coworkers! "
160,"Do you know how he died? 
Was there any culture clashing for him growing up with a Kurdish background in Denmark?"
161,What looks good usually isn‚Äôt what feels good and what feels good usually looks ridiculous. Learned that a long time ago...
162,"I didn't want to spend an annual leave day, and I did have a couple of things I needed to get done today."
163,"This varies from company to company. I work for a company that pays middle to lower average. I am contracted to 4 days a week and my basic wage is ¬£29,000. If I work 5 days a week, with commission on top, I make around ¬£37,000."
164,"Quite close I guess. The only point is memers from Germany often spread memes making fun of ourselves like how we managed to start and loose 2 world wars or our language.

And, on top, I am not an engineer but still a student so who knows."
165,What‚Äôs a Wikipedia?
166,"I don't think that's an unfair comparison -- I've been using the analogy to Nazi experiments in trying to explain to people why this is a bad way to approach science. A lot of the Nazi experiments during the Holocaust produced good data that we still use today --  for example, information on how the human body handles pressure and G-forces, which is important for people like pilots. But as a society we have also decided that these experiments were WRONG because we believe in bodily autonomy and informed consent. Both those last two points are lacking in this case as well. The girls had no choice in this matter and there is mounting evidence that the parents may not have been fully informed about what they were agreeing to."
167,"Saving money makes sense, but the question is how do you make money?"
168,"Do you think you will need to find a new reason to be? Or at this point you're just going to cruise through life and watch, since you did your part?"
169,Not a chance. 
170,did not expect something so positive lol nice
171,move to japan :)
172,Thanks for sharing this. 
173,I don't know if I've ever masturbated while thinking I may have cancer at the same time. 
174,Germany
175,"Soo the question will be asked anyways, I'll just ask it sooner... if you masturbate with that hand does it feel like someone is giving you a handjob? Or are you too afraid to let a super strong robotic thing anywhere near your genitals?"
176,"hmm tough choice but if I had to pick, ass"
177,"I was once on a quiet train and this guy, clearly a crazy person locked himself in the toilet so he didn't have to pay. I wasn't going to tangle with him because he was clearly a lunatic. At some point he got paranoid and thought that I was locking him on the train. We got to a station and he got off. He then tried to strangle me up against the train. I was lucky that there were staff about and we got him off me."
178,"Jesus, this is terrible. Is this like fun or funny to some people? Is something wrong with me that I think this is totally fucked up and makes me want to puke..? "
179,I‚Äôve been told that meth is so much harder to kick because it‚Äôs not physically addicting (besides the fact that  you feel like crap) but physiologically addicting (guess more similar to alcohol in that respect). I‚Äôve seen my sibling battle an alcohol addiction and so many times...and so many seizures..we didn‚Äôt think he would make it. Please keep fighting hard for yourself but especially your daughter. She needs you. You have your whole life ahead of you and better times await. 
180,Did you ask professional help at any point? Especially from public services?
181,"This. Leaving a (positive) legacy is something I feel we're all meant to do during our time here. Most do that in the way of raising children. I figured since we don't have any, this would be my way of leaving my mark. My motivation everyday is knowing how many lives this could impact. It's a very humbling feeling and I feel like this is bigger than me now."
182,There are no dry eyes in this room either 
183,I am very lucky I lost my non-dominant hand so I don't normally write with the prosthetic. I do have to use the prosthetic to write the word 'letter' as part of one of the exercises in the lab. I can do it but it's pretty sloppy.
184,"good question lol.  Luckily, this happens very rarely (like only a couple of times over hundreds of scenes)  but usually a couple of hours."
185,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think ""devoted wife"" and ""fucks local married men"" even make sense in one sentence. 

But hey, I'll keep my mind open for now. Here's my questions. 

Are you really not that worried that your son is going to come across you on a porn site one day?

Why not service single men? Why be a home wrecker? 

Why'd you offer to blow the officer if it wasn't too get out of trouble for having illegal pills?
"
186,I don't know why they put it on Thursday. Cheaper perhaps?
187,I am 32. 
188,they were awake in the beginning
189,"Your guess is as good as mine lol. He called me once he was in prison and I asked him that very question. His answer was, ""I didn't think the judge would send me to prison. It was obvious that *little girl's name* consented."" Some real fucked up shit. He truly believed the judge would say, ""Okay yeah, little girl was already bein a hoe so no harm done. You good fam."""
190,Irish. 
191,"You may be a taxi driver. You grew up religious, but don't believe it anymore. Are kind to tourists. You have a short temper and go from friendly to pissed off very quickly"
192,"the organization of that alone would be too stressful, not to mention what am i supposed to do with my hands, so your answer is no."
193,Pooing on a greater Anglia train the other day as we got into Ipswich. The door opened then proceeded to open and close as infinitem. You are never safe
194,Congrats! First thing I did was check out your audition video and now I read all of your replies here with your voice in my head haha. Cheers mate!
195,We were but some of them get brainwashed as well. The Kurdish people actually killed him
196,"Nerd alert!! 80% of your time is spent playing video games. If you're a guy, you might be studying physics. If you're a girl, it may be gender studies"
197,haha no.  Usually if I want to bang them again i'll just try to do it off camera
198,This is so true it hurts. There are no more interesting AMA's anymore.
199,"The doctor seemed pretty confident that I had nothing to worry about. She told me I should get examined again in a year, though."
200,"Okay.

So, we had two female cats, a beautiful Siamese-looking one named Baby, and a calico who was given to us named Mama.

Now for a bit of backstory on Mama. She was originally a family friend's cat, but the lady could not stand her so my mom took her in, as my mother did with any stray living creature. Mama quickly became possessive over my dad and if that cat saw my mom kiss him she'd pissy on the stove burners. The lady who gave Mama to us failed to mention that she was a petty little shit and straight up lied when she said the cat was fixed.

Baby's story was simple and cute, me and my siblings found a small white kitten that was friendly and as we hadn't gotten our mom anything for her birthday gave her the kitten and breathed a sigh of relief that we were not the worst offspring in the universe. 

The cats got pregnant. First, Mama, which led to an amusing (for me) phone call from my mom to her (former) friend, then Baby. So we went from 2 cats, a reasonable and somewhat normal amount of pets, to 9 cats, a far less reasonable number of animals in a 2 bedroom house.

It was at this time that my mother became know as the cat lady. 

My mom, having to wrangle this many animals and kids, developed a unique whistle to summon all of us. She used dinner time for they cats as a way to pavloivianly train the cats to come to this sound. She found it also worked on us kids as a byproduct. 

People just started bringing my mom cats. We only got 3 that way, bringing the total to 12 at this point. Then Baby and Mama got in the family way again, and so did a few of their daughters. All in all, we had 35 at the time of 9/11.

They were house trained and could be picked up by anyone, just generally loving cats that were indoor/outdoor pets. But someone in our neighborhood had reached the limit on what they would tolerate and called the Humane Society on us for animal hordering. When the lady showed up to investigate she was startled at how all the cats were healthy, happy,and trained to come to a whistle. 

Unfortunately the county we were living in had a strict 2 animals per 1/2 acre lot law, so she had to take some of our cats. The officer let us keep 10 and helped us get the fixed so we'd not have another kittenocolypse and the rest were adopted out in less than a week because they were just great and loving animals in good condition.

201,This is often the case if you're not involved with starting a site or the ownership of the site.  I didn't have to go that route
202,What's it like to know a student somewhere a hundred years from now will open a history book and see your name?
203,"If he gives a good enough answer, I'm out of this place."
204,Does she have massive hands?

206,"I am a woman. And I have a very high sex drive whereas my partner does not. I have been depressed about it. I‚Äôve felt like he didn‚Äôt love me and I was disgusted with myself for the longest time. I thought there was something wrong with me.... BUT, you know what I did? I communicated all of this with him. I told him exactly how I was feeling. You know what happened? He changed, he started trying more. I felt the connection again. I felt loved again. You know what I didn‚Äôt do? Go fuck other people behind his back. Do you know why? Because I love him and that would break him. And quite frankly, I feel disgusting doing that. We are all entitled to our own opinion, I just felt like sharing mine. I don‚Äôt mean to offend you or anyone else. I just wanted you to know that you are hurting so many people by doing this. And you have no idea how much pain you are causing them. Maybe, instead of providing sex for these men... instead you can sit them down and tell them to communicate these things to their partner. Instead of engaging in a sexual act with them, maybe you can help them through these feelings they are having and help them regain their sex like with their partner. I don‚Äôt know girl, I just feel like you should have more empathy. I‚Äôm sorry, this is just heartbreaking. I thought woman should stand together, instead you are beating them down. "
207,"Alcohol addiction is fucked because its something you encounter literally every day.  A lot of people dont understand how brutal it is as well.  Imagine a heroin addict going into recovery then walking down the street with signs with pictures of heroin, spoons and needles with people looking like they are having a good time.  Going to a restaurant and people are just shooting up and all you have to do is ask the waiter for some heroin.  Being at the supermarket and walking past a heroin isle, you guys get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Dont even get me started on how dangerous alcohol is to come off."
208,"No, Sweden. Surstromming. Fermented shark might be horrible but Surstromming is apocalyptic."
209,I was thinking more along the lines of scratch offs. 
210,"If I could offer you one piece of advice in life it would be this. Try everything once except incest and Morris dancing. If I could offer a second piece of advice, it would be to not even look at a railway line the wrong way. It is so much more dangerous than you could ever imagine. Just stay away."
211,Do you play team fortress 2
212,"I want to say there is no antidote for alcoholism either.  There is antabuse, but it just makes you sick when you drink, but you still really, really, really want to drink. So one day you just skip your dose and drink, then it's off to the races again.

Addiction is hard. Very hard. And recovery is tough, but it is absolutely possible.  

You are also right about being at war with your own brain.  Some people can't understand the struggle that an addict has. On one hand, I can completely know that practicing my addiction is unhealthy, but my own mind... My thoughts... They lie to me, and they're really fucking good at making me not even notice how bullshit they are.  

Your addiction wants you dead. Whether by its hand or your own.  There is nothing left for you at the end of that pipe. No matter what your mind tells you, you have to accept this.  Nothing good will ever come from using ever again.

It may have been fun once, but now all it holds is death, and probably not even right away.  You would go through an extended period of absolute hell before it decides to end you. Each time is exponentially worse than the last.

People can quit more than once. They can relapse and still get sober, but I can tell you from my own experience that it is much much harder the second time around.  Your brain will try to convince you that you'll just be able to sign up for outpatient again after a quick hit.  My experience was that it took me almost five years to come back. I'm lucky to be alive. I'm luckier that I have found happiness in life, where once there was only darkness and pain.

You can do this, but you need to know that meth has nothing to offer you. Not just because I told you, but because it's true.  It will happily take what's left of your dignity and life and not even give a shit about what that does to you and those you love.

Keep seeking help. Keep taking advantage of your support network. Never let your brain convince you that you're cured, and can use again without anything less than consequences worse than the ones you've already had.

There is hope. Stick with it, and you can find happiness in life again."
