17,"No one who has known me has assumed that I am anything but female, In fact most look twice after I tell them there‚Äôs part of a penis down there. 

As said on my birth certificate, I am intersex. Nor female or male. Just intersex. But I definitely have more female characteristics

Sexual experience is a bit rough, I haven‚Äôt had enough to really speak of it. But I have a long time partner who I have engaged with. Usually now when I meet people, somewhere in our friendship you learn about what I am. That‚Äôs how it was with my partner. We were friends first and he had heard rumors of it. But when we spoke about being more then just friends. I had to sit him down and explain, again thankfully I have majority female genitalia on the outside except for what appears to be just a separate, a little longer flap of skin (that was once, before I had a surgery to fix some health issues that came with it, the start of a penis)
Unlike most though, I lack in sensitivity, especially sexually. So that‚Äôs a thing.‚ù§Ô∏è"

32,"This entire post is nonsense and so is OP. Go through ‚Äúher‚Äù post history. I‚Äôll summarize the things she‚Äôs claimed. 

Has a long term boyfriend, wait fianc√©, wait boyfriend- of one year, 2 years, a few weeks, and have been living together for over a year. Has apparently a different boyfriend she met a few weeks ago who moved to Spain and she was supposed to go there to live with him but then he sent her pictures of a dead body that I guess he killed and now she doesn‚Äôt know what to do and has been seeking legal advice. 

Is apparently working full time, going to school full time, and taking ‚Äúseveral additional math classes‚Äù and plans on taking the Swedish Sats. Which apparently means trying to get into Med School. 

Is apparently trying to get Pregnant- with the fianc√© or boyfriend who deff doesn‚Äôt exist.  

Has BPD. Borderline. SpD. Sex Addiction. Drinking Addiction. Anorexia. Bulimia. Schizophrenia. PTSD. Hurts and cuts herself. Anxiety. Depression and plenty more. 

Here‚Äôs a choice snippet:

‚ÄúFIVE DAYS before the trip he is out partying, on some drugs. In the middle of the night he sends me a picture of a body, like bloody and scary. I freak out and delete everything and just lay in my bed for hours. When I ""wake up"" I decide to call him, he's psycotic and basically tells me he killed someone and I freak out and just hang up. I didnt know what to do since he was in another country. I message him later but he don't answer. He doesnt answer for two days. So I start to search this countries newspages and finds A LOT of articles about him, that he's murdered a man, and when confronted with police he killes a police officer and then he's shot several times.
This is TWO days before my flight to that city is leaving. I have to book a hotel last minute because I cant cancel my flight tickets and then I spent a week there all by myself which was so weird. And then, I never dared to go to his funeral because of his wife and kid but then reads that his funeral took place ON MY BIRTHDAY.‚Äù

I don't hang out with anyone who might get me in trouble.  I had one guy in prison who gave me a great education on other options.  It was a variety of things.

Going to prison is (for almost everyone) going to make you more likely to live a criminal lifestyle than less.  Prison is crime school.  Its not just what you learn but who you meet.  There is no rehabilitation in the places I was at, not even a show put on.  Its punishment and warehousing."

40,"I'm gonna be really blunt here.

You deal in bullshit. 

I am a co-founder of a business, and I can tell you that if someone came to me with ""POS operator"" on their r√©sum√© instead of ""cashier"", and tried to fluff up their r√©sum√© with meaningless rewordings of things that could be stated more concisely, it would be a serious strike against them, not a point in favor.

If I hired people with fluff like this in their r√©sum√© over people who were more succinct (and truthful), I would effectively be screening for bullshitters.  I don't want bullshitters.  I want people who are straight with me.

What you are doing is rewording things so that they take as much room up on the page as possible, but the whole point of r√©sum√©s is that they boil things down to only the most important points.  It should be as concise as possible.  Fluff is very much a no-no."

44,It depends on how developed the hermaphrodite is. But its true that most are sterile

53,"I have my degree in criminal justice and while most people follow a recidivism route, people like you are the reason I believe in rehabilitation and wish it was more focused on in our prison systems.

1.  I knew even then was that if I missed my chance with her that she would be ""the one that got away""

2.  My wife was always out of my league.  Think Kourtny Kardashian without the duck face.

3. I benefit still from a calming influence.  When I was younger I needed it so much more.  My wife is a masters level social worker and a trained crisis counselor.  Without her I have no doubt I would be sitting in a cell today instead of my heated leather passenger seat."

Keep in mind I was framing 50 hours a week.  I was in fantastic shape."
127,"School was weird. I would get 90s and above on most of my tests, but I never was able to get homework done because of my ADHD. I would get low grades and have to explain myself to the teachers time and time again. Most were understanding. It was my English teacher and guidance counselor who helped me out the most.  They were the first ones to actually have faith in me and not see my struggles as character flaws. So many times I heard the words ‚Äúif you just put in a bit more effort‚Äù as if I wasn‚Äôt trying enough already. 

Unless I am completely comfortable with the person, social interactions are almost always a disaster. I am always trying to be aware of what I am saying and how they are reacting. This leads to me sort of turning into different people depending on who I‚Äôm talking to, especially throughout middle and high school. It got much, much better when my former best friend and I stopped talking. It was early high school, and she was mostly preoccupied with being friends with the social elites and just dealing with people who were fake and didn‚Äôt care for you. After breaking things off, I started making friends that actually cared about me, and that really made me come out of my shell a bit more. I learned that, when my brain isn‚Äôt pushing me back, I‚Äôm actually an extrovert. Who knew?"

145,I don't know who Smasher Man is but he sounds treacherous!
146,"A few questions if you don't mind. 

No problem.  Im on mobile so who knows how the formatting will end up.

1) Do you consider your time in prison to be a waste of your time or do you believe you needed prison to mould you into the man you are today? 

Both.  I am probably better for it.  Cleaner, more patient, more understanding of other peoples faults and defects.  We only have so much time in life though, and its hard to say I didn't waste some of mine.

2) How did you find prison? Was it easy? Hard?

Boring.  Very boring.  10 days of soul crushing boredom and 20 minutes of adrenaline.  I did 9 months in solitary once for repeated fighting.  You find out a lot about yourself in solitary.  I read the bible cover to cover a couple times.

 3) What sweeping prison reforms do you think are needed, if any, to help convicted felons rehabilitate and contribute to society? 

Teach them skills.  Woodworking, heavy equipment operating, framing, coding, knitting, sewing, anything.  

4) When you got of jail did you experience any discrimination being a convicted felon?

Here and there.  The worst part is something you wouldn't think of.  My first house in suburban spot was when my boys were young.  I have to register as a ""violent offender""  no sex crimes but I hit a cop one time and now have to register like a sex offender.   When we moved in noone would let their kids play with mine.  It was very clear.  I built a bad ass deck on our house and some neighbors asked for quotes and I did some work for some people.  It got better over time.

5) How do you feel about pineapple on pizza

Are you some kind of monster?  They should have prisons for people like you!  
Pineapple is for spaghetti."

149,"If I can be Frank (and you be Jamie), your confidence also seems to be pretty close to 0 or at least that's how you're portraying it in this AMA. Women find self confidence super attractive and it's amazing what you can attract once you have that. 

A close friend of mine is about your height and he has an amazing fianc√© because he's literally one of the most genuine sweetest guys I know that's confident in himself and has *never* let his height get him down.

Stick in there bro, you're young I was still awkward around girls at your age. I'm saying all this out of encouragement and not despair.  :)

We still spend a little more than we save monthly.  Our tax return this year was a total blessing.  So far we haven't tapped into the smallish 401K that I have."

160,"Thank you.  I met my wifes family early in our relationship.  She didn't even know I was a felon then.  I told her when we started to get serious.  

She grew up in a really small town.  Her parents are not angels, but not felons either.  Her dad was actually a prison guard (not where i was though)  by the time they knew about my past they were already solidly in my corner.  I get some bullshit from her sister about how I don't deserve what I have, but her husband beats her and they spend their evenings in a budlight haze.  I earned everything I have so she can get fucked.  Fwiw I am the executor in her stepmom and dads will because I am good with money and they know that we don't really need the money.  They don't worry that I would take something."
161,You one of those real buff short dudes?
162,"Well for me, I went off to rehab. From rehab I went to a SLE (Sober Living Environment)  where I could not stay sober for a while. I had absolutely no money to my name at all. There‚Äôs a term for alcoholics that are sober but are not actively working on themselves and it‚Äôs called ‚Äúwhite knuckling‚Äù and that‚Äôs what I was doing. If I was sober, I was still talking about drugs, or watching drug show tv programs. I eventually was kicked out of 3 SLE‚Äôs and was living either with females I had met on the street, or behind a grocery store. 

So I was homeless here but not for long, I was busted for shoplifting socks &amp; lunchables from target and that was for some reason all I needed to push me to get sincerely sober again. I found a gf at the time who had lived in California her whole life. Her &amp; I now live in her since passed on, grandfathers house. 
But to answer your question when I left for rehab I had no money to my name what so ever. I had small assets like a motorcycle and other shit but nothing of any value."
163,"How did it affect your school performance? 

How do you deal with social interactions?"
164,"Communicate absolutely everything. If there is not 100% percent open communication, the relationship is doomed. Both people should be able to feel comfortable talking about anything and expressing all of their emotions. If they don't, that's humongous problems waiting to happen. If your partner can't tell you when they're sad, then they won't tell you when they're lonely. Then, they won't confide in you. It's just constant slippery slopes like that. 

Keep the channels open, keep the minds open, excitement with everything, respect each other's boundaries, and respect each other's personal lives. That last one sounds the roughest but me and my girlfriend have an understand that my life is still mine and her life is still hers and our relationship is where they overlap. There are days where she's out with her girls, there are nights where im out with my guys, i work, she works. We can't be texting or calling or video chatting 24/7, no matter how much we want to. Being able to be separated without someone getting upset or jealous is an acquired trait"
