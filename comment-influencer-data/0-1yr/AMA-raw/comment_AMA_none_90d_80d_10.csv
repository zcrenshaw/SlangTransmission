0,Enjoy the severance lol. He was dumb for firing you; could cost the company a lot more
1,"Hey sweetie,

I’m sorry for your loss. Can’t imagine what that must have been like with you being so young.  I’m sure you already know that your dad loved you. I don’t know how any dad could hold their little baby girl in their arms and not be moved to tears with joy.  I hope you understand that it’s not about you. Just like my sons decision was not about me. For whatever reason they were hurting and couldn’t figure it out. They chose to make a permanent decision for a short term problem and now we don’t get the chance to move forward with them in our lives."
2,Blink once if you’re a hostage
3,"Hey there random internet dad, i lost my dad to suicide when I was 12. Any advice for a random 30-something internet daughter?"
4,Is your ice cream machine working?
5,"last i checked, yes, surprisingly"
6,"There are so many that the one that keeps coming back to mind is a simple small moment. He must have been five or six years old. I was in a reclining chair when he walked up beside me, rolled on top of me and told me I love you dada and just hug me and laid there for several minutes. He didn’t want anything. It was just pure love."
7,"My advice, if you’re happy you’re happy. Fuck the haters that say you don’t know what’s out there."
8,Does everyone actually believe that? Or do you just think they believe that?
9,"*Michael's sad, hopeless look intensifies*"
10,"It seems like your boss may have overreacted a bit, was that the case or was it justified"
11,*Whole world wants to know your location*
12,"How does a penguin build its house?

Igloos it together."
13,"Nope, I'm a nice person, the unfortunate thing with kids in my generation is bandwagoning. If one person decides to believe something about you, and that person is popular, then that belief will grow and spread throughout the school."
14,"I eat around 3000 kcal, which is common in Japanese high school students.
There is little obesity in Japan.
Is it understandable? I'm not good at English."
15,"Unjustified, I work harder then most of the employees,  worked about 15-20hrs a week just in over time. Colluges not really sure how to handle the rest of the week.  Really scrambling at this point."
16,You can think about 90%
17,Thanks for all the questions and great responses everyone. The wife and I are going out to enjoy a meal together. Will check back later tonight to respond to any more questions you may have.
18,"If you could go back and fix one mistake you’ve made in your life, would you go back and fix this shitshow of a title?"
19,"Not too often. I think she is beautiful and amazing, so the need just really isn’t there for me. I think if that is something you do on a daily basis then maybe marriage isn’t the right step. You need to know what you want if you’re constantly looking or fantasizing then you don’t really know what you want and that kind of commitment isn’t right."
20,"Thank you for your kind words. I’m sorry to hear that your real life dad hasn’t pulled his head out of his backside enough to man up and have that difficult talk with you. He likely either knows how bad he messed up and can’t face it or is completely oblivious. Don’t forget that even the worst of us still usually see themselves as the hero of their own story.

You are worth an apology and your internet dad wants you to know that you not only matter but that you are a super duper special limited edition one of a kind rockstar!"
21,"Happy Father’s Day, Internet dad! 

I do believe you’re the only dad I’ll be saying that to this year. My dad is still alive but he treated me badly when I was a child and when I confronted him about it, he said he needed to take some time to come up with a response. That was two years ago. I suppose I’m not worth an apology. 

I’m sorry you lost your son, but judging by your loving memory of him crawling into your lap, I am sure he knew how much you loved (and still love!) him!"
22,Same thing happened to my uncle. He put in his retirement notice gave the company 3 months so he could train a new guy and the boss fired him lol... thanks for the extra money boss.
23,How much does japanee highschool life resemble how its portrayed in anime?
24,Sadly it's not a generational thing. It's called mob mentality. The Salem witch trials is a perfect example. What grade are you in?
25,"My actual words were ""I'm giving two and a half weeks,  so you can find my replacement and I can train a few solid employees on everything I know about this position. "" Doing the right thing I think looks weak to the management.  Instead of saying alright and leaving it at that, they sometimes just have to end it on their terms.  I want to say it's a power thing,  but maybe it's just the person."
26,what happens in the freezer stays in the freezer.
27,"No questions, just wanted to say me too! Started dating in highschool 10 years ago and it'll be 6 years married this summer."
28,"There are many many stories. But most homes followed the same formats. Some were just looking for money, some were looking for the perfect child but lashed out in anger when they couldn’t fix me, some were abusive, and some were sweet old ladies who only wanted to help but the sweetness of them made the other homes all the more bitter. Most were just people who had been doing it for years and made you feel like cattle being traded."
29,Cough if she's watching your eyes.
30,Shhhhhh she’s right there... but no very happy not a hostage. If I felt like that probably would not have made this.
31,We are both 25 and started dating in middle school
32,When you quit did you just put down the cigarettes or did you finish your pack first?
33,Oh perfect! How much food do you eat in a day? And isn’t obesity in Japan uncommon?
34,"My son, 11 years old, was standing on the ledge of our house once after an argument we had. I didn't get really mad at him or anything but he was so disappointed with himself that he didn't see another way out. Luckily our neighbors talked him back in. He is doing great now and we got some help. 
So my question, and I hope this isn't too hard on you to answer, thinking back what were the earliest signs that might ever do something like this?"
35,Canada
36,"No questions but thanks for posting. It’s very encouraging to hear an example of someone being okay (or better, it sounds like) even if the face of tremendous adversity!"
37,I finished the packet however it was half planned that I’d be quitting that week and it seemed like a convenient starting point. I quit a few days before my actual planned date.
38,I am sorry for both of y'alls loss. I am praying for the both of you. Stay strong.
39,"If I make an attempt, I usually get shut down pretty fast or ignored."
40,the good ol grill and seasoning on the quarter pounder. most satisfying atleast.
41,"Michael, now we have to pay him severance..."
42,"From my standpoint there were no warning signs which is why I felt so blindsided. The first year after losing him was me playing the what if game in my mind searching for answers that simply don’t exist. He had the usual teenage temperamentalness but like I answered earlier, the real change in him developed after he had his skateboarding accident."
43,"1. yes i occasionally eat at mcdonald’s. however being around it so much it’s not always my first choice.

2. i have a 20% discount but since mcdonalds is already cheap it’s really whatever, doesn’t influence my decision much.

3. there are certain procedures that you always have to do, but there are certain things a chef can do differently. i suppose how clean they keep their work area and how well they manage their time really, as time is almost always of the essence."
44,Hugs... see you on the other side. None of us are making it out alive. Whatever waits us cant be too bad. I'm sorry you're going through this.
45,"If it is a paid regular thing, there are many things without a mosaic."
46,is that true! ? It's very fun. Now I am the student president.
47,"At the very least, OP could likely get unemployment from being fired like this"
48,"I'm replying to this bc I think it's important. OP, other people may not think that. I was always a weird kid, but it was before everyone went around labeling the weird kids school shooters. Things will get better. There are so many places in the world that you haven't visited and have no idea if you'd be a better fit there. I assume you're in high school, and some people have this idea that it's supposed to be the best time of your life. It's not. You have so many more years to meet new people, find hobbies, find new interests. Don't let this time in your life define you."
49,The boobs to people ratio is probably lower too
50,"never tried anything on it and have never had someone order off it, but it would be a little more work for the kitchen boys."
51,What's your favorite way to make burger there?
52,"1. Well there are 4 positions in the tank. Tank Commander, Gunner, Loader, &amp; Driver. The gunner is extremely cramped you sit in a tiny seat and operate the turret( top part of tank). The Tank Commender can sit or stand and has minimal leg room. The loader can sit or stand as well but has the most room so he can load the rounds. The driver has a seat that is reasonably comfortable and in the hull of the tank(bottom part of tank) the driver is mostly isolated from the rest of the crew. Overall it is pretty cramped. And it smells like Oil most of the time. But you get used to it and you realize you have all the space ya need.

2. Well you can join the army at the age of 17 with a parents permission. And then you have 15 weeks of OSUT to train. So you can be operating a tank as young as 17. A few of young guys who first get to the unit have their tanks license before their actually drivers license. 

Hoped I answered well!"
53,"This year, extremely excited"
54,Opinion about the secret menu food?
55,I understand and I figured. Thank you for answering
56,Completely fine is not the way I would describe it.  I survive is better serving.  I have issues but I manage. I manage to keep my company afloat and a pretty decent life for my family. Some days are better than others. My options seem to be thc and cbd over a cocktail of pills. The pills turn me into a zombie.  The weed keeps me normal... level?  I know I'm addicted because going without is not pretty.
57,of course
58,We called that the McGang-bang in my day.... real classy.
59,"&gt;If a workplace fires a qualified employee, they need to pay severance

This is true approximately nowhere in the USA."
60,"Always haters about everything, if that stuff gets under your skin, man marriage would be tough. Thanks for the well wishes!"
61,watch anime
62,What’s your favorite memory with your son?
63,"YOU ARE AWESOME! Keep fighting for your democracy, this is super important for your future. I heard they suspended the extradition bill, which you were a part of! Rooting for you HK 🇭🇰 ❤️"
64,"Good for you OP.  Did you tell your doctor that the iron pill was depressing you?  Where you generally ""meh"" before you started taking the iron pill?"
65,"* Do you eat McDonald's?  How often?  
* What is your discount, and how does a discount influence your decision to eat a meal there?
* How do you judge the McDonald's foods prepared by other chefs (at your own store or other stores)?"
66,Lasagna! Was delish!
67,What portion of jobs actually pay a severance? OP didn't mention where/what level he works at.
68,"There is a lot. 

I was sort of an absentee dad for years, but always paid generous child support. I started to get some things together and became a part of his life and realized he was in a bad living situation with his mother so I took him out of it. I was doing well financially and things were going great. He's a tough kid. We lived in a nice area and lived well. Then I lost my job and caught a felony. Sad part is that a lot of my meltdown was due to mental illness and I had been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for some time. I had to do a brief stint in jail, but lost my job and place. I had no reliable family to help. In fact, I was the person who people came to for help. He went to foster care and it wasn't bad. They were good to him and he still went to the same school and schedule. I spent the better part of the year working and saving money and was thisclose to signing for an apartment that was across the street from a large park and pool and library. Then I got laid off. It got to the point where I was faced with living out my Prius with my son or having him in a safe place. So i made that choice."
69,"Holy hell I'm actually early on an AMA. Okay...

What's your favorite fast food burger?"
70,Is every piece of Japanese pornography blurred or there is a hidden market?
71,Lol I’m also currently a Japanese high school student. How’s life going?
72,Thank you.
73,"Throw1Away1451, I join others in saying I'm really sorry that this is your current reality; I fully believe that it will change and I hope you find at least one ally/friend to connect with before you leave that school.  

As a high school teacher I am curious to know if teachers, at least, 'see' you; that's a huge thing for me--that connection with each of the students in my class, my letting them know that I see them both in my classroom and other places around school.  I bet that even if you don't realize it, at least one of the adults in your daily world really sees you--they may just not know how to let you know that in a way that doesn't seem to single you out in front of your peers.

Thank you for posting and for letting us see you.  Know that you are a valued human being; you are loved; you are worthy of friends and affection."
74,"I think it is a very sad event. The deaths of many people all over the world, the people who can not see their families, the things that war produces are all bad things."
75,The idea of being able to drive a tank before you can drive a car is infinitely entertaining to me. Thank you for your service!
76,"You heard it here, folks."
77,Are you planning to shoot up the school?
78,"ethelexpress’s boyfriend, we do not spit into your food. we just remake it correctly.

we’re normally too occupied to take that time away anyways."
79,"Relatable but my dad killed himself on May 4th. His funeral was yesterday.

What should I do now?"
80,"After you graduate HS, no one gives a sh** what happen in HS."
81,I am more afraid for those I am leaving behind and the grief they will have to go thorough. I am pretty sure I’m headed towards non existence/end of consciousness. l am terrified but at the same time I hope I just will not know anything anymore when I happens.
82,Except all the height of the people and the romances?
83,How old are you both?
84,"My grandparents on my mom’s side both smoked heavily until they were in their early thirties and then quit together (in the middle 1960s, when quitting was still unfortunately ahead of its time). They’re both still alive, so it pretty much worked out for them."
85,"What's for dinner? I just took my dad to my favorite sushi place, and the waitress who always serves me was very happy to meet him."
86,"As a person who hires and fires people, this is just stupid management. I would never do such a thing and actually work with that employee that is leaving to get the position filled and trained so it doesnt upset any other workers, and also keep the business streaming right along. Ive heard of stuff like this happening before and it just baffles my mind."
87,wendy’s- if that counts.
88,Why don't you ever plan on quitting even though you know you're addicted? Do you function completely fine smoking 24/7?
89,Only if I earn it and I’m going to play literally like there is no tomorrow.
90,How often do you look at/fantasize about other women?
91,"No, it has not changed yet. Correctly, Mr. Abe clearly describes the Self-Defense Forces in the constitution and is trying to make it easier for SDF personnel to work. There will be no more than a dozen years for the SDF to become an army.
However, I think it is good to be an army. It is hard to say that Japan is in a situation where it is being defended by American forces like now, it is not independent. As a country, you should be able to defend yourself. In addition, I think that there is no problem because the military does not run away even if the military can be in Japan now."
92,"Yes, I want to America,England and France."
93,Do you talk to them?
94,You really dig the quarter pounder.
95,"So 2 things.

First, it’s my opinion that suicide is pretty much always a selfish act. The person feels like they’re going down, hits eject, and it’s always the people that love them that have to clean up the mess and live with it.

Second, my son had a traumatic brain injury the year before when he crashed at speed on a skateboard while he wasn’t wearing his helmet. In retrospect I can see now how much his personality was change from that event. He wasn’t the same guy anymore. When I looked at him he was the same but inside it changed him. Traumatic brain injuries are horrible and I believe that had a great deal of impact upon his decision to end his own life."
96,"That’s a bit ridiculous your boss would do that, sorry you’ve gotta go through this"
97,"I love and miss my mom very much! My mom was 46, had raised me (28 in 2015) and my siblings (18yro twins in 2015)..she was divorced in 2010, was an alcoholic and diagnosed with primary progressive  M.S. in 2012. She had a lot of pride and did not accept her disease. My siblings and I try very hard to let our mom's decision stay as her own and not let that become our guilt or grief."
98,"quite honestly, the quarter pounder"
99,"&gt;colleguages

Criticized him for spelling but then you went with 'colleguages'.  😂"
100,18 and a half
101,I worked there for almost 2 years while in highschool. I highly recommend putting a Mcchicken in a double cheeseburger and putting BBQ sauce on it!
102,At this point pretty much but my Batman is my theatre teacher. We actually started a dead dads club with the three other girls in my class with dead dads
103,Ty. While we likely have different belief systems I appreciate your words and sympathy.
104,"First. Yes I can certainly be proud of you. I hope you are living a life that you believe matters. I hope that you can carve out some time to travel and see new things to expand your horizons. And most importantly I hope you are learning a little more about yourself each year to eventually become the best version of you that ever was!

Second, there’s no best team. There are only the ones that peak your interest. If you haven’t found one yet, you will."
105,"This is so refreshing to read. It seems like it’s so normalized to fantasize regularly about people that aren’t your partner, and I get that it happens occasionally, but you summed up my thoughts on it way better than I could have!"
106,I’ll trade you an M and an upvote for that N
107,"Thank you very much!

We played the original Halo together on Xbox and we’re both into Magic the Gathering. Many a battles were held in house with him usually winning at Halo(not close) and me at MTG."
108,"Respect yourself. Love yourself. See the value that only you have. There are far too many young ladies hiding behind clothes and makeup trying to be something that someone else is. You are not only good enough, but you are one of a kind. Remember that.

My favorite thing recently has been mowing the lawn on my new mower. I have a large yard that used to take over 2 hours to mow with my old mower. The new one does it in half the time and is really enjoyable to ride around on."
109,Did OP go back to jail during this post?
110,"I used to smoke weed in the freezer, ever try it lol?"
111,"Tough one without knowing more detail.  Being your internet dad is  important job and rule number 1 is do no harm. The obvious answer is to be yourself and be honest.  We don’t ever want to have to put on an act to please someone else. No matter how great they are in the end it won’t be worth it to us. Besides no one can keep that up. I think that sometimes we build things up to be so large in our own minds  that we turn it into a bigger deal than it really is. And then top it it all off, we worry about the outcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

You could do something just as simple as pull the person aside for a second to let them know that you find them interesting. You don’t even have to make it romantic or sexual in the beginning as all you are really doing is seeing if you two are interested in one another. If they don’t feel the same way then isn’t it better to go ahead and know that so you can move on? I know I would rather than being hung up on someone for the next two months?"
112,Could u explain the situation 19years ago?
113,"Honestly, English is too difficult for Japanese people. It is because the syntax is completely different. There are more than six classes a week. However, it does not improve well. So I started reddit to get used to English.

114,"Happy Father’s Day, internet daddy-o.

What’s your favourite board game or video game? Did you and your son ever play together?

If you haven't spoken to her in that long and you've felt this way the entire time, you could be setting yourself up for some serious emotional issues. I say this, because I did it. Limerence can be a powerful thing. Don't let it get out of control. Talk to the girl."

This means a lot."
128,Aren't you scared one day to wake up and regret not having other experiences?
129,"Hi random internet Dad! Happy Father’s Day. As someone who survived a suicide attempt, I want to say sorry for your pain. I’m sure your son could not, at that time,understand how much it would hurt you. I have two questions for you. What’s the best sports team to support? And can you be proud of me, since my father never was?"
130,I married my only boyfriend.  We have been together 15 years and watched couples get married and divorced during that time.  You do you.
131,Do you mind telling us about some of your experiences in foster care?

140,"Ok let’s see what I can do;
Cancer got him when I was fourteen, a little over a year ago

We broke mainly copyright laws which I won’t disclose in case someone from playbill gets ahold of this post

I write really long, intricate fanfictions in the marvel fandom that have gained a rather large following but stay anonymous 

I am questioning but not on drugs because I am poor and afraid of drugs

I dress as my d&amp;d character, lady Gwendolyn le fay. Basically a mix of medieval princess and Queen Titiana from Midsummer Night Dream

I did aerial silks and dabbled in hoop and flow but never got good enough to perform that way, I quit bc one of my bosses (it was co owned) was fucking insane and would just not pay me and made my hours weird.

I don’t have a hard set plan. Ideally I’d like to go to Broadway and try and be a professional member of Actor’s equity or a director like Rachel Chavkin, but overall I’ll probably major in mass comp and minor in theatre and try to get a masters in theatre so i can teach

I don’t have an agent because nothing artistic I do makes me money lol I’m by no means a professional

And uh yeah definitely but they’re kind of just larping so who am I to judge

Hope that answers some stuff!!!"

My dad was abt 20 years older than my mum, and from a generation, that did not show too much affection to my brother or me. My mum was loving, kind, hardworking and raised us.
Fast forward some years, my husband was cruel, and although I had 2 young kids, and was an immigrant, with no family or financial support, I left him, got divorced and am raising my boys as best as I can. 

Men in my life, as dads, have been sadly lacking the qualities that would make a child or family feel secure. 

As a single mum, what can I do for my boys to make them good dad's. They are teens in HS  and ways off...but pls advise. I am moved by your lov to your son, and would gladly take advise.

164,yes
165,"One of my favourites was this hippy chick named Willow. She and I were SOOO different from each other, and we lived in the same 4-person dorm for several months.

She worked a little bit here and there, doing whatever, while I worked hard for a corporation. I'd come home to find her sitting crosslegged in front of a crystal ball, teaching a yoga class in our bedroom, giving someone a tarrot reading or leading a drum circle in the living room. I was part of a relatively mainstream religion at the time.

She was polyamorous, I was celibate.

We were different in so many ways, and yet we grew to be close, like brother and sister. We were so curious about each other and had such amazing conversations, learning so much. People who saw us together we see the stark difference in our appearances and yet see how much we obviously cared about each other and would often be surprised.

Eventually, she moved out into a cabin in the woods, doing organic farming and composting shit and taking baths in the river. She is one of the most beautiful human beings I have ever met, and it's always a joy to see her when I run into her from time to time."
166,"Wow you set up this AMA for a lot of questions.  
How did you lose your father and at what age?

What laws did you break and did you get into trouble?

What are you famous for?

So are you gay or on drugs?

What costume do you wear at the Renaissance Festival?

What did you do in the circus?

What do you plan to do after school?

Do you have an agent?

Do you think that it is a little weird for a billionaire single man who dresses up to take in an adolescent boy and make him dress up and fight other people in costumes?"
167,"Unused Nicotine Patches for the first 7 weeks. It was actually an 8 week course but I felt confident enough to come off a week early. 

Aside from NRT (Nicotine Replacement Therapy) I ate and ate and I think most importantly stayed of alcohol for the first 5 weeks as I knew I weakened when I drank."
168,Finally the one essential question
169,"I wouldn't refer to it as a short term problem - that's not fair. Some of us are wired differently - no amount of medication, counseling, exercise, diet, etc. will every result in happiness; it's awful, but it's reality for many people. Sometimes the pain/sadness/anxiety/depression causes so much suffering (internally/mentally - something that one could never understand unless they experience it day in and day out) - that suicide is a means to an end. An end to that suffering. I would support a suffering cancer patient with assisted suicide and see this as something that is no different.

I'm not trying to upset anybody, but rather give a glimpse into why some people go down the road of suicide. Imagine your best day - the joy/excitement/happiness.... now imagine not actually being able to feel that or understand that. What are you left with? The worst parts of life. It compounds day in and day out. While I wish cures were out there, I also find peace in the fact that some people are no longer suffering."
170,when will you answer any of the questions?
171,"Do you play league ? or are u willing we can spend sometimes i'm in a desperste need of company 
How is your day?"
172,"My dudes you're all commenting on the wrong post, this is a crosspost"
173,What sort of duties do you have as student president?
174,"Hello I have never thought about it, but there are a lot of things. It is a problem that there is a lot of trash."
175,"&gt;Japanese people are not good at English

Is this based on location? I'm an American and when I visited Japan in 2017 I found that almost everyone I spoke to was much better at English than they thought they were. Take yourself for example, you said in another comment that you're not good at English, but I can pretty easily understand your responses here even if the grammar isn't perfect.

I came away very impressed with people's English skills during my trip visiting Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto, Hiroshima and Hakkone."
176,"Well if I had to choose, I would definitely pick weed over and type of pain medicine without a doubt. I just couldn't imagine smoking every day of my life since I only smoke to relax and chill. Best of luck to you boss!"
177,"Happy Fathers Day, Internet Dad!

Just wanted to say that. My biodad left before I was born and my abusive (now dead) stepfather never deserved any well wishes. 

You've done a great thing today, allowing strangers to pour out their hearts, souls, questions, and greetings to you. There are too many of us out here, orphaned and alone, and you alleviated that, if only for a moment. Bless you, Internet Dad."
178,"Fortunately not, although I once did have a roommate who was under house arrest. That was... interesting."
179,Do you sneak a nugget wrapped in cheese every once in awhile too?
180,"well depends what really.

we work with a tray system, cooks fill the trays, put them up front and when people order them, food prep guys take them and make them. 

certain foods can take a while to make, and making one piece of meat for one sandwich would screw up the entire flow of the kitchen, as there is urgency almost 90% of the time. 

however, the quarter pounder is cook to order every time."
181,Mom’s spaghetti
182,I don't have a question but I used to live in Japan. I miss it a ton.
183,I don't have a question. I am from Hong Kong too. Good luck to all Hong Kongers!
184,"So basically, China is imposing a Bill where China can arrest Hong Kong’s citizens even if they don’t violate Hong Kong law."
185,Are you in prison?
186,"Apparently it did, according to Alexander Yuvchenko who is a surviving worker of the power plant."
187,Good AMA....
188,"No question from me, but congrats! Good to hear you’re still chuggin’ along."
189,Blink twice if she's reading as you type
190,"can you please tell my bf that you guys DO NOT spit into food? Every time our order is wrong &amp; I ask for it fixed, he goes ""omg no they're gonna spit in it""."
