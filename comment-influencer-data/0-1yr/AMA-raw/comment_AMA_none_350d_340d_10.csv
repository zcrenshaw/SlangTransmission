2,"Low point for sure.... but you dodged a bullet. 
Devote your time to self improvement. Work out, run, read and try new things. Join a club. Spend less time on the net. Pick up more hours at work. Buy new clothes.

Cut off all contact with her. Do not visit her profile/s. Do not respond to texts, calls or messages through friends. 

Do not try to find a replacement or go looking for a relationship right away. That will come naturally if you follow the previous instructions. 

Don’t keep your shared friends unless they reach out. 

Don’t nope around.... and most importantly, don’t take her back if she sees you are looking and feeling better and tried to reconnect. 
"
3,"I'd actually laugh, it'd be super cool and it would leave the guy dazed and confused"
4,no idea. this person's followed subreddits are giving me an idea what type of person this might be tho
5,"Wtf Jim. ""Oh that's okay I didn't like her anyway.""

What about your friend!?!"
6,Try posting this to r/TwoXChromosomes with a serious tag and you’ll get a lot more traction. 
7,"How’d you feel if you get this account gilded, rather than your own because of your massive balls? "
8,Do you know who’s account it is?
9,"Happened to me too, in fact a lot of the details of your story are the same in mine.  6'2"", 215.  She was 4'11"" or so.  Woke up to her going down on me, threw her off to go throw up, made it back to the bed telling her to stop.  Woke up later to her riding me.  Put that shit deep down in my psyche and ignored it for years.  It's recently manifested because of the movement and I'm having trouble dealing with it."
10,"I don’t like bringing up double standards, but if the story was reversed and a man did this , the man would get crucified. "
11,"think of a college kid that has depression, thats me"
12,I'm so sorry you had to go through this. The police need to take everyone seriously. 
13,"Make sure you get tested for stds, I'm sure in your condition she didn't bother putting a rubber on you. "
14,"probably an ""edgy"" memer. leaning right politcally, but that really doesnt matter. likes memes, funny stuff in general and isnt too off the wall with their interests. regular person. probably a male, if i had to guess. "
15,Can I give you my login info and receive my psych evaluation as well 
16,Thank you kind stranger. 
17,"I did, and everything was good, thankfully. 
And no, she didn’t. "
18,What’s the most interesting?
19,"And that’s part of the problem. People like to pretend they don’t exist, but they’re very real. "
20,"im not gay, but 20$ is 20$ dollars"
21,What are you like OP? 
22,"nothing really bad, but as a WhiteSox fan, him being subbed to r/CHICubs is upsetting"
23,"Yes for sure, I get erections a lot easier, also I have more confidence around women"
24,"We don’t speak anymore, and I’m not upset about it in the slightest. "
25,I wish for you safe travel
26,Wonder how big this account can get before this gets fixed
27,"Go to r/psychology and talk about how you are wholly forgetting things,  and that you are scared you are getting dementia."

30,A lady in santa Barbara picked up a bunch of us homeless kids when I was 17 and cooked us homemade tamales. She let us take showers and stay there for a few days too. It was great.
31,"Did you report this once your sobered up?  If so, do you  happen to remember the officer's name that laughed at your claim?  If so I would report him.  "
32,Doing an AMA was such a brilliant idea!!! 50 points for Gryffindor!
33,He's posted on r/roastme
34,"All I see is nothing. Comments are spoken to me through an unknown voice surrounding me, and I must speak my replies. It’s blacker than black, blacker than any other black that exists. In fact, it isn’t even black, it’s just nothing. Nothing is a different color than black, there’s no way to explain it. I don’t feel my body, the void just surrounds me, movement feels pointless."
35,Think he would be your homie if you met? 
36,"I occasionally speak to her, not frequently though. I see her around the holidays, but that's about it.

She claims to be mentally ill and that was her excuse in court, but she has a bad history of anger problems and some drug use. She had a motive for doing it, so i feel like she is just using mental illness as an excuse. On the other hand you have to be somewhat mentally ill to wake up and decide to kill 4 people. "
37,"Do I downvote or upvote?
Also, does it suck to have a ground harness?"
38,lol if you'd like
39,I don't have a question. Just noting that you're gathering the owner tons of karma.
40,"What would be your description of this person, if you had to guess? (Please be detailed)"
41,my college
42,"She killed my aunt, two of my cousins, and a social worker."
43,"prob not. im sure hes a good guy, but i doubt we have similar interests  "
44,"I need some upvotes to, could I get some?"
45,"No porn on this account, this must be his main account. Now you have me curious aswell"
46,This should be a sub. Psych evals by redditors based on an OP’s post history. 
47,"yes, its been fun to see the number go up."
48,"What does it feel like to be deleted, is everything white, black clear or just a vacuum."
49,Where is the computer you're using? 
50,"Agreed, and thank you. "
51,"He'll probably get removed. If not, then he will get traction and people supporting him"
52,"Great question.  On one hand, no.  But on another level, absolutely.  Take my alcoholism as an example:  I am VERY lucky as I have never relapsed since I hit my low point 8 years ago.  One of the reasons for that is that I 100% accept that I am an alcoholic and most decisions I make moving forward in my life have to take that into account.  I have turned down many invitations to things which, on their face, seem like so much fun, but I knew would be a risk to my sobriety....especially in early recovery.  As I sit here today I don't regret a single thing.  My worst day today is truly better than my best day when I was drinking.  With all of that being said, I try to live in the present day and do not define myself by the successes or failures of my past.  I hope that makes some type of sense."
53,"Thank you! This was all great advice, just super hard to want to apply right now. I just feel so broken and alone, its hard to think forward at all. I know this kind of stuff happens often and my situation isn't any harder than someone else's, but I genuinely feel hopeless right now. It doesn't help that I quite literally don't know of a single person I could talk to, about what's happened or just anything to take my mind off of it. "
54,"No, it shows like that when your account is deleted. I’m signed in with my account still deleted"
55,$20 they bang
56,"Well obvious first question, who did she kill?"
57,"I hope this does not deter you from speaking your mind on political topics like this. Getting such a reaction, negative or positive, means that you reached people and I'm proud of you."
58,I initially downvoted this comment. Then I realized I was actually downvoting a fellow cubs fans post. +1
59,"Shit bro, college drop out with depression here. Hope everything picks up for you fam. Nows the time to be vulnerable if you wanna talk. "
60,"Thanks dude :) I'm not fine now, but i will be"
61,Have you noticed any benefits from not viewing porn?
62,"Wtf, a bot correcting another bot."
63,Have you even read posts in that sub? Supporting and speaking out on women’s rights does not go hand in hand with bashing men. I have never seen anyone bashing men in that sub. Men post there and they are taken seriously and supported.

65,Do you let those events and conditions define you?
66,"Damn I’m going 15 days without watching that,

What made you quit?"
67,ǝɔᴉN
68,"I seen a movie like this once, it didn't end well please reconsider. "
69,"Very much so. Also way more stressed than when I had a steady job.

Working for yourself is a double edged sword, but the highs are very high."
70,"Ditto. That cop failed to do his duty and needs to learn that he was wrong. It's too late to change what happened to OP, but it may save the next unfortunate victim from being ignored."
71,My mom lost custody of my little sister. The social worker she killed was the one working on the case and my mom also believed my aunt and cousins called DCF on her. 
72,How did you post your title upside down?
73,Not of age lol
74,As a hobo - what was your best free meal
75,Are you happy?
76,"You may not be, but not all us 'deletes' are children! WHISKY."
77,"Thanks....I first did a 3 day, inpatient, detox program.  I then did 28 days of an intensive outpatient program (IOP) and then joined AA.  All three were critical to my success.  AA literally saved my life....of that, I have no doubt.  I rarely attend anymore but that is not because I don't believe in it.  I just do other things with my time.

I also quit my job the day I was ready to kill myself and stayed unemployed for a year to work on my sobriety.  I went from a very high earning professional to unemployed, on state aid, and nearly bankrupt during that year.  It was worth it.
"
78,Good bot
79,Sounds pretty lit. 
80,Sleep
81,"It hurt at first, we had been friends for 14 years.  But it was a pretty serious offense and they weren’t very remorseful for, so that made things easier. Haven’t looked back since (this was about a year ago). "
82,too*
83,What’s the worst sub he’s subbed to?
84,"Right now I need more coffee before my 0900 meeting. 

As for the situation, I don’t talk about it much but I’ve coped with what happened. I hope my experience can help change the way someone thinks about sexual assault. "
85,"I know it's a cliche, but everyone we significantly date is for a reason. She might not have been *the One* but she taught you something that brings you closer to the person you actually deserve. Sounds like your life revolved around hers and she was the only one sustaining your life force. Vibe on a higher level, heal, love yourself. You'll attract your otter. "
86,"if you have any ideas, let me know"
87,"Terribly, in fact. 

I want to talk about it sometimes, but not on television. Tv has this thing about twisting facts and making it look like something it wasn't. The local news crews were bad enough."
88,Are you going to fuck with him/her more than this AMA?
89,I don’t really have a question but I just wanted to say I believe you and that what she did was absolutely fucked up

93,Is your actual username u/[deleted] ?
94,"I just checked your comment history and you AREN'T full of shit!! Can I just say I, a random stranger, am super proud of you, and should be a role model for anyone you meet. I couldn't think of a question.. so opinion on new Reddit?"
95,I suggest writing the username in random places around campus in the hopes he will see one and be thoroughly freaked the fuck out
96,Username checks out
97,"Does the cancer patient wonder how his tumour is doing once it's been removed?

Cut that silly bitch out of your life completely man.
If your friends bring it up, let it pass you by.

Take solace that it happened while she was a GF and not a wife.

It hurts dude, I know: a previous girlfriend of mine split with me after 7 years because 'she felt like we were gonna break up sooner or later'.
She then married someone else six months later.

It sucks in the moment bruh, but it gets better."
98,"This is actually really cool, lol. 

Favorite alcoholic drink?"
99,"aw, the account has been deleted."
100,How’s his Reddit porn preference? Lol
101,[deleted]
102,"Do you still talk to her?  

Is she mentally ill?"
103,"It may have happened 15 years ago, but the problems you're having with it are happening right now. It may be worth a call, just to talk to a neutral, supportive party."
104,Uh I dont really have a question that hasnt been asked before... but good job man. Seriously that's awesome.
105,"Really? Everything I've seen has been to the opposite of that. It seems like a very supportive place, especially for victims of sexual violence. Male or female. 

Edit: I'm looking through the comments here and seeing what you don't see on a sub - what didn't get past the mods. As with most subs, it seems the mods there do want to cultivate a narrative. I'm sorry some of you had legitimate posts that got removed, and I'll be more sceptical of the scope of content there. 
I still think it's a generally supportive place for most victims. "
106,"I quit porn about 2 years ago. I was spending all of my time during sex thinking about porn, mentally playing my favorite clips in my head, rather than focusing on the woman in front of me. Once I stopped watching it, those thoughts went away, and I could focus on her more.

That said, there's plenty of amateur porn out there where it's very clear that filming and uploading it is something both parties are interested in. I admit that's a small fraction of the porn out there, but if someone is interested in watching porn but doesn't want to watch abusive or exploitative porn, there are options"
107,We'll be on a 24ft rowing boat with a cabin at each end and the rowing positions in the middle
108,"Thanks @darellc, we've seen a few scary stories too - The Mercy was really relevant. 
I attempted this row in June this year and it didn't go to plan... but that's because our skipper quit. We'd managed to get through 20ft waves and 40 knot winds before that, so I'm confident we have experience in the boat which helps us be prepared.

There's always a risk that we might not come back. I've seen my friends complete the row and spoken to them about the challenges they had on board, provided we don't do anything silly then the risk is quite low, lower than you'd expect. Only 8 people have ever died from ocean rowing which is quite amazing, and those were all from not being attached to the boat.

It is of course a dangerous undertaking and we know the risks. We're just thankful to have experienced people around us to advise before we go and really supportive families"
109,I can't believe you've done this.
110,"Thats another person, im op. I find it pretty funny how easy it would be to impersonate another deleted user like this"
111,Fuck. We should have multiple? Rip.
112,"Yo how are you doing OP? I got questions, but you doing okay? "
113,How big is the boat?
114,Thank you. I deleted the post however for personal safety because the topic was getting controversial.
115,I probably broke a rule posting this
116,"I mean, I worked any time someone offered. If they are traveling they probably don't care about school, but talking to them will go a long way. Just start a regular conversation and make them feel like they are humans, not trash. Most kids I knew ran away because we felt like we were after thoughts, and when someone talked to me, and showed interest in who I was, that went a long way. "
117,"I was referred to twoX a few months ago after posting (on a throwaway) on a non-gendered support subreddit, and I posted the same story there asking for their perspective. (Short version: my female therapist said I deserved to be raped by my first grade teacher.)

I unintentionally omitted my gender from the twoX OP, and at the mods insistence I edited the post. The replies shifted almost entirely to defending the therapist, half an hour later I was banned from both subreddits for ""trolling"", my posts were removed from both subreddits (by the same mod on both subreddits), and the account received a shadowban.

I was just looking for advice on how to convince my therapist that her remarks were improper, but they decided that my six-year-old self was a suitable target for retaliation."

121,"I'm doing well now, thanks for asking. I also go to therapy now so that helps loads."
122,"This really troubled me, so I asked Porn about it.
""Porn, you said once I decided to follow you,
You'd walk with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,
there was only one set of footprints.
I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""

Porn whispered, ""My precious child, I love you and will never leave you
Never, ever, during your trials and testings.
When you saw only one set of footprints,
It was then that I carried you."""

125,"I thought i did in the past before this happened. Now the only murderous urge i get is towards my mom. I love her, but i also hate her with all my being and wish she got the death penalty. "
126,"There was a time when i was a kid and i remember i would say, super excited, almost presuming, that she was a prostitute, my mom had to tell the teachers that she was a (i don't remember, but something that sounded almost like prostitue), now i just don't tell them (also, rarely i have to tell it to anyone), i think just my close friends and family know."
127,"$20 can lead to anything, even $20 dollars."
128,"I'm sorry that the trolls are rolling into your thread, OP. just remember they have sad little lives and too much time on their hands."
129,Others Asked why and you said you felt guilty all the time. My question is why? What made you feel guilty? 
130,"you'll feel that way for a while, DO NOT TAKE HER BACK. if you do she will just continue to use you and cheat. "
131,"Hey, spellingbotwithtumor, just a quick heads-up:  
**recieve** is actually spelled **receive**. You can remember it by **e before i**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
132,"Unhappy with my life, felt guilty all the time"
133,"Bullshit, a dude posted a similar story last week and it was filled with positive responses "
134,Has science gone to far?!?
135,"I'm female and I absolutely believe you. I've known 2 women in my life that used this tactic (get them drunk) and rape them while they were unconscious/incapacitated to make the guys 'like' them. 

Bitch, they don't like you because you are a cunt.

But its not rape because they are guys! You can't rape a guy!

YES THIS IS RAPE. YES YOU CAN RAPE A MAN. Consent goes both ways.

FWIW, I'm in my late 50s. I grew up in the era of we were to expect it, if we were raped it was partially our fault. If we passed out drunk it was 100% our fault because we didn't say no. Never mind we couldn't say yes either. 

I'm glad the times are changing. Awareness is rising. Consent is key, male and female. 

"
136,"i know for sure that some friends of mine have done it, but they asked me first about it, my mom told the first one she couldn't do it with him because of my relationship with them, then she told me they wanted to be her clients, i told her that they had asked me first about it, after like two weeks later she asked me if i was still ok, i told her i was.

My mom doesn't enter in details, but after that she asks me if someone i know wants to be her client and also she asks me if i'm ok with it, if i'm, then that's the only information i recieve, they usually tell me before all of that what they want to do, and they don't bully me/presume me, etc."
137,That could be a lot of fun but could get ugly really quick. 
138,Angriest gambler you’ve ever seen and why was he so angry?
139,First time I’ve read “that’s all I’ll say about me” in an AMA. 
140,"Holy crap I think im almost done with one too!!! I let my gf hold it because for me its either washer, lose it, or it melts in my car. One time I was about 75% done and it got stuck on the cap, i scooped it out, heated it up and tried to freeze it together out of desperation that I would finally finish my first tube. My girlfriend picked it up and just threw it away. WOMAN WONT UNDERSTAND!!!!"
141,can you please make a post asking for advice on how to safeguard information? 
142,"ive see it, i laughed a little"
143,"Glad you're ok, knew a friend that blacked out drinking and a girl that had herpes on her mouth gave him a blowjob, bam instant herpes. "
144,"It's a double standard on top of an already existing horror. I'm so fucking sorry that happened to you. In college, I walked in on a friend being raped at a frat party—3 other guys standing around the bed waiting their turns (or had already done so, whatever). She was drunk, out cold, didn't even know it was happening. She wasn't believed, ended up dropping out. I know several girls/1 guy who weren't believed. RAGE. I'm so sorry."
145,"My boyfriend stopped watching porn last year and he is much better in bed now. Foreplay, sex everything comes easy now. No struggle. I thought we are not compatible but it was all his porn addiction."
146,"i dont think ill be around when he finds out

147,"Sorry, **BurnbagG**, but you can not give **50 points** to **Gryffindor**.

169,Wtf are you talking about? That subreddit is incredibly responsive to victims of sexual assault. 
170,"other than my close cousins, a lot of my extended family never cared for me anyway, due to my mother. She has always been the black sheep of the family. She is the family drunk who no one cared for much and unfortunately i am her spawn.. I don't feel like they hate me any extra now, but i can feel their stares and judgement. They've never actually said anything to me about it though."
