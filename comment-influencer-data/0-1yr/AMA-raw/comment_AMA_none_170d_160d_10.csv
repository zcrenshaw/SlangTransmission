2,What age is the youngest person you know
3,Do you ever stand to poop to balance it out?
4,"Hey same. Sitting down is more comfortable and let’s you use your phone while using the bathroom. Plus standing up sometimes leads to peeing a little on the seat, which is gross to clean up
Amirite"
5,2 months 
6,Up until recently the hardest thing was being around people who expected me to know how to take care of myself as soon as I got out. I got locked up for a year when I was 17 then 19 for 24. All together 17 years in seg. So mentally I'm like a teenager in some ways. I never did anything for myself before. I hadn't even closed a door in 24 years. (I'm always leaving the fridge open and walking away haha) I don't understand how my friends and family expected me to know how to pay bills or how to download apps on my phone. I had no idea what YouTube was or anything like that. Now life is way easier with her in the picture. She teaches me new things every day. If it weren't for her I'd be back in prison for sure. 
7,What's the best Christmas gift you've ever been given?
8,"I became a janitor because after I graduated I was going nowhere in life, and a childhood adult who was alway in my life was the big boss. 

As far as most interesting conversation; somehow a group of boys didn’t know I was working next to them as they talked about being worried Boy A his girlfriend pregnant. All the while, skipping class smoking weed in the bathroom. 2 hours later, I overhear a group of girls taking about a similar story, out two and two together and figured they were the boyfriend and girlfriend. Turns out girlfriend was using a fake pregnancy to keep the boyfriend from smoking weed.. go figure."
9,"Yes i do and i have no particular reason for that
"
10,An iphone 7
11,What is $2+$3 equal to?
12,Do you like black girls and why
13,What's your favorite animal?

21,well theyre necessary for our well being.
22,What is the most Karma you have ever gotten from 1 comment or post?
23,How often do you eat cereal?
24,Initially I was arrested for forging a few checks and stealing cars. I was in the state jail waiting to be sentenced when I saw a hole in the fence. Two guys jumped out and I saw the bar across the street and thought 'fuck this place'. I was on the run for 3 hours. I was a fool back then. 
25,"Most mornings

29,does potato count? if it doesnt then beetroot
30,9
31,This man understands
32,What is your favourite root vegetable?
33,"That's a tricky one. Most noteworthy events are pretty funny. Only one story sticks out in my mind right now:

A pool cleaner was using a machine to clean the floor around the edge of the pool, he lost control of it and the main body of the machine fell over the ledge. He and three others were trying to pull it back up by the handle but it was too far gone. It sunk to the bottom of the pool and could be seen still driving itself around trying to clean the pool floor. It's not as funny in a retelling, but everyone in the control room was pissing themselves laughing."
34,Eyyyy! Well done! I’m 30 and I got to feel boob for the first time a few months ago. It’s nice to slowly catch up after a decade of feeling behind.
35,does my butt look big in these pants?
36,"I’m 21 but look 17. The school I work at has very relaxed dress code, so it’s leads to interesting situations with students and teachers thinking that I’m actually a student."
37,What makes you decide to stand that extra 10% of the time?
38,So which is it?  Feeling boob or behind??  Something doesn’t add up. 
39,Ayyy my dude! I was raised by lesbians too! But my mom count is up to four now
40,What's been the hardest thing about being back in the real world?
41,*insert disturbed tom meme*
42,Why?
43,Ha! Joke's on... huh... joke's on *someone...*
44,It's still so confusing. Luckily I started dating someone who has taken the time to show me the way. Most people just wanted to do everything for me cus it was easier.  I just learned how to use an air fryer and turn on a treadmil as a matter of fact. Up until 5 months ago I couldn't even reverse the camera on my phone. I don't think I'll ever learn to use a computer though. I don't like it. Too many boxes. 
45,"“ yes Kathy, that’s mayonnaise “

There’s a large amount of jerking off that goes on in this school. Needless to say, it’s never a dull moment at work."
46,With old people it's a little shocked for a sec but with people like 25 and younger its nothing for them
47,"Hey this is the girlfriend writing! I think it's easier for me to answer the mental health thing. He has never been evaluated since being out. Nor has he researched anything. He shows so many signs of PIS (Post-Incarceration Syndrome)  Anger for no reason over small things he doesn't understand (he usually just sits in silence with a confused mad look.  No violence thank God), he used to drink non stop up until a few months ago. He has paralyzing anxiety when we go out. He can't look people in the eye for very long. I order for him at restaurants cus it causes him so much stress.
He has come a long way in a few months. His irrational fears, like me leaving him while he's at work even though we aren't mad at each other, are starting to go away. He stopped giving me his debit card and cell phone when we go to parole since he always thought he'd be arrested for absolutely nothing. At first I almost left him but he just needed someone to help him and guide him. We were pen pals in prison but only friends so I moved to help him with his life and ended up falling in love. He just wants to be loved like everyone else. His coworkers are ex cons and act very similar.

Oh he read lots and lots of books. He had a radio. He made money by betting on sports teams. He said he almost always won. We're gonna have to sign up for fan duel soon so we can make some money. Haha "
48,Congrats dude! 
49,Do you believe mass surveillance has gone too far?
50,"that they mean the world to me and they are worth living for

51,IM SUFFERING.lol
52,Started from the bottom now were here 
53,Please don't have kids. 
54,idk lol ask your mom
55,"Never really seen anything ""tear pulling"", but there are a few contenders that have made me wince.

1. A man's relative had passed away that day. He chugged a bottle of vodka in the bathroom and then attempted suicide by jumping from heights. Security at the site pinned him to the ground until the police department arrived.
2. Construction worker fell onto a sheet of glass he was carrying and sliced his wrist open. Severed an artery, lost a lot of blood very quickly.
3. Drugged up man beat up a \~16yo kid, without provocation, to within an inch of his life."
56,Have you ghostwritten songs for artists who publicly claim not to use ghostwriters 
57,What would be the nicest thing you would say to someone?
58,Thanks man. Yeah I mean I miss a few guys that are still in there in seg. I should write them but it's hard. I work sometimes 12 hour days and to try and get myself to sit down and write a letter is hard. I did that for so long ya know? I don't have to write letters out here. 
59,This is my favorite AMA in months
60,he can suck my non exsistant dick.
61,has anybody ever made a funny face specifically at the camera just for shits n giggles
62,"Hey, still relatable even after the edit."
63,brb gonna kill myself
64,What is the most interesting conversation you’ve overheard? 
65,"i push it in and pierce the hole.
"
66,Undoubtedly.
67,I am 45. I made parole I guess. I have to report until 2034. Hopefully I can get off sooner though. 
68,"Passers by started gathering, some of the residents of that building also came out , basically whomever heard it ( I didn’t as I had my headphones on)"
69,Describe the odor from betwixt your butt cheeks.
70,"Good, we're getting better "
71,"I never worked a night night because I have college classes, but there has been times early morning 4:30-5 am where I know for a fact I’d lock a certain door. And coming back through it would be unlocked or open. Being the only person on campus at the time, it’s very very creepy."
72,He spent a decade of exclusively feeling up behinds. Now he’s moving up to boobs. 
73,"By far, last summer. During some football workouts, a player over ate. There was a trail of puke and poop leading from the practice field all the way to the locker room, and the bathroom it’s self. I don’t understand how people can go days without using the bathroom, but let me tell you, it builds up.

Took me maybe an hour tops to clean it all up.
"
74,James McAvoy
75,"I was really just sick of all the bullshit you see on there, i was also sick of just that feeling of 'shit i better check Facebook and see whats going on' then that leads to mindless scrolling of the newsfeed just looking at stuff you dont care about, i feel like i lose braincells going on Facebook 😂 i know that comes down to what pages you follow and who you are friends with etc.. but yeah its just not my cup of tea, i really only go on there for the memes

And i also find its better use of time going on reddit, i feel like a learn alot and i have alot of good laughs at stuff on here

"
76,"Do you get stuck in a ""ask your mom"" loop?"
77,what do you think of donald trump?
78,How do you put a straw in a capri sun?
79,why were you arrested?
80,"you go boy. take it all in you hot motherfucker. Life. Love. Enjoy the feeling of awareness and wokeness flowing through your veins. Humanity at its core is meant to be experienced sober... alive... crisp... sharp... detailed... vivid... passionate...

You rock bitch. *(Note: I'm about 11 months no alcohol myself now, so not the same experience as you, just wanted to share my perspective, trying to tell myself the truth.)*"
81,The haven’t made the edit yet but oh no
82,How old are you?
83,BLOOD
84,"It bothered me at first. I was right out of high school when I started and obviously had an ego. Growing up you become more mature and realize a job is a job. Money is money. A lot of the kids relate to me because I’m young so they arnt as harsh. I’m a supervisor now and it’s sad seeing how they treat the older custodians.

In the end, it’s like the casual job title is janitor, the professional job title is custodian."
85,I was on the second story of the jail in the rec yard and there were no guards out there. I watched two guys slip out through a hole in the bottom of the fence and jumped off the building. So I was thinking for a second about the bar across the street and how  I'd love to have a beer. I also knew there was a pay phone right by the jail so I thought I'd call my buddy to come get me.  But as soon as I got out I just took off like a bat out if hell. Three hours later the dogs found me. They shoved my face right into an ant hill. When I saw the Warden he was talking shit so I told him to go fuck himself. He punched me right it the throat. It sure shut me up quick let me tell you. 
86,Favorite actor ? 
87,Describe the worst type of person 
88,"I agree, I always get awkward stares peeing sitting down on a urinal. "

91,How do people react if you tell them you have two moms? 
92,hitler uwu
93,They can do whatever they want to you. Especially back then. I watched my cellie get murdered the first day I went to prison. Guts spilling out as he looked up at me. The guards took me and had me standing outside in the freezing cold for hours in just boxers. Kept me in solitary for two weeks trying to get me to snitch. When they finally gave up they sent me back to the wing where the murderers were. I was just a scrawny little kid too. Thank God they never came after me. The guards don't protect you. The more we fight with each other the better. If we all got together and fought the guards nobody could do a damn thing. They are told to provoke us. It keeps the attention off of them. Oh and I found out later that dude was killed over some shower shoes. 
94,"bake them ig . sorry ive never made them
"
95,"All the time.

I've seen more than a few people shit themselves in public. Thankfully it's not a common occurrence."
96,"Perhaps.

97,I replied in more detail in a different comment. I was a dumb dumb. 
98,Do you use Reddit?

102,Whats your favorite color?
103,I'm really glad you found someone that's been helping you out. I wish you the best of luck &amp; hope you enjoy your new life 
104,a week ago.

106,"happiness, hatred, calmness"
107,Who was the German leader in WW2?
108,"What's the meaning of life, universe, and everything?"
109,"You're gonna laugh and probably not the answer that you're looking for but right when I got out, my old girlfriend from high school picked me up at the bus station. I had never seen a smart phone and honestly didn't give a fuck about using one. Then she showed me how there's porn for FREE everywhere. My mouth dropped to the floor boards. Man... I think I've seen every kind of porn there is within that first month of me getting out. Even things I didn't wanna see just because I was so blown away by it being right there instantly for free. Before I got locked up we had VHS tapes and had to be all discreet about it. It was a big deal just to get one. Haha. Also I started getting all of these strange messages saying they were girls in my area that wanted to sleep with me. I guess I was clicking on all these links that knew my email. Everyone still laughs at me for that. But it blew my mind. "
110,Asking the real questions.
111,"a person who is rude, puts down other people and also has psychopathic tendencies."
112,What's the funniest thing you've seen on cctv?
113,YES!
114,Do you like to go to the beach
115,Know any inside jokes?
116,What are your favourite emotions?
117,"Maybe I'm biased, but no. In fact I don't think it has gone far enough. So many more crimes can be solved quickly and with ease if only there were more surveillance devices around.

I understand the arguments about not wanting to be stalked by a corporation and ""invasion of privacy"" and such, but honestly the average law abiding citizen has nothing to fear -in fact Joe Farmer should feel safer knowing that if anything happens to his truck while he's out and about, there is recorded evidence that will bring the perpetrator to justice."
118,How do you prepare pizza rolls?
119,"So I was in the jail when they were deciding the length of my sentence when I escaped but I was probably only get 5 to 7 years. If I had know they were gonna give me 40 fucking years for it I would have never jumped off the roof of the jail and ran. 

I'd listen to my radio and read books. For a few years I'd just sit and stare at the wall not thinking about anything. Every once in a while I'd get a letter. Sometimes I'd help pass out commissary and contraband with my line. My cell had a big ass hole in it so I'd get some shit from the mexicans when I threw it to their buddies down the way. Talk to some dudes through the wall. My cell was only 9 by 5 feet. I gave up on working out after a few years in seg. "
120,What is the most emotional/tear pulling moment you have witnessed?
121,How are you dealing with all this new technology? 
122,IM A MONSTER. 
123,Hey I managed to survive so it's okay. It all led me to the girl of my dreams so it was worth it to me. She hates when I say that but I'd do it all over again. I've never been so happy in my entire life. 
124,idk how to feel about this ama lol. i simultaneously love and hate it haha.
125,"urinal access too I assume?

&amp;#x200B;"
126,Do you mean cooties?
127,"Good for you! I’ve never had a Facebook account, thought I do use other social media’s. 

What was the last straw when it came you to deleting your account?"
128,"Not quite. Cameras themselves are an effective deterrent for ***most*** would-be criminals. 

For the rest of them, effective communication between a manned control room and the boots on the ground (security and/or police) has proven results in preventing crime before it happens, apprehending offenders when crime does happen, and providing immediate assistance to any other tragedy."
129,Ouch....
130,Mom and momma
131,"Nope, they’re those damn [lifesavers](https://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/solo3-wireless) "
132,That's awesome man I would share a picture if I was will to show my face online but I only do it my snap

135,What is your age? How'd you get out early?

137,just put it in rice after
138,Keep it up. i deleted mine 4 years ago.
139,Awe thank you! I actually was really struggling with finding myself when I started helping him. He has completely changed me as a person. I am so loving and understanding and constantly trying to better myself. It was a win win really. Him and I were never supposed to meet. I only wrote him as a friend thinking he was never getting out of prison. Lol funny how things work out. 
140,It was amazing!
141,Are you a pirate? 
142,"Alternatively acceptable answer: ""Hell yes, thank God"""
143,"I think that ""someone"" is YouTube. "
144,no comments.
145,"I meant your holes, your orifices."
146,"Congrats on 11 months. Imo alcohol is significantly harder to get off of than cocaine (I still drink, but not to excess)

It's funny you described it that way because now that I'm clean the world feels more vibrant and colorful. I hear more sounds that I would have otherwise missed, and found interest in things I would have blown off while high. "
147,Yeah it's fucked up. My cell was 9 feet by 5. Just to be clear I was in seg for 3 years and then later for 14. More people should be protesting the way they treat us. It's like we're animals. I've seen them put a rich young kid who got arrested for selling a bit of weed into a cell with a murderer who was three times his size and not his race. The boy was missing for three fucking days. The big dude was fucking his dead body under the bed the entire time. Man that caused some crazy shit to go down. I ended up getting transferred just cus I was in that wing and I was the same race as the kid. 
148,"Had the same thing. 

I was 18 when i worked as a janitor (uni has different vacations than highschool over here, worked there a month in the summer between coming from HS and going to uni).

Ranged from students hitting on me, thinking i was some kind of shy/anti-social new kid. To teachers being utter assholes and me being able to put them on their place.

Knew a lot of guys that were actually still going to school there, so it was a lot of fun."
149,You should go on r/drunk and ask everyone to celebrate for you.
150,Yes sometimes
151,Hell yeah. I was in a 9 by 5 cell 23 hours a day. I could touch both walls without even stretching my arms all the way out. They didn't put me in seg until years later.  These dudes escaped and killed a bunch of prison guards. A few weeks later I was in the wrong wing of the prison cus this dude owed me money. I was waiting outside of his cell and a new guard realized I was in the wrong wing. I wouldn't tell them why I was over there. I actually have two escape charges cus I slipped out of a cop car while he was in the store. So they saw the two escape charges and they put me in seg for a year. I just figured it would only be a year.  Every year after that they denied me to go back to population. They said I was too high of a risk. One time the guy actually approved me to go back. I was all ready and going that day and then they got a phone call saying I was denied again. That really fucked me up. 
152,Okay to break it down my mom was going to carry us cuase she is 5 years younger but was unfortunately unable to. So then my momma carried us and ofc gave birth to us. My sperm donor is different from my sisters 
153,Seen anything happen to someone that would be really embarrassing if they knew you saw it?
154,Ever seen people have sex?
155,"Ha! No. Usually just browse Facebook/Reddit/Youtube/Ebay on my phone while glancing up at the monitors every couple minutes. If something is happening, it's usually the boots on the ground who alert us, and we just get a visual on the situation and track back to get some additional context. Otherwise it's pretty easy to spot when something is out of place.

I do try to do a full detailed sweep every 10-30 minutes depending on risk factors."
156,Any paranormal stories
157,"How do you feel about being referred to as a janitor? I remember in high school, they lectured us about how that’s rude and we should call them custodians or “custodial engineers.”"
158,Worst thing u had to clean?
159,ohhhh
160,I like this one 
161,"I was a janitor at a Catholic elementary school for a while, and worked overnights, often alone. I'm a skeptic and an atheist to my core but I'll be damned if the spookiest place in the world ain't a big empty school at 3:00 in the morning."
162,She said it smells like surround sound. How do you make sound smell?
163,Wow it’s incredible what you’ve done for him. Thank you for your reply. You’re a really good person for everything you’ve done for him
164,Oh goodness 
165,"I dont think it is different at all my moms love me like a mom and dad should.



Ah dont have to spend money on father's day.



I dont miss anything.

166,Speaking on what really blatters.
167,"Most of the control rooms I've worked record in excess of 3 months worth of footage from hundreds of cameras operating 24/7/365. It is impossible to manually delete anything that has been recorded within that rewind period.

Report-worthy events are put on an ""evidence lock"", and are permanently saved, bookmarked, and accessible even after the rewind period. Crimes are also saved to physical media and handed over to police."
168,"Hey girlfriend here! I sort of had him trying the voice to text recently. The only problem is that he has a super southern accent. Google can't understand him. Haha Actually when we were pen pals I used to send him letters doing that. Feels like so long ago! If the letter is gonna get written it will be because I organized it all. (Set up the account, searched for the inmate, wrote out what he wants to say)  I will put that on my to do list now. Thanks :)"
169,Shit that's too low 
170,"How did solitary confinement effect your mental health, and what did you do in there to pass time? More so, how is it being around people after spending so long in solitary confinement?"
171,"Without being too specific , is this at a shopping plaza ? Casino ? What type of enviorment are these cameras that you watch ?"
172,Honestly keep your opinion to yourself we dont care if we are against the bible.
173,"Oh no that was actually really funny imagining it, I laughed here myself reading it. Definitely wish I had seen it myself though, what a shame. 

How often do you guys keep recordings of things? is it only when a crime takes place? Or do you normally delete stuff if there is no reason to keep it."
174,LMAO this is way more than I expected 
175,Would you rather pee on 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck size horses?
176,what do you call your moms? (ex. mum and mom)
177,"They did leave every now and then, but not often. When they left they just let me lounge around and do whatever. I wasn't allowed to leave the house though."
178,that is beyond my thoughts.
179,Has it ever worked?
180,"That doesn’t make you bad,  I would let that man do all sorts of naughty things to me."

187,Girlfriend here! Yes I've seen that. He won't watch tv or videos. I read that that is a symptom of Post-Incarceration Syndrome but I will check it out. I was thinking of trying to make us a channel. I may write a channel to interview us and maybe we could get paid? That would be nice. I'm surprised no one has contacted him to run tests on him since it's not very common and the damage it causes. I did just read that 60% of people released from prison go back to  within their first year. Not him! Yay!
188,I have two moms and two dads. The moms are together and the dads are together. My mom and dad were together when I was young and then I guess both realized they were gay?
189,I never got bullied just kids asked a lot of questions I'm also in Canada where I feel it's way more accepted. 
190,"I shared this with someone earlier. 


There is a triple risk model that most researchers believe in. It involves these three happening at once. (1) a vulnerable infant, (2) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control, and (3) an exogenous stressor(s).
A vulnerable infant would be considered one born early, or one born with the brain defect that 30% of babies who die of SIDS have. A critical development period is self explanatory, but most of those happen within the first 6 months they are what people call the “leaps.” And exogenous stressors could be the baby becoming overheated, a major change that has caused stress, chin to chest position, soft sleeping surface, a cold, a respiratory infection, etc. 

If all of those things combine, they hypothesize that this sis what causes it. 

My son was born 3 weeks early, but weighed 7 lbs 11 oz. He was incredibly healthy. Ate like a champ. Slept all night. Was never sick. And weighed 15 pounds and was 24 inches long when he passed. We had no idea. Which is why it was so shocking. It was the last thing I ever thought about. He just started daycare two days prior and it made him very tired. But other than that he was perfectly normal and had a perfectly normal night with us before we went to sleep. 

I have as 7 1/2 month old now and she is totally fine. We did everything exactly the same with her. 

When people say unsafe sleep is what causes SIDS that’s a lie. It’s a contributing factor, but for most infants it doesn’t matter. I’ve met moms of SIDS babies whose babies were wide awake when it happened and just stopped breathing. No sense of panic. Nothing. They just stopped breathing. Some were able to be revived, but could never be taken off life support and sustain life. It’s a horrible thing that people don’t know a lot about. 

I have anxiety and I refused to read about it when we got pregnant because I didn’t want to be scared. I said it would never happen anyway. And then it did. So I knew nothing before hand. I thought I was protecting us by not allowing my anxiety to steal happiness away. "
191,"You’re putting a lot of pressure on this relationship that is still very new. 

If you lose it you’re going to lose everything. "
192,"OP is 13, so it's before he was born"
193,Wouldn't that make it cry more?
194,"Best part? I actually did enjoy the sexual component. I had never had anal sex before this, so it was mostly a pleasurable experience (even if I was tied up during it).

Worst part was probably having to be completely naked for 24 hours. I'm a self conscious person, so it took some getting used to. Also being used as a foot stool. At my age that hurt like hell."

200,That's what my girlfriend wants to do. I don't know how I could possibly help cus I can't even file my own taxes haha. She is gonna do something to help people like me I'm sure. 
201,"Yep, I’ve actually been meeting my half siblings here lately and I think we have found my donor, it’s a dude living in Austin Texas. My siblings found him through 23 and me"

210,"Just wanna say thank you, cleaning up after people all the time seems rough. At my high school we had an awards assembly and the only person who people clapped for (standing ovation actually) was the janitor who had been there 20 years.

Also whats your favorite part of the job? And your least favorite "
211,"Do you know, and are you willing to disclose the biological relation to either of your mothers and or your sister?

In just curious because it seems like there's so many options, one moms egg, the other moms uterus, do the opposite for your sister. Adoption, all donors, etc.

Also, do you know anything about your biological father or if he is also your sister's?

I know that's really invasive, I'm just super curious. "
212,I wonder what is the initial question? 
213,I deleted my Facebook about a year ago after I saw certain friends of mine creating their own personal echo chambers and literally ending real-life friendships as a result.  
214,"My favorite part: is getting helped from students. Many times I will be pulling a trash bag and a kid will run over and just hold the lid for me. Little things like that go along way in your day. 

Least favorite part: puke on carpets. We can clean anything without a machine but if it involves puking on a carpet we have to go across campus and get our very heavy machine. It’s more of an annoyance, I really do love my job."
215,"Just continue to be the person that you have been. You can throw subtle hints out that they may be having a problem (that's what it took for me to finally realize I needed to change) or just sit down and have a casual talk about it. 

Whatever you do DO NOT corner them and have a intervention type confrontation. They do not work and will more than likely end up with the end of that friendshio.

One big thing is the person has to want to get clean. The best thing you can do as a friend is convince them that they want to be clean, not force them to do it.

Keep in mind everyone is different and my advice is based purely off my experiences. Different people and different drugs have different addictions. "
216,"Does each mother get a specific one? Like mom 1 is mom, and mom 2 is momma?"
