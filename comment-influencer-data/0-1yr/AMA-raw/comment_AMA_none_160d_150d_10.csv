0,"To be honest, I was initially trying to cope with the loss of my father. He raised me alone following the death of my mother when I was 9, and he lived with us for the last 17 years of his life. He was a remarkable influence in the lives of my three sons. He woke every morning before dawn to make fresh, homemade bread so the kids always left the house with a lunch made with fresh bread. He set alarms on his phone to make sure he was waiting at the front door when they each got off the bus. If they had a new favorite superhero, by the time they got ready for bed that evening they had new PJs, made by their Papa. Unfortunately the business and financial damage was so non-stop that I had little time to really deal with the loss. It was like living in a blur that you just cannot describe. But to answer your question...yup. Lots and lots of The Office. Thanks, Michael Scott!"
1,"Dude...when I found out my father did the same thing 19 years ago I did exactly what you did! I went to my homies place, smoked some weed and had a pizza beat me home and watched a movie. Wow...is like some kind of standard coping mechanism?!"
2,"I went to a movie, I’m currently picking up some pot, and I ordered a pizza to beat me home."
3,Half the population wipe standing up. And the other half wipe sitting down. We usually dont know the other exists.
4,A strange way to cope. My condolences. What do you plan to do afterwards?
5,"I’m going to return to therapy. I stopped going for financial reasons a few weeks back, but now it seems more important than ever."
6,"Because of you, a couple who cant have children will get their chance at being parents. You’ve done the world a great service."
7,Please keep hydrated.
8,"An ADVENTURER, huh? What sort of credentials would--

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Hello everyone, I'm Thor from Denmark  


I'm sold. "
9,I was adopted as well. My mom always told me I had two sets of parent who love me because my birth mom loved me so much she wanted to give me to a family that would give me better life than she could at that time. Never meet my birth mom but I’ve always been so grateful for her
10,I cant give her a good enough life. Her father left when I got pregnant. I'd always be working and she wouldn't be the best provided for so I wanted her to go to a better family. I grew up very poor and don't want her to.
11,What *were* you able to do during your 15 months of being dead? Like did you watch Netflix all day every day or something?
12,"My parents weren't exactly the greatest. I was removed from them at 14 by CPS and treated for PTSD. 

Selective eating disorder is a type of anxiety disorder than can stem from things like PTSD. "
13,"They all were unexpected. I've had like, 5 that were old and sickly. The most impactful ones were my mom shot herself, my uncle set himself on fire, my 1st husband in a car accident, my 2nd (just this past Oct) from a relapse overdose, we were married 8yrs and about 3yrs ago after a few surgeries back to back, he was addicted and it progressed badly, he had 6mos clean and his relapse killed him, my brother in law was an overdose, my niece died shortly after birth, my 2 cousins from car accidents...

Yeah, I'd say I have become desensitized, almost like it doesnt shock me at all anymore, and it's just another funeral to go to, just another life lost, like, it definitely hurts like indescribably but the actual process has very little shock to it anymore."
14,I wanted her to have an education since I don't and just for them to love her.
15,"Nope! Sugar is normal, blood pressure is perfect, cholesterol is fine. My skin is normal, but my teeth are probably more yellow than they should be. I workout 3 times a week and keeping weight off is difficult but I'd consider myself ""fit"" "
16,"I am 18. It's an open adoption, so yes. Are you happy you were adopted?"
17,I’m sure he’d be proud of you 
18,"Montana. What I dreamed mountains to be! 
"
19,I am sorry to hear that. Will you be seeking any help? Whatever choice you make I hope you don't hope hurt yourself or anyone else.
20,"Police found him. My dad loves nature, he drove out to a park this morning and shot himself in the head. Not sure how much of a mess there was,  but I imagine it wasn’t pretty. Don’t know who found him, I’ll update this when I get a copy of the police report. "
21,"Wow, my condolences to you, did you ever get used to all the grieving and stuff, apart from suicide how else did they pass away, did anyone have a completely unexpected passing."
22,Will your groomsman and maid of honour be the couple that got married?? 
23,How old are you? Are you able to have any contact with her? I was adopted at birth.
24,Thanks. I got to hold her and I miss her so much. I dont have anyone or anything to go home to. Her parents are great though I think she'll have a good life.
25,Do you have any diet related health issues? Is your skin yellow? I’ve heard people turn the color of food they eat or something like that and was always curious! 
26,I’m actually a convert. Used to stand until I was shown the light.
27,"We must stand together, my brother. "
28,Your parents let you eat exclusively Mac and cheese at 3 years old? 
29,Theyre both too full of the wrong sugars. Go to a drugstore (or get someone to go for you) and get some Hydralyte or equivalent. The 'Ades' may actually be making you feel worse than you need to.
30,"Thank you. He was a very special man. Side story: I once emailed him to ask for advice on a business matter. I rambled for pages, giving him every last detail of the situation. His response gives me chills to this day. I received an email back that simply said...

""Teach. Always teach. If you must, use words.""

I miss that man more than words can convey."
31,"Sorry in advance if it's insesitive.

Who found him and how?
Was there a lot of damage?
Where did he do it?"
32,"Oh, was that a mess! I have banked with the same local financial institution my entire life. When they were notified, the President of the bank (who is a fishing friend of mine) immediately called my wife to ask what they could do to assist the family. She said ""What are you talking about, he's standing right here. I'll put him on."" It was totally surreal. The speed at which these entities report information to one another is simply scary."
33,Trying! Turns out powerade is no where near as good as gatorade
34,Holy shit poor people really should start eating the rich 
35,"You know, it really wasn't. Turns out when you're only ""paper dead"" you don't get any of the cool perks. I plan on taking up the issue with my maker someday!"
36,Which has been your favorite so far?
37,Intelligent move. 
38,"My dad used to make me breakfast every morning, and he’d always wake me up by gently shaking me and whispering my name. 

I’ll never forget that, my dad was at his core a gentle caring person. "
39,"No, but two dads have."
40,"I will miss him, no matter how bad things were between us (and things got pretty bad) I always treasured my memories of him cooking me breakfast or taking me for a drive and listening to that god Awful Celtic music. I was going to say I’ll always remember his laugh, but I look so much like him and share so many of his mannerisms , I basically am a live recording of his laugh.

Honestly, as far as moving forward, my dad was so scared of failing he never even tried. All his potential went to waste, and now that he’s dead there’s never a chance for redemption in that arena. I’ve lived in a similar way, so scared to fail I often give up before I even start, I’m not going to do that anymore. Or atleast I’ll try not to. 

Also he was so scared of being a burden he never leaned on the people that loved him, but he was never in a good spot to help anyone because he was always in a bad way. I’m going to be a more active participant in my support system, it what’s they are there for.

Rambling, but this is helping. Thanks "
41,"Do you have a support system in place for the next few weeks? You are about to go through a hormone shit storm returning back to a single occupant vessel. Your milk is going to come in - reach out to your local La Leche League for help on how to dry up or pump for relief. You did the right thing, you are an amazing mother."
42,"My budget for food, accommodation, transportation and visas is $20/day. But as an average. Some days I spend $100 if I need a visa while other days I spend nothing if I’m on a ship or being hosted. So about $40,000 by now."
43,"It did, yes. In fact, I'm nearly bankrupt. I was declared deceased just as my company was launching, and was unable to move into our new manufacturing facility because the lender would not allow me to close on the property. I put everything on the line to start the company and had equipment sitting in storage that I had to make payments on. I was unable to drive as I did not have a valid license and was unable to travel all together. I tried to get a job while I rode out the storm, but could not find work as I could not pass even the simplest verifications, always coming back as deceased. I did have to sue, which cost me a fortune in legal fees. Unfortunately, the Fair Credit Reporting Act only covers damages to the consumer, not a business entity owned by the consumer, so the resulting settlement was just about enough to cover my legal costs. I am trying to remain optimistic, but my life savings literally evaporated before my very eyes over the course of 15 months. It's make it or literal break it now, but I refuse to be anything but optimistic. Life gives us hurdles. Character is displayed in overcoming them."
44,Thanks! I think?
45,"Well... my dad beat me, starved me and molested my sister (maybe me too) until I got put in foster care when I was 11. 

Two years ago when he died I payed for his cremation. I don’t know why. I felt bad for him. 

The day he died, I bought a pizza, smoked a bowl and played world of Warcraft. "
46,"I have been told however, that I should probably get some fruits and veggies in my diet by 25, definitely by 30 or i will begin to see awful side effects "
47,"The therapy for PTSD was extremely successful! I'm a really positive person now and even boxed for 3 years! (The PTSD was from physical abuse, and I wasnt able to be around physical conflict for a while) 

However I believe the eating disorder will require a special therapist who has dealt with it before. "
48,"Stunned at first, but I’ve had my breakdown crying moments, especially looking through childhood photographs where we were close still."
49,"I’ve been doing it since I was 19.

Nah, I don’t mind. I don’t do that many events, it pays really well, and the kids are usually shy and/or really sweet.

I’d give myself an 8. I know that’s not modest, but there’s a reason why I get offered very good money to do this."
50,"Also Pedialyte. My micro professor gave me a homemade rehydrating solution... I think it's 1 liter of water, one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. Mix well and drink."
51,Are you prepared to have 90% of the document blacked out?
52,Might be easier to just wait until it is leaked to CNN.
53,"Lots of multi vitamins. 

And no actually. There are some days where I wish for something different and I'll eat a different brand, but it's the only food I am super comfortable eating. "
54,Dude...do people normally wipe sitting down?
55,"I don’t believe anyone who has been to as many countries as I have can answer that. However if I was banned from returning to Denmark then I would pick Iceland as my new home. It’s a great little country which is highly efficient, clean, fun, interesting, remote, modern and beautiful. The most interesting attribute would however be the mentality of Iceland which is far more accepting of new ideas and thinking out of the box. Not many countries can pride themselves in that."
56,";)

I haven’t had the chance to slay any. Although I was once traveling in a taxi on a dirt road in the jungle near the Cameroun/Congo border at 03:00am. 3 men in military uniforms stopped the car to question the driver and me. They were very drunk, armed and hostile. I thought that was it. There were no villages nearby and no people. After about 45 minutes they suddenly let both the driver and I go without any reason. We got out of there as fast as possible."
57,"Happy to hear your wife beat cancer, congrats to her! What made you decide to travel so far in the first place?"
58,At the same time?
59,"In a few cases the kids have asked for me. But it has to be done through the parents.

I started out much lower but now I ask $5k for an event, plus expenses (ie, for a prom, the dress, hair, etc) "
60,"Yes, and if they tell me to get the FIOATA out here, I’ll even have that framed."
61,"I appreciate it, I actually have a close friend who went through a similar situation a few years back, so I don’t think I could hope for a better person to have in my support network.

I really appreciate it though, and I’ll definitely keep you in mind :). Thanks"
62,So sorry for your loss and all the hassle; he sounds like he was a really special guy. I'm glad Michael Scott could be of some comfort :)
63,"Word of mouth. It was never something I planned to do, but a family friend asked me if I’d go to prom with his son a few years ago. I did it, he talked me up to other parents, and it just kind of developed from there."
64,RemindMe! 20 years
65,"I am a birth mother as well! My (now)10yo was placed in an open adoption when I was 16.

This will be the hardest thing you do. So, good job, you did it.

You won't have a day where you don't think of your child. Mother's day will suck. You will be sad and it is SO IMPORTANT that you let yourself be sad/angry/whatever you need.

I didn't process my situation until six destructive years later. 

If you need to chat or have any questions, please dm."
66,"I have no ideas what you’re going through right now, but my mother shot herself years ago.  Do you need to PM anyone?  If so, I’m here. "

"
68,I was serious. Really smart getting back into therapy right now. Good for you. 
69,I completely understand and give you support here. You did what you could. I hope you’re alright.
70,I have never once put that much thought into wiping my ass. 
71,"Ive had this. Man it was terrible. 

Atleast youre not riding it out in the woods like I was, maybe a silver lining? 

It'll pass, god speed."
72,"Did you ask the parents for anything in terms of a promise to raise her? My birth mom specifically asked for me to go to college and have siblings.

It’s a tough decision, but you are so brave, and I hope that little girl will see how much you love her."
73,Yep. Some people have too much money.
74,"Woah sorry about that, do you think you will be able to get over it someday and eat other things? And lessen your PTSD"
75,Ive literally been sitting in the tub for hours. Sitting on the toilet seat was cutting circulation to my legs. Every time I think it might be over and I try to stand the muscles in my abdomen area push out more molten hot lava like it's a diarrhea baby. I keep having to run the tub water to get rid of it which is making me cold. Needless to say this bathtub is getting a severe bleaching when I'm done with it
76,Tonight im making mac and cheese with broccoli and bacon with a combo of sharp and smoked cheddar for dinner. If we were friends irl would you eat that?
77,"Pity for a broken person isn’t exactly the same thing as just feeling bad, but you in that moment became more of a man than he ever was and that’s some real shit. "
78,"&gt;My father, my best friend and lover of 10 years

This garden path sentence was initially alarming."
79,"How do you have enough self control to only use the drugs friday and saturday? As an addict myself, I would find that nearly impossible to do."
80,A lot of times it's parents of shy/insecure kids trying to boost their kid's social confidence by putting a hot girl (or any date at all) on their arm. It sounds kind of sad but in a lot of cases I think it actually works.
81,Have any guys grabbed your butt?
82,"I have no words after reading this to be honest, thankyou for sharing something like this...
How are things now? Are you comfortable with how you look? Has the drug use stopped? Do you see any kind of future? I hope things are better cutey! 

You don't have to answer some of these if you don't want to, just answer what you can"
83,"A bunch of countries. Off the top of my head: Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, Argentina, Dominica, Cuba, Botswana, Mozambique, Algeria, Syria, Yemen, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Myanmar...that’s not a complete list but just what I remember."
84,"I guess I shared because i hope someday to maybe write a book, or start a blog or something, especially with all the rise in young deaths from drugs and suicide, I want to try and help people from my own experiences. So many ppl out there are lost going thru grief, and I've survived it all but losing a child, (which terrifies the fuck out of me btw.) When my string of deaths started, it was Myspace days, so the social networking wasnt as available like now, with online support groups and all that, so I dont want anyone to feel alone like I did back then
 
I do have some support, my big brother is my best friend on this earth, and my 1st husbands sister is my dearest friend, I consider her my real sister by heart. My grandparents have always been an incredible support to me, both of their only children were the suicides, so we all kind of just were in it together, they are 85 now so I am dreading the day I lose them...they are absolutely my biggest rock. So I'm trying. I dont have much bond with those from my husbands families, but like a few ppl from each, but I'd rather less, good people than a pile of lousy people, ya know?"
85,I want to find transparency. The government should be open about who it is investigating and why. Investigations shouldn’t be held in secret once they’re completed otherwise our democracy will rot in the dark.
86,"Yeah I tried going to therapy for it, but the only eating disorder therapist near me had never treated sed before and her response was ""just try broccoli"" 

Like oh thankyou ms therapist why hadn't I thought of just trying it before lol"
87,"She didn’t take the picture, she was one great member of a team of thousands of researchers who mad it happen. As I’m sure she would tell you, she by no means singlehandedly made the image possible. Let’s get multiple reps from different parts of the team for a more insightful AMA."
88,"besides the obvious stress of falsely being declared dead, was it cool as fuck? did you haunt your friends?"
89,"Thank you! 
No real reason; my two best mates and I spun a globe and landed on Russia "
90,Sorry for your loss. No matter the connection I imagine it's quite hard. You might feel it more later. 
91,How do you get the nescsarry nutritions you need? And aren't you tired of Mac and Cheese? 
92,What brought you to put the babe up for adoption?
93,"I don't understand? Doesn't standing up bring the sphincter together making it difficult to infiltrate. Furthermore, don't you run the risk of having fragments of shit dropping into your jocks below?"
94,I think it's because of how high of a priority succeeding at my company is for me. Getting high is fun. Snorting dilaudid is my favorite. Blowing threw a ball of yay and having 4hr sex binges is a blast. But none of that is more important to me than kicking ass at my job.
95,Are you doing ok? Do you plan on having future relationships?
96,Why did you post an AMA and then not hang around to answer the questions?
97,"How long have you been doing it? 

Is it super boring to go to high school events instead of college things? 

Where would you tank yourself 1-10"
98,I'm just taking my share. Y'all need to catch up and do the same.
99,"North Korea. It was far more ordinary, although poor, than I thought. Western media creates such a hype about the country and there are many false rumors. Traveling there and seeing it for myself was an eye opener and quite interesting..."
100,"My budget is $20 USD / day as an average. It was sponsored for the first 30 months, then I depleted my personal funds, then I borrowed money (twice), I ran a crowdfunding campaign and today there’s a Patreon account as well as I earn a little from writing articles. It’s not a lucrative project for me at this point."
101,I want to know louise_louise’s answer to this question too. However I was also adopted and can say I am very happy. I’ve had a fulfilling and abundant life so far. I’m married and have two kids of my own. I’m not in the least bothered by the fact that I was given up. I think mothers who adopt and give their child to adoption have committed the most charitable act imaginable. The whole exchange is the very definition of Christ-like. I wish you love and luck.
102,"Yes, an average speed of 5.4kph (3.38mph) or 11.4 days per country ;)"
103,Crying at this answer. What a selfless act Mama❤️
104,"Montana is one of the most beautiful US states to visit. It looks exactly the same as the postcards, just better.

\*\*If you're ever north of the border, British Colombia/Alberta's section of the Rockies are something to behold. You gave your friend the experience of a lifetime!"
105,How sore is your rusty balloon knot
106,"No question, just wanted to say thanks for doing what you do.

Thank you."
107,"His health was pretty poor and he was reluctant to be a burden on the family. My sister was taking him to the hospital today to get a formal diagnosis, she was trying to take him yesterday but he pushed for 24 hrs to return his cab. That is when I knew my dad was as planning on killing himself, I told my mom I thought so, but he was determined and found a way to get it done. "
108,"I have nothing to ask but just want you to know this is awesome.  What a great tribute to him.

&amp;#x200B;"
109,How much money have to spent so far? 
110,"Biggest thing is making sure you fold the toilet paper. If you got the good stuff, (I like to think I do) break off three squares and fold in half twice. Lean to one side and just press the paper into your asshole and wipe it back. 

I’d advise pulling with the creased end pointed back so the friction doesn’t unfold the paper. That’s how you get shit on your hand or toilet paper stuck up your bum (and then shit in your hand pulling it out)"
111,"""One of"" the worst???"
112,"When you come to Rhode Island DM me ill buy you a beer and show you around a bit, im from Ma. but only like 20 minutes from Providence RI"
113,What are the biggest myths or urban legends about meth?
114,"Wow this is fascinating. If you were to “hide” a veggie in your Mac &amp; cheese, would you not be able to eat it? Cauliflower for example, has a pretty mild flavor that is easily masked by other things. 

Also not to be gross, but how are things in the bathroom? No roughage seems like it would make things awfully sluggish in that department. "
115,"Lol, there are no answers in this AMA. SMH"
116,"Worst. Death. Ever. 

Also, so sorry for the loss of your father, he sounds like he was truly incredible."
117,$$$
118,"I find myself going back to the messages from that day a lot and re-reading them. And the phone call is engraved in my mind. Which i don’t know if It hurts or helps, just something i do. 
But i feel like i shouldn’t miss out on happiness just because of this but It will be hard to get into a new relationship i think. I will always have this in the back of my mind which makes me worry about people in my life constantly now. So to answer your question, i do plan on It. I just don’t know how It will go! "
119,"Nope. But now that you asked....let me sharpen my pencil and add it to my bucket list! I already got screwed, so what's a few more humps!"
120,Have you read The Stranger by Albert Camus?
121,He flushes the wipes
122,That's pretty good for five years! 
123,"I am a CASA (advocate for children in foster care). I saw a woman go against her lawyers advice and give her son over for adoption. The boy is in a wonderful placement and will have a terrific family. 

There was not a dry eye in the house when that mom did the most loving and painful thing I have ever seen a mom do. 

No question. Just I have seen how hard a decision it is and how honorable and loving it is to do it. 

Thank you."
124,"Family has a strong power of you. They can lift you up or drag you down. Have clear boundaries with anyone in your life you have a relationship with (whether friends or family). Let people raise you up and support you, but don’t give people the power to drag you down. 

Dunno if that helps."
125,Got friends and family aplenty. Thanks for your support.
126,Velveeta all day man!
127,I will not stand for this 
128,How do you market something like that?
129,How tho? My wife sits but I stand I’ve tried sitting and it just doesn’t work I need like a step by step walk through 
130,"Hmm, are you sure you aren't dead? What about undead? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you walk around really slow with a limp? Do you have an unbeknownst desire for human flesh? What about brainsssss?"
131,"Its alright!

My brain could've picked a worse food to eat every day lol. I've heard of some with the same disorder who eat nothing but beans or McDonalds chicken nuggets every day "
132,Who was the first person that called you/your family to send their condolences?
133,"I don’t really think you can understand someone else’s mind set. I try to be sympathetic, but it definitely is hard to be logical when it’s someone you know. 

I dont think it was selfish, he was probably doing what he thought was best for all of us. He was wrong, but I don’t blame him, he was lost and confused.

Nah, it didn’t change my views, and I don’t think it’s selfish, I don’t understand it, but I’m sure to the person who feels that way it makes the most sense.
"
134,"Those breakdown crying moments will continue, even years down the road. Spontaneously and uncontrollable at times, but they will get further spaced out over time.

 My opinion from my own personal experience. My dad committed suicide by hanging in 2006, I was 19. We were not incredibly close as I grew up, he lived far away from me most of my life, until I was 13. But I know he loved me very deeply. Internet hug coming your way, I'm so sorry for what you are going through. "
135,"Not trying to be judgmental or just an asshole in general, but how come people hire a date for high school formal events? I don’t think it’s wrong, just curious. "
136,"It was a slow process and lots of attorneys. First the credit reporting agencies brought me back to life, then Lexis, then the Secretary of State and the IRS. Then I was declared deceased AGAIN and it all restarted. I should mention that I am a junior and my father lived with us, so we had the same address. However, with SS#, DOB, etc. you would think it would be impossible to make such an error in this day and age. Now I am alive but unfortunately my father's final medical expenses are being posted to my credit reports now as collections, so I am still unable to conduct business as I should. I am committed to my own success, whatever it takes. Positivity is the key, even when things are at their worst."
137,"Sorry. I thought you worked through the kids. Never thought of parents bringing you in. 

How much per night? "
138,"Well thanks for sharing anyway, quite an interesting life story, hopefully you still have plenty of family and friends around you though."
139,I've done about 15 events. Some kids get a little bold but it's been nothing I can't handle. I've never had any real trouble.
140,"I mean, some of them are really sweet kids. It’s basically small talk plus some advice and encouragement but I wouldn’t say it’s impersonal. 

As I said elsewhere, I’ll let them have a kiss at the end of the evening if they’ve been gentlemen.

Usually I’m a friend from another school or a family friend visiting from out-of-town, something like that. Occasionally the kids are just straight-up honest that I’m a hired date."
141,Wow! 
142,"Solid AMA and good responses

oh wait "
143,Omg. I'm so sorry for your loss! Do you have support? ❤
144,U
145,"If it's a restaurant where I'm comfortable with than I'll order mac and cheese, or spaghetti with no meat sauce. But if it doesnt have either of those then I'll just skip the meal entirely and just talk "
146,"I’m 23 and have a good avoidance disorder. To set the scene, I have a very very limited set of plain foods that I will eat, and although I like cheese (cheddar) on toast I had a panic attack when my boyfriend made me cheese (red Leicester) on toast and couldn’t eat it.

After years of mentally preparing myself I’ve started trying foods. 

I started off with battered fish as fish fingers were already a food I’d like so I knew it would probably be safe. I’ve also now tried a tiny tiny amount of an apple because it seemed plain enough to be safe.

Moral of the story is: I know how upsetting, depressing &amp; frustrating a food avoidance disorder is. Especially when it comes to social gatherings and you wish you could just fit in and be normal and enjoy food. But if I can make progress when I thought it was beyond hope - even if it’s super small progress - I’m sure you can too.

Best of luck! My heart goes out to you "
147,How did you...why...what....you SAW?!
148,Perfectly balanced
149,"I like you OP. I know this is a tough day but it sounds like you did the right thing and you sound like an amazing person. Your kid is going to be taken care of. The people who are able to adopt in situations like yours never take anything for granted and they love those babies so much, your kid is going to get an education and will appreciate the sacrifice you made for her. Real talk, what about you today though? You okay? Maybe a nice meal would be nice for you tonight to get your mind off everything or even a milkshake or something like that? DM me a restaurant that is close to you and I will put a gift card in your name there so you can get a nice dinner. If not tonight maybe tomorrow or Sunday. Or maybe a pedicure or something like that? I just don't want you to forget to take care of yourself in a time like this, DM me info and I will put something nice in your name close to you, it can stay anonymous you don't have to give a name or anything, I'll put it in your username and they will honor that at the restaurant or shop."
150,"rock to the side so that one butt cheek is lifted a fair distance off the seat. Reach under that butt cheek (coming in from the side) and wipe

The bonus of this method is that the act of rocking to the side spreads your butt open, giving you clean access to your asshole, so you can wipe it without spreading shit anywhere"
151,All things being equal the 2nd half of your life should be amazing
152,"As a plumber, please tell me you don't flush the wipes. "
153,Grabbed their butt to establish dominance 
154,"I don't know your mom but she sounds amazing. She could be like, look at me, I did all the work, I am your mom but she also points out that your birth mom loved you as well, and wanted what is best for you. Thank you my friend, I hope you have a good weekend!"
155,Breh
156,"My average time per country is 11.4 days. I need to spend more than 24 hours in a country to count a visit and “only” spent 24 hours and 17 minutes within the Vatican. I also did not spend two nights in South Sudan nor Yemen. However I did spend 102 days in Lebanon.

Japan is next. Ferry from South Korea.

It has mostly been alone although I’ve had visitors and for short stretches I have sometimes met people and traveled with them. My sister recently visited for a week. My fiancée has been out here 19 times.

I plan to write a book and seek a career as a motivational speaker.

Cheers."
157,"Your professor is 100% correct on that. That recipe is used the world over to help people with any illness that causes diarrhea, especially things like cholera."
158,Nah he meant asshole.
159,Congratz my boi
160,Not really. I can pass for 18. If anyone asks I'm just a friend from a different school.
161,"You know, I tried brains but they were a little to gamey for my tastes. I added the limp just for special effects!"
162,Which country have you thought “I wish I spent more time there” about after leaving?
163,"I wasn't expecting modest. I figured you're probably hot if your being paid to be a date. 

So in 3 years how many events have you attended? Has anybody ever gotten out of hand or tried anything more than just being company? "
164,"I like to embroider things. Pillowcases, handkerchiefs, things like that. Sewing.  I like to read. I'm not very interesting, I'm afraid."
165,The hardest thing is to just go. I know i want to just push it off but I’m forcing myself to make an appointment.....tomorrow.
166,What’s your best and or favorite memory of him? 
167,"I have read some of this post. many will wonder about your reasons, i won't. we all need a way to cope with tragic events and i happen to think this will help because i never had the balls to ask OR answer things like this. It's apparent to me that you are using this experience as a learning tool. I have been on both sides of this  situation, sort of, (me and my son at different times and for different reasons both attempted suicide). we've both learned not to dwell too much on either the future nor (especially) the past. Live well my friend.
"
168,"Not really. Id say the one it destroyed the most was my relationship with myself.  That took a good year and a half to rebuild.  I did cease contact with everyone I was friends with in the  scene for a long time.  Years. I recently got in contact with a few people from back in the day and it was great to see they walked away from it and put their lives back together.  Some weren't so lucky, some have passed away."
169,Very good bot 
170,Whoever buys single ply toilet paper just doesn’t love themselves. 
171,I had this on a 13 hour international flight. I broke a toilet. It was one of the worst flights of my life.
172,Good thing you are not a girl or you'd be saying hello to UTIs every now and then. lol
173,"Yes, and stay away from strange Arab dudes on the beach.  "
174,"I will be messaging you on [**2039-04-09 19:14:54 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2039-04-09 19:14:54 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/bbanmp/im_a_normal_guy_and_i_just_submitted_a_foia_for/ekhpw7z/)

175,"North Dakota, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Hawaii, Alaska, and Rhode Island ! "
176,I have the utmost respect for you.
177,"I did, I watched it when I was way to young to be watching it and loved it."
178,"I don't crave it at all. I miss a few aspects of using though.  Dancing for a ridiculous amount of time, epic marathon art and sex sessions.  Don't miss feeling sketched out though."
179,Boiled cows skin in a soup. It’s pretty much tied with bashed goats brain though...
180,"I'm so glad he was your dad. And I'm so sad he's gone. Grandmother here, giving you a long hug. "
181,"I will take you up on that. Nathan is actually laid to rest in Rhode Island with other family members, so that’s what I’ll also be doing when visiting the state. "
182,"As someone who has been adopted, thank you for caring for your kid's well-being over your own wishes. I hope your kid knows that she was adopted by a loving family not because you didn't want her, but because you wanted the best for her."
183,"You father sounded like an incredible man. I don't  have a question for you, just wanted to say I'm not surprised you seem to have pulled through this situation as I am sure he made you a stronger person."
184,"That’s just western propaganda. I could take photos and video of at least 95% of what I saw. It’s was totally cool. You just can’t take photos of soldiers, military installations and construction sites. The construction sites because the workers are military. Those are fairly normal conditions in a lot of countries. 

The punishment for violating rules in North Korea are however far stricter than in most other countries so you better behave ;)"
185,"You will not believe how many questions I’ve answered over the years and how rare it is to get one I’ve never heard before! Well done!! :)

The rain season caught me twice in Africa: West Africa and Central Africa. That wasn’t ideal in terms of mud and mosquitoes in some less developed regions.

I got to spend a Ramadan in the Middle East during the summer. Even a lot of locals leave. Unimaginable hot, everything closed early and I couldn’t drink water outside until the sun set. So that wasn’t optimal.

And finally winter caught up with me as I headed to Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Those two happen to have the coldest capitals in the world (Astana and Ulaanbaatar). Not ideal but an experience."
186,"As someone who's wife can't have a child, we will be adopting when we get a house, thank you."
187,He's icing his balls
188,"My whole family had it about three weeks ago.  You should be nearing the end of the really bad symptoms and soon should be able to shower and go to bed.  Make sure you keep drinking every time you wake up which you will do everytime you have to turn over. 
You will find muscles you didnt know you had.
I stayed in bed for a full 24 hours after my symptoms ended but remember, you are contagious for at least 48 hours after symptoms. 
Stay as far from that baby as possible.
Feel better soon xx"
189,Bruh
190,"Did it cause any long lasting financial issues for you? If so, are you going after anyone for this issue?"
191,Why doesn’t the fattest man in the world become a hockey goalie?
192,Which of the 177 countries is your favorite so far and why? 
193,Oh sweet summer child
194,"The boundaries are clear and it’s never been a problem. If a kid is a gentleman and asks for one at the end of the night, I’ll give him a kiss. But it’s entirely up to me.

Dads hitting on me is more of a problem, but I’ve gotten good at shutting that down fast."
