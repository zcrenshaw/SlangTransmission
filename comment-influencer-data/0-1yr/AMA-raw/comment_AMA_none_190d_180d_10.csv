0,I wish
1,"Thanks for replying, hang in there man i hope it gets better for you! :) "
2,Are all of your criminal acts related to drug use? Have they made it difficult to get a job now that you are sober?
3,What are your family's thoughts on all of this?
4,When did you think ''I'm done with this'' and how did you battle the addictions? 
5,They definitely hire the weirdos and then you have to deal with their emotional baggage when you are trying to get work done.  Everyone has their own issues just don't bring em to work
6,Morale was at an all time low when I left last July.  They gaslight people every chance they get.  It's a bad place to work
7,"Hey, poppin-pocky, just a quick heads-up:  
**bizzare** is actually spelled **bizarre**. You can remember it by **one z, double -r**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
8,How did you find your destinations? 
9,Sounds fun but what are the benefits if knowing these things after graduating?
10,$42 and I was super excited. It was a big order at some estate. The lady had me walk all the way around the house I guess they were setting up for a wedding since it was filled with flowers. After taking the pizzas out and being as nice as possible she signed the credit card and I was shocked. I came back to the restaurant and gave the staff some money
11,"How long do you typically spend at these places? 

Considering they’re abandoned, what happens if someone has to use the bathroom?"
12,"Nice!  There’s a lot of white too, so you can add vanilla to that description. "
13,"I don't support any unconsented sexual acts between minors or animals and there's enough info to prove him guilty, so I find him as a overall bad person, enhanced by his attempts of denying his accusations. 

I don't like the witch hunting though, it comes off as bullying and pretty bad in itself. Just pointing out the facts and cut ties with him is good enough. Public shaming in any circumstance imo is pretty bad and low."
14,My home-country is Sweden. I speak English on a native-level. I speak Swedish. I understand Norwegian and Danish and I speak very basic finnish as well as beginner's French and Italian.
15,I am from the UK
16,"Some additional questions if you don’t mind: 

Would you recommend someone take up a trade school (specifically welding)? 

How much math is required in welding? (I ask since I’ve been considering if I should do a trade school (specifically welding since it sounds cool) and I’m terrible at math)

Can you like take a day off or something for a vacation, etc.? 

What was your first day on the job like? 

How often do you encounter military veterans in your trade? "

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
What's the strangest thing you have found?|Possibly the morgue at a hospital - with those metal slabs still there. I guess it's not so much strange as creepy. Likewise for random dental x-rays from children.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz14ja/)
What was your favorite place that you explored?|I explored an abandoned factory that was part of a [larger community](https://abandonedhudsonvalley.com/letchworth-village/). If I recall correctly, the factory provided power to a series of buildings where patients were being treated. All of the machinery was still intact and it was possible to climb up ladders, go inside giant industrial chimneys, tiny walkways above huge storage tanks. Pretty wild place!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehyyxpf/)
Have you found any treasure?|No treasure yet but I keep looking. I've been to a few missile bases and I couldn't even find where they kept the missiles … gotta dig deeper.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz35z2/)
How do you not shit yourself with fear? I’m paranoid within my own walls at night time let alone somewhere creepy.|It can be scary! But for safety reasons I never explore alone so that certainly helps.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz6edg/)
Ever have anything scary happen?|One time a friend tried to scare me. We were in a very large gun battery within an abandoned military base. He goes into a pitch dark room to hide and wait for me to come in. Unfortunately for him I wasn't scare when he jumped out at me and when we looked inside with our flashlights - he has been standing a couple of feet away from a large hole in the ground which very clearly had been part of the latrines … he was perma scared to go into dark rooms without a flashlight after that … close call.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz4ku0/)
Do you have any interest in flying quadcopters?  Flying in and around abandoned buildings looks like a lot of fun. I haven’t personally found a location to try this yet...|&gt;quadcopters  I've never tried but that's a great idea!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz8pt6/)
What time of day do you go?  I’d personally would WANT to go at night  But I’d probably trip over something and die before even getting inside|I only went during the daylight. At night you have a lower risk of getting caught but as you pointed out, it's also more dangerous. And it's more a pain to get places/travel in the middle of the night.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz9435/)
Favorite beer and favorite president ?|In terms of a single beer, probably Sculpin or Todd the Axe Man. But my favorite brewery is called Mikkeller - they make tons of delicious brews all over the world. George Washington.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz936h/)
I used to be a real estate appraiser for various counties. I would get paid to do this stuff, and since I was working for the county, trespassing laws didn't apply. It was a pretty sweet gig|That's amazing! What's the easiest way to find out who owns a building other than having to go through the county records?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehzn9im/)
I explore utility, cable and telecommunication tunnels. Been arrested a few times... Fun finding ways past alarms and motion sensors 😆|That's living on the edge! How do you usually get out of the arrests?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehz9r0w/)
Have you ever found anything of value? Follow-up question: do you ever take anything from the places you explore?|I never take anything that I find and I never break anything during my trip. That includes locks, doors or fences \~ I simply take a look around, explore and take pictures. I have seen plenty of weird objects but nothing of value. I think that most places have been scrubbed by 1) the people who previously occupied the building and 2) subsequent looters. The only places where I never see objects are military bases … they scrub those clean.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehzl6uq/)
How do you find abandoned houses/buildings? In what country do you live?|I live in the U.S. and I use two methods.  1) google abandoned places in a particular area  2) Scour google maps. If you look through old industrial cities, you are bound to come across abandoned factories - they'll look older and have no cars parked around them. You'd also be surprised how many civil war forts I've come across just looking at areal views of east coast cities.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehzltzv/)
You know of anything cool in South Florida I could visit?|Back in the cold war, the government built a few missile bases in South Florida. There's an abandoned one at the very edge of Miami and another one by the keys. There's even one in the middle of the everglades that you can take a tour of but the park rangers don't let you go inside. I never did more research than that but I am sure that there are local communities who know more!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/ay889a/i_explore_abandoned_buildings_for_fun_urbex_ama/ehzn70r/)

26,"My brother and I were raised by someone with severe narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), our mother (We didn’t know it growing up.) And for whatever reason I was the golden child who could do no wrong, no matter what I did I was praised and defended (sounds great on paper but there’s a lot of manipulation that came with that, the only person I was ever allowed to accept praise from was my mother.) so as my brother and I got older, we started realizing/understanding  her traits/tactics and how she used guilt and manipulation to get family to do what she wanted and I began to realize the similarities (as well as the differences) between her and I. That’s what kinda keyed me into that maybe there was something wrong with me (this was happening at the same time my relationship was falling apart because I couldn’t stop myself from looking for attention outside of my relationship - yes I know. Dick move, but it’s more like an addiction than anything else.) 

So as I was growing up, the only way to get attention was to be histrionic (theatrical/dramatic) and that was how I was raised to earn love and attention. To be literally “histrionic.” Going back to my mother, she always made me the center of attention and that kind of became the only way I was able understand and accept love and affection. If I wasn’t the center of the conversation/party then I felt like I wasn’t good enough. All that just kind of rolled into adulthood and I was so unwilling to admit that anything was wrong with me (because I was “never wrong” growing up) that I never bothered to even think about personality disorders until: a. My fiancé left and b. My brother and I were trying to figure out what was wrong with our mother. 

Sorry if that’s long winded, this is therapeutic for me. "
27,Did you acquire any superpowers?
28,Have you ever found anything of value? Follow-up question: do you ever take anything from the places you explore?
29,RemindMe! 1 day
30,How do you find abandoned houses/buildings? In what country do you live?
31,what's the capital of wyoming?
32,Small world man! Im up in Olathe myself. But yeah so long as it is non violent i believe or arson you should be able to. It also helps to get an expungement but that cant always happen.
33,Happy microphone day though!
34,"Yes, I did get cookies. Also, got a free mug :)"
35,Was her job extremely demanding or did she have a relatively large amount of time off?
36,"Yes, he is. We've had to adjust to things sexually, but I'd say any other area of our relationship is fairly standard."
37,"She learned that she might be a little bisexual after doing her first lesbian shoot. That was pretty interesting to know. She also mentioned that the smell was sometimes horrible on set. And that she always had to use a lot of lube.

I don't know if those are exactly funny but at least they're work related stories. "
38,"She started doing it before we met. I wanna say like 3 months into it? And I actually talked to my buddy and my brothers about it. They all said if you don't date her, you'll always wonder what it would have been like that to date her. So I said why not try it?"
39,"Sweet man lol my girls dad lives there owns his own estate sale business going up there to see him tomorrow with her lol yeah idk I guess if I had to I'd even travel my grandpa was a fire fighter and I don't have any violent felonies just one and that was drug, got misdeamenor dui and some theft charges but was usually drug theft charges one from Wal Mart and a drunk and disorderly felony was 5 or 6 years ago finally getting sober off booze and drugs actually my 18 months today. Just want a job Im proud of and that feels like your doing something and matter to someone or the community ya know? "
40,"So he isn't poly, which means the 3rd isn't either."
41,"Unites States of America (Republicans): hold our beers

U.S. Republicans: *Support Trump*"
42,I only saw normal looking people at the audition. No stars.
43,This is a throwaway account for that exact reason. 
44,You can pm me if you want :) 
45,"Hey the mustache is fun when it tickles your pickle.

Wow that's a bad joke...."
46,I would have said that's good to hear and then change the subject to something else. Lol
47,What's it like to date a person? I've never done it before.
48,"First she does an AMA that she wants to marry her 36yo ex social worker (which by the way she contradicted herself in her posts as to when this person was her social worker), then next day she posts on relationshipadvice that shes 12weeks pregnant. And the next day she posts how her sister was being sexually advanced by this guy when she was a 14yo or smth. Yea, I'm sure that all happened. And just read some of ""her"" responses, it's literally so obv. this person is a troll, and reddit eats it up. I don't know if I should think it's hilarious or really sad. "
49,Like 5”
50,Did other students ever recognize her?
51,"Not about to lie, I have no recollection of commenting this, or have ANY idea of what I was trying to ask. "
52,My friend told me a month before she did so I was prepared already. But yeah it was still shocking to hear it from her mouth.
53,Shut up faggot mind your own business and let the guy answer if he wants.
54,Dumbest story in the bible?
55,What was your dream?
56,How many fat chics?
57,"He was shot, I have friends and a lot. "
58,"I look at a picture of my daughter I carry with me.
I have a picture of a man who had just died from a overdose who is my age, 38. On the side of this mans bed is his 9 year old daughter screaming and obviously distraught while her mother tries to comfort her. I look at that and I don’t want to do that to my daughter, but i had to get out of the fog of drugs to understand that. My girlfriend is amazing and she has pushed and helped me find myself. A muse. "
59,How was she in bed?
60,What are the things you dislike about him?
61,We liked to switch off who got to wear them
62,someone give this man gold
63,"Do you know the cause? Is it a nerve issue? Have you always had this?
"
64,"Reading, writing poetry and short stories, taxidermy and specimen collection/ preparation"
65,"Not that I'm aware of. But I was born premature, so it's probably just been like that from birth"
66,what did it feel like?
67,May you have a happy day of cake.
68,Someone asked me in the comments if I would recommend dating a pornstar. I think it'd be difficult for most people. I'm sure every day at least one dude is wacking off to her naked. That's just hard to get out of your head. Almost made me not want to watch porn anymore. 
69,My back is straight i put my feet to one corner and my head to the other with a pillow for comfiness. 
70,I think its more like 6
71,"i didn’t know AMAs had to have a controversial topic, sorry. my parents and sister are christian, my mom and sister aren’t so serious about it but my dad is. he’s not gonna beat me up if i tell him i don’t believe in god anymore but he’d try to convince me otherwise. my grandparents are buddhist and i live in a house with an altar and a lot of buddhist figures"
72,"I'll bet. 

Did/does she have any plans beyond just porn? "
73,There is no proof he slept with stormy Daniels 
74,"Getting a PT will probably be done privately, so I doubt there'd be too long a waiting time. The consultants and all the tests etc are done on the NHS, so it's public healthcare, hence massive waiting lists"
75,r/thatHappened
76,"Don't feel bad for her, sounds like she's getting more popular. I don't assume she's doing private porn that has leaked, so more eyes means more success in terms of being in public eye... theoretically. Plus, she chose to do this for a job, hopefully. And she's getting drilled by big dongs all day. She's fine. "
77,"I mean if your guy is into that kind of stuff,  all the more power to you. 😅 I prefer tongue over teeth but maybe I'm just a simple guy."
78,Hold up
79,What is your favorite genre of porn?
80,"Honestly, the same thought went through my mind when I started this relationship. That's why I've told people on here that I wouldn't suggest it because it's not what most guys want in my opinion. "
81,That's so polite.  Thank you! 
82,"Thinking I was dead? I was just waiting for something to happen. It was super not scary, I had a split second thought of ""that kinda sucks for my mom and dad"" but other than that was super calm, just wondering what was gonna happen lol"
83,"Yeah. I went to a LOT of those growing up. A lot of them helped, and a lot of them did not."
84,I thought she wanted to keep it secret. Why did she tell your buddy? 
85,A shirt and jeans
86,"No OP but I'm also a pizza delivery driver. 

1. No. Any place where drivers are on minimum wage and depend on tips that make their drivers pay for their own fuel is downright fucking evil. At least where I work the boss pays for fuel since it's a tax deductable business expense. 

2. Very near the point of just ""snapping"" and getting violent. I have come storming back into the shop after a series of bad customers so mad the boss ordered me to go home cos I was at real risk of getting violent. I'm normally a very chilled out and relaxed guy, but some of these fucks can just get under your skin. 

3. I'm Australian and the minimum wage here is much higher than in the U.S. I like tips, they give me some extra money to take home before payday which can really come in handy. But in the U.S tipping is mandatory because it's basically the only way delivery drivers actually make any money. "
87,Dean all the way. Sam just seems to complain a lot. Dean just bottles it all up. I can relate to that.
88,"Yeah I agree , I love the office parks a rec got
A little tacky at times and can’t really stand rob Lowe but just my opinion"
89,"Nah, I’m good"
90,Did you guys have an open relationship? I mean she had sex with others so I would think you could too.
91,"I was, but not because of my incontinence. I was born prematurely, at 27 weeks, so I've other issues, like damaged vocal cords and tight tendons in my legs so I can't run for any length of time. As I was at a sporty school that's what drew most of the bullying"
92,Kajit get very jealous 
93,"It definitely made it hard ""no pun intended "" to watch porn for a while. It sucks now because every so often I'll see her name pop up on a website I'm on and then I'll lose interest again. But it's been getting better!"
94,Favorite music?
95,Over a year?! That’s ridiculous. Hopefully finding and getting a PT won’t be as difficult or long as that process
96,"Scholarships, loans, join the military for a GI bill, Starbucks and other places will pay for part of your school. Community college is a cheaper alternative. "
97,"Lmao, yeah I probably know maybe 3 big time porn stars name. She is known by basically every guy who watches porn."
98,"Not really, he's a sub so he enjoys most of it. Plus, I'm only 25, I mean boyfriends do come and go. 

I suppose you could say that, I mean I do care about him. "
99,How many STIs did you catch?
100,"I think it’s great you continued posting. Some find it annoying, to me it shows you really care about somebody who REALLY needs to be cared about. And now she’s leaving him. Good on you kind human. "
101,"I do, I do care about him."
102,Haha thats crazy as I was reading all these responses I was like I bet its Riley Reid 
103,"Before I would have said no but looking back now,  I'd say yeah it was probably a big reason why."
104,"What are you most ashamed of in your entire life? Specifically something that you are at fault for, like an action, not something you can't control (like if someone sprayed you with mud and everyone made fun of you)."
105,What languages do you use?  Do you have a GitHub?
106,Speak for yourself. If it ain’t illegal then I don’t care much about what goes on in a politician’s personal life. Policy over privacy!
107,"i have a brother that’s retarded, i call him that every time i see him, and let me tell u, he is dumb af"
108,"There is definitely something that sets you apart from everyone else, the cookie cutter is a lie and does not apply to you. "
109,They aren't :/
110,"Gross. Actually, if there is a need to inspect their vagina, the inmate does it themselves with female staff present. Squat and cough."
111,"Have you ever had to deal with someone trying to convert you, and if so, what did you say in return?"
112,"Do you think it has made you sexualize women more?

 Do you see them more as your next sexual conquest, or, do you see them as you did before you lost your virginity?"
113,"It does rain a LOT here. There is a lean towards cremation but i think it has less to do with weather and more to do with personal preference. I have conducted funerals in all sorts of weather- snow, storms and heavy rain. Unfortunately there is no predicting the weather here and people take the attitude that the show must go on regardless. "
114,"Honestly, the inmates are too stupid to attempt something like that."
115,"For the first question, it’s social skills. Social skills because I can’t see some unspoken social cues but then I can’t process and lean them when I do eventually notice. Watching others my age and younger being successful social being is disheartening and sometimes I just hide.

I’d love people to know in advance that I ease into things really slowly and it will take me ages to open up. There might also be a stage in our friendship where I feel awkward and in the way and might accidentally ouch people away. I don’t want to do that and would apologise multiple times in advance if u could tell people while meeting.

Creme Eggs!"
116,Have you slept with anyone underage? If so... Don't reply or reply saying No
117,I have a book. I put down a number every time I sleep with someone. 
118,[removed]
119,Is it the number of pedos or the protection of rapists?
120,how do you feel about modern music
121,Thought of joining the Secular Student Alliance?

123,"Ironically, not a lot because they're more interested in men who can advance their career."
124,"Yes, I am heavily into Urban exploration and even have a YouTube channel for it. Due to college I don't get to do it as much as I would want, but I still do it quite often. Other than the Asylum today on Sunday I will be going to PA's abandoned highway tunnels, and the 16th of March I will be spending the night in an abandoned prison."
125,"It’s weird sometimes, I’m hyper aware of every action, move and sentiment behind most people interpretation of me. It has a lot of the same qualities of a psychopath/sociopath. I’m able to read situations very well, tell when people are attracted to me, but I don’t know if that’s from the HPD or the fact that I was raised by a narcissist. I know a trait HPD is being just as able to manipulate as someone with NPD, but they (people with HPD) use it just for attention and not to manipulate. 

Hope that makes sense. "
126,Gimme V Bucks RN
127,How's the herpes been?
128,Do you explore abandoned and scary places often?
129,Nope. My only goal on the first date was to get a second.
130,"They don't know. And I don't think that's I be the only thing to disappoint them, or my dad particularly.

I'm homoflexible."

"
134,"My addiction and lifestyle has given me PTSD and paranoid delusional jealousy which reeks havoc on my relationships currently and tears my mental state up,  my brain plays games with my head and I don’t know what to believe and what not to believe sometimes and then mixed with PTSD it’s just almost unbearable at times. I have to hold on with White knuckles most the time but that’s minimal in comparison I think to what my wife has to go through because of it. I’m currently seeing a psychiatrist and being treated with medication for it right now but it’s a slow process. "
135,There is something I always wanted to ask to people who are sober after years of drug abuse: how does you body feel right now that you quit? Do you feel that your addiction has significantly damaged your body even now that you quit or you managed to heal almost completely?
136,"I also love abandonednyc.com and untappedcities.com

I used to post pictures but never as many or as professional as the others out there!"
137,"There are many reason to hate the community, and we do hate the bad sides of it as well. It doesn't really generalize the whole community, but they are usually the most pointed out ones and people establish their opinion from these minorities. Dig deeper, and you'll find there are really decent people in the community and that we are actually good people, except for the outliars, which also exist outside of the fandom.

The very pointy weird side of the community usually is the reference point for all of the fandom, yet it can be a very nice community."
138,Youtube channel?
139,Lopeta tollane venyttely vitun ling-nisti
140,"What’s the best method of research to find abandoned places? I do exploring/adventure stuff on my YT channel but not abandoned places, would love to do one or two "

158,Cuz spammy. 
159,"She told me that she had to get tested before every shoot and also every 2-3 weeks. That was the company's policy. If she actually did that, I don't know. "

165,Favorite sexual position
166,"We were together for almost a year. We knew each other for almost 2 years though. 

Good question, it matches your username.
I think the most important lesson I learned was that if you want a relationship to work, both parties have to be involved and willing to make some sacrifices. Some things she that she would do would piss me off and some things I did pissed her off. You have to communicate with your partner to fix these issues. 

And I didn't like telling many people since she wanted to keep it discreet but the guys who knew were mostly jealous and the girls who knew were mostly disgusted. "
167,What’s your best advice to stay relaxed and not look stiff?

173,"It's like having a best friend who you get to see naked. And they get to sleep in bed with you. Definitely a great thing, highly recommend. "
174,"Nope. Was going about 50 mph (everyone was due to the ice/slush), was switching into the right lane, and when I hit the ice my car jerked even more to the right and my instinct was to slam the brakes, which I'm assuming caused them to lock up and basically just threw my car into a cement gutter thing on the side of the highway, hence the flipping and rolling "
175,"So you're 32, unemployed, live in NYC and do some kind of deliveries for cash. Tou also post a lot of stuff on this sub. You must be really bored and trolling for attention. "
176,I don’t get it? Maybe a breaking bad reference idk. 
177,I think I clearly indicated that I am Dominant. 
178,I wish more and more people were like this! Imagine what we could accomplish. 
179,did she look into your eyes like in the videos?
180,Why are you like this 
181,Why did she decide to go into porn out of all things?
182,it was with a previous bf. He was so hard and big and it went on soo long.
183,Is your primary significant other unavailable or unresponsive to your affection and communication?
184,"I needed a place to live, they had a place listed so I toured it, during the tour he said that some college students had trouble paying and he was always flexible, we got lunch after and he pitched the idea"
185,"Hey, UnbreakableDamnIT, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
186,How much money was she bringing in? A lot? 
187,"I’m in the UK, you see a fair few abandoned buildings, old quarries, sometimes a decrepit mil base, quite a few old factories and old abandoned train infrastructure too"
188,"Wow that's crazy! I was chased by dogs on several occasions, but thankfully never bit. The job definitely forces you to be mindful of your surroundings. I never did commercial, just residential and CAUV inspections. We had a few women appraisers but most of them weren't comfortable doing it by themselves, especially out in the rural areas. "
189,What if... what if he breaks both his arms?
190,Did it bother you that your friends knew what your girlfriend looked liked naked and would beat it to her porn performances? 
191,This didn’t answer his question at all though
192,My pleasure :)
193,"Me too, but I dated her well before she got into the game. Did you date her while she was active?"
194,How expenaive was the experience?
195,Have you watched any of her videos since breaking up?
196,"How soon into the relationship did you find out she did porn.... Was it like a 1st date convo?

Did you believe her?"
197,I do feel he does yes. But we did a lot very quickly . Moved in after 6 months or so. Got pregnant. Lost the baby. Got our own place. Got married after 2 years. Then pregnant again. Lost it again. And June this year is 6 years married. 
198,Pics?
199,20 an hour for 3 hours
200,I never asked her that question. She was incredibly attractive so I didn't have any desire to sleep with anyone else. Well besides her one friend.... but that happened after we broke up.
201,"Luckily she had a few close friends before she started this job. I would never tell her what people would say to me. 

She made friends real easily with the stoners at our university but besides them and her orginal friends she never cared to meet new people. "
202,Thank you :) 
203,"I don’t have a question, but mad respect for you for this AMA. Sorry for the idiots who can’t respect your personal boundaries. This was a very enlightening thread!"
204,It definitely made me feel weird knowing my brothers or friends could see her naked anytime but I just thought hey they can look at the video but can't have the real thing.
205,The sex was fun. We got to do it a lot. I didn't have a giant dick so I didn't hurt her at all. Plus we got to enjoy passionate sex instead of the jackhammer type stuff that isn't all that great.
206,"Although it seems obvious, what did it smell like? B.O., Budussy, locker room? All of the above? "
207,Oops misread that. Umm..anything with chocolate lol
208,"About two years prior, the guy who serviced the ATMs in our area was run off the road and murdered. Our town had 3 ATMs that were serviced by him, and I was good friends with a few of the business owners that had them in their business. They had to get rid of them and replace them, so my brother and I removed them from the businesses"
209,Cool but also sorry for your loss. Hope you feel better. 
210,Favorite hobby?
211,"Are beyblades like collectable treasures now, or do people practically give them away on ebay? Are they hard to get? Are they still sold in stores?"
212,do you have a wish ?
213,"Well, I just say I'm normal since theres really nothing special about me."
214,What’s the kinkiest act you guys have done under the sheets?
215,Oh ok then no. It's all been online. Because I can't bare to upset him. 
216,I guess I can't really answer about being one but my ex told me it smells pretty bad on set sometimes. And you can't be the jealous type if youre dating a pornstar. It can't work then.
217,"My jurisdiction was the 2nd or 3rd largest in the country, and I did commercial, but after I left I thought about creating a company that could outsource the inspections.  When I started it was a 100' measuring tape, and the guys who did residential would wear rubber pants so dog bites didnt ruin their clothes.  I fought to add women to the inspection ranks, and did, but fell short on allowing mandatory interior inspections.  "
218,Definitely not. I didn't think I would like her as much as I did but still couldn't see her as wifey material. 
219,"Hey, UnbreakableDamnIT, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
220,I think that’s the joke my dude
221,"State law requires a full reappraisal of every parcel of property in the county, every six years. So every six years, someone can come onto your property and check the values. They can't come into your house, but whatever can be seen from the outside is fair game. They also send you a list questions regarding the inside of your house. Nine times out of ten they take your word for it. If you don't send it back, they just guess, in their favor.

Also, if you refuse to allow a county assessor onto your property, they will go get a sheriff's deputy to esscort them back. I had to do that once in my career. "
222,6
223,"That’s more than me and my partner do now, but twice a week for accommodation is 100% worth it"
224,"It depends. Am I diagnosed with depression? Yes. Do I self harm because I'm depressed? No, not exactly. Usually when I SH it's because I'm extremely emotional, angry or tense, or I'm numb and just don't care. "
225,Whales and dolphins
226,"Was she ever an escort? How much did they pay per set? 
Did she had personaly wierd fetishes? 

How long/often did she liked to have sex with you?
"
227,She never did anal in porn but told me you get paid a lot for your first anal scene. I somehow convinced her to see if she liked it with me. And she enjoyed it so that was fun.
228,"Yes but this isn’t something that you need every time you have sex with him right? My SO is large too and sometimes I need lube as well but not nearly every time.

It’s been said that this girl needs lube every time she works. She’s just there for the good $$ and has no attachment to these men, whereas she felt something for OP and probably rarely, if ever needed to use lube with him. 

I’m just speaking from personal experience."
229,Thank you for the precautions. I thought it was weird of that specific question as well.
230,Are you nude right now?
231,Age
232,"Yeah, just in general."
233,"Where are you from? Are you excited to be 14? Also, happy birthday!"
234,How do you live with yourself?
235,"Did she ever eat man ass, or female ass? Was she ever snowballed on a toilet seat, both on film and real life?"
236,I'm definitely going to do a Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy group. I might do some testing at the Amen Clinic. They do some brain scans. 
237,Ouh yeah. Well finished. Lol
238,What are things that people wouldn't guess about being a porn star? And dating one?
