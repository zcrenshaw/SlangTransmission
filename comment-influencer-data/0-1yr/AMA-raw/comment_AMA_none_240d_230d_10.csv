0,"This thread just made me want to try to adopt my 2 young grandkids I'm raising, because they have never been ""in the system"" and I want to make sure they never are. Thank you. "
1,Dude I feel you except all my friends are growing up doing some sketchy shit so I work overnights for the same reason. 
2,"Firstly, your self awareness is admirable in itself. I believe, deep in my soul, that if you are worried about being good parents then you are already halfway there to being the best. Mental health, disablities and appearance do not limit you on your ability to love, nurture and support a child. It is your heart that counts, I truly mean this. My adoptive mothers mental health issues would have given her some amazing advice to pass on to me. My adoptive father's navigation in this world with Aspergers-like traits have given me so much love, acceptance, patience and perspective. 
You will be amazing and I thank you so for wanting to adopt. You don't understand how much it means. If I had been placed with you then, oh me oh my, life would have been grand. "
3,"Not a question just some (potentially poor) advice but, I’ve found it’s usually easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission. "
4,Probably a gimp suit. I just put it with the clothing that goes to charity. Oh god Lord what did I do lol 
5,Weird flex but okay
6,"I replied previously but realised I read your question wrong, sorry!   
My adoptive Mother has mental issues, they're really serious sometimes. It is almost like severe OCD and anxiety, she is only professionally diagnosed with the later. I am not allowed to cook in the kitchen unless I can sense her mood is ok enough. She feels like I am invading her territory. I have to tiptoe around the house because she doesn't like loud noises and she is super sensitive so I have to really watch what I say or how I say it around her. She has anger bursts too. I also am not allowed to turn lights on downstairs without asking first.

My adoptive Father, on the other hand, has admitted he wasn't overly keen on adopting. He is stubborn and traditional and he mocks everything I do because he doesn't believe in it. He plays by the book and it is the only way for him and I am everything opposite to that. He also doesn't like talking to me much and even closes his door while I am standing there telling him about my day (I am not kidding). I suspect Aspergers and so does some family members but he isn't diagnosed so I can't say for sure. He is emotionally absent in short. 

Lots of issues there, unfortunately."
7,Yup. I see everything... PLEASE STOP THROWING YOURE NUDES IN THE TRASH lol 
8,"Oh wow, that is such a special thing to say. They are so lucky to have you! The system can be so corrupt, but the government neglect the social services so much. Good luck, I wish them all the luck and light in their life :) "
9,"I get that and ""people are dying to see you"" at least 3 or 4 times a week."
10,I do make enough money to live on my own. We used to be an extremely poor family and I changed everything. I pay for the place I stay at with my parents and siblings. Been doing so for 6 years.
11,"In my experience, if your parents are strict and say “you’re not allowed to go out”, I’ve found it easier to sneak out and ask for forgiveness afterwards rather than convince them to give that freedom in the first place. But that being said, I don’t know you or your situation so idk how well the same idea would apply to you "
12,Do you rely on your parents for a place to stay? Do you make enough money to live on your own?
13,(This one)[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ahaeg5/i_am_severely_disabled_and_bedridden_at_only_21_i]?
14,"It sucks dude, especially when you're a bit older and sometimes want to just chill and talk to people know. Not really go through the getting to know someone phase. Or when you got a full time job and are just to tired to go out and meet new people so that eventually you do have those friends to chill with. "
15,What made you want to start an AMA and then go MIA?
16,"I'll be honest OP, this reply has really shaken me up. I feel like my partner and I are destined to become your parents. We're hippie dippy nature types but I have OCD &amp; Anxiety (along with ADHD and depression - all medicated and well managed) and he has Aspergers. We both have planned to adopt a sibling group when I finish school but now I'm beginning to think we'd be bad parents :/"
17,"Yep, that’s it. I’ll DM her the link. Thank you to everyone for the help."
18,What’s the weirdest fetish related item you’ve found and how did you dispose of it in the end?
19,"sorry but you're a fucking idiot.  I'm being toxic but your behavior makes me angry that you could be this ignorant.  You are 20 years old and you keep saying shit like you're ""not allowed to"".  Like that one white kid in middle school who never ever disobeyed his parents, not because of the consequences but because they just had no mine of their own.  The type of kid who says ""fudge"" instead of ""fuck"" when you're hanging out and there's no authority figure in sight.

You need to stop being a pussy and go outside, you are a grown fucking man, your parents do not tell you what you're ""allowed"" to do.

rant over, please downvote away."
20,The problem is that I'm an awful introvert full of social anxiety. I do not have friends either due to living all my life at home. I do not know if I could ever do something like that. I hate being scared/introvert and not being able to step up but it seems almost impossible to me.
21,"Uhh, to be honest if they isolate you to the extent you say they do, and they really give you no choice in the matter, I’d be inclined to call that abusive."
22,Would you say you have a dead-end job?
23,"Stare intensely at her chest and breathe heavily. Lick your lips too.
   
Ask if you can smell her hair.
  
If you have to blow your nose, do a snot-rocket into the nearest trash can.
   
Use the word **cunt** in every other sentence.
   
Ask her if she ever killed a puppy.  When she says no, look down and say you are disappointed.
   
Ask if you can have her drier lint.  Tell her you will use it to make little sculptures of genitals.
   

  
That’s all I have for you at the moment!
  
Good luck!"
24,What do you mean?
25,"Honestly, I ask these questions a lot too. I recently studied child protection and when I went over my papers, I was so shocked at how little went into investigating their own stability. I was getting 'too old' and my Grandad felt that the services were rushing things. My adoptive Mother was investigated after she had hit me and my social worker was worried but that was looked over quickly. It is so bizarre. 
Honestly, thank YOU for letting me tell my story."
26,Jesus.
27,"At the risk of sounding like something from r/wowthanksimcured, giving into fear strengthens it. You won’t magically just stop being afraid, but the more you push forward in spite of it, the more the fear will fade."
28,So basically I was beating a dead horse?   Sorry.
29,"I guess I'm confused about the ""allowed to"" part. You're 20 so you've been an adult for two years and can legally do whatever you want. I don't want to offer advice where none is wanted, but it sounds like you're not happy with the current situation. Do you want to go out into the world or move out on your own? "
30,Can you discuss the issues with your adoptive parents? I'm curious as to what the problems were. 
31,"If you say something weird by accident, try not to be awkward about it, just own it and laugh about it"
32,"Wait.. you sort through the trash for things that can be reused?  That must be disgusting, and interesting all at once."
33,"I'm 20 years old and I still do not have permission to make decisions on my own. I am not really allowed to spend my money over stuff I want to. The social anxiety has been killing me and I know that I would never be allowed to seek a therapist or go to a doctor on my own. I would still be treated like a little boy whose parents would take him with them wherever they want to.

I only ever visit doctor when my parents take me with them. Doing something like that on my own sounds like a dream to me."
34,"I don't even have nude pics to throw away.  The few I have on on my phone, not physical.  And.... sorry about all the diapers.  Especially that one, ugh the chili."
35,"Oh okay. Do they all rely on you for a place to stay? As in, can you move out on your own and they can afford to live on their own? "
36,"I am currently still living with my adoptive parents. Houses are so expensive and I've tried to avoid renting as it's a trap around my area. I am still at university too. I would have moved out for that but I have a cat that I wouldn't have been able to take. Will be leaving as soon as I can! 
My life is surprisingly good! I have learnt that gratitude is a really powerful thing. I have learnt not to be too angry too, I think that helps. I have an amazing partner of 5 years and some really supportive friends. I can't complain too much. I have high hopes! "
37,"I cook, lift weights, read, play video games, and browse the internet. I also sleep about 12 hours a day.

As for supporting myself, I got lucky with stocks and bitcoin. I have enough money to survive forever like this if I wanted to."
38,"I only ever go to doctor when my mom finds it extremely important. Like when I get an extreme fever and she fails to cure it on her own for the first few days. And then it gets worse. So no, I am not sure about autism because I never consulted to doctor. I barely even know what autism is.."
39,My dad also has a job and we all contribute. Yes they can easily live on their own if I move out but I feel like a kid. And imagine how would a 5 years old kid feel if you told them about moving out. That's exactly how I feel because I was NEVER put out in the world. Nor am I allowed to
40,"Military?
"
41,"That sucks, I'm sorry. If you want my two cents, it sounds like your parents are abusive. Maybe not physically, but perhaps emotionally (which can be equally devastating). I think moving out, despite their arguments, would be good for you. You are a functioning adult. You're not 5. They cannot  tell you what to do. Some parent relationships become toxic once their kids grow up because so much of their identities are tied up in being your caretaker. It becomes very toxic when the parents can't accept you as an adult. Lots of people say family is everything; but my experience is that family is often overrated and unhealthy. I cut my parents out of my life years ago due to similar behavior. Even though it was absolutely the right decision, I still felt guilty...which I know is irrational...but yet the feeling exists. Ignore any guilt. It's a trauma response. "
42,*You* need to ask your parents if you don't understand why you're under house arrest. 
43,"That's not a question, that's an answer."
44,"How did they get permission to adopt you with so many psychological problems? Thank you for the AMA, OP!"
45,"What was the most valuable item you ever found, that maybe made you think ""damn, I could make some real money with that""?"
46,"Upvoted for visibility, good luck! "
47,The day went good and we are going out on a second date on Tuesday if anyone wanted to know. we hade allot income and I really think we hade something. thanks for all the kind words and the ones that apparently was from r/neckbeards. =) 
48,Your 20 ? your an adult now legally they can't keep you why do you stay
49,Why aren’t you allowed?
50,Is it possible you are on the Autism spectrum?
51,"You must understand that you have clearly been brainwashed. Are you sure that that is your fault?

You must understand that you should shift the blame to where it belongs; to the people who have brainwashed you. Only then can you start growing."
52,Yup. Im assuming you are as well and probably know the struggle? ha
53,"That actually happens fairly frequently. The company I work for is more of a detective style sort of game, and even our easier rooms have a 50% success rate. I usually manage to make people feel good about it though, I hate when people get down on themselves for being dumb. "
54,"If they were a good murder, I wouldn’t have to show up lol"
55,"This is because you don't go outside and socialise. Your parents have given you a great disservice by emotionally crippling you. In fact, I hope they are not telling you your faults to keep you from leaving.

You might want to check out r/raisedbynarcissists to understand what is going on."
56,Probably American Gangster. I just like Denzel haha
57,"Yes, on faster speeds in fact.  The community has gotten to the point where TTFAF is a trivial song in terms of difficulty to Full-Combo.  I've done it one handed, on 125% Speed, without strumming, and other people in the community have done it on 150% speed."
58,"My husband works at a full on refuse station, he’s seen some messed up shit. Animals pit down from the zoo, race horses that have been put down, loads of fucked shit from the hospitals - he said the old blood bags are the worst because when you roll over them in your earth works machine they pop and splatter blood al over the machines. The police have been there numerous times looking for murder weapons, bodies and all sorts of shit. Not to mention all the chemical waste etc. pretty horrific job actually."
59,I work from home. Left school when I was in my early teens
60,"It was a female Great Dane, pretty much skin and bones, lying in a concrete floor in its own dried up urine and feces in a kennel in an absolutely filthy backyard. I thought it was dead at first, but it opened its eyes and looked at me. I could tell that she was used for breeding. Her puppies were running around the yard. The ones laying still were dead, some corpses fresh, others half rotten. 

We got her and her puppies out, treated them, and I fostered them until a Great Dane rescue heard about her story and wanted to take her. Now, she’s their rescue ambassador! Her pups were all adopted out to good homes."
61,Can I ask why?
62,You know how to do it then. Just go. Your parents are abusive and controlling. 
63,Favorite movie?
64,"Are you sitting by yourself, instead of interacting with the others?"
65,"naked teenages with limited supervision?

&amp;#x200B;

Who the fuck herds that pile of cats?"
66,Does paying a maid to clean your room make you less of a man?
67,Do the animals let you pet them?
68,"Im 19 and work fulltime overnight but don't make enough to move out I'm trying to get  my money up  not really worrying about them anymore. It's hard man always need people to talk too
"
69,Because I'm an awful introvert too shy/scared to do something like that. I do not have the confidence to talk to my parents about it. I have a fear since I was a kid
70,Yay! Go team!
71,Do you have a job or go to school?
72,"You can look up the more official level ASD tests and info here
https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/9y0jpf/aspergers_basic_info_diagnosis_procedures/

Don't take the test as gospel, so to speak. But if you take them, and you top out the score. It's a pretty good indication. I'm trying to get my brother to test out for it at the moment, my mum dropped the ball on us... but she's probably on the spectrum too.

Some parents don't want to face the possibility. Hope you get free bro.  "
73,I wont downvote this. Because it's all true. I'm a pussy and I've just caught a fever to. Things are only getting worse and I hate being a pussy but I am
74,"Getting fit is a great contributor to getting noticed, don’t you think? Might find love when you least expect it."
75,"have you considered building a flamethrower to remove snow

&amp;#x200B;"
76,Do not fuck them
77,"Oh no I'm so sorry. I no way meant anything like ""fuck off"" at all. Only after posting that I am feeling a bit like I was maybe a bit rude? Again, I'm sorry about that because I didnt meant to be rude AT ALL. They asked why am I not allowed and I said ""ask my parents"" because I'm basically trying to say that my parents do not allow me to go out and I have no idea why they do that."
78,"I think it's not just about shyness. For the past 20 years there have been times when I tried to talk to them and tell them I want to go out and it usually turned into a massive argument and mom even hit me when I was a kid. I feel so trapped. I dont want a life like this.

One of the reasons it gets even worse is because I have 3 siblings with me and we are all going through the same. My brother is turning 13 years old this year and he has never been to school his entire life and it makes me cry that I cannot do anything about it. My brother wants to go to school and make friends but I know it will never happen. I just want to die"
79,Why don’t you and the adult sisters move out and get a place of your own?
80,"Actually, I was part of an open adoption so I could still see my Grandad. He has allowed me to keep an idea of all my family members. I recently started to talk to some of my paternal relatives. My biological dad has a brother who is extremely like me! adventurous and very interested in mental health. Unfortunately, a lot of relatives are struggling just as much as my parents. I'd love to trace it back though, my last name was Knight which is quite a significant surname in English history! I also look slightly Mediterranean too"
81,"It's an acronym which stands for ""Not in Education, Employment, or Training."" It's basically someone who doesn't go to work or school and just sits at home all day"
82,"Sorry to hear that, I hope you’re able to overcome your anxiety in the future. "
83,"Have you ever had someone or a group not able to get out of the escape room without help?
"
84,Ah your parents abusive or just controlling? Are you allowed to have contact with the outside world? Do they know you use Reddit?
85,"Personally, I am really not tempted by drugs at all and never have been. A lot of friendship groups I was in experimented with drugs a lot but I never liked the idea of being really out of control. I drink alcohol but not a lot. My brother is 14 and is wrapped in cotton wool so we will see in a couple of years time how that turns out. My sister drinks exccessively, smokes, takes party drugs too. We all have very addictive personalities though. "
86,Have you worked out that your thumb is allergic contact dermatitis yet?
87,"So honestly I used to do this too. Sleep the weekends away because there would be nothing to do and id honestly look forward to work, but I knew the gym was a healthy step and so a friend of mine kept pushing me to go so I did and next thing I knew I just did everything better because of the gym. I’m a big gamer and can be super competitive so I realized that if I went to the gym before a gaming session I’d perform way better. So for the love of my escape (gaming) I would lift before putting in several hours after work. So it’d be Work gym game sleep repeat. As I started going to the gym more all the benefits started hitting me like more confidence, I started seeing results so I wanted to go more just for the results,  girls even took notice and I was kind of hooked. All because I wanted to be a better black ops player lol! And I was tired of watch everyone have something “fun” to do while I slept my life away."
88,"Okay, are you the eldest? How old are your other siblings?
This is abnormal, and obviously it's not good for any of you. 
Where do you live? You need Child Support Services. You need help. Please, let someone help you. You sound powerless in your current situation and you need help to improve things. You are technically an adult now so it needs to happen. "
89,This just seems like a pedophile playground tbh
90,The only answer so far and not even the OP. 
91,I am alone in another country doing a PhD. I feel lonely but instead of overworking I tend to sleep a lot instead. How did you push yourself to go to the gym? Where do you stilll find motivation?
92,Is prostitution legal in your country? Do you have a comfortable life? 
93,"Wow, I think this is the most poetically beautiful response I have even seen on reddit. Well done!"
94,I almost have no contact with the outside world in real life. It makes me feel so weird. No they are not really abusive but they have been controlling all my life. They do know that I use Reddit.
95,okay
96,Will you start answering questions?
97,I agree. This type of restriction and control is abuse. Not all abuse is physical. I’m very sadden by your situation! Do you want to live with them for forever? Do you want out?
98,"Love this question! 

I would say just pour as much love as you can into the child. Make his childhood magical again! My last foster carer's daughter would write to me as a fairy and I would write back and make magical paintings for them. It was also an amazing way for my foster carer and the services to find out how I was really feeling because I could be honest with the fairy. Just be patient, emotions can dip and rise. Give them something to look forward to everyday. Don't shout, discuss and when they aren't listening then never bribe them. Find an alternative way to get them to listen, surprise them with a treat for being good instead of saying ""if you are good today, you'll get this"". Try and make the treat non-material too like an extra hour up or an extra episode of their favourite show. I find that teaching children who come from nothing and may very well go back to nothing that material worth isn't important, then they won't resent their situation. Most importantly, praise them and tell them how proud they should of themselves. It is never too young to teach self love. "
99,"Whoa! Love these! 

How was your experience of the Fostering System? 
I seemed to do well in it. I was put with some extraordinary people. The biggest hurdle was being let down constantly by my parents. I loved them so much, it was heartbreaking. I only had trouble with the first place I was put with (a family member, otherwise known as Kinship care). She had an abusive girlfriend who would shut me in a dark room and found it funny to try and convince me I was a boy. 

Did you understand what was happening and why? 
According to all my files, I was hyper-aware and this really worried services that I was growing up too fast. 

How did you perceive it when a placement ended (anyone's fault? Did you understand what was happening?) 
I read in reports that I would test new placements to make sure they were trustworthy. I would also have night terrors and cry in my sleep. Other than that, I was easily settled. 

How did the idea of being adopted by a new family seem to you at the time (scary living with strangers? 
I was not on board at all with the adoption. I was shown a video tape of my new parents and instantly did not think they were for me. I didn't like their energy but I loved my adoptive Grandmother so much that she really was key in my transition. She would parade me around her seaside town and tell everyone that I was her magical Grandchild who could talk to fairies (I was obsessed with them when I was adopted). This motivated me to want to stay. I was also scared that no other family would want me so I went a long with the questions on how I was doing in my new family. 

where you aware you might live with them short term/long term)
I was always aware of everything. Sometimes this was good, sometimes it was bad. I couldn't be lied to easily. 

How were other foster kids from your point of view e.g. serious issues, normal but misunderstood? 
I was placed in a home with 'special needs' children. I shared the home with autistic children, children with down syndrome and physical disabilities so I always knew there was something different but it didn't bother me. Sometimes, 'special needs' meant really life threatening situations where kids were put with us in emergency. Those were really hard. 

Has it had any lasting effects on you either the fostering or the parents?
It has, I think. I find it hard to receive/show affection. I don't understand family dynamics because I feel I never had parents. My adoptive Mother has made me really anxious about cleaning a lot. There's little things I do that I could put down to my childhood. I was also bullied and I felt that impacted me just as much as my upbringing. 

Will you ever forgive your parents?
I did a long time ago. I love them because they created me and I am so thankful for this existence. They are broken human beings who deserved a better life and are good people deep down. Drugs ruined them. "
100,"A stick, no. A trajectory rod, yes."
101,"It isn't but anyone cares, like the police itself hires prostitutes so it isn't a problem for her, also yes, i have. "
102,I deeply appreciate you saying this especially given the experiences you had with you adoptive parents. I'll try to remember your wisdom when things along this path get complicated.
103,"As a Great Grandma, I ask you, with love in my heart, ""Are you OK""  Can I help you in anyway? ""  Sending you soft, cuddling hugs and offering you a fuzzy blanket."
104,"come on man. listen to what tou are saying. you got a job, just move out already!"
105,"Everyone has 3 sides of their life. Public (what everyone sees), private (what your close friends see) and your personal side that nobody knows about. 

I get to go in and see all 3 sides of someone life and essentially know someone better than their family and friends. 

Most people have sex toys, lots of people have drugs and secret things they don’t want the world to find out about. 

FYI if I find your sex toys, nudes, drugs or secrets I’ll destroy them so your family never knows. "
106,"Gruesome was probably an attempted murder I cleaned up in a store. Buddy got shot in the face and did a race around the store bleeding everywhere. Looked like someone had a bloody mop and dragged it.

Funny was when we were cleaning up a room a chick OD’d in. Had sex toys everywhere. We clean up wearing white suits and gloves. My co worker came up behind me and cracked me in the back of the knee with a giant dick and levelled me.

Strange was when I cleaned up a murder and someone used blood to make satanic symbols on the wall. "
107,I want that more than anything. Why wouldn't I? But my parents do not allow me to go out like when I was 5. Exactly like that.
108,"Because we are all scared. We dont know what to do. How would those kids know what to do who've never been out in the world. If we've ever lived in a place, it's with parents."
109,Honestly living people creep me out far more than dead people
110,I do think so haha mainly because I always feel like I just stand taller and am better than my former self. Always walk out the gym more alpha than when I came in. Lol. 
111,"Don't forget to comment on how beautiful and soft her flesh looks.
"
112,"There was one Saturday night where a coworker and I were taking out the trash. We have an automated front gate that we use a key for to open and close. There’s also a side door. We had gone down to the dumpsters after closing the gate, got a little high, then made our way back up.

At this point, I would like to note that the side door is always locked. 

We get back to the door, and coworker goes for his keys, because he has one for both the front gate and the side door. They’re not there. He turns to me and asks if I have mine, for only the front gate. I go “of course, it’s right here!”

It wasn’t right there. It was next to his keys, inside. 

Naturally, we both panic and run around with our heads cut off. We call our boss, he has no ideas to help immediately. Then I remember our front gate is closed, but not locked. So we head out front, and lift the gate together. It’s a heavy motherfucker, so we can barely get it up. We do though, just enough for me to belly crawl under to get back inside.

Naturally, this is the time someone walks by, and naturally it’s a security guard. I’m on the floor, coworker is holding the gate still, and the three of us all stare before the two of us go “welcome to escape the mystery room!” in unison to the security guard. He laughs, then leaves us be. We got our shit and got out, having never spoken of it since. 

Probably not the funniest, but always the first one I think of. "
113,"Its FlexiOsa, not FlexiosA"
114,Yes I am the eldest. I have two other sisters. 18 and 19. And I do know that it is super abnormal. My sister wanted to go out in the world too. We all wanted to go to school life rest of the people in the world do. We all wanted to go to colleges after that. We all wanted to pursue different careers but instead I watch my siblings sitting at home entire day. I see my sister getting panicked over her situation and being so helpless. I see my brother walking around the home and complaining to my mom that he has nothing to do. And I so wish that I could do something about it but I cannot. Nothing will ever change. I am so sorry. I do not have the confidence to talk to the child support service thing. I am scared. So scared of my mom. I live in Pakistan
115,That would easily be 20x worse. 
116,"*content warning: sexual abuse.* 
The papers were a transcript of an interview the services had with me about my father sexually abusing me. I, as a 5 year old, described in detail what he did and it was so disturbing. MY mind, however, had completely blanked out these events so it was even weirder reading them. I think it is so magical how much my mind protected me. Thank you for giving me time to talk about my life, it means a lot to be heard."
117,"Don't know, don't want to know."
118,"I know it’s hard for you but it sounds like you would really benefit from some friends that could support you and relate to you and encourage you when you’re in need. I’m not sure how the best way to make friends would be since you work/ study from home and can’t go out, but if you can find a way I think it may really help you improve your self esteem and life overall. "
119,I’m not THAT southern 😂
120,Good luck dude hope all goes well 
121,What about a vr headset?  I always thought people stuck in solitary spaces could really benefit from the use of vr.  I personally have a vive that id be willing to share with people like that if the opportunity arose.
122,"No, they aren’t funny. "
123,"So, what did you do all day? And how do you support yourself?? "
124,Save some money up and fucking leave in the middle of the night dude. Seriously. I know you have anxiety but that’ll be because of the situation you’ve found yourself in. Your a grown adult and you don’t need permission to do anything. The sooner you get yourself out in the world the sooner you’ll be a fully fledged adult and you may find yourself becoming a lot less introverted and a lot more social. You can’t be a slave to your parents forever. 
125,"The Clone Hero/Guitar Hero community at this point is focused much less on the aspect of competition, and more on the aspect of personal improvement or entertaining an audience.  As of currently, the best way to determine someone's skill-sets is to browse their own personal accomplishments and make your own assumptions as to who holds that record of ""Best Player"".    


Since this is rather subjective, and anyone's opinion can differ from your own, there's no possibility of having a concrete definitive answer to ""The Best Player"".  I can however provide you with my own personal favorite accomplishment of my own, and links to the other players who're around my skill-level.  


[https://youtu.be/pgi6pATG0fE](https://youtu.be/pgi6pATG0fE) &lt;--- This is my most Recent accomplishment, and by far my favorite so far.

126,"I have just become a foster carer and this weekend I had a young boy come and stay for the first time with me. I am only doing respite care at the moment but I will be looking into long term/permanent care in the future. 

What do you think is helpful for a foster carer to know about welcoming someone into their home that would help you to feel like it’s your home too? Any other advice?"
127,"oof ummm... if anything its more of a yearning feeling for someone else. I'm coming off a relationship and been trying do more me stuff, but sometimes it feels like the more I progress the more I long for someone. Its not super bad during weekdays because I work and I'm mostly busy then, but on the weekends it can be rough if everyone else is busy on dates and whatnot. The stress is more of a confusion, like a ""what do I do now"" type of feeling. I don't know if that makes sense. "
128,I applaud u for making it out congrats and i wish u well i know its hard. Was through something very similar and my sister blames my mother for not allowing us to be adopted by this lovely christian couple when they fostered us. Great to see that others have gone through similar shit
129,Yes. My family and employees get to pet and interact with the ani.als every day.
130,Yep! I see him often! 
131,I have not! Maybe I can attach it to a car and have a mad max sorta whip. 
132,Sweet idea. Take this comment and updoot for visibility. 
133,"Ok! You live in Pakistan! Suddenly your story makes wayyyy more sense. 

Dude, I’m sorry but you’re fucked.....


Just kidding.  Where there’s a will there’s a way. "
134,"&gt; Plenty of staff and volunteer counselors

I'll bet."
135,"No, you are 20 years old. Unless your parents have you tied up, at this point you are the one not allowing yourself. So, why aren’t you allowed?"
136,"A Phoenix must burn before it can rise, my friend!"
137,"It seems your parents are using you as a cash machine, and your social anxiety is only making things worse. One thing you need to really understand and accept is that your family situation is Not Normal and is to an extent Abusive. 

Also your anxiety is caused by you not being in control of yourself and your situation. 

Here is the thing. It will only get worse, both your situation and anxiety, not only for you but for the family aswell, you need to help them by helping yourself. And going to a professional is a good choice. But its gonna be hard for you to take responsibility for yourself if youve never had a say in it before. But once you have control over yourself and are confident in that, nobody can control you. 

But still you Need to let someone in who can help you with this.

Check out the documentary The Wolfpack, its about a family where the kids have not seen the outside world at all, only through movies. 

"
138,Gays have nothing to do with the abuse. 
139,"What were the guidelines about where you sit down with a bare butt? Did you have to carry around a towel?

What amount of clothes were you ALLOWED to wear? Was there a limit? Was nudity mandatory or optional?

How often were people running around in nothing but shoes and socks and a hat?

Was it awesome to go swimming and not worry about a wet bathing suit after?

I sunburn so easy,  would I hate it there?"
140,Im autistic. Not retarded. Of course i did
141,You let your friends bang your mom? That's pretty weird 
142,"Were there any instances of girls menstruating for the first time?

Starting your period whilst you're naked and surrounded by your peers sounds like pure hell"
143,Can you go for a walk? When I was a teenager and lost all my friends because of a bad rumour I just started taking long walks all over town 
144,"Why the fuck do you start an AMA if you don't even answer questions properly, if you wanted us to ask you partents you would tell them to make an AMA, this is us asking questions to you, it's like starting an AMA and then when someone asks something you say ""fuck off mind your business"" "
145,"Not in my opinion.  As of the current moment, my financial situation doesn't exactly allow for this to be a common occurrence, but in the future - if I'm financially stable, You can bet on the fact that I'll be using this perk of luxury much more often.  A disorganized life breeds confusion and unrest, a clean house is a sign of upper-class.  "
146,South Park anyone?
147,"It will take a lot for me to tell you to fuck off haha. I am very curious person too, I would be the same. 

So I have tried a lot. I tried not to give up because I was of the same mind. I recently uncovered some papers that brought up a lot in me. Of course if you'd like to know about that, I'd be happy to answer too. I was so shaken that I thought I'd try to talk about it to my sister, I was met with such bad treatment and I asked her why she always treated me badly and she admitted that she didn't really care for my history. I wish I could say I was exaggerating, it was the most heartbreaking thing to hear. I decided that just because we were related, we didn't necessarily have to *relate*. I am a big believer in boundaries and she was hurting me too much. "
148,What is a NEET? 
149,"OP stop saying sorry to these r/choosing beggars in the comments. It’s an AMA you don’t owe us anything, interesting answers so far, thanks for your time! "
150,"Yeah I’m not asking why your parents don’t want you to go out. “I’m not allowed” isn’t the correct answer to the question. You’re 20. You simply ARE allowed. I was asking why you don’t allow yourself. 

The real answer to why dont you go out, might be “I’m scared due to lack of experience” it might be “I’m financially incapable” (which you’ve said isn’t the case for you) it might be any number of things, but it 100% is not my parents won’t let me. It would probably be good for you to zero in on the actual answer  and use that language instead of saying you don’t leave because you aren’t allowed to, because unless you are tied up, that is not the real or truthful answer. "
151,Are you still in contact with your grandfather? 
152,Jesus?
153,"How often do you get people trying to touch obviously nsft animals

Nsft- not safe for touch"
154,I try to sit on my balcony and read everyday to avoid getting vitamin D deficiency lol
155,How did you decide to become a coroner? And what is the path to your job?
156,"I know that maybe asking this to azoo keeper isnt the best but.. do you really think is good for the animals to be caged like that?  I've been to many zoos and yes, some of the animals are either endangered or rescued but still mos of them just look genuinely depressed."
157,"1. Do your research and evaluate your situation. Getting a pet is a big step, no matter how small the pet. Reading up on animal behavior of a certain pet you want is great. Seek out people who own the kind of pet you want. Also, look at your current circumstances. Do you rent or own? House or apartment? Are you active etc. 

2. Knowing your options. I work with mainly dog rescues, but getting from a reputable breeder is an option as well. Of course, you can get the best of both worlds with a breed specific rescue. Getting from a reputable breeder is just as much help as adopting from a rescue. 

3. (Based on my experience.)Call out asshats, even in your own camp. I frequently criticize the rescue orgs, some of whom I’ve worked for, for being too damn picky, “adopt don’t shop”, and shaming people who get their dogs from reputable breeders. I also call out dog owners for pretending to be wannabe tough-guys with their Doberman or other “dangerous” dog. I call out the control-freak dog owners that have three different collars on their dogs in order to show they’re the alpha. I also call out the overly-tolerant dog owners who insist their dog is friendly even though they’re not. I expect the same from reputable breeders, and others as well for that matter. There are breed specific dog rescues with dogs in them that have pedigrees. What about them? Are reputable breeders really clear from this? Anyway, I sense a rant coming, so I’ll move on. Feel free to en-suite further about this point.

158,I haven’t had any Aboriginal clients personally 
159,"Constantly. Sadly, in situations where people overstep the obvious and/or physical barriers, the animals ultimately deal with the consequences. We strive every day to prevent this situation."
160,"I love conversations like these because they offer perspective so dont worry. Over the years, I think our personalities clashed a lot. She is very slow and steady with life, I guess. She lacks motivation in anything and is more interested in getting wasted with friends and climbing the social hierarchy. She is always surrounded by drama and is a very negative person. I know all of these traits are growing from deep-rooted anger and frustration in life. I know she hates that a lot of attention was put on me because I suffered every abuse you can think of and I was in such a life-threatening position. As soon as my sister was born she was placed under the guardianship of a family friend so she avoided a lot of it. She didn't avoid other emotional disturbances that comes naturally with adoption. I understood all of this and I tried to always be supportive towards her, I drove to her in times of need and I was already available to her. I thought just answering whatever she threw at me with love would work but it didn't so I responded with anger too, thinking it would be a release for her but she would just block me for months and then turn up again. I stopped asking to meet up, however, because I would turn up at her house or I would message her asking what time and she will tell me she can't make it anymore. Also, when I saw her she would hardly talk to me and would sit on her phone.   
I think she is hurting and is angry. But I can't keep sacrificing my own happiness for her. She has a family where she is and she always throws in my face how much she loves them when we fall out. I am happy to set boundaries because she has that environment around her. If she was in danger, alone and struggling then I would be out there helping her, no matter what.   
I am so sorry this is so long"
161,"Yeah man just gotta keep grinding honestly. Just gotta remember to suffer now a little bit for that extra financial freedom later and trust me its SOOOO worth it. Once you got your money right and you enter your mid 20s, you are already way ahead of the pack. Gotta try to figure out how to throw in some socializing in there too because you cant just work work work. You'll burn out. "
162,"First, thanks so much for what you do. The things you see can't be easy, but you're helping to make a difference in these poor animals lives, and that's wonderful.

My question - what can we do to help? There's adopting animals in need if you're able to, and donating to organizations, but is there anything else you'd suggest?"
163,"My grandpa started with some normal farm animals like a donkey and sheep and just grew from there. He was always good with animals and training horses so he just wanted more challenges and my dad took over and now I'm learning the ropes on the business side and grew up with the animal side of it.
I plan to be here till the day I die. I have lived here my whole life and would not be able to leave it if I tried."
164,"Nope, 100% non sexual, any sexual behavior will get you kicked out real quick. "
165,Kylie.
166,"I know why people say it's weird, but once you get that sex is completely different than love (i know it's obvious, but some people really have problems to differentiate) then it's not that weird, it's awkward maybe but she's a ""professional"" in the way she refers as them so i really don't have a problem, i mean, it's her sexual life, not mine. "
167,The only thing it affects is when you are out with your buddies and everyone is talking about work and you can’t cause it freaks people out. 
168,Sorry to hear about your past. Now that you are 23 are you living alone or with your adpoted parents? How is your life going based on your lack of good parents?
169,"&gt;What were the guidelines about where you sit down with a bare butt? Did you have to carry around a towel?

Any public area carry and sit on a towel, except like the sides of the pool. 

&gt;What amount of clothes were you ALLOWED to wear? Was there a limit? Was nudity mandatory or optional?

It's a 'clothing optional' place, so technically as much or little as you want, quite a few of us stayed in underwear for a little while at the start which was fine, but if you were still in full street clothes hours later they'd probably have a chat with you. 

&gt;How often were people running around in nothing but shoes and socks and a hat?

Pretty much all the time, nudity was just the norm, once I got nude I didn't wear anything but shoes and a hat for the whole time I was there!

&gt;Was it awesome to go swimming and not worry about a wet bathing suit after?

It was awesome being able to just jump in and out whenever, and just walk around drying off in the sun. 

&gt;I sunburn so easy, would I hate it there?

Get some strong sunscreen and you'd love it there!

170,You're not a real man if you can't keep your place clean on your own. That's why I live in 5x6 plastic shed that I can just hose off in between binges.

173,"The note is always photographed and documented otherwise. But I'm not going to give an 8 year old a note from mommy that says ""I hope you don't turn out as fucked up as me"". "
174,How do you mentally deal with examining children that have died?
175,Many times children who come from parents with drug and alcohol addictions tend to have some of the same issues. Do you or have your siblings ever had drug or alcohol addictions? If so please elaborate. 
176,Can you do through the fire and flames on expert though
177,Do you this changes how you look at sex?
178,Have you ever wanted to take an ancestry test? Maybe you have more family out there that you can connect with. 
179,Have you suscribed to PewDiePie?
180,"I mean, maybe? I don't know haha. I don't really know how you don't look molesty lol. Nonetheless, they really misjudged them. To be honest, when applying to adopt you have to get someone to back you up and vouch for you. The people who did that knew exactly how they were and yet still painted them perfect "
181,Oh..you got an AFRICAN African. Go you
182,My prayer goes to your mom
183,"It's 2 bedroom 2 bathroom, I just use the spare room for my computer and stuff. Can't remember the square footage though.

I meant to look into sailboats, thanks for reminding me :)"
184,"Woah with this additional info, when combined with the fact that they control your spending... seems they are keeping you their for their own financial means...
I know this is probably very intimidating and scary, but this really sounds like abuse.  If you know you have the means to be self-sufficient, you’ve enough tools under your belt to work on getting out.
The quality of your life depends on it. I hope some Redditors will be able to provide some good advice on how to avoid their notice in order to do so.  Best of luck- I truly hope you can find your way out."
185,"There are no rules pertaining to that. Sometimes I will dispose,of a suicide note if I think it's going to ruin someone's life. And a surprising amount of people die while having sex, and not always with their spouse. When that happens I simply tell the family that the person died of a cardiac event at X location. I don't mention that they were having sex unless for some circumstantial reason I have to."
186,"i don't talk to him anymore. i don't resent him like i used to, but i realized i should just keep my distance from him for my safety and sanity."

188,Probably cat. They are the better predators.
189,I would say I'm pretty happy
190,"You said you can afford to do it? You buy food, you pay rent, you pay utilities.....just do it. Find an apartment online and apply for it. "
191,I just did the biggest facepalm. I'm sorry.
