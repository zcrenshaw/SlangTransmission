0,"I studied accounting at Illinois. I had gone through 4 years of problems in college and a couple months ago my thoughts went from contemplating suicide to actually doing it. This was the only time in the last 2 years where I felt like someone or something was protecting me from dying. I know that sounds weird, but last night between the massive lacerations all around my neck and me biting a piece of my tongue of, being alive has never felt this good to me in a while. I can’t remember what even happened after I pushed the chair from my feet because I blacked out very quickly, but when my eyes opened as I’m thrashing on the ground with a tight cable still choking me, it made me realize how precious and priceless life really is. I don’t care if I fuck up anymore in the future, because I don’t want to experience the feeling of almost dying again."
1,"So, just a quick word of warning (though I do hope you continue having the will to live)...lack of oxygen to the brain can create a euphoric high. The neurotransmitter imbalance that almost certainly led to the episode of depression you were experiencing was likely temporarily cured. Key word being TEMPORARILY. 

Please seek out a psychiatrist ASAP as depression is a terrible soul stealing monster and you are currently experiencing a moment of clarity. Antidepressants work. If you’ve been on them before and had issues, take note of the exact medication and tell your doctor. Each antidepressant can be different. Something that worked for one person may not work for you and vise versa. 

Mental illnesses lie to your rational self. You may be fine for years and suddenly it creeps back into your life. I hope you do not have to battle it for a lifetime but there are plenty of us out there that do so just remember that no matter what your brain tells you, you’re not alone."
2,"Mostly because of religious reasons, but also because I was scared and didn't tell anybody so I didn't have any support. I was young, naive, and stupid and by the time I realized I was pregnant it just seemed like the right thing to do for me personally. 

While I support EVERY woman's decision to have an abortion (despite the circumstances) it's just not something I could personally go through with. However, I honestly think it would have been less traumatic for everybody involved."
3,"Is it true that back in the day, women used to lay eggs rather than do live births?"
4,Very happy to hear that you are alive. What do you mean by eye opening experience? How did this change your perspective? What did you study in college?
5,"Not really a desire to keep the baby because I was young, unprepared, and had different plans for my life. Also, since the baby was a product of rape I had no connection to the father (obviously). 

I did enjoy holding her and looking at her after she was born (she was beautiful) but was relieved when she went home with her new family. I knew they would give her a great life."
6,"What one thing do you wish people knew about you? (Upvote and fist bump for getting clean, BTW 🤜)"
7,"Do you know that most people quit a month in? Do you also know that’s not gonna be you? Do you know that you’re gonna post again in a year ? 


I do"
8,"👊. It would be cool if people knew that I'm not nearly as scary as I seem. I'm tall, white, and covered in Scandinavian tattoos, so people seem to think I'm a neo nazi. And I'm usually wearing  a death metal shirt and Hoodie, so when I walk up behind people, they usually get pretty freaked out. I'm definitely a weird guy, but unless I'm being verbally or physically attacked, I'm a pushover. Probably because I have autism."
9,Dude I'm literally sitting here trying to pass the time because I have the same problem lol
10,"Before I retired three years ago, I was at a Silicon Valley Venture Capital fund, so yeah, I would say so"
11,"Yeah. I used to have an extremely high sex drive when I was younger and it has been diminishing since my mid 60s, but I still do have some sex."
12,"I get 200$ a month from the state government. I was born with autism and epilepsy. I also went blind in 2010, but regained 35-40% of my vision. My mom is a junky, and did every drug in the book while pregnant. She started giving me pain pills when i was 17, so i never really had a chance to aclimate to being an adult properly.My dad was an outlaw biker. Now he's just an angry old man, but I still love him unconditionally. And I have a serious case of clinical depression."
13,"Thanks so much for all that advice. I am going to seek professional help for sure. The lack of oxygen made me feel the highest I’ve ever been in my life not gonna lie, but it was a scary scary high"
14,"What made you decide not to have an abortion? Does your rape have any affect on your feelings for your baby? Did you keep the baby or give it up for adoption?

I'm very sorry to hear about your ordeal, by the way. Nobody should have to go through that."
15,"Touching in bikini areas is not allowed, and I am trained in Aikido, so I'm fairly good at redirecting energy and intention. Most clients (usually about mid 40s males of all races) typically try to get away with more, but I remind them that's not the service they are paying for. 

I haven't had sex with a client yet and don't really intend to, but there are some things I would do that are outside the realm of cuddles for a much higher hourly rate."
16,"I am a middle school teacher in SoCal.  I do have a few 10-12 year-old students who are fasting for their first time, including water. 

What suggestions do you have that might help me support them during school hours, especially when snack/lunch time rolls around?  Thank you."
17,"You still use proper punctuation, so you have that going for you."
18,"The first step was meeting with local anti-trafficking organisations to learn as much as I could about the regional situation. Trafficking networks operate differently depending on the region and the type of trafficking, and the techniques used are constantly evolving so the traffickers stay ahead of their targets. At first it seemed that my only hope was an extremely slim one - to identify the traffickers who had taken my friends, and to learn where they'd sold the girls. I was very fortunate that one of the girls was actually able to get a phone and call home to Vietnam while I was in the region, so once I'd acquired that phone number, I had something to work with. Even after I was able to contact the girls, though, it was a very long process of trying to locate them - they'd both been taken to distant regions of China, couldn't read Chinese, and had very little idea where they were"
19,"All I really felt was fear, not attachment."
20,"Assuming you dont have sex with your clients, how do you draw that line? Are they respectful of your boundaries?

What demographic do most of your clients make up?"
21,"Well sometimes I see shadow people or random animals.
Sometimes I see bugs.
And often I hear people talking, for hours."
22,I have a cellphone. And 4g LTE...
23,"I didn’t know I was pregnant or what was going on, and I blocked out most of the procedure, which was better for me I guess. I only realised it’s an abortion a couple months ago. I thought it was another way he abused me lol"
24,"I went through some rough years in college. Freshman year my gf’s roommate had a baby and murdered it in the bathroom as we were standing outside the bathroom trying to hear what was happening, that started college off in a rough way. Financially I’m in debt from student loans and I have been struggling to have any money in my account the last couple years. I also have been taking OxyContin for the past 2 years after I slipped a disk in my back, and I have been addicted to it ever since. My gf of 3 years broke up with me, I was failing tests, I had no money, and I was going through heavy opiate withdrawals because I couldn’t afford any. If you want more ducked up stories from college tho I had at least 3 more super shitty things go down the last 4 years. Flooded my whole second floor of my apartment building after hitting a pressure gauge in the stairwell and it burst open. I was fined 4500$ and was evicted. My car was stolen from the basement of my apartment building as well... I was stalked for a full month by a insane girl who would drive laps around my apartment to see if I was home. The list goes on and on honestly..."
25,What happens if you live somewhere where the sun doesn't set? When do you get to eat?
26,Do you still have sex?
27,Can I ask about the steps you took for your investigation? What trails did you follow? Did you unearth a trafficking ring? If so how do you know if it was all the same organisation of people?
28,"Pay as you go. So basically, I walk to the metro pcs store and pay my bill."
29,"Do you think you could build 1,000 ships in a fortnight to strengthen the Iron Fleet?"
30,"Good question. Honestly it sounds cliche, and it's not one memory, but the time I met and chased after my now-deceased wife. At the time I was a doctoral student, partly due to being interested in economics and partly to avoid the Vietnam draft. I still kind of wanted to be a professional musician (although when push came to shove I became a trader instead), and would always try to use my guitar to try to pick up girls at college. She was actually a student in a class I was teaching at the time, but I didn't want to put any undue pressure on her, so I waited until the end of the semester and then started flirting with her. Fun times."
31,"I'm 29. And I've been addicted to heroine, diluaded, methadone, alcohol, and methamphetamine. But I've been clean for a while now, except that I'm on suboxone."
32,That's why I'm speaking out now! I think it's important to share my story in light of everything that's happening in our country.
33,Absolutely. Probably even more so now.
34,"So usually during lunch time would be time for mid-day prayer which takes about 5 mins to perform. I would suggest give them a place for them to pray. Apart from that, from experience as a Muslim we appreciate not everyone is fasting and will eat in front of you, just hope no one is being forced to sit there and watch other people eat."
35,...YOUR MOM MAKES SENSE!!!
36,"OP - You sound like a very strong, confident woman. It’s very admirable."
37,"Honestly, I haven't tried in a long time. I'm extremely shy around people I don't know. And I have a difficult time understanding instructions. My vision is terrible too. But the biggest reason is, my addiction has fucked up my brain. I have absolutely no drive at all. I'm really depressed, so it's difficult for me to even make myself look presentable. I know how worthless I am, but I'm at the point where my brain won't create dopamine and serotonin properly, so everything seems pointless."
38,Damn this sounds risky af
39,How are you posting on reddit?
40,Exactly the point of choice.  You had a choice and made the right one for you.   I'm sorry you went through what you did.  Thank you for speaking out and i hope you have the love and support you need/ want now.
41,Nice. Glad I’m not the only one lol
42,"I had one kid who was really good at doing the Lester the molester voice. Like shockingly good. My most favorite tho was one we had for weeks, this guy would disguise his number somehow (not blocked), and call for a variety of reasons, fake sales calls, etc. but every phonecall at the end he would just say “okay one last question, do you sella de porno?” Got me every time."
43,Worse. Now I can't make eye contact with people at all.
44,"At a supermarket I was wandering around half asleep, a restaurant, a cinema and school probably all the weird places haha."
45,"1. I would like to say a lot of things to those lawmakers. But mostly that forcing a woman who was raped to carry a baby to full term is wrong. Even though that's the path I chose, I believe any woman in this situation should be able to choose what is best for her. It's been over ten years since this happened and it still very much affects my life. I still deal with the trauma every single day. I have no doubt the child still deals with the trauma every single day. My now husband and family deal with the trauma every single day. It never goes away and this was MY choice. I can't imagine how bad it would be if I wanted to abort but wasn't legally allowed to. For what it's worth, I didn't realize I was pregnant until after the six week mark.

2. I personally believe life begins when the fetus is viable outside of the womb. So somewhere around 22-25 weeks."
46,"Yes, if the client wants to talk. Most don't unless it's a long session. (I do overnights as well.) We can watch a movie together, but I prefer very active cuddling, which takes all my attention.

The minimum cuddle is 90 minutes, and I do up to 12-hour overnights. 

I usually set the thermostat a little colder than usual because the room gets hot quickly with all the snuggling. I also pile the bed with a plethora of blankets."
47,"I remember some of it, though they’re not in chronological order, and the others are blocked out. 

It started when I was 5 or 6. He’d always been emotionally unstable, and I’ve learned to obey him from a very young age in order to survive. 

I don’t remember the first half, but I’ll try my best to describe what I remembered. I felt indescribably crucial pain, then blood coming out of my vagina. I bled a lot I thought I would die. I didn’t know at all what was going on. I wanted to cry but was petrified to cuz he hated seeing me cry. After god knows how long he finally stopped, then told me to wash the bloody bed sheet because “I made this mess”. It hurt soooooo much couldn’t even move! Well after a while I dragged myself to wash it. Then he hugged me, I felt so weird cuz he never showed such affection. He looked like he’s happy with me so I plucked up my courage and asked him why he did this. He said it’s because he loved me. I told him it reallyyy hurt, almost crying. He told me if I relax it wouldn’t hurt, and that it’ll get better. I then lie in bed for the rest of the day. My stomach hurt so much that I didn’t even feel hungry. Mum was working overseas and wasn’t home for almost a week. My dad didn’t have a job."
48,"It's hard to explain, but it's like when you see a bug on the ceiling and you go ""is that really a bug? Or just a hole?""

I see these black shapes that look like bugs and my brain goes ""yep, that's a bug, here's your anxiety"""
49,"I have heard that most people quit a month or two in, and it’s not going to be me because I’m stuck in this gym contract for two years (I could cancel for a few if I wanted), and I’m not paying for it just for it to sit there. Also, a friend (who is most assuredly NOT overweight and just wants to buff up some since he’s pretty small) got his membership at the same time I did, so it’s kinda a together thing, even though we don’t go together."
50,"I began the investigation with my own preconceptions about human trafficking, which I suppose I'd picked up from films or overly-simplified stories in the media. 

I saw human trafficking as quite a simple issue, involving criminals and their victims. The reality turned out to be so much more complex (and fascinating) - I guess that was the most surprising thing I learned. 

In China, I came face-to-face with my friend's ""husband"" - the man who had forced her into marriage. In Vietnam, I know people from the girls' own community who were working as insiders, essentially selling their own friends to the traffickers. 

In Indonesia, I met a man who seemed to be procuring local girls for brothels in Malaysia, although in that case I had no proof and no time to investigate"
51,"What's something you enjoy?

This second part isn't a question but I want to let you know that it can get better. My SO and I are both in recovery and he was homeless when I met him, and I'd had my share of couch surfing or car sleeping. We're coming up on 5 years clean and in that time we've both purchased cars, taken care of our legal messes, gotten stable jobs in healthcare, signed up for shit like health insurance, and are looking at our first home together now. It isn't easy and sometimes I feel like I'll never measure up or get ahead, but even one good day outweighs the bad ones. I just got through an elective minor surgery, and next step is some dental work if I can afford it. I'll never ever claim it's as easy as ""just doing it"", but if you want it, it can be done."
52,are you tech savvy
53,"The site I cuddle through reminds people that that's a normal thing to happen, and they suggest changing positions or taking a minute to calm down. 

All of my clients have gotten one, and I just make sure I have a hip or a leg or an arm in the way. I also offer to leave for 15 minutes or so if they want to take care of it themselves."
54,What sort of hallucinations?
55,If only more people thought the way you do
56,Did you want the procedure and did you understand what was happening?
57,I see many people on reddit say they have or had jobs like this in the past. It sounds awesome. I’m always getting jobs where they keep us short staffed and busy as fuck.
58,did you feel any attachment to the baby while you were pregnant?
59,"Ordinary cuddling is typically passive and there's not a lot of movement. Active cuddling is where one or both people are moving (rubbing arms, touching chests, entwining toes or legs) pretty much the whole time. I think it's far more intimate than passive cuddles but also more fun and engaging. 

I have heard of the cuddle mattress but don't really have an opinion."
60,"Um... Being topless perhaps. Or leaving space for more sexual touch, but I'm not interested in actual sex acts."
61,"Physical health problems, coupled with logistical problems with my research started it.  My funding was running out soon.  My mental health was in a downward spiral.  It was a really bad time."
62,"According to scholars, it's either eat according to the nearest country where sun sets, or according to Mecca's time, tho this one is debated a lot and the former is generally more accepted"
63,Strangest place/time you've fell asleep?
64,"You seem like what we called a crusty in the midwest. Huge, tattooed, scary looking dude outside the metal show. Nice as can be if you've the balls to start a conversation with though, and a longshot smarter than the guy in the sleeveless cannibal corpse shirt.  Who is the best live band you've seen?"
65,Do you talk about stuff while you cuddle? Or watch Harry Potter? How long do you usually cuddle for? What do you do if you are cold and your client is hot? Who decides what to do with the thermostat?
66,"He died around a year after the abuse was discovered. Nobody knows I had an abortion, though."
67,"I spent three months teaching English in their hometown (Sapa, Vietnam). They used to sit on the corner of my street selling handicrafts to tourists. I saw them every day, we became friends, and stayed in touch on Facebook. 

After I left Sapa, I received messages that some of the girls had been kidnapped. At first I didn't do anything, because the whole thing seemed so huge and overwhelming I didn't know where to start, or what I could possibly do. 

Then I got into a difficult situation in my own life, which made me realise what a difference a good friend can make. I realised it was better to try and fail than not to try at all. That's how the project started"
68,"Can I offer some advice? There will come a time when you don’t feel like training and you’ll decide as you’ve gone kids recently that you deserve a break. I cannot stress enough, go anyway!

I think it was Terry Crews who said that if you don’t feel like training, just go and sit in the gym cafe or just do a bit and then go home. Skipping the gym even once means there’s something like an 80% chance you’ll stop going altogether shortly after.

Good luck and never forget how good going to the gym makes you feel!"
69,"We did unearth a transnational trafficking ring in the course of the investigation, which was taking teenaged girls from Vietnam and selling them across China. Most of the people in that ring were ultimately imprisoned in either Vietnam or China, though I wasn't personally involved in that process"
70,"Thanks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, the 50s for me was pretty vanilla, although that could just be me looking back on my childhood after living through some *very* interesting decades (60s in general, 80s in wall street). Overall, it was a good decade to grow up for myself personally, because it allowed me to really grow up in a relatively peaceful time. The one thing I remember a lot is Cold War hysteria.

&amp;#x200B;

The 60s were another thing entirely. Ironically, right when I entered my teen rebellion phase (I was 14-15 when the 60s started), the decade of rebellion began. I was a big fan of JFK and tried to look, dress, and act like him. I was devastated when he died. It was really overall a mixed decade for me. On one hand, I did a lot of stuff that could be considered 'counterculture' or 'hippy': I was in a band, I was against Vietnam, I was into weed and LSD. On the other hand, I did some pretty 'mainstream' stuff: got a PhD, went into finance, voted for Nixon (I voted for Johnson in 64, but as I mentioned, I hated the Vietnam war). Essentially, I started to enjoy the 60s, but as time went by I basically dropped a lot of stuff I enjoyed to be part of the mainstream. I love finance, but there was always a part of me that wanted to travel, party, and have fun again. That side of me came out mostly in the 80s, after my wife died (car accident)."
71,"Hey, I’m a Muslim as well. Normally, we would follow an app (Muslim Pro or others) which tells us the time for break fast, which is coincidentally one of the prayer times (Maghrib time) in our 5 prayer times. More accurately, I would rely on that app if I were to travel to a new place as it provides me an accurate timing and so forth.  In some places, the days are longer, so they would have to pray for long period of time."
72,I definitely chose to keep the baby to term and absolutely appreciated having the ability to make that choice for myself.
73,"Thats the point of pro CHOICE. pro choice does not mean pro abortion, it means every woman should choose what is best for her and her body and her fetus. I think its great that you made the choice you did, but amy choice would hage been good because only YOU should be able to make that choice. I'm sorry for everything you went through, you are very strong and i wish you the best from now on ❤"
74,That's why it costs so much.
75,How do you make money? What made you homeless?
76,"This has honestly changed over the course of the past 10+ years. We have a semi-open adoption. At the beginning I got lots of pictures, etc. but as time goes on I have found myself wanting to distance myself more. I have my own family now and the realization that this could hurt my children someday is terrifying."
77,"I just wanted to thank you for this post.  My Mom was raped as a teenager and she kept me.  We are very close and she is an amazing Mom.  Now I'm a Mom with two gentle, loving teenagers... it was the right choice for her as well and I get to live this beautiful life."
78,"Good questions. First few days I was probably eating about the same I would have at dinner time or maybe little bit more. However as it goes along, eating the same amount is a lot harder, I would say 50% less then what I was having before, I know this because usually I wouldn't have a problem demolishing jacket potato, cheese and beans but yesterday I was full with half the potato."
79,"I injoy listening to technical death metal, and playing the drums. And thank you for your encouragement."
80,Dad
81,"I try to avoid the woods because I have extremely poor vision. And I think the government should set aside money for a program. Build houses, but require that people make an effort in order to live there. Have the drug addicts take u.a.'s, and get in some sort of treatment. When you fail a u.a. take away privileges, but don't kick them out unless they really fuck up. Make cheaper, smaller houses for the people who refuse to stop using. Like tiny. But charge them a small amount every week to stay there. And to stop the places from becoming drug dens, lock up anyone caught selling. And decriminalizing all drugs, and privatizing them. So the government makes money, the cartels Gtfo, and the people who choose to use are safer."
82,It's a pretty big risk for me to meet with strangers who may think I offer sex.
83,"I did, when I started having them

I take meds everyday but they don't help that much with this particular problem.

I still take them because they help with other symptoms"
84,Yeah my heart was aching so much recalling that.
85,"No, the baby was adopted by a wonderful family that I chose."
86,"In China, as in many parts of Asia, when a woman gets married, the husband and his family pay a bride price to her family. The traffickers pretended to be the girl's family, and took the bride price. The ""husbands"" didn't realise they were getting girls who had been kidnapped from Vietnam. 

Having said that, they didn't really care, either"
87,What the fuck is wrong with people
88,Not a question but some advice... Use this time to learn whatever skills you will need for the next step up. You should have access to some pretty knowledgable people... Go chat with them. Figure out how this company works.
89,"It’s a large shipbuilding company, USA"
90,Who was your rapist?
91,"Pretty much a must in Wall Street, at least is was in the past. I haven't been on Wall Street since the 90s, so might have changed."
92,"Thank you, I appreciate that. 

That was one of the surprising discoveries along the way - as strange as it might sound, the ""husbands"" had also been tricked by the traffickers, and were not aware of what they were doing. 

As I've said in the film, they weren't innocent, but they were ignorant"
93,Where do you pay for it if they can't mail the bill to you or a conputer to pay it on?
94,"I know a few who claim to be homeless, but I can't exactly take their word for it. Autistic people are definitely prone to homelessness. There are a lot of factors to consider. As long as you try your best to make sure your son is as well adjusted as possible under the circumstances, I wouldn't worry. I'd keep an eye out for the time right around the end of high school. To much freedom can be way to much to handle by yourself, so you may need to push him to progress. That was my problem. After high school, there wasn't anybody telling me what to do, so I just kinda fucked around. But my case is different because my home situation was so shitty."
95,Would you still consider yourself pro-choice?
96,"Yo be very careful homie, I had a mate with mild  schizophrenia that absolutely lost it, he was able to distinguish between real and not until one tab of LSD. 

Stay safe OP."
97,Not yet. They seem to prefer being teased. Lol.
98,Well damn. Good job getting clean from everything else.
99,"I majored in English with minors in psychology and religious studies. I have a few published books, so the degree still paid off. 

For the last few years, I have been in priestess and doula training learning about sacred touch and sexuality.

If you ever find yourself in Portland, I can do cuddles for you! I cuddle through Cuddle Companions, and they have cuddlers all over the world."
100,what business and country?
101,"If I'm sleeping, I prefer big spoon. I prefer switching when cuddling whenever I get tired. A surprising amount of clients just want to hold or massage me, which is awesome."
102,"Boredom. I retired three years ago after a pretty crazy and off-the-rails career. I've honestly been doing something exciting, for better or worse since my late teens/early twenties (I wanted to be a musician, went to college and got hooked on economics, went to grad school honestly just to avoid the draft, and have worked in finance since) and don't know what to do with the free time."
103,"There's a local human trafficking crisis in that region (Sapa). China's ""one-child"" policy led to a massive shortage of women in China, and these girls were from a poor (and poorly-educated) ethnic minority community very close to the Chinese border. 

I later learned that those girls in particular had been targeted because one of their friends was working as an insider, essentially selling them to the traffickers"
104,How did the drugs effect your autism? Make it worse? Better?
105,"I haven't had a client I haven't enjoyed cuddling yet. My first overnight was a little rough because I couldn't sleep, but I got through it. They weren't really paying me to sleep anyway. 

I really enjoy learning what different styles of bodies enjoy and interacting with people who are genuinely starved for affection. Giving people what they want is really rewarding for me."
106,"I accidentally told her maybe a month after the sexual abuse started. She basically said I was lying(she loved dad too much), and threatened me to never mention this again. Then dad somehow knew I told mum and he was mad at me too. It was horrible. I never told her or anyone again."
107,Definitely Aborted. I saw them about a month and a half ago.
108,"Don't you think it would make more sense to allow water?

Also, what are your thoughts on people who have been hospitalised because of Ramadan (over eating/drinking)?"
109,"We are supposed to wear at least a t-shirt and shorts, but I frequently wear tank tops and comfy pants. My clients typically feel most comfortable getting down to their underwear."
110,"Shit dude I’m so sorry, I’m your age and go to Illinois too, I remember the baby story. Glad to hear you’re alive, hang in there!"
111,"If you have psychotic symptoms you should probably stay away from any psychedelics or any drugs for that matter the risk of getting stuck on a trip is bigger than for anyone else according to my psychoatrist 
I hope you do okay and have a nice day bud"
112,You're not worthless! And you write really well!
113,"Would you still donate blood ifnit was used to feed vampires? (they will starve without donor blood, not hunt)

What are your favorite and least favorite ice cream flavors?"
114,Why did you quit?
115,Like what?
116,Me too but unfortunately I'm a temp so this has my anxiety through the roof.
117,I am polyamorous and have a husband and a girlfriend who live with me. They are also both signing up as cuddlers. Lol.
118,"the first time i took an opioid, a friend (at the time) offered it to me. they had some prescribed xanax, and gave me a couple to “take the edge off”. i was hooked almost immediately, and began buying from them. when they said they had no more to offer me, i went in to the doctor to get my own prescription. still not enough. that’s when i discovered Tramadol, which i knew my mom was taking and had copious amounts of. i could easily take 5-10 blister packs at a time without making a dent in her stash (she got them online from an out-of-country source, i later discovered). each pill was 50 mg, and i started out with one or two a day, then 2 in the morning, two at night, then 4, 6, 8, etc etc. in one stage of my addiction, i was taking about 5-6 in the morning before school, a couple during break, a couple after school, then between 6 and 8 before bed. still not enough. when i dropped out of school, that’s when i got into the “heavier stuff” (although i wouldn’t say taking 8+ Trams at a time isn’t serious by any means). i was on opioids at all times, getting my hands on anything i could from “plugs” i had found. i mixed it with weed as well. ironically, i actually sold Tram to make money for this. i did this for about a year before my OD, so from 17-18."
119,"Yeah, I'm aware. I've looked up the laws and am safely on the right side of them."
120,"I'm on a housing list, so hopefully I'll have a place to live. I'm staying away from drugs too. And I'm on an antidepressant."
121,"I wasn’t raped but I got pregnant and I didn’t want to be a mother. I’m extremely pro choice and considered abortion. After talking to my doctor I realized I would rather carry the baby to term and that was the right decision for me. 

That said I will defend a woman’s right to choose until my last breath. I always assumed I would get an abortion if needed, but when I didn’t it was completely my body and my choice and the only other person who had a right to an opinion in the matter was my doctor. 

That is how it should be for every woman in every situation. Goddess bless you for posting your story :-)"
122,They're all pretty lazy esp the pug who spends the most time with me and sleeps on my bed at night so they normally will just cuddle up with me when I feel the need to sleep which I like :D
123,"They were taken by deception. They were targeted by young men who came to town and built up relationships with the girls over a period of weeks or even months. 

All the traffickers needed was enough trust from the girls for the girls to get on the back of their motorbikes, then they could take them out of town and across the border, which was only a short distance away"
124,"&gt; a cinema

That's actually a pretty normal place to fall asleep depending on what's playing."
125,"I mean, they're basically paying me not to do that, so I don't let it happen. But they can still want to. That's fine."
126,"It’s weird and tough to explain because I’ve never been super close with religion or anything, but it made me feel like it wasn’t the right time for me to go. Like god or something made sure the cable snapped and that I made it through it all. It was probably just luck, but I actually feel like fate had a hand in this and I’m not one to believe that stuff really"
127,I'm a first generation vietnamese refugee who got to Australia. I commend you on the work you've done.
128,"&gt; I personally believe life begins when the fetus is viable outside of the womb. So somewhere around 22-25 weeks.

I'm a mom, and this is how I feel too.  A NICU nurse posted not long ago and said pretty much the same thing.  Having seen babies born too early in that 22-24 week window and seeing the parents decide whether to let them go or try life support (which may only extend the inevitable and prolong the agony).  Only the mother can make the decision.  It's a fetus vs a baby when mom says it is."
129,"she hasn't answered, so probably"
130,"&gt;hey will starve without donor b

Good question... If vampires where simply people who needed blood to feed on (not the Stoker kind devilish hunter of virgins) then sure! It would be like donating to the local food bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about it, a blood bank for a vampire IS a food bank"
131,Professional cuddlers are welcomed into the sex worker community where I’m from. I wouldn’t call you a sex worker but you face similar risks
132,"What is ""active cuddling""? How does it differ from ordinary cuddling?

Have you heard of the cuddle mattress? Do you have an opinion about it?"
133,Ever made out what was said? Or what language these people were speaking in? Could you explain a little more what you mean by Sometimes you see bugs? Thanks have a good day
134,"That's awful. Have you tried getting a job, and how did that go? Are most employers reluctant to hire?"
135,"I heard your music tastes are solidified in your 20s, and I was in my 20s during the mid-60s to mid-70s. I like the Rolling Stones, Led  Zeppelin, and Queen."
136,What if someone gets an erection?
137,Do your dogs react in any way to when you fall asleep suddenly?
138,"Oh, hey, you're the guy who slept with a lot of prostitutes, right?

&amp;#x200B;

As for what's important, I know it sounds like a cop-out, but honestly it's very subjective. Some people value family and love. Some people value money and career. Some people value social change. I think everyone should try to identify what they truly care about, and pursue that fully."
139,"I either drank too much for my tolerance or was slipped some sort of drug the night I was raped. I knew the first names of most of the people that were there (although I didn't know them well at all and shouldn't have been with them alone), but I don't remember any of the actual act or how it came about. Total blackout. I wasn't sure at the time that I was actually raped (although I had suspicious because of where I woke up/how I felt) but couldn't remember it so I didn't tell anybody. I was also ashamed that I was drinking underage and illegally so was too scared to tell somebody that could have helped me. I was also not sexually active at the time, so when I realized I was pregnant was when I knew for sure I had been raped that night."
140,Found joe rogan
141,"I get pretty lost in the touch, so I don't get bored, and everyone I've cuddled so far has become a repeat client, so I think they like it, too.

I charge $200 for two hours and $800 for overnights (12 hours)."
142,So they take them along for the ride?
143,And did you have any desire at all to keep the baby once you had given birth?
144,"Not really a question, but as a girl who literally JUST got up the nerve to go into an adult store alone, y'all are amazing. I was psyching myself out but the people there made me feel so comfortable!"
145,"No, they ARE the ride.....Baadda-Tish!"
146,I could use a good cuddle. I AM pretty lonely. I crave human touch and contact. Props to you for taking it to a professional level. Did you graduate college? If so what did you major in?
147,How old are you? Have you ever tried any psychedelic drugs?
148,"Yes. Lately, I've been going 3-4 times a week."
149,It’s all good dude. I’m just really glad now looking back that all the students didn’t get an email last night saying a student died... the baby situation was so fucked honestly. I still have the video recordings that I took outside the bathroom of the baby crying 😢 and it’s haunting. Did you graduate? What did you study?
150,I greatly appreciate and understand that. I would be honored to be a part of it.
151,"If you don’t mind me asking, can you explain to me, since you said you have a good relationship with your dad and that your mom lives in a house, Why can’t you move in with one of them temporarily or ask them to help? (Kudos for being clean! 🤙🏽)"
152,"I'm 17
No, I haven't tried them, but I guess it would be interesting to see the effects"
153,"It is, sadly. I was precocious and started my period at 8, almost 9. My sister started her period at around 9."
154,"Water to me honestly isn't a problem as long as you drink an adequate amount at night and milk causes you not to feel thirsty. 
As for those who are hospitalised it is said not to fast if you are too young, old or sick/affects your health negatively"
155,Has anyone taken the 15 minutes..
156,What are the most surprising things you've learned about human trafficking while being on the road? And have you ever come face to face with a trafficker?
157,Thanks.
158,"Great, so I'm already on the right track.  Thank you for your time."
159,"When the girls were sold, they spoke no Chinese. It was years until they could have any real sort of conversation with their ""husbands"". 

The traffickers had made excuses why the girls couldn't speak Chinese, the ""husbands"" believed them, and the girls had no say in it at all. I'm sure the ""husbands"" realised that the girls weren't exactly enthusiastic about getting married - but, as I said, they didn't particularly seem to care"
160,"they are first and foremost surprised at the progress i’ve made so far, but i think they’re still a little skeptical that i’ve truly turned things around. they didn’t know of anything i was doing during those years, and felt like they didn’t even know me. rightfully so, if i’m honest. so i believe they truly want the best for me, but still want to see me moving forward further. my siblings have been the most gracious in letting me back in their lives which i’m grateful for, but the important thing is that i’ve got a lot of “family” that isn’t blood on my side now. :)"
161,Maghrib time? More like McRib time. Amirite!
162,Are you seeking help for it at all?
163,"No one has smelled bad, but I request that all clients shower beforehand and don't wear perfume or cologne."
164,I quickly glanced at your post and read it as you had an abortion at 9AM.
165,"I'm sorry for your son, but at least you believe him? Idk my mother was never supportive.

And thanks :)"
166,How old are you and what drugs did you do
167,"Firstly I was born into a Muslim family. Born in the west and would say by the time I was 16 wasn't really following Islam and according to Islam I wasn't really a Muslim. At some point during my mid twenty's I started looking into Islam. Reading the Quran, the science, maths, linguistics in Quran, started researching and I personally found it to be the truth."
168,What did you do that for?
169,Have you fallen asleep since you started this AMA?
170,"Hey man just reading threw these I see there is alot of comments for you to read and I hope this one finds you well . But your not worthless dude. The society we live in makes it impossible for some people to function in. The fact we want everybody to act the same way and do the same things is rediculous and the lack understanding most people havr to help people positions like yours is even more unfortunate. You obviously have been delt a shit hand. And that doesn't make you worthless. It just makes you unlucky to be born into judgmental, close minded and selfish world. Love you dude. Keep doing your thing. As long as you don't give up people can't say shit."
171,Do you like steamed broccoli?
172,"What you’re doing is simply amazing, thank you for trying to make the world a better place. May I ask about this “husband”, what kind of person is okay with this? Was he a genuinely evil man or is there some sort of cultural factors that make this behaviour more normalized in other parts of the world?"
173,Ohhh makes sense
174,Is he still in prison?
