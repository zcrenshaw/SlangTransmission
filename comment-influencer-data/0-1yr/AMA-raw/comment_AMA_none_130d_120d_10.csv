0,"I am comfortably middle class so it did not threaten my food or shelter but it was a large amount for me. Figured it would be about 50/50 if I saw it again, but surprisingly I suppose, I was not that nervous about it."
1,you're a straight up stone cold good guy
2,"I met a man in prison. He was a wealthy businessman who was convicted of some pretty fucked up things. He was released when it was discovered that the supposed victim turned out to be a lying cunt.  A few years ago I tried tracking him down, only to find out that he committed suicide after struggling with homelessness and addictions after being shunned."
3,"Me and my older (by 3 years) brother worked at the same place. He has down syndrome. A colleague was bullying my brother pretty badly (nasty remarks, death threats, etc), so I confronted him. It got pretty heated so I ended up beating him to death."
4,Can you go to an Indian restaurant in Boston and give your feedback on what Americanized Indian food is like compared to back home?
5,I went through counselling.
6,How did you cope with knowing you killed somebody?
7,"I tried to, but it was just brushed under the rug because apparently when males are raped, it's not that big of a deal."
8,"Best advice I can give you. Block all their accounts on social media. If you can't see it, it doesn't exist. 😉"
9,"Had an older gentlemen in his late 80's who was a little hard of hearing. I put the mask on him to deliver some oxygen and I always say ""just need a couple of nice big breaths"". He says to me while popping his eyes open, ""Big breasts?! Where?"". I laughed really hard at that and never even thought of how closely those sounded."
10,"I still don't really know him but I have heard that things have turned around now, and he has steady work."
11,Very. In India only old people are fat. Here everyone from child to young people are fat.
12,Were you nervous loaning out that amount of money?
13,Did he managed to get along eventually?
14,Don't kill people
15,"What were you thinking, starting an AMA but answering only 1 question? (that's my actual question)"
16,"Sorry mate, it looks smaller than usual"
17,"When you got out of jail did you have that moment of realizing the world is not the same as when you left it? They often describe this moment in shows and movies and I’m just curious if you experienced some form of that. Like being amazed at how technology has progressed since you’ve been in jail, etc."
18,"No, It’s more like looking through binoculars. Everything that I see changes perspective uniformly. I think I’d go insane if body parts just started growing and shrinking of my own accord"
19,thanks
20,Male Female Female threesome.
21,Did you meet people in prison you thought shouldn’t be there or were genuinely innocent?
22,my wife :(
23,Does it affect the way you see certain body parts like you'll be talking to someone and their head just become a bobble head
24,bro i made this account after last nights game. felt like flying to philly and whooping everyone's ass besides kawhi :(
25,I had nightmares for a while.
26,I definitely did. Things were quite different but I managed to adjust fairly quickly.
27,"He was upset, but I he was able to get through it with support. Me and him were very close. Unfortunately he passed away in 2008. I still miss him dearly."
28,"Why did you not achieve 270+ points?

Will your professor give you that extra point?

What class is this?"
29,"I’d say 95% gag gifts, but sometimes I’ll have a customer who is interested/asks questions and then I try and direct them towards buying a better quality male sex toy, like the Pipedream realistic feeling torsos/butts/etc. Most of the time these customers are truck drivers."
30,I heard he had really solid contact with her boyfriend
31,"Yeah my grandparents believe every word out of his mouth to the point that they tried to help him put my parents in jail and would secretly give him: money, phones, plane tickets etc.


As for early signs I guess it was just that he didn’t really care about anybody, he lied, had no conscious, a complete lack of  empathy, but he is very charming and can make you believe almost anything."
32,I think she is low key racist man. Read my previous post
33,"Up until earlier this year it was as healthy as a relationship with someone like him could be. I pretended to be sympathetic and give him the best advice I could without him knowing that I am 100% aware that he is lying to me and trying to manipulate me. At the moment though I have cut off all communication since he tried to get my parents put in prison as I don’t want to end up being next..... he still sees me as someone he think he has under his spell, and that’s honestly the safest place to be with someone like him."
34,"He’ll either be dead from pissing off the wrong person or a drug overdose, or he’ll be in jail for murder or rape... me and my parents are honestly shocked that it hasn’t already happened... all of our therapists have been telling us for years to accept the fact that this is what his future holds....."
35,"I got an 80 on the last test and I have no idea how. 

No, probably not. Unless I give her a reason but she emailed us saying not to ask her lol. I need to think of anything that might convince her. 

I/O psychology."
36,"I was in a bar if the early 80s playing pool. I overheard a guy telling his mom (from a pay phone) he wouldn’t be home for Christmas because his car was in reliable and he couldn’t afford to fly.

After he hung up I struck up a conversation with him and asked what he needed, it was three hundred and something so I gave him $400.00. 

I was buzzed and it was Christmas so I felt good after getting him to accept. He said he’d pay it all back but I told him it wouldn’t be necessary. 

I saw him about a month later and we became great friends. Hung out all the time until I was transferred. 

Turns out he did eventually pay me back by bailing me out and my truck out of impound. He died about ten years back but sometime I miss him, great guy.

So, basically it was the best money I ever threw away."
37,I was imprisoned for manslaughter. Ask me one thing.
38,What made your day stressful?
39,"The summer camp I went to has overnights for each age group where we go on a mini camping trip. I was playing Magic: The Gathering with some friends and started to get tired so I went back to our sleeping bags to take a nap. Out of nowhere, I wake up and find out that this guy is on top of me, dick in my ass and raping me. I finally got him off because a counselor came over and saw what happened. I could be butchering some of it as I've tried to block it out of my memory."
40,"Did you press charges? What was the process like for you in deciding whether or not to?

Also, I'm really sorry this happened to you."
41,Don’t AMAs usually involve answers?
42,Hey fellow night shifter. Isnt the lack of management so nice??!
43,"All 3 are crazy people. They provide a little bit of humor in an otherwise serious and monotonous job. 

1) Had a guy call saying someone was breaking into his house to put cameras in his smoke detectors, then yelled at me because the police were taking too long to get there and demanded to see me at his house so he could file a complaint (we work with about 40 different departments and aren’t tied to any specific one.)

2) Lady insisting she was 500 feet in the air and needed help getting down because she was abducted by aliens and they were going to experiment on her. 

3) This guy calling 911 because his trash cans told him to. Didn’t give us any more information."
44,"I had been in emergency services for years before getting into answering 911 calls, so I have been listening to scanners for a long time prior and had a pretty good idea to expect. 

No one call has ever really thrown me off too much, but what took some getting used to was mothers calling in medical emergencies for their children. 

I have worked on an ambulance and have had the hysterical parents, but we always had police to calm them down or remove them so we could work. 

When you are on the phones there are no police and you get 100% of their emotions screaming at you begging you for help. We prepared for a long time in a classroom setting for different types of calls, but no amount of training can prepare you for that."
45,Ignore them. It’s no one else’s business!!!
46,No. We will always win. We may just have to give you more than anticipated. Most of out drugs work by stimulating the release of GABA (big long word that I'm not spelling out) which causes inhibition of almost everything else in the brain. Like a light switch effect really.
47,How much fatter are Americans?
48,"I love the job, sincerely. I feel very lucky because I’m treated well and enjoy the work, plus it’s given me a unique perspective in terms of studying behavioral science/psychology.

And definitely, but I’d assume it’s about the same as most women get in any job dealing with people. I don’t mind the innocently dirty dad jokes for the most part, I like to let people have fun. However, the creepiest customers are typically couples, interestingly. And the scenario is pretty common, the woman tries on lingerie and the couple asks for assistance—which really is me somehow adjusting or helping her put the outfit on. The dude will watch or make comments, and sometimes it’s really subtle so it’s difficult for me to navigate."
49,Why did you kill that person ?
50,We're cultivating mass.
51,"We are required to stay for the entire part and escort you to recovery until we hand off to a recovery room nurse. We don't just sit. We must titrate anesthetic gases, give medications, keep your vital signs stable and interven if necessary. We give IV fluids and monitor all kinds of aspects of how you are responding to anesthesia and the surgery. We also must record these things in your chart (paper or electronic)."
52,I’d imagine beating someone to death would be really hard. So did it traumatize you?
53,"Leave the church. I am an ex Mormon and I’m telling you that you will never be happy there and be gay. Especially dating someone with a kink as well 

Just some advice. From someone who’s family member WAS excommunicated for being gay"
54,No. It's techno all the way.
55,Truly a connoisseur.
56,"I hope you talked more in counseling than you have here, dude."
57,"That's the best use of the word ""was"" I've ever seen."
58,"Yeah, it helped me with my anger issues and helped me get better and thinking before doing."
59,Hello.. It is that’s definitely one of the many pluses of night shift
60,Damn. I don't think the average person understands what it's like to just be accused of a crime let alone being convicted and doing time to something they didn't do.
61,it's probably going to be average just not hot enough. A lot of indian restaurant owners are first generation immigrants so they know their food.
62,He was a good friend.
63,not asking my 11th grade crush out. she's a pornstar now and has over 20 mainstream videos
64,You should see my dick
65,"Not at all, it’s actually pretty cool because he’s got some weird friends I can relate to for the most part. Also he’s super accepting of everything."
66,"A big thing is it made me able to identify attention seeking behaviors very easily and not get frustrated with people for doing it. 
Gave me a lot of patience and taught me to take a step back and really analyze why people are found what they are doing, and to take almost none of it personally.
I am able to spot signs of people trying to manipulate me, very quickly and I have the tools to confront them as well without sparking an angry argument.
Also made me be a little more skeptical of people without being withdrawn or accusing them of things constantly and seeming distrusting."
67,"I don't know if this weird but when I was 21 I mixed vodka, an expresso shot, and red bull and drank it together... and guess what? I didn't die lol"
68,Yes. I actually left the camp the next day. About 9 days early. I have since healed to the point where I can live a happy and healthy life thanks to therapy.
69,"I just read your previous post. You ever watch the movie Get Out...?! She invalidated your feelings by telling you to shut up and calm down after you confronted her about her conversation with her mom. As an outside looking at your relationship, I think her words demonstrate an inability to communicate effectively and with respect and emotional intelligence. It seems like your interactions with her family are weighing heavily on you and clearly have upset you which is entirely understandable. I would probably be very angry if I were in your situation. If I were to give you any advice it would be to be honest with yourself about whether you would like to continue your relationship with her. I can understand possible reasons for wanting to stay with her - perhaps you still love her and you want to make things work. I get that. However, at the same time, I think it’s also important to realize that you two are different from each other in many ways. When two people from different backgrounds get married I think it’s important for them to understand each other and have empathy. She seems to really lack that empathy from the interaction you described in your previous post."
70,"Well, the prison helped out pretty well with the job hunt. My place of work specifically hires ex prisoners. I hardly get any trouble."
71,Do people actually use blow up dolls or are they just gag gifts
72,"Had wisdom teeth out, got nitrous or whatever.  I was not out, just unable to open my eyes, but I was experiencing the whole procedure (thankfully I had a local.) Listening to dentist and assistant go on and on about her dog always jumping outside into mud, blah blah.  My teeth had to be cracked into pieces, several times for each tooth.  Just annoying.

Then she said something that made the dentist laugh and the drill slipped right into the gum.  Rude awakening.  I asked her to stop making him laugh. ""How did you know?!"" ""I've just been resting my eyes, bored with dog conversations, but otherwise awake."" Biiig dose of gas after that, too much that time; evidently didn't mix gases right.  Had to go to hospital in ambulance because I wouldn't wake up.  Bad day all around, last tooth came out in hospital.  He got shut down soon after."
73,I feel like this answer could have been much more in-depth.
74,"Yes, I do."
75,How?
76,Through my T-shirt
77,Seems like it might have been a good idea to have a word with your grandfather about securing that a bit better.
78,"I shouldn't, but I lol'd."
79,Fortunately I don't it was at a summer camp in California. That's where he lives. I live in Arizona.
80,"You sound like an awesome person, we need more like you. Thanks for helping out a fellow human being when they needed it!"
81,"Well that’s what I call my bottle of NyQuil, so yes it does."
82,"Would you fuck your old high school principal for $20,000?"
83,Boxing instructor
84,"swallow my dads and say ""no hommo"""
85,"It’s not up to us to decide if a call is a prank call or not. Our policy is “Everything that comes in goes out.”

If someone calls saying there’s a man in a ski mask, robbing a bank at 123 Main Street in TownA, but we hear a bunch of kids giggling and their location is dropping 4 towns over, we still give out the call as an armed robbery in progress, but we do inform the officers that it’s a possible bad call, and there are children giggling on the line. We let the police determine what they want to do."
86,Do you still see the other guy in your day to day life?
87,"Most people were alright around me. I treated them with respect, most did the same. I just kept my head down and didn't go around acting like the big man.

People find out through gossip."
88,Not on every street as Reddit thinks. But usually one corner of an older street becomes the dumping ground for everything. Including shitting.
89,You just killed a man
90,What is your favorite genre of porn?
91,"This just makes me so mad.  Ugh.  Have you been able to heal at all?  If so what has that looked like? 

&amp;#x200B;

This subject is so taboo which is bad.  Men are afraid of being falsely accused of rape but should be more afraid of being raped themselves."
92,TA here. That’s an idiotic move.
93,Shhh don’t piss him off I heard he throws a solid tight hook
94,RemindMe! May 3 2029
95,"It varies because things he did when he was younger were horrifying because of his age, and then he’s done some just awful things as he is older but there is less shock factor now....

One that sticks with me other than the time he was gonna kill me was something he wrote when he was little:

It was summer time around 2nd grade for him, and we would play school a lot as a game. I was the teacher and I would give him assignments and stuff to do. Sometimes they were fun silly things(like play on the trampoline) other times it was like actual school to help prepare him for some of the material he was gonna learn in the coming school year.
One time I had him write a one page essay about whatever he wanted (goal was to help him with his handwriting). It was a good day with no real issues so when I read the essay it was very shocking.

To paraphrase he wrote:

I can’t wait to rape my whore bitch sister she is such a whore rape will be fun....

It was pretty disturbing"
96,lol @ that username and just wanting to comment in /r nba
97,Do you feel your sentence has helped you rehabilitate or not? What would you change about the justice system to make it more effective?
98,"Has anyone ever beat the drugs they give you? Like when I had my gul bladder removed, I told the nurse I could beat it, but was out like a light in a few seconds. I imagine there is someone out there who could keep themselves awake, despite the drugs taking effect right?"
99,"I can't say that I've fully been able to heal from it, but I have been able to move on. I can live a normal life if that makes sense. I pretty much went to therapy and it really helped."
100,How was your brother through all of this? Is he still with us?
101,"I live in Canada and we have federal regulations about the amount of interest/service charges that can be charged, so they are not as bad as they are in some other countries. But IMO by design or by accident they take advantage of the poor."
102,I was 15 and I'm not exactly sure how old he was. It wasn't pedophilia. It was one of the other kids which is one of the reasons it was brushed aside.
103,I just read this and burst out crying! I really needed to read this. Thank you!
104,your hot
105,i am cat :)
106,"Pretty much, as he is older now he does think things through more about how things would benefit him long term. But he has severe ADHD so if I could get him excited about the next thing, his current task gets forgotten and his new goal becomes how to get the thing he wants now instead"
107,Does him being a furry have a negative impact on your relationship?
108,What did your wife do?
109,"UPDATE: SOMEONE HAS HELPED ME OUT. I CAN NOT THANK EVERYONE ENOUGH. 
 
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIA"
110,"I support this. I went through the while unfriend and unfollow phase after a breakup for my own mental health and deactivated for a couple of months. Keep yourself busy, go to the gym take up running or learn how to cook."
111,Yeah it’s now locked away in his workshop after my grandma found out he had it
112,"Don't feel like a failure over one point! I promise, in 3 years time it will be irrelevant."
113,Looks like somebody has a thing for generosity lol
114,"No, he bit me while I was holding it against my chest/torso and he was trying to get away from me.

No blood."
115,"No – though he is definitely asking for it, that sort of retaliation would probably be frowned upon by my co-workers.

Also, ducks do not have nipples."
116,Do you think that Disco will make a comeback?
117,"Put a gun against his head, pulled the trigger now he’s dead!!!!! MAMA, LIFE HAD JUST BEGUN, BUT NOW IVE GONE AND THROWN IT ALL AWAYYYYY"
118,"Well, when I punched him he landed on a lava lamp and it smashed. He was breathing, but out cold. I called 999 (UK Man here) and was arrested originally for Grevious bodily harm, but he died the next day and so I was now looking at murder charges, but then I was done for Manslaughter."
119,Do you plan on biting it’s nipple to regain dominance?
120,"I currently have monthly meetings with Probation Officers (used to be weekly but was reduced to monthly because of my good behavior and co-operation). When people on life sentences are released from prison in the UK, they are on a life licence and are given a list of strict rules they have to abide by (like getting permission before gaining employment, rules on where you can go, live, etc)."
121,Did you know the man  that you punched or was it some random guy that your girlfriend was sleeping around with?
122,"UK. Meh, it was pretty easy for me. The prison helped me find work, which I still have to this day."
123,"What was the call that most surprised you, either in a positive or negative way? 

As you've said you've probably heard it all, but was there ever something that just threw you off or felt like it came completely out of left field?"
124,no but we can pretend I am ;)
125,Absolutely it’s my day off and I still can’t sleep like a normal person
126,Do bottles of “drink me” help at all?
127,"I got a 77.46 
Needed a 77.5 to get a B"
128,Yes.
129,What sort of advice were you given?
130,The friendship ended with him nailing my gf. I find the whole situation a sad thing to have happened.
131,Is it true India has poop streets? Don't worry here in America we too have poop streets in San Francisco
132,"I had TV. It was just a few basic channels I had but I still managed to get the news, plus word does get around."
133,Hard? Not really. It's more about paying attention than anything. Confirm and reconfirm kind of stuff more than anything.
134,"I guess if you were willing to fuck her, you should be willing to be seen with her. I don’t have a question I just think you’re really shitty."
135,He doesn’t think he only destroys
136,"The brand X4 Labs makes some extension and straightening kits that we sell, albeit rarely because they’re quite expensive. It’s difficult to say just how effective they are bc there isn’t much outside research available. However, pumps, pills, or topicals are not going to do much other than temporarily increase size due to increased blood circulation."
137,To show what even the worst can change.
138,"Have I? Unfortunately not. 

HOWEVER, we work in teams of 2 in our “pods” in case one of us get tied up with a caller, the other one can pick up our phones and talk directly with the police, fire, EMS, utilities dispatchers, etc. It’s a quicker method of communicating than typing everything in the computer and waiting for the dispatcher to read it. 

My “pod partner” took an EMS call for this guy’s girlfriend who passed out while he was handcuffed to a bed."
139,"Literally every. Single. Day. Most of the time it’s just 12 year olds giggling like “what’s the biggest dildo you have” but sometimes I’ll get good ones. My response is usually like, “yo do you know how many of these I get a day, can you be creative please?”"
140,What happened?
141,So where is she at in life now?
142,I think OP mean gender pronouns
143,I am currently 18.
144,Do you regret the murder?
145,"I've gotten to the point where I can live a healthy and happy life, but from time to time the memory of it comes back and haunts me for at least a day or two."
146,I work at a Warehouse. I work Monday to Thursday 6pm-6am.
147,"He was adopted at the age of 7ish months. Before that he was with his birth mom(my aunt) and CPS took him from the home for neglect(she’s a drug addict and has had a child-my cousin-taken before.)  Once cps took him my parents ended up adopting him... so while he has no memory of him first few months on this earth it still can have a phycological impact on a child... but my parents did and gave everything they had to help him, and nothing worked."
148,"Kids are actually better at calling 911 than you’d think. It’s just like a call from an adult, except they usually don’t have a complete understanding of what’s going on. 

One that we get a lot is kids calling for their diabetic parents saying, “I know mommy (or daddy) is sick, and I can’t get them to wake up.”

You have to be a little more direct and creative with your questions, but most of the time they do surprisingly well and just want to try and help."
149,So she was 18 when you met? Did you feel weird about the age difference at the time?
150,"I do not understand any of these words, but I am upvoting every response you make in the hopes that you achieve your goal."
151,"I grew up in Canada. Moved to the states where I live now. The difference between the two places is subtle, but one is this: in Canada, I had the feeling that people had my back. In America, I don't have that feeling. The mythology of America is part of it: America is an every man for himself kind of country, whereas Canada is a more, lets all pitch in and help people kind of a country. 

Anyway, I don't have a question. This AMA confirms something I've felt. Also, I know this is a massive generalization. I've met good people here who help people a lot. Just a feeling peeps."
152,"Was she 18? 

If she is 20 now, and they have a 2 year old, then she had the baby at 18. We assume the baby making took place within the 3 months after turning 18, any later than that and she would have had the baby at 19 and be 21 now. 

I truly hope that's the case, and I'd bet people are having similar internal struggles when you feel that people are uncomfortable. They are likely uncertain that the situation is ok or not. Should we be happy for them or be concerned? No one wants to make assumptions about people they care for, and it's not a question they can really ask you without being the asshole.  But there is a level of community concern that is appropriate when it comes to protecting minors. 

What would the response be if everyone looked the other way and hoped for the best, and it turned out that she was a minor when the relationship began?"
153,What do you mean by personal pronouns?
154,"It was for my parents. I grew up with him though so it was no shock to me. We shared a childhood where as most adult in our life just witnessed our childhood, so my understanding and comprehension of who and what he is is very different than even my parents, and it comes very naturally for me"
155,i like anything with chocolate tbh. i had this nutella fudge sundae and im pretty sure i came while eating it lol
156,did you enjoy working at the job? did you ever get creeps/weirdos?
157,Yes I am. The episodes never last more than 10 minutes so I can easily pull over and wait it out.
158,"I’ll answer this categorically.

Toy: Njoy Purewand hands down. I recommend it to customers all the time and I’ve yet to meet anyone who’s disappointed. It looks intimidating but it’s the best toy for gspot orgasms I’ve ever used.

Lube: Sliquid Silk, Sliquid Sassy, and Wicked Ultra Chill for anal.

Other: Sliquid’s feminine wash, Wet Head blowjob spray (apple flavor), and Sensuva On clitoral stimulating oil."
159,Private security. Night shift never bothered me but I am starting to get burnt out on it
160,What's the funniest thing you've experienced in your career?
161,"It depends on the crime and person. I think that people who regularly use drugs should be classed as mentally ill and sectioned where they can hopefully get better help, not jailed for possession."
162,"I suppose? Even though it looks like a glass of water is on the other side of the room I can still reach out and grab it without being unsure of where it is in relation to me, but perhaps I’ve just grown accustomed to having to compensate for the incorrect distance over the last decade and a half.

It’s honestly really cool sometimes when I’m not doing stuff because I’ll just go sit outside and observe nature from a different perspective than I normally have."
163,"You could be right, I hope you are wrong, but you may be right."
164,Thanks for the good thoughts.
165,Did other cell mates fear you due to your charges? And how is it that people in prison find out about what charges every new person has?
166,Have you thought of maybe taking up boxing
167,Well yeah! Lol
168,That's one of the reasons why I made this AMA.
169,If you have paypal I’ll send you the $15
170,It sounds like you really turned yourself and your life around.  Kudos.
171,You can no longer get excommunicated for being gay thankfully. But I am gonna stay in the church until it becomes too much to bare. I still fully believe and have my faith.
172,I have no idea.
173,"I think OP meant him, her, they’re, and all the new ones"
174,"Unfortunately our paralytics work well, but they are the common enemy in allergic reactions. These are still very rare though. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. I promise that there are scores of people looking at ways to prevent these types of occurrences. Again, my condolences to you."
175,Did it like jump at you and bite and did it draw blood?
176,That means you weren’t hugging it hard enough
177,"How difficult is it to find a job after a prison conviction, especially for manslaughter? What sort of stigma have you faced?"
178,I’m so sorry! Did you tell your parents? Have you sought counseling?
179,I would like to see a note from your professor young man!
180,oopsie looks like I didn't have a fun childhood huh 🙀😿
181,What country was this in? Was it hard to find work upon your release?
182,Do you find it hard to reconcile the fact that you're placing your faith in an organization who has spent a significant amount of money trying to make life harder on the LGBT community?
183,"You mentioned beggars outside of Luxury apartments.

I was under the impression that the wealth difference was much more obvious, and even greater, in the larger cities in India. 

Have I been misled?"
184,Do you stay in the operating room during the whole surgery? Do you just sit there and make sure the patient doesn’t wake up or have some type of reaction to the anesthesia?
185,If you're happy then fuck the haters. You can't live your life trying time please or Impress other people. You have one life so do what makes you happy.
186,"We in anesthesia have a very raised caution flag on dental anesthesia for this reason. The stuff isn't to be taken lightly. People have dental anesthesia complications all the time. I teach it to some and have no interest in those who think ""what is the big deal?"""
187,I asked if she could tell me questions I missed and I’m going to see if I can make a case for it.
188,"That’s what is odd about it, because for me it was just normal. Wasn’t terrified most of the time and I was pretty equipped to handle these situations. Shortly after the essay his therapist told my parents that he would recommend not having us live in the same house until this behavior pattern about wanting to hurt me passes..... I do tend to cope using humor though, and looking back these stories are kinda funny in hindsight, but I do have a morbid sense of humor"
189,"I know a few Downs people. It is true, they are some of the nicest people ever, and so was my brother."
190,I'm a night shifter of 10 years. Do you have terrible insomnia like I do?
191,I blame the Catholics.  You know how much they love mass.
192,"Say what you like about Switzerland, but the flag is a big plus."
193,To have the same contract Lebron James has with the lakers lol
194,Jesus Christ.  I’m from the US and had no idea there were shitting streets anywhere
195,I took a shit in a clean toilet. Thank you America.
196,"No, I didn't do the right thing."
197,Username checks out.
198,How do you feel about payday loan companies?
199,What's your relationship like with him now? Are you angry? Sympathetic? How do you think he feels about you?
200,What hobby do you have that you could join a club for and make new friends at?
201,Will aflac cover this?
202,How is it affecting you? Daily life?
203,Is it hard not to mess up? Like you have to calculate the right amount to give a certain person and if you give them too much it could kill them yada yada...
204,Well it’s been 4 years I’m still eating for the effects I guess lol
205,"This is true, it is a spectrum. Some really are killers, others are super successful business men... you’ve got your Dahmers and you’ve got your Trumps"
206,yes
207,Not trying to scare people but keep in mind any surgery is dangerous. I lost my wife in October during a routine laparoscopy. She was given a drug called rocuronium which caused a “dynamic” anaphylactic reaction. She was in a coma for 20 days with profound brain damage before they took out her ventilator and she died in my arms. She had just turned 39. Yes I have no doubt your colleagues all do a great job but fellow redditors keep in mind with even the most straightforward procedures things can and do go wrong - don’t take the decision to have surgery lightly.
208,Her first name is Julia. That’s all I’m saying lol
209,"let me guess, the lying cunt was accusing falsely him of rape and the authorities used her word as a “proof”?"
210,What happened immediately after the punch? Was he unconscious? I assume you or the girl called 911? Were you arrested that night?
211,"I wanted to break up with her, but continued to deposit nuts"
212,"Did you think ""In the right context that might have felt nice"" as you patted the duck and giggled  until Rhonda walked in and. told everyone ypu had an erection even though it was just the fucking pleat probably and now you're unemployed and everyone calls me DuckFuck?"
213,"No, I do not believe in God, or any religion."
214,"It’s a lot more health based that is assumed. I got to attend a seminar with Jessica Drake and she said that sex shop employees are truly community sex educators, and she’s so right. There isn’t really other places to go and gain sexual health knowledge, and a lot of people really have so many misconceptions about sex toys, or sexuality in general. And a lot of customers are there for health related purchases rather than pleasure related.

People come to you with things they won’t even discuss with their doctor. I have lots of male customers with enlarged prostates that come looking for butt plugs and are ridden with anxiety over it. I’ve even had a customer with scar tissue from a hemorrhoid removal who had to purchase something for dilation. Post-menopausal women, men who’ve had prostate cancer, and people who struggle with orgasm diminishment from antidepressants are common."
215,Are you allowed to drive?
216,Guy 3 has it all backwards! Never trust a trash can! They're filled to the brim with garbage.
217,"They would hate me, my uncles are gay as well and essentially disowned for being that way. I’ve told them, but I live in a highly Anti-LGBT home right now and can’t wait to move away."
218,How much in the way of outside world news do you get in prison? Gulf war? 9/11?
219,Didn’t you just complain about racist jokes...
220,so happy for you :) tell her I said hi woman
221,Yeah I think growing up with him shaped me to be a pretty well equipped person for the real world
