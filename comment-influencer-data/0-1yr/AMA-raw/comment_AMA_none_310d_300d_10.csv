1,I am not a strong man.
2,"Idk, it's been over an hour. Wouldn't it be kind of weird if I ask them now?"
3,"Some people lay in bed with only boxers,ask him to throw you a pair of pants,if he asks why just say you’re only in your undies."
4,"You should just casually be like, 

""Hey, can one of you toss me that pair of pants over there?"" 

(assuming your pants are in the vicinity)

If they ask why you don't have pants on, just be like, ""....didn't feel well and was gonna take a nap, but I think it's just allergies.....I was feeling all warm so I took them off, but now you guys are here, so I should prob put pants on, don't you think?"""
5,"I mean we've been here for a while, wouldn't it be weird do decide to do it now? Good idea though, wish I had thought of it sooner.

16,Happy cake day! I never know when mine is.
17,"Someone with an extremely high IQ (142 I think) once told me, that you can't  measure the actual intellect of off something, because it's more like a Jar. You can have a big jar and fill it with crap, or nothing really. And you can have a smaller jar, but fill it with good things. Things that make you happy and let you achieve the skills you like. And I think that is all you need after all. You are not limited in any way, you just need to work harder. But a low IQ doesn't mean you are not capable of working hard to do so.

Best of luck to you, and I wish you a happy life. "
18,I never had sex before... I'll guess doggy?
19,Weird flex but ok.
20,Nice to meet you bud. Don't really have a question but I just want to let you know you're not alone. I have a brother that is in the same boat. He's 26 IQ of around 50 and the mental age of a young teenager. He's a pretty cool guy and he's knows tons of things about trains that I probably never could.

23,All languages are made up.  Congratulations on being a native speaker of a new language?
24,"No, not at all! You were comfy (so why would you move in the beginning) and now you gutta get up and get ready so it won’t be weird at all! Like somebody else said, just pretend you’re only in your undies! 

You could say something like “sorry ladies but unless you wanna see my briefs, I’m gunna need you to toss my pants on over this way.” Lol "
25,"Just call it and own it. They’re guys. They get it. Ask for the pants and tell them you were about to spank the one-eyed snake and they walked in. It’s your home. If they laugh, laugh along cause it’s fucking funny. You’re a legend. OWN IT my man. "

32,Why thank you I’m fixed
33,They're rigged and unfair.
34,"Is the language completely made up or is it based off of a tv show or movie, also can you and your siblings still speak it to each other as a form of secret communication?"

48,This makes me so happy.
49,"I'm a School Psychologist and a huge part of my job is giving cognitive and achievement tests to identify students who need special education services. You said that you were administered the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test - this test really only looks at one part of overall cognitive abilities, fluid reasoning. I've tested many kids who scored poorly on measures of fluid reasoning, but demonstrate strengths in other areas and end up with IQ scores in the low average or even average range. Don't let this one score on one test define you. People make a huge deal out of IQ, when it's really only useful for predicting achievement. There are plenty of people with low IQ scores that go on to live average, fulfilling lives, just like there are people with high IQ scores who achieve nothing. I guess my point is... You're more than a score on a test, so don't let yourself be limited by some number. Did you ever receive any special education classes when you were in school? "
50,50/50 they help you with NNN
51,"""move I'm gay"""
52,"People think that escorting is all about the money when in fact the money really isn’t everyone’s measure of successful sexwork. Some people really want to connect with others but don’t have enough self esteem to put themselves out there authentically. Hiding behind a stage name and making the connection a transaction minimizes the sting of rejection and judgement. Essentially, sometimes sexworkers buy into the fantasy even more than their clients.

63,"It's your dorm room, you don't have to wear pants. The nap excuse is legit. Just say excuse me, I have to put my pants on and just do it. 

However, this is totally a Seinfeld premise. "
64,Have you tried pressing the mute button again to see if you can unmute?
65,We sound fucking retarded tho
66,"When you become a journalist, do you think your readers will care if you're happy or not?

It seems to me that you shouldn't be concerned with whether your clients care about your well-being or not. They're just customers. It's only your family and friends you who you should care whether they value you or not because they're the ones who matter.

67,"Well, probably i will hire a assassin to do this"

Also maybe there is a ""seems legit"" way to walk out of the room with your blanket wrapped around you like faking sick or saying it's cold or making ""beep boop beep boop I'm a space alien"" noises and out-weird the room to where no one suspects and then when they ask you why later say it was because you were trying to jack off in peace and no one will believe you because its true."

90,"Reading clocks is a weird way to get off!

91,"Yeah if I laugh hard enough it sounds like heavy breathing, and when I sneeze sounds normal."
92,"Yeah theres some grammar rules, like plurals always start with Da, Verbs always end with y and words in the past tense words start with Me. Theres probably one or more rules I havent thought about.

100,Lol no actually your the first usually I make all the jokes myself
101,"Hi, I’m a linguist and I have all the questions. Are the verb tenses the same as English or are other moods and aspects involved?

SVO? SOV? Is everything in the passive voice?

Where are adjectives placed in relation to nouns? Do adjectives serve primarily to differentiate between possibilities or to express the speaker’s feelings about the noun?

Is it stem based? Are adjectives and verbs largely separate vocabularies or can they be readily formed into one another?

What role does tone play?

Do questions use auxiliary verbs or are there interrogative conjugations? Are there irregular verbs?"
102,"I know where this is going

!Remind_r/fbi"
103,"Not a question, but I’m just too happy to hear this not to share: 

My dad met my mom when I was four and he gave me a ring of adoption on the same day he and my mother said “I do.” 

I never, ever think about it though (taking him for granted like we all do with our fathers at some point), only in times where I’m reminded (like from posts like these). Hell, at the doctors office, when asked if there is a history of medical problems on my dad’s side, I think of him, not realizing we are not biologically related until too late. 

He is the best, and maybe the only, thing to have ever chosen me. I love him and appreciate him more than words can say. "

112,Tomato
113,"Very true!  I have only had paid friendships for quite a while.... stylists, estheticians, masseuses, etc. After communicating that I was ready to transition from escorting and would be utilizing their services less, I saw who my real friends are. I have none. My family is happy to have me back and I’m thankful for their love but hope I don’t disappoint them by going back to the business. "
114,"If you notice something interesting about your body, do you assume it is unique to you? Or do you assume that it is common?

When he died- his note explained that the way we grew up and the way I turned out were too much for him to live with. Last year, the stress of grief took over my body in the form of a rash. I stopped working for 2 months. I’ve been trying not to connect with the loss and it’s kept me stuck in denial. It’s time to be real. He will have been dead for 2 years January 17, 2019. "

173," Not the original commenter, but maybe record a skype call with you and your family speaking in “your language” 

I get that people are weird and I can totally believe a parent wanting or trying to do this. But language is incredibly complex.

They also have posted obsessively about the importance of IQ and then when kind people like you tell them it’s not important, the follow it up with a post asking why people refuse to acknowledge the importance of IQ scores. 

OP is either a troll or has some other stuff going on. u/vlakiades if you aren’t a troll I would highly recommend going to talk to a counselor (that would be not someone based in your church as you seem to be highly active. Get a purely medical opinion from someone who hasn’t worked with you before). Considering the number of posts you’ve put out about this you are letting it consume your life, and you deserve better. "

Do that. A bunch. If there’s grammar, we’ll figure it out. If it’s plugging something into Lingojam, we’ll also figure that out. "
180,"Many years ago I had many people at an apartment I rented with some friends. I wouldn't call it a party but there were 20 or so people inside. For whatever reason we turned off all the lights and were flicking lighters on and off to see in the dark while we talked.

Eventually someone said they were getting up to turn on the lights. And one of my friends started giggling uncontrollably. The lights were turned on and he was naked with socks, shoes, shirt, and pants in separate corners of the room. I was sitting right next to him and never felt any noticable movement.
