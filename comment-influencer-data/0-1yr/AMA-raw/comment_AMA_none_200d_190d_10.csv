7,"it doesnt actually add credibility. It simply shows that its a well known location, that is easily google-able.

threats should be taken down, im not sure about inciting violence but im _pretty_ _sure_ that should be taken down as well."
8,"Random fact of the day (if you didn’t already know): the first heart transplant (and penis transplant) happened in SA, not at the same time though, which would’ve been cooler. 

And also how advanced certain parts of SA are. If you walk around in Cape Town or Stellenbosch you’d feel like you’re in Europe. "
9,Do they know you’ve been diagnosed bipolar?

12,Uh okay bro

17,"It’s not a simple spelling error though LMFAO. dysmorphia and dysphoria are completely different disorders and it changes the entire meaning of the sentence.

22,You're feeding a troll.
23,"I will have several questions, if it would be too many feel free just to pick some of them (or non of them). 

And I'm sorry you had to deal with some terrible situations in your life, I hope only good things will happen to you now

How your inner world looks like?

How many alters do you have, what are their names?

How are you as a system deal with everyday life, as you sad here before, not many people knows about your disorder, if there is a switch when you are with friends or in school/work, do your alters act like host?

Is host ""original"" personality? "

34,"I can say with absolutely certainty that it’s impossible to just know a language without having learned it over years. The rest is pure speculation though, you’re right "
35,"This also might sound odd, but does eventually taking your leave ever scare you? That thought of when Bap can put this faction back together that you’re going to disappear. Or do you see it more as satisfactory? That you sort of accomplished what you wanted to do?"

50,How were you addicted? And what was the turning point where you decided you had to fixit? 
51,"Gotcha.

Here where i am from, you need to ensure that you are physically apart from each other, cannot share meals etc.

As for future investment, take it from a 40 year old who has had to deal with a slew of medical issues that could have compromised my retirement plans.

Also, retirement doesn't mean you need to stop doing what you love doing, it's actually the opposite and the longer you take to formulate a plan, the less chances you have of planning something out that doesn't leave you to the whim of your month-to-month pension cheques.

Good luck!"

55,"Look up a case on Truddi Chase. Because it scared the living Hell out of me. 

Hell there have even been normal people without the disorder who went into a coma, woke up , could not remember their own language and were fluent in another that they weren't even taking or fluent in before. Multiple cases. It's scary.

56,"Does everything change back to that time, or just my age?"
57,Not from the condition. I just get migraines in the general sense of things lol -Bap
58,"That's actually a great question. Today, it will be a lot easier for one simple reason only. All the different crypto payment card options... Today we have different applications that lets users hold, store and spend various assets. A lot of these apps even have a card scheme connected so that you can simply use the visa or the MasterCard networks. Now with that said, paying with Bitcoin directly was actually the challenge, and I did not use any of the payment card options back then (as there weren't really any). If I had to do the same experiment today, where I was only able to pay to shops that accepted bitcoin directly, I could not do it very easily. Today, there are fewer stores in Copenhagen accepting bitcoin payments as opposed to back in 2015, when I did the experiment."
59,Think about it. 20 shekels!
60,It should be completed within 4 to maximum 6 weeks. :) 
61,"Honestly, I didn't do the math - I know that I would be disappointed. In my opinion, it kind of shows why Bitcoin is not meant to be a transactional currency, but might be more appropriate for store of value. "
62,There's no way of explaining it but it feels pretty fucking awesome. 
63,Nope
64,Who got you to smoke ? 
65,"Hello Jack! Do you think the based economy of trust in Denmark made it possible for this experiment to happen? Do you think you would be successful trying to do the same in countries with a different economy, like Spain, Italy, Portugal, for example?"
66,What is the fate of Bitcoin and the money making opportunity in the cryptospace in the future  according to you ?
67,"Both. I have fun doing it and even if I were to get other work or switch careers I would still write all the time, whenever I could. I don't always enjoy it though. As far as money I can make really good money off writing if I churn out short stories under my female erotica pen names but there's no soul in it and it's repetitive so I do it in short bursts and then coast on the money they bring in until I need to churn out a bunch more, that stuff is pure pulp fiction.

My actual novels and the stories I publish under my main/public pen names take longer because I care more about them and put more work into them and have more personal investment in them, but they don't make as much as the sexy short stories lol. I actually started publishing erotica in first, purely for the money, when I was in high school; I used it to fund my pot habit. "
68,And a lot of those fckers.  It's amazing how many trash bags one goes through.  
69,"Yeah I just saw that comment, while pedophilia is different than hebephila(not by much) the guy you low key defended has been known to target girls well below what you seem to seem acceptable. "
70,"I would also like to add:

Flashlight for under the sink
Trash bags

71,"I like to draw, play piano, saxophone, I play tennis and basketball, and game a bit."
72,"A tool kit. Doesn’t have to be fancy just the basics(hammer, screwdrivers, etc.). This will come in handy more than you ever thought."
73,Well take care of yourself. Message me anytime if you want to talk. 
74,"The US. For 2 year olds it's not a demanding environment. There's free play, we do lots of crafts, they have naptime, we read stories together etc. Its very relaxed and is mostly focused on children learning social skills and having basic knowledge for things such as colors, counting and recognizing their name. "
75,"I don't actively pick my nose. I have before, we all have, but not something I do in general. "
76,"totally agree with you about toilet paper and paper towels. 

I would add ice cube tray, coffee machine(w/filters, if not kuerig) 

sponges"
77,"Have you looked for some professional help :)? I have a lot of issues too, and I feel so bad for you. "

81,"It was quite a fun experiment and a lot of things were actually challenging. Some things that I wanted to buy, I never ended up buying and I simply had to do without. One thing for example was public transportation. Back then, I had quite a commute on my way to work - suddenly I had to find other ways of getting transportation. The CEO of the company I was working with at the time told me that I could spend money in any shop that I was able to onboard onto their merchant platform for Bitcoin. Basically, if I could convince the ships to accept bitcoin payments, I could buy stuff for Bitcoin. Long story short, we managed to convince several bars and pubs around the city to take part in the first ever Bitcoin pub crawl. I am also the proud owner of one of the most expensive tattoos in the world, as I did manage to get my tattoo artist to accept Bitcoin."

92,"In this scenario everything changes back to that same time.  You can make new choices for the next 3 months, but after 3 months it won't affect your present timepath (the one where you are reading this).  It is like an alternative segment of reality but not affecting your current timeline.  "
93,"yeah you could imagine, but i had experienced."

What have you heard about them?

96,"hey, are you asleep ?"
97,"Nice, I will check those out lol"
98,"Good cutlery (knives, spoons, forks).  

Nice plates (not the cheap kind)

Toilet Paper.  When I first moved out (in the past), I quickly realized how much my gf (at the time) and I went through TP (and paper towels tbh).  

&amp;#x200B;

Helpful hint: Get a Costco card.  Buy the biggest package they have.  Saves so much time."
99,"1.  I currently have one
2. J's my only alter so it's gotta be her lol
3. I love to write. J loves sports (yucky)
4. I go inside. I lose all control of everything physical and usually go to the place where J usually stays. If I actively listen to her, I can feel pressure on certain parts of my head
5. As of now, nope!
Thank you of the lovely questions!

110,Exactly like that yes:/ 
111,That’s why they’re selling their body since they lack basic mathematics skills lmfao.
112,"yeah exactly, it's like a grooming type question? I'm a little worried now creeps will try to take advantage of her in this situation. Hey /u/SandraBonilla pls remember to not answer any personal questions about yourself, this is reddit and people are not always what they seem. Don't answer any further questions about anything other than this situation and don't give specific details. Furthermore, don't send any pics of yourself to anyone at all."
113,When did you find out about your alters?
114,"Wow this is really interesting to read about.  When I was younger I read the books When Rabbit Howls and Sybil.  I think Sybil turned out to be a fake but Truddi Chase was a real story.  I remember that her alters had different preferences and she had like 7 different shampoos, one could speak French fluently even though she ( Truddi ) never learned it , and even their handwriting was different!

I imagine that some of this maybe true with you as well?   

Also what happens with an alter when they aren't in control?  Like say you were in control for 20 hours of the day and your alter was in control for 4 hours.  What is life like for the alter during that 20 hours?  Is it like they are asleep ?  

Oh and Do they ever fight you for control?"
115,Jeans or sweats?
116,Because it’s the first thing I would have asked. 
117,Are you going to buy a lottery ticket now?
118,How are you with math? Look up dyscalculia. 
119,For the military? If so how can I get yall to leave me alone on Facebook I already have PTSD I dont need it worse
120,"Thats what i also wondered, i cant wrap my hand around it because its a bit too wide and tall so i have to use both hands, or maybe you can find a way to use it all with one hand, but i guess this no longer becomes the issue after you get use to it"

126,"For example, what if these alters wanted to get you comfortable with them knowing that you wouldn't want to be around a lot of people of they were negative. Then one day youre in a crowd or with family/friend and you turn murderously violent. "
127,"Would I be accurate in describing you and your alters as separate beings of consciousness *within* the system? How would you describe the transition, from Bap's perspective to J's perspective, to those of us having a hard time picturing the experience?

Thanks!"

133,That sounds scary but cool guy. I'd love to have a cool personality thing step in for me sometimes.
134,"I'm pretty sure this is the same troll I called out earlier today for pretending to be a conservative black American. He's a run of the mill troll. Don't hate him, he'll cry to the mods and get you banned, like he did to me."
135,"Nice to meet you and J! Do your tastes in music, clothing, food, etc change with each alter? "
136,"Can you embrace this feeling?

Do you look at this situation as something negative od positive?"
137,"You say J is athletic, do you mean that your physical abilities change when the alters take over, your muscle memory is separated for each alter, or your preferences in activities change?"
138,"Not particularly exciting, but a bunch of people often have questions. Your career is one of the most important components of your life in many cases, and people often wonder what happens ‘behind the scenes’. "
139,What's your biggest fear
140,I got a gf
141,What about a lie detector? Better than nothing...
142,Thank you. Don't be surprised if I do sometime.
143,That doesn’t make sense people who have sex with their gender is because that’s how they are why would you continue to have sex with men? Try a woman?
144,"Hey Bap, sorry if I misunderstood this (also sorry for bad Englando) but in a previous answer you said you currently only have 1 identity. This means it's you (Bap) +1 identity: J? This confused me a lot, sorry if it's a dumb question. This ama is a really good read, thanks for doing it."

155,"Well currently im trying not to masturbate, but because im 17 its real hard. It's eaither masturbation or getting a hard on if i so much as think about something suggestive. And typically. When i do masturbate i focus on the exp which is less pleasurable, so I've tried making toys and lube and that really improves it alot. Sometimes i practice healthy fantasy but in all its just kinda a slippery slope so i don't unless im feeling really confident. But sometimes i write my own erotica and try to keep it healthy. Its s little harder to slip into objectification if you're actively writing the scenario"

168,Did anyone grab your dink?
169,"Roughly 20% came in, in the form of crypto. We didn't keep any of it, as we transferred immediately to fiat. We're building a business, not speculating - we have mouths to feed. ;) "
170,"No way. Teddy was sick. There was definitely something he didn't tell us. Porn addiction makes you less sensitive and somebody may build up to disgusting porn but the terrible porn. Kiddie porn, coma porn. Coma kiddie porn, thats the worst... Is brought to you by. Typically a shitty childhood exp. I dated a girl once who was into cadavers. That was just a culmination of sexual abuse, parental abuse and sexual abuse. She started on legal gore porn on the normal web then graduated to full blown necrophilia on the deep web. There wasn't a build up from porn addiction. She went straight to depravity. But that's just one of a host of ideas and theories"
171,"That is good advice as well.  Get a costco card if you can, but whatever you do, get it in bulk.  

Also, make a lot of something (pasta, chicken, etc.) and eat it a few days for lunch during the week.  It saves so much $$$ and time to not have to think/pay/plan where you are going to on your lunch hour."

176,"I sort of knew the whole time but I couldn’t accept it until i was older and had been through more therapy. before i couldn’t handle even thinking about it so i pushed it way way way down. and hypersexuality for me a compulsive urge to act on sexual impulses even if they’re not desirable. and ect is electro convulsive therapy, it’s a treatment for mental health issues that involves medically induced seizures.

You suggested drinking.

189,It's none of those. Seek help from a therapist
190,There is no hope for you. Seek therapy or live knowing you will be alone forever with that attitude. Women can see when someone is as pathetic as you. I just wanted to try and help but you don't want help. You want to bask in your self pity 
191,Dude i'm telling you why you're single and friendless and you won't even hear it. It's because of who you are. I don't go out much either and I have lots of friends
192,So do you also have a beast personality like split. Just kidding but have any personalities tried to hurt each other?

I played poker with a fella who did the same job as you.

You never know who you're shakin' hands with."
196,"It doesn't only release during sex, you absolute boomer."
197,"&gt;For a sexual person, sex with another person is better than masturbation for a variety of reasons

no, you're wrong.  For a sexual person....each person is different.  In a way masturbation is much *easier* so for many people that becomes a habit that basically means 'better'. For some, who have low confidence, it fulfills a void they feel is unfulfilable in real life, or they were hurt in relationships and 'retreated' to porn

if someone claims to be asexual yet has been pornfapping the whole of their lives...I assert they do not know what they are until they take a significant amount of time abstaining from their pornfap habit to see what happens.
