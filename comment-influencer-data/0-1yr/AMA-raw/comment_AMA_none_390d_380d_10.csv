0,My daddy is a real good man and he does the journalism. 
1,How many Adidas track suits do you own? 
2,Who is your daddy and what does he do?
3,Czechs out.
4,Been there. I suggest crying and screaming and then telling your family everything is fine when they knock on the door but it isn't fine... Best of luck!
5,Are you 17
6,How does one simply...give up sugar?
7,"I am a lifeguard right now and a fun fact about me is that I have been to every state in the USA, but have barely been out of the country. "
8,RIP OP’s inbox
9,"Oregon, it’s so pretty and I like the atmosphere. "
10,"I|ve got like 12 of my own, but I frequently borrow new ones."
11,"My focus was on refined sugar. Primarily drinks. I allow 5 grams of fruit sugar a day, but rarely hit it.

Changes: 

Skin - I never realized how bad my skin was until i quit eatting sugar. I have had friends comment about my skin multiple times in the past few days and they know nothing about my diet. My skin just feels and looks 100x better. My face looks more vibrant. I used to get small patches of flaking skin that would turn red and hurt, some kind of psoriasis. My eyebrows would always have dry skin underneath and big patches would flake off and burn. 4 days after quitting sugar they were back to normal for the first time in months.

Sleep - i feel tired at night. I used to have horrible insomnia. I would force myself to lay sown at 5:00am because it was getting light outside. Not i start to genuinely feel tired at around 12:00am. I wake up less throughout the night and i feel far more rested when i wake up. I used to lay in bed for hours after i woke up. I always felt so tired and shitty, i just couldnt get out of bed. Now i wake up feeling rejuvinated and ready to go. I now wake up about 3 hours before i used to.

Mood - ive dealt with depression my whole life. I havent seem huge changes, but ill take the small ones. I generally feel more energetic and happy. Socializing feels a lit more normal and enjoyable. I notice that i smile more.

Migraines - Ive had chronic migraines since i was 4. Ive tried about everything for them with little result. I have had a noticeable improvement in my migraines since quitting sugar. Normally i would be at around 5 or 6 migraines in this two week period. I have only had 4.

Mental - it just feels good to accomplish something that was very difficult for me. "
12,We have to squat even while walking. Lifetime sentence if seen not squating
13,Not a question. As some one older than you who has had similar dry patches. I would say the longer you do nothing the more you will regret it later. Decide what you want: a relationship or FWB. If you have never had a FWB try it. You can always stop it if you don't like it. Also don't worry too much about your looks (which are probably better than you think they are). Many men are easy. I am sure you would be surprised how many 20+ men have FWB type relationships with 40+ women. I hope others here will confirm this. You can find FWB or a relationship through internet dating (remember to be safe when meeting strangers). You only live once and deserve happiness (and as many orgasms as you like).  
14,my funny comments lady geez 
15,It feels exactly like what molten iron looks like. 
16,"I just want to say thank you for not titling this ""Bored, AMA"". Well done!

Peanut butter - creamy or crunchy?"
17,"Holy....
I can only dream of free ketchup here"
18,Vaseline around the brown eye before pooping. It will help minimize contact. 
19,"Serious piece of advice. 

Run a cool shower, get in, lean forward, pull your cheeks slightly apart and let it rip. The cool water will sooth your burning log snapper. Then just waffle stomp that firey bad boy down the drain and you're all set. "
20,Favourite state and why?
21,......
22,Only a few times. Maybe five. I work in a female-dominated industry in a rural area. I have low energy levels and rarely go anywhere besides work.
23,Czech Republic
24,I haven't had sex in 17 years
25,"&gt; the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.  
&gt; make sure that you're well prepared  
  
I'm going to prepare myself by not eating a ghost pepper.

"
26,It’s been good actually! I have had some struggles with mental health for a lot of my life but I am starting to figure things out with proper treatment which makes me and my family happy.
27,That hurt my soul a bit
28,The one that isn't stored in big cheese blocks in the freezer
29,Free my man. 100% free. You can take as many as you'd like too. 
30,"Well i technically could've said ""mommy i feel like a boy"" when i was 10 and i would've gotten put on testosterone instead and would've grown to look like any other man. The problem with that is that i don't have a penis or a vagina, so it was better for me to live as a woman with a vagina i had to dilate rather than live as a man... With a hole .. And no penis to speak of. I've never felt like a boy so i have no gender dysphoria, but i've also always been quite the tomboy my whole life. I've never worn makeup for example, other than when my friends force me to when we go out drinking. I have been in a 2.5 yr relationship before and we were eachothers first sexual experience, and he was also quite awkward and nerdy so he never had any problems with having a sexless relationship. I did things for him like anal and bjs, but only because i waa curious and was having fun with being sexual for the first time, although i had no real horniness or lust of my own. I only did things because he never pressured me and i thought it was fun to give to him sometimes, but i could never receive anything as i have no clitoris and i haven't dilated wide enough to have intercourse yet. We broke up last January, and i have since then experimented with a couple different guys im close with, but still no penetration. I'm currently putting in the effort to dilate to the point of being able to have pleasurable intercourse so that i had try to have hookups at parties with guys ive just met for the first time, thats a goal of mine in the near future. Thanks for your questions!"
31,"Literally happened a few seconds ago, but I didn't get to crying yet. Thanks for the heads up!"
32,Isn’t that the norm in Hollywood now?
33,"Its working out great. I got a job I really liked that keeps me really active and all of my coworkers have been really great and supportive. It made me start having to take care of myself and get proper rest.

As far as behaviors I'm working on that in therapy right now so kind of. "
34,As a woman I've been getting unwanted opinions on my appearance since puberty. No thanks.
35,"Pretty scummy list of practices there.  I won't be saddened at all to hear the media dragging them through the mud.

How long have you lasted here before your conscience got the better of you?"
36,Have you turned down sexual advances in the last 12 years?
37,Do you think Ricky’s still pissed?
38,"When I was 20, i don't know why but I had a random thought that I could just poop in the shower the same way people casually pee. It came out solid and just sat there on the floor of the shower. I never considered stomping on it so I just awkwardly side stepped out of the shower and scooped it out and carried it to the toilet. Not my best moment. "
39,What type of job do you do? And what might be a fun fact about yourself? :) 
40,"The reason I havent done it is how guilty i would feel if a member of my family (e.g. my son,, dad, brother etc.) needed a kidney and I was the only match. Is that a worry for you?"
41,"And technically they were chances to go on dates. No one has ever straight up asked me to bone, except maybe the odd cat caller here or there."
42,"Girl...everybody is pretty! Unless you’ve killed a person or are cruel to children and animals. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Don’t pay attention to society’s view. Base your beauty in self worth! With that said...I’d like to ask, if you could have a dog, what would it be??"
43,What type of sunscreen do you use?
44,I would pay off some of my student loans and buy something nice for my parents with the rest. 
45,Which country? 
46,"Too much.
Too fucking much...



(About 0.30USD fot 10 ml)"
47,I will now
48,How much do you guys charge for ketchup?
49,Bidet ftw
50,"It's weird. If you had told me this was going to happen before it did, I would have been pretty upset. I definitely feel shame about it. On the other hand, I'm also not willing to go out and try to meet men. I'm strictly average - looking--or was--and could look somewhat cute if I made an effort. I do want to lose weight, but mainly b/c my physical health is suffering. "
51,"I would like a dachshund mini and I’d like to name it Winky, please. And thank you 😇"
52,"&gt;No one has ever straight up asked me to bone

Ay gurl, wanna fuck? "
53,I would go to my best friend and turn on find a way to show him the old Greg YouTube video and keep repeating it until he knew the only person who would do that would be me
54,"No, not in real life. But there are plenty online. I'm moving to study abroad, and there I plan to date. It'd be stupid to do that here-way too much at risk. Even abroad it's fucking risky, cause word travels, etc. You have to be real careful.

Some of my teachers from school know (don't judge me, my academic work was the only place where I got to be myself). I also told a friend I was an atheist when I first realized it. She was so amazingly accepting about it. She doesn't remember now, though (or pretends she doesn't, we're not close). Can't say my other friends would've reacted the same, though. I know that for sure."
55,I feel good whenever citizens engage in critical thinking.
56,Creamy always 
57,"I tried it. It was a virus. No game ensued.

You’re welcome."
58,I won’t preach about how you’re out in the sun all the time so you should REALLY wear sunscreen. 
59,"I understand that. I have no history of diabetes or kidney disease in my family, so figured that was a risk worth taking. Also, just because you’re related doesn’t mean you’re a match or ok to donate. So your child or parent or sibling may need a kidney but can’t take yours. The person I donated to had 3-4 relatives try to donate and were not approved. "
60,"Well the only thing I can suggest is to eat a Carolina Reaper next, so this pain pales in comparison. Then you will need to eat, canned pepper spray? Whats hotter then a Reaper pepper?"
61,"Could you have potentially become anatomically male? Or otherwise could you have identified as male and acted accordingly? If so, what made you feel more comfortable being female? Have you ever been in a serious relationship? How has your condition affected your intimate life?"
62,I guard a lake and not really... mostly giving kids bandaids and looking busy. I’m always scared something will happen though. But I feel I would be prepared because I keep refreshed in CPR every week. 
63,"Sugary drinks, especially soda/pop. I love pop, like life itself. I grew up drinking a 2 or 3 cans a day and dont think i ever slowed down. If it wasnt pop it was sweet tea or lemonade. I would go out to eat and suck down like 3 cokes no problem. Im 29yrs old and a very healthy weight, so i never had a reason to stop. Working in a restaurant doesnt help, as i can drink all the free pop i eant while working."
64,"No no no, its ""ayy bby u wan sum fuk?"""
65,"I was very dehydrated and had a huge headache. It was just like 20 minutes for the summit and I told my friends (2 of them) That because it was so close they can just go for it and i will follow asap.

They were also feeling horrible, all of us were extremely dehydrated. (Not a single drop of water since 10.000 feet. But it was the third time i climbed the mountain so i thought that i was in my comfort zone.

So i told myself... okay.. just a 20 min nap and i’ll feel amazing... then I woke up after 11 hours surprisingly Shocked by that fact and  Without a headache and totally disorientated and extremely exhausted.
My stomach was not working. 
My mind was slow but i just Told myself... Stick to the plan, stick to the plan...
I just gave up on continuing to the top so i just waited for my friends to come down. (Even if they went through other side but i just followed the standard protocol)...

I waited for ever and never saw them! 
Until it was almost night time and i almost decided to go down and suddenly they appeared! All of them totally wasted but extremely happy.
They told me that they also had to take a “nap” up there cause otherwise they wont make it.


I have no idea what happened that day. We were super trained and never experienced altitude sickness like this before. I guess the oxigen levels on the blood that day + dehydration made it clear.
We just jumped down on the glacier and used it as a slide at least for 3.000 feet until we reached a trail. Then we felt immediately much more oxigenated!
My stomach worked after like 8 hours after reaching base camp.  "
66,"Yes, and they take it very seriusly."
67,My UPS driver helped a couple minutes when I was doing a brake job. Why is UPS so much better than fedex?
68,There is a lotr meme right there.
69,is that a result of quitting sugar or were you important before
70,"uhh yea i didnt need reconstruction to make an anus haha, but i didnt have any other hole down there. i did need reconstruction to make a urethra hole to pee from."
71,Put the toilet paper in the freezer
72,"What does ""pretty progressive thinking"" mean in a small, ultra-conservative town in Saudi-Arabia?"
73,"I met him a month ago, about 3 months after I started this process. Since then we’ve had a weekly breakfast. He’s a great guy and I’m glad we met. "
74,"I should really check out that episode then! Tbh im not even really that informed on intersex stuff, i just know about me and generally what it means. I support a ban on surgeries on babies for things that are needless, like removing a female's testes, but in my case there was no option but to perform surgery. My urethra was attached to my bowel since i had no pee hole, so that had to be reconstructed upon birth. 

Fun fact, the doctors recommended to my mom that she abort me because of the low chance of survival, but she was (and might still be) in strong christian faith and believed if god gave her a baby then it was what he wanted for her, and didnt abort me. And i lived, so here i am today, in bed with my phone at 2am telling strangers on the internet about it. Inspiring stuff."
75,"Hey, no question, just love and support &lt;3 You be you and fucking rock it!"
76,Can your daddy get me a job in journalism lol desperate 
77,"Working for Flight Centre (SA) was my last full time job and it was such a toxic work environment I swore to myself I would never work full time again. I quit after only 3 months of working for them. 
The team I worked with were all bitchy. I didn't follow their robotic sales method because I genuinely cared about the customer and refused to trick them or scam them out of their money. 
Also, I started working there in December, when EVERYTHING was sold out because it was DECEMBER. 
So, I didn't reach my targets. And then at the January Buzz Night, our area leader insulted the absolute shit out of us. So demeaning and cruel, while glorifying the people who made their targets WHO HAD BEEN WORKING THERE FOR YEARS and had a clientele to enable such things. 

Anyway, so February comes and I am called into ""counselling"". Same area leader. It was me and 3 other newbies. That woman spent about 2 hours insulting us personally, degrading us, trying her best to make us ashamed of ourselves or imply that we are stupid... It was seriously the worst anybody has ever treated me and I realised that day that the job just wasn't worth it. 

But wait, there is more. 

So a few days later I am working on a group package for about 20 people. Manager comes into work in a mood and starts insulting me for working slowly, taking too many smoke breaks, for not taking enough customers BECAUSE I WAS WORKING ON A PACKAGE FOR 20 FUCKING PEOPLE and implying that I was useless and stupid, and then the assistant manager decided to be bitchy to me for no reason too. Like... completely bullying me. Trying her best to make me feel small. 

So, I packed up my stuff, quit, walked out and have never felt better. 

That company is full of greed, and the people who work there are treated like absolute shit. 
People thought I was exaggerating how awful they are, but this... this is proof that it's not just me. 

Thank you for this. "
78,"Well, its a matter of personal opinion. We are both teamsters doing the same job but just wearing different uniforms. I see a FedEx guy on my route all the time, we wave to each other and when we are at the same stop, we chat for a minute and give respect. 

FedEx is NOT union, and MOST centers are franchised. So they get paid a FRACTION of what we get paid. However, they are not held to as high standards as UPS is. UPS is like the Navy Seals while FedEx is like Grunts. That does NOT take away from the value of their job, but there is a significant difference between the two. ALL FedEX drivers WANT to be with UPS, but its very hard to get hired at UPS. 

FedEx has a hard time with their ground deliveries. The past 10 years with the internet shopping, both companies are struggling to keep up. UPS is designed to handle packages (its in the name lol) and FedEx really only does letters and overnight stuff. 

Now keep in mind that if you live in an area that has low population, a driver might not have as much work and can have the ability to stop and help, or chat etc. But we cannot go home until every box is off the truck, so If I want to be home for dinner, I need to hustle. 

Also, FYI, we follow DOT rules and regulations, we cannot drive more than 14 hours a day or we will personally get handed a $25k fine and UPS would receive a $250k fine...so management is VERY keen to sending you help or taking you off the road LONG before the 14 hour mark. Although during peak around Christmas, I have been known to work 13.75 hours."
79,"Over the years, when I’ve seen a news story about kidney donation, I’ve thought “I should do that.” But nothing was ever right in front of me and I was never proactive about looking into it. Then I saw a flyer for a man who needed a kidney and I picked up the phone and called. I felt like a few weeks of my own suffering and the risks t me were worth it to save a life. "
80,"I was raped at knife point when I was 12. I have PTSD, a nerve disorder, and autoimmune disorder. I've broken 8 bones, had pneumonia 6 times, bronchitis twice, 8 bouts of strep throat. I've spent lots of time in hospitals. I always looked forwards to the dog visits. I want to bring that happiness into someone's day. "
81,"Stay strong 💪🏽 

- From a Lebanese atheist with a Kurdish atheist fiancée."
82,No. He fought pretty hard but we got it into him. Now he has 3. 
83,How is life treating you? I hope things are well. :)
84,"What are the “consequences”?

Does it burn coming out?"
85,Asking the real questions here
86,"Funny how just a few hours ago I listened to [this interesting podcast](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dana) about an intersex person who only at 50 found out about the surgery they had been subject to when they were a kid. In this case the parents where not too game about the situation, but of course that happened ages ago.

Has your family been supportive of you?"
87,Lol
88,"I love spicy food, I eat it with anything and everything, and I've also had ghost pepper sauce before and thought that people just over reacted. Ho Ho boy was I wrong.
The experience lasts for 10 minutes only but its the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life. If you're going to do it, make sure that you're well prepared not like I was. "
89,nah nah it’s “becky lemme smash”
90,CPR is terrifying! I am just a mom certified in it and I had to do it on a 5 year old a couple years ago who was blue at the bottom of the deep end! It took around 10 to 12 minutes to get her breathing and then paramedics arrived and she lived with no lasting damage at all. I hope you never have to do CPR. I can't go to a pool without severe anxiety now because I am watching and counting all the people to make sure no one is dying.
91,"What's the price there? I've always wanted to visit America so much, that's why I even started learning english in my spare time."
92,"Awesome and good luck to you! Definitely grab some old Nokia or something so you family and friends can at least reach you, not to mention emergency services"
93,I wouldn't recommend doing it again...just saying.
94,"Wow, that might just be a winner. But if you'd told teenage me that I'd one day be smearing vaseline on my anus, I'd probably have run away crying. ""I like girls, I swear, ohhhh nooo!"""
95,Have you found any other lesbians? Do you ever expect to have a love life in your country? Do you plan to move? Do you parents know? Or friends?
96,"How is it working out for you?  Did you change any behaviors, or patterns? "
97,Being a virgin at 17 is pretty normal.
98,100 as they would be cute because they are mini but I would have trouble fighting them. 
99,Life is like a jar of jalapenos.  What you do today can burn your ass tomorrow.
100,"You’re right... it’s just sticky and gross. How about I wear some on my shift tomorrow, deal? "
101,"Both, I'm sorry to say. In the last five years I've gained weight so probably more the latter.



"
102,"I mean, I liked it at the beginning, it was all fun and games, but the  more I go there the more it feels like a chore. It pays good, for a summer job. And I get all the food at half the price."
103,"Sometimes they are fine, but sometimes, oh boy, sometimes they could get outsmarted by a fucking toad i swear. And I work mainly in the kitchen, makin' burgers and stuff. Never been the cashier or anything."
104,Hahaha... I hate sunscreen. 
105,"If you got turned into a chicken and you had to communicate to someone that it was really you so that you could turn back into a human, who would you go to and how would you communicate with them? "
106,"Always. And when it's not, some other shit is"
107,Are you required by law to squat at all times?
108,Do you....work?   
109,"Everything is half the price.
"
110,Found the professional pooper. 
111,How do you feel about that?
112,This bitch wanted me to clean her table like 10 times becouse she poured ketchup over it.
113,How come that you still haven't posted to r/gonewild? 
114,"5 years: At a good place with my career and financially independent. I also want, no I need—honestly—a good support network of friends, who I can trust and that truly understand me. I especially want to friend queer and athiest people from here because I'll never fully find belonging abroad.. 

10 years: In a marriage of convenience, with a gay Khaleeji guy (that's also a good friend, someone who has my back). To pass as straight, yes, but to also have agency over myself. I also want to be a couple years into a relationship. 

50 years: I've never thought that far into my future. Until recently, I didn't think I'd live to see my twenties. I'll.. probably be distressed over how I've been lying to my family all these years.

Saudi is changing for the better, in many ways. But it won't when it comes to lgbt+ rights and the rights of religious minorities. At least not anytime soon. Maybe other places in the Middle East will, but not here. It's home to two holy sites, and so the Muslims are really protective over it ."
115,This guy doesn't fuck.
116,What’s your favorite memory you have with her? Or a funny story?
117,Is it true they give you special training to smile at strangers like Americans?
118,"186 cm, which is like 6'1 for my American dudes"
119,"Also, to note. I deliver in a very, very rich town. I'm talking like, if you're house was a million bucks, you're poor. These people order shit all day, so I mostly go to the same houses everyday"
120,"Was watching live footage of a drone and saw two Afghanis trying to have sex with a goat or donkey, but they couldn't hold him still, so they shoved the animal out of the way and had sex with each other."
121,"Haha its funny because i personally think the hole look really bad and off, but my doctors have been really pleased with how it's turned out and try to tell me it looks great. You can clearly tell i dont have a clitoris and its just not shaped the same generally, but tbh i think it might start to look a lot more similar to a normal vagina once im done dilating to a big enough size, oddly enough."
122,"If someone gave you $10k, realisticly what would you do with it?"
123,"This was my exam. 

Walk on a slack leash with no haltee, choke collar or harness in a variety of areas (Crowd, milling crowd, walker assisted crowd, loud crowd) without pulling, barking or appearing frightened.


Refusing food from a stranger on command.


Meeting new people without aggression or fear.


10 people swarming her calling our her name.


Walking a pattern with her by my side.


Being friendly, didn't jump 


Vaccinatated / clean /well groomed"
124,"No. Cause I love them. And in Islam if your child converts, becomes gay, does any of the big sins—you pay for it, yes, but so do your parents. They're held accountable and are punished for it. And I don't want to cause suffering for them. "
125,What foods precisely did you give up and what changes did you notice?
126,Personal choice or lack of opportunity? 
127,"I'll have to check out that podcast tomorrow since im falling asleep right now, but yes my mother has been incredibly support live of my struggle my whole life. Taking me to every doctor's appointment and such. My dad was never really involved in my medical life though, he's a bit of a quiet type so its not really his thing"
128,You tryna fuck or not?
129,"There’s a chance a lot of them are lying. I remember when I was in high school this girl claimed she lost her virginity to some guy. A few years later I asked that guy if that was true and he said no. Also, it’s never a good idea to compare yourself to others. I know a lot of people that lost it in their 20s, including my bf."
130,Nice try TSA
131,"Not OP, but I live in the Czech republic as well. We are taught English in school's third grade (about 10 yo), and YouTube + Reddit do its thing. Most of my friends watch English youtubers regularly. I began on Pewdiepie, and I loved it. His English wasn't that great at the start, but he improved and so did I. Now I don't have any problems, I can think in English, speak with foreigners and so on. I've visited London on my own, several times, and had no problems there.

TLDR: YouTube + other social media + movies in English with czech subtitles do it's thing"
132,A true genderneutral person
133,"I don't get the impression she's complaining as much as sharing
"
134,"Damn dude, your friends left you to fall asleep?   
How did you feel when you woke up and after you got home? "
135,And you did this as a 20 year old and you were sober? Rofl my gosh man 
136,"You've selflessly given somebody an incredible gift that can be truly life-changing. Thank you.

Dialysis sucks."
137,"Pride, boredom, curiosity, and a pinch of masochism. "
138,"I'm still kicking myself for putting it off so long that ABC beat me to it :-(

147,With a gun in one hand and a bible in the other. 
148,Left. They usually take the left because it’s easier to get to. 
149,Lifeguarding is cool! Are you a pool or an ocean guard? Any favorite stories?
150,"That is 100% sexual assault. I am so sorry that happened to you and I hope you are doing well. 

Did you not think your parents would believe you if you told them? 

Do you plan to report him? 

Are you worried about his preying on other kids he tutors?"
151,Thank god I live in Murica.

I need this so bad"
160,"Yea that's amazing. I am surprised on how many people offer water, soda, etc. I even get a burger at stops when they are cooking out. We work very hard and push our bodies to the limit every day (seriously, I worked manual labor jobs my whole life, and this is harder than construction.) So it's nice to know we are appreciated and respected in our field"
161,No
