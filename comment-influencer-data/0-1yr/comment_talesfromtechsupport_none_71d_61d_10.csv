Poor kid. Candy crush is an obnoxious app that does everything it can to annoy kids into spending money just to be able to play. Shame that he wasn’t aware of this apple bug but at least he was trying to find a more creative solution rather than just charging his dads credit card.
"&gt;come to find out not one person in my IT department ever wanted to end up in IT

I think that's your problem there.

Once you find an IT office with people who are all about tech stuff, you might find you fit in quite well."
"Time to make a ""good user"" wall chart and give this person a gold star for trying to use instructions and another start for stopping and asking for help when needed. If you don't have big pieces of paper to make the wall chart, don't worry. It won't fill up too fast."
I hate the fact that people can be so educated and so fucking dumb.
"Shame your HOD was so quick on the offence when simply asking you would have sufficed, no?"
"In this instance, it was a good lesson for all (not just myself, but HOD and others) that listening to the customer say that it will cause multi million $$ losses, doesn't necessarily mean that it will.  


It turns out (I forgot to put this in) that the PA had the intention of sending an email to a customer / client from their MGRs email, so that it didn't state it was from them. In their eyes, having it send from someone else looked unprofessional. Regardless if $MGR actually said to do this or not, the damage that could come of that is HUGE."
"She did try to blame OP for a multi-million dollar loss.  With numbers that large, even I would drop the niceties in favor of blunt professionalism."
"I hope so, I've never been made fun of for all the geek things I enjoy like this in an IT department so it's weird. They are like rednecks that like their trucks and guns and think anyone who likes video games are actually likes computers are nerds. It's just a weird situation..."
She also tore apart the hinges.
You replaced and ruled out parts for MOST of these pcs in an 8 hour day? I salute you. And this is my dream job.
Like the Monty Python scene but set in current climes.
"Wait so any hardware that comes into indirect contact with secret documents gets assimilated?

If you put a secret document on a USB drive and threw it at a TV would the TV become SIPR?  And would that happen before or after you were forcefully removed from the premises?"
"I hate the fact that people can be so educated and be such fucking arseholes.

I actually really hate it.

With a passion.

It’s such a betrayal of the gift of intelligence."
"back in the day, it used to be a game in and of itself to see how far you could break a games mechanics. Now the company pops your ball and takes you to court. Makes me wonder if games would have ever been as popular among kids if they had always done things like this and never had things like cheat codes."
"To be fair, the device comes with an easily changeable setting which is like a self-destruct button. The manufacturer has some culpability."
"My wife read the manual end to end for an ISP billing system. There were quite a few Easter eggs in the manual. 

When she could not figure out a report she called into tier1 tech support to ask. 

Her: Hello, this report keeps failing and it is not ‘a full blue harvest moon in a Thursday’. What should I do?

Tier1: Hold on, let me get you transferred. 

Actual developer answers: OK, so we know you read the manual, let’s see what might be the problem... oh, and this number xxx-xxx-xxxx will bypass tier 1 and get you to one of our devs directly. Thanks for spending the time to research before calling."
Literally it's going to be a post-it with one name and a handful of stickers.
"Working in tech support for ~6 years (fuck my life) leaves me to think that his “restart” was closing and reopening the laptop lid.

Get a *lot* of the “yeah I rebooted it” from users who turned the monitor off and on because they think the monitor is the computer."
Did she cut the ribbon cable? Isn't that replaceable?
"I learned pretty quickly that this is a job actually worth quoting a customer. While it IS an immense waste of time, you'd be shocked just how many people will go for it. Charge something reasonable for the work involved and it becomes a very profitable afternoon."
Jesus that's a good effort / reward ratio. Nice work.
"You know, there are three words that explain why [*Mando'a*](http://mandoa.org/) is my favorite constructed language: *Kaysh mirsh solus*. In English, this means  ""His brain cell is lonely."""
Trust me... its not. I used to work for a company where I built PCs all day long. It sucks.
Most amount of money I have ever received at one point in my entire life. Outside of when I got reimbursed for my accident.
"&gt; What is the reasoning behind replacing the monitor, mouse and keyboard?

Military Intelligence.

&gt; What is the reasoning 

MILITARY.

INTELLIGENCE."
"Hey, even basic troubleshooting (looking publicly) and an issue where being upset is totally understandable.  
I hope Judy goes to heaven... you know, once she's dead."
"Yeah, having soft skills is almost more important at times than having technical skills.  Half of what IT does is google anyway ;)

\&gt;   I get made fun of constantly for having a mechanical keyboard 

To be fair; if its one of those loud ones and you're in a shared office space you're getting off lightly if they're just making fun of you for it."
"Unless i did the math wrong, you only got 6k (200 pcs x 30 per). Regardless, that's a good amount for a couple days' work."
"I usually treat the support policy as describing the _minimum_ effort required. There's no compulsion to exceed that. Even ignoring altruism, we're all in this together: Investing in other people helps ourselves."
"We call ours 'WoW's (Workstation on Wheels) where I work. They used to be called 'CoW's (Computer on Wheels), but there was some confusion and outrage when one was in a patient room and someone was overheard saying 'check out the cow in room X'"
"Not indirect contact, but anything that held classified data. This includes a monitor that displayed classified data, but I don't know about other peripherals. I doubt data cables would count.  If you used an hdmi cable to hook up your TV to a classified device,  I don't know if you would have to actually view something on it or if just hooking it up would taint it."
"Did the user break terms of service by resetting ""your"" router?"
"Nope, their router. As they buy equipment and hours without any sort of service agreement, they can do anything they want with it.

Normally I would have put them in line behind any other pending work because of it, but it was completely dead that week anyway."
An actual (https://xkcd.com/806/)[Shibboleet] in the wild?
"&gt;$Client: “As soon as possible. We can’t work like this, you really should make sure your gear works. I think we pay for better service than this.”

&amp;#x200B;

This line threw me. Thats why i thought it was your equipment."
"Definitely, I blame Apple for this one. It's ridiculous that you can brick your device simply by changing the wrong setting to the wrong value."
"The school should just offer her a refund and remind her that online classes require computer knowledge. Also, shame on the son for not telling her that last part before. I know my dad is pretty computer illiterate besides having a smart phone, so I would NEVER let him take an online course."
"Some people don't want the most economical or logical fix, they just want the fix. Like putting your third transmission into the same car because you like the car."
"I’m almost 40 and have a corner shelf with “robot stuff”. Some of its new some of its old. I have a giant transformers 20th anniversary lithograph, some of our most prominent clients have seen it from the hall and stopped in to look at it."
What the client buys and what they think they are buying are often two entierly different things.
"I suppose, shame I never found out if they were able to solve their problem. I genuinely hope that they got it fixed. Still kinda blows that he tried to cheat the game but considering how that app was structured I can imagine he'd try it that way. Not that many people in the Netherlands even have credit cards, so I suppose he saw this as his only way to get a bunch of points quickly and for free."

"I work for a childcare company that has iPads for the students to use. We see it happen every now and then.

Toss the iPad into DFU mode and reflash. Nukes the iPad but it works after. *Backup pictures first since that will still work."
