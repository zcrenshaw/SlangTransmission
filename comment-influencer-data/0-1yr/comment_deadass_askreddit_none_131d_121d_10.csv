"I live in New York, and a few months ago I was in the city and there were these tourists from another country who spoke a little broken english, but still understandable to someone who speaks english, having a conversation with a new yorker right next to me. Funniest thing, the new yorker kept using “NY slang” such as “its mad cold” and he kepts using “deadass”. The tourists tried to pick up on it, so he goes over to his wife and goes “you’re deadass amazing” (which was cute to me) but i guess she had no idea what deadass meant b/c she slapped him and scoffed. Non- New Yorkers man."
