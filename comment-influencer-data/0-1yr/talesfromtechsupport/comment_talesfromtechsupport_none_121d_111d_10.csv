"Ah, this reminds of phonecalls with relatives that went similarly.

""My computer gives me an error when I start it. What's wrong?""

Well, what does the error say?

""I don't know""

Does it happen every time you turn it on?

""Yes""

Turn it on for me. Ok, so what does it say?

""I dunno""

Are you not looking at it right now?

""No. I clicked the cross thingy""

Right... shut down the computer, turn it back on again, and then, DO NOT click the cross thingy.

Are you looking at the error now?

""Yeah""

What does it say?

""I dunno""

But... you're looking at it?!

""yeah?""

So... what does it say? 

""Something something error. with OK and Cancel""

No I mean, what does it literally say?

""I dunno, that's why I called you!""

READ THE ERROR TO ME!

""I can't. I clicked OK""

siiiigh. Ok, turn it off and on again. Touch nothing. then read the words on the screen, without touching the mouse or keyboard.

""Your \[software\] needs to be updated to the latest version for automatic updates to be installed. Do you want to continue?"" 

groooooan. Click Yes."
Bespoke usually means 'expensive' in my experience...
"Right on. ""Bespoke"" means ""custom built without regard to cost"" as far as I'm concerned."
"All joking aside, I regularly trade IT skills for services.
I do IT for my acupuncturist, my chiropractor and my tattoo artist... I dont pay anything.
Also traded IT for a repair on my motorcycle.

Sometimes bartering is good."
"\&gt;  he may be a good programmer and just bad with ifs

Please fire your boss."
"Yeah. I remember one of my late shift calls. Back around 2005. I was grave shift support for a cell carrier. Got this lady who was in tears and desperate to set her phone up as a modem because she was out in the sticks without internet access otherwise. 

Turns out that she was trying to reach her husband who was deployed to Iraq and about to go to downtown Baghdad (front lines), so she was scared that she wouldn't be able to have another chance to see or talk with him again. Yeah. Got drivers installed, got configuration set up. Got it connecting. Took about an hour because poor Army Wife hadn't a clue how to handle the Control Panel, but it really was a life of death thing."
"User: I have this super critical laptop that I absolutely cannot live without under any circumstances.

Tech: Ok. Let's take a look at your backups.

User: *crickets*"
"If the customer is older ask if they remember cordless phones for landlines. The cordless phone needed to be put back on the base after a while to charge. 

The landline also helps to explain why you need an ISP. The cordless phone is comparable to a laptop with wifi. The ISP is comparable to the phone company."
"Selective dyslexia, where they can read just fine until its on a screen then they suddenly become completely illiterate."
Shouldn't a STEM grad student who wrote a program for a supercomputing cluster be capable of grepping through those files to find the one he wants?
Nah dude. Patch cable won’t do enough damage. Go grab an old IBM ThinkPad and beat them with that. It’ll still work afterwards and you’ll have gotten the rage out
"This scenario is basically like if someone already had a Savile Row off-the-rack suit that happened to fit perfectly, but decided instead they wanted to replace it with a JCPenney suit tailor-made 3 sizes too small."
"""You want me to disconnect the projector so you don't have the issue of forgetting to turn on the computer?""

I love how people that have trouble remembering the most basic instructions suggest we *add* steps to their processes to deflect blame. If you called their bluff I'm betting they'd want you to find a way to disconnect the projector that didn't require them to reconnect it when they wanted to use it."
Ironically they gotta clean out their cleaning supplies eh.
"See this far too often in the medical field.  No doubt in my mind they are extremely good at what they do. 

It frustrates me to no end when someone isn’t willing to learn something new that is absolutely critical to their job and then expect everyone else to do it for them. 

Wish we could say something like “If you continue to refuse learning you might hurt someone when nobody else is around to help you”."
"Rule number (something),

&amp;#x200B;

It's your fault/problem until you can PROVE otherwise."
"No. Like Tetris, your failures pile up and you successes are never seen."
"*customer walks into a tailor shop on Savile Row with a discount JCPenney suit*

""Hi, I need this bespoke, can you do it for five bucks?"""
"BUT! BUT!


NO WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED!!


NO TRANSACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE BANKS!!!



Bartering is good."
"Quick call tech support, we need some guidance to completely ignore."
"&gt; If you do not know, inside every portable meter there’s a 9V battery. After all. How do you think it powers up?

How does one think a job can be had in this environment?"
"My friend's biological dad was in the Marine Corps and rarely was able to speak to him. The times he did he couldn't tell him where he was but would only tell him he was ""playing in the sandbox"" if he was on land or ""taking a bath/playing on the big rubber ducky"" if he was getting on one of the Navy's ships. 

The teacher's in high school knew this but one time his cell phone rings during class and it's a restricted government line. He picks it up immediately (you never know when the next time you get to talk to them, if ever, especially with his MOS) and the teacher told him this was an inappropriate time to talk. 

He rightfully so told her to fuck off and walked out. She didn't care nor did she apologize."
"Frankly, when our users see ""IMPORTANT"" and ""FROM IT"" in the email, I'm convinced they filter it into the trash. None of them ever get the emails we or the parent IT orgainization send out."
"Sound like he would love steam game ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"""
"Reminds me of every time I have to remote in to my mother's computer.

""Mom, stop touching the mouse.""

""I'm not.""

""Then why is the pointer moving?""

""...."""
"I doubt they will, they never learn. This is the kind of company that forgets to put switches on a ups."
"&gt; I took the longer route back to my desk to avoid as many offices as possible. 

But then you would get missed with the impromptu while I have you since users will walk up to you as you walk back to your office and make small talk. Usually in attempts to not use the ticketing system."
"""Oh quick question!""

""Quick answer.""

""I've got this problem where something.""

""What's the ticket number?"""
"He's a great editor, he just doesn't know his alphabet."
"I approve of this.

I do want to add, however, that patch cable can also be a good option, as long as it's converted into a Cat5-o-9-tails, since it then acquires the necessary ""oomph"" to get your point across and be painfully clear on what your point is."
"Also, I don't think *anyone* wants to be an Old Phone Guy any more, as it's a dying tech with everything new moving to VoIP. (Which most big Nortel chassis could probably support, to be picky.)

I did my time on a TDM PBX and it was very similar (except I never got 5k for a day's work). On-site support was occasionally necessary to keep The Beast functioning, but it supported tons of calls with the CPU equivalent of a couple potatoes. I think when I moved on in 2015 the CPU was dual Pentiums?"
Is that allowed? It’s a good example of why shadow IT is bad and she’s keeping company information on an account the company has no access to.
Keep us current.
"[What is ""dead"" will never die, and we still have to service the goddamned thing](https://i.imgur.com/RZHCtoZ.jpg).

In a pinch, you can also use an old Nokia, or a modern Netgear switch (I only say Netgear because the ProSafe has a lifetime no-questions-asked warranty, so once you beat the user to death, you can RMA it for new gear because of blood spatter)."
"My boss had a cloned HDD for this laptop in his desk at a different location. That was my absolute last resort if this didn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than this user's handwriting recognition, nothing critical was on the laptop. He used a desktop in his office to edit his documents and such, but his laptop was his main tool while seeing patients. The EHR programs were just RDP sessions to application servers, so he still would have been able to do his job with a different laptop."
Rule 0: User is ALWAYS lying.
"holy shit a grad student not making his / her own physical backups as well as a cloud backup of important files is crazy to me. Literally the first thing they teach you in high school computer class is if a file doesn't exist in three separate places, it does not exist."
"That district manager should have gone beet red. As well,  piss poor training, lack of knowledge and an unprofessional attitude from her employee.  I'd say you made the right choice."
"I know those feels. I used to work for a local cable ISP as well, and there were at least a few calls where I had to explain, ""Grasp the thick plastic connector on the thin black cable, and gently pull it out of the modem.""

And more than once, someone would be looking at it and not understand what I'm saying. I confirm, they see the cable. They see where it plugs in. But they have no idea what I'm asking them to do. It's a totally foreign concept to them.

One woman actually insisted that she, in all her 80 years on the Earth, has never once ever seen a power cable, or heard of ever unplugging anything."
"Why does it cost so much to build a house, we drew up the blueprint already."
"I remember those kind of calls, or the kind where they call, but have all of 1 minute to talk to you because they are busy or have to leave. Why the hell did they call in the first place, then?"
"that literally does happen. schedule a 'server maintenance session' (aka scream test) just before lunch (like 15-20 mins), announce it only via e-mail in advance (multiple times) and then wait for the screams. You'll quickly find out who reads their emails and who ignores/auto-trashes them."
"Once you realise they keep closing the dialog box, hang up.

When they ring back, hang up immediately. Do this a few times until you hear the frustration in their voice.

Calmly tell them that basically what they're doing every time they close the dialog box"
"I'm kinda surprised the company would foot the bill for all that; heavy equipment is expensive, especially compared to  the relatively cheap expense of literally walking up to site. I'm making the assumption that this isn't in the US; I've been on similar jobs, and we have steps to take for this kind of thing. Utilities can force easement on property owners who landlock infrastructure assets, police intervention, that kind of thing.  


I've actually also been on a job where we were denied access to the site, by the equivalent of 1/2-2/3 methhead (not quite full methhead, because he still managed to own the property next door. Never go full methhead.). Simple solution, call police, police escort us to utility, methhead come out to confront us, officer has a chat with methhead, turns out methhead has active warrants, methhead takes a free taxi. Problem solved."
