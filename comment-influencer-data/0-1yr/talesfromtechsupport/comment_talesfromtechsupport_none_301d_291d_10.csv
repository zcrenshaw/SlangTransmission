"Yup, been there. Old dot matrix printer that I had just returned after having it serviced. I made it two blocks before they called to tell me that it wasn't working.

I look at and immediately see the problem and solve it. As the printer begins making an ungodly amount of noise (as dot matrix were wont to do), the user runs up and asks me what I did.

Smart alec me says, ""The primary AC actuator was improperly positioned."" wait for blank stare ""It was off."""
The worse bit is that the majority of color sight problems is on the red-green scale. So of course we use red and green for our most important functions.
"&gt;Thanks to our overly cautious colleague who went station after station and made pst files beforehand.

Sounds like someone is owed a beer. Possibly several beers."
He’s lucky you didn’t fire him after the first water bottle offense. 
"This reminds me also of when I assist a customer, they describe the issue, I remote into their PC, then they proceed to tell me this isn't the PC having the issue, this PC is fine. The one with the problem is miles away at their home"
"At my job, I got tired of the same situation.  I had a few supervisors that didn't want to use it.  So, I told them if they didn't put a ticket in, I would create one for them and make it look goofy.  I could literally make it look like they sent it.  That fixed some.

The others, I eventually would have them walk up to me, because i, on purpose, would be slack on checking their emails, telling them the truth, that I am very busy.  So when they came over, I would ask them if they put there ticket in.  They would say no.  So I stated, ok, I will meet you in a minute or two, just let me finish this.  While you are waiting, why don't you put that ticket in.  After about 10-15 times, they started to figure it out, and just started putting tickets in."
"&gt; She presses the CD button on the multi-function remote and nothing happens, 


At this point I thought for sure that the problem would turn out to be a flat battery in the remote, and that they'd dragged you all the way down there just to change the battery.
"
"&gt; No, you won't try to do your best, you will do your best and you will fix it.... I've already tried that, I'm not an idiot. You IT-people are all the same, thinking users are dumb. God!

I'd like to speak with your manager, immediately.

If ANY user thought they could talk like that to me, very quickly they'd find that it wont happen a second time. I am there to do a job, as with any job, politeness goes a long way.

Speak like that to me, and you will find that you will be the bottom of priority lists, if I ever decide to deal with you again. We've had users removed for such behaviour. 
"
"I was tempted.  Very tempted.  I was still new to the company and my boss said ""well give him another chance, he's always been so good before.""  Me personally finding the water bottles there, when he KNEW I was coming (since I had to fly across the country) did convince my boss to set the wheels in motion to promote someone else.  Even he was livid at that one.

Edit: Apparently he was really good at phone support.  Though he often complained, without a hint of irony, how the users never gave enough information."
 There's apps that can name colors seen from the camera.
"It wasn't *off*, it was in *silent mode*."
"There's also one that will do an AR overlay and shift colors to a range colorblind people can see based on the type of colorblindness they have. There was a post on reddit a few years ago that was video of some guy using it on the  Ishara Color Plate Tests (you know, the ones with spots of color making numbers) and laughing and crying at the same time as he was finally able to see what was on there. "
"She's always making noises when I'm trying to investigate Firewall rules or something far more important, but because I sit next to her, I eventually have to engage.  The fucked up thing is she's chosen to use human signifiers for pain while she ""works.""  The other day she just kept saying ""OW.""  ""Ow, ow, ow!""  I'm half tempted just to go to HR and tell them she's nuts."
"What you have to do for something like that is let it marinate.

You finish the job, collect payment, finalize paperwork etc.

THEN you thank them for their time in their language."
"Company I work for sells power filters to put between our lease equipment and our clients shitty, noisey electrical systems.

Now these power filters unfortunately have 3 outputs on them so I'm constantly finding cellphone chargers and the like plugged into them. No biggie. Every so often it's something like a pencil sharpener or kurig, strongly worded lecture about warranties usual precede customers learning to play nice.

But one time I was called in to a brand new unit installed in a newly renovated office location. It was just power cycling at random and throwing every code in the book. Issue was very quickly apparent. They had plugged a mini fridge into the clean side of the filter. Ofcourse they claim that's not the issue, that's it's the equipment's fault, fully ready to die fighting for that hill. Till, right in front of us, the compressor on the mini fridge kicks on and the machine freaks out and power cycles.

Some really smart people can do some otherwise really dumb stuff sometimes"
"&gt;Next day, one of my colleagues from the Sales department told me he canceled his service with us.

And there was much rejoicing."
"&gt; I eventually have to engage.

Dear GOD, no.

Just plug your headphones in, even if you're not actually hearing anything through them, and let her bitch and moan all she wants.

Also, CYA and start complaining about her constant loud interruptions, so she can at the very least be shoved away to somewhere she doesn't bother you."
"Refuse to provide any tech support for her in the future, if she asks why reference this moment."
You need to be smarter than the door to proceed.  *User fails INT check*
If I had a nickel for every time an employee didn't read the ticket... I definitely could have bought a pizza by now.
"I’m always amazed at the tolerance of people in this sub (for the most part).

In every IT support job i’ve had (non-customer facing), I’ve given just as good as I’ve received. If someone hits me with attitude, it’s thrown straight back. Hell, I’ve been known to tell managers “If you want it fixed, lose the attitude, or you can sing for it” (in other words, get fucked). "
This is a rather heartwarming story. If only more people would follow this example.
"&gt;No, you won't try to do your best, you will do your best and you will fix it.... I've already tried that, I'm not an idiot. You IT-people are all the same, thinking users are dumb. God!

I really, really wish more IT people had the leeway to tell users, ""We will not be spoken to like that. If it continues, management and HR will be notified and they will take appropriate action."""
"haha, people are just soooo strange!

I've already had quite a few calls of people not currently near their modem. I didn't figure this out in the beginning so I'd ask about cables and lights and they'd answer but the answers would not match up with what I knew to be possible and when I kept pressing for answers they'd admit they weren't near the modem. Like... why even? Why?"
oh wow. i never thought id read a story from the other side of a unicorn sighting. o.o
"I cover tech for 4 buildings, all at least 15 mins away from my office. Most are around the same distance or more from each other, so if I have a lot of tickets I'll end up doing a lot of driving.

A lot of users decide that instead of a ticket that they will just stop me when they see me or that they will send me an email. I will respond to questions on how to do things, but if it's a service request I'll say something along the lines of ""I will try once I'm done with this stuff, but please put in a ticket because I'm liable to forget otherwise with everything else going on"".

I had one person who wanted some hardware installed. Every time I was there she would see me in the hall and ask me about it and I would reply that way every time. Thing is, I was swamped. There was never time to swing by and install it after I was done with other tickets, because it would be time to clock out before I could finish everything. So for three weeks she would ask me about it in the hall. For three weeks I said I'd try, but please put in a ticket. Finally, she put in a ticket. I happened to be going there that day, so I got it done and closed it. She doesn't stop me in the hall in the air as much anymore."
"Sounds like a candidate for PtU (Promotion to User).

Though Unemployed would also fit."
"I forgot to add; I picked my monitor and my docking station from his office and set them up myself. The same with my 'confidential printer' which was not on the network; I downloaded the drivers from the manufacturer's website. Some pretty basic shit, but you wouldn't have thought so from the way his eyes glazed over. 







He's now my best buddy. I've met his wife and kid, he's gifted me knitted booties for my kid, and we WhatsApp and IM with more emojis than your typical preteen girl (you'd find his emoji usage absolutely hilarious if you knew him in person, and I decided to just roll with it)."

"Pretty much this. Colourblindness is hardly an issue in 99.9% of life, at least for me. But why in tarnation do we still have amber?"
"I have an intricate folder system for all my emails. It was briefly mocked, until someone needed an email from a year back and I had it 20 seconds. I don't think I've deleted an email on my work account since I got there."
"(grips chest) He wanted to upgrade *Production* applications to the preview version of an unsupported OS...and he was a *Team Lead*.

"Amateur hour mate. ""Hmmm, you're right, it *is* a bit slow. I'll take it back to the workshop and run a defrag and file integrity scan; should have it back to you by tomorrow afternon, they day after at the latest"". Do this until she stops asking."
"""You are not my superior, you are my colleague. And there's a disciplinary policy for people who talk to their colleagues like that."""
Your goddamn printer is a unicorn. My printes does not work when i use original cartridges
"You work at a 3 person office, I see."
"Same here. During a review one year, my VP said that 'johnny5canuck doesn't suffer fools gladly"". I was good with that.

I believe that was mainly from a time when 2 very senior marketing people barged into my office, demanding training for Microsoft Office. I kicked them out."
"Would it have been completely out of the question to **try** transferring a file (or small test file) after sending the initial email, but before sending the followup emails like a crazy person?  

I know logic and reason escape some people, but she could have checked the ticket or attempted a file transfer, but instead she sat unable to work for hours... which means she was probably wasting time and sending you an email trail to cover her own arse."
"Just today, I uploaded an SSL cert in txt to our vendor's ticketing portal to apply to one of our websites. I said to rename the txt to cer. They asked me to ""please provide the file in the correct format""."
...and he's STILL employed?!?
"I could not agree more. Once a client came via a ticket claiming ""My website gives a 5xx error"" so we tested it and we were unable to recreate the issue on our end. This is why we asked him with step-by-step instructions on how to recreate it. His answer was:

&gt;How to prvide step-by-step instructions?

\*Hits head on the desk\*"
Probably because beige alert sounds a bit neutral. And as we all know - you cannot trust neutrals.
"bottom of the priority list, and with a throttled internet connection for anything remotely non-work related."
"Heck, I once had something like that in meatspace.

&amp;#x200B;

I was working at a law firm and this one lawyer, we'll call him Mike because that was his name, had spent some of his own money on a fancy ergonomic wireless keyboard, one of the really top end ones I think it cost him around $150.

He phoned me up one morning because he thought I'd done work on his computer and accidentally taken his keyboard. I hadn't, but I told him I'd poke around and see if it had been moved by someone. It was nowhere in the office.

We're doing the detective thing, trying to figure out what might have happened. The dongle was still in his computer, and this was back before bluetooth had become widespread enough that wireless stuff mostly worked on universal dongles, without that one specific dongle his keyboard was useless to whoever had taken it.

I'd brought down a wired keyboard for him to use in the meantime, and we tried to reconstruct what might have happened. He explained that his desk was kind of small so when he was done with the computer he moved his keyboard off the desk, and showed me how he did that.

&amp;#x200B;

He put the wired keyboard on top of his trash can. Not \*\*IN\*\* the trash can but sitting across it. 

&amp;#x200B;

And as soon as he did his eyes got big and he said ""Damn."" Because we'd both just realized what had happened. The night before he'd had paperwork to be doing so he'd left his keyboard on the trash can all afternoon, and hadn't touched his computer. It was, apparently, the first time he'd done that instead of checking his email before leaving work, and that evening the janitor must have emptied his trash can and thrown the keyboard away.

That's the story of how he bought a new super fancy ergonomic wireless keyboard and stopped putting it on the trash can when he wanted a bit more desk space."
Always give them chance to dig a deeper hole. 
"Incompetence is one thing, but absolutely refusing to follow policy after multiple warnings, and giving you attitude when asked to do the needful? That's someone in dire need of downsizing. "
"Sorry ma, I just don't wanna break anything else"
"i slowly learnt the importance of asking the customer to do a reverse battery reset on their remote.

All it really does is verify that they have the batteries connected properly without me having to argue about whether it is connected properly or not. "
"Wasn't on my team, but yeah, he survived it."
"You specified ""must work with dual monitors"".  They didn't test it.  That's enough reason to lose their number."
When I suspect remote isn't working due to a battery problem asking people if the battery is plugged in properly often meets with resistance over the phone. So instead I say let's do a reverse battery reset on the remote. This way they open up the remote right away instead of the usual stuff that my batteries are fine.
