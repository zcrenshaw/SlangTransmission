"&gt; The software ran exactly as it was supposed to. There were no problems fron the developers

I disagree with that.  Nobody working on finance software should ever be using floating point numbers, for exactly the reason you ran into: it's imprecise.  You store money as an integer, in cents or an even smaller unit (depending on what your exact needs are).

Floating point money is fine for general use (e.g. games), but using it in any system that handles actual money is completely irresponsible."
Computers are stupid all the time. It's just that often humans are stupid*er*.
"Depending on where in the world you are, quite a few of those electrons probably are coming from a coal fired steam turbine, so you wouldn't be wrong, exactly."
"We call these 'piggyback' tickets.  This thing is broken, oh by the way this other thing that is totally unrelated to the main thing is also broken.  I always force them to resubmit rather than tasking it out. They'll complain, but that's how the servers are fueled - user complaints and tears."
That's why you never go cheap on display fluid. 
"I had forgotten about projection TV fluid.  

I had to maintain them and re-adjust the tube convergence all over our campus classrooms.  When the coolant leaked, bye-bye circuit boards.

We still have a bunch of wheels in the shop from those TVs that we use to make carts and dollys."
"Okay i used to work in retail in a college town...a rich college town...its saturday afternoon and im stocking a straightening up the candles these 2 college girls start smelling the candles and getting each other to smell various scents.

 Then one if them picks up an unscented candle and says ""ooh unscented! I wonder what smells like""  I was barely keeping it together.

she takes a sniff, a confused look grows on her face, she takes another sniff and then puts the candle down and in true rich girl fashion stomps her foot and says ""it must be defective or some cause i dont smell anything!""

I lost it i immediately put down my box and went several aisles away laughing so hard i think i might have coughed "
"One of my former supervisors, a Southern lady in her late 40's or so, used to call them ""cellar phones"". I wasn't aware they only worked in the basement, but ok...

This was the same lady who would later confuse the ever-loving hell out of me when she told me a report ""arrowed out""..."
"Only assuming the coal fired stream turbine is attached to an electric generator, of course."
"I prefer the illusion that a gerbil or hamster is running on a wheel inside my tower, thank you."
"It's all about them dirty energy speeds, bro. "
But then he would have just said “you’ll have to submit a separate ticket for the printer” 
We run a handful of macs in an AD environment.  Let's go have a beer somewhere and cry.

"Rules say no links, but hopefully instructions won't be met with the modhammer.

Go to Youtube, and search for ""Your product is trash, I want a refund."""
That must be one of those new Air servers I keep hearing about.   
I stand corrected. My only excuse.... to close to quitting time and the brain already shut down. 
"Love that episode. A close second was when the police bomb bot was running windows ME. Started the frantic running and ""We're all going to die""  

Love the whole show. "
"software didn't have validation in place

Oh little [Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/), what have you gotten yourself into now, you scamp."

Yes it has a small furnace and it literally burns batteries. What's this thing about recharging anyway?
Picture on wiki reminds me of Crimson Skies 
"funny, that would be my response. 


but then I had a boss who asked me to print off the internet so he could read it over at home. 

I think I had a mild stroke that day. "
Something you don't know plus something you don't have. The ultimate in security.
"&gt; just assumed the CD drive didn't work.

One would hope they'd come to this conclusion after trying it a few times, and then stop."
I think I smell Brimstone....
"&gt;Why though  

Because it was quicker this way. I thought OP covered this. "
"no it's a call back to arj which used to be theee cool dos archive file compressor.

It's still alive!"
"I don't get all the hype about it TBH. I never got past season 2 because it was literally just the ""who's shading who""show"
"I know what you mean about the heat, once sat my other half laptop on my legs once. Never did it again, had the Nvidia bonding issue so it's in computer hell now."
"I am stealing that saying, it is beautiful."
"I once had some servers on an internal hosting site where I had to use 2FA to VNC (over SSH, I think) to a proxy, then use separate 2FA credentials to VNC/SSH in to my server. All very impressive, except I found myself with admin access on someone else's server."
You don’t gave yourself away A A Ron!
LOL I had one of those at an old job. Thing should've been classified as a weapon and an NFA Destructive Device. 
"I know how to cook various things. It's just a lot more effort than I like to put in.  I'm not a big fan of spaghetti.  But pizza takes way too long to properly make, since you have to let the dough rise for a few hours.  You can make the dough in the morning but that means getting up extra early.

And then half the time something went wrong and the results suck.

I made a rack of ribs a month ago using a recipe that called for slow cooking it in the oven for hours wrapped in tin foil.  Worked great.  Then I tried it again the next week, and it turned out terribly.  Not sure what I messed up on but probably didn't bake it long enough.

It's a lot easier just to throw a  sausage biscuit in the microwave or order a pizza."
"But now I want to see what I get at 1800 degrees.

Seriously though, I'm not that good a cook.  Most cooking takes way too much effort.  Not to mention the cleaning after."
"Nope. Well, kinda yes. It's base is micro USB2, but with extra pins for power *and* data. I mean, no different than the USB3 A plug. It's the standard USB2 4-pins + the extra power and data pins.

Don't worry about losing it. It's a standard cable, actually. A terrible interface, sure; but standard. You can replace them with and USB A to Micro USB 3.0 cable."
