It means he was using his position as board member to force another company into business with his pals company. 
"Potentially. If Paul said ""feel free to use the computers on the weekend to develop that website you've been talking about"" that's probably fine assuming any other stakeholders/partners agree. There can be tax implications for fringe benefits but that's for the accountants to sort out. 

This jerk's behaviour though is at least breach of contract and at its extreme could have been getting into extortion and embezzlement territory. "
Oh man I do lose the stealth sass of a good ol' copy-and-paste of last-email-they-probably-didn't-read-as-usual.

You know how many times I've had clients asking me to recreate Uber's interface in &lt; 1 week? I just sit there thinking about how long Uber spent on that design and iterations of it with a whole team of developers...
"Doesn't have ""knowledge base.""  I am a bit disappointed."
"Your story sounds almost exactly like the kind of stuff our former CEO used to pull before he got yeeted from his position last year. Give 100% discounts on our company's services to former business associates, spend ridiculous amounts of money on things we didn't need because he was buying them from companies his friends owned, stuff like that."
"I've come to realize people in companies can be insanely dumb. I've had company take overs where internally the CEO was back stabbed and the CFO got promoted to CEO. We're finishing building a 30m plant and the first thing he says ""Yeah we need to get this done faster, you guys aren't getting your promised bonuses after the plants done and we're probably going to let you go""

&amp;#x200B;

Or during a meeting this ass hat who the new CEO hired who was just a pure jack ass claimed that nobody used Allen Bradley PLCs to run plants and that people he's talked to has never heard of them. I seriously had to leave the room because I started laughing."
"In 1996 I was a construction worker working on a state prison in South Carolina. Near the end of the project the SC Dept of Corrections would take control of the various cell blocks as they were completed, moving furniture and supplies in.

They also started locking everything up at the end of the day. My friend and I had been working in a mechanical room fixing a motor on an air handler in the max security wing. It was late Friday afternoon, before a three day weekend and as we headed out of the building my friend jokingly wondered how much it would suck if SCDC had already left the facility.

Right as he said that I pushed on the door and ran face first into it, as it was locked up tight. We tried a few of the other doors but everything was locked. In a normal commercial building this wouldn't be a problem, we would have had roof access, we had tools, we could have busted down a door or broken a window. Not so much in a maximum security prison.

There were no smoke alarms accessible, or phones. Fire sprinklers would sound an alarm, and cause a boatload of damage as well, so that idea was out. 

No food, no toilet paper or cigarettes. We had water, and that s it. The only thing I cared about was the cigarette situation but my buddy had concert tickets and was pretty upset.

We managed to unhook a supply inlet duct from inside, and could scream for help through the heavy gate that covered the opening. Half an hour before the site closed we managed to attract someone's attention, but they told us the SCDC officers had already left for the long weekend.

I was begging for cigarettes to be pushed through the grate because if I had to spend three days and four nights listening to Wayne bitch the entire time about how much those concert tickets cost him, I was pretty sure I would end up in prison for real.

We were sitting on the floor of the mech room, our backs to the wall, contemplating our future while someone was off trying to get ahold of the Dept of Corr. I turned to Wayne, looked him dead in the eye and told him he was going to be my bitch. He made a weird gurgling sound and his eyes got big, but before he could say anything, the guy came back and said the cops were on the way and we would be out in an hour. The guy managed to get a cigarette through to me, which I smoked in the mech room while bolting the intake duct back to the wall, while Wayne was waiting nervously by the main entrance.

And that's how I got to be one of the first inmates at Kershaw Correctional Facility in South Carolina. Once in a while I'll tell stories about that job, and start with, ""back when I was in prison...""

 I love the startled looks I get. "
"im pretty after youve been insulted  using a derogatory term back, is acceptable, okay sparky?"
"It seems that the owner is being bought out for 25% of his shares. In that case, he's selling 25% of his shares to the investor, and it is 100% his money to take as an intrest-free loan."
Can you explain that one to me?

"It's not just a few things. Pretty much anything within Google's tools fails on multiple logins and will randomly toggle between them.

Pro Tip: Make different Chrome user profiles for each account. I'm a web developer and have about 10 Chrome profiles so I can log in and out of different user accounts. Latest client had 4 new Chrome profiles because I had different permissions on each one (Owner, Super Admin, App Admin, App User)."
Two weeks' notice? How about two minutes' notice? I guess you don't live in an at-will employment state.
Could just be that the investor is so arrogant they figured the escape clause would never kick in
Just make Siri for me plz no bill talk
"Oh, but I need this by the weekend! What do you mean you can't do it by then? What do I pay you for??!!"
Add a clause for damages and you may be able to hold onto some of the money...    
Worth a crosspost? :P
^^that's ^^the ^^joke
"I'd guess Mr. Investor can enter into his own agreement without the original owners as long as he's not claiming to represent the company. I mean, he's only a 25 percent shareholder."
The key thing there is all parties. Pretty sure that has to include the original owner here. 
it's normally present in all buildings.

"im saying this escape clause cant and doesnt exist , its not legal, you cant be stripped of your  money. its simply not possible, this isnt game of thrones where you just take away some lords lands. Even if he tries to use resources for something else. he wasnt successful, so the most that could happen is they dissolve the partnership and he gets his money back."
"There are a series of standard clauses put into damn near every contract (and laws themselves!) that say:

&gt;""If something in a section is illegal or unable to be enforced, only that section is voided. The rest of the contract is still enforced whenever possible.""

This is an issue lawyers have solved for decades."
He didn't buy the whole company he just purchased a minority interest (25%).

"So there's fail-safe, fail-secure and fail-dangerous. Failsafe is if the locks turn off when powered down. Fail-secure is if they get stuck on (IE need power to be unlocked)

Fail-dangerous is the least likely, since it's either a flaw or inherent, like a self sustaining nuclear reaction (although most control systems are failsafe, the control rods are usually lifted, instead of lowered, so if there's a power failure they fall down, into place, but the reaction itself is fail-dangerous)

Unless it's on a high security building, fail-safe is like 99% certain.

There's also mixed options, which I find interesting. Like those doors which, if no power is supplied, become one way doors (only openable from one side) so people can leave, but it's significantly harder for people to come in"
"im not a lawyer I am a paralegal who works  and has worked in law firms for years . I graduated as valedictorian and finished as a finalist int he national mock trial competition. 

you can pretend all you want, I have given no legal advice, but please, just stop making up shit as you go and then pretending in the  one who is wrong. Take a few classes in business law, go to work in contract law its boring as hell and is pretty boilerplate now anyway. 

Once you have done this, then come back and apologize. You need to grow up and stop pretending you know everything okay. Great, now go away. "
