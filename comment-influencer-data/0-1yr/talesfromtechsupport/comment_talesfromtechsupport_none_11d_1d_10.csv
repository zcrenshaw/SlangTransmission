"I really, really hope this was all in the report.

The competition deserves her."
"Not joking, some one a few weeks ago put in a service request through our ticketing system for a “door that was not closing properly”

100% true."
"I would reply to the last email, that had all the executives in it, with a PSA about ensuring everyone is plugging in their various electronic devices into proper electrical outlets to ensure no company time or money is lost on preventable accidents. Don’t mention her case at all, just say you want to “prevent any incidents going forward :)”"
"Wow, her boss needs to know how stupid she is.  She wasted a lot of money and time.  I would say, all of this waste should be deducted from her commission but we all know that won't happen."
"If this recently happened. You need to talk to your boss and go find the site supervisor of security and go over securities post orders. 

Either both of them are so fucking stupid 

I cant even finish this I am so angry."
"I know the pain. I started at my job about 18 months ago as a field tech. Travel to ~ 20 sites all between 10 minutes and 90 minutes from the mothership. Be first contact for any IT issues (cameras, security, network, devices). 

Then one teammate left so I went to 30 sites. Then the team leader left and I went to 40 (including out of state sites). At that point it was two techs handling mothership and 80 locations. 

Then they got a new manager in, and the dude has some serious issues fitting in with the corporate culture and can't wrap his mind around 90% of the tasks that are a part of daily business, so my teammate left and 16 years of knowledge went with him.

I'm currently job hunting because my need for benefits is now gone and I can't stand the new manager either. Plus the pay is pretty crap."
A co-worker of mine once got a call from a woman whose lunch was stolen from the fridge. How she could've thought that was remotely our responsibility baffles me.
"I don't think I would want anyone from that firm representing my case.  Unless of course, I *wanted* to lose."
"&gt;I am not a good person. I sent Ian.

I sense there is another story waiting to be told?"
"&gt;""Well, I recently helped a team of top executives plug in a USB cable...""

I think you misspelled ""Driving modern technology outcomes with C-level executives to enable critical business functions and time sensitive deliverables""."
"They're the only people they know that have figured out this ""troubleshooting and process of elimination"" thing"
"Agreed. I had one user who found it a impossible to write a program because whenever she tried it asked ""Are you sure you want to quit?"" And she thought""Week I thought I was but maybe the program knows something I don't"" and she would click No and be stuck."
"I don't know, but using nat to connect to a server in an entirely different network isn't just stupid. Its advanced stupid.

Tbh I didn't even think it was possible"
"This.  


This right here is why I am willing to stand outside for 8 hours at a time. 

Or repeatedly say the same thing over and over. 

Almost literally paint a target on my self for possible death or injury.  

Before I will ever ever go back to IT. 

( armed guard now.  I take no stress home with me each day) 

And I'm really sorry you had to go to Ohio."
"Our facilities department has no ticketing system, or if they do, it isn’t connected to ours. 

The only way you can reach them is via phone if it’s an emergency or via a voicemail if it’s non-urgent."
"Or has more static charge than usual
""Hey the door zapped me""
""IT touched it last, they must've gotten some magic lightning juju on it, must be their problem"""
"This happened this evening, after I drifted off to sleep.

Part of the reason I am so tired is I drove an hour (one way) to an offsite facility, all to plug a USB cable in to a printer. After seven interactions (entire management chain included) trying to get this user to understand WHAT USB is. Diagrams, photos, all of this.

I know that next week, my (only) coworker is going to return to work, and make a joke, something about ""How's that CISSP treating you?""  

Anyone in 1) Pittsburgh 2) Austin 3) Charlotte looking for a level 1 cybersecurity dude? I'm your guy. Most interested in Jr. Pentesting but I am not picky."
Send SM all of your password tickets. That's security related.
You can literally set their keyboard on fire and they will just let it burn while they proceed to call IT to fix the problem.
"I dont seem to remember Ian.  PFY?

Also if they didnt learn from the last time they threw away several thousand dollars, and are still being extra cheap, then fuck em."
Billable time?
"That's a difficult situation there. At 16 I was working in fast food and I had some people say some completely inappropriate things to me that were unprovoked and it would have been perfectly reasonable for me to respond like that. However, the girl in this situation fully deserves to be spoken to in that way but I'd not consider my parenting a success if they spoke to someone the way she did that led up to her saying he couldn't talk to her like that and just didn't use the phrase you pointed out.

P. S. Sorry for formatting and grammar, am on mobile."
No capes!
"Thumb, meet index finger."
"I won't immediately condemn her for not going to meet you halfway although that would have been nice and fair. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt in case she is a sole caregiver for a disabled person and must stay nearby, or her car works no better than her laptop because she doesn't know where to put gasoline, or any other unlikely but remotely possible excuse.

What I don't understand is why in heavens name would anyone be so obstinate as to not even consider the possibility that it is unlikely for there to be something wrong with that many laptops? Why would she refuse to even consider that just maybe she is doing something wrong? Ask a coworker in the next office, google the laptop manual on your phone and look at the pictures, offer a neighbor's kid twenty dollars as long as he promises not to tell anyone you know if it is something you are doing wrong, bring it to the local library and ask for help, something/anything. I have trouble believing that she had no local resources whatsoever who could look at it and tell her what was wrong."
"There's a 1/3 chance of that happening, so it's not impressive."
I think you should complain to management. 2 IT guys for 1000 endpoints is stupid. Your management doesnt understand IT.

"I'm curious: in situations like this, the company can't hire some local IT person to give the situation a once over before sending you all the way there and back?"
