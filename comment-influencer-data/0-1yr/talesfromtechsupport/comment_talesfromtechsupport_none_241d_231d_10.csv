"At least it WAS the modem.

The worst are folks who describe what they think the cause of the problem is ... as the problem ... and don't tell you what is actually failing.

Dude yapped at me forever recently about how a whole application was down.... but really he couldn't print.   Fuck that guy."

"I totally get the part about the missing change, that's natural (especially if you handle 350 costumers a day). But someone who doesn't understand the difference between ""should"" and ""is"" shouldn't be allowed to handle cash."
Display port adapters they purchase are usually crap. Cheapest ones they can find. 
"If only that user would've admitted what happend. 

Recovering a broken drive from a spilled drink is usually an easy and surprisingly affordable repair for a data recovery specialist or electronics guy. Could as cheap as 1 hour of work and the price for a replacement hard disk."
"the number of arguments Ive had with management and purchasing over this is astronomical.

If I tell you to buy -this- item, with -this- model number and -this- version, friggin BUY that version. I dont care if you can get it for half as much from a chinese knock off site, I dont care if amazon has a deal for a similar model, I specified that item -intentionally- because 1) it will work 2) it will keep working and 3) I've already gone around the houses a few times dealing with the knock offs and similar but not the same models.

One project ended up 10 grand in the hole because they saved 200 on buying cheaper parts, cheaper parts that caused systematic failures and component burn outs.  My aftermath report could be summed up as ""I fucking told you so""."
He is trying to do HIS JOB! And u/CantaloupeCamper was being no help with all his/her pointless questions instead of just FIXING THE PROBLEM.
"How long has she been working that she has never been over or under at least once? 

Paper money not properly flatten can easily get stuck inside the cash box, change can fall on the floor, she gave more or less than she should have perhaps due to a brain fart. There are so many ways there can be a difference, unless she is perfect, and she isn't. 

"
That's why I tend to ask them what they're trying to accomplish
"Yes.

That moment.

You might only get it two or three times in your IT career.

Close your eyes.

Enjoy it.

*Savor it.*

For it is the smug feeling of superiority."
Lol how long did you have that one in your back pocket? 
"When a user can't even hang up a phone correctly.

–\_–"
I once had a lady tell me that she had been in IT since before I was in diapers. She refused to do any trouble shooting. After about 15 minutes on the phone she finally agreed to trouble shoot. 30 seconds later it was working. From my experience if a user told you how qualified he was to troubleshoot he was wrong.
"""I need you to exit out of the application and start it up again""

*-turns monitor off and back on-*

""No I meant close the application""

*-minimizes it to the taskbar-*

""No you need to go to Menu -&gt; Exit and then start it up again, you just minimized it, it's still running""

*-goes to Menu -&gt; Print-*

""Jesus christ, just restart your computer, this is taking forever-*

*-goes to Start -&gt; Restart, [Application] is preventing Windows from shutting down. Caller lets it sit at that screen for 5 minutes, said they restarted it and ""now nothing"". What's happening? ""nothing"" is there a message? ""no it's just nothing, and a box that says 'Application is preventing Windows from shutting down', is that important?""-*

""Okay you know what? Just pull the power cord on the back and plug it back in ffs"""
"I’m guessing that she either was super new, or she’d never been over or under on the new system. The old system only allowed you to put in the cash by bills and coins (no lump sums) and wouldn’t tell them if they were over or short until they had it all entered in. The new system has several reports you can run at any time of day to see how much cash the system thinks is in the drawer. So she must have decided that the report trumped reality?"

"Please god no not again, why are you converting DP toVGA to HDMI your laptop has an HDMI our just plug the cable in... yes that will fix the sound issue as well... 

I hate our old conference room..."
I'm curious wtf was that guy's plan?!  Shoot everyone over the retrieval of this PC and then scamper off into the shadows with the data like some kind of IT Hamburglar?  
"I hate when people on the phone won't listen thoug. I had people working on my roof at the beginning of last year. One of them tripped with the optic cable and tore it.

I called the ISP telling them that some animal (never specified the animal was a human being) tripped with my cable, that I literally had end A and end B in my hands.

Dumb tech was ""ok, can we turn on and off your router""    
I was like ""I understand the procedure, but listen to me, I have the torn wire on my hands...""

""Ok sir, now we need you to reset your router by completely unplugging it and wait half a minute""     
....""Nothing's changed I literally have a torn wire I need a tech to come over and repair it""

""Alright, now please could you tell me if it's just one device or all devices lost internet""    
""Please nothing connected to this modem has internet because the wire is ripped off the one that comes from the street""

""Could you please tell me if any device is running Windows Vista""       
I gave up I yelled at him, I'm not proud but person was definitely following a script and was unable to be reasoned with, a monkey would have been easier."
"Yeah, I'm notorious for being 5¢ over.

Apparently there's some mental math that I've decided is wrong and my way is better.

It only happens when we're super busy.

But it's always 5¢ over."
"Here's my story as a user.

One day randomly, my internet started going to shit. Did the usual stuff, reboots, firmware updates, etc. No dice.

Called customer service, we go thru basic steps. They suggest it could be the modem itself. I say unlikely, let's check the physical stuff first. CS says if they find nothing wrong on their end, it will cost me. I agree.

My logic is, I have an old house in an old neighborhood, the infrastructure is not new to the area. Infrastructure is probably due for repairs.

Tech comes out, finds the neighborhood junction box is wrecked, spends a few hours working in it. Junction box is good now. I thank him. No money spent on my end. Unfortunately, Internet is crap still.

A few days later, more techs come out and actually replace the underground cabling due to some damage they found (not related to the junction box mind you). They also clean up my house's connection box. I thank them. No money spent on my end for a second time.

Internet is still crap.

I grumble and shell out for a new modem on Newegg.

Internet is great now.

On the bright side, at least they fixed my cabling and junction box. They needed to be fixed anyway."
"This.

I do field service for a few POS companies.

One time, I went out to swap out a defective cash drawer.

As par for the course, to make sure it's clear, especially since the problem was that it would not open or close without a screwdriver (to help pry it open, even with the key!), I took the bottom off the old cash drawer.

And pulled six, $20 bills out of the latch.

"I am routinely amazed at how certain people are still employed with such a lack of common sense and technical savvy. 

I can understand that behavior when windows 95 first came out. After 2005, people working in an office environment should be required to have a basic level of tech competency to retain their employment."
I work in tradeshows and conventions and see this all the time. Actually had a client complain that he couldnt get his equipment running because his boss bought the $5 cord in stead of the $20. (I believe it was also a usb2 instead of 3 but it was many long shifts ago)
Don't trust the Internet stored thing but assume his profile on an Internet server. 🥴
I’m pretty sure that’s the only time it’s happened. Maybe some day it’ll happen again before I retire. 
Or you are sent a box of DP to VGA adapters. 
"Or a genius at setting expectations. The next time he comes in the work late, his excuse will be that his tire pressure was low, so he rebuilt the engine. And nobody will know whether to believe it. "
It's even possible that they spilled OJ on a laptop and the drive is fine it just needs removing...
He was probably banking on people freaking out / being compliant when having a gun pointed at them.  
"I don't... What did she want to happen? I don't understand. She wanted you to fix the reality of what was in her drawer? What was the goal? Did she want the report to show $826.40? 

I'm so confused."
"""Behold, this new great standard! Send your high resolution crystal clear to the...""  
""Yeah, well, I'm gonna use an adapter to turn it into VGA, thank you.""

"It doesn't even have anything to do really with the NIC. It's included in the gigabit ethernet over copper standard (IEEE 802.3ab) so all devices (like routers, switches etc) have it."
He's going places. Like the janitorial department.
"I usually start with: I have already tried x, y and z, however I'd be happy to run through them again in required ...   


We can all be idiots at times, and miss something .. and often the guys on the end of the phone have a check list .. it's also easier to restart the modem / pc at the start of the call over spending hours  trouble shooting only to have a restart fix it later.

"Not surprised. There are so many ""USB-C"" cables that are just the shape and only ok for charging. 

Partially the fault of USB-C spec having a few different standards for shape and capability but makes everything more confusing where prior to -c and 3 a usb cable was a usb cable and the only variable was power only or power and data. 

Granted I think it's worth it for a reversible universal plug... "
"If you didn't touch it and it's only a few months old, how did the cable magically break? Just reboot the damn router."
"I was told ""they know how to do their job, not a computer""

"I think this is a standard IT support call.

"We had a church as a client. The people were nice but usually older and volunteer. We lost remote access to a PC while doing some QB installations for the finance person, who was out that day. We asked the receptionist to reboot the computer.  I wasn’t on the call but I could hear it going on in the other room. 

My guy: “ Hey Cindy, yea if you could just run into Linda’s office and reboot her computer real quick I’d appreciate it.  It would save me an hour drive and I want to get QB working before she comes back.”

Cindy: “Oh I don’t know about that.”

Us: “ You won’t have to log in and won’t have access to any of her files. You can just hold the power button and then turn it back on.”

Cindy: “Hold the power button?”

Us: “Yea. It’s on the top left of the computer I believe. Just hold it in, count to 10, wait a minute and then hit it once to turn it back on.  It’s called a hard reboot.”

Cindy: “Oh, ok, I’ll try. I’m going to put the phone down.”

I hear my employee mute the phone and then say out loud “What’s there to try?”

Cindy: “Hey, I’m back. I couldn’t do it.”

What do you mean you couldn’t do it? Like you were afraid? Confused. This isn’t hard?

Us: “Hey Cindy. What do you mean like it didn’t work?”

Cindy: “It was too complicated I couldn’t figure it out.”

Us: “Did you find the power button?”

Cindy: “I think so but it didn’t do anything when I pressed it. The other button popped out the cup holder.”

I’m kidding she didn’t actually say cup holder. She said “little tray”.

Us: “Ok well that was definitely it there’s only two buttons on the computer. What happened when you held it? How long did you hold it for?”

Cindy: “Wait I had to hold it? For how long?”

Us: “Yes, like a 10 count should do it.”

Cindy: “I can’t do this it’s too difficult. I’m not good with computers. Can you just drive out. I’ll pay for it myself.”

We drove out. Held the power button. Showed her how in case she ever worked up the courage to do it herself in the future.  Installed QB from on site just to make sure it was done. 45 minute drive each direction to hold a power button. "
"Oh my god, I've had the same exact call plus many others caused by cashiers not being able to do basic math. So we just started telling them that this is not a technical issue and that they should just ask their manager. "
Or you use higher end PCs because they still come with a VGA connector but they change the model part way through rollout and drop the connector. 
"Most likely yeah, but it is tiring that you explicitly tell them I have two pieces of the same cable and they are not attached together and they ask you if you run windows vista"
