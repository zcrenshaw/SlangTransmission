"""I don't read you files or email. You're not that interesting."""
"&gt; ""This is why women can't make it in your little IT universe.""

I was going to compare her to the guy from Monty Python and the Holy Grail yelling ""Help! Help! I'm being oppressed!"" and then I read this. 

Really? Really?

I wish you could tell her that a female software developer saw this and would like to inform her that the reason she can't make it in IT has nothing to do with her sex and everything to do with the fact that she's an idiot."
"""I don't think about you at all.""  --Don Draper"
"I was gonna say ""you'd think expensive computers would have safeguards against shitty cables"" then I realised turning off *was* the safeguard and that I'm an idiot"
On the bright side he now has a PCI compliant POS.
"Her 4 year old is missing and she still has the time to piss off some tech guys because she desperately wants to watch TV now?

If my 4 year old was missing, i wouldn't even THINK of watching TV. He could get killed out there during every minute that i wouldn't find him.

She is a shitty mom. 

I really hope she just made that up to make you guys feel bad. "
I don’t think fridges are very nice to wireless signals...
Yeah this is crazy because ou head of IT is... a woman. 
"“Can’t hurt.”

Hah. Never call back acting for *more* money unless you absolutely can’t avoid it. 

You call back with a discount or to offer more service - this way they do not always associate your calls with spending more money. "
"Sort of feel that as a blackhat you should make it a habit to record all calls and forward all questionable emails and contact legal
 authorities/lawyers at the first sign of anything strange going on. Shitweasel was obviously trying to commit large-scale theft and should've hung for it (metaphorically). CYA."
"Even my union lawyers have been impressed on multiple times with the quality and detail of my CYA, I generally use my knowledge of forensics to make sure what I have will stand up in court  with no issues :)

In the Finnish sense, it's fair to say I ""take excellent notes""."
Sometimes its screw the time limit. Let's get this solved. 
"&gt;I'm not IT trained like you

Time to institute mandatory role based training including IA cybersecurty foundations. Anyone who touches a computer needs an appropriate level of training. You could include an option to skip the ""Basic Computer Operation"" portion if a user attests that they know how to perform a set of those functions so you don't make the non-difficult users' lives needlessly tedious.

In this lady's instance the moment that she says she doesn't have those skills you refer her for mandatory retraining."
"For you the day that the IT Guy graced your office was the most important day of your life, but for me it was another Tuesday."
Yep!  I wanted to get paid on time!
"Well, they did't get a tantrum  because that was too simple a solution so you've some luck left."
"I am currently watching Babylon 5, and though about this Mimbari quote:

""understanding is not required, only obedience""

Edit: I have corrected the spelling, and I have also been informed that this is a quote originally from the Vorlons."
"Had a disabled user with a spanking brand new wheelchair computer (think Stephen Hawking style).

Said computer didn't want to power on at all. Not my job really, but sure, I'll check it out so the user doesn't have to wait a couple of days for the wheel chair computer repair company to come over.

Somehow noticed that one of the USB ports was shorted,  probably someone forcibly trying to insert some USB device the wrong way around.

A small screwdriver and some unbent pins - it powers up and boots successfully. 10 years later, it's still the most grateful user I've had. I'll never forget that smile."
"""Sir, this is an added expense of two labor hours and will be billed accordingly.""

They might not understand technology, but you better believe they know what a dollar sign means."
Oh yeah they were doing credit cards on a separate card reader connected to a phone line.  But now they do it with a  modern POS (and they have a service contract so they don't call me about it. So it all worked out.) 
"and it all started with someone forgetting a password?
"
"&gt; ""SO YOU ARE READING MY CONFIDENTIAL FILES, AREN'T YOU?""

Wishing for the ability to respond with:

Only when law enforcement and HR came to me last year, but I wouldn't worry about that.  They said it probably wouldn't involve charges being filed."
"Amazing. 
"
"To paraphrase something from BOFH, insisting on the confidentiality of your files makes me look through your files to see what you want so badly to be confidential"
The ceo will tell the CIO to stop being so uptight and to tell people no after 8PM local time. All support stops at 8 PM. This is not the first time he has bent other people over backwards to help a vip outside of scope. 
Hold on typical IT not rolling out desktops to run on magic.
"Point Of Sale, not Piece Of Sh*t. Got it.

EDIT: Y'all are very redundant."
"I'm impressed at how well armored your ass was throughout the entire story. Getting out of that situation with as little damage as you did is a testament to either incredible luck, incredible skill, or both."
"This is what happens when bureaucratic BS is prioritized over more important stuff. Very sad, but amazing at the same time."
"A bit ruder, the literal translation is ""go ski into a c*nt"".  As to %money%, it had over 1k companies using it throughout mainly the nordics."
"There are some old ""sales rules"" that are floating around that people think can be used in any type of sale.

An example would be "" no 3 times "" rule where the person has to say no three times before you take no for an answer.

Not taking someone's no for an answer is just rude most of the time.  You can't just keep asking the same question three times. 

I remember once driving into a speciality car wash. Their cheap wash was $5, but they had one for $25 That did more.  I thought  what the heck, I'll  do the $25.

When I get up in line, the guy offers a $ 80 service. Detailed the inside of your car, etc.   I didn't want to spend $80.  My car was older, and not a source of pride.  No amount of detailing is going to mend the worn spots in the upholstery.

I smile and tell him "" no thank you.""  I didn't have a chance to tell him what I did want, because he starts talking immediately again.  He acts like I didn't just tell him ""no"", and starts in again for the $ 80.  

""No."" I said.  I didn't smile this time.

He sighs, looks visually  anxious, and starts yet again on the $80.

It was as if he was not going to sell me anything other than the $80 service.  I know that not the case, but it sure felt that way.

I tell him: "" I'm not going to spend $80 on cleaning my car.  Let me out of line, I'm leaving.""

I was pissed, got out of line, and never went back to the business.  I had frequented them numerous times before.

While I drove out of line and  left, I looked in my rearview mirror.  The man looked tired, worn out and defeated.

I can only imagine his boss told him he had to the 3 no rule, and was getting angry customers all day.

They went out of business a year later. I don't know if it was due to them pissing off customers, or their desperation to sell the service was a sign of their spiral downward that was already in progress.

Fixing your personal laptop from home? Not my problem. Fixing someones wheelchair that significantly improves someones quality of life? I'd say yes to that one any day. 
"I literally just hit refresh to see if you had posted the finale yet!

Edit: Just finished. I was almost expecting it to end with an announcer's table. Well done!"
Glad not to have to deal with people like this... It'll be interesting to know how this plays out!
"The art of covering my a$$ is something that I learned in school.  One of the senior professors in my educational program thought it a vital skill to instill on everyone, and it is one of the more important and useful things I took away (though I didn't think it would matter as much beyond making sure my evidence would hold up in court, he taught me forensics!)"
"She didn't even want to watch TV or she would not have objected to him coming by immediately, sent him home when he was almost at her house and then flat out lied yet again after already receiving several hundred bucks in credit.

This is a woman who knows the cable company fucked up and is taking it every bit of the way to make it as difficult as possible to fix in order to drag out more future rebates. (That's my theory, anyway.)"
"So...suksi vittuun essentially means go fuck yourself?

Bro that was......epic.

What an absolute shitstorm. How widely in use is/was %money% ?"
Unrelated: My electrical bills have been sky high since I started service with you guys. I think your modem is using it all!
"So much this.

If it's a grandparent type person who isn't yelling at you, has it ever not been worth it to stay on the line till it's solved?"
Is her name Jenn?
"&gt; ""This is why women can't make it in your little IT universe.""

Uh, I'm pretty sure they can, if they actually take the time to learn and don't yell at the person teaching them."
"Believe it or not, that is LEGAL in Finland, only using those without authorization would be illegal!"
"I wouldn't go so far as idiot. If you hadn't posted the retraction, the world would have never known about your brain fart."
Sounds like the kid is imaginary or was taken by social services and she is having some kind of mental/drug issues.
"""how *dare* you make me feel stupid for not reading stuff"""
"This may not work on doctors. If they work in a hospital then they often don't see the admin expenses and just expect the hospital to deal with it. The hospital could potentially chew them out, but most likely it is being looked at by an underpaid and undertrained secretary working in a windowless basement who could not care less and wouldn't be paid any more even if he/she did her job well."
"This may indeed be my life, and while this all was stressful as hell when it was going on, it was almost worse after.  Three years after this I encountered one of the other guys in the infosec field in Finland with connections to Agency1, and he outright said ""I know you. You should have done what Agency1 told you to do, then maybe you'd be able to get a job! How does it feel to be unemployed?"" (and no, he wasn't being concerned/friendly, more laughing in my face) He was then surprised to learn that I actually was employed (at the time) as he was expecting the black mark done by the agencies involved and others as part of the fallout from all of this to have kept me unemployed for years."

"&gt;  You could include an option to skip the ""Basic Computer Operation"" portion if a user attests that they know how to perform a set of those functions so you don't make the non-difficult users' lives needlessly tedious.

Nope, not without passing a basic competency test. Assume **NOTHING** where Lusers are involved."
