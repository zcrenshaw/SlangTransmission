"&gt; Nurse: ""Oh, if I push the X, it says, 'Do you want to save this report or discard it?'. It won't let me close the program until I click something, and I don't know what to push, so I turn the computer off.""

&gt; Me: Maam, you're a nurse, correct?

&gt; Nurse: Yes.

&gt; Me: Did you ever, even while in school, have a patient where you weren't sure what you should do next?

&gt; Nurse: Of course!

&gt; Me: Did you ever just shoot them? Shoot them right in the face?"
"""I've tried absolutely nothing, and I'm all out of ideas"""
"My condolences friend, I have similar issues as well, but with people that think that every IM app is WhatsApp. I.E. 
Idiot: ""Hey I sent you a WhatsApp msg and you didn't reply""
Me: ""But I don't even have your phone number""
Idiot: ""Which phone number dummy? Through Facebook""
Me: -Hiperventilates-"
"Why is it that when an electronic device is involved people just forget how to read? It comes up so often it's insane.

I recently had to teach someone how to use a smart phone. It went kind of like this:

&gt;Her: So what do I press if I want to make a phone call?

&gt;Me: How... how about the one named ""Phone""?

&gt;Her: Oh, I see. Wow this is so difficult.

&gt;Me: Is it? Is it really? FFS..."
"Admin help! I turned on the computer like you said, but now I can't find all my open unsaved documents!"
"&gt;He battled cancer for years before I met him, and it finally took his life a few years after this happened, but I'll always remember him because of stuff like this he did for others without a second thought.

I expected one of those ""and he banged her, lol"" tales and then you pull this and now I'm shedding a tear for Steve.

Here's to you man, wherever you are. Cheers."
Run. Fast. And CYA to the wazoo.
"Had a girl the other day do that. She had all this unsaved data on a spreadsheet she'd been working on for a few days straight and someone in her area told her that we typically ask them to ""turn it off and on again"" and that solves most problems (which is what she put in an email to the help desk). So she does that... but doesn't save. So she submits a ticket and I call and ask how I can help. She tells me all the work she had is gone because she shut down her computer ""like we told her to do."" I asked who told her and she said ""Well, the help desk.""

We did? ""Which one of us told you that?""

""You.""

""I didn't tell you to do that. You told me you did that before I called you.""

She gets upset and wants to me to return all her unsaved data back to the spreadsheet or she's going to talk to her manager. That's fine Karen (yeah, her name really was Karen). So while I'm looking to see if I can pull an auto backup out of Excel's ass for her, she proceeds to tell her manager that I forced her to shut down her computer. He gets on the phone and asks me why I did that and I told him that I can pull the logs from her computer, the logs from when she sent the email in for the ticket and the log time from when I called and prove to him that I did nothing of the sort.

So now Monday I have to go to HR with said logs because she got written up for lying to her supervisor and she's trying to fight and say that I forced her to shut down her computer and lose her work. Can't wait to watch Karen get fired."
"Dammit, my guess was caps lock.
Don't remember, but does rebooting reset the keyboard status?"
"My favorite all time favorite encounter is when I had an older gentlemen stop in and say his mouse wasn’t working for his keyboard. Turns out he was actually picking the mouse up, and essentially trying to use the screen as a giant mousepad. Your story is definitely a close second."
"People, what a bunch of bastards.

Except for Stacy, she seems cool"
The real wtf is that bandwidth limit.
"Apprentices getting yelled at for no reason?

Sounds about right xD"
"Good tech Steve, the patron saint of ""Did you try turning it off and on again?"""
You might not want to know the answer to that question.
"I've been a phone repair tech for 3 years, 99% of the time its just lint that gets packed in the port"
"EXACTLY. I just had another call similar but with a desktop not turning on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moved desk, PC now not turning on.

Is it plugged in - ""yes""

Powered on at the wall - ""yes""

extension or mains - ""mains, defo switched on""

unplug and plug back into pc - ""already done, no point doing that again""

unplug and hold down power button for 10 seconds - ""ugh fine""...""it works!"""
"""Before I begin is do you have any unsaved work on your PC? I want to make sure you don't lose any work from Today"" that line has saved my but so many times. If I have to make a change that could have a possibility of a reboot or crash I make them save."
"One time I saw an elderly Scottish gentleman pick up the mouse and talk to it, expecting the computer to be voice activated."
"""yeah, I have a few spread sheets open with all the company data from the last quarter. Um, this only copy of my manager's expansion project for the next few years.  I went ahead and shut down the computer, should I have saved that stuff before I shut off the computer?  Oh it said it was autosaving those, with a message about not unplugging the computer. I didn't know what that meant, so I unplugged it. """
"It happens more often than not in my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

""But my computer wasn't working just a minute ago, it must be afraid of you computer people \[customer laughs at their attempted joke\]."""
"[Learned helplessness.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)

People have learned that devices are so complex that they cannot understand them. They don't try anymore, they just take it as a given that they cannot understand.

They see words, they may even know what the words mean, but to them it's a secret code like ""The crow flies at midnight."" The super complex device requires knowledge they don't have, so they don't even bother to parse the words. They've been bit before by hearing ""The crow flies at midnight"" and having it have nothing to do with crows at nighttime.

To some people, the effort to make devices more use friendly and intuitive will always fail because they are already convinced that the device is too complex for them."
"Ah, printers. I swear they are powered by pixies on a pedal bike. They only do what you want if they feel like it."
They never saw it coming!
"You've trained your users that they can bypass the system.

There's an easy fix for this:

Don't work on anything that isn't in a ticket.

If they email you, forward it to the help desk.

If they call your phone, ask them for the ticket for the ticket #. If they don't have it, refer them to the help desk.

If they approach your desk directly, ask for the ticket #. If they don't have it, refer them to help desk.

If they stop you in the hall, tell them you don't have time and refer them to the help desk (unless it's actually regarding a ticket you're working on.)"
"My wife and I are one year apart only. She often comes to me:

\-Darling, there's a message on the phone.

\-What does it says?

\-""Do you want to activate n function?""

\-Well, do you?

\-No.

\-Then, why you ask me?

\-Just in case it's something important.

\-But it says right there what it is about.

\-Fine, don't help me.

\-*Internal screaming.*

And you bet your ass she's coming to ask me next time."
The human brain might be as complex as the whole universe... though sometimes it just bugs out like a Dlink switch
"If it helps I don’t think I can actually be fired for that. My actual boss is much more understanding than my supervisor, who is training me for just three more weeks then he’s gone for good."
"You have no idea how funny that comment is. You see, I don't drink, because I despite the taste of alcohol, and beer, in particular, is one of the most vile taste in the world. I would - literally - rather drink used motor oil.

So when you say I've earned a beer, well, how else could a week like that end?"
"&gt;People, what a bunch of bastards.

That is my ALL TIME favorite Roy quote. Especially in his OIRISH accent.

MAN I love that show.

And yeah, Stacy was a champ."
"Have you tried turning it off, and going home and never coming back?"
It sure does.
"No joke. The dude was a seriously good guy. The rest of us kept talking about that phone call he got for a couple days after. He never brought it up because, honestly, he was just happy he could help.

Patron Saint, indeed."
"The only one I personally run into is my mother can't tell the difference between iMessage and texting (As in SMS). Fortunately we're an all-iPhone/iPad household. She can tell FB Messanger, Skype, etc. just fine.

EDIT: Just thought to add, if iOS 13 goes as far as WWDC said it would with iMessage though, things could start to get interesting anyway."
"Depends on how much stink the person complaining creates. IT is always the weakest link, especially a new hire.

And your supervisor's attitude speaks volumes about the work environment of that place. CYA will be needed, in droves, and Karens and their male counterparts will be plenty."
Clearly you don't know what you're talking about. My pickup truck doesn't have back seats.
Ooh I want to hear the rest of this story! It probably deserves its own post when you’re done.
"&gt; ""I see.. So you are telling me I need to login in order to open my company car in future"" 

Don't tempt me."
"If pressured, I like smiling, following the user to their desk, sitting down at their workstation, opening the New Ticket ui, and asking them to dictate the problem while I transcribe it for them. Then submitting, standing up, and walking away.

I don't think that it's ever happened twice for the same user."
