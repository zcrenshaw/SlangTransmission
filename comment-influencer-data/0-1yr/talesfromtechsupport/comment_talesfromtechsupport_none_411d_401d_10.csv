"Honestly thought I'd be packing my shit when I went upstairs.

In my book it was an unforgivable mistake.

I really believe that the thing that saved me was that I went up with not one problem, but something closer to six, all completely avoidable if things were done properly.

I essentially still got away with blaming the guy before me, mainly because by this point his reputation for cowboying was the stuff of legend."
"I actually got contracted to deal with a similar aftermath to this.

Picture this:  Small optician's office, previously cheaped out on network cabling.  Inefficient application that doesn't play nice with anything less than gigabit.  2 ports routinely cabled with 1 wire (which you can do if you're prepared to forego gigabit speeds).

I had a proper networking contractor come in and quote for re-doing the lot with 2 ports per desk with fully certified Cat6.  It was pretty obvious with even a cursory glance that precisely nothing was worth trying to salvage.

My client didn't bat an eye.  Nobody pretended it was a cheap job (it wasn't; it was very expensive) but that the whole point of the work was to ensure they wouldn't have to do it again.  I can only imagine what a nightmare trying to get anything done was before we fixed it up."

"Also, the grammar sounds a lot like a Chinese speaker - they don't use all of the same connecting words English does, so people with Chinese as their first language who learn English often omit them in practice, especially if they're not great at the language.

"I work in a retail store that handles a lot of computer repairs (where I do most of my work) and have plenty of entitled customers come in, by far my favourite was the customer asking for a copy of the data back up (hard drive replacement) of their 20 year old daughter's laptop. Keep in mind this was after the daughter dropped it off and paid for the service"
"My wife does photography as a hobby/side gig. Doesn't charge much and not nearly enough to replace her current income. Just something she enjoys and basically charges for her time being out there taking pics. She drives to whatever location they choose, doesn't make you purchase pictures, gives a full copyright release with all pics on DVD and does all the editing. It just takes about a week or two to get it all done b/c career and life come before hobby that isn't paying any bills.

With that said, someone wanted her to do some business photos with their employees that they could use for advertisement. My wife said she would do it for $50 for up to 4 people, $25 per person after that plus compensation for them taking up an entire Saturday at a local park.

There were 18 people, all would be in costume and some would require costume changes. They wanted 4 - 5 poses per person and a few poses of all of them together.  That's $400 and my wife waived the time limit (for what was essentially a giant wedding party) as a friendly gesture for a family friend starting a business. 

Everything was booked and ready to go. That is, until the Friday before when said person calls and asks if my wife can lower the price to $100 for all 18 people. My wife said yes, but she would only be staying for 1 - 1.5 hours for that price. A couple of poses per person and a couple of group poses is doable in that amount of time. Or, if money was an issue, it could be broken up over a few weekends so that it wasn't so much of a hit to the wallet all at once. Neither were good enough. They wanted the agree upon poses and unlimited time for the not agreed upon price. My wife shut it down right then. They found someone to do it for cheaper than that, and it shows.

The funny part of all of this is, they have a thing on their site that says ""Hiring a &lt;insert thing here&gt;?"" Then it goes on to list what you think you are paying for (this one thing) vs what you are actually paying for (this long list of things that goes into making that one thing including time, talent, experience, etc.), which is understandable and reasonable. Then it mentions why asking for a massive discount, more time for free or just free in general is a bad idea and unfair.

I'm sure the same thing happens to all of us here in TFTS. *""Hey, can you come set up my new computer, home network, Alexa, cellular hotspot, and 15 devices?

"My favorite ""don't you know who I am"" story was told to me by a guy I used to work with at a relatively small oilfield service company, maybe 200 employees.  The guys sister married one of the owners of the company, who obviously had lots of money and some status in the tiny town of 5,000 people where the company was based.  She went on a weekend get away to the ""big city"" and tried to get her hair done at some fancy salon.  The salon was, obviously, booked solid with a wait list of a couple weeks.  She got all pissy and tried the ""don't you know who I am, my husband owns ABC Oilfield Services."" They had never even heard of the company and laughed her out of the shop."
