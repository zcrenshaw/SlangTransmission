"&gt;Anyway what Ginger wants is when you simply view the Case, the ownership of the Case is automatically switched to you.

The manager should be fired. This is not an acceptable process. What if, god forbid, you just wanted to view said Case to view details about it? Oh, so how it's assigned to you? How would you assign it back??

So dumb.."

"A few months prior:

C: I'd like to buy a phone case please.

Worker: Sure, which model phone?

C: iPhone 6s.

W: Okay, these 4 cases are a perfect fit.

C: Nah, I want this cheaper one.

W: That one won't fit properly; it'll cover the ringer sw-

C: I'M NOT STUPID, I KNOW YOU JUST WANT TO SELL ME A MORE EXPENSIVE ONE!

W: ... That'll be $19.95 sir."

"Error:  Corporation has encountered a redundancy.  Legacy user no longer supported, employment terminated."
"Often, when a company is acquired, the previous owner is retained for x amount of time as part of the purchase contract due to their institutional knowledge.  It also makes it easier to retain clients/customers and it prevents the previous owner from immediately starting a competing business.  

When x amount of time is up, the previous owners are often unceremoniously ‘retired’."

"I always love the phrase ""With all dude respect"", because it basically means ""At this moment, I have NO respect for you, but since I've uttered the magic phrase, I can now say what I want short of outright insulting you.""

"Never done that myself, but a previous HR guy printed a bunch of very, very sensitive documents to the wrong printer in another state.  Instead of calling someone there, he panicked and called me.  There was nothing I could do, it was gone already.    

He actually complained about it and I was requested to come up with a 'Fool proof way of preventing this from happening again'.  Yeah, right.  Keep stupid users from picking the wrong printer.  My boss fielded the complaint and eventually got them to back off."
"An email you shouldn't send:

&amp;#x200B;

Hey Ginger, here's a quick cost-benefit analysis I worked up.

Switching:

Cost: 1 Million Dollars

Timeline: 1-2 years

Business Impact: High

Notes: Massive overhaul to all business systems and processes. Massive user retraining. Additional delays likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Firing Ginger:

Cost: Free

Timeline: Immediate

Business Impact: Minimal

Notes: Few likely to notice. Possible net benefit in productivity."
You know how you fix that? Auto assignment of Cases. Takes about 10 hours of dev work.
Sounds like your chance to escalate this incident right up the vendor rep's alimentary canal and send him on his way to other opportunities.
"I had this *exact* same thing happen about five or six years ago. I got a call from the receptionist telling me that her PC was ""making mechanical noises"" then shut down and wouldn't start up again. I figured a failed CPU fan, no biggie. I get to her desk and can smell melted plastic. I get under her desk and discover one of those little space heaters. It was set at the back corner of the foot area, pointed up. Her PC was mounted under the desk and was getting the full blast of the heater from a distance of maybe 18"". The whole top of the case melted off and was sagging between the mounting rails. After I extracted the PC I found the CPU and GPU fans were both warped. All of the components actually survived but I had to give her a new PC anyway because of the case.

It took nearly a week for Human Resources to approve a memo telling people that space heaters were not permitted in the company. We told people to take them home by EOD on Friday or else they'd be collected. Early Monday morning we went around with a cart and removed *19* space heaters from under people's desks."
"&gt;User: If it doesn’t work, I’ll let your manager know. 

\*Oh, yes. By all means. I can certainly tell that you're a very important and busy person who needs things done as quickly as possible. Why don't we just do away with all this middleman nonsense and I'll just conference both your manager and mine into this call so you can hash out any more poorly-veiled threats you would like to mention with them. Does that work for you?

"Don't you need to restore documents from trash before using them? Sounds quite troublesome...

Or did that person always have the current documents on the desktop and used the trash as an archive?"
"Often, too, the old ownership is kept on with so-called ""golden handcuff"" deals, such that the the buyout, or some portion of it, isn't paid until they've worked through some transitional period.

If the buyout isn't intended to be a ""and now you retire"" kind of buyout, then old owner-employees typically don't vest in their new shares for some X number of months -- 18, 38, 60, etc. -- to keep them from leaving."
"I think corporate is right about not doing PC backups. Folder redirection for on-prem users and cloud storage for user-relevant folders (via OneDrive or similar) for remote users has been both more reliable and more useful, in my experience."

"&gt; Anyway what Ginger wants is when you simply view the Case, the ownership of the Case is automatically switched to you.

We have our entire company running on the Salesforce platform. This means departments which are not even related, but customers may reach one of us through the IVR. 

If you pull up their number, or case number, name etc and you read a case just to see what they might be calling about AND it switches  the case ownership to you? This is an impending disaster."
"I can fix this.

Automate the trash cleanup so it gets done once a week.

A lot of people are gonna get burned that first week.

The people that get burned the second week?  Give them there walking papers, you don't need them."

"Keep in mind this isnt always the case. I've worked for a company where the owners were awesome people, sold the company to another, gave a mega bonus from the proceeds of said sale to current employees and then stayed on for quite a while afterwards running the company semi-autonomously.

If they are a dbag before sale, they are going to be a dbag post sale. If they are awesome pre-sale, may still be awesome post sale."

"Nice info, the reviewer is not as creative as I thought."
"I had a similar t-shirt situation many years ago (probably over a decade now come to think of it).

I was the sole resident IT support guy at a smallish company that did database development work.

I was the guy that ran the network and *built* the servers and did all of the desktop support.  literally anything that was development work, I did it.

I had a ""Don't blame me, it's a software problem"", one of my best mates worked in the Dev department, he had the matching ""Don't blame me, it's a hardware problem"".

Guess which of us got told that their shirt was ""inappropriate"".  Yep, that's right, the one hardware guy in the place.  Fine for the dev guy to wear his (though being a good friend o mine, he din;t bother after I was told not to wear mine any more).

Then again, being the sole IT guy, I was put under the Dev department for management purposes.  This kept having issues, such as the time that the complaint came to me ""your servers are shit, every time you build a newer faster one, our application runs slower and slower"".

I got them to make me a test app, as it was to do with disk write speeds, did a full testing regime, documented the issue, came up with a solution (this actually caused a 1500% speed increase!!), plus got a new version of the test program made which proved my solution, documented this with a 20 page report with all my findings and submitted it.

I then got hauled into a disciplinary meeting because apparently is was ""disrespectful"" of me by suggesting that it was actually their lazy coding that caused the issue (it was), and I was ""sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong"" by suggesting a simple change to their code which fixed the issue (it was literally one line of code because 4 lines)."
