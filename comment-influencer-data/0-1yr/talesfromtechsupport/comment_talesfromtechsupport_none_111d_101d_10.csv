" Subject: Fire. 

Dear Sir/Madam, I am  writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of  123 Cavendon Road... no, that's too formal......                                                             :                                                                               

 Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark.  Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to  hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss."""
"&gt; I wish I could understand what the point was that he was trying to make.

""Give me the $200 rollers for free"""
"Email uses the internet? I thought it was like the phones or something, which those are down too...

&amp;#x200B;

You know this stuff right? Can't you make it work for the time being?"
"I facepalmed hard reading it, then I read your facepalm, lol.

Jesuschrist, why it is **so damn hard** to make them understand certain things?"
At least she didn’t ask you to send a new monitor over wifi.
PC LOAD TUNES
"&gt;The customers staff are pestering me for the status every few minutes.

Fuck I hate that. It's just going to take longer if you keep interrupting me.

I work on phone systems and one time I had this sysadmin hanging over my shoulder asking me if he could help. 

I said. ""Yeah, go out to the back of the warehouse, farthest from this office and listen for a page. Come tell me when you hear it, but stay there until you do.

I finally finished up and left and left him standing out in the back of the warehouse."
"Can anyone tell me why people ""save"" things to the recycling bin? 



I've heard of this several times and I can't figure it out."

Oh, gawd. I think I just got a chubbie. Where can I find a company with management types like this? You know, supervisors who actually protect the hard working folks under them from other predatory managers? You, my friend, are a very, VERY lucky person. Don't ever leave that company. Buy stock and expect to retire from it. Your CIO is a gem."
"&gt;GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH

Or lacking that, copious amounts of alcoholic beverages."
"You overestimate STEM grad students. Lots of them only learn and do whatever necessary simplest way possible. This includes using code libraries for machine learning with just small param/var tweaks. Also the supercomputer cluster and CUDA computation probably already have a GUI or ""How-to-run"" guide somewhere and the student just need to submit the code while the system auto-run and scale."
"God better give me ""patience"" because if he gives me ""strength"", he'll need to give me ""bail money"" too."
"But it's virtual! I don't need any wires for my virtual linux boxes either. Can't you do something to make it work, like install new drivers or something?"
Following instructions?  What is this Kindergarten?
I would kill to have a boss like that.
"Our ""pager"" is a cell phone. When the customer calls the cell phone they get a voicemail stating that we're closed and that any help will be billable. If they leave a message we call them back and quote the price per hour (if it turns out to be on our side the fee gets waived). People tend not to need help anymore when they find out how much it'll cost them."
I remember once when I had a call from a client who was trying to restore his servers.  They had a flooding and full power loss.  He was in the process of trying to restore main power (the 440volt part).  We were going through that when he rather causally mentioned he was worried bout what the damage  would look like when he had drained the water he *was standing in.*
It just blows my mind how people can be this unaware of their surroundings.  How do you make it that far into life without the slightest shred of critical thinking.
"It was hers. Sure enough, she had put a hair elastic on top of the printer, and since her cat like to lay there, he batted it off into the paper feed tray. So, at least, not entirely her fault, in a way. More like 98% her fault. But she still broke the cardinal rule I had given her."
User is confused. When cable turns yellow it means it's slow but functioning. Cable turns red when it's down.
"I once got paged out at midnight for a printer issues.

""But you have eleven printers in here!""

""And *this* one is *mine!*"""
"I'll just out this over here, with the rest of the fire..."
"""You can't download a ~~car~~ monitor."""
"I appreciate the mutual facepalm kind person! This was funny in the end because we weren’t contracted to go out and help them at night, so it sort of taught them a lesson. She hasn’t been back in the “computer cupboard” since..."
"We have a client with an AC unit in their server room. One day, it started leaking. What did the office manager do? Did he call us? An HVAC company? The building manager? No. He took a hockey, put it under the leak, and went along his merry way. The only reason we found out about it was my technician walked into the room a couple hours later and almost kicked the bucket over.

Come to find someone left a manual for the AC unit inside the unit where it eventually shifted and blocked the exhaust.

The world is full of people that have absolutely no common sense."
My eyelid is now twitching and it hates you.
"&gt;Your CIO is a gem.

Yep. One of my first managers told me that his job was not to bother me about my work, but to protect me from other teams and management layers who tried to interfere.

I soon learned that that protection was very real and very useful."
"So, was it hers, or was it another elastic from the former roommate that just managed to evade detection until it shook loose and fell into the paper path after a few prints?"
"There's this chick I follow on Facebook. I accidentally started following her because she has the same name of this girl I met and thought I was sending a friend request to her. She was only 14 when I started following her. As soon as I realized she wasn't the person I was meaning to follow I went to unfollow her. But then I realized this 14 year old girl was hilariously stupid. She didn't know why America would send a separate team from Georgia to the Olympics, she couldn't figure out why elevators had buttons for the floor she was already on, and many other things I just saw and laughed. Anyway I never stopped following her because she was such a big source of my morning laughs.

She got pregnant at 15 because she thought you couldn't get pregnant on the first time. She was sure that the 15 year old boy that got her pregnant was going to be a great daddy. Well the kid is 1 now and she always complains about him never being around and how he would rather stay at home bored than see his son and all the other crap any of us could have warned her about when she was certain she was going to be the one teenage mom whose baby daddy would actually hang around.

Anyway the reason I bring all that up is that through these 2 years I've followed this complete moron she has never written ""your"" when she meant ""you're"". So if this person can get it right, then everyone can."
This is the point he was trying to make
If she’s in a psych ward that would explain a lot.
"My wife does that, I got in so much trouble once when I did some cleaning up on the pc to try and get it to stop locking up, I emptied the trash which had about 2GB of stuff in it.."
"Reminds me of something that happened last year.  Our help desk calls us with a priority 1 ticket, one of our sites is reporting that nobody can access the internet.  My coworker gets the info and starts dialing the user to get some additional info and see if she could power cycle one of the boxes.  Meanwhile I log into our RMM and check the site.  I see all of the desktops are online and a couple of laptops.  I send a Skype message to my coworker as he's on the phone with the users.  

Turns out that ""nobody""  was just her because she was the only person in the office at the time.  Further checking showed it was just a loose network cable plugging into her docking station."

The only time I was at a hospital and didn’t have access to my phone was when I was in inpatient mental health (psych ward). I’ve never heard of people not having access because they are in a hospital.
"Well. There you go.

Every. Single. Time. My mom in law can't print. 

It's because it's turned off."
"I talked to a guy once demanding I fix his internet **immediately** so that he could finish backing up his server before the flood water got any *further* up the rack.

Some people just don't get that computers and disasters don't really mix."
"A man sits on his porch watching the flood waters wash over his street when his neighbor drives up in his 4x4. ""Come on, we're evacuating, hop in!"" he shouted, but the man waved him off. ""I'm fine, God will save me.""

An hour later he's looking out his upstairs window at the flood waters lapping against the side of his house when the local police come along in a speedboat. ""Come on, we're evacuating, hop in!"" the officer shouted, but the man waved him off. ""I'm fine, God will save me.""

An hour after that he's clinging to his chimney, watching the waters lapping around his eavestroughs as a Coast Guard helicopter comes in overhead. ""Come on, you're being evacuated, hop in the basket!"" they blared over their loudspeakers. But the man waved them off. ""I'm fine! God will save me!""

An hour after that he arrives at the pearly gates having been swept away and drowned in the flood. In a huff he glares up Saint Peter and demands ""I was a good man, I had faith, why didn't God save me!?"" Saint Peter looked back at him and shrugged. ""We sent you a 4x4, a speedboat, and a helicopter. If you can't take a hint, that's on you.""

God gave you the tools to make a DR plan, if you don't use them, that's your own dumb fault. lol"
