Bingo. The firewall is def gonna have rules in a school environment to block any sort of VPN use. Talk about an easy way to get IT on your ass lol.
"Nah - that’s how it should be! Like obviously not at inappropriate times, because you should be respectful - and definitely understand that there will be times when you’re not both in the mood at the same time and that’s ok! But generally speaking yeah, you should def want to bone down with your significant other."

"Living? Gonna go with one of my uncles. He (and a lot of my family actually) used to be a criminal. I say used to be because hes been on the straight and narrow ever since my cousin was born, kinda like my parents with me. On the other hand, I dont know a whole lot of innocent people who suddenly drop everything, sell their house and move out of the country. Seems shady.

Ancestor wise? Def gonna go with my ancestors on my fathers side. They came to California much the same way as everyone else, in a wagon trail. Unfortunately, that wagon trail was called the Donner Party. Fortunately (or not, depending on your point of view) not a single member of their family was killed on the crossing. Which means they ate most everyone else."
