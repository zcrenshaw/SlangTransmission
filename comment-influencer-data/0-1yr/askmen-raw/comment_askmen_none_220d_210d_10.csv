226,Someone who I can dump my conspiracies into and gets actively involved in them with me. Who sees through my negatives while they also try to help me work on those said negatives. Who understands and is there for me. A woman with patience and kindness who sees the bigger picture in life’s absurd beauty. Who shows me hard truths and helps me grow as person for the betterment of myself and for those around me. Who I can talk to for hours making moments that seem mediocre exceptionally wonderful. She has to be good with people so I don’t have to be. Who fills me with life and purpose so that I can do the same for her. She has to like the gym and be my workout partner so we can get ft together. That’s is what my perfect wife would be like.

Whil I 'know' theres nothing wrong with crying, I still look down on myself when I have a hard time controlling it and I look at men as being weak when they do.  Again, I know its wrong and I really dont think theyre weak or theres anything wrong with it...I just really hate the idea of not being in control of your emotions.  "

That way I'll have a much more realistic idea of her availability and be more able to understand why a new relationship will be a bit less of a priority for her than a woman without dependants. I guess it would just help me make a better decision about things and set my expectations appropriately."
362,"I think this logic extends past just the sending of dick pics. I think this misunderstanding is the source of a lot of the negative attention women get from men. Men are just treating women the way that the men want to be treated, and men translate the actions of a woman through ""the golden rule"". I think it's why you get the victim blaming and the claims that a woman asked for it by the way they dress. Guys see women with low cut tops and short skirts (bringing attention to sexual parts of the body), and they interpret that type of outfit as a signal that the women are DTF. Why? Because if a guy puts his sex organ on display in a comparable way, he is sending a strong message about what he's after.

Women aren't men though. Women don't want to be treated like men want to be treated."

380,"Yes! Some guys get toothy. I actually thought I didn’t like it at all for quite awhile. 

First thing I’d say is that the high points are the same. Your enjoyment of it is paramount. Eye contact is good. Everyone is different. The question marks are similar too. Personally teasing and kissing and touching other parts of my body makes it a more whole experience, but some people’s insecurities or dominance preferences make them dislike it. I like it when someone makes pleasure sounds and tells me how much they love it. Some don’t. Important stuff to know: does she like more focus on the clit/hood, does she prefer vaginal stimulation, or is a combo what works best? Fooling around with the labia minora doesn’t really do it for most people, guys. Does she like getting some over the panties stuff first? Nipple play? Gentle, aggressive, or combo? Fast, slow, or combo? Steady rhythm or free form? Some stuff that I *think* is pretty safe to say across the board: don’t let your tongue go completely soft and just mash it around in there. It doesn’t do anything. Also don’t point the tip of your tongue and press in hard. There are a lot of nerves there and this hurts. It also hurts to rub your dry finger across the clit. Think about how friction feels for you and then magnify the shit out of it. It’s unpleasant. One thing about women is that we’re (a lot of us anyway) conditioned to make sounds that can mislead you on how much we’re enjoying it. It’s a hard habit to break. Pay attention to facial expressions, weird sounds, muscle twitches, goosebumps, involuntary stuff. Ask. Questions. Be attentive. For me I need the person to move back and forth between being sensual and affectionate and being aggressive and in charge. Make me cum again when I don’t want to anymore, and be extra sweet after. But again, everyone is different. I noticed that I tend to make out in the way that I like someone to go down on me, so consider that as a possible indicator, but I have no idea if other people do this. Good luck to you!"

397,When I was younger I drew a anime MILF onto a piece of paper with her ass taking up most of it and just a bit of her breasts showing while she was looking back.

401,Yeah that's where I knew she was getting at but there's also a good chance that a good looking guy gets wayy better reception and results from being that straight forward than an ugly guy even with consideration to rejection. The ugly guy would get a hard no be ridiculed or ghosted and rejected whereas the better looking guy would get a soft no and still be a viable option for later.

Jokes aside, I don’t follow this line of thinking for no reason. It’s been beaten into my head my many friends and acquaintances that that’s something blatantly disrespectful to do, no matter how it’s done or how much sense it doesn’t make, and I can’t help but think that way.

The biggest issue that I see is that what constitutes “straightforward” and “disrespectful” isn’t universal. Some want you to use the term “sex” explicitly, some don’t want to hear the word at all, sometimes the most you can do is hint at everything (“I don’t want anything serious”, which could mean just casual sex or it could mean you just want to be friends), and some just get pissed off regardless of how it’s done. Shits frustrating tbh. 

Maybe I just live around particularly conservative women (lol Bible Belt), but this train of thinking seems to persist even among my “progressive” friends. In fact, it’s actually most common amongst them tbh"

So, are you saying I should only date men I'm not attracted to? Because there are many flaws in that thinking. First of all, you're assuming I'm only attracted to very stereotypically attractive men, but that's not the case. You're also assuming that all good looking men are asshole, and less attractive men are never assholes, also not true. Also, the last man I dare was a guy I wasn't very attracted to. I dated him because he was sweet at first, and we had a lot in common. Even he started to exhibit some disrespectful behavior, and I had to break up with him for various reason. I felt like a cunt because I may have lead him on even though I tried to be honest. So it's really really not as black and white as you think things are."

518,You could replace human being with “person” you sound like a robot when you talk.

750,"The best thing in life is living in the moment.  People seek it all the time.  My favorite is a dangerous situation where your life and well being depends on total concentration and impeccable decision making.  Other people meditate or practice mindfulness.    Living in the modern world is about scattered awareness, you wouldn't survive without having that, a million distractions and quite of few of them are important to keep checking in on.  I think someone from a more simple society would be freaked out at how many things they have to be aware of to navigate a city safely.  But we take it all in as a matter of course.  Maybe you need to teach your mind how to be mindful and live in the moment, it's a skill like anything else."

757,"Obviously there are still going to be plenty of women that are stuck up about being asked for sex only, but I'm not sure how else you'd go about it other than tricking them into liking you and then dumping them when you're done, which is obviously the wrong thing to do. If you're only looking for casual sex I'd say the only option is being up front about it. If you're rejected by someone that finds that disrespectful, then I guess you'd just have to move on to the next one. Every woman is going to take things differently. I don't find it to be disrespectful to be honest about your feelings. I'd rather not have my time wasted "

768,"The retail trap is real and unless you literally know a guy with power for tangible advancement who isn't leaving the company anytime soon or you are said ""guy"", in a lot of ways it's not worth the time grinding away. It shouldn't be seen as a place for the long haul.

 Especially with retailers in general being in rough shape, those plug and play, be here for 10+ years, get to higher levels of corporate and secure the easy 6 figure district manager gigs where you literally just check up on stores in your region, can move around anywhere in the country and have a lot of the physical leg work on someone under you, sort of jobs just don't really exist anymore. A lot of the older fuckers aren't retiring in numbers like they used to, it's cheaper to condense responsibilities to one guy for less pay instead of paying multiple people  and it's extremely easy to cap out hardcore.

Now yes obviously if you're in a position where you can't afford to be picky, retail is better than thumbing your ass broke at home, but it's not a place to carve out a career due to how  arguably the skills are only going to translate in one particular place.

794,"Not exactly... the usage of social stuff like that is indicative of what people lack irl, not what people like or don't like. Girls have an abundance of one-night stands available to them irl, so they don't seek them out on social media because they don't have to, as they can get one at any time. They don't, however, have a relationship available to them at all times irl, so they seek that out on social media. The lack of girls seeking one-night stands on social media is not indicative of their opinion of one-night stands. Additionally, views of one-night stands are varied across the spectrum, so I'm not saying all girls like one-night stands. Not all guys like one-night stands, either. So I'm saying, just simply, that girls in general like one-night stands just as much as guys, in general, like one-night stands. It's worth mentioning that the taboo placed on girls would skew the ""statistics"" on social media, because a girl doesn't want to be viewed unfavorably by society (not my views, but a lot of people think that way) so she would avoid any characterization that she enjoyed one-night stands for fear of being perceived as a whore. I consider myself a ranking expert as the dude all my girlfriends were comfortable talking about this stuff with (read: the friend zoned guy). I mean... to prove my point... every guy who has a one-night stand with a girl has to have a girl have the one-night stand with him. Proving that just as many girls like one-night stands as guys, as they both have to be present for one to happen. "
