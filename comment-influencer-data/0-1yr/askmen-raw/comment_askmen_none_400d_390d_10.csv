5,"After years of evolutionary and psychological research, the committee president approached the podium. The chamber bustled with anticipation. The white noise of hushed speculation dissipated as the president cleared his throat. 

""Ladies and gentlemen... They bounce!""

The chamber exploded into applause."
6,"one theory about why human breasts developed to be full and round at all times (rather than just while nursing like in all other primates) state that as humans began to walk upright and thus started mating face-to-face, full breasts were selected for as a visual stimuli by males because they “imitated” a full and healthy backside. That’s right, some scientists think boobs evolved to be front butts. Amazing. "

9,"Most trends are stupid.  Pogs, the Macarena, JeanCo jeans, saying ""Wazzzzuuuuuuppp!""...

Pop culture does odd things and most of them are quickly forgotten.

Fortnite looks fun though, although I'm not about to jump in that hole, as I hate online games.

Edit:  I meant JNCO's.  It's been nearly two decades.  Cut me some slack."
10,"Boy this isn't going to be a hostile thread at all....

While engineering majors tend to have big egos in my experience, nursing majors take the cake. They do great things, but you're ALWAYS hearing about how their life sucks, their major sucks, they have no time for anything etc. It's like the world has to stop when a nursing major walks in the door because they have to explain why they're a nursing major. It's like joining the army and bitching about getting shot at."
11,"I'm more than a decade out of college but speaking as an English major... English majors. The level of pretension when you hit 500 level literature and writing classes is unreal. I'm sure every major has their share of ""that guy"" but phew. Just people carrying around Faulkner talking about how they like to relax by reading anything from obscure 1950s poets to virtually unknown 18th century fiction. Unreal. "

But not nearly as insufferable as nursing students. I dated one for a while and Jesus she would not shut up about how hard it is to be a nurse. "
16,Stick her finger in your mouth. Hold your mouth in the same shape until you get to the jewellery place.
17,"I would agree with the guys logic. If you're inexperienced or still shy due to being with a new partner, its fine to take time, but if this will carry on with the same partner, it will definitely be a turn off"
18,I love your titties cause they prove I can focus on two things at once 
19,"No, never. My work in a female dominated field means I have a variety of women tactfully mentioning they have a boyfriend every day. Not that I'm trying to date in the work place but it is a reminder that I am not very attractive."
20,Sounds like you need a new boyfriend 
21,Can't have an std if you've never had sex. Checkmate bitches 
22,"I have a friend I met in college, she and I had fantastic sex, but we went our seperate ways. I got married, served in the military, got divorced, got out, and moved back home. In the meantime she got her doctorate and began practicing.  When I got back home, she was in a relationship, but we caught up. Shortly there after I was in a relationship and she was single. It went back and forth like that for a while, one of us single the other in a relationship. Then our ""singleness"" synced up and we dated for a few months, however I just got a promotion at work, and she got offered a job on the other side of the country. Fast forward a few years and we are both single, both stuck in our careers, she on the East Coast, I on the West. We both have houses, cars, etc. But we can't be together despite both being in our mid 30s. We talk all the time and are the first person the other calls when we have a problem of any kind. We encourage each other to go get laid, and talk about the people we both find and bring home. But neither of us is able to be with the other, and we both regret not having children yet, despite our careers."
23,"You kinda grow out of this eventually, but what really sped up the process for me was meeting some of these girls at the bar and getting the gist of their personalities.

My crushes are few and far between now."
24,Film majors are snobby as fuck. Had a guy scoff at me because I said lord of the rings was my favourite movie 
25,I set expectations of others without communicating it and then get upset when they don't meet those expectations. As far as correcting it goes I think practicing open communication is all you can do. 
26,"Students who do business school right out of high school think they're the shit, but business students who transfer in are a lot more humble. "
27,"Honestly I got asked his very often and tbh it's perfectly fine. Although I do feel the same, i.e. return the favor"
28,Take it from an old guy. Great sex has nothing to do with how good looking someone is. 
29,Can't say I've gotten any nudes in a long time. I'd have to assume because it's much more personal when someone sends *you* nudes. More so than just finding them on the internet

Edit: I did not propose to her with that ring, it was just a nice ring."
33,Third one wants to manipulate people.
34,"Not anymore but once upon a time I did. Lots of inappropriate comments and unnecessary touching, stuff that would’ve gotten me thrown in HR prison if the roles were reversed. The thing that annoyed me the most was how every woman in the office suddenly became disabled when it came time for stuff to be moved around. Why should they do anything when the big strong man can do it for them? It wasn’t uncommon to hear “but you’re a man, that’s your job!” and it was always so tempting to ask where my sandwich was since they were so big on gender roles all of a sudden. But again, HR prison. "
35,A ton. When my space is tidy it's easier to focus.

39,"I was never in a female dominated field, but I've been in a female dominated workplace.

I didn't experience anything until about a year and a half in. I was promoted to team lead. The women who were there before me were pretty cool. I had a few interested in me, but they recognized limits. Went to Florida to help train a call center's staff. Also had some interested, but they were classy. Then I got back home and we got a training class...

It was 100% women. I think maybe 20 in there. 4 of them fucked with me HARD. Touching, propositioning, texting my phone all times of night. 

I had to call HR eventually. "
40,"I don't think any one major was worse than the other, in my experience. Just about every group had their assholes.

For philosophy, it was the younger people who thought they understood everything because they were jaded and pedantic.

For pre-med and engineering, it was the people who thought every other field was adorably simple or unnecessary.

For theatre it was the people who thought everyone else was uncultured.

For psychology it was the people who thought they understood all human behavior because they took an intro class."
41,"Happy I don't see geology on here yet. Just a bunch of kids who like rocks and beer more than they like people so everyone is pretty chill.

Yes we do love our puns as well as our (GODDAMNIT MARIE) minerals.

42,"&gt;Not that I'm trying to date in the work place but it is a reminder that I am not very attractive.

Met this one girl during refresher training, and it was her first week on the job.

Thanks. Thanks a lot."

56,"You know, I've been going through your responses to all the advice you've been given, and I definitely see a lot of myself in you when I was your age (I'm 30 btw for some context). 

You don't feel like you can be the best version of yourself without having a woman. You'd only be motivated to better yourself if it was for them and not for yourself. You are literally starving for validation, not just physical validation but emotional validation. 

I bet you lie in bed at night imagining what it'd be like. Am I right? The feeling of a warm body curled up next to you a night. How their fingers would feel like on your skin. To know they care and trust you enough to be so vulnerable with you, so open. And you with them. And then the fear that you'll never get that pops into your head, and it crushes you to think that of all the billions of souls on this miserable little planet, you are the one who gets left out. 

I know. I did all that. 

And you know what? You're right. You are not in the right place for a relationship. Because you're like a dog chasing a car at this point. You wouldn't know what to do when you catch it. And odds are it'd slip through your fingers and you'd be more broken for the loss. 

Listen to the people giving you all this critical and important advice. Because I didn't before it was ""too late."" And really, it's not too late. You're approaching thirty, not ninety. Learn to be self-reliant, self-assured, become the best you can be on your own, not because you're doing it for someone else, but because you're doing it for you. Learn to love yourself first, before you go trying to love anyone else. 

It makes things easier. It will no doubt make the numerous rejections you'll get easier because, it's okay you're fine with yourself and can move on to better prospects. And when someone does come along you will be building from a much stronger foundation. So that, god forbid, if they leave you and tear down the version of yourself they helped you build, you still have something strong to fall back on. And building yourself up also means you won't just fall into the first relationship you get, and stay there because you're so afraid of being alone again, despite how horrible the woman may end up being when you get to know her. It can happen. It does happen. So learn to be comfortable in your own skin, comfortable being alone. So that, if you end up dating a harpy you can confidently tell them to go to hell and find someone better who is worth your time and love. 

And don't listen to all the nay-sayers who say there's no hope. Because it's easy to fall into believing that's true, and if you believe it, then your going to act accordingly and end up making a self-fulfilling prophecy."
57,This seriously sounds like some moves need to be made. You two are basically together almost. 
58,I get clingy very easily
59,"“Sent a dick pic”???

*that escalated quickly*"
60,I told myself that loving someone doesn't necessarily mean I have to like them. I live far away and talk maybe once every 2 weeks. It's all superficial stuff nothing too deep. I have no interest in being friends with them . 
61,"The gym is filled with men putting tremendous effort into how they look.  Hundreds of dollars in top fashion only goes so far when you're putting it on a formless blob, so men put their effort in at the ground level.

As long as you're not dressed like a total slob, a good physique will cure all fashion ills."
62,"I’m in my 30s, still single, cant seem to find anyone to even go on dates with me. I deal with the inevitability of me being forever single by keeping myself busy. I have a motorcycle, I travel, I play video games, I go to concerts and festivals.  "
63,HA HA! THIS UNIT LAUGHS AT YOUR MISFORTUNE TO DISTRACT ITSELF FROM THE PAIN OF SIMILAR EXPERIENCES
64,"I've been a male nurse for quite a few years. I've never experienced any sexual harassment from ANY of my co-workers, it comes from patients. When it happens, i'm fairly blunt in telling them that is not okay and will not be tolerated. 

If you're looking at nursing you, as a male, will be expected to handle certain things. Twice a year, I change the clocks on my unit. Every month I update the calendars. This is half because it's a pet peeve and half because I don't feel like watching my 5' nothing co-workers fall off of a chair trying to do these tasks. No one has ever actually asked me to do it, I just do. 

When I first started in nursing on a long term care floor, I had the heavy patients every shift. I thought it was because I was male and I confronted my charge nurse about the assignments. Wasn't because I was male, was because I was new. It stopped after I confronted her. 

Don't ever let your guard down if you're alone in a room with a female. Treat your co-workers with the same respect you would like, generally speaking you'll get it. "
65,Just to have a conversation? Never. 
66,"Can I make a list? I'm going to make a list.

- Law students are some of the most pretentious people I've ever met. Passing first year crim law with a 50% doesn't give you the authority to second-guess the Chief Justice in a 4000 word Facebook post.
- Engineering students... you probably already know.
- Accounting students rocking up to their first year lectures already wearing ties and button ups, the cringe. Half of you will probably end up failing anyway.
- I worry for the future of my country when I think of how many airheaded education majors I've met. 
- Pol sci students... having a conversation with them is like if /r/LATESTAGECAPITALISM was a real person.
- ""Woe is me"" med students. Yes, it's stressful. Yes, it's demanding. And yes, you knew this all when you applied, and we're a little tired of hearing about it."
67,"I knew I was going to marry my GF when about 1 year In I was broke as a joke, got a gig working the state fair 12/13 days working slave labor from 9am-3pm. Took one day off four days in to spend with her. 

We went out, got wine drunk but have a great time overall. Good sex, and a solid re-charge. Morning comes early, rooms still spinning and I'm running late.  So I catch an uber and leave my truck at her house, because the parking there is $20-30 a day. I barley made it in on time. I had texted her on my break that if she had the time / resources to drop my truck off that'd be amazing. I was half joking because it's a bear of a task for her to drive 20 miles, drop it off and then uber back home. 

I spend a miserable day hung over doing shit work and to my delight I come home to my truck outside. I was amazed. That's enough to win my love over. I get home to my shitty 4-roommate bachelor pad, walk into my formerly nightmare mess of a room to an immaculately clean, bed made, laundry done &amp; folded, basket of candy and a love letter noting dinner in the fridge. In the morning I come to find my truck had the oil changed and gas tank full (two things I couldn't afford to do as a I didn't have a pot to piss in). I cried, and will wife that beautiful bitch up one day. "

A huge amount of them are wolf of wall street/Jordan belfort wannabes.A lot of them think once they grad, they'll get to be managers, prancing around telling people what to do. The funny thing is a lot of them don't even like the major, they just did it because mom and dad told them they had to go to college and major in something.

Also liberal art majors, specifically philosophy majors are pretentious af."
71,"After dating for a month, my current girlfriend and I agreed that we each get tested.  I had taken the test about 6 months prior, I wasn’t too concerned.  Took the test and found out I had Chlamydia.  Could have gone a long time not knowing I got an STI from that awful, drunken, one night stand with my brother’s ex-girlfriend."
72,"Eventually it gets old and dampens the excitement of exploring and engaging sexually.

I went back and watched some cartoons from my childhood and realized they were just as bad as the ones on now. We all just remember them fondly because we were the target demographic when we watched them, and have some emotional attachment/nostalgia associated with them. And a bit of survivorship bias, the truly bad cartoons have been forgotten.

Case in point, my generation's version of dabbing was the macarena.

85,"Many things. I'm kind of a girlfriend apologist because I love mine of four years so damn much...

1. She got me tickets to see my favorite band for my birthday. It's a bucket-list item for me to be at one of their concerts at all, and now I'm going.

2. She thought that it *wasn't enough* to just get me those tickets, and also got me other gifts.

3. That other birthday where she dressed up in lingerie and re-enacted the ""Jingle-Bell Rock"" scene from Mean Girls.

4. She's from the country and I'm from the city. On our first date she stayed the night and while we messed around we didn't have sex, just fell asleep next to each other. She woke up at 2am and thought that the streetlight was dawn breaking and woke me up. She figured if it was dawn, then it was an okay time to have sex. It took me telling her afterwards that it was actually the middle of the night.

5. The moment I went from lust to love, when on our second date we were driving through town and she saw a billboard for a pizza place. She said ""Ooooh... bacon bacon *bacon* pizza. That sounds good.""

I'm not saying she's perfect, but she's fucking perfect for me."
86,Because women have breasts.
87,"&gt; Is this true, 

yes. we want you to be comfortable and happy, both in general and specifically while having sex. 

&gt; does self consciousness a turn off for you?

yes and no. I have a big thing for sincerity, and that means having an appreciation for people's idiosyncrasies. I don't mind working around her insecurities so long as she's working with me. "
88,"I've gone through undergrad and grad school at this point.

I have to say, engineering students are the worst. They judge every other major as pointless and beneath them. Had one tell me that my doctorate (psych) is worthless and that he could write a program to do what I do. He was aghast when I agreed that both my *and* his job could be done by computers."

121,"After going to my first radiation treatment for cancer I told my wife that because of the drive/distance/logistics of having to go all the way home from work to get her to drive *all the way* back to the hospital just for a short appointment/treatment logistically made not much sense in my mind.  I figured I could just go myself, get it done and just come back home.  It made sense to me in my head as I am mechanically minded in that way...if that makes sense.

I got to the hospital and checked in just to find her sitting there in the waiting-room.  I love my wife for being there for me even though I said she didn't have to."

126,"And that guy's a social worker? Not an expert, but that sounds like a red flag."
127,"Similar to me but in a factory gig. She said ""I wasn't a real man!"" I replied ""If im not a real man then you arn't a real woman for stepping out of the kitchen.""

The HR meeting was hilarious to me. I used the ""I thought we were bantering"" defense, when my nearly in tears coworker said she wasn't as was filing a formal grievance I said sure.

Get me  the paperwork to fill out against her  in the same way she was against me. Problem was her work history couldn't afford another write-up. I could. She then agreed we were '""just joking"""
128,"In college I was doing a group project and one of the few girls in the engineering program was in my group. She hadn't emailed her portion of the work in, and was the type to get guys to do all the work for her. I saw her at the campus store, and walked up to her to ask her to email in her portion of the work due tomorrow. Before I was even withing conversation distance she loudly shot a ""I have a boyfriend"" at me. 

She knew I was in her group, so I have to imagine that even the perception of me propositioning her was unacceptable. 

Like I knew I was not attractive, I didn't need that loudly proclaimed. I've since lost a ton of weight, got muscular, and dress reasonably well. Still haven't been able to shake that. "

There is nothing wrong with concentrating on yourself so that you can't be fooled like me at 59 by a total narcissist. But know that there is someone out there for you and all you have to do is be ready.

144,"Male secretary here, in a workplace where I'd say 95% of secretaries are female, and 95% of supervisors.

I don't think I've been the recipient of sexual harassment as far as I can recall (although sometimes I wonder if I'm just oblivious - there's one supervisor who's always been super, super nice to me, though she may just be, you know, nice), but every now and then I feel like there's a little very subtle discrimination.

In work parties where there's a random drawing for a prize, virtually all of the prizes are kinda' skewed toward the sort of stuff that females typically have more interest in. Scrapbook stuff, cutesy coffee mugs. Once, I won a little sewing kit, but that's actually been one of my most prized items at work - it's come in really handy when I've had to make emergency repairs to pants.

At other times, it's clear that the girls have formed their own little social cliques, particularly the smokers. I don't know if it's being a guy that's kinda' kept me more on my lonesome, but I do wonder sometimes.

In the end, it doesn't really faze me much. I'm not at work to make friends, and if I get occasional trinkets at work functions I don't care for, it's not like I'm any worse for the wear. I just have to shake my head when something like that comes up and I'm like, ""Really? Would it have been that difficult to make your little prize something that might better appeal to everyone, like movie tickets or an Amazon gift card?""

But by and large, these are just nitpicks. I think even if genders were reversed, I wouldn't see a need to scream out ""discrimination!"""

149,"Male nurse here also. You give it the best summary. Constant lifting. Constant expectation just to ""handle it"" because you're a man whereas the girls will always complain or ask for a new assignment. That being said I always ask a female nurse to handle any vaginal related task. Even Foley's. If the patient is younger I don't put on their telemetry monitor, I ask one of the girls to do it. I see it as a fair trade for all the lifting we have to do. 
I get sexually harassed by patients quite often. I just ignore it. It is really frustrating though how bad the double standard is. Women are completely shameless when they come at us. "

152,"It is 'a' theory, but evolutionary psychology is really a hotbed of personal opinions made into science, so I would take most everything that comes out of it with a grain of salt. 


A more to the point explanation would be that full breasts look like they are good at feeding babies, another is that breasts remind an individual of the breasts of their mother when they were the most safe they ever were. That last one would explain why almost everyone likes breasts, even a lot of women. 


There probably is a whole plethora of reasons that interconnect with each other, but just boobs = the new ass is just one of the many explanations, and probably not the most important one. "

I mean, athletic wear is one thing, but the fact that my bosses *wouldn't stop staring at me.* It was really awkward. I was also the thinnest man employed there by like 40 lbs., and being tall/having muscle on me as well made them pretty forward about it.

170,"I had a real weakness for this woman. We first became friends at 14, but by the time she confessed how she felt about me, I was dating someone else.

We went back and forth like that for a few years until she was dating a friend of mine who wasn't treating her very well, and wouldn't listen to me when I told him he had to do better. So I ended that friendship by basically asking her to be with me instead, and it worked, for a few weeks.

She started this cycle where she would show up at my door, confess her undying love, only to skip town and disappear a week or two later. This happened maybe three times over a few years. Then I got married, and eventually divorced, and she was there,  waiting for me to be single.

This time we lasted 6 months before she did it again. I told her I couldn't keep doing this and said goodbye and lost her info. She's had a really hard life, which I think is the main reason I wanted to be with her. I cared a lot about her, and just wanted to give her stability and take care of her. I hope she's doing well, but I just can't invest myself in that again."

I get a lot of attention, smiles, playful friendly touching and whatnot but never anything that has crossed the line. Frankly, not used to the attention of so many females, so I’m not the best at picking out whether something is harassment or not. 

I have hairy arms which people are fascinated by, as no one has arm hair here. Even the school principle took the time to stroke my arm hair in amazement. Doesn’t stress me. The children call me monkey, which is a little bit of a hit to the self esteem, but they don’t really know any better. 

A lot of the same sexism stuff that people have mentioned, but even more exaggerated because China. If something’s broken, we’re always called to help out. Air con, electricity, computer. Then every time something remotely large (even if it’s super light weight) needs to be carried, the principle comes to find us 2 men. A lot of audible gasping and “wooow” every time we pick up something heavy. Don’t know what that’s about.

The truth is a lot of us men are, handsome. It just takes some tweeting with style, clothing, posture, body language, hair styles. A men's support group could be a place to discuss these topics and encourage each other like ""bro that shirt makes you look good man"" and where you didnt' have to say ""no-homo"" because you know helping build your bros confidence is important.

I suggested that I go, due to my good relationship with the board, and also because they are usually not friendly to women. I was accused of being sexist and told that I shouldn't get involved.

The second time they were there,, they had gotten 4 placards, and wrote 3 tickets. And yes, people were also creating parking spots in the fire lane, or in red.. blocking other cars from driving by.

How can you have a masters in IT security and not be able to give me a high level overview of how TLS works?

Every year, a guy emails the graduating class and offers to do their final year projects for an insanely high price. Every year, about 50% accept. Last year, he was delayed sending them on their final projects, so a bunch of them threatened him. He said ""fuck it"" and stopped replying (he'd already made more than enough money). So one of them contacts me the night before he's supposed to be demoing the project to ask for ""advice"" on how to finish it. I meet up with him, he has 4 other people with him... they don't even know how to open the solutions to demo their projects. They tell me this whole story... and explain that all their parents know and were paying the guy... and that they're going to contact the police about it.

I stopped eating as much, because the kids needs came first. By the time I got a job again, I'd lost 30lbs. 3 months later, I hate my job, and barely make enough to get by. I get on the scale again, even lighter. Down 45lbs since January. This sounds like excellent news to most people, but I feel unhealthy, broken, and unattractive. My face is sunken in, and I feel like I look like a skeleton. I'm finally skinny enough for some of my old skinny jeans, but my ass and legs look non existent.

228,"I'd say that more and more, men are putting a lot of effort into their appearance. We don't necessarily wear makeup, but lots of us put time and money into building a better wardrobe and a ton of us invest time and effort at the gym to look as in shape as possible. I think you're underestimating the amount of effort men expend on appearance.

You're also discounting the fact that women aren't just looking for appearance when they date. A lot of women still see financial security as a big part of dating, so men that invest time into their careers are essentially making themselves more attractive."

259,"There's this unhealthily understanding that we need to be happy at all times, or else we're doing something wrong. The reality is that happiness, like every other emotion we have, is fleeting. It will come and go like a sad, rainy afternoon, or a frustrating Thursday night on your way home from work. 

I would recommend you coming to terms with the phrase ""being content"". I think this is a much more healthy goal to chase and maintain. I'd argue that being content comes much more easily when you have a stable home, income, and access to food. Your basic necessities, like out of that one guy's (Abraham Maslow as pointed out below) hierarchy of needs. Once the necessities are sorted, you can look into the things that excite you. What changes would you like to make? What would you like to experience? If such a sufficient goal becomes clear, set a clear path toward it. It doesn't have to be immediate or anything, but it should be important to you. We're dynamic creatures in a dynamic world. Spice things up. Do scary things. 

Happiness is not the end all, be all. We could all probably think of a bunch of things that would make us happier than we are now. But you gotta remember that happiness doesn't stay around forever. Being content with who you are, what you choose to do, how you affect people around you should be our focus. It is in my experience and in what I could learn from the experiences of my mother, my brother, my uncles and aunts, my friends, that contentment is one of the few lasting things we'll know. It is in our concious control, not in our emotions, that we decide whether we are content or not. "
260,"I was raised by a perpetually single mother until my early teens.She met my stepdad and they got married. He treated me like his own and took care of my brother and I.  After I was out of the house and grown, she up and leaves him saying she never really loved him and just wanted help raising her kids. It destroyed him financially, emotionally, and he is just a shell of the man he was. He had to restart life in his late 50s, has no idea how / if hes going to retire, on multiple psych meds now for issues relating to the hell she did upon him. I will NEVER consider a single mom thanks to my own mother. Of course not all women are like this, but her cold and calculating form showed me the evil side of women that I will never forget for the rest of my life.

This led to a mountain of lawsuits from legitimately disabled people who didn't need a wheelchair.  Assuming someone is not disabled just by looking at them is some real dangerous territory.  There are hundreds if not thousands of legit reasons that someone without a wheelchair would need to park close.  My great aunt for example, she had people screaming in her 90 year old face for using a handicap spot and placard.  She was severely diabetic, she was fine sitting down, but could only stand for so long and could collapse at any moment.

301,"I met my best friend my freshman year of high school. She and I got along very well and the relationship between us was totally platonic. We got so close, to the point that many people thought we were a couple, and if they knew that we weren't together they would pressure us to go out. We kinda stopped talking sophomore year because we didn't have any classes together, but junior year we started getting back in touch. Come the summer before senior year and I begin to catch feelings for her. I eventually asked her out but things just didn't work out. We stayed very close friend until we went to college, she went to Boston and I stayed in LA. We would hang out over breaks and stayed in touch, but we ended up not being as close anymore.

Come graduate school, where we both ended up going to New York for our studies. She studied theater while I studied music. We ended up getting a place together and lived as roommates the 2 years we did our masters. She had her relationships and I had mine, she was family at that point. 

Our friendship was very complicated, we got into arguments every so often and constantly questioned the nature of our relationship. Both of us suffer from some sort of depression and very often that put us at odds. Logically, nothing about out relationship makes sense, but somehow we've managed to outlast everyone else in our lives. 

After we both went through a tough breakup with other people, I decided to take a crack at it again and I asked her out. We ended up going on the first date I had planned when I was in high school, and we hit it off. That was last year and now were planning on moving to Paris for me to do my doctoral work. I honestly have not clue how this is gonna work out, but I've been the happiest I've ever been.

We had a few who would hang around in my uni's history department and they were very pretentious and self-important. Hell, there was even a guy who would frequently brag about reading *Ulysses* multiple times and understanding it (same deal with Finnegan's Wake), to give an example that still stands out in my mind because of how pretentious the guy was. 

Also the general idea of the English majors being patricians that only enjoy the *best* of the true artists writing ""literary fiction,"" with us people that like to read a variety of things not including ""literary fiction"" being low-brow plebs. 

The uni was a private one so there was a bit of a classist element to it too.

That being said, I would say more than anything, just be open to thoughts and suggestions, and be prone to random conversations, about anything, thoughts feelings, emotions, rants, arguments, debates.

Personally if I were to be part of a male support group, I would want to know that sharing my thoughts and emotions to the group is acceptable and above all welcome. We don't have enough of that in our lives. A sort of emotional conversation among men. And I get that not all men want to be all touchy feely with feelings, but at the same time, don't shame men for wanting to open up more."

Attraction to legs can come from specific interests/fetishes so that attraction is partially nurture/environment/personality based, but it's also instinctual in the sense that you can get a good indication as to whether a female (or any human for that matter) is underweight, overweight, or a healthy enough weight/fitness level to be a safe mating partner just by looking at their legs.

However can I blame them for choosing a sexual partner over me? Eh, not really, that’s human nature. Most of my male friends distanced from me after getting a gf, presumably out of respect for the new relationship/due to lingering feelings for me, and they did what was right for them.

341,"You've gotten a ton of replies but my husband taught me something that I feel might be elucidating for you.

The reason men crave sex so much is because it's an indicator of their worth as a person, evolutionarily speaking.  The most attractive, most reliable, most desirable men are able to attract mates, while the ones who don't stack up in comparison for whatever reason struggle and fail in their attempts.  Of course there are other reasons someone might or might not be able to have sex or attract a partner, but these are the base/primal scenarios.

Men seek approval from women, in part, because it's an objective measure of how well they stack up.  Immature, unattractive, or otherwise unappealing men have to work a lot harder, and start to get callous and desperate in their search for self-esteem.  It's also a vicious cycle, because the more rejected you feel, the more desperate you are, and start to do things like beg women you barely know for nudes.

The reason pornography doesn't work is precisely because it's available to everyone.  It can satisfy a physical urge - the need to cum - but it doesn't give the guy any real validation or indication that he's desirable, which is the psychological need that sex fills.  So that's why it's not a substitute.  If you ask a woman for nudes, and she sends them to you, on some level she's approving of you as a person, showing you trust, saying that she sees you in a sexual way, and that feels good to a guy.

It's safe to say, btw, that if a random guy is asking you for nudes, he's pretty desperate.  It's totally fair to reject him.  That's the only way he'll learn that to earn approval and desire from women, he has to actually work to make himself an interesting and attractive guy, and not just beg for it like a child.  Of course it might be different if someone you've been dating for a while and actually care about asks for them, but if he's a good guy he should also be strong and confident enough to handle a ""no"".

TL;DR - Straight/bi guys crave validation from women.  Sex is a very primal form of this validation.  Guys who can't get laid (often justifiably) feel insecure about their worth, and so become more desperate in the search for any glimpse of this validation."

On the management side, it was a lot better. People were more relaxed, a lot friendlier. I was kind of the quiet dude but literally everyone would try to make conversation with me and was it was also appreciated.

351,When I was in highschool many of the girls dated guys that were in their 20s. I had a huge crush on this girl and we were both 16.

352,"I work in public health. Everyone who ever has sex, especially without condoms, should get tested. 

My agency offers STI testing, and my particular role is HIV case management. So many of my clients got infected due to an unfaithful partner 10+ years into their supposedly monogamous relationship. 

And the testing department often sees people who make sure nothing is being mailed to their home because their SO doesn't know that they're at risk. 

Make getting tested the norm, then it doesn't have to be done in secret or be an issue of trust if brought up!

Edit: also most cases of Chlamydia and gonorrhea are asymptomatic, especially in males, and unchecked can cause sever organ damage and death. It's a good idea to just get checked.

Edit 2: because this post is somewhat visible, just another PSA: For those who may be or become pregnant, *tell* the doctor to test you for HIV. It is required that doctors in the US check all pregnant people for HIV unless they opt out. If those women are semi-well off financially and in a monogamous relationship, the doctor's often opt out *on the patient's behalf.* Afaik, that's illegal, but it still happens pretty frequently (two of my female clients found out they were positive after having children, when the most recent possibility for infection was before they were pregnant, and they were never asked about the HIV test at all."

385,"You're in the same boat as a lot of us men. Women get way, WAY more attention than we do, so our SOs get a lot of attention from other men. It's a fact of life for us, and it drives some of us crazy.  

Here's the key: If you worry about every swingin' dick out there (or set of flapping lips, in your case) you'll drive yourself bonkers, make yourself AND your SO miserable and it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. At which point, you'll of course blame the ho and not your own crazy.\* This cycle may repeat, and that really sucks. 

I see it happen all the time. The secret is to realize and internalize, you know, really believe and know (the way religious people know Jesus is their BFF) that you don't need to trust every ho with a sandwich out there, you only need to trust one person: your SO. 

Easy to say, hard AF to do. But you can do it. And if you do it, man you can just relax. Because it doesn't matter what hot lipped babe comes up to your man. It doesn't matter if Sally Hotcrotch at the office has her tits hanging out on casual Friday and tries to sing him ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President."" All that matters is you trust him, you believe in him and the ""US"" you're trying to develop. Everything else becomes so much background radiation. 

The world can be a fucked up place. There are a lot of fucked up people in it. You can't change that except by not being fucked up yourself, which will mean there's one less douchebag in the world. That's literally all you can do. Worrying about the ratchet ass basic bitches who are gonna try to snipe your man is a waste of time. Disregard those females. Focus on your man and your relationship and trust him. 

This is an act of courage. Anytime you're afraid of something (your man banging a hobag in this case) and deal with it anyway is such an act. And you can do it. You're right to be scared and it's an act of courage because it won't always play out. Maybe you're dating a cheater and if so, it's scorpion and the frog; cheaters gon' cheat, it's just in their nature. My cousins a cheater, it's just how he is. You trust someone like that and they'll sting you in the back, mid river, just like that old scorpion, even if it means you both drown, because it's in their nature. But not everyone is like that. I'd wager, if I was a bettin' man, most people aren't like that. Probably your SO isn't like that. Most people just want to be able to hug someone and hear them say ""Everything's gonna be alright. It'll be okay, we'll figure something out."" That is to say, most people--in my experience--just want to exchange trust and have a safe place where the rest of the world can fuck right off and in that place, it's home and it's safe and it's okay. 

Sounds like you're already doing a great thing: Talking about it. Ya gotta do it openly and honestly, frequently and frankly. Talk to each other about what you're afraid of (see above) and let him reassure you (which he has) but here's the important thing: *Let him know you accept his reassurance and that you trust him.* For me at least, this is fuel. This is a Ho Proof Vest. This is Shining Armor of the Righteous because my SO has cast the magic spell ""I Believe In You, Baby,"" on me and with that I can do *anything*. I'm fuckin' Superman with the wind at his back and my Lois Lane has sent me out into he world with my chest full of pride in what we've built together and not even hos in kryptonite lipstick can phase me. 

You know what's relationship poison? Negativity, nagging, badgering, mistrust, snooping and prodding.

You know what's relationship rocket fuel? Positivity, encouragement, engagement, trust, respect (of privacy and boundaries). 

Remember when you were a kid and you'd fuck up and your parent (whichever you have fond memories of, at least I hope you have at least one) wouldn't yell and scream and bitch you out, they'd just look sad and say, ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed""? Remember how that felt? Remember how it felt when they told you ""Well done!"" or ""Good job!"" ""Way to go!"" or whatever? That's the difference I'm trying to convey here between poison and rocket fuel: The only thing you teach someone with negativity and harsh reactions and all that is to not get caught, and to not trust you, and to not rely on you when they need help. This is poison in the well. When you encourage someone and make them feel how you believe in them and know that you trust them and you both know that this trust is a big deal because you're putting your heart in their hands and saying, ""I know you won't hurt me,"" you empower them to do just that. 

Good luck, and man I hope it works out for you guys. Assuming you're good people. &gt;\_&gt;

The way to go is to find someone who got hot later. They know how to be a real human, have a sense of humor and compassion, but also are a snacc.

429,"I'd like to re-frame some stuff, and maybe introduce new ideas into your thinking here.  I see a bit of myself in you at 23, so forgive and move past anything you know is outright incorrect in my analysis.

Anyway, I find that most often, the issue lies with how you see people, and how you process certain fundamental ideas about relationships, and sex.

To keep it simple, I tell myself often that sex is about two things: fun, and connection.  The second thing I say to myself after that, is that the connection is the variable we have no control over, and the fun is.  We can't control how someone feels about us.  That means we have to accept things as they are, not as we imagine/perceive, or wish them to be.  Again, further, that means that we must accept in real-time, that the connection is deep and abiding, or casual.  You can communicate if you think it's something you should talk about, and anyone who can't is just young or immature.  Setting the record straight doesn't mean ruining a good thing.  After talks like that, I've found I am more invigorated to play within the boundaries of a casual connection.

The ""fun"" part is what we have control over to a large degree.  We can be partner-focused, people pleasers, and we can have fun with the different roles and dynamics that sex has, whether that means we're a dominant, aggressive partner one time, or a more thoughtful and purposeful lover.  We can cater to finding the maximum amount of fun everyone can have that's involved by being creative, by not forgetting to engage our partner, being grounded in the moment, etc.

As far as you catching feelings, I'd like to suggest that it's really fine.  It's not about shutting down that aspect of yourself, but more that you should realize how to process those feelings in a healthy way, and decide from that processing point whether you can handle the situation you're in.  What I mean is, you might not like hearing it, and you might disagree, but on some level, you're ""coveting"" these partners.  You're catching feelings because you view them as objects to be had, owned, obtained.  They give you status, they give you validation, they affirm your worth, and without them, you feel somehow lesser than you are.

Now, if you accept that as a premise, even just a little, a thing you can remind yourself of, is you can't control, cajole, or arrest their will and desires.  These young women aren't ""slutty"", they aren't ""easy"", they're *horny*, and they're exercising their right to sleep with whomever they find they want to sleep with.  You might not recognize a difference there, and again, you might disagree, but some part of you is confused as to how you feeling more for them than they probably feel for you fits with you having just as much right to your feelings as they have a right to sleep with whoever they want casually.

To resolve that weird and gross feeling because no one wants to ""own"" anyone else, or force someone to like or love them, just realize that it is perfectly okay to have strong feelings for someone you've been intimate with.  It really is.  I promise.  But again, just remind yourself that they aren't matching those feelings, and you have to meet them where they are.  Set aside your feelings if you can, and if you can't, if you just aren't that kind of person, that's perfectly okay.  No one was ever impressed with me at your age, sleeping around.  They called me a ""manwhore"", and it felt gross to be labeled, when in reality, I felt a lot like you did about the women I slept with.

To review my advice -- TL;DR -- **Change how you talk and think about women.  They have a right to do whatever the fuck they want, and you have an equal right to feel how you feel.  If you can't figure out how to be okay with those things in sync with one another, just stop sleeping casually with people.  You aren't that kind of person, in that case, and that's okay.  It would be pure immaturity to do something just because you can.  And then the other thing is, change how you view sex altogether.  It's not always this display of intimacy, the two baselines I go with are ""fun"" and ""connection"".  This allows me to broadly define sex, give it two essential parts, and then apply those two generalized concepts more specifically to each partner I have.  Fun means everyone has fun.  If that means you have to ask questions before, during, or after on how you can help her have more fun, that's what that requires.  But everyone has fun.  Connection can mean casual or deep.  Just figure out what it is in that situation, and live with it or don't.**

As to your last question, each person is different.  It doesn't sound like you're the kind of person who just magically doesn't have feelings anymore for someone.  You move on, sure.  But just hoping that feelings go away over time is a sure-fire way to loop yourself into feeling deeper and deeper about people that don't feel that way toward you, necessarily."

If you've talked about it sufficiently then she's gonna know it's coming, so trying to be super sneaky and get her ring size is kind of unnecessary since she knows it's coming anyways. The details of the proposal can still be a surprise, but the proposal itself shouldn't be. "

It's another one of those moderation things where there's some unspoken balance. 

When I see this shit I assume that the girl is aiming to attract some attention from guys, but I don't find that distasteful unless it's overboard or somehow fucking annoying. 

I honestly don't even know where to put your one piece on that spectrum. The clothing itself is only like half of what makes something suggestive half the time. "

471,"One of my ex's was borderline obese. I was average with a bodybuilding frame. I hated our life together. I wanted to do outdoor activities like hiking, mountain biking, jogging or just go for a walk. We went on a vacation and I picked so many things for us to do, including a hike that would get to see some Mayan ruins that she always wanted to see. She read up on it and said it looked too hard, 5 mile hike through a trail.. She wouldn't do any of that. She was very self conscience and  I worked out daily, which she said only made it worse. On several occasions of her complaining of her looks I offered to help, teach her to exercise and to look after her eating habits. It all fell on deaf ears. It was a spiral of depression she was going through and as much as I wanted to help; you can't fix what doesn't want to be fixed. I offered to take her to doctors, psychologist, therapists, get on medication, etc. but she looked down on people who did that. Our sex life was dead, she questioned why we were together and how I could get with so much better. She was a stay at home because she was too depressed to get back to school or find a job. Eventually, I hit a breaking point. Her attitude on life was affecting me too much and I just couldn't take it. I lost some friends over the break up because she told everyone I only left her because she became obese."

The one time it really bugged me was when one of them flirted with me, smacked my butt and I told her not to touch me. She got super offended and said I must be gay (because to her all straight men want womens attention all the time).

490,"This is interesting. I think for the longest time we grow up thinking of our parents as pure and great people, they’re our first idols and bring us to where we are. 

Then we try to spread wings and they guide us, sometimes against our will, into becoming who we are. 

Then at some point there’s a falling out. It may be something they did that finally just caught your attention as “wrong,” or you just came to some realization that they’re just regular people that can be flawed. 

You loose that blind following. 

But then, I think, you gain or earn back some respect for them as individuals, or people. They are just like everyone else, they have flaws you dislike and attributes you can enjoy as well. 

They can regain that “idol” status too, it’s just all about how your perspective and understanding of them forms. 

It’s also depends on if they’re normal, or neglectful. 

So basically the progression of a normal parent from their children’s perspective can go like this; 

Care taker&gt;Idol&gt;punisher&gt;flawed&gt;person&gt;??? 

For a neglectful parent. 

“Care taker”&gt;Idol?&gt;punisher&gt;flawed&gt;despised&gt;???

I was in a similar situation in a job and the reality is rarely anything ever happens to female harassers. This girl just wore hardly enough to cover up, crawled under my desk, touched me inappropriately and sat on my lap. Multiple times, she left her panties on my desk. 20 year old me found it incredibly funny, as did my (male) boss. But in hindsight, it was incredibly bad. Had roles been reversed, I would have been fired immediately. Such is life."

496,"My undergrad was in social work. Thank God I switched out of that field.   


Social Workers are among the worst in my opinion. Many of the people I met in that program were interested in the field because of personal traumas or mental illnesses. Classes were giant therapy sessions. I grew sick of hearing personal stories whenever a concept came up. Having something happen to you does not mean that you will be effective at helping someone else going through it, especially with the stories I was hearing. The class discussions were scattered with egg shells- you cannot disagree without offending someone no matter how many scientific sources you cite.   


There's also so many discrepancies, grey area, and a lack of scientific theories in the profession.  I've had professors instruct to ""trust your gut instinct"" at work. One said that professional counselors have a 50% chance of agreeing on a mental health diagnosis (imagine if oncologists had that rate).  Looking back at it, I'm not even sure why this is a four year degree because it was a basic repetition of the same concepts with different class numbers. "
497,"I think it's the same impulse as ragging on LOTR the books for being ""genre fiction"".  There's a pretty good chunk of people with serious prejudice against sci-fi and fantasy, or anything that isn't ""literary"" (not sure what the film equivalent of that is)."

501,"Pre-meds are some of the worst classmates to have and you can tell a lot of professors can't stand them either.  Manic, hyper driven, makes working with them in labs and on group projects insufferable because they will spend hours arguing one little minor point because it might be the difference between an A and an A-.  They argue with the professors and over their grades and very rarely contribute any more to any lecture/discussion other than ""is this going to be on the exam?""

I found a lot of computer science majors to be insufferable little 2edgy4me memelords who looked down on people like me for 1) asking why they needed to have multiple laptops/computers 2) not being as tech-literate as them 3) being a Sheeple for having an iPhone and a Macbook."

I have to do all this work and if I don’t get an A, i suffer. So no, you can not vacuum at 2:30 pm. Also, wear your headphones every time I’m studying or else” 

She thought her studying should be top priority, it HAD to be done in our living space (couldn’t move anywhere, not even the study hall on our floor), and she needed to have priority for the bathroom because she didn’t have time to waste waiting on me. Once I even asked her how she intended to be a nurse if she couldn’t realize she’d have to literally wait on people at work. 

But I did know a couple nursing students who were so sweet and never mentioned it. In my experience, it’s either they’re extreme bitches or the nicest people on earth. "

I never took a psychology class but the first two years must just teach you how to judge other people if the attitudes of freshmen and sophomore psychology majors are anything to go by.

Business majors like to complain about having to study but the rest of the university really wants to know how hard a 50-question multiple-choice final exam can actually be.

Philosophy majors are psychology majors that quote philosophers like Baptists quote the Bible. And they tend to miss the point just as often.

Many students in liberal arts majors are fine people - when sober. Unfortunately that's not often.

However, the worst are the MRS degree majors. They spend most their time frequenting the student lounges, the common rooms, etc, looking for a 'quality' man. What they fail to realize is that most of the quality men are either studying or are avoiding the kind of guys that frequent the student lounges and the common rooms."

543,"Wow, so much bad advice here.

So, the biggest concern is losing the friendship by making things too awkward. Obviously just telling him you're into him is preferable since it has the lowest chance of misinterpretation, but if you come on too strong and he doesn't reciprocate, it can trash the bond you two have altogether. So here's my advice:

Ask him out on a date.

Don't ask him if he wants to hang out. Don't ask him if he wants to see a movie with you. Don't ask him if he wants to catch dinner. Ask him on a *date*. Something to the effect of, ""Hey, I was thinking, do you wanna go out on a date with me?"" Casual, to the point, difficult to misconstrue. If he waffles you can shrug and take it back, as if it was just an errant thought. If he accepts, then you've gotten the green flag.

The bonus of this is that if he's just too self-conscious to say yes immediately and you have to play it off, you've at least put the idea in his head to chew on for a while."
