I never went out with anyone I didn't already have a rapport with, and I always turned down strangers who ask me out. I will *always* turn down strangers who ask me out. I have asked out 4 of my 5 partners, and married the last one. And I already had a casual friendship with all of them and friends in common with all but one, who I met at a college job. Do you know why my numbers are so good? Because I only asked out guys I shared chemistry with and had been flirting with.

Anyone who gambles on asking out people strangers or people they haven't established a rapport with, their numbers are going to be higher because they will be turned down frequently."
