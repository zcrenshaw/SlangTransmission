0,"especially when given an answer like ""none of your business what me and my SO do in private, we dont kiss and tell!"" when i ask them if they've watched the latest episode of a fucking show. fuck off you all know exactly what i mean. you come off as a holier than thou weirdo with that mentality. how often you play monopoly with each other is something done in private, that isn't inappropriate and can be discussed in public with damn near anybody you out of proportion blowing shit starters lol. anyone asks you how often your wife gives you a blowy, i give you special permission to ro-sham-bo the perverts because THAT is what you should be telling people to mind their own business with, not what your wife normally cooks for supper. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in that context will lead to the discovery of your dick size by the people, i promise lmfao."

2cc of Test-E 400

Bigger, faster, stronger, better jawline, more hair everywhere, sex drive is 9000 (used to bang the wife 4 times a week, now its close to 3 times a day if we have the time), nuts shrank while on it but the wife didnt really notice so whatever, They go back to normal after pct. You sweat a lot more but it's weird, the levels of testosterone make it so she likes the sweat, like I get up in the morning after leaving a lake on my side and she'll roll over and rub one out with her face in it, its fucking nasty but that's her prerogative"
2,Go in the porn industry

4,You need to see a sex therapist. The damage you’ve done to your sexual circuitry is near impossible to fix without professional help.

6,"While serious belief in the old Germanic gods is laughable, I have an actual problem with atheism - especially the type that resembles fundamentalism in its zeal. And I'm not even that religiously observant."
7,"-In reality a lot of the time women have the higher sex drive and are concerned when men-

Calling bullshit on this without a source. Men have 12-15, the testosterone levels of women and unless these are female bodybuilders on gear, with few exceptions, all men are going to have exponentially higher sex drives."
8,"&gt; he told me that it’s also because he is now under so much pressure at work and because of his age that it’s not fair to compare to the past. Does this sound legit?

No, it's not, he's lying. Most guys would use sex as a stress-reliever if they got chewed out at work, not have less sex.  We crave that chemical cocktail, we need that dopamine hit so I don't have to think about our problems.  It's our modus operandi. Ok, so this is a good news/bad news situation (warning, I'm blunt af):

**Bad news**: like you said, you suspect he's not attracted to you and that's correct.  It's not because you're ugly or because he's an asshole.  It's our nature.  We seek variety.  We had this burger and it's nice, but now we want pizza.  

**Good news**: He's still with you and he says he loves you. That means at its core, the relationship is based on personality and not sex (which is short lived because again, guys sex thrive on variety, sex for us is different than women's).

**Bad news**: he lied to you about something substantial.  Big breach of trust in the relationship. 

**Good new**: yes, he should have come clean about needing variety, but he most likely lied because he cares.  He knows it would hurt your feelings if he said he's bored with sex with you because you'd take it personally (i.e ""I'm not attractive enough"" instead of ""he needs more variety to be sexually satisfied""). 

How do I know this stuff?  I'm a guy.  and old guy.  We have the same physical needs.  Most guys who are in committed long term relationships end up cheating.  It's in our nature (we need variety, we want blondes, brunettes, big tits, small tits.  It's in our DNA.  That's why the porn industry is a trillion dollar market).  Most of us will try to keep the relationship intact though because we value our spouse as a person.  We recognize the intrinsic value of the relationship and its importance to our emotional health, but we also know that our woman would be heart-broken if we told her we need to sleep with someone else to feel alive. 

I'm an extremist: I believe a relationship cannot survive in the long term if the couple isn't fully honest with each other.  No trust, no love.  I've asked older couples how they manage and they often say you need to be honest with each other about everything.  [You need to know their darkest secrets and be ok with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwBAYK66grA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=73).

One of two things is happening here: he's either masturbating furiously to porn, or he's cheating on you with someone else.  One is a potential addiction (happens a lot in this crazy age of unrestrained capitalism ruining families), and the other is an asshole being an asshole (i.e it's hopeless).

If you see a serious future with this guy, get a detective and find out if he's cheating.  A cheater is always a cheater, and you don't want to wake up 20 years from now and find out he wasn't only cheating on you in bed, but out of your life savings too.  A porn-addict is a different beast, but again, if he comes clean, your relationship will come out so much stronger if you're both hardcore honest with each other.  It would feel so much better to not have to lie about anything, right?"
9,Not at all :)
10,Call in a bomb threat?
11,I speak truth to power.
12,Announce presence by stomping as you walk behind a woman coincidentally taking the same path as you at night. If that gets tiring start running so you go ahead of her. That way she knows you’re there.
