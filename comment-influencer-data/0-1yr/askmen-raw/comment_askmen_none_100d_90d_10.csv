0,Ok thanks bro. He was active in the 90s albeit not so popular. I don't know why people keep harping on something that's so easy to look up.
1,Dutch Apple Pie
2,"The only thing I said was stupid was spending as much on a car as you would on a house, and for me it's mostly because it's financially stupid for someone in my financial position. If you're fricken rich, by all means, by a brand new car that costs as much as it would to house a small family for feed a small nation. But to me, it would be a stupid position to spend that much on a new car when I could spend the money on groceries or something.

That said, one of my dreams is to get an Airstream and trick it out completely and live in it while traveling across the country. That, to me would be justified to spend as much on, as a house, because I'd be living in it."
3,People vent about their SO? I've never done that in my life. Ouch.
4,If a man is jacked he has no one to fear
5,"A noble reddit auditor has carefully reviewed my opinions and cast judgement. The sentence? A downvote! Look upon the downvote and be afraid, peasants!"
6,"Lol I love this response. It's a complete dick thing so say, and a pretty dick thing to think, but I also happen to agree with it.

On the one hand, we gotta try to not judge others for what they choose to do with the time given to them. An important part life is finding joy wherever you can and if that means video games, then so be it. Almost everybody participates in some kind of time waster activity that is really productive (everybody here is spending time on reddit, for example), so I don't get to judge which ones of those are worthwhile and which ones aren't.

On the other hand, video games are really about as non-productive as it gets. I've never met anyone who learned something accurate and interesting from a video game that they could share with me and/or the world.  It's just completely shutting your brain off from the real world. Which again, is fine to do from time to time. But realistically, do you know anyone who games for like 1-2 hours per week? I sure don't. They to a man just sit there wasting hours every day in fucking fantasy land."
7,Taxation / IRS
8,"Watching superhero movies or “movies” as they are now known, for any reason at all."
9,"Give him a little good natured ribbing for not being allowed out without his gf. If he doesn't get the hint, just start making things a ""guys night""."
10,"&gt;I get that it’s a joke

I mean we can stop here right?"
11,"I don't think you understand, the problem is the gf/wife  being there.  Bringing more gfs and wives isn't going to make it better.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh but the girls can socialize together and the boys can still do their thing""

&amp;#x200B;

No, the women scale better in larger groups, their power will multiply."
12,In my opinion it reduces the rapist and sex offenders we have..
