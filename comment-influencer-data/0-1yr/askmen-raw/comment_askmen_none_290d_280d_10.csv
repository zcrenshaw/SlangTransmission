0,"Background: My daughter lived with me from the time she was 9. Mostly it was awesome. He mother and I had been divorced for many years before she moved in with me. I had gotten sober three years before and when she was 9 she asked to live with me, four states and 2000 miles away from her mom. We never had any negative interactions with her school or her friends parents, which was pretty great. one embarrassing thing that did happen though.
One day when she was 11 her best friends mom called me and said ""I don't mean to intrude but have you noticed that your daughter has breasts."" I was kinda shocked and told her no, not really in the habit of looking at my kids chest. She suggested that maybe just this once I should. when she got home that night I did. My first thought was Oh shit, how did I miss those. I took her to a really nice store that night to get her fitted for a bra. She was super embarrassed, but handled it with a minimum of fuss, and was happy that we went. 

such are the tribulations of being a single dad. "
1,"Man, I just try and calculate how much debt I’m in."
2,Used to like girls that arent into me. Now I like girls that are into me.
3,"Depends. Are we talking about a handjob where your partner is in the moment, seeking out your spots, and making your eyes roll up in the back of your head? Or are we talking about a handjob while she watches Ancient Aliens and takes about the bills she paid that day?"
4,i like them. I often give them to myself.  
5,"It's just a silently unspoken bias when it comes to doing things with and for my daughters. Like I'm not supposed to be there. The best example I have is Girl Scouts. Now, I'm a registered lifetime member Girl Scout and approved as a helper parent. That means I have gone through the background checks and all that. My daughter's troop is excellent, they're all super cool and we get along great. But when I took my daughter to a district wide campout last year, it was a totally different matter. My daughter asked me to go so I agreed. I was one of two dads and they stuck us in absolutely the *farthest* place they could away from the rest of the campers. It was literally 10-15 minutes walk to my daughters campsite. (The tag-along moms slept in the cabins. I didn't expect that but figured I'd at least camp outside the cabin.) The attitude from the rest of the volunteers and leaders was clearly that my presence was being tolerated, but by no means welcome. Despite kicking in and helping in the kitchen making lunch for the campers, virtually nobody acknowledged my presence or even spoke to me all day, which was ok since I was there for my girl but still, no need to vibe me out for trying to be involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar experience at birthday parties, etc., where I don't know the parents beforehand. Usually, it's moms who take the kids and while I've never been made to feel explicitly unwelcome, it's kind of clear I'm the odd-man out.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Wow. Thanks for all the kind words and support, friends! It kills me how many of you have similar stories... keep being great dads! Trust me, your kids are taking notice!"
6,Not me but my dad constantly got stopped by people when he was out with baby me and my baby sister. Doesnt help he looks nothing like us (blonde hair and white we have brown hair and are very tanned) or covered in tattoos. One time a lady tried to take us off him cause she thought he had taken us from the park and when he wasnt having any of it they called the police who then had to get my mum there to say that it really was my dad.
7,Good on that mom for recognizing the situation and reaching out with a little \*nudge\* \*nudge\*
8,"I can’t speak for everyone, but I used to imagine having sex with damn near everyone woman I ran into. Now, having grown up, I tend to have a ‘well that would probably be a good time’ thought and then that’s that, but if I actually engage someone it typically leads to ‘what if we were together’ thoughts. I guess cresting the halfway point in life changes priorities and whatnot. "
9,"Middle aged guys driving ""mid life crisis"" sports cars. They've always liked nice cars, now they have money, just let them enjoy it. They've been in the zone busting their ass putting other people first and sacrificing their own interests as professionals, husbands and fathers for like four decades. Just let them enjoy the fruits of being responsible."
10,"Relying on me for all the answers. Feels great at 20. When you're married, 30, and have kids, you don't need 100 questions about how to find a dentist. "
11,"My current strategy is to hope for a miracle.
  
It isn't working"
12,"* go slow

* change positions

* understand that it's not about PIV penetration going as fast and as hard as you can all the time

* don't worry about it, if your idea of 'lasting long' comes from watching dudes go for 30 minutes in porn, that is a completely inaccurate representation of reality

* she probably doesn't care as long as you're willing to finish the job in other ways (hands, mouth, etc), in my experience most women won't climax solely from PIV penetration anyways

edit: ya'll.  This is just based on my own personal experience.  I'm not saying this is 100% true for 100% of people.  "
13,&lt;redacted&gt;
14,Breathe.
15,One time I thought of a naked lady but then I remembered it was a sin and never did it again
16,"Common advice is to find a hobby and meet people 

I recommend cooking classes. Even if you dont have a passion for it everyone, especially young men, should know how to cook. No one will think you out of place for trying to learn 

It's a hobby that is probably female dominated too which is a plus

"
17,Party girls who really love social media and pop culture. 
18,I have an 11 year old and he worked really hard at reworking and painting his room over the weekend so I brought him out for pizza as a reward. When we were there an old man came up and started interrogating me if he was actually my son. Perhaps this is more of a young single father issue than an older one. 
19,"I work at a senior living center and I was talking to a lady about her talents, about how she loved knitting and such and she turned to me and said ""well your talent is talking to others and making them feel loved""

As someone with severe social anxiety it made me feel super good."
20,Seriously. It sounds like she handled that VERY tactfully and compassionately. 
21,"Copied from my comments history. 


“1.) Don’t go out with a loaded gun. If it’s been a while, jerk it at some point before on the day of. 

2.) If you feel like you’re getting close, stop for a second. The girl won’t mind unless she’s close to orgasm, but you’ll know if that’s the case, and in such cases, getting off at the same time is pretty neat. 

3.) Relax your taint.”"
22,"Generally speaking I'm fascinated by how, when I was 16 years old, attractive 18 year old women looked like goddesses, but now that I'm 29, anyone younger than like 23 just looks like an innocent child to me and I wouldn't be able to sexualize them even if I wanted to. I mean obviously that's what's supposed to happen, but it's still an interesting transition to go through."
23,"Are we trying to stay hard, or trying to cry?"
24,"I'll take a legitimate handjob where that's the main focus, but I'll pass on a lazy hand mashing of my junk. "
25,"That sucks.   Sorry to hear that.  Go have some drinks, but don't text or call her."
26,"I don’t think they’ve become unattractive, but they’ve just moved out of the ‘relationship material’ category,

But definitely ‘woo girls’ 

"
27,I've had women tell me that I don't understand how hard it is to be a single mom.
28,"When I go to parent-teacher interviews with my ex-wife, the teachers speak directly to my ex the vast majority of the time. 

This isn't a hardship but it is unintentionally disrespectful."
29,"Super high-energy all the time.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a couch potato.

But being with someone who is ""on"" from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed is exhausting."
30,Because it's funnier to roast them instead
31,"So last night I did something different than moping and swiping for the first time.  I went out to a singles event, which was actually very easy to find.  

I sat in a corner, drinking my rum n coke (which until last night thought was called a roman coke.  Why is it not a roman coke).

A woman, a fellow corner dweller, liked my spot, found me, we started chatting.  We kept chatting.  We kept chatting until another guy came up to chat with us.  And then the event was kind of over and there were the straggler guys still chatting with us.  Then she asked me to go dancing at another place her, so I did. We did some dancing.  Then we made out

I'm not sure how I got from A to B."
32,"Traveling alone with your young child, when you really really need to use the facilities.  You have to take the poor kid into the men’s room with you because you can’t leave her outside alone.  She has to keep her eyes closed as you take care of business, plus you don’t want her looking at the guys at the urinals and you sure as hell are watching out for any of them that might be weirdos.  Ducking stressful.  Moral of the story is, poop at home single Dads."
33,grab his ass
34,You mean they partied like it was 1999?
35,"Nice save, husband."
36,that’s extremely ridiculous. I would be furious. Who’s right is it to take you’re kid away from you and claim “you don’t look like the father i’m calling the cops!”. She deserves a fine imo. 
37,HAHAHA
38,"The idea that the only reason I'd talk to a girl is for sex etc.

The look in a girls face when you approach and they have that idea is really saddening to me "
39,"We have different concepts of  ""friend"""
40,"I'm one of the handful of straight guys in my gay men's chorus, and let me tell you, there is nothing more uplifting than getting a haircut or buying some new clothes and having a dozen men immediately point out how good it looks.

I pretty dramatically redid my haircut a few months ago and one of my friends in the chorus was practically stunned. He told me no fewer than six times at that rehearsal how good it looked. That was a huge, huge boost to my self-esteem not to mention a giant confirmation that the new haircut was a good idea.

Edit: Wow, this comment took off. Want to do something awesome for our chorus? We did a GivingTuesday fundraiser and we could still use a few more donations! [https://www.facebook.com/donate/176179886670977/](https://www.facebook.com/donate/176179886670977/?fundraiser_source=external_url) (edit 2: wow, somebody on reddit actually donated to the fundraiser! Thanks, kind stranger (whose name I actually know because they posted on the fundraiser.))

And if you're anywhere near Baltimore, we've got a concert coming up on the 15th. Check out [www.baltimoremenschorus.org](http://www.baltimoremenschorus.org) for the details!"

42,"I was joking around with my twin with my older brother and his girlfriend in the car. Just banter and whatnot; at this point I can’t remember. She laughing her ass off then turns to my brother and tells him “oh my god; they’re the funniest people I’ve ever met. I’m crying I can’t breathe”

The best part of the compliment that it wasn’t even directed to me (or my twin). She felt the need to tell someone else that. Funny thing is back then, I never really considered myself funny, so her comment made it much easier to be confident with being myself because allegedly, myself is a funny guy. "
43,"&gt;she probably doesn't care 

This is key. 

If you're not willing to do foreplay or go the extra mile afterwards for her, you're doing it wrong. Sex is only half the battle and frankly probably the less important one to her. You could last 20 minutes and have the hard on of Frankenstein. If your goal doesn't include making her orgasm, the rest doesn't really matter. "
44,If she doesn’t have the consideration to text back “I can’t make it” then she’s not worth your time. Something I learned recently  is never make someone a priority when all you are is an option to them. Have a great weekend dude! 
45, But what about big titty goth gfs?
46,:(
47,Ancient Alien Theorists Say...YES
48,"Appreciate it. No no, I’m 100% done. Save the excuses. "
49,"Underrated comment - being aware of your breathing is key. I find I can delay orgasm by taking deeper breaths, your mileage may vary."
50,Why can't I drink a delicious fruity drink with alcohol in it without being labelled gay? Those drinks are god damn amazing! 
51,"some guy screamed nice ass to me as he drove by while I walked to work.

I am also a man, This made my day."
52,"I got called a cool weird dude by my friends fiancé. I’m accepted boys, next step is getting invited to the wedding. "
53,"My brother told me I’m ugly yesterday.  Jokes on him, we are twins."
54,"Because most dudes get uncomfortable when I do so.

But my fraternity brothers are exceptions to this rule."
55,"that emo/scene/sad girl thing... fuck all that. happy women are more fun
"
56,"For some reason when I was young I had a thing for really thin braids in girls' hair, I don't know why. Think like the kind Monica has in the Barbados episode of Friends, but only having one or two instead of an entire head of them."
57,"Got another one for you.  Your kid’s school will by default list the child’s mother’s contact information in their database, no matter how much of a mess she is. Mom’s going to get all the mailings, email and phone calls unless you get your name added too."
58,My ex wife.
59,"I don't think about sex or picture them naked, I mostly fantasize for a moment about asking them on a date and it actually not being a disaster. "
60,I compliment my friends all the time. They never compliment me though *sadface*.
61,It only happens if I see them and they're attractive.
62,"I’m just imagining some overbearing mother scrambling for the phone after finding out, calling the dad and being all:

“YO, YOUR DAUGHTER’S GOT TITTIES, YOU BLIND OR SUMMAT?!

Super tactful :p"
63,"Wait, what? That doesn't make sense. Even if you look young to be the dad, you could be his brother, uncle, sports coach or mentor......? I don't understand."
64,"Assumptions and treatment from others. When people find out I am a single father, they usually assume I am the asshole that caused the divorce of my marriage. It is actually not the case. There is no sympathy from others the way that single mothers seem to be supported. 

To be clear, most single parents should be given sympathy and support. It is a hard job."
65,"If you’re trying to apologize for the actions of the woman he married and had kids with, I’d forget about it. My mother was the same way up to their divorce and it never got better afterwards. Not that yours are headed for it, just saying.

If your dad has few friends, he probably considers you one of his closest guy friends. I would try and take him out one on one, do something he loves. For my dad it’s golf but this time of year it’s hard to do. Maybe your dad likes bowling or shooting pool, or even going to a sports bar and watching a game with his son just to clear his head. At the end of the day the greatest gift his (I’m assuming) teenage son is showing the initiative to want to spend time with him, and who knows you might even learn a thing or two about your old man.

Of course all of the above is stuff your typical dad likes, so if he doesn’t fit into any of those, just take him out or go out with him and make him feel appreciated doing whatever it is that makes him happy. Good luck!

Edit: I see from your edit you’re his daughter. In that case talking to him about his interest and showing initiative in spending time with him is everything a father wants from his daughter and much much more. Hope this helped l, even if only slightly"
66,Girls who like to party and get wasted every weekend. Now I prefer a low key girl that likes to stay home and watch movies or whatever 
67,You can speak for me
68,"Where is his mother?

He lives with me. I have custody.

Why isn't he with his mother?

She's a drunk.

He should still be with his mother.

Her boyfriend hits him.

He should still be with his mother."
69,Lazy hand mashing of my junk was the name of my band in high school. 
70,"How about dads are bumbling idiots who don’t know how to raise kids?

Mostly this is perpetuated for comedy’s sake on a sitcom or commercial. Not a problem. I find that humor enjoyable because I can laugh at myself. However it has started spilling over into seriousness when nothing could be further from truth.

Edit: I think I misunderstood the OP. This is actually something that I don't like. Sorry to anyone who took this as me saying it's not a big deal. I do understand why people hate this as I do myself."
71,"31 currently and when I go to the bars I see 21 year olds and I just think ""You look like my 16 year old niece's friends."" 

My younger friends don't believe me but I've said the same thing to them, your taste will change as you get older."
72,[deleted]
73,"That does sound pretty productive, whether a relationship develops or not! Thanks"
74,"It was occasional when I was younger. Now, it's just certain women i know and it's the really fucked up shit like hand-holding. I've learned to live with my degeneracy. "
75,"Woman here. I think in this scenario it was ok to let her handle it, she chose not to really confront him and walk away, I might have told him off for it but she made her choice. Not everyone woman wants a scene or wants some guy to jump in and defend her honor (though some would love that), Though in the same vein sometimes they will be too uncomfortable to speak up in which case someone else stepping in would be awesome. Sometimes it’s just better to let her handle it, you really need to read the situation and give her a chance to respond. HOWEVER, that being said, it is never a bad idea to continue to keep an eye on the situation after she attempts to handle it. Sometimes it’s not that smooth of a solution, sometimes the guy persists, sometimes they get mad, sometimes they follow the girls, sometimes it doesn’t end there and she gets hurt. If you see something like this go down feel free to let her handle it but definitely keep and eye out because if it escalates  your support can really make a difference"
76,"It can actually be a very intimate moment. 
Once a friend was giving me one, while I was caressing her (both of us naked), and we had a really nice conversation and she told me she never had such an intimate and wholesome experience. 

Honestly, we felt like new people after."
77,"Goth is an aesthetic, being a fucking downer is a character flaw. "
78,"Haven't seen this yet and it's a big one. I have no fucking clue how to do my daughter's hair. I've had advice from female friends, my female hair dresser, the Internet, but my daughter's hair permanently looks like she was dragged through a haystack. (Her mom is no longer in the picture, she spends 100% of the time with me).

I've taken her to my hair dresser, she fixed my daughter's hair so it looked beautiful. I took notes, photos, bought the same equipment and products. Two days later her hair was a fucking bird's nest again. 

I worried at first that people would think I was negligent, now I don't really give a fuck because I know I'm a great dad. "
79,"It’s been mentioned but strangers saying things like “oh is it daddy daughter day” or “giving mom a break today” are tough in our situation (mom is deceased). I handle it fine but my little lady still gets upset more often than not.  Can’t blame the strangers though they don’t know. 

Edit: thanks for all the kind words everyone, I appreciate and it’s nice to know there’s a lot of kind folks out there!

And thanks for the silver!"
80,"One time, when I was around 12 or 13, an old Mexican neighbour lady said I could become a male model. That shit made my month. "
81,"If the woman is attractive, basically 100% of the time.

If you're an attractive woman and you go out in public, I can pretty much guarantee you that at least a few dozen guys think about having sex with you."
82,"In general I just put my body between the two and ""accidentally"" block the bloke."
83,They don’t understand how hard it is like to be a single father either. So there’s that.
84,"Idk if my input counts but here we go, son of a single father here, now in my twenties. The court deemed my mother unfit for raising me a year after granting her 100% custody. My dad took me right away no questions asked from me about my mother. 

While I was growing up my father had a hard time playing the nurturer role. To make up for it he was tough on me and instilled lots of life lessons and tools to get me through growing up like personal finances, credits, etiquette/manners, how a man should hold himself and stand his ground, job interviews, discipline, etc. 

As I was growing up I saw the look from teachers, friends, other parents give a weird look when I told them I have no mother. So right away I knew that being a single father, my dad had a stigma and unfair presumptions that came with being a single dad. So I have to say being the product of a single dad, men don’t get enough recognition for being single and taking care of their kids. As i grew older noticed how isolating it must have been because mothers have support groups and one another and such but I don’t hear much of anything about single father support groups and such. So I knew it must have been hard on my dad and my dad would not take a single cent from my mother. Plus I was often harassed by my school administrators if he is/has ever been verbally abusive, an alcoholic, child beater, and is “there” for me. I thought that constant yearly eval was such bs growing up.

My dad may not have been as nurturing or sensitive but he taught me how to be a man and always made sure I was taken cared of (feed, clothe, regular doctors visit). Friends would often ask me was it hard growing up without a mother and Idk what that even means or how to answer it? "
85,"My wife's family were kind of overly supportive and answered EVERY little question she ever had which never really made her think critically at home. When we met she had very little DIY skills, and it took a looooong time and a lot of frustrating conversations between us where I would go ""babe...please just think about this for a second before asking me"" before we made progress in that area "
86,"I took a girl I was seeing to a hockey game and she later mentioned that I came across as ""jockey"" there.

Like, what am I expected to do? Sit politely and golf clap when Lundqvist makes a great save? I'm here to cheer on my team, and the whole fun of going to a game is getting into it with the rest of the crowd.

Basically the idea that it's somehow uncouth to enjoy sports and actually get excited when watching them.

Edit: Since the ""why would I bring her"" question keeps popping up, 2 things: She asked because she had never been to a game before, and we had been seeing each other long enough that I wanted to share my interests with her."
87,"Hell yeah, touch my dick. I'm not gonna complain. "
88,"I don't know about performing better but my boyfriend said he hums the Pokemon theme song to distract himself.

Also said he thought of ""Togepi's retarded face"" when looking at me and apparently it's highly effective. 

Mixed feelings about this one."

90,"For context, I have a fitness Instagram

Some guy who followed it (I didn’t know him at the time) came up to me and said “dude, I follow your Instagram. You’re an inspiration”. I told him I appreciated the kind words and he followed up with “no  I’m serious; I see how much work you put in. You’ve inspired me to go back to the gym, keep up the good work”. 

All of that from a stranger I didn’t know existed two minutes prior. "
91,"You're going to get a lot of advice strictly about performance, but don't forget to enjoy sex. It's supposed to be the fun part. Never get to that point where sex becomes clinical. 

Be present. Take the time to explore each other. Give and receive. Feed off of their vibe and connect on a deeper level. Be vocal and express your pleasure - moaning, dirty talk. Allow yourself the freedom to be vulnerable and get lost in a moment. Don't forget it's okay to laugh a little, too. 

If all you ever do is focus on lasting longer and performance, then you're going to miss the forest for the trees. "
92,Assert dominance 
93,"A girl said she really liked my hair. Pretty sure that's the only compliment I've been given in the last 5 years. It happened like 2 months ago and I'm still riding the high, to be honest. "
94,"Exactly. Do you really think a guy can drive out of college in a sports car? No, you probably won’t be able to afford one until at least 40, to which people automatically assume your going through a mid life crisis and are too old to be driving that kind of car"
95,"Girls who want me less than I want them. The sex was never worth it in the long-run. Now if a girl isn't super into me, I can't be be bothered to put in the effort I used to make up for that. It just seems sad even if I'm successful in the end. Life isn't a romance movie."
96,"Where I live is a very middle class area where most people think they are right and dont care if they are proven wrong, like one time when I was in primary school everyone thought my mum was a nanny cause she is dark brown, and when they found out she wasnt instead of saying sorry they basically said how where we supposed to know, they dont look like you.

97,"Last night I joked to my roommate that I’ve been “coasting on my good looks” and he goes up to a girl at the bar and says “my roommate says he’s been coasting on his good looks” and she goes “yeah he’s right” and we proceed to talk for the next hour. 

Never felt that good before. "
98,"I contact them on LinkedIn saying that I have a job opportunity for them as a wife and mother.

I was a stay at home dad getting an engineering degree who made 1800 a month from the GI bill.

Which was more than my ex was making working full time.

People always praised her for supporting the family and I got dirty looks."
100,"""He must be overcompensating for something""

Most guys I've met think sports cars are pretty cool, but if you buy one you must have a small penis.  Oh, you drive a large pick-up truck?  It can't be because you actually need the bed for work, you must have a small penis.  Oh, you work out a lot?  Small penis.

I don't know about the rest of the guys here, but the size of my penis has never factored into a single decision I've made about buying anything other than underpants.

EDIT: It turns out that a LOT of people in this thread think only people with small penises own lifted trucks or drive aggressively."

103,"I have my own story similar to this.

My dad went to pick me up from my girl scout day camp, since my mom couldn't that day. They wouldn't let me go with him.

He tried to call over our scout leader, who's daughter was also attending the camp. This woman knew that he was my dad, and she ignored him. 

I did get picked up eventually.

On the other hand, I attended a father daughter girl scout camp, and they were great. It's one if my fondest memories."

113,"It seems things just fall into my lap here and there, regardless of how hard I try, so I'm just kind of living life and trying to be outgoing without really trying to get anything else. "
114,Penis size not a factor in decision making process? Small penis.
115,"Not so much sex but more things like cuddling on a couch or going on vacation and decorating the house with Christmas stuff.

God I'm lonely.  


Edit.  
Thanks for the kind words everyone and also thanks for all the upvotes!"
116,"For me, it's straight male ""banter"" and roasting between friends. I constantly hear from girls how it's obnoxious, mean and a part of toxic masculinity. From my experience, and from the experience of almost all men I've spoken to, it's almost the primary way that men bond, you roast those that you are fond of.

I've also noticed a double standard with it. I've gotten into watching RuPauls Drag Race through my GF (love me some guilty pleasure reality TV), and ""reading"" is a huge part of it, which is basically the Drag Queen version of roasting. The same girls who criticise straight men for banter are the ones going ""yasss kween"" whenever a drag queen gives out a harsh comment."
117,"Getting a nice car -&gt; midlife crisis or compensating for something

The general theme of jumping to the conclusion men do something to compensate or out of insecurity bugs me."

Wait. I'll figure it out."

I've been out of trouble and living on my own working to pay rent since I was 19, I've had quite a few positive interactions with the newer officers but all the old times still think I'm scum. 

Last week one of the old timers approached me at the bar and apologized for his coworkers unprofessionalism (sometimes they get drunk and fuck with me while I'm working), he said he cant believe how far I've come over the last ten years.

* ""No it wasn't hard for me."" 
* ""This is all I've known, so I have nothing to compare it to.""
* ""Was it hard growing up with a mother?""
* ""The worst part is when people assume life without a mother is terrible or that I'm missing out on something. My dad did an awesome job raising me.""
* ""Did your mother teach you it was acceptable to ask intrusive personal questions?"""

131,Watches are a male stereotype?
132,"Generally, people think that as a father you are somehow less of a parent than a mother.

This wouldn't seem like a massive deal, the problems start when you leave an abusive woman, and it becomes difficult to stop her from abusing your kids. 
Teachers will tell the mother everything a parent needs to know about your kids progress/needs, and assume she'll pass on the news to you. If she's an abusive woman she will keep you out of the loop or maybe even turn the kids against you. She might try and medicate your kids or have them diagnosed with behavioural disorders instead of properly parenting them, keeping you in the dark at all times. There is almost nothing you can do about this, the consensus among those who should know is that mothers are better parents than fathers.

If you try and make sure doctors and teachers keep you in the loop they often won't bother, you are, after all, only the father.

In my personal experience, even taking an abusive woman to court is an exercise in futility. The judge might acknowledge she was abusive, that she had done things to you, that had the genders been swapped, would make it difficult for the father to even see the kids. The Judge might even acknowledge the mother's behaviour towards the kids is disturbing, and then award her custody anyway because ""kids are better off with mum"".

To summarize - if your ex is abusive it's difficult to protect your kids because of preconceived notions about men and fathers. Hopefully this didn't come across as too bitter."

A few instances I can think of were:
*  I was put in a cabin by myself (which was mostly fine really, just stood out to me when I believe a ftm transgendered person stayed with others.). 
* I was not allowed in the common area with the other workers since they were all female.
* There was an issue I was trying to fix with my pay so I went to my cabin. The girls were there in their bathing suits for some reason and I was told I couldn't be there.
* At the end of the whole thing, everyone was given a shirt with their camp nick name on it. Every staff member, even my Co worker, was on there except for me and I was not given a shirt.

At each of my schools, I was the only little girl being raised solo by my dad, but there were plenty of solo mums!! 

ALL my friend’s single mums aggressively hit on my dad. It made him SUPER uncomfortable to the point he stopped coming to parent teacher conferences, or anything school related. My friend’s mums would even just “drop by” my house to “say hello to me” but really try to see dad. 
It was messed up and made me and my friends (single Mum daughters) super uncomfortable.

Might sound like a trivial complaint, but it really affected me, and dad’s involvement  at anything where mums were gonna be. 

He would say “I can’t drop you at Nicole’s house anymore, her Mum groped me” or Can I drop you outside the birthday party? Sam’s Mum keeps msging me and won’t stop”. My friends would even pull me aside and say “is your dad interested in my Mum?” 

Dad never dated or even entertained the idea of dating a friend’s mum. After he left my mother, he was dating girls half his age and loving life.

 Positions can be tricky, but you need to figure out what positions you like or hate or work best for having an orgasm. This can vary women to women or man to man. I personally HATE women on top. If she likes it, fine, but I often struggle to maintain an erection in that position. With my first GF in college I struggled with standing doggy for a bit to not cum, so guess what?

The thing is that as you get older you find out that no one is perfect physically.  Find someone that will make you laugh and love them.   Will you be rejected by some people, absolutely they are the jerks that you did not want to date anyway.

There's no real advice. Get out there, meets lots of people. Check for how ""deep"" your connection with someone could go. Spend time. Open up, gradually. Have sex. Talk about plans.

Once you reach a certain point, you'll know whether you prefer to be with this person and add some commitment to that ""connection"", or not. If both sides feel the same... voila! You have a relationship on your hands!"

My dad turned it into a game. We called it spies. 

So before we'd go in he'd tell me he had a top secret mission for me and needed to be briefed in a secret location so he'd have to blind fold me. When we got into the cubicle he'd tell me that my secret mission was to catch a run away spy that looked just like him and I needed to change into my spy gear (swimming costume) to catch him. Then once changed he'd need to blindfold me again to take me to the mission. 

Once we got poolside he'd quickly take his hands off my eyes and jump in. And then I'd jump in after him and swim after him and ""Chase him""

214,"Practice edging while masturbating.  

If you think of your sexual arousal level as a number from 1 to 10 (with 1 being totally soft and 10 reaching orgasm) first learn to recognize where roughly on the scale you are while jerking off.  
Then practice keeping your arousal level at a chosen point. First try with 5. If you feel like you're getting too aroused, slow down, breathe slower, focus on something else, whatever works best for you.  
When you feel like you can easily stay at 5, try the same thing with 7. Then with 9.  

Once you can maintain your arousal level at just below cumming for longer periods of time while masturbating it will be a whole lot easier to do the same during actual sex, especially in positions where you're the one setting the pace.

Couldn’t really sleep, couldn’t really eat, barely made it through thanksgiving dinner without sobbing into my plate. It’s been the worst pain I’ve ever experienced (first real relationship, ended over long-term compatibility issues).

Last night her and I set up a time to talk remotely about taking care of the last few logistical things with ending the relationship before we break off contact. I don’t know if it was hearing from her, or taking control of the situation, or me just having enough with the constant pain. Whatever it was, I was actually able to enjoy a night with a buddy and got a full night of rest. So that was good.

Otherwise, Thanksgiving was a mess due to family bickering and the breakup has been the capstone to a horrible year. But I’m gonna take the next year and do something to make myself better. Because I’m sick of letting life kick me around.

He had one earbud in listening to music before rehearsal started one evening, and I was sitting fairly near him. Another random cast mate said ""godspeed"" to someone for whatever reason, and I kind of muttered to myself ""Godspeed! You Black Emperor"". A name of a band.

The dude looked over at me, then turned his phone my direction. He was listening to a song by that band. We laughed and immediately bonded, and we've been best friends for over 6 years now. Our girlfriends are best friends. We all had Thanksgiving together this year. Best bro moment led to having my best bro."

263,"The only two hardships I can think of over 18 years of raising my daughter nearly single handedly from babyhood to happy healthy adulthood was the time some middle aged hag yelled, ""Zip up her coat"" at me one brisk fall day we were out walking  
and that everyone seemed to think I was looking for a new mother for her when all I wanted to do was get laid like any other healthy guy in his 20s.  
A bit of child support would have been nice but you can't get blood from a turnip."

266,Most men's rooms don't have baby changing tables. Also everyone assumes that I'm married and that's annoying.
267,“Like yeah I’ll look” Epic.
268,"Yes,

1.  because you can't trust ppl

2.  because all birth control has a failure rate so doubling up makes it virtually impossible for conception to occur

3. I hate condoms"
269,"Seconded.  I'm a dad with several hobbies that I wish I had more time for, and 2 kids who are too young to really participate in said hobbies yet, but in a few more years I think it would absolutely make my day for them to ask if they can take me out to spend some time on one of my interests for my birthday.  That's about the nicest birthday present I can imagine one of them getting me.

EDIT: I also really second the part about not taking it on yourself to apologize for the woman he married.  It's not your fault and it's not your job.  Defend him maybe, but otherwise just focus on being nice to him yourself.  You're the only person whose actions you control."
270,"I feel so called out by this comment.

Still baffles me how she thought it was ok to ask, but not be asked lol. "

282,"What? I compliment other guys and get compliments from other guys (while none of us are gay).

Recently I've been working on my skin (it tried to eat itself, so yeah, I changed my diet and things). After a few weeks I started getting compliments from guys I know about how nice my skin was looking. They're not gay as far as I know and neither am I.

My wife said, 'Get what?' 

Those... her... boobs! When did that happen???

298,"Hey there. Over-50 female here. You have a plenty of allies in my age group, by now we all know that sometimes moms aren't the right parent, and dads need just as much support and approval when they end up having to go it alone. 

PLEASE don't hesitate to ask a woman to ""guard the door"" for you while you help your daughter use the ladies room. There's NOTHING wrong with a young girl in the stall, a dad helping either inside the stall (leave the door cracked just a little bit if you're worried about pedo accusations) or hanging right on the other side coaching, and a third woman at the main door letting incoming women know the bathroom's currently coed. 

I watched a young dad do this during intermission at a big crowded event; daughter wanted to ""go all by herself"" but needed some guidance -- when he called over the top ""Did you go poopy? Don't forget to wipe front to back!"" we gave him a round of applause. 

God, this is why we need more nice big multi-use family/gender neutral/handicapped accessible bathrooms.

""Aye, I see you bruh!""

""That's a dope fit.""

""Fresh ass haircut.""

""Shoe game on point.""

But that's what we do. We're confident/comfortable enough to make subtle compliments in a joking matter to not make people make assumptions about us. "
318,"I got this when I was babysitting my brother and cousins. 

Lady thought I was a pedo, one of my cousins screamed at her for screaming at me. 8 year old logic is the best."
319,"Drama.

As a young man, I was subconsciously drawn to women who created conflict and disruption.

Only after several exhausting relationships did I stop and ask myself why all the women I ended up with started out seeming nice, then soon revealed themselves to be disruptive, demanding, and often manipulative. Of course, my choices were the common denominator. I kept mistaking ""selfish"" for strong and ""troubled"" for interesting.

I took some time off dating. Got my head in order and the next woman I dated was not like that at all. For the first time, I had a fun relationship with someone who didn't spend all my money, put me down constantly, talk about herself the whole time, create a scene every time she wasn't the center of attention... you get the picture.

Now I can spot the kind of woman I used to be attracted to coming a mile off and I'll walk another mile to avoid her."

325,Honestly i think this applies for more than girl scouts . I worked for a company that had all women line leads and I was the only male one for a while. I came from a much bigger company and was used to watching over 100 employees daily. This was usually 7-10. Every day I watched the women goofing off and never following any of the rules. Sometimes they would sit around the computer and literally hold hands like high school kids. For 3 months one of the female supervisors tried to give me a verbal warning and every time I managed to correct her . It felt like such a girls club and eventually I had enough and went to my supervisor and basically demanded to be moved to another department . They never once would say good morning or ask anything to me. Within 3 weeks I had all my cost prices lower than everyone of them by almost double. Yet they still never asked me for help .
326,"Even then they still do the same shit. They'll keep you on for a couple, then ""forget""."

330,"The fact that you're thinking about your dad and want to make him feel good is lovely. I think if he knew that, that might well be a huge gift in itself.

That said, it's not your job to apologize for your mother's behavior. What she does is not your fault. You have nothing to feel bad about, quite the reverse. If you reference your mother's behavior, your dad may feel as if he has to defend his wife, which will put up a barrier between him and you. And he may also feel bad that he hasn't been able to protect you from seeing what is happening between him and your mother, which will also put a dampner on things.

If you can, take him out for a walk; just you and him. Ask him how things are just now, how he's feeling, what his life is like, what's on his mind. At an appropriate point, tell him you love him and you appreciate all the things he has done and still does for you. If you can think of one, give him an example of  something from your early childhood that he did for you and that is a memory you still treasure today.

Often, when you're a dad, a parent, you pour love and attention into your children for years. You don't do it to be thanked. But you do sometimes wonder how much your kids notice all the things you do for them and how much you love them.

When kids get older, all of this is background of love and care is masked by the normal and completely understandable conflicts that parents and teens have with each other. But that just makes ""thank you"" and ""I love you"" even more unexpected and powerful.

And, like /u/Candorio says, if your walk takes you past one, you could always pop into a pub and have a beer with him, if that's his thing.

Good luck. I hope you and your dad manage to salvage something of the day."

He had walking sticks with him but I dont have a heart to leave him just like that. 

so got weird looks from dudes since i was waiting by the gents. One time, a dude gimme the look of WTH and I asked him to help my grandad in the loo. Then, he then realised i am not a pervert and gave me the nod thus helped. So, you’re not alone ;)"

361,"I've had my daughter on my own since she was 7 months old.

The first issue, like some folks already brought up, was finding bathrooms with changing tables.  Now that she's almost 5 years old, she can use the bathroom by herself mostly, but for a solid year there it was this awkward dance of either trying to get her in a men's room when it was empty, or waiting outside the women's room while she did her business.  The problem is, she would sometimes get stuck, and I couldn't really go in and help.  So I would usually either ask a woman on her way in to check on her or to cover the door for me while I cleaned her up and got her out of there.  I would never ask white women (I'm white, for the record) because they would usually be the ones to give dirty looks or talk to a manager or whatever.

Second big one for me is that it seems like as a man, my by boss can't seem to grasp that after 5pm, I'm done working.  I'll answer phone calls and respond to emails, but 6pm-10pm is my time with my daughter.  I don't give a shit how many reports are backlogged or how many times a client called you asking for something.  You have me from 6am-6pm, after that, if you expect anything else you will be disappointed.  Meanwhile, my female coworkers leave early every day to go pick up their kids and they never hear a word about it.

Another big issue is just the constant alienated feeling.  Every kids function I go to, I'm usually the only dad there, especially at Gymnastics class.  I'm not very extroverted, so it sucks sitting there feeling the sideways glances.

Also my ex, who lost all custody due to severe drug issues that led to the courts only allowing her supervised visitation every other weekend, is constantly threatening to take me back to court.  And it's terrifying because the courts are so slanted against men that there's not even the illusion of fairness.

Which brings me to the last point, in that I'm essentially trapped in my home state.  I can't just take a job anywhere and pack up and leave, I have to stay right where I am.  I feel trapped here, working a job I hate, and all my goals and ambitions are essentially dead in the water.  There's no way the state would let me take my daughter too far from her mother, nor do I have another $13k to spend on legal fees to do so.

But, it's all worth it for [little moments like these.](https://youtu.be/6W4T8bubJr8)"
362,Serious question. What do girls think guys like about boobs? Because for me and I assume the rest of guys it’s everything. Looking at them. Fondling them. Whatever.

He and I turned from her and met eyes quite by accident. We both smiled, nodded, and went about our day.


Another time, my SO and I were at a gas station, and she walked in ahead of me.

A guy outside looked at her, made eye contact with me, and then subtly raised his eyebrows while briefly glancing at her as if to say, “You with her?”

I smiled and gave him a head-up, as if to say, “Yup! She’s fucking gorgeous, right?!”

And he just nodded to me and smiled.

The beet bro moments involve a beautiful woman and no words."
410,damn gottem 
411,Wow that hit close to home
412,Because I was young and thought they were fun and really good looking. 
413,You should never let your attacker move you to a different location. It might be alright with corner-dwellers; I'm not sure.
414,"Absolutely --it sucks that OP didn't have a good mother figure but I am noticing with each of his examples there's an unnecessary attribution to the gender as opposed to the individual. The childhood friend: the falling out was shitty, but plenty of people change for the worse during puberty. The crush: She sucks, but sounds like there were a larger number of guys that were shitty to him as well. High school: If OP didn't have many friends in general, I am gonna guess both guys and girls may not have cared. Also, lots of people don't have a relationship in high school and it doesn't mean it's because members of the opposite sex are all bad. 

OP, you're right about the mindset. Don't let prejudices become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Also, this may go without saying but because I noticed the focus on dating/relationships at the end --don't interact with every woman with the thought of chasing a relationship. You will likely only be more frustrated if they can't give what you want even if they are a good person."
415,"The attendant at my gym told me ""I've really been rockin it in there"""
416,"For my entire youth, I was told girls are better at communicating, more mature, and less violent. 

Based on my relationships at work, in friend circles, and at home, all of that turned out to be a disgusting lie. "

418,"I came to this thread out of pure curiosity. Now I have absolutely no self esteem. 

I’m a skinny, punk (ish?) chick with piercings, no tits and dyed hair. Not to mention my height was already a turn off (6’1). 

At least I have a sense of humour?




I am going to die alone aren’t I?"
419,"It does have that stigma, but you just gotta learn not to give a shit. I was wearing them most days this summer."
420,"Yep. When my older sister was 28 and married with 2 kids (I was like 16 at the time), I always looked to her like she was a well-adapted adult and had her shit together...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 34, and I view 28 year old girls as...well....basically 22. It's weird. I'm way older than I used to picture an ""adult"", but at the same time I have the energy and optimism and excitement of a 21 year old and probably always will.

&amp;#x200B;

Just makes me wonder what my 16 year old self would have thought of my 34 year old self...if I had had the slightest clue I was bound to endure the shit I did, go the places I did, do the things I've done...

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't have believed it."
421,"Most recent were both this week. My gym mate came up to me and said ""Bro. I shouldn't be telling you this but you were chunky when you came back to the gym. You've lost a lot of weight"". The other was from this dude who's leg extension I accidentally took cuz I thought the machine was open (he was doing a circuit and asked if he could jump in when he had to do quads). He looked at me and said ""Why are you training legs? You got some fucking tree trunks""."
422,"Also nurse, in my younger years... I must admit I was a woo girl but with age I'm all woo-ed out. "
423,"Girls acting dumb to be cute. 

It’s not cute anymore. "
424,"Once I said no after being woken up by 3am, and she sulked the entire day going ""[Ex's name] would have sex with me when I wanted it!""

Yeah that relationship did not work out"
425,"That different girls need different things to get going. First girl I dated was very sexual and loved having her nips played with lightly. Second girlfriend, kinda gave me this look and said ""you know that's not doing anything for me"" and I kinda just died inside. We figured it out, it just felt like learning sex all over again. "
426,ONE YEAR AND YOU’VE GOTTEN A SINGLE LAUGH OUT OF REDDIT SMH 
427,"&gt; Masturbate earlier in the day....

AKA tactical wank "
428,"Unfortunately I married this type of girl. I was 26, she was 28. I was a handsome man with a good job. I enjoyed traveling and adventure sports. I would say that I was half way between an extrovert and computer nerd. She was a socialite with a following. She was hot, extremely good with people, and incredibly fun to be around. I thought she fell for me, but really I fell for her. We visited over 60 countries, I taught her how to surf and snowboard, and she took me to some of the most amazing events I have ever been to. 

I thought that we could settle down after marriage, but she wanted to keep the party lifestyle going. I wanted kids, she led me on for years. All the signs were there, but I was absolutely mesmerized by her. She didn’t want to give up her individual identity at all.  I thought of us, she thought of herself. In all fairness she wanted me to do the same thing, but I couldn’t do it that way.

All I can say is that relationships can be drastically different once real life hits. Some people aren’t equipped to move onto family life even if they indicate that they want to. I’m not sure if social media obsession was the start of the downfall, but it definitely contributed. 

**While social media is supposed to connect us, the instagram model persona is making us evermore individualistic and isolated.**

EDIT: to answer DMs. No, I don’t have kids and I’m still in my early 30s. I had an absolute blast with her, but I should have realized it would never translate to a happy family life. Don’t rush into marriage and make sure you are on the same page before you tie the knot. **GET a prenuptial and setup isolated trusts with a proper estate lawyer!**"
429,Perfume/cologne. Used to think it was super sexy. Now I can’t stand it. Probably because pple still put on the same amount as when they were twenty &amp; have no idea how intrusive it is

431,"I sued for custody and I was told by my attorney that I was going to lose unless I proved her unfit. I provided documentation and provided proof of her history of abusing me and our son, alcohol abuse, mental instability, job and home instability, spouse abuse, perjury in court, tax evasion, and still lost because the child deserves to be with his mother.

437,Always hated it. Started hating it really hard as I got older.
438,"I noticed a theme that a lot of men initially attracted to fit/thin girls, are now in later years more attracted to curvey girls. Why is this?"
439,"Hmm does Reddit count if you post a picture?   

If not in person I guess it was when a lady told me I had nice dimples.  This was years ago.

There should be a loot box version of compliments for men.  For 10 bucks a month some lady shows up at your door and says "" hey nice arms!"" Or something "
440,"OP--what would your advice be to a woman who had a negative view of men because of her experiences with her father and other males growing up? At the end of the day, we have to prevent singular experiences from assuming that entire classes of people are going to be the same way. "

448,Lana is one of the most tragic stories you can learn about.  Not just because of her transformation but there's actually evidence of when she was asking how to become a movie star.  She was young af on yahoo questions asking if she's pretty enough to make it in Hollywood or some shit. 
449,So wholesome. I love it 
450,"You’re not a REAL MAN until you chew burning fucking coals, anything less is a shame "
451,A woman being attracted to the man and being open and clear about it.
452,"As a dude, I kinda know what you mean? The other day some chick in a restaurant looked me up and down from head to toe. She wasn't bad at all, but in that moment I just felt... uncomfortable and violated haha.  
  
Also...  
  
&gt;  The cashier literally grabbed my arm and said, “Take me with you!”  
  
That's fucking weird. You should have said, ""No, you're not coming!"""
453,"Right there with you, brother. My daughter went off on one lady for this crap, it was great."
454,"Goth chicks. I was really into them back in high school in the 90s, but all the sad sack drama got old. ... Emotional stability in a partner took priority around when I turned 25 and after several loony girlfriends."
455,"Make noise. I've been told by all of my partner's that I perform very well, and when I ask, the number one thing they say is that I make noise. I grunt and growl and moan, letting her know anytime something feels good and what I enjoy. Don't be afraid to tell them what you enjoy, things like ""oh fuck yeah, just like that. If you keep doing that I'm gonna fucking cum."" The other advice I can give, is to caress rather than grab/grope. Instead of just grabbing her tits, start at her shoulder and slide your hand around her arm up to her tit, then give it a good hard squeeze, then suck her nipple right after. Give it a little (GENTLE!) tweak, and then kiss her deeply. 

When you're inexperienced, don't try to ""fuck her brains out"". Try to be as sensual as possible, and share the pleasure with her. 


Good luck, future cocksmith!"
456,"Sad? Just “man up”. Guys aren’t allowed to feel things and that makes girls angry, like they don’t want us to just be robots. Then get called pussies for showing emotions or “not a real man”. Can’t win."

458,"I cannot share my goals, dreams, and fears with a pair or a single breast.

“Start over.”"
474,"Wait, you mean babysitting while you give Mom a break. Because we all know she's the only real parent. /s 

I've had people praise my husband for simply holding our daughter. My husband is an awesome  Dad, but holding his own kid isn't the reason."
475,is this the one where you venmo me $5 every time you have a dirty thought?
476,"Ignore the other asshole who replied to you. It sounds like you are being a great father and that's all that matters now. 
"
477,This is pretty much how I think as well. I mean who doesnt imagine having sex with every girl you meet when you were a horny teenager. Now that I'm approaching my mid 20s and never been in a relationship I more fantasize about the opportunities I pass and think about what could of happened. Is this the person that I could of potentially spent the rest of my life with? What trips could I potentially gone on with them? A lot of the time it doesnt even need to be anything romantic. Could this person be my best friend in the future ect ect.  
478,"Close. You donate a predetermined amount based on how grave your sin was. Did you lie? That will be $10. Did you commit incest? That will be $600,000."
479,"Masturbate earlier in the day....

Slow down - use foreplay to calm yourself and make sure she’s getting pleasure

Focus on her - when she’s spent them let yourself go..."
480,"I want to add, do it without porn though.  "
481,I love a girl in uniform. Like one you know from looking at them. They look beautiful in some terrible clothes and you just know.
482,"I was looking for this option, which OP didn't mention. Also when something like that happens it's nice to have someone be like ""hey, that was pretty ducked up of him"". Even if it ends at that, at least she'll know she's not alone in the situation. And like you said, someone in your corner."
483,Fuck the bedroom. Spontaneous blow job in the kitchen

485,i feel personally attacked
486,"&gt;Now I eat ass like a Chinese tourist at a crab leg buffet.

That's... pretty descriptive lmao. "
487,"IMO, the more you pursue a relationship the more unlikely you’ll be to find one that’s right for you. 

Aim for female friends (if you haven’t got many already), maybe get onto a dating app to try out some conversation starters and maybe arrange some dates, but don’t be desperate to find a relationship as it’ll show. 

When it’s right it’ll happen, play it cool brother! "
488,"As a woman who has been in both situations (I wanted to handle it and I have also wanted help), I think the only thing I would add is to go ask her if she is OK. There have been a few times something happened to me and men who knew me well said nothing. I got that they had faith I could handle myself, but it kind of hurt when they said absolutely nothing and just moved on like it didn't happen. Especially on some occasions when I felt as blind-sided as they did and could have used some back-up in the form of just validating that it happened and they saw it and didn't think it was OK. When someone does that after I have a bad experience with bullying from men or women (sexual and non sexual), it always helps. But everyone is different, so take my advice with a grain of salt. "
489,Ultimately I got her number but he shot his shot. I was completely joking too and it just so happened that last night was good for me. 
490,"Just mirror whatever she does. If she's a softer, slower kisser, go soft and slow, if she's going hard, you go hard. It's a dance, just follow each other. She doesn't seem to have a problem with initiating, so just follow her lead and go on a little ride together, feel it out. And enjoy it. It's fun. "
491,Pounding some poor girl's cervix for 20 minutes is not what makes you a man.
492,"OP gets fucked, for sure"
493,"I'm a high libido guy and all, but my fellow dudes with the mentality of ""see any woman = want that woman"" simply *have* to understand that's a pretty insane way to be. This kind of predatory nonsense is why women live in near-constant fear of men.

I mean, I realize that there's going to be a commenter bias here, so it makes sense that there's going to be a lot of affirmation to OP's question in this thread. I'm also not at all knocking having a healthy fantasy life. There's also definitely merit in evaluating someone as a potential partner (no matter what sex you are). All of that is understandable.

What I *am* saying is that if you're seeing about half of the world as a sexual buffet then that ain't actually healthy. Downvote me, cry white knight, or whatever if you need but I'm serious here. You're going to have trouble landing/keeping an actual girlfriend with this mindset. You're also making things way harder for the rest of us.

Just be cool and start seeing women as people. Start there, okay?"

500,"online dating has always been my go to. it has worked but nothing lasting. i'm a single dad and for some reason i've been trying to avoid dating other single parents, but i've recently decided i should just go for other single parents. also, actively trying to avoid getting too serious too quickly. 

met a really cute single mom this past week and we got lunch and hung out yesterday. fingers crossed!"

502,"People forget that you may always need that person one day. If you’re not interested, say it. Acting like someone doesn’t exist just ruins it for the next person. "
503,"Even in the boy scouts, the moms were far more celebrated that the dad's. Granted, my dad didn't do a lot with the scouts (he came to the yearly big campout though), but still. The moms were always shown so much praise: ""thank you so much for supporting your young men in this important stage in their life..."" When, for most kids, the dads did 100× more than the moms. Strange."
504,It's a defense against insecurity.
505,"Don't write something nasty to her. This happened to me once and I started to send her a text about it. Decided not to. Turns out she was in a car accident. Our next date she had a cast on her leg. I know it's unlikely, but there is a small chance she didn't show because of an emergency."
506,The wings are actually pretty useful for an active pre-teen. I was always a little annoyed when my pads didn't have wings. They really hold things in place lol
507,"I had an older woman accusatorially ask me if I was the father of my little girl when we were trying on dresses at a department store.  If she would have payed attention for more than 10 seconds, she would have heard her calling me “Daddy” and our discussion about if the family will like her Christmas dress. She didn’t like my response of “ nah, I bought this kid cash money,” although the clerk thought it was hilarious.  "
508,Is this really a common thing? I’ve seen it mentioned twice here now but I don’t think I’ve ever encountered that in real life...?
509,Who DOESNT like wings??
510,What’s the name?
511,"Huh. My school in Australia has all that shit down pat - they have all the court orders on file, send out double for children of divorce etc...it's a shame it's not the case where you are.

I will say for me as a new dad, it was a bit odd that I wasn't officially part of anything to do with my son's birth - of course, I was there, supporting etc, but on the paperwork, they NEVER refer to the dad/partner as it's the mum who's the patient and the dad is the visitor. Felt a little cold but...well I have my son so that cheered me up a little! haha"
512,Not me but my brother dated a very short girl his senior year of high school who was an inch above being a legal midget. He was 6’0 and bearded. She tutored at the elementary school and when he would give her rides and they would kiss goodbye he would get very dirty looks from some parents.

525,"I had somewhat of a revelation about female cleanliness as I was chewing on a small ball of toilet paper I had just dug out of my FWB's pussy during oral sex.  That was many years ago and I've had a few more since then:

1) Menstrual blood can be somewhat ""chunky""
2) There is a wide variety of colors for female discharge. Some of which is not overly pretty.
3) Their taste and scent can vary over the month or based on what they eat.
4) Crap stinks, no matter the gender of the ""crapper""
5) BO is BO, and it stinks on women too
6) The whole ""front to back"" thing isn't always affective.
7) Sometimes it does smell sort of bad. Anytime biological fluids are left to decompose, it smells bad. But that same thought goes for men as well. If you don't clean up after ejaculating, old cum smells like death. :)"
526,"""Mansplaining"" I understand sometimes people do this in a condescending manner, which is wrong, but most of the time it's because we see a mistake you are making, and genuinely want to provide you with all the information so you can make the right decision on your own, without it being us just telling you to do something. I was accused of mansplaining the other day when trying to tell my cousin why it's dangerous to only scratch a bit of snow off to see out your windshield, and that clearing all your windows and roof off is not only safer for you but those around you.

Deliver an orgasm or six before penetration and you and your partner won't care if you're so worked up that you last less than a minute.

Stupid little things like having to specifically ask my son's school to send me the same notices and info that they send to his mom even though they have all of my info and know we are not together. The last parent teacher conference we had, I had to ask them to actually answer *me* when *I* ask the question or voice a concern. My ex is kind of quiet so I'm the one that does most of the communicating in these meetings and they would listen to me then literally turn to her with the answer. The little comments in public from acquaintances and strangers alike can be frustrating, too such as ""oh, day out with Dad, huh?"" And ""giving mom a break today?""

561,"Back in high school wrestling my coach showed us a video of an old wrestler crushing apples with one hand. For a few weeks afterwards, a bunch of us would bring apples for lunch and try to crush them or tear them in half.

Fast forward a few years. I was in college and I went outside on break to have a snack. One of my friends was sitting at a picnic table with a girl I knew, so I went to say hi. As we're talking I pulled an apple out of my bag and broke it in half, like I always do. The girl was staring with her mouth open and quietly asked me if I really just tore the apple open. I didn't think it was anything special so I offered her the half I hadn't bitten into yet and kept eating. I finished and went back to class but later found out that she asked the friend for my number because ""that was the most manly thing she'd ever seen."" "
562,Like how people feel sorry for the guy even tho she never wanted a big serious relationship with him and wasn't who he had built up this dream image (mpdg) of? 
563,F
564,"That really sucks, I'm sorry :(.  I know the feeling, and it fucking sucks.  Think of it this way, you dodged a bullet.  I rolled my eyes when someone told me that at first, but after a while you start to think maybe they're right, and the sucky feeling starts to fade.  Have a drink, treat yourself.. do something you enjoy, tomorrow's another day :)"
565,"When I was like 17 around 2004 I subscribed to someone's page for like a month, my reasoning was its only $20 and I was sick and essentially quarantined with a bad case of pnemonia at home so I wasn't thinking that well either. I mean there was better stuff for free of course, I just did it to see and viewed it as I'm spending less than a dollar a day so if I get off at least twice a day I guess I got my money's worth since it's more entertainment than I'd get going to a movie and getting food and drink for about that price "
566,"like a musket, I'm only meant to be fired once."
567,"I’ve literally had this exact problem recently and went with “I had a reaction to some new antibiotics, so can we rain check until around next week?” - because that’s how I got it. No hygiene issues or anything like that. "
568,"Got into a car accident.  I’m expecting some psycho to start screaming at me.  But as I get out of my car, I see a guy around my age.  We do the usual are you ok?  Start bsing around.  By the time the cops came, we were joking around like we were best buddies.  This was the least stressful accident I ever witnessed or been part of.  I’d rate it 10/10, definitely would hit this guy again."
569,"Dad here. Gifts are nice and all that but that will only get you so far. Based on what you describe, he's got it kind of rough. If I were in that situation, what I would want is for my kids to just be there and spend some time with me. It wouldn't have to be anything fancy, a dinner at Applebee's (yuck) would be fine if everyone just stayed off their phones and spent some time. Tell funny stories from when you were growing up. Let him know what kind of impact he had on your life. Most of all, make sure he feels loved and appreciated. Most men, that all we really want. "
570,21 year old should know better than to walk into their parents room at night without knocking. I think this is God's way of punishing you lmao
571,"Honestly, this boy sounds like he desperately needs a father figure and some discipline in his life. It looks like he is acting out as a call for help. I would talk to CPS, a big brother/big sister program, or other community aide program to see what can be done for him. The fact that he calls people he just met his friends and is trying to hang out at your place makes me think he is desperately looking for guidance and a stable place to live. Kids at that age crave stability and approval from older people. It sounds like he is not getting that at his uncles place so he is trying to force it from other people. Like I said before he sounds like a prime candidate for a community help program. "
572,... while T-posing.
573,"One of the biggest things I've had to deal with is the stigma. Whenever people hear I'm a single dad, they immediately jump to the conclusion that I drove my wife away or caused some break in the marriage. The look of surprise when I tell them I filed because my wife basically abandoned the family gets old real fast."
574,"The real secret is that both single moms and single dads are both quite knowledgeable about the problems of being a single parent.

Some people are just one-uppers."
575,I'm not allowed to talk about babies because I don't have my own and I'm male.

580,I won’t even ask what that is
581,Laughs in uncut
582,"As a woman, I seriously wish ALL dudes knew this. I’m married and have been for 8 years and I’m still trying to let my husband know that my nipples are sensitive and to please not play with my tits like they’re a DJ table. Also, if a guy is making some noise, it’s more likely that a girl will orgasm quicker. If she knows you like what she’s doing, it makes everything so much better. Most women are SUPER insecure about their bodies in the bedroom. Whether it’s the way our tits bounce, or our asses jiggle, or if our O face makes us look like demon spawn. Reassurance will get you further than going to pound town. "
583,should have married her probably
584,"Indulgences are back, baby!"
585,She should bear your seed and carry on your bloodline
586,"easiest one is your abs

also convenient because they're so integrated with your genitals, pelvic region, and back. It's easier to relax down there when a related muscle is tense."
587,"Emo girls with problems, like i tried to be someone who took care of them and have bonding moments and grow together emotionally, financially and academically.

It's your rule:  You determine how strictly you follow it.

;)"
593,"Oh man, I hope my husband doesn’t think this. Granted, he knows how I was raised and knew what he was getting into when he married me. My mom was a total helicopter mom and never let us make our own decisions. I have horrible anxiety and low-self confidence and I used to ask my husband about everything first for fear of screwing it up on my own. I didn’t even know how to cook, he had to teach me from the bare basics. He has been incredibly patient, but quietly encouraging for me to be more independent. And I definitely have improved greatly. But I’m still a far way off of being able to make big decisions without talking with him about it first. He’s never seemed bothered by it, so maybe I just married the right guy. He’s always happy to listen and offer his opinion if I ask, but never pushy or bossy or impatient."
594,What’s the name?
595,Because women are confusing. There are so many questions. 
596,"Dude I’d be real fucking hurt over the t shirt. Call it petty but come on, really? That’s one of the little things like friends seeing a movie without you that just scrape deep. Fuck them dude, I bet there was at least one scout that absolutely loved you but never said anything because kids don’t communicate lol"
597,"Be spontaneous with sex and enthusiastic.  Make him believe you can’t live without sex with him, the naughtier the better."
598,How the hell did you get gold for this lol.
599,"So the the sex one has been mentioned so I’ll move on.

I listen to stories about people she hates. For example her and her sister had a falling out over a year ago. They haven’t spoken since but I still have to listen to her vent about it. At some point it’s time to move on. 

I offer opinions when she askes knowing they’ll be ignored. No idea why you ask someone for advice or what have you if you’re just Going to do the opposite.

I fix things she breaks and accept her bs excuses as to how the damage happened and why she can’t fix it herself. 

I pretend to enjoy the shit tv she likes and pretend I don’t care when she falls asleep 5 min into what I like.

Overall she’s a good person but we all have our deficiencies. "
600,"Had a Korean girl call me handsome recently.

Was in Taiwan and she overheard me say I'd just come from Korea the night I arrived at the hostel, so she started speaking to me at breakfast. We were talking about solo travel and she said a drawback would be not having anybody to take pictures of you, and I said I hate pictures of myself. Then she said I shouldn't because I'm a handsome man.

Sure, she could have just been trying to make me feel better but I felt a lot better. Was super flattered. It also felt sincere.

I've been riding that high since last Sunday. "
601,"Ok, so maybe you just need to watch for more subtle hints. Strippers and waitresses are like a 12 on a 1-10 'is she flirting w/ me' scale. Watch for patterns. If someone *always* saves you a seat or buys you a coffee or makes sure to say hello/bye. "
602,"Honestly, the period.  I just always imagined that the pads or tampons kept things pretty clean and that it was a mildly unpleasant week for y'all and that it was just a little bit of blood and not a big deal.  Having my ex describe to me in detail the feeling of pulling out a tampon and the blood issuing forth after like an uncorked bottle of champagne broke that illusion.  I will *never* make light of periods after hearing that description (or seeing the aftermath in the toilet, which was enough to make me not each lunch that day).  Likewise, when my ex texted me at home asking to bring her a change of pants a few weeks later, I rushed with a new sense of urgency. "
603,"This Thousand times
if either of you aren’t enjoying it then it doesn’t matter if you can last 20mins or 2mins. 
Foreplay is seriously underestimated by men, most women won’t come solely by penetration. Foreplay and going on her is what gonna make the most difference between having great or okay sex. 
"
604,"People already think I'm gay, not gonna fuel that fire.

607,"I at first started to like short petite nerdy girls with freckles and glasses.

Then I started to like busty goths.

Then I started to like busty sporty girls with long legs.

Then I married a short petite nerdy girl with freckles and glasses."
608,"So, I need  help here.  You've just described my 16 year-old daughter and I'm so worried when I send her to college she's just going to freeze up like a deer in the headlights if she has to wake up and figure out where her class is.  It's so bad, while I was teaching her to drive, we were approaching a red light and she hesitantly asks me if she should stop.  This was not the first time she had driven on the road, including roads with red lights.  I wasn't mad, I wasn't disappointed, I was shocked.  I looked at her and asked her what she thought she should do.  We're getting closer to the intersection, and I'm waiting for her to slow down as she makes a decision.  She does not slow down, she refuses to make a decision and keeps her speed constant while looking worried until I have to yell, ""for God's sake stop!"" I didn't mean to yell, but I was also worried she was about to kill us.  She broke down in tears, I felt terrible, but at the same time, horrified at the possibility of unleashing her upon the world.  Is there anything besides _patience_ that would have helped you at this point? 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for the responses.  

She's a wonderful, beautiful, intelligent kid, and I know she can do whatever she decides to do. She's also my oldest, so everything she does is the first time for both of us. 

For those saying I probably messed up parenting her, you might be right.  It took having my own kids to realize parents aren't suddenly bestowed with perfect parenting knowledge when their kids are born. We're just people, doing the best we can to not screw them up too bad, and usually falling short of our own expectations in the process, but I know I'll never stop trying. And I'll never give up on her."

611,"Yeah, I understand. I don't compliment them every day. 

If I notice they got a haircut or if they are dressed really nice I will mention it. 

I also compliment people on doing a good job on a presentation and stuff like that (Presentations aren't very often, but it helps build confidence knowing you did well)"
612,Hospitals and clinics do this too.
613,Ask them if they're babysitting their own kids! For all the dads who get asked that by prying women.

620,"Let's not pretend that women don't do the same thing with attractive men. You get plenty of gawking women, inappropriate comments, and unwanted touching as an attractive guy. The difference being you only have to be in the top 50% to see it as a woman, and you need to be in the top 10% to see it as a man."
621,"I just continue about my hobbies and talk about them when asked, women (and people in general) like people who are passionate about things.  Be genuinely interested in what other people say for the value of their statement, not where it will get you. Don't assume that just because a woman is talking to you she's interested, if she's digging you she'll touch you or open her body language up more.  Don't be freaking creepy.  Work hard, it builds character and confidence.  Work out regularly and eat healthy, it shows you take care of yourself and care about yourself.  It also makes you happier.  Laugh about yourself, but know when self deprecating humour is sad.  (I'm balding, so I shave and use it to my advantage in conversations ""You'll get out of my hair?  Is that some sort of bald joke?"")

At my gym I climb with a group, it makes me being friendly to women outside the group a lot easier.  When I go alone I don't talk to women unless I've had a conversation before.  I don't act creepy (no blatantly staring at the women, no complimenting looks ever, no talking/joking about sex).  Talk about the problems/routes/beta/routine.  Compliment someone's progress if they're projecting, women or men.  I've found climbing gyms to be very social and positive places to meet new people.

Just be open, warm, and not judgmental to everyone around you.  That kind of positivity brings in people.  The more people you have around the more other people want to be around you.  The more people around you the more people you meet.  The more you meet the more likely you are to find someone you dig and digs you back and wants to do, ya know, ""stuff"" with.

It is working.  I've gotten phone numbers and dates from a few women at my gym but nothing stuck- we're better friends so I climb with them in our group now.  I've gotten dates on OKcupid and Tinder, but at my age (late 30s) it isn't about short term goals its  about long term, so you know pretty quick if there is staying power.

But honestly for me I like grabbing them because 9/10 times the girl is getting pleasure and turned on from it. So that turns me on more. And then it’s the birds and bees from there "

He’s now re-married to a woman 15yrs his junior, but between him leaving my mum, and him finding his new wife, (around 8yrs later) he was never in a shortage of beautiful young ladies in their late 20s. 
But the single Mum, sexual Harassment, making my dad too uncomfortable to be near my friend’s mum thing? That was fucked up. "

Her reaction to knowing Walter was lying to her, but she didn't know what about? Smoking while pregnant, then fucking her boss on the side, then giving Walter's money to her boss.

639,"Have a buddy in Tokyo, huge rugby/judo dude with cauliflower ears to add extra effect. 

Whenever he saw a random toxic dude doing his thing especially to Japanese girls who don’t know how to assertively say no, he’d get a big grin and go do his thing.  

Usually he’d grab the dudes ass.  More like a grab and twist.   Then when they turn around he’d pucker his lips up.  Usually that was enough but for some reason English dudes always want to go the distance.   If it got heated enough he’d just back hand their balls and drop them.  Never seen it go further than that "

It all happened in slow motion. I said, ""Turn around, man"" and he did, and there was a big ass Ferris Wheel. He then grabbed my shoulders and said, ""I feel like we're on the same level right now, and we'll never forget this moment."" Then we wished each other well and he ran off into the distance.

649,Another woman perspective: I am pretty shy and timid around people I don’t know really well. to be able to confront a man on the spot like that ESPECIALLY one I didn’t know or wasn’t familiar with would be next to impossible for me. I would be so immediately enraged that I would probably shut down and not react because of being so caught off guard. I probably wouldn’t even process the situation until hours later once it was long over. If I look uncomfortable after being touched or talked to by someone I would appreciate anyone regardless of gender stepping in and calling that person out on their bullshit.
