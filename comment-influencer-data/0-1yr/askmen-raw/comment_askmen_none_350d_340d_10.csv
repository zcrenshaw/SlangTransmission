1,"Used to get no Tinder matches.

Got in shape and still didn't get any matches.

For laughs I cropped my photos to hide my face. Boom. Started getting matches. Girls message me first. We snapchat, exchange nudes etc and they're asking when I can come over.

Then they ask to see a full photo of my face. After seeing it, they stop talking to me. Some are polite enough to say ""Sorry you're not my type"" but most simply ghost me."

6,"A lot of us ""slow down"" our work. Hell, I'm at work right now.

Here's why - If my boss knew I could do my 8 hour job in 4 hours, I'd suddenly be given a lot more tasks with no incentive. My salary is my salary. So what's the point?

7,"Film their kids twerking or put makeup on their kids and post it on social media. These kids are learning that they have to “perform” when ever they have a phone pointed at them. Currently you point one at them they automatically smile or do something “cute”.

20,"I have 14 medals from competitive Greek folk dancing, 4 of which are 1st place.


Edit: I'm super jazzed one of my highest upvoted comments is about my greek dancing prowess, cause it's one of the things I'm most proud of. I got a photo of my medals right [**here**](https://z-p3-scontent.fpnh5-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.18174-12/26694939_10208863838833266_631036936_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;oh=38d9e4d198e6fc63d67e21b9863547ef&amp;oe=5BAEBA72),  so you know I ain't just talkin'. Also, if you guys do wanna see some great examples of Greek Dancing, I believe FDF (the yearly competition I went to) still posts the videos of groups on Vimeo. For example, [**here's**](https://vimeo.com/41170869) my group when we competed in 2012 (it was the year most of us graduated high school and parted ways, so that was the last time we all competed together). As for something more recent, [**here**](https://www.facebook.com/SJGREEKFESTIVAL/videos/1495659783806870/) is a video from last year at a Greek Festival where I helped a kid I use to mentor do something cool that neither of us had tried before. 


Edit to the edit: It's official, this comment is my highest upvoted comment on reddit and [I'm tremendously happy](https://media1.tenor.com/images/10b0f75656c0790b88fd966b23b912f4/tenor.gif?itemid=7701894) that it's about my ability to Greek dance."
21,In my experience one person doesn't care about social media and the other cares too much.
22,"Lot of people saying that a better physique didn't get them an increased attention from women.  My experience was not that.  I certainly didn't have women coming out of the woodwork to feel my biceps like some corny romantic novel, but women that I initiated with were more receptive to my advances, and I even had several women initiate with me, which NEVER happened before.  Lifting/cardio also worked wonders for my confidence, cured my insomnia, made me a better hunter and skier, etc etc.  Stick with it...it's definitely worth it."
23,"When you’re invited in and she says, ‘Would you like a cold bottle of water’?  I say, ‘Sure, thanks.’  Then she says, ‘They’re  in the fridge . Get it yourself, I’m not your goddamned maid’!  Red flag number one, but who’s counting? "

26,"My girlfriend asked me this about a year ago. After a few minutes of thinking, I decided to just tell her the truth.

“Your last name.”

We’re getting married this December!"
27,"I dated someone for a while who was a survivor of rape. There were some issues with physical intimacy, but they lessened over time and I learned to prevent them from cropping up as well. The issues mainly revolved around various triggers that reminded her of her experience. As I learned what the triggers were, I always had them  in the back of my mind so that I could prevent them from becoming an issue. For example, the lighting in the room could trigger her, so I was always aware of the room lighting during sex and would adjust it if needed before it became a problem, and hopefully without her noticing what I was doing.

The other thing was being aware of her feelings and body language during sex so that I could tell if she wasn't feeling ok anymore. If I sensed something was off, I would stop and check in with her. If we did stop having sex because something was bringing back the memory of her trauma, I always made sure she knew that it was ok for us to stop and that I had no interest in having sex with her if she wasn't 100% into it. Usually this was while cuddling her, because I learned that's what she wanted in that moment.

If this sounds like I was walking on eggshells or like it was a lot of work for me, that wasn't the case at all. It wasn't any kind of burden for me to deal with, especially in comparison to what she was dealing with."

29,"I've been with 2 girls who have been sexually assaulted. One of them was slow to warm up physically, the other was quite the opposite. Both of them had significant emotional trauma and might freak out unexpectedly during physical intimacy. All you can really do is try to roll with it, give them every reason to trust you, and encourage them to get therapy if it's really damaging their life or your relationship."
30,I'd change her desire to change things about herself. 
31,I lost my virginity to a girl who had 4 nipples.
32,"Some people are going to come in and say you’re overreacting and that you should trust her but...

Fuck that, that’s sketchy as fuck. I’d be uncomfortable with it and I would make it known. I once almost cheated on my ex with a coworker in a nearly identical situation (swap genders) and it was a wake up call that I was unhappy in the relationship, so I decided to end the relationship instead of trying to have my cake and eat it too. "
33,"You don't lift weights to attract women.

You lift weights to develop self-confidence.

Confidence attracts women."
34,"/r/NoFap. It's actually what got me into reddit!

They used to be a group of guys who believed that there really was a societal issue with large groups of men being addicted to pornography and using it as a surrogate for actual human relationships. They believed in supporting each other in ending that addiction and improving their lot in life by going out and trying to have orgasms with *other people*. In this sense, I still support the movement.

Now it's all about the superpowers. They went off the rails really fast once they got popular."
35,"Simple =/= easy.

The answers to a lot of problems are simple but not easy.  Fat?  Exercise more, eat fewer calories than you burn - you will lose weight tubby.  Alcoholic?  Try not drinking alcohol anymore, ya drunkard.

BTW, ""be confident"" here really means in the short term ""don't outwardly advertise your self-doubt, and learn to recognize the inner voice that is sabotaging you and push past it.  Long term, identify achievable goals and a plan to achieve them, and work the plan until you reach them.  Rinse and repeat, and each success will strengthen your faith in yourself so that you have *reason* to be confident.  Then you're a healthy, capable person who knows he can overcome obstacles and persist in the face of adversity, and not just some jerkweed who's brainwashed himself into thinking he's great.  Unfounded confidence is also known as arrogance, and it is not a good look.

There, nothing *easy* about that, but it's a roadmap.  The rest is up to you.  "
36,"I have a landline at my house, and my phone has an answering machine. I rarely listen to messages; I'll usually just flip through the caller ID to see if any real people called, then call them back and ask them what they wanted. Once in awhile I'll clear out the 40 or so messages that are in there. The machine separates new messages from old (listened-to) messages. When you play them back, it first plays you the new messages and then plays you the old ones.

About two weeks ago I was clearing out the new messages, and then it got to the old messages. And I got kicked in the nuts. There was a message there from my mother who passed away last December. It was a nothing message, just her saying hello and wondering if I'll be around on a certain day because she bought something for my daughter and wanted to drop it off when I was home. The timestamp on the message put it at almost two years before she died, meaning it was left before she even knew she had cancer. I wanted to scream into the phone and tell her to GET TO THE DOCTOR NOW but, of course, I couldn't. I sat down in my desk chair and listened to the message three more times, being extra careful to not delete it afterwards. Then I played it again and recorded it into my computer. It's a shitty recording as they all are, but it's still recognizably my mom.

The message is still on the house phone."
37,"My ex was into the 'male pheromone' smell,  so you can guess where this is going...she often requested I wear my home clothes for days before giving it to her. That is probably one of the least NSFW examples I could say.

Also, she attempted to make me fat so I'd be 'unattractive' to other girls (she told me that after I asked her). She always gave the bulk of her food to me, ordered larger portions for me and got really mad when I didn't finish my food.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember, when I was in my college days a few years back, we hosted a few Japanese girls on cultural exchange. 3 hours in, and once the girls got comfortable, they bombarded me questions such as: what underwear was I wearing? what is my favorite sex position? do I prefer muscular, or lean men? They got really excited and squealed at my replies, no matter how 'safe' I answered them. It almost felt like a page off a manga. That was surreal."

65,"One of my former partners experienced repeated abuse in her early teens (I got to know her arround 20). I was her first partner. She had all trauma symtoms you could imagine (I'm sparing you the details).

Over the cause of several years we succeeded at working all of that down and bring her to the point where she could experience and enjoy sex in pretty much normal manner.

The following things might be helpful:

In general communication is key. Make sure to make her comfortable to communicate her internal state. Actively inquire how she is doing and wether she's comfortable.

Pay utmost attention to her non-verbal communication (body becomming stiff, activity reducing on her side). When in doubt go slower (speed/intensity, also don't progress without communicating.

Ask her wether she has key triggers (e.g. touching certain body parts), memorize those and avoid them.

Make sure to actively reassure her that she is in control of the situation.

You can do that as a sort of play: Ask her to just say ""stop"" at a random point (even though she's still ok) and then stop, so she experiences that she can influence the situation. Repeat that to build trust.

Do just that for a while until she has become reasonably comfortable with being intimate in general.

Then progress (with respect to practises), both of you can suggest things to try. Again communication before, during and after the act is key.

From here on out it's basically a special form of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic\_desensitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization)

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck and much success.

Remember you're not going to ""make love"" with her, but rather are a kind of training partner / therapist (in the most abstract sense of the term). So manage your expectations accordingly.

67,Uhhh dude.. speaking from tons of experience I will say this is not good. If she starts being super protective or sneaky with her phone just get out. You should IMO voice your concern and let her know that being friends is one thing but to text another person non stop isnt cool nor is it necessary for just friends and going to the movies WITHOUT you?? Nope!
68,"This is exactly how my first serious relationship ended.  'Oh, I don't have any friends here and I get along with him so well.'   When I voiced my concern that they'd gone to dinner and to other social events just the two of them (like movies, although not specifically that) I was told that I 'needed to let her have friends and branch out.'  Yeah, branched out enough that our own tree fell over.

One day he got sick of it and felt like he was going nowhere so he decided to dig himself a lake so that ""even if I go nowhere I don't have to go nowhere to get to the lake."" Initially started selling all the dirt and gravel to break even on the backhoe but quickly discovered he had a ton of gravel on his property and it became a gravel quarry. Now he's rich enough to stock his personal lake with fish and his farm is literally just his hobby now. He sold most of his cattle and horses and just kept the animals he wanted to raise for fun and paid my dad for years to help him as a farm hand. First time I ever got knocked over and stepped on by a horse was out there... My dad had just told me about how a horse could kill you doing just that too so I literally thought I was dead as that horse stepped on me while I lie there out of breath.

73,"It means critically evaluating yourself and improving your life and your circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you know that maybe you don't know everything and you should seek more information about the world around you and challenge some of your own opinions. You know you have some weaknesses - are those real weaknesses or are you hiding from the work it would take to be a version of yourself you'd appreciate more?  


It means to get to know yourself and what you'd do if you didn't have the influence of a partner guiding your decision-making. Where are your boundaries truly? What parts of your life can you manage just fine and what would be really helpful if you had a partner to share duties with? Why do you even want a fucking girlfriend, really? Just sex? Can you get enough sex while skipping the relationship part and still be happy? What kind of companion do you really want? What do you offer them?  


Understand your habits, your idiosyncrasies and why you do shit. Understand what kind of man you want to be that would please you and live up to your expectations of you, not some image of you someone else might want to see for their own reasons, then figure out how to get there. Learn to articulate who you are to strangers. Come to grips with your guilty pleasures perhaps to the point they're not guilty pleasures, they're just quirks of your personality (e.g. I fucking love Xena: Warrior Princess... and I think her sidekick is hotter than the title character. Don't ask me why.)

But whenever somebody talked about men being sexually assaulted, the response wasn’t “yeah, men have to deal with it too, and it’s horrible,” it was “ok, but women have it worse, and because men are oppressing women, women’s sexual assault is a more important issue.” When I ended up getting sexually assaulted it was the same thing, instead of being supportive of me they were competitive about who had it worse.

Another thing, when I’ve dated super sex-positive chicks they sometimes seem like they have a problem taking “no” for an answer, or feeling the room to figure out whether or not a proposition is good idea. My dog died and when she came over to comfort me she also asked if I was down to fuck. Same when my grandma died, and when my mom got diagnosed. And other times when they ask and you say “no, I’m not really in the mood right now,” instead of saying “ok, nevermind,” they’ll ask “are you *sure*” and then start rubbing your crotch to get you there.

116,I’ve had one of those that was super quick to it. In fact she was horny 100% of the time and she told me that I looked like her rapist. I woke up to her giving me a blowjob once. She touched me incessantly. It was unhealthy to say the least
117,"Pretty much any political sub. If you're are on the correct side you get upvoted like crazy, if you are on the incorrect side, you get downvoted to hell. There is no such thing as a political discussion, so each one becomes it's own echo chamber. Not my thing anymore. "
118,"Use their gender as a legitimate defence in a confrontation.

Call me a jackass for this, but I’ve had times where I’ve been punched or kick by girls when I was young(er) solely because they felt like it, and the second I pushed them away or instinctively hit back I was the spawn of Satan because it was a woman who was attacking me.

Can you imagine if the roles were reversed? What if I were the one who’d just attacked a woman because I’d felt like it, then the second she hit back I’d shouted in her face that she wasn’t allowed to hit me back because I’m a man?

Insanity."
119,"I don’t think this is Stockholm syndrome, as the other commenter said.

A pretty common reaction to trauma is trying to take control of the situation. Probably the girl was looking to take charge in the relationship because having sexual dominance over her “rapist” would give her a sense of control and independence. It’s definitely not the healthiest coping mechanism but there is some logic behind it."

I told her in confidence about being abused in the past, specifically telling her that this was personal information that I was only comfortable telling her about and no one else should know.

I was absolutely furiously, broke up with her immediately and cut her out of my life. Apparently I was the asshole in this situation as well. "

We never had sex and I didn’t try to talk her into it. She was my first girlfriend. We made out sometimes which was nice but I did notice that she never really liked to get a hug me for more than 2 seconds and then shed gently squirm and push away which kinda made me sad but now I kinda get it.

Women are generally more open/nice with me, pay more attention to me, might initiate a conversation with me etc which almost never used to happen. I also have been getting some compliments (that's still rare but better than literally 0 comments like before).

To be honest though, I started going to the gym to be more physically attractive but it has indirectly boosted my confidence as well which is also a very helpful thing. The gym is also really fun! I love spending a couple of hours on a Sunday morning there.

Still fuck squats though

146,"It started with the claim that if you quick jerkin your gerkin for like a month your testosterone doubles which decreases anxiety and depression, helps you lose fat and add muscle, and that both of those aspects taken together would make you more attractive to women. There's a grain of truth to it, in that testosterone has a mild effect on brain chemistry and the ability to put on muscle. Also, if you feel bad about constantly masturbating then obviously successfully abstaining from it would make you feel better.

However, it quickly got taken to an extreme. It became ""In the one month since I quit masturbating I'm no longer suicidally depressed, have six girlfriends, lost 80 lbs, took up rock climbing, tripled my bench press, got a promotion, and totally turned my life around. Thanks NoFap!""

Naturally this began to spawn memes involving super powers. ""Ever since I quit masturbating, I developed x-ray vision. This is making it hard not to masturbate."" or ""Hey /r/NoFap, I'm at the point where I can lift a semi with one hand, but now some chick wants to blow me. How much muscle mass am I gonna lose if I have an orgasm?"" Hilarious, sure... but when someone starts making memes about your ideals, you *might* be a bit crazy."

169,"I really don't feel like it's bad to want to be alone.  If I go like this, it's usually for a few months at a time.  And it's not hard to contact your closest friends and family once every few weeks just to check in.  If you're an adult then it's easier to blame it on a job or something that's taking up more time than normal.
To answer more directly, I wouldn't stop it and I would just try to keep in touch every few weeks depending on how long it lasts."
170,"I didn't starting lifting for women, I started lifting for me because I didn't/don't like the way I look. I have noticed a difference though. 2 years ago when I was at my biggest(still not very big) and leanest, nearly every time I went out I got approached by women. Some very aggressively.

It was honestly a shock because I have never had that happen before and it was happening what seemed like every time I turned around and I definitely don't follow rules 1&amp;2. The more aggressive ones got touchy fast and would make sure to brush across my stomach. After a few months of bulking it went back to me being almost invisible.

 I have good lat insertions and a great taper when lean so I guess that's what they were seeing to let them know I was in good shape. Add a little fat and its not as noticeable clothed. "

Molestation and Rape at the hands of her father a pastor. 

During sex she had to see my face at all times. The one time I forgot and she didn’t say anything... she freaked out so badly I never forgot ever again.

She went to therapy for EVERYTHING, except the actual thing that mattered. When I suggested the general bad idea that I confront her father on her behalf she said “no I love my dad too much to do that to him” I sadly responded with “he didn’t seem to love you enough not to do it to you, why should you give a fuck how he feels” that was the beginning of the end.

DISCLAIMER: I was 18 and stupid. I thought I could fix the entire worlds problems with my own two hands. Now I know these things require care, respect, and precision not an uncaring bull in a china shop.

178,"Oh... My gosh. You're overthinking it. Usually you do a coffee date first in case the date sucks and you don't want a full on dinner. Keep the coffee date it's fine. You can get decaf, tea, whatever. Maybe do a little snack at the coffee place. Look it up before hand and mention you've heard they had really good pastries or something. 

If she lives close enough picking her up is cute. If not just meet there. 

Edit: you kinda gotta read the room after the date and see if she'd like to go to dinner or if she's good with going back home. (it's not a bad thing if she doesn't want dinner). "

This one woman would call the front desk about 10-20 times a night (no exaggeration, we started keeping a tally) and ask to be transferred to whatever room he was in. But most nights he would stop answering at some point and if they don’t answer the call comes back down to the desk and she would ask us to find him and tell him to call her. All I’m thinking is, “he obviously doesn’t want to talk to you.” "

186,"I am currently at my day 74 of no fap.. And today as I exited my vehicle to walk into work I caught scent of a female in heat 73.35 meters upwind. Because of the fog I couldn’t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid twenties, and healthy. My ultra attunated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5’6”. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me. Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike. I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinters starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth. As I float into the the celestial abyss of the greater Crab Nebula I am not filled with regret for having left my world, but rather happiness for having left it a better place. You’re welcome gentlemen"

Doing so would also give employees who put in legit 10 hour work days the opportunity to earn more income. "

I don’t ever want to be drunk. I’d like to always be in control of myself and have zero chance of hurting somebody (physically or emotionally) due to being drunk. It’s a lot easier to just never start drinking.

I don’t do sex outside of marriage and I don’t want marriage. Sure, I was a bit awkward in my youth and didn’t know how to talk to girls, which contributed. But now it’s entirely my choice. No, I’m not a Mormon.  If I was, I’d probably be married and have five kids by now lol."

I very rarely have anything good to talk about or anything I want to share and I'm really bad at faking that everything is o.k. when it's not.

I mean, the nastier something is, the more likely he is willing to eat it. about 2 years ago, I was walking next to one of the busiest boulevards of where I live during rush hour, with my dog. He was doing squatting down to poop, but didn't get up. Instead, he stayed in that position for ages, so I go to check out. Usually this means he has diarrhea so other than doing some more diligent cleaning, I wasn't too concerned. Untill it took longer and longer and it was clear something was stuck, people started pointing at him from their cars.. still not too suspicious. Untill he turned around and I see a full 2 inches of a poop-stained condom hanging from his ass.. So here I was, with my good intentions, trying to pull my own used condoms from my dogs ass, while not trying to make it snap and release all the poop all over my arms..

The key is to call them on it ASAP.  When people ask for a hard truth and you confirm with them that they really want the truth you have to right away bring up that they asked you for your honesty.  If you let it stew too long before calling them out you'll have no chance at changing their mind, we all get really set in with our beliefs and emotions.

* bathroom got cleaned more often, though the plug was always full of hair
* period smell. whatever.
* i thought i would mack on their friends, but ... it never really seemed appropriate or polite. or attractive.

One of those games was Pokemon Colosseum and I was one fight with the mayor from completing it. Motherfucker.

Anyway back to it.

It's also possible the guy was just... oddly curious about your room and wanted to scope it out. I used to go to house parties and on my way to the toilet see slightly into someones room. I never did go in but I was always mad curious what sort of stuff they had lying around/what their jam really was.

3 - As I look back at them, they THEN stop and start laughing among themselves.

I went from literally, genuinely thinking my tinder was broken because i would get 0 matches to being able to get 6-10 daily. An increase in confidence won’t do anything if women is plainly just not attracted to you. And in my experience, lifting and building muscle made ALL the difference; the added confidence was just a byproduct of a now desirable look. "

The amount of moderating and censorship is maddening over there. You get awful posts like, ""Men are afraid of the female uprising because they know they're gonna get treated like women were."" And any sane person who disagrees saying, ""Is this a thing? Are men afraid of an uprising? Do men think this or is this paranoia and making up other people's thoughts?"" will see their comments removed. The thread I'm referring to was locked and ~75% of the comments deleted.

When I dated someone, she had strong opinions and funny reactions, and of course pretty cool insights which was nice.

318,"I hate 'bragging', but when I covered a woman in highschool during a tornado that destroyed our highschool. A friend of mine and myself covered a woman seconds before it hit. She was and still is all of 110lbs 11 years later. He and I both broke our collar bones, ribs, and some back damage, but she was safe as could be. Him being 6'2"" and me 6'7"" covered all of her 5'1"" self as well as we could and she only left with some scrapes and glass in her knees while we took the brunt. I had 2 broken ribs, broken collar bone, half my scalp hanging off; and he only had a broken collar bone, but we walked away while getting her out safely. 

Nothing in my life will compare to the pride I deeply try to hide from that. I never want to seem like I did it simply to sound like some rort of stupid fucking 'hero', but more simply that I did it because I valued her life more than my own and so did my friend. 

I'll never compare to that moment and I know it. It brings tears to my eyes simply thinking/typing it out because I never wanted the attention, I only wanted to help. "

I'm at my usual bar, just chilling, and this woman ask me to dance. I just spent a few hours on my feet before I came there, so I say no.

330,"Yeah, I've something similar to that. Woke up with a girl I was dating on top of me once. It was uncomfortable and made me feel weird, but I was a lot younger and had no idea how to react, so I just let her finish and pretended I was ok with it. I'm big enough that I could have pushed her off if I'd needed to, but I just lay there frozen, not knowing what to do.  I didn't pursue the matter further with her at the time (though we did eventually talk about it), because she genuinely thought that she was surprising me and that I'd be happy to be woken up with sex. I wouldn't call it sexual assault, more just a miscommunicaton and assumption that lead to an uncomfortable situation. Her heart was in the right place, it was just that we should have talked about consent while asleep first.

&amp;#x200B;

What really bothered me though was the reaction from friends, both male and female. The people I told about it acted as if I should be grateful and proud about what happened, even though I was uncomfortable and not enjoying it. Not one single person ever considered my feelings as legitimate, some even suggested I was less of a man for not being into it. It was pretty demeaning so I've just not told anyone since. I'm not friends with any of those people anymore. I now have at least one male and one female friend who I could talk to if anything like this happened again and they wouldn't laugh it off with something like ""Stop being such a wimp and man up. I wish my Mrs would do that to me!""."
331,"One of my oldest friend’s fathers did this. He had an affair with a co-worker and ended up marrying her. Surprisingly, her and her brothers were ok with it and loved the new wife, and now more than 20 years later, they’re still married.

But their mother took it very hard. She even tried committing suicide a few years ago, which was so sad because I’ve known this woman since I was a kid. She never quite bounced back.

The dad also has this mysterious child pornography charge that nobody ever talks about. My friend always says “I don’t know the details, but Step-Mom just says that if it was serious she wouldn’t have stayed with him, so I believe it isn’t serious.”

I think my friend and her brothers just have a practice of brushing things under the rug when it comes to the dad, and I think the same thing happened with the affair. "

344,"My boyfriend and I embarrassingly have a de facto joint account. He never wanted to make a Facebook so I just had him jump on mine for group chat and planning purposes. I never used the actual Facebook portion of the account, only the FB messenger. Eventually he got sucked into the scrolling and checking out my feed, and eventually joined some meme groups under my account.

The group chats became confusing with both of us posting under the same name, so he caved and made a dummy FB account for just the group chats, but since he likes watching my crazy family members and family friends he still uses my Facebook for entertainment.

The funny part is that it works out for me too, since I've always been missing big things happening in my family circles since they'd be announced via Facebook. Now he shoots me texts when actually noteworthy things happen.

417,"A woman hit my car then when I said I was going to call the police she began crying and saying her son was in the hospital in critical condition and she didn’t “have the time for this”.   I bought it for the first minute until I glanced at her car and saw her passenger with a big smile on his face.  Judging by his age he could be her son.

The police arrived and she gave the policeman the same story and then added that I hit her and I caused the accident.  I looked her in the eye and said to both her and the officer that it’s disgusting that an adult won’t take responsibility for their mistakes and that if I had caused the accident I would admit it.   The policeman then said, well I didn’t witness the accident so I can’t say who’s at fault.  Immediately like a switch was thrown, she stopped crying and started smiling. The urgent need to get to the  hospital suddenly disappeared.  

The policeman gave me a sheet with all her info (common in my state after an accident).   I’m a landlord so I subscribe to a background research service and I looked her up.  The woman who hit me was in her late 30’s to early 40’s the info on her drivers license was for a 67 year old woman.  She was clearly using her mother’s drivers license as an ID and got away with it.  So I called the woman and told her what happened and she was very thankful and said her daughter has always had problems.  I then told my insurance company what happened and they assured me they would not be paying her a dime.

These things happen sometimes and we're just unaware until they come knocking at our door.

The next few days will be hard. Reach out - family and friends are willing to help, and you guys surely need assistance right now. Allow yourselves to feel and express your sadness, but remind yourselves that sometimes you just get dealt a shitty hand for no good reason. There's no point in asking why because it's just NOT your fault.

Every day, terrible things happen to good people like you. This is unfortunate, but it is the way it is. The road ahead is long and rocky, and it will feel like you won't be able to reach the end, so many times. But you WILL come through, my friend. Our hearts are with you."

461,"This was my reasoning as a teenager when I started, basically just get big and attract the chicks. It did work, a bit, in high school, but with time I came to enjoy lifting on its own as a healthy part of my routine and didn't give the other motivation any thought as my size became part of my identity.

Every once in a while I have come across a girl aggressively infatuated with me because of the muscles but it isn't that common of a thing. Girls do generally see it as attractive but it's just another component of multiple, you still need a good personality and life/character to complete the deal or else you're basically just bimbo bait. Luckily enough being jacked can help give you the confidence to go out and work on/test some other traits.

Now let me tell you about the other results (as an 8+ year lifter now) that I consider major: hormonal/chemical balance from exercising, higher BMR (metabolism) from muscle mass meaning you can eat more and get away with it, obviously being able to stand your ground and defend yourself or others against most, increased self-esteem and increased respect from most people which by extension plays into your own confidence in life as time goes on. For a 4-5 hour commitment on a weekly basis, who can afford not to spend the time on their body? Men were built to toil, it's the best substitute we have as modern sedentary people."

472,"The majority of women prefer slim men who are taller than they are, with *some* muscles in the chest &amp; shoulders, and a good butt.

I bulked up in college because I *liked* lifting and the kind of women I was interested in would write me off by first impressions based on my appearance.

473,"My wife wasn't raped, but she was physically abused. Her ex would try to turn her around and choke her during. So, she naturally doesn't appreciate anything near her throat ever. 

She wasn't reluctant to be intimate, though. The only hang-up (and I'm hesitant to call it that) is that she isn't able to perform a sexual position if she's facing away from me. 

It's a bummer, because I'm totally an ass man and she's got one that won't quit. But I understand and I can live without it. 

My wife is a really, *really* strong woman. To the point where I can get jealous of how well put-together she is. She always says, ""I choose not to be a victim because I'm not one anymore. I was, I defended myself, I survived and now that's what I am. A survivor. Not a victim.""

He’s ardently childfree and had a vasectomy but doesn’t feel the need to be upfront with women about this. I can’t say I approve of his behavior but he gets laid a lot."

479,"Most guys I've met, positive or negative relationships. I can expect a certain level of that same positive or negative interaction once boundaries are defined. And vibes I get along with first impressions can generally steer me towards what kind of relationship I will have with that person.

I've known women who could wildly 180 and pretend to genuinely like a friend of a friend then they tell me how much they hate that guy's guts.

I've seen guys pretending to like women fake charm and all that. But I could always tell the genuine from the non. Perhaps only because of experience with my own sex. Still I have my doubts.

It's creepy how much women can ""change their mind"" on something genuinely. I can understand hiding initial reactions, then the true opinion coming out. But actually changing their mind about someone or something wildly just makes no sense to me.

If person is a jerk 80% of the time and nice the rest of it they are just a jerk whi can be nice.

* You are cruising along and your world makes sense  
* Some new factor arises, possibly in work  
* This new factor doesn't fit into your plan.  You don't know how to handle it  
* The moment it first pops up, you don't think it's a big deal.  However from this moment onward, your energy is lower.  You don't notice at first  
* There is a subconscious conflict in your mind because you now have a situation where you can make a bad step no matter which direction you go.  
* The resolution here would be to process an order of magnitude more information than you usually must, and if you do so you will find a resolution.  
* But you don't so there's this conflict.  
* The conflict causes a decrease in serotonin, and an increase in cortisol.  
* Cortisol puts your brain into ""prey"" mode.  Like a good prey animal, your instinct is to stay hidden.  
* You withdraw from life  

You stay withdrawn until you process the new situation and come to a decision about how you will handle it.  As soon as you have mental clarity, the serotonin comes back and you enter ""explore and hunt"" mode again.  This mode is characterized by enjoying going out."

521,"I was two weeks shy of my 14th birthday. I needed new shoes my feet were rapidly growing with the onset of puberty I already had outpaced all the males in my family in shoe size. My mom took me to the shoe store, I bought the only shoes I bought back in the day. Vans graph smoke and Grey but these ones were size 13. A few nights later I’m at church, enjoying the cool couches and lounge area set up for the “youth.” Goofing around with my friends doing teenage boy hood rat stuff. In walks the girls, they thought we were annoying of course. Insults and teasing on both sides begin. Finally one of the girls drops the ultimate middle school zinger directs toward me. “Act your age not your shoe size Phil!” Inside I gleamed with excitement, this was it, this was the moment, the best comeback of all time was about to happen. The ultimate shut down, there would be no recovering from this I had her cornered, she was done and didn’t even realize it. I kept my cool, I walked over popped my new sneakers up on a couch arm rest where she was sitting. Pulled the tongue out of my shoe so everyone could see on the big white tag what my shoe size was. And I calmly said “well I’m 13 and that’s my shoe size also.” Boom the crowd erupted, the girl looked stunned, humiliated, ashamed all at once. It was utter disbelief. She had fucked with me during the one two week period of my life where she would be slaughtered. The crowd kept yelling and cheering, I had won. She left humiliated. I was the king. But I also knew at that time I had hit my absolute peak, that was it, I could retire. "

Working out has changed my mindset about myself completely. There was a time I worked out for women. Now I workout to better myself (attracting women is a 2ndary perk). I've made a ton of attractive female friends through the gym. Women I would have NEVER ever thought I would have even been able to approach. Last week I asked out one of the most attractive women  (physically and mentally) I've ever met out on a date for this weekend. 

My level of self believe and confidence is miles ahead of my pre-gym self. Learn new aspects of working out (not just body building / mix other schools of movement in). Expand your horizons. When you set a new PR or learn a new bodyweight skill embrace. Take that feeling of success and try to replicate it. To me that feeling almost is as good as having a crush. "

I had, emphasis on had, a girl friend who was completely platonic and I never pushed for anything sexual between us because I wasn't attracted to her, I knew she had an std, she was my best friends ex (I introduced them and did not think they'd get together), had fucked my roommate, and had a lot of issues.

Well one night we were catching up and we got really drunk and I let her crash at my place so that she wouldn't drink and drive. I woke up to her trying to take my clothes off and essentially trying to fuck me. I pushed her off of me and told her that nothing was going to happen and that she should just go back to sleep. I knocked out again only to find her going even further. I completely pushed her off and locked myself in the bathroom where I knew I'd be safe.

Now whenever I told this part of the story the large majority of people laughed and were some would call my a pussy for not going through with it especially since I'm a virgin. It isn't until I tell them that I knew she had herpes and that I know for a fact there weren't any condoms in the area that they start being a bit more sympathetic. I'm like why weren't you giving me sympathy for having someone try to fuck me while I'm passed out drunk and after I verbally said that I didn't give my consent for it. That's pretty fucked up if you ask me. But STDs is where everyone draws the line. "

530,some weirdos like that
531,its funny cos Im approaching late 30s and never wanted kids and this is precisely my experience with men. I tend to date childless men 40+ and they start going through the same motions in the 40s. Suddenly want babies.
532,"I used to like /r/lastimages when it was filled with pictures of people doing heroic things, pictures of historic executions, etc. The sort of images that made me think ''Wow, I wonder what it was like right there and then''. A post with a picture of a fire engine heading towards the World Trade Center on 9/11 and information about the crew in there springs to mind.

When I unsubscribed, it was pretty much nothing but people posting pictures of deceased family members who had died through various 'normal' causes. Old age, illness, accidents, etc.

534,"So I got really in shape once. Got lots of compliments. Had one girl stop me in the rain to tell me how fucking sexy I was.  I got more smiles from women. That sort of thing. But I was (and still am) married so nothing more than that happened with any of them. My wife also changed and would more aggressively pursue sex with me than before.

But then I got fat and all of that disappeared. I’m married so it’s not like anything was going to happen, but I do miss getting looks, smiles, and compliments from strangers.  And I miss the way my wife used to sneak up behind me and wrap her arms around me and make that “sexy growl” noise.

Damnit. I think I just talked myself into getting a gym membership and eating healthier. "
535,I was the first person born in Canada to a father that was taking chemo treatments to come out without any deformities.
536,"I have very dark eyebrows, but they're very patchy and misshapen. I have to shape them to look like lady eyebrows, then color them in so I don't look like a chemo patient. Not an uncommon thought process. "
