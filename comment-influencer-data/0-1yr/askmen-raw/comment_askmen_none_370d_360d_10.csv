0,"There's a strange push-pull in today's society where we both need to adhere to masculine gender norms but also not adhere to them. It's naturally more nuanced, but the messages we get tend to be contradictory.

You never share your feelings with me; man up, you're being a pussy.

Don't make women uncomfortable with your attentions; of course you never get laid, you aren't initiating.

Treat her like an equal across the board; choke her during sex, girls love it rough. 

As a man in my 30s, I've learnt somewhat how to deal with this - though it took a major relationship fuck up to realize many of my mistakes. But I worry for young boys growing up without strong role models - it's a fucking nightmare to navigate."
1,"Because you don't want to go apple picking, you want to wear flannel and have me take a picture of you picking an apple from a tree then buy a cider donut.

6,"TIL apple picking is a thing.

7,"Basically it.  

I'm from the south so Apple picking was never a thing growing up.  I moved to the midwest, met my now wife, have been taken apple picking the past 4 years and still don't get it.

I'm PAYING money after driving for ~90 mins to go do a manual labor job that farmers typically pay workers to do?  

It's not even just a ""#basic white girl"" thing anymore either.  My wife has both of our black asses out there ~~their~~ picking fucking fruit.  I always joke that my people have done enough fruit/vegetable picking to last 50 generations, I don't want to do that shit for fun."

11,"In the Canadian army. 

Doing inspection in the morning. One Pte has a sunflower seed addiction. The Sgt finds a shelled seed on his shirt pocket and goes ballistic. Flips all of our beds and lockers. 

Then he brings it back to the Pte and tells the Pte to put out his hand. Informs him that the seed is his new best friend and a new member of the section.

Guy had to make a paper home and paper clothes and find family members for this seed. 

Every inspection he was with us held open palmed in this pte's hand with the dude having to do up paperwork for the seed and rattling off his service number. 

They had to have a little stick for the rifle. 

By the end of course he had full pocket of useless garbage that had accumulated for this seed.

Anyways idiot lost it in the field ex. And when the Sgt found out he made the guy hold a candlelight vigil. 

Edit: hey my first gold. Thanks my guy. "

18,"One of my fellow recruits got caught singing in the shower. Our TI came running in and yelling ""I didn't know we had American Idol auditions going in here, why didn't anyone fucking tell me?"" As we turn around all butt naked and he looks at this kid and quietly says, ""you have 30 seconds to get dressed and be at my office.""

For the remainder of boot camp he referred to this Vietnamese kid as William Hung (American Idol contestant who sang ""she bang"") He would randomly call him out of formation and make him sing random songs he could think of. When he fucked up his clothing detail, he put him in a locker and would drop quarters into the slot and hit the locker really hard and tell him to sing. 

The hardest part of the ordeal was trying not to laugh as he had a really bad accent, especially when trying to sing country music. If we were caught laughing he would rip us a new one. Good times."
19,"""First one of you privates reassemble your M-16 gets a bottle of baby oil and a half hour alone in the shower!""

Hands were smoking after that."
20,"Drill sergeant came in the barracks at 11 at night and caught a kid who had taken crackers back with him from dinner. Drill sergeant was yelling the whole time and woke everyone up. Then he broke the crackers up in the kids bed and made the kid get back in bed, and saying, ""We got a fucking pack-rat over here! Let me hear you squeak rat!"" The kid had to squeak like a rat while laying in a bed full of crumbs."
21,"An ex had lupus. Didn't affect our relationship, but after we broke up, I saw there was some new discovery related to it, so I unblocked her, sent her the article, and reblocked her. "
22,"I turned to give her a cheeky kiss on the cheek to tease her after making a joke while we were walking somewhere after dinner.  She chose that moment to turn her head to look at me and say something so I ended up giving her a peck on the lips instead of on her cheek.

She immediately grabbed my lips with her own and started sucking on them and making out with me, so I shrugged and figured ""Ok, I guess we're making out now,"" and reciprocated and we worked up to a little bit of tongue action which apparently brought her back to herself and she broke away and was mad at me for just making out with her in the middle of the street and refused to acknowledge that she was the one who had started making out.

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up giving me shit about that for about a week and started chatting up my best friend and started having inappropriate conversations and cheating on me with him and got him to take her side on the matter and then broke up with me.  Then she came out as a lesbian.  And then she started dating him after having just come out of the closet as being a lesbian.

Weird as shit, that episode was.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** This was all over a decade ago when we were all fairly young, so bear that in mind."

27,"In basic we had to fold a lot of things into perfect squares. This one guy didn't do one right, it was uneven and I think had more than five sides.

He was getting yelled at.

""How many sides does a square have?""

""Four sir""

""How many sides does yours have?""

""More than four sir""

""What shape is that?""

""I don't know, a polygon?""

This was at the end of a very stressful inspection that lasted 90 mins and this guy V was the final guy. We all struggled not to snort, and the LT just looked at him, muttered ""a fucking polygon"" and walked away.

We were pretty sure he was trying not to laugh too"
28,"My company commander (Navy) was a woman. She was teaching us how to make our bunks properly. You had to fold the top sheet down six inches, so you can imagine all the fun she had with that. I remember her yelling at one guy who had folded his sheet down way too short: ""What the f--k is this??? Your girlfriend been telling you this is what six inches looks like for so long you started believing her???"""

31,"Im a 38 year old woman and Ive noticed that for the past 10 years or so when I was dating rather casually (i have a partner now). You need to very specifically signal or tell a guy outright you want to fuck. For quite some time I thought maybe I wasnt attractive enough but then why would he continue to ask me out. 
  Once I kissed him or made a move towards sex hed be all over me immediately but before that hed just sit next to me on a sofa and stare at me. I think its because men really are terrified of coming across as potential rapists and its sad."
32,Tony Montana / Pulp Fiction poster framed.
33,"I feel like I am not 'allowed' to be sensitive or sentimental. I will often feel lonely and just want to have some sort of physical contact with someone - not sexual, just like a hug, or laying my head in someones lap - that i feel like I would be looked down upon if I talk about these feelings. I feel as though I can't talk to others about my feeling or my problems, and have to put up this persona of being a 'tough guy' without feelings, and just keep everything inside of me. It's hard sometimes, but I know these are all just things I am telling myself, and that I can do these things I say I can't. I just can't get over this hump and make myself do it, so I feel stuck.  "
34,"I overheard my company commander say to another officer about one of our Private fuck ups.  (in a deep southern Mississippi drawl)

""That boy.... That boy so dumb.... That boy's so dumb he'd fall into a bucket of titties and come out suckin' a dick."" "

36,"End of first date went in for the kiss and she gave me forehead. I kinda laughed and said “ok then, have a good night, I’ll call you”

The date went very well so I took it as a “take it slow” sign. So I did.  Apparently this was all a misunderstanding and she actually did want me to kiss her and my taking it slow after that had her thinking that we were just going to be friends. 

A few weeks later she took matters into her own hands and basically ran all the bases in one night. 

Had a good laugh about the “misunderstanding” after that.

Just celebrated one year with her last night and I only kissed her on the forehead all day as a sign of protest. She’s a good sport. Hahah."
37,"Putting one hand on my tush, pushing me into and close to her, one into my hair, leading me into a kiss.

Generally caressing as much of me as she can reach.

Holding me close, cheek to cheek with her, grinding her cheek against mine, giving little smooches, etc.

Grabbing my hips and moving them ""for"" me.

Signalling me to hold still and then bucking against me from below.

Telling me lovey, sweet things.

Asking me to cum inside her.

Just holding me in the afterglow and running her fingertips across my back.

Letting me doze off on top of her.
"
38,"My mother’s friend was over and sharing a box of wine. They were chatting about how one friend had a daughter, who went for a group sleepover at someone else’s house. When the mother dropped the kid off at the house, only the father was there. They were both aghast at this, insinuating he must be a pedophile trying to get with his daughter and her friends. There was zero reason to believe this. I confronted them about it and all they said is it was their intuition. Neither had even met the guys. Sick. "
39,"People act like I have three noses when I tell them how I have absolutely no clue how to approach women in a way that is completely ""up to code"" and won't annoy or discomfort them, without just sitting back and twiddling my thumbs waiting for a woman to talk to me.

I swear, I complimented a girl's nail polish once and they acted like I was about to tear their shirts off and rape them right there. If that innocuous a comment is bad, what on earth am I supposed to do??"
40,"There's something called a Confidence Course that has various obstacles. The hardest one, at least for the folks who are scared of heights, is referred to as the [""Tough One""](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6OZ0ie7cRwo/maxresdefault.jpg). The hard part is at the very top - you have to climb that A-shaped log ladder, and lean out to grab the rope. The rope is positioned *just* beyond the point of no return - you have to lean far enough out that if you don't grab it, you *will* fall. If you were close to the ground, it'd be trivial, but the fact that you're 20 feet off the ground makes it intimidating.

I finished the course and was standing in formation, watching our meanest DI trying to coach this terrified kid through it. The kid was up there for like five minutes, literally shaking as he reached out, scared himself even more, reset, and repeated the process. The DI was at the base of the rope, being incredibly nice and calmly repeating ""You can do it. Just grab the rope. I know it's scary, but you're gonna get it.""

Unfortunately, the kid was so terrified that he projectile vomited off the tower, and the DI took a massive face shot of puke. His demeanor immediately changed for the worse.

""YOU MOTHERFUCKER I HOPE YOU FUCKING FALL OFF OF THAT GODDAMN OBSTACLE YOU FUCKING FAGGOT I WILL GET UP THERE AND PUSH YOUR FAGGOT PUSSY ASS OFF OF IT. I'M COMING FOR YOU YOU'D BETTER START NOW LET'S GO BITCH""

Hey, the kid did it 10 seconds later."

Honestly, I didn't really mind. She was super self-conscious about it, especially while we were FWBs (before getting together). I volunteered to help her apply cortisone and coconut oil after our showers. It was a sorta sweet intimate thing between us. It made her feel super vulnerable, but I was there to reassure her she was safe with me. I dunno, I saw it as a means to bring us closer. "

98,"Full credit to /u/gsnow. This comment helped me immensely when someone very close to me passed a few years ago:

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. 

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. 

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. "
99,Lol i died at the locker room boombox 
100,Killed her with the goddamned truth
101,"In boot camp, I was on fire watch one night. The drill instructor came out of the hut and started to grill me on my general orders. As he was questioning me some kid, in his sleep, screamed “fuck you faggot!”. The drill instructor then ran over to him and started screaming, “what the fuck did you say to me you little bitch!” He then noticed the kid was asleep and stormed away back to his hut. "
102,Not being able to interact with kids for fear of being labeled a predator. I was playing Mario kart on my switch on the train the other day. A kid sitting behind me was watching over my shoulder. I asked him if he wanted to give it a try and race me. His mom immediately yanked him into his seat and glowered at me.  
103,An inability to take responsibility for their own behavior.  
104,"We were dancing at a club and she pulled me closer. I went in for the kiss but she turned her head away and said ""you're too young.""

I was 26 and she was maybe 29, 30? She was cute but annoying. Probably dodged a bullet at the end of the day."
105,"Having to go out of my way to show I am not a threat. Here is an example.If I see a lost girl, which happened before, first thing I have to do is find a woman nearby and ask politely if she can help her find her mother. If I don't do that I am immediately perceived as some predator.

107,"While counting off during bed-check formation, you are supposed to sound off loudly in numerical order (1! 2! 3!). Double digit numbers with a 0 are pronounced phonetically as ""one""-zero"" .. ""two-zero"" etc, for clarity.

Given we were a large basic training platoon, it gets up to 50, again correctly pronounced as ""five-zero"". Well, Private 50, in nervous anticipation of him not fucking it up, sounds off with ""five-O (oh)!"".

The Hispanic Drill Sergeant snaps back ""Oh shit! 5-O is here, everyone get your weed out!"" while motioning for us to do push-ups. Private 5-O had to run around and make siren noises while bed-check was just a little longer that evening."
108,"\- communication issues/not being able or willing to articulate their needs or what they're feeling

\- game playing/testing

\- inability to function as their own person

I would say that these apply equally to men.

Edit: I would like to clarify that I did not mean ""game playing/testing"" the gaming sense - I don't think that gaming is a sign of immaturity at all! I meant psychological games/that thing where someone will say something but mean another thing just to see if their partner figures it out "
109,Forming close friendships.
110,"I was going to be a lawyer. I ended up finding a sales job and making 10k/mo. for a while until the company folded. I have kids but no degree and food needs to hit the table. 

I dig holes now and live with some serious regret as I look at my friends with cushy jobs making 80-150k per year while I absolutely busy my add to drag in 50-65 depending on the year. 

Stay in school. Get that degree. I still don't understand why it's so important but my lack of degree has cost me, big-time. "

115,"Yup I had an ex like this.   She’d become incredibly drunk and violent towards me.   All I could do was defend myself or worse case leave the house and stay at a hotel for the night.  Quite a few times she’d draw blood and almost break bones.   

If I grabbed her to restrain her from swinging at me, she threatened to call the police on me and claim if I bruised her arms restraining her saying she would tell the cops I was the abusive one and she was the victim.   She said it in this shit eating “Ha ha ha” tone as well to try and get a rise from me.   She’s right, I knew how the cops would operate and she’d be viewed as innocent."
116,"My wife actually asked me about this recently. Out of the blue, while texting back and forth with 3 of her friends, she asked me ""hey....how often do you just text/call your friends *just because*?""

I was sad that I knew the answer was hardly ever. Usually I will hang out with friends if we need to get something done (work on someone's truck/vehicle, fix something at someone's house, etc), but otherwise we don't really see eachother.

I have since started texting my close friends more often ""just because"". It's kind of nice to just blab with my buddies sometimes via text to vent or just catch up."
117,What if dating always feels like a chore
118,"My friend dropped out. He worked as a manager for a store for an hour making a little more than minimum wage. After about 3 years of that, he was in a really bad place mentally. He went back to community college, got a degree in a field that interested him, and his now working for a real company, making way more money, and has a much healthier life. I think he credits a lot of it to going back to school after he saw what his life would be like without the degree, because it made him care a lot more about school and his education. "
119,Easy fix. Get a home bar. Display partially full liquor bottles.
120,"This kid named Chapman dropped his helmet down the portashitter. They made him get it and called him ""Shatman"" and ""Shithead"" for the rest of the cycle."
121,"I feel like I can provide some perspective here and give you a little hope. Wall of text incoming. Apologies. I got a little carried away. 

All through high school, I was an overachiever. So much so that I graduated a year early. I was 17 when I moved into my college dorm. 

Spent a year as a psych major and then half way through my first semester as a sophomore, I got a letter telling me my parent plus loan had been declined, meaning I owed the university about 11 grand before I could enroll in the next semester. I was young and had no life experience. My parents didn’t go to college and aren’t the most responsible people in the world so they couldn’t help. I tried to withdraw, but it was past the final withdraw date so I was on the hook for the bill no matter what. On top of that, the university wouldn’t release my transcripts because I owed them directly. I work as a telemarketer making about $8 bucks an hour. I have no idea what to do. 

January comes and I get a letter telling me I have to vacate my dorm within 7 days or I’ll be forcefully removed. I panic. Move all my shit into my car and sleep there for a couple weeks. Eventually start crashing with some friends. Meet a girl and we start dating. She is the first person to ever really believe in me. She encourages me to get a second job so we can start to make a dent in this massive bill that is keeping me from finishing my degree. So I do. 

Two jobs now and still just barely making the minimum payment to keep me out of collections. Things heat up with the girl and so she moves in with me. Still working hard to get out of debt when the girl graduates and tells me she’s moving out of our college town and back to her hometown. I make the decision to follow her because I believe it is love. 

Have to give up telemarketing job (was a local company) but i can transfer locations and keep my other job and we get a roommate so it’s okay. Start looking for better jobs than fast food and find a gig at a local computer repair shop. It is here that I discover my love for technology and decide that I want a career in technology (important note: this NEVER would have happened had I not been kicked out of university. I would probably have a worthless psych degree right now). Work there for three years and FINALLY pay off the 11k debt. 

Spring 2015 (five years after being kicked out of college): Reapply to college and get denied. Turns out that when you’re staring down being homeless, your grades take a serious hit and your GPA winds up in the toilet. So I call the university and ask what my options are. They advise I retake a course I didn’t do well in at to replace the grade and raise my GPA and I take their advice. Enroll in community college. 

Fall 2015: apply to college again and get accepted with new, higher GPA. Downside: college is about an hour away now. Classes plus commute mean I can’t work full time at my current job. I get extremely lucky and find a job working from home, but from 4am to noon. 

For the next two years my life is hell. I wake up at 3:45 and work from 4 to noon. I drive an hour and am in class from around 1:30 to about 5:30. Drive home. Homework. In bed by 11p and back up at 3:45 for work. I never would have survived this part without the girl from above continuously believing in me and reminding me I can do it when I start to think I can’t (the girl, by the way, is a budgeting genius. At this point we have just purchased a house and I’m going back to college). 

December 2017: at the age of 26, I turn that girl into my wife two weeks before graduating with my bachelors degree in MIS. The first bachelors degree in my entire extended family (second, I guess, if you count my wife). 

Now I work in the IT department of a midstream natural gas company. I am very happy and I feel very successful. A lot of shit happened to keep me down, but my wife never stopped believing in me and she refused to let me give up on myself. 

The takeaway is this: shit happens. Just because you don’t follow the same path as everyone else doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. Follow your own timeline and blaze your own path. There is almost always more than one way to reach a destination. "

133,"No matter how hard I try at improving myself, being generous, helpful, and respectful, I'm not allowed to expect results because that makes me entitled, and nobody owes me anything.  I have no inherent value; I am disposable.

But the moment I want to opt out of all this and just mind my own business, then I'm irresponsible and abdicating my duty to society, depriving the world of my contribution potential."
134,I don't get why the questions asked here gets us to wallow in the worst moments in our lives. 
135,"There was a bunch of funny times, but from the top of my head, I think it was a sunday or Saturday, or holiday, and our junior Drill instructor was a big Nascar fan. 

Right after luch, He told us that he hated us because he got stuck babysitting us while the big race was on.

So he thought of something and he tilted his hat down, but we knew he was smiling. 

Then he told us to grab a ""steering wheel"" and start to do laps around the squad bay. I grabed the lid of a trashcan and other recruits grabbing whatever random item they could grab, everything from a skuz brush to a boot . The drill instructor was waving a pair of green silkies (underwear) and yelled us to go faster and faster.  He made us make car noises when we passed by him so he could get the real experience of being at the race. He triped a few us and caused a ""crash""  and waved the red guidon flag. 

A couple hours later after the squad bay was filled with puke and sweat, he pulled out a piece of paper with black and white boxes on us and told us he were done. "
136,"Well I have herpes now, so I’d say the experience was pretty rewarding."
137,"&gt; Hands were smoking after that.

138,This is without a doubt the funniest shit I have ever read 
139,"My boyfriend has had cancer twice since we’ve started dating. I took a lot of time off work to help care for him, and he often felt vulnerable or frustrated. I’m a very maternal person, so I had no issue nursing him back to health, making sure his incisions weren’t infected, helping him shower, etc. He says I helped him work through a lot of emotions. I really do think the experience made us stronger as a couple. He has to go for a CT scan and blood work multiple times a year, and I still get incredibly anxious waiting for his results. The worst part was always the uncertainty after diagnosis. He was always sent for more tests, then they would pick a date for surgery and pitch a couple tentative treatment plans to us. Those few weeks spent waiting for pathology results were always the most draining. 

Edit - I realize now I’m in the Askmen subreddit, just wanted to state that I’m not a man, but that’s my story aha. "
140,"I can already hear David Attenborough's voice

*The male, having successfully brought a female into it's den, attempts to dazzle her with its ornaments and splendor. This being one of the more attractive females means his habitat will have to be that much more impressive. Her gaze wanders and subtly scans his living quarters... she's looking for dirt or anything amiss. The male is not aware of this, and tries to distract her with his autographed Reel Big Fish poster from 1999, carefully and intentionally placed above his bed. The female is not impressed.*"

143,"What I just went through, I deleted all the apps Sunday and I'm taking a break. Although I still had a fun date wednesday. 

When you walk into your apartment drunk 3-4 times a week and the memory of your ex gfs make you sad. You can see the ghost of these women sitting on the couch, walking to the bathroom to do her make-up, putting her stuff on the same damn chair next to the dining room table. They all loved that damn chair for their shit. 

When you can't remember which is the one who hated olives, which is the one who loved olives. When you think of all the 1 and 2 night stands but you don't even remember their last names anymore, or their first names. When you can't remember which was the one who spent 6 months in spain, or 6 months in Ecuador. 

When you're laying in bed at 10:30 PM on a wednsday still drunk with your CPAP mask on as you were recently diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, and you wonder "" C was the only woman I felt comfortable telling that I had sleep apnea, she didn't mind I'd have to use my machine at night, I wish I wouldn't have fucked that one up"" 

Then you start crying because this is your life, possible alcoholic, benzo/ambien addicted 30 year old and your tears are seeping in the CPAP mask messing with the seal and causing air to leak. 

"
144,"And we also get shit on for being afraid of coming across as that. Saying ""if you don't rape anyone you won't be a rapist!"" Like yeah I'm not afraid of accidentally raping anyone, I'm afraid someone's going to think I am and I'll suffer social consequences because I'm socially awkward.   
  
And before anyone shits on me, I'm not worried about legal problems, I'm worried about being labelled a ""creep"" because it's very difficult to back yourself out of that label."
145,So I should take a break from dating before I begin dating?
146,I leant in to kiss a girl and she poked me in the eye. It was devastating. I had to go to the eye hospital.
147,I was at a work social outing and a girl turned up drunk. She slapped me and pushed me onto a couch before biting my face and grabbing my nipple so hard I screamed out in pain. There were several women who watched this and later told me she was just being affectionate. If the roles were reversed the cops would have been called and I would no longer have a job at a minimum.

I always had an excuse and she would accept it. I finally broke up with her over something really really stupid. That was about 6 months ago and I've gone through a lot of growth. I still feel bad and still have lingering feelings for her. Very recently, I asked her if she wanted to try again but she told me that she had moved on.

Opening up and allowing yourself to cry during a sad movie so she can hug you and all is well. Open up about how you miss your dead parent, that's good sharing, a bonding experience.  
But... crippling insecurities, deep rooted resentment, jealousy, the things that hurt so bad, if you have a lifetime of that bottled up, it takes a therapist to handle that well if it comes out all at once. Many girlfriends are not prepared for that.   We've learned that if we tell women what really goes on inside, we will likely be less attractive to you, and possibly drive you away. Because that really happens a lot. "

206,"&gt; How legitimate men’s problems are at best re-phrased as women’s problems, and at worst are completely disregarded as inconsequential.

I've seen this most notably in conversations about custody disparity. The inevitable stats about how men are much less likely to be awarded custody than women due to the courts systemically favoring the mother, and the immediate response is, ""Yes but do you not see that the real issue is that women are naturally seen as the caretakers in society, hence why they're given custody, and that they are the real victims here?"".

No, I'ma go ahead and say that the dude that loses his kids to every other weekend strictly controlled by a vindictive ex-spouse simply because he has a cock &amp; balls is the victim."
207,"I posted about this once before somewhere but couldn’t find it. 

For as far back as I can remember I knew this amazing girl. We will call her S.S. She was always the light in any room. She was one of those people who were so full of optimism it would make you sick. 

When she was 9 she was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Basically, her heart had become too stiff to pump blood properly.

It wasn’t long after that she had a heart transplant.  

We were best friends throughout school and eventually became lovers. She was from a very well off family from the right side of the tracks and I was this public school bum who couldn’t do anything right. None of that mattered to us so long as we had each other. 

Eventually though, they did matter. We talked about long term. Her going to college ,  me , well I had no life plans. So I decided the military was what I was going to do and as hard as it was we split things off, knowing that we would find each other again in the future. 

We didn’t lose communication though. We would talk weekly. When I was deployed, she would send me care packages. Little letters letting me know I was a good person doing a good thing. Books and candies. Eventually though, those communications became less personal and more generalized, stock. 

I found out she had met someone and was to be married soon. Being the young spoiled jerk that I was back then, I was enraged. Betrayed . I still had a passion for this girl but how could she love another?! 

I left the military and lost contact with her. I didn’t have a home, lived out of my car for about a year or so in a different state from where we grew up. 


Eventually I made it back to the area. Stopped partying so much, found a job and rented an apartment. Met a girl, had a daughter. Things didn’t pan out between me and her mom but we were still good friends and we shared custody of the little one. I never forgot about S.S., I often asked the very few mutual friends we had how she was doing. I learned she was buying a house and adopting a girl. I was so happy for her and yet so envious. Deep down though I blamed myself. I could never offer her the lifestyle to live like that. 

Then one day, out of the blue I get a text message from a number I don’t know. It was her. And just like that we were best friends again. Talking daily. Catching up. Eventually having lunch together and taking the kids on play dates. 

One night she calls me in tears. She has been holding out her health issues from me. Her body isn’t happy with her current heart anymore and she’s going through doctor after doctor and nothing is looking promising. 

She said her husband and her had discussed it and they didn’t want to hold one another back from enjoying their time to the fullest. He couldn’t handle the hospital trips and regimented health issues any longer. 
She couldn’t handle the lack of passion and spark that was no longer there. 

They stayed together for her benefit. Insurance is a bitch when you have someone else’s heart inside of you. 

We once again became lovers. It was an emotional roller coaster. There was passion and sparks, we were together non stop. Our daughter became best friends. She became best friends with my daughters mother. Everything was perfect. Until it wasn’t. 

 I eventually wanted more than she could offer. I wanted a family. I finally had my own place and an amazing job. I was going to school. I became selfish. I wanted that happily ever after that I knew she couldn’t give me. 

We would argue over it but it was never really an argument. She promised me we would be each other’s one day. She just needed to finish some treatments and the full adoption process of her little girl ( this was drawn out over years for reasons that make perfect sense if you know the story ) 

Eventually I thought I couldn’t take it any more. I wanted a family and I wanted it now. So I made the biggest mistake of my life and I left the girl who I loved more than anything in this world. 

We were both devastated but I wouldn’t budge. It’s all mine or not mine at all. We didn’t speak any more. I would hear about how she was doing from my daughters mother, the only one who knew we were lovers to begin with. She knew how broken I was over everything and other than once telling me I was a moron, stayed out of it. 

Time passed and I always wanted to reach out but I was too stubborn to do so. 

And then I got a call from her one night. She told me she was in the hospital for a treatment and she was thinking about me. She said she had plans and we would have each other again soon, if I would still love her. We talked for hours that night into the early morning. We made plans to take the kids on vacation together. Talked about our dream homes, everything. Then she had to go. They were taking her to another hospital to try a new treatment. She would call me that night. 

My phone never rang. It didn’t ring for three days. 

And then it did. 

She had passed shortly after I talked to her last. She knew it was coming but used me as an escape from reality for a few hours of happiness. 

This was several years ago. I’ve since married and had another little girl. My wife knows this story, and we have a picture of S.S. hanging in my house. I miss her often and cry more than I would admit. I was so selfish and wasted so much time when I had something so beautiful and amazing so close to me. She was always understanding and never got upset with me for my decisions which makes it harder. If she had only yelled at me once or fought me over my stupid feelings. But no, not S.S.  She cared more about my feelings than her own. "
208,We had a guy with bright red hair in basic. The drill sergeants made him the flag bearer and whenever they wanted him they would yell where is my flamer.  Another time a couple of the guys didn't shave well enough so we got smoked by our female DI who was yelling that she wants her privates shaved.

211,"US Marines, so there's some Navy jargon involved:

We had a recruit who needed glasses (called portholes) with lenses at least half an inch thick.  They made his eyes look comically large when you looked at him.  One day a drill instructor from another platoon walked by while we were standing by somewhere and saw that recruit.

""HEY PORTHOLES!""

""Yes, sir!""

""LOOK UP INTO THE SKY PORTHOLES!""

""Aye aye, sir!""

""CAN YOU SEE GOD WITH THOSE?!""

He immediately left, doing the trademarked Drill Instructor's campaign cover tilted down to conceal him laughing at his own joke, meanwhile we were all DYING laughing."

213,"Not a specific line, but an entire situation.

My bay was doing bed check, which is just us standing at attention while the drill sergeants (DS) check and make sure everything is set and do some inspections. One kid was getting looked at and uh-oh! His M4 is on Semi.

So we're all dead quiet as they grill this dude. Keep in mind its two DS that are almost always attached at the hip. Very good friends.

""Private! Why the fuck is your weapon on semi!""

Now the kid is fucking scared so he starts babbling.

""I-I don't know DS. It did it on its own.""

""It did its on its own! Oh shit! It's alive!""

The female DS slaps the weapon out of his hand. Now the issue with that is if you drop your weapon you do pushups (Drop with it!) but instead of dropping him, they drop the rest of us. Then the second DS chimes in.

""Pick up your fucking weapon, private! You just throw your weapon around and do what you want?""

He goes to pick it up and the first DS stops him.

""Don't touch it! It can fire on its own its alive!""

""Pick up your weapon you piece of shit!""

""Don't fucking touch it!""

""Pick it up!""

From there it just turns into a back and forth of making this kid pick up his weapon only to slap it out of his hands while all of us are trying to stifle our laughter as he just get a fucked with for the next ten minutes."

I feel bad for her because she says that she only has about $500 to live off of per month. However, she recently sent me a picture of one of her purchases. 

It was a fucking MIB copy of Luigi's Mansion for game cube that she bought for $100+ online. 

This person, who struggles with finances is buying fucking vintage video-games to not play or even open them.

238,"Women really, really don't appreciate how tough it is for a guy trying to date women respectfully without hurting anyone. It is wildly unclear where the line is between being assertive and going too far, because it varies from woman to woman and *they won't tell you or give you any clear indication.* 

I've been in so many dating situations where it felt like time to make a move but I still wasn't sure, she wasn't doing anything but expecting me to read her mind, and I just went, ""screw it, I really hope she's ok with this and I'm not misreading her signals.""

352,"Comic genius and Fallujah guy was one of my DI’s.

He had many good gimmicks. Having a recruit make friends with the ghost that lived in the little gear locker (storage closet).  Needing help finding out of spay bottles where filled with Listerine or Brute aftershave via taste test at attention.  A full midnight parade for New Years, including a “ball drop” of hundreds of boot bands wrapped together.  Guy cried, he caught the tear, eats it off his hand, and says “I own your soul now.”  Guys a legend.

But this, this was his magnum opus.

Day two of bootcamp, all the DI’s start the over aggressive “abusive nick names” shtick.  Recruit overbite, recruit fattybutt, recruit too tall, typical shit.  Not very funny.  But, it’s juvenile nicknames, good enough.

He get to one and says “you piece of shit”.  Looks him up and down and whispers “You moo cow.  You’re my dickidoo” slaps his belly and walks away.

Over the next three months this guy became known as “recruit dickidoo”.  If he failed out of PT, he was forced to “graze” and fake eat grass on all fours. When drinking milk the other recruits had to thank him for giving us sustenance.  During shooting phase (gun training) the targets are black and white.  The DI took the most torn up target and we had a funeral service for “his mother”.  He had to give the eulogy.  Brutal shit.

He pushed this guy farther than anything I’ve ever seen psychologically.  I’ve been in combat.  That shit is fucked up, but it’s not lazer focused on the individual.  Tailor made hell.  Combat is general hell.  This kid kept going, kept getting better. Eventually went from, honestly, a kinda shitty whiney dude, to a top pft’r (fitness test), being clever at standing up for himself, and immune to self pity.

Graduation day comes around and in the morning we where woken up a whole graduating battalion formation.  This kid is being lead on a leash by said DI, “grazing”.  In front of the formation.IN HIS ALPHAS. (Think great suit saved for important occasions).

Fucking brutal.

He gets up, once all 450+ commanders, recruits, DI’s are all formed up.  He has tears in his eyes.  We notice the DI has tears in his eyes too.  They hug.  The DI has a random run up with a set of FULL DRESS BLUES (this it’s the pinnacle of Marine Corp uniform.  It cost 1k-1500 to do it properly). He presents it to “recruit dickidoo”.  DI hands it to him, and says “god damn, you weak mother fucker!  At least your belly fat doesn’t go past past where your DICKIDOOOOOOOOO!”

Not the dates, not the trip to Santa Cruz, not the late night talks, not the bit I described above about her eczema. It was all poof, gone. I tried helping her for a little while after but she ended up sleeping with someone else because I was nothing more than a stranger she had confused feelings about. Her memories never came back. 


Last I heard, she dropped out of college and moved far away, but I have no idea what happened after that. She ended up blocking me on facebook because I was fairly crushed by what happened and still hung up on her for a while after it all went down. I thought if I was in her shoes I'd want as much help as I can to try and recover those memories, but her philosophy was ""If I can't remember it, I can't miss it."".

I was good at math. For a short time I thought about being a math teacher. Realized that teachers make shit money and that not all their students are going to be the good students turned me off to that idea.

So I liked playing the sims and spent most my time in that game just making cool houses. So I thought being an architect would be neat. Took a residential architecture class in high school. Designed a house floor plan on paper, then in CAD, then took it into 3D and did exteriors. Cool class. So then I knew I liked design in general. Spoke to my teacher about architecture and did a little research showing it was a bit difficult to get into residential arch jobs (at the time at least, this is during the housing crash). So I looked into other design jobs. Settled on civil engineering due to job growth, pay, and that it has a wide variety of possible job types in the field. Got a degree from the big engineering school in my state.

Currently working as a civil engineer doing site design/land development work. I don't do floor plans but I do design the entire layout of streets/homes/utilities for big neighborhoods. Which is still pretty cool to me. "

367,"I agree with you 100%. Girls throw around the term creep so easily, but then still take it with weight. Minor things can get you branded a creep - I was added to a text group chat once and I didn't know a number in the group so I asked, and the girl made a big deal about how it was so creepy that I wanted to know who she was afterwards, instead of just saying she'd rather not say. 

And rape has become so blurred in today's world. You can now accidentally rape someone because they revoke consent or afterwards say they didn't want it, when in the moment they gave no signal that they didn't consent. Regret being a cause for a rape allegation is becoming much more common now.

It's a dangerous world for a sexually active man today, while rape allegations aren't false the majority of the time, there's still the risk that you'll be one of the unlucky people who gets in trouble for a ""rape"" you thought was consensual"

369,"This one really gets to me. When I was a teenager I used to work in all sorts of children's ministries and programs. Bible studies and VBS type stuff across a bunch of states and even a couple of different countries (my church back then was very missions oriented) and I was usually the guy that ran game programs and activity times with a bit of teaching here and there. 


I absolutely loved it, when you can run faster and throw farther than any of them, combined with a big booming voice, those kids would look up to you, you could try out all sorts of games and crafts, find out which age groups required more strategic games to keep occupied and which ones could spend three hours with a bag of balloons without once getting bored.
Nothing was more satisfying than seeing three dozen smiling faces all lined up after a vicious hour of getting wasted by dodgeballs.


It was fun and fulfilling.



But when I became an adult I started to get nervous around kids. Every moment in their presence was spent making sure to keep my distance and checking to ensure the parents were still in sight. I had always taken responsible precautions, but now they were taken out of fear and nervousness rather than respect and healthy caution. Horror stories and my own general mistrust of people mean that I avoid kids whenever possible.



And now I'm one of those people that sees a man who likes interacting with kids and my mind immediately goes to a dark place of suspicion and fear. I hate it."

Something I've discovered as I've gotten older is that some people just stare. When I was younger I was fat and I was convinced people stared at me and were thinking less of me because I was overweight. Now I've lost weight and I'm pretty much average--not particularly fat or thin, not tall or short, not extremely handsome but also not ugly, nothing unusual about my hairstyle or the way I dress or anything about my appearance, and I still notice people sometimes stare at me. I now think I was wrong when I thought people were staring at me because I was fat. I think people just stare because they're curious about others and not good at averting their glances."

Another drill sergeant hated people biting their finger nails and it was just unsanitary. ""Privates, look at your fingers, what do they look like? They look like five dirty little dicks. Stop putting dirty dicks into your mouth!""

386,"Once when I was living in Japan I was walking home late one night and it was freezing cold so I really wanted to get back to my apartment. I was in dress shoes so my foot steps were noisier than usual and they echoed in the narrow streets.

So I get off the subway and turn off the main road into my neighbourhood block. As I walk and turn down the alleyways to get back to my apartment the crowd of people gradually thin out to just me and one young woman. I think nothing of it and just assume she'll turn down another street.

Japanese people are slow-ass walkers and so the distance between me and her is closing. I'm almost home and just have one more tiny street to turn down but wouldn't you know it she turns down the same street. Immediately I'm filled with dread. I thought to myself ""If I turn down this alleyway and follow I'm going to freak this poor girl out!"" so I slow down considerably and try to increase the distance between us but she slows down to almost a crawl. 

She obviously knows she's being followed because the only noise in the street is the sound of footsteps. I'm like 30 metres from my apartment. My eye is on the prize, I'm freezing my ass off but I don't want to follow and I don't want to pass her so I stop. She's walking so slow now I think that she's scared and going into fight or flight mode. She turns her head to look at me.....turns out it was my downstairs neighbour and we both arrived at our apartment complex at the same time.

Her shoulders sunk, she smiled and then muttered to herself in Japanese as she recognised me ""oh its the white guy, 😂""  bobbed her head at me then went inside.

When I went to call him, the thought of ""just man up and deal with this shit, don't bother other people with it"" was all I could think of.

412,"Vaguely similar: I was at an NCO school, and I was addicted to salted in-the-shell peanuts at the time. Always had a bag  around. We had room inspections every morning, after PT, four-man room. (They were mostly a formality; you had to really mess up to get in trouble.) For some reason one morning, I decided to put a peanut in my locker display; I have no earthly idea why. We got written up because our locker displays weren't all the same. From that day until the end of the course, we each had a peanut in our locker display, making very sure that they were all identical. We put them in a different place every day. The cadre got a kick out of figuring out where they were. For the last day, we had them in our mouths, and produced them when we were asked where they were. "
413,"Because we don't get emotional support. We're told we have to take care of our shit on our own. ""Man up"" and all that.

If he needs some space, then that's something you need to respect. Let him deal with his problems on his own - when he feels like he's either ready to talk, or stumped and in need of help, he'll come to you."

418,"Honestly, only thing that comes to mind is the complete opposite of your question. It deeply bothers me when they *don't* do *anything* \- some women just lay there with their legs open, expecting I do all the work. Weird kinks I can totally understand, but lack of enthusiasm during sex is a big no-no in my book.

That, and not communicating."
419,"No not necessarily. So for example. An ex of mine knew I liked video games and nerdy stuff. But rather than ask about it she got me craft beer mugs. Which she loves craft beer. I don't mind but I'm not obsessed like she was.

Another gift she gave me a gift card for a massage at a place by her house. Sure a massage is nice, but she went there all the time and I never went.. so it just seemed odd.

Never got me something I clearly liked.

And to clarify, I knew she liked bath bombs, so I got her those, and I knew she liked craft beer so I went out of state to get ones she never had. I got what she wanted and not something I like, nerdy/games"
420,Well spit my dip. 
421,"Well until last weekend I hadn't ever felt wanted before. Went out with a few friends to our favorite bar. This is the first time since I added some jewelry to my style and was feeling really confident. 

Well anyway this bar is a very busy bar. My friend sees a girl he knows so we hangout with her and her buddies. Next thing you know she's dancing next to me. We match rhythms and then she starts grinding on me. Telling my friends she wants to fuck and all. 
I felt like she was too drunk though so I didn't want to pursue further. Really didnt want anything to happen.

But it was nice to feel wanted for the first real time. "
422,"There was one recruit who was a white guy with the last name “Black” and another recruit who was a black guy with the last name “Dixon”- the Drill instructor came out staring at his clipboard obviously looking for recruit Black and said, “Who the fuck is Black?” Recruit Dixon replies, “This recruit, sir.” The Drill instructor looks up and says, “Not you, ya fuckin black retard!

She took a library job closer to home and then ?

After that I started to get more in touch with my sensible side and I can only say that these women have changed my life for the better.

If you can, try to start small. Talk with a trusted friend and you will see how no harm will be done, people will look upwards as you are confident enough to show a more sensible side!"

442,I had consensual sex with a co-worker several times. She told my boss I have taken advantage of her over a month after our last hook up. I instantly lost my job and spent a large amount of cash on a lawyer. She never went to the cops and I still don't know why she did it besides that I got cold feet because we worked together and  ended the sex. I fear ever having consensual sex now. Allegations even with absolutley no merit can ruin you life. Seriously you have to trust who you have sex with. 
443,"I had a drill sergeant who was only a part time DS, and a part time actor. He talked in a super hero voice and was actually really great.

I still feel like an absolute asshole for breaking her heart even though she did some crazy stuff."

450,"Hiking or anything outdoorsy. If it goes well, awesome. If not, you're stuck committing to an activity with someone who sucks at being a person and/or isn't into you.

Worst date of my life so far was a hiking date. I've had disastrous coffee dates that went better than that one."
451,"No one's really ever made insane advances towards me, but I had a friend who I hung out with even after she confessed feelings for me and I turned her down. One random day I was gonna hang out with her and I hugged her, and she held the hug for longer than usual, looked at me for a minute, and said something to the effect of ""I don't know what cologne you're wearing but you can't wear it anymore because now all I can think about is making out with you""

454,"As a straight white male, it seems like the push toward empowering minorities sometimes journeys into straight discrimination. 

I've applied for jobs and RFPs where people will flat out say ""we prefer to hire people of color or women"". I get their intent, but it kind of comes off as saying they don't want to hire me because of my gender and color of my skin. 

You can't do much to talk about it because then you get a backlash of people saying how entitled I am and how ""my people"" have so much power etc etc. At the end of the day I'm just a regular dude who wants to get by. I don't have millions of dollars or strong political power. I'm just another douchebag with three pairs of dockers. "

This discovery was purely accidental and was the result of eating a philly cheese steak and then getting super gassy mid sex. I was clenching to hold it back but she wanted me to thrust harder because she didn't know what I was trying to hold back. Every thrust released an enormous fart. Since I knew she was close I just kept on pushing through it even though my ass would not stop. She went from being close to finishing to absolutely dying laughing with the mood totally killed for her. And I discovered that making her laugh causes contractions that damned near push me out."

Career wise, I'm a business consultant and also have a small startup for a few passion projects.

Dropping out of college was the single best thing I've done in years.

*However*, it's important to note that I realized college wasn't getting me anywhere I wanted to be, nor help me become the man I truly am.

You're the only one that can judge if college is right for you or not. What worked for me, may not work for you."

481,"We were together for 3 years. Good years too, but we both struggled to find any lasting work. So we were planning to move to a completely different state. At the very last minute I get a job offer for a very lasting career with alot of opportunities for me, and we delay. She went on a holiday out of state, and I get a message at 11;30 at night that she was going to be moving there.

She came back, spent 2 weeks with me at home and moves, convinced me to do distance. I get a message 5 days after she left saying that she didn’t really think it was going to work, even with me willing to travel to see her. One month later she was in a relationship with her roommate. I exploded emotionally, completely fell apart. I understood why she moved, it was better for her study and work, but I felt so betrayed by the rest. 

I wallowed for a month or so, on seeing her dating that guy, something clicked for me, I devoted myself to being a better person. I started going to gym every day, picked up drumming and various other hobbies, being more social. I also reallsed that when I was thinking about her that I was glossing over all the bad stuff, she wasn’t perfect, she was a person, she had flaws and she did some pretty shitty stuff with the breakup. 

Well 8 months on I still miss her sometimes, but I met someone recently and I hope that this goes somewhere. But I am a better person now. Just try to remember that you might not necessarily miss her, you miss her memory. "

483,"Not exactly this question, but pretty close. My girlfriend wanted a makeup vanity for Valentine's Day. I made it a bit extravagant and ridiculous. Definitely over the top.

I spent a few days searching around, finding a desk, drawers, mirror and shelves.

Yet the complete and utter lack of women who are willing, able, or looking to be a traditional woman who will cook clean and take up traditional feminine roles. As man who has a good career going I find myself not only taking care of the traditionally masculine roles in a relationship but I am also doing all the traditionally feminine roles too. I pay the majority of the bills while doing the majority of the food shopping, cooking, and cleaning just as much.

Whenever I saw my girlfriend turn off a light, I'd come up behind her and give her a huge kiss and tell her she is beautiful and amazing. I would then give her a Hershey's kiss.

I did this for over a month before my roommate caught on and blabbed to her that I was conditioning her.

She was not very happy. After she calmed down and said she forgave me, I could not help myself.

I'd get ridiculously insecure if I saw her so much as talking to another guy.

It's one thing to want a relationship. It's something entirely different to be afraid to be alone. If you ever identify that fear in yourself, that is exactly the time you need to take some time to figure out who you are when you're not chasing love. As long as you're afraid to be alone, you will be desperate, you will try too hard (which will show), and worst of all, you will not know when it is time to leave an abusive relationship."

We were just sitting on the couch chatting after dinner, and our spouses came up in conversation.  He was talking about his trials and tribulations, and I the same, mentioning that we've been trying polyamory on and off.  As though that were some kind of green light, my coworker, who not moments before, was discussing his girlfriend, said ""Wait, so your partner would be fine if I kissed you right now?"" ...and in the middle of me answering, yes, but that I wouldn't be, he leaned in for some kind of intimate kissy-groppy thing.  

I cringed as low into the couch as I could possibly go, managed to stutter out ""Please, DON'T"" through my surprise, and then had to ask him to leave.  

He told me before he left that he's cheated on his girlfriend twice, but he just doesn't tell her about it.  The next day, he apologized to me on behalf of my partner, and then thanked me for 'keeping him in line with his missus' ...without ever apologizing for invading my personal space. 

So work's been awkward lately.  From the other side of the spectrum, that's the worst near kiss that I've had lately.  "

529,"Just be prepared for that second wave. A lot of guys I know get over girls seemingly quick. But usually after a few weeks they start missing the girl and at that point the girl is usually past the point of caring.
