0,I literally rub my own cum all on my face
1,"I work abs on my lift days (every other day).  I mainly stick to obliques since I focus on core stuff in between sets.

I wanted to avoid the turtle shell abs which is why I focus on obliques more.

2,Edit out the asian stuff bro
3,"&gt;but my girlfriend absolutely gets too wet and even she says that she loses feeling due to a total lack of friction.

Is different than

&gt;Men of Reddit, how do you deal with a lover that gets too wet/lubricated during intercourse, to the extent that you eventually lose meaningful stimulation?

In one instance the woman loses sensation. In OP's situation *he* lost sensation."
4,"because male and female attraction isn't the same. there are reasons why there are no female-oriented strip clubs, why ""random vag pics"" aren't a thing, why women have a problem with porn that's made for men, why men and women have different fashions, why omegle is full of dicks and not tits, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to treat women like men, I'd just straight-up ask them if they wanted to bang. It's completely unhelpful. There is a middle ground between ""men and women are literally exactly the same"" and ""women are objects to be owned and used"".

&amp;#x200B;

A better phrase would be, ""women want you to like them for who they are"", or ""they want to have an actual connection, not just be used for sex, unless they only want sex"". Maybe even ""it's your job to figure out what each individual woman wants"". Something a little more helpful. ""Treat them like people"" is really passive-aggressive and serves mainly to boost the commenter's own ego by virtue signaling. It implies the asker doesn't already do that, and the answer-er is therefore a better person because he does not do that. It's dumb."
5,"Ugh this internet joke where you try to say someone who avoids looking at dicks because they're gay is old enough to rent a car.

I dont like masturbating to dicks, I like masturbating to chicks.

Somehow you think that's gay.

You're all turned around.

If you like masturbating to dicks, that makes you gay, like very literally."
6,"That women love relationships, not men."
7,Lick on these nuts and duck a diiiick!
8,"Yeah, but random stuff in the hallway is different than a neat drawer. If you refer to it as the guest drawer, you're at least bi in my head."
9,Someone call the police on this fucking miscreant!
10,"Let me guess, you have 10 pieces of clothing in your closet which are not yours?"
11,"The large population definitely means people have more experiences with Indians than with most other groups, both negative and positive. Still, I find it unfair at how Indians get uniquely labeled as ""creepy"" or ""misogynist"", when it is far from the only country with the problem being this serious (and it is indeed serious). I haven't heard of Americans, Europeans, Africans, Middle Easterners, East Asians, etc get called ""creepy"", ""rapey"", ""misogynist"" as a group."
12,Come to America and donâ€™t tip? Expect trash service. If you come to this country it is your responsibility you cheap asshole 
13,What the hell is sexual anxiety?
