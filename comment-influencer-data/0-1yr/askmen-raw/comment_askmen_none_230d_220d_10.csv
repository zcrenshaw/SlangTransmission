0,"Went on a date with a girl I met at a GED practice test, we exchanged numbers and met up the next day. The date went really well and I had let her wear one of my favorite jackets because it was cold out. I had just started a new job the day after our date so I didn't text her all day because I was in training. When I got off work I checked my phone to find out she had burnt my favorite jacket because I hadn't texted back. Hell no"
1,"My roommate had a tinder girl over one night. They had just finished a movie, which as well all know is a pivotal point on a tinder date (are you staying over or leaving). I was loving every second as the awkward tension rose, then she suggests we watch funny YouTube videos. I sat down to join them. She starts slowly typing in letter by letter A-N-I-M-A-L-S (space) G-ET-T-I-N-G (space) H-I-T (space) B-Y (space) C-A-R-S... my roommate and I looked at each other expecting that to be the punchline to an awkward joke. Nope. She flips on Russian dashcam videos of moose getting plowed by cars, and she’s cracking up while she commentates the collisions. I quickly text my roommate “what the fuck is going on”. He responds “idk but make her leave.” So I casually said to her “let me choose the next video since I know what you like now”. She says, “no one more, just one more.” (I couldn’t snatch the remote from her because she was sitting in another chair). She types in H-U-M-A-N-S (space) G-E-T-T-I-N-G (space) H-I-T (space) B-Y (space) C-A-R-S. And before we knew it we were watching a top 40 countdown of pedestrians getting violently hit by cars. I politely bailed (didn’t want her to kill me) and said “it was nice meeting you ______, and I’m sure I’ll see you again soon.” I gave my roommate a smirk, and locked myself and our dog in my room. They keep watching videos and I overhear a potato chip  bag aggressively crinkling and I overhear her say “huh, well I guess kissing isn’t your forte HAHAHAHA.” My roommate was pounding sour cream and onion chips so they wouldn’t have to kiss goodbye. With that I peacefully went to sleep knowing that was the most awkward date I’ve ever been a part of. "
2,That my dad took the long way when he'd take me back to my mom's so we'd have more time together. 
3,"I don’t remember ever buying a wallet, It just showed up when I hit puberty. "
4,If it's work clothes? Immediately. 
5,I feel safe when I can feel titties in my back
6,"Yep,  met a girl at a bar when I was in my early 20s. Really hot. We had a one night stand. I called her a couple times after that but she never answered or returned my calls so I stopped trying. About a  week after the one night stand,  I came home to a teddy bear on my porch. No note or anything. A couple days after that,  flowers. Still no note. Neither my roommate nor I could figure out who it was meant for or who was leaving them.  A few days after that another teddy bear, but this time it was on my bed. I asked my roommate and he swore he had no idea how it got there. I really thought he was fucking with me.  But the following week,  he went out of town to see his mom across the country.  And I came home to flower pedals all over my bed and candles lit. Really fucking scared me.  I searched the house. Couldn't find anybody or how someone might have gotten in without a key. The very next day,  I was leaving for the day but as I pulled down the street,  I felt like I should go back. I pulled up and saw the last  couple seconds of my automatic garage door closing. I ran into my house,  half terrified, half on an adrenaline rush,  yelling, I know you're in here! I ran right up to my room and saw a dozen roses dropped on the floor. I found her in my closet. Crying, repeating,  I'm sorry,  I'm sorry. I was stunned. I just told her to leave. No idea whatever happened to her but I never saw her again. "
7,"Went on a couple dates with this girl. She was nice, pretty, funny, smart. 

One night I got too drunk with coworkers and long story short ended up in bed with a concussion for a few days. A couple days into my sentence, she comes by with soup and to see if I'm okay. I thought that was nice, but I still wasn't feeling up for much. I thanked her for the soup but told her I was going to go back to sleep. She said no problem.

I hear her walk out, open the front door, close the front door. But something didn't seem right. I felt a .. presence. I went back to scrolling Reddit on my phone before going back to my nap. About 5 minutes later she comes around the corner. She said she pretended to leave but then stayed to see if I was lying about being sick. 

There were a couple other weird things that I had brushed off, but that was the last straw for me with her. The soup was good, though."
8,I hate how male scents are in general pretty dull. Boyyyyyyyy I love my apartment smelling like ocean breeze candles and my soaps being all lavender flower shit. 
9,I tried this sugar scrub shit once and every time I shower I think about my inferior bar of soap and it’s endless disappointment 
10,Yep. She started off by telling me how her ex had a thin dick which she couldn't feel inside her at all. Then she admitted she's still seeing him. Wtf. 
11,Being little spoon
12,"If you have never slept on a pregnancy pillow, you are missing out. I am talking about the kind that is shaped like a C and is body length. Part goes under your head (side sleeper) and the other side between your legs/knees. Slept like a champ with it until the wife threw it away because I quit being the big spoon once I experienced greatness."
13,"Remember that ""permanent record"" everyone told you all the bad shit you did would go on when you're in high school?  Well unless you actually went to jail for something then big fucking deal."
14,"Yes. This girl I worked with in high school. We both worked at a local pizza place. She was super pretty, but absolutely had this ""I'm bat shit insane"" vibe. She once lunged at a group of us with a butcher's knife, and at the last second stopped and started laughing like it was a great joke. I can't begin to describe the kinda heebie jeebie vibes she gave off all the time."
15,"Never had any issues with anger. I see a lot of guys who struggle with short tempers, including my father. Drama rolls off me like water on wax, and I’m quite proud of that. "
16,"I’m a Girl Scout.  

No, seriously.  Registered parent volunteers are automatically made a Girl Scout.  So...... yeah.  I am what I am.  "
17,oh damn wtf
18,"There was this girl I hooked up with kinda regularly first semester freshmen year of college. She lived in the same building as me.

She was very attractive.

She told me that she knew precisely how she would die (she would crash her car into a telephone pole in the rain). She refused to take prescribed medication because it was a ""government plot to make her less spiritually creative"". 

Told me that a psychic had told her that she would cheat on a man with my name and leave him heartbroken.

She found my mom on Facebook and told her a bunch of lies. Did the same thing to my sister.

She hooked up with my roommate, but said it didn't count as sex because ""his soul is on a different levels than ours"". 

When I said I wasn't going to see her anymore, she accused me of sexual assault. 

She still randomly texts me sometimes about my ""beautiful soul"" and how I'm a perfect person, years after I last saw her. "
19,"Margaritas. I've had guys say it's for women but that's their loss. 

I'm not missing $5 strawberry margaritas on margarita Monday. "
20,"&gt;Plus she wears those shoes with individual toes.

There's the red flag, right there."
21,Dog was curled up next to me while I was playing video games last night.  The wife walked into the room and he went and laid next to her....
22,"need one that's slim and sturdy and fits bills and cards, I guess. That's a tall order."
23,Sewing! My wife likes to joke that I'm her personal seamstress
24,"As a not native English speaker, I had never seen the word ""lung"" used as a verb, and I thought you might have mispelled another word, made a typo or something. 

So, I googled and found the word ""to lunge"" and learned the meaning and use of it. 

Thank you for a good story and for a new word in my vocabulary. "
25,Nothing makes me want to smile less than being asked to smile. 
26,"Absolutely. I work with her and she has no boundaries. She just came up to me once and rubbed my nipples in front of everyone. Constantly talks about sex with me unprompted. Describes her ""ideal man"" by just looking at me and listing off my physical features. Makes everyone feel pretty uncomfortable. Plus she wears those shoes with individual toes. She's just really off-putting. The tragedy is that she's incredibly attractive. "
27,"All the shit you go through when you're a teenager, all the insecurity and worrying and whatever, everyone your age is also going through exactly the same shit and you're all just covering it up."
28,"I had a guy show up to a coffee date in a full three piece suit and top hat once. He even had a pocket watch. He said he felt he was born in the wrong era and “identified with a more elegant time”. When I asked questions about things like lifestyle preferences in dating, he was insistent that his “intentions were genuine” and he was always “a perfect gentleman” who liked to go about “courting the old fashioned way”. He didn’t actually answer any of my questions. He forgot my name twice so he guessed. 

I paid for my own coffee and very politely declined his offer to “escort me to my next destination”. 

Yes, it was tinder, and his bio was shockingly normal."
29,"Shit you just made my day. I busted my back years ago. My wife is college educated and has a solid career path. It seemed logical that I take on the role of stay at home dad. Bc I'm home, I learned to cook. I have dinner ready must night. I enjoy it. I do house work. I don't enjoy that. But, I've had to learn to sew by hand and by machine bc my boys are rough on clothes (so am I). Sometimes my wife's work pants need hemmed bc she's a lil short. I enjoy growing flowers and vegetables in the yard during the summer. I use my wife's face creams so I don't look old.  I'll use her shampoo bc it smells better. I no longer drink but was always envious about how great the ""feminine"" drinks taste. Freaking strawberry daquari's are great. 
  I wear flannels and ripped up jeans (I was a 90s teen, it stuck). I have a big badass beard. I play guitar and ride a motorcycle. "
30,"I found someone back in the days of match.com SF when it was new. She was incredibly perfect and sweet...she ran into me when she was out another night when I was playing a show and I sang directly to her, she danced up to the stage like something out of a Rom Com, she was sweet and adorable and funny and sexy. I didn’t see her after the show but messaged her. 

Turns out she was married with 3 kids. "
31,"One of the main reasons my dad was so angry and hair-trigger tempered all the time was because money was tighter than he often let on and his employment was inconsistent.

I mean, part of it was because he’s kind of an ass, but that was a big part of it too."
32,"What kid parties did you go to? Every kid party I hosted and attended as a child like birthday parties and such the parents of the party guest kids would just drop the kids off and come back to pick them up at the designated time the party was over. 
Never did parents stick around to be with the other parents... my parents had their own friends and their own parties for adult socializing. 
This was in the late 90s."
33,I feel sorry for you guys’ YouTube history-algorithm-thingy. Plus your FBI against was probably like wtf 
34,"I met a man at a bar and for the second time in my life I worked up the courage to hand him my number as my friends and I left. A few days later he messages me and we start chatting and agree to go on a date later in the week. 

I received a FB friend request from a woman that I didn't know, but her profile indicated that the guy was a mutual friend of ours. I then recieved a message from the mysterious woman, basically saying she was his girlfriend and I needed to cut contact with him. Turns out he had broken up with her a couple of days before we met each other at the bar, and she didn't want the relationship to end. I spoke with him about it, and he assured me thay he was single and I believed him. Decided to go on the date. 

Date night comes, and I'm nervous. He's very sweet, calm, we had a great dinner and a couple of drinks, talked for a couple of hours. The restuarant we had chosen was busy that night, but we weren't bothered by the people squeezing by our small table while we ate. We're laughing, agree that we want to keep the night going and decide we're going to go to a local barcade. As we're leaving, I'm talking about something and I notice his demeanor change from jovial to reserved. I asked him what was wrong when we got outside and he told me i needed to leave, he had spotted his ex at the bar as we were walking out. 

I left, quickly. What was a nice night, was suddenly cold and awkward and felt wrong. Turns  out his ex had logged into his FB account and read our messages about where we were going for our date, followed us there, and watched us for God knows how long. 

This man and I had a sweet bond, and I have a stubborn streak. I refused to allow someone else to dictate whom I was going to date, especially after shit started getting weird. 

For the next four months, we would experience stalking, threats, harassment, etc. Accessed his apple account and had my number blocked multiple times. She called and texted me hundreds of times (sometimes in one night), and would use a different number every time I blocked a new one. I eventually had to get my number changed. She peed on and keyed my car, and followed me to the bar where he worked, threatening to attack me (I had to be escorted to my car by police that night). She posted my contact info and picture to reddit. She had her friends reach out to me, trying to contact me by any means possible. Eventually, she claimed that my (at the time) boyfriend had hit her, and he spent a weekend in jail for the accusation. I tried, twice, to get restraining orders for myself against her, both of which were denied by the judge because she hadn't actually attacked me. 

It was insane. It felt like it wasn't real, and her tenacity in making our lives hell was incredible. 

Shalysa, I know you use reddit, and I wouldnt be surprised if you read this comment. The entire time you made my life hell, I pitied you. You have so much energy that could be channeled into helping others, but you chose to be vile and evil, and I sincerely hope you received professional help for your issues. Take care."
35,"As soon as I get home, I go straight to my room to get changed. I really hate wearing ""outdoor"" clothes inside for some reason. If it's cold I'll always be in a onesie at home, if not I just wear shorts."
36,"Hint about how you have a girlfriend and really like her. Like ""You seen Glass yet? Me and my girlfriend want to see it this weekend."" or ""Man I'm tired, so glad my girlfriend will pick me up later."". Don't make it annoyingly often though."
37,That I'm seventeen days smoke free after a pack a day habit for twenty five years. 
38,"My prom date from senior year of high school. She was already graduated and 20 years old, but super hot so I was stoked she agreed to go with me. I started bringing her to some parties with me only to find out that once she drank, she turned into an absolute psychopath. As I quickly realized it was time to take her home, my buddies at the door muttered something along the lines of her not handling her booze, so her instant reaction was to spin around and double fishhook my friends mouth into the wall, and then throw a punch at my other friend. Ignoring this due to said hotness I still brought her to prom, and as we sat down to eat she reaches up her dress and pulls out a flask. Needless to say my night was spent playing damage control. She asked if we were going to the after party and I said “no you’re going home” never spoke again. So yeah"
39,"Most of your friends will be temporary and that's ok. Not every friendship needs to be ""I'll love you to the end."" Some of them are just for a few months. Seasons of your life "
40,"It's not that my dad was naturally uncool/cringy, or that he wasn't aware that he was uncool/cringy, it's that he was a mixture of literally not caring what these dumb kids think and at times going out of his way to make things cringy or uncomfortable."
41,"Oh yes.  Let me tell you the tale.

In my college days there was a young woman from Ukraine who attended our small school of &lt;1000 people.  Unbelievably attractive, extremely athletic, and made her interest fairly well known without much delay.  We hung out for some months before things got bedroom-y.

In my dorm, on the bed, clothes coming off, everythings good.  Shes on top and, as one does when kissing, my eyes are closed.  She suddenly stops and I feel something at my neck.

Its a kitchen knife.  She had taken one from the kitchen when she went to use the bathroom and somehow hidden it. I freeze, she tells me to ""trust her"".  I informed her that if she cut my throat I'd do my damnedest to make sure she goes down with me.  Five solid seconds pass, and she removes the knife and goes to resume making out.  

I politely ask her to leave.  She gets upset, cant understand why I want her out.  Leaves after another solid minute of arguing, stabbing the knife into the cheap ass drywall on the way out.

The next day she sets a car on fire.  Cops go to her room, and a grappling hook and LOTS of lye are found in her possession.   "
42,Your user name and this question confuses me.
43,Holy shit that’s a scary one. What happens to these people to make them think this is ok??
44,"In a slightly more positive way, I had an incredibly dazzling date with a lady who kept using these small mannerisms that really got me going. Her eyes crinkled when she smiled, she held her pinky out, she slightly covered her mouth when she laughed. It felt like I was in a Disney movie."
45,"wtf you is talkin about i been using the same POS for 20 years i don't even know where i got it, just appeared to me"
46,Was it my boy skinny penis? 
47,"I dated a girl who confessed her love and  proposed. During our second date!

Thought that's funny until, few months  later, she secretly moved. She was living 100km away. Now she lives on my street, one block down from my place.

Not funny"
48,"As an average man, no one speaks to me unless they have a specific purpose. 

Pretty much ever.

"
49,"I have a friend that was basically assaulted by a hook-up. Not badly though so it's more funny, but still creepy.

Backstory, he's a strength and conditioning coach and she's an instagram fitness girl. So already it's a match made in heaven. Anyway they go on a date, afterwards they're at his place hooking up. She bites his lip pretty hard to the point where he asks her to stop because it's a distraction. So that stops for maybe a minute before she's back to it and drawing blood. So he has to stop and tell her that really hurts. She slaps him across the face and tells him to ""Stop being a bitch"". She licks the blood off and I guess they kept getting after it.

"
50,"I’ve good spatial awareness like remembering the routes or directions to a place. I can easily make my own mental google maps while I’m traveling to a new place.
If I park my car in the basement of a big mall and go up and do some shopping for an hour or so, I could easily tell which way my car is facing relative to me. Like, my mind takes note of all the directions I take from a given point, like north east west south. I’d be subconsciously taking a mental note of almost everything in the surroundings.
I sometimes feel that it’s a useless “skill” or “talent”, sometimes I just get a kick out of it. "
51,Told mom I needed a wallet. She got me one I still have it over 10 years later. I consider it my first wallet but it’s really just my first non Velcro wallet
52,"Yep, two times off the top of my head:


1) Girl was on a dating app and we started chatting back and forth. Asked if we could take it to text and so I did. Then the insecurities and constant texting started. Immediately asked me to go to church with her, she needed a boyfriend, she is attractive and no one wants to be with her. I think I responded about 5 times to her 30 or so messages in the span of a few minutes. I told her that maybe it won't work out between us and then I just quit responding. Eventually she quit messaging my phone and went back to the app. For almost a month it was a daily message of 'I'm sorry' to 'Hey, how are you?'



2) The second was an attractive, but heavily drunk girl, that I seemed to run into every weekend at a particular bar. By the time I got there at 9pm she was trashed and would immediately try to dance on me and ask me to take her home. I had no idea who this girl was and only loosely knew her name. I tried everything, pawned her off on her friends, asked other people to bail me out, and straight up told the bar. Started seeing her around at other spots and she freaked me out. Eventually she quit coming up to me but I'd see her do it to other guys from then on. I felt bad for her and was concerned for her safety. "
53,"I'm a fisherman with a beard and everything and I love taking a bath with bath bombs are a cold, stressful day of almost dying."
54,From Craigslist?!?! A BLIND DATE?! You’re lucky you didn’t end up as someone’s lampshade 
55,"Not so much creepy as... Well, you'll see. Organised a blind date off Craigslist several years ago just for fun. Date went really well, she was really, *really* attractive, we got on really well. She was completely new to the city, didn't know anyone, etc. and had moved for work.

Afterwards started texting. She then started calling me by someone else's name, insisting I was this other person. Things got even weirder, she would say some strange, completely incongruent stuff. Properly paranoid stuff, that I've only seen in a couple of people I've known.

I started to think she was legitimately schizophrenic. I was a little scared of some of the stuff she was saying, but also worried because she had no support in this new city. It was pretty hard to judge by text and email, but I think once she became lucid again, she freaked out a bit and never wanted to speak to me again.

I told her if she needed support, here's my phone number, my email address, etc. because I knew she didn't have anyone to rely on here, and I know how difficult mental health stuff is because of my own problems. But at the same time I was half hoping that she wouldn't contact me. It was an intense couple of weeks anyway, and I never heard from her again."
56,Opening up about my emotions and being vulnerable.  
57,When my boyfriend spends the night at my place and showers he uses all my soaps and whatnot and I only know this because he smells freaking amazing
58,I use sweats as a sign that I’m “done” for the day. Single dad so when I get home there’s shit to do. I found if I changed as soon as I got home that everything felt like a chore so as much as it sucks the work stuff stays on until everything is finished. I found I stay in the same “get shit done” mindset. It helps that I’m a welder so while I’m not clean I’m clean adjacent.
59,"I have been getting into gardening lately and I was telling my mom about a new flower I got last weekend and she said ""thats weird, it should be your sister that is into that not you"" 

And I got super offended and was like ""why, because im not a girl"" and we got into a small argument as I watched her back track. 

Gardening helps my anxiety and depression. I like the predictability and how easy but pretty it is. But then again, I cant talk to my mom about anxiety and depression either. 

I have always been more hands on than my sister, from woodworking, car maintenance, and home repair stuff, to more stereotypically feminine things like cooking, sewing, painting, and now gardening. 

I dont give a fuck about societal gender norms, I will do what I want if it seems fun, and will express my masculinity however I see fit. 

Oh, also, sucking dick sometimes is another answer of mine to OPs question. "
60,"If you don't speak english natively it might be worth mentioning that it is pronounced differently.  Lung (the part of your body you breath with) rhymes with ""young"".  However lunge rhymes with sponge.

&amp;#x200B;

Your english is great by the way."
61,"That our parents are just humans with erratic feelings, emotions, faults, sexual desires etc. Not these “know all” beings we see them as when we are kids. They are kinda just going through the motions of life too, not always as in control as we thought. But I mean, that really does depend on the parent."
62,"Hot Chinese gal shows up for our first date with multiple gifts for me and finished off the evening telling me how many of my babies she wanted to have and how we should start coming up with names. 

Nope."
63,"I arrived at a girls house to pick her up. This was about 10 years ago. Her mother is on the couch smoking a huge bong, with her 2 year old on her lap.  The mother and her start arguing about whose weed she is smoking. On the date she proceeds to get about 5 calls from her mom asking where is her weed.  "
64,Ask your girlfriend to come by and fuck her right there and then in front of your coworker 
65,"""his soul is on a different level than ours""

This is super weird and funny at the same time.
"
66,"*cough* yes it's for my wife, I have a bottle of pure diesel to drunk in my lifted truck /s"
67,"I’m very easy to please, I’m basically a dog. Just look at me and I’m happy"
68,Yes. And if I'm alone I'm probably nude.
69,"I love that I am slowly coming out of my depression, that really hit me hard in the fall. Still got a lot of work, but I know I can do it. 🙂"
70,"| Ignoring this due to said hotness

Famous last words of every man"
71,Movies. Definitely movies. 
72,"First tinder date...she showed up 45min late to the restaurant. Why the fuck did I even wait?? She shows up, we have a good time, tells me she loves me as we walk out of the restaurant to leave.

Nah."
73,"I have resting depressed face I guess, cause people often come up to me asking if I'm alright. Like no, I'm not, but my face isn't the problem here.

I'll decide for myself if I want to smile or not. "
74,"lol! It was actually about an hour. Maybe I’m too patient! He was very attractive physically, he rode a bike to get to the date, and he paid in silver dollars. I truly wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t been there. My friends and I dubbed him Mr, Monopoly."
75,"I dated a girl that was staggeringly attractive but had some, uh, issues.  After I broke up with her and went basically NC, a few months passed and I started seeing someone else.  

We were across the street hanging out with the neighbors and I happened to run home to grab something and she was IN MY HOUSE.  

It was late and I’m still not sure how I didn’t see her car, she must have parked a few doors down. 

She was in pajamas and apparently planning to stay the night.  I told her she absolutely had to go or I was calling the cops.  She cried and called me a bunch of names but did leave peacefully otherwise. 

Shortly after that I moved but I still get queasy thinking about it.  

I can’t imagine what would have happened if it had been the girl I was seeing that went back across the street first.  
"
76,"About two to three weeks ago, my mom took the longest curly fry of my life off my plate. I still haven't gotten over it to be honest.

Last week, my gym partner hit chest with another guy. I'm pretty fucking distraught. Was I just not strong enough? Is my form off? Did I not do enough reps? I didn't wanna make a post about this but it feels good to finally get it off my chest (unlike that chest day I lifted by myself)"
77,"Start bringing a Katana to work and anytime she starts talking to her unsheathe that monster and tell her you're busy studying the blade.

Start wearing fedoras to work.

Start addressing her as M'lady

Start sweating profusely. 

Only drink and drink Mountain Dew and Doritos.

If she is still interested in you... Well it's time to find a new job buddy.

But honestly, there will be no easy way without hurting her feelings.  But, she's an adult now.  It can be a good lesson that she can't always get what she wants.  "
78,"Try being a bartender in a college town. Creep central. Girls can be bigger creeps than men. They grab your arms, pecs, shoulders, ask you to fuck them and their friends. It’s super gross, especially when you are married and they are a sloppy, sweaty, drunk mess with the worst breath imaginable. "
79,She knows I have a girlfriend as she comes in to see me quite often. I think I'm just too nice and dont know how to put my foot down without shattering her ego 
80,"My dog secretly ate poo, drank a bunch of water, and barfed it up in the house hours later.  "
81,She poisoned the soup.  
82,"Years ago, my family and I were road-tripping around the Sunshine Coast on Australia Day. We were desperate for something to eat, but nothing was open because of the public holiday. The only nearby café that was open was a high tea restaurant.

No exaggeration: this is the most feminine place I have ever been to. It was a bright pink teahouse, with cosies and fancy teapots. The whole nine yards.

For context, my Mum is the only woman in the house. My Dad, my brother and I could not have been less interested in eating there. Adding to this, my brother and I were in adolescence at the time; typical arsehole teens.

But as we chose our teas, sat down with our scones and ate, we loved it. The teas were delicious and custom, the scones were perfect. Everyone started playing into the frivolity of it. Without a doubt the most enjoyable and memorable brunch I’ve had."
83,"Not my story, but a good one nonetheless: My buddy from law school is divorced and started dating again using apps (match, tinder, etc). He meets a gorgeous former college athlete who never had kids, but desperately wanted them. He tells her that he had a vasectomy after a month or so of dating. She insists she does not care and wants to be with him forever. First red flag (after a month...?) Things are fine and he’s into her as well. Fast forward 4 months. She claims to be 3 months pregnant with his child. He tells her that is impossible as he is 100% sterile. She insists. Fast forward 5 more months. The child is born looking 100% Caucasia. He’s black. She insists on a paternity test. The results confirm it is not his child. She sends him birthday photos of the kid every year..."
84,I wish your date was longer because I’d like to hear more. 
85,My bird put her head down for scritches and then bit me when i went in to scritch.
86,"27 year old single dad. I DIY and make crafts like a madman, with or without my son. I do not understand the gender-bias that this gets, especially when I'm shopping at a craft store, and many people assume I'm looking for things for my non-existent girlfriend or something."
87,"I have cats.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't change out of my clothes as soon as I get home then I'll have to lint roll the fuck out of them or wash them again. I have 6 pairs of the same shorts from Polo that are supposed to be like pyjamas but I just use them for any time I'm not at work. "
88,"This didn't happen to me, but to one of my friends. On their third date, he got some red flags from this girl. Stuff like conspiracies, talking about her past relationships alot, nothing too crazy though. 

He had decided to break things off, and tells her that he doesn't think they should see each other anymore. He feeds her the usual polite stuff that NORMAL people handle well. I mean, it was only three dates. 

Later that night, his phone blows up with texts, and this girl is screaming about how much she 'loves him' and 'how could he do this' because she has 'abandonment issues'. 

She ended this tirade by sending him photos of her bloody feet and all her toenails. Which she had ripped off. And then she blocked him. 

We are all very glad she lives in a different province now."
89,"My cats double teamed me.  One of them knocked some shit off my desk in the next room.  When I went to investigate, the other one jumped up on the counter and knocked the plate with my still hot pork chops on it, off and then both of them proceeded to run off with one.  The the fucking ass holes were doing the shitty meows wanting to know why the fuck there wasn't any food in the food bowl since it was dinner time.  Fuckers. "
90,"Posted this somewhere before, but one time I was walking around down town with my then girlfriend around the time I was a teenager. We were walking on a side walk on a busy 4 lane road, and this car is headed towards us with a guy leaning his whole torso out of the passenger window, and he throws something at us. At first I thought he was being an asshole, but then an empty wallet landed directly at my feet.

That was the first wallet I ever actually used. I kept it for years until it fell apart."
91,Damn. My dad would take the fastest way and do 20 over the limit
92,"The guy tried to trip the waitress, twice."
93,What. The. Fuck. 😂 I’m sorry to laugh but your storytelling skills are amazing. Thank you for the build up on this. Oh my god that’s insane
94,"Sweet cocktails... preferable in pink, pink things just taste best."
95,"I love it that i've finally managed to break away from my abusive now ex-girlfriend and i'm slowly gaining my self esteem back.

This Saturday was the first time in a long long while where i took a look in the mirror and said ""I love you, you handsome son of a bitch"". I truly meant it and it felt really good."
96,"Buddy's hot girlfriend (at the time) tried stabbing him with his own combat knife, not sure if that is creepy or crazy though."

On a somewhat similar note, beers made with fruit."
100,Someone did this to me in HS. Instead of an empty wallet it was a full bottle of water and it hit me in the throat. Good times
101,"We drink margaritas all the time in Texas. 
Pro Tip: Instead of getting on the rocks or frozen get a half and half. The frozen replaces the ice so it stays cold and you get more margarita. I've never been upcharged for this."
102,"I wear foundation/concealer most days as my face gets really red. It's been a great confidence boost and everyone I've mentioned it to says that they can't tell I was wearing makeup.

I also love candles."

104,Everyone say that!! It's a inside joke with a friend and now everyone hate it lmao 
105,"that most people dont know shit.

106,Thanks and thanks. 
107,"You're a decent looking dude so its not that. Women inherently want what other women want. Maybe not all of them, but a lot. I clicked on even just your reddit profile and it's all about this idea of not getting dates. You might be coming off as desperate. Confidence goes a very long way in the dating world. I am on the shy side, but nobody who meets me would ever tell me I am not confident. Stop acting like you're the one who needs to impress these women and go in with the mindset they need to impress you. "
108,Apparently flavored sparkling water. I've been asked on multiple occasions if I'm buying it for my wife or girlfriend.

113,"It wasn't really a date, but I went out for tacos and beers with a girl who psychoanalyzed me to my face including pointing out unconscious gestures and mannerisms.  

\---sorry lady I'm leaning forward with my shoulders hunched forward because i can barely hear you speak, not because I'm introverted.  "
114,"I do suppose that skin care could be considered a thing for women, but I don't care. I do that shit because with nice skin and ""the softness covering the roughness underneath"" is a great concept! Also my skin is rather sensitive to stuff, so if I don't take care of it shit doesn't feel or look very good.

My hair is something I take good care of as well. Got to use the good shit and take care of my long, blonde hair! Make it feel fluffy, smooth and smell good too. It's one of the few things I usually get compliments for. This is the reason I keep it long. It gives me positive attention.

Now, I am rather poor, so I cannot afford that stuff right now, but during the times I had a job I could spend a lot of time with it. And it does feel rather nice taking some time to take care of those things!"
115,FOUR SAMBUCAS 
116,I like to watch HGTV and drive our Honda CRV most of the time.  My wife says I'm basically a middle aged woman when you stack those two things.  
117," I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."
118,"There were so many theories. He didn’t break character once, and I was looking! I like to imagine he has a bunch of costumes and goes on dates giving people a good story. I don’t like to imagine he actually lives his life that way but, hey, it was Seattle!"
119,As a teen I cared SO MUCH about what others thought of me. It's great not giving a fuck when you're older. 
120,"I remember a comedian's bit where he says ""if I drink a smoothie, no one says a thing. But somehow, by adding alcohol to my smoothie, I become MORE of a bitch?"" "

Do you think he lost a bet?"

124,"Was laying down on the couch snuggling with my dog and he let out a toxic Silent But Deadly right near my face. I yelled and jumped up and the little shit didn’t even get up, he just turned around to look at me and wagged his tail. "
125,"A simple response of ""why?"" usually shuts them down. "

127,"One of the first girlfriends I had was pretty attractive. After a few months she started to get really clingy so I started to pull away. Then things started disappearing from my locker at school. When I asked her if she knew what happened she would deny it. I didn't believe her so I started to distance myself a bit more. Eventually I said that I wanted to break up and she snapped. She started cutting herself and threatening suicide if I didn't take her back. I started finding ground up powders and broken toothpicks in my food that I stored in my locker. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually told her parents that she was hurting herself. She got pulled out of our high school and I never heard from her again."
128,"I love that you said ""your"" FBI agent as if they're assigned specific people to monitor. That's a really funny concept :)"
129,"If she knows you have a girlfriend and is still doing this behavior then she knows what she is doing and you have to be somewhat firm the next time she touches you, puts her head on your shoulder, or any physical contact that makes you uncomfortable or that you thi k would make your GF uncomfortable by saying ""hey I dont think this behavior is appropriate for the workplace or that my GF would appreciate it."" She knows what she is doing. I have been in that boat and I made the other choice... to not say that... take it from me. I made the wrong move. "
130,"My older sister was severely handicapped her entire life. She could not sit up on her own or walk or talk and needed to be fed/changed, etc. 

By the time my wife and i met, my sister was in a nursing home as she needed 24 hour care. The first time my wife went with me to visit she sat next to my sister and held her hand. That spoke volumes to me."
131,"That your physical age has fuck all to do with your maturity as a person. That if you want to be seen and treated as an “adult”, you need to act like one. "
132,"I went on a date with a girl that at first blush was amazing and really good looking and funny, but that during the course of two dates told me that:

1. She routinely traveled for the purposes of sex with a rich ""benefactor""

2. An ex-boyfriend was in prison

3. She had in excess of 300 sexual partners and most recently sucked-off a drug dealer for cocaine 

4. She didn't want to work and wanted to travel and never have constraints

5. She did not like using protection during sex. 

The biggest mistake(s) of my life. "
133,The part where he was pounding sour cream and onion chips to avoid the goodnight kiss was genius.
134,"Tbh, this has to change. Everyone have emotions and need to vent"
135,Go buy another bottle of the good shit. Life is too short to not enjoy the little pleasures.
136,"Reading without my glasses, read this as ""tip"", reread, was sad. "
137,"Went on a second date with a dreamboat, everything was going really really well when the most beautiful woman I have ever seen enters the bar. The whole place is staring at her and I’m a little shocked when it date turns and waves her over. She sits down and introduces herself - she’s my dates ex! She lives right around the corner and he had let her know that we would be there if she wanted to stop by! They both proceeded to catch up and thoroughly ignore me - I pretended to go out for a smoke and just left. "
138,I hydrate my hair once a week with a hair mask.
139,"I'm getting tired, so style will be shite.

Met dude on OKStupid, he's new in town, and thinks I'm cute. Doesn't talk much, but is open to meeting.

I was doing this thing where I said yes to any date I was asked on, just to get out of my funk over the ex. 

So we make arrangements to grab lunch the next day. He's kind of a Cletus looking motherfuck, but whatever, I just need to get out of the house, and looks aren't everything. 

Dude rolls up in one of those older trucks, the ones with the ""extra seat"" in the cab that gives all of two square feet for the back passenger. 

It's piled with crap back there. Sleeping bag, pillow... Other random shit. Looks like he lives in his damned truck.

I weighed the possibility of getting kidnapped to be someone's sister-wife, and hop in, because fuck it, I don't give a shit about anything at that point. And I'm a little bipolar, so... We do crazy shit.

He backs up, without looking. I look. I see...

Was that a loose toilet roll, inches from my nose, kinda jammed in with everything?

You bet your ass it was. 

Dude drives like a maniac.

We did not hit anyone or anything on the two block journey to the restaurant. 

Conversation has been pretty light. Limited to, ""Jesus Christ, you drive like a maniac!""

We pull in and park. 

""You won't believe this!""

I will believe anything.

""I forgot my wallet!""

I do not believe this. Dude has EVERYTHING in his truck. 

 I say, ""No worries, I can buy you lunch, let's just go.""

He refuses. Eight times. Okay. He was gonna get a free lunch.

We walk down a few buildings to the convenience store. 

He tells me he's just moved from three provinces away. 

That explains the junk. Where's the wallet though. Did he leave it between here and Ontario? I don't want to know.

I buy two cokes, and give him one. He doesn't even want a damned cheese stick. So I don't eat either.

We go back to the truck of potential death. 

Decide to sit in the park, and drink our coke. 

He's talking. I am not talking. This is too fucking good. I spend the first twenty minutes looking around, hoping I don't see anyone I know. 

""So yeah, moved out here for work yesterday, I don't like my roommates, they're bitches, gonna be the best damned mechanic they ever saw.""

Note, small town, I fucking know the most they do at the place is fucking tire rotations. 

""You have a nice little house there, anyway, I was hoping I could find myself a nice woman to shack up with, help out, you know."" Attempted wink. 

I. Play. Dumb. ""Know what?""

He grins. 

OhGodWhy. His teeth are covered in black plaque. 

""You know. I'd eat you right.""

Can vaginas get gingivitis? 

I don't want to find out. 

I say, ""You seem nice, but I just don't feel a spark. My house isn't far, I'm gonna go. Best of luck with your roommates!""

I walk home. I'm dying, trying not to laugh when he's in earshot. I'm also hungry as fuck. There's no food at home.

I hide in my house for two hours, and walk back downtown to the restaurant. 

There is no poutine that will make up for whatever the fuck that was. 

I order one with extra cheese. 

I get a text.

""You know, if you change your mind, I'd love to move in with you.""

Cue cunky girl all alone in a diner, laughing hysterically over poutine at 2 p.m., worried Koreans whispering.

I tip 40%, and go home before someone calls the cops on me again.

Gave up dating for a year. 

The end."
140,Damn. This touches my heart
141,"Okay my dude, here's the plan: go to wherever you do your shopping and look for body washes that specifically say ""exfoliating"" or ""scrub"" etc then when ya find them pop the caps and give them all a good smell. Find one you like? Perfect. Head home and have the most relaxing shower ever, scrub all the dead skin off (you can also use this on your face 99% of the time) and afterward you will feel so baby-soft and smooth it's bloody ridiculous.

Good for your skin, and gives you that super fresh/clean look that everyone will love, but not quite be able to put a finger on why you look so good lol."

147,"Yeah it's crazy. I remember seeing people say that an ideal girl is hot but super insecure.

Now that I'm in my 30s, I can honestly say that would be horrible. You can't trust the instability of those types of personalities. Whether it ends with them stabbing you or getting fucked by random guys, either way it won't be nice."

151,She introduced me to her boyfriend at a bar. Earlier in the same day we slept together. No it was not an open relationship.
152,I feel more people should be asking questions about the onesie.
153,Not even a text back 
154,I’d make one amendment to this: don’t make your GF the reason you think it’s inappropriate. Instead of “my GF wouldn’t appreciate it” say “it makes me uncomfortable.”

157,"Well, we had been dating about 2 months and I invited him to go to a Willie Nelson concert with me. I’m a huge fan and I’d never seen him play live before. THIS guy (who is a scummy used car salesman... I know.) suddenly asked if we could stop off in a different city so he could run a car title or something to one of his associates. It was a 3 HOUR detour from the concert. He also took a call from his ex wife at some
point and had an argument with her in front of me. Yep. When we FINALY got there, I only got to watch the last 2 songs of one of my all time favorite artists because of him. 

Well, this was at a casino, so we thought that we might as well play a little since we missed the whole fucking show. The dude didn’t tell me that he had a gambling problem and had previously signed something that barred himself from all casinos in the state. First he disappeared, then I started getting texts from him about how he was “such a loser” and had “lost all his money.” Then, after I have to come find him, he had me pretend that I won something on his machine because he wasn’t supposed to be gambling. Then he tried to make me sign up for some birthday promotion so he could get 10 more dollars to play. Awkward.... we stayed the night because it was 2 am and I had been throwing back crown and cokes while telling him how shitty he was for calling his ex in front of me. On the way back home the next morning, on about a 4 hour drive, he had to stop at every fucking casino (at least 3) to try to “get his money back.” It was like Fear and Loathing in Oklahoma... I was hungover on St. Patrick’s Day stopping at every Native American casinos along the highway full of people wearing green beads and chasing “luck.”
I had to ride back with him, so I was not happy or pleasant to be around. 


The only happy ending to this is that Willie Nelson never stops touring and I finally got to see him with my mom about 2 years after this.

160,"Based on my father: embarrassing your daughter in ways you can't embarrass your son. 

I started my period at school and had nothing for it. My mom was at work and my dad was off that day. School let me call him to ask him to bring a change of clothes and feminine products. He walked into school looking so happy with a big clear walmat bag, came into my class smiling and loudly said ""Here's your period stuff!"" I was mortified. Looking back now it's very funny though. "
161,One of my coworkers (that I initially thought about trying to hook up with) tried to flirt with me by mentioning how many miscarriages she's had. 
162,"Literally never. I married her because I'm comfortable around her and can be myself.

171,"Guys that lounge around the house in jeans....how?!!  I can't fathom doing this.  Denim is not comfortable to me.  I change into workout clothes, usually those nylon stretchy pants.  "
172,I’ll never understand why people carry their SSN on them... It’s one thing to get a debit/credit card or a license stolen but a SS card just seems so risky for 9 numbers that are barely used and easy to remember. 
173,So..... No second date? 
174,"Absolutely. I ended up in the roll of advice giver and she kept asking about relationship advice for her and her boyfriend at the time. 

I didn’t notice anything at first, but I slowly woke up to the fact that I was enabling her in manipulating this poor man. I was officially creeped out when she started explaining to me her plan to wake him up in the middle of the night and pretend she heard an intruder in the house to convince her boyfriend, who was against it, to buy a gun.

176,"I am an actual Girl Scout. My mom was the troop leader and I have four older sisters, so I was in it for real. I went to camp, earned badges, the works. This was mentioned constantly throughout high school, but I think it’s funny so it never bothered me at all.

One time during my senior year, I was being lippy with my calculus teacher for no good reason I’m sure. After he’d had enough and when it was perfectly timed immediately following a comment I made about how he couldn’t use his calculator correctly, he said, “Not all of us got our calculator badge during Girl Scouts.” Silence. I laughed pretty hard and so did everyone else. It was a fun class and the ownage was obvious."

185,"The reason why my dad stared off into space drunk every night. Like, I get it now. Cheating vindictive immature wife, disrespectful children, narcissistic and emotionally neglectful parents, plus all the stresses of running a household, going to work, taking care of all the bills. Fuck. I’m stressed just thinking about what my dad went through.

But the sad part is that because he was so lost and overwhelmed my entire life, he actually recreated his childhood circumstances during my childhood. My brothers and I all have his same demons. It breaks my heart that I can see his pain but the look of contempt in my brothers’ eyes when they talk about him. But still to this day he hasn’t faced the truth and his boys are slipping away year by year and I’m so afraid that one day he’s going to be gone or my brother will finally close off all the way and that’ll be it.

The night ended when she leaned over in my car to kiss me goodnight and ended up slobbering/licking my cheek cause I didn't kiss back. It was awkward."

210,"My middle school used our SSN as our student account number, so we had to tell our SSN to the lunch cashier lady and when we looked at our grades instead of using people's names they used our SSN's (they posted the grades to tests and stuff on a piece of paper in the wall in class). The idea was that it will help kids remember their SSN and offer some privacy so other students wouldn't know your grade because they don't know your SSN.

This was after she had cut her wrist and blamed it on me, telling all of her friends that I wanted her to do it.  God that girl was bananas.  "
212,"My dad was much the same way.  Except instead of money being tight, he just never felt well.  Imagine not having a solid bowel movement for years, struggles peeing.  Diabetic, insomnia, oh gosh high blood pressure and then some.  

It hit me when I was 16 and come home stoned one day.  He was asleep on the couch, having taken his evening meds (definitely a painkiller in there from when a car landed on his back in the early 60s).  I sat down and chatted with him a while, both of us a bit stoned.  In that moment I saw how tired he was.  How tired he had been.  All the years of blowing up at me or my sister, he was never really mad or angry at us.  He just couldn't keep up with the pace of the world.  

Too be honest I'm surprised he's still alive, he's on a cocktail of meds.  My mom finally retired a few years back and he's been doing better, having company throughout the day.


Maybe sometimes assholes are just tired, but then some truly are just assholes."

We were playing a game of cornhole (bean bag toss game for those not from the south), and the guy told me to fetch the bags for the next game. Didn’t like being told but was going to just do it. As I turn to gather them, he proceeds to slap my ass and say something along the lines of good girl. Wtf? He does this in front of his friends and I hear chuckles. This was only our second meet up so I still didn’t really know him. Funny enough, I really wasn’t attracted to him but I gave him a chance because we had mutual family friends who kept telling me how nice he was. After that, I made some see through excuse and left. I then proceed to ignore his sporadic texts for the next several months. I generally think people deserve more respect than being ghosted but I made an exception for him. "

They order an appetizer. After some chit chat, my buddy heads to the bathroom. When he gets back, he sees that the appetizer came, and his date had eaten all of it while he was peeing. No worry. 

They order the main course. She eats hers incredibly fast, then starts picking at his. This grossed him out, so he kinda “lets” her finish his entree. 
They order dessert. While they are waiting for dessert, my buddy witnesses a younger girl head towards the bathroom. A slimy older man who had been hanging around walked to the bathroom and went into the girls restroom door.  My buddy springs into action, runs to the bathroom, kicks the guy out of the bathroom and the restaurant and then spends a few minutes explaining to the staff what had happened.
He sits back down and him and his date  are talking for quite a while when he notices that dessert hasn’t come yet. He keeps trying to flag down his waitress but she’s kind of ignoring him. Finally, he walks over to her and asks when the desert is coming. The waitress tells him “ I delivered both desserts to your table a while ago and your date ate both of them while you were dealing with that guy in the bathroom”

TLDR my buddy’s date ate the entire appetizer, most of his entrée, and both desserts"

251,"Couple of big points:

The harder you try, the more you fail.  If all you care about is meeting women and getting laid, that desperation will consciously or subconsciously show through.  You'll come off as clingy or just plain off to most women you meet, and you'll attempt to escalate things way too quickly.  You'll also develop a kind of nice guy syndrome where you start thinking that by paying for expensive meals and waiting on women hand and foot, they're going to like you more.  They won't.

First and foremost, as counter-intuitive as it sounds, you have to stop giving a shit.  Start being more confident in yourself, be more aloof, and don't always treat women like they're some princess. This doesn't mean mistreat women, at all, it just means don't be afraid to say no to something, or to let a woman pay for her own meal sometimes.  Be real, don't pretend you want to do things just to please the woman, she'll see right through it and you'll look bad.

Second, it's a numbers game.  These days especially, women have access to so many men in their dating pool, from their peers/coworkers to random people at bars/clubs to online dating, you're one of millions and most of the time you'll get passed up just because she didn't feel interested in talking or dating at that moment, and she has that ability to be choosey because there's 1000 other dudes waiting their turn.  Women may not like to acknowledge this, but it's the truth: women have a massive, massive advantage over men in the dating game, it's just the way things work.

So never get hung up on one woman, always have your options open, and never let a rejection or a fizzled out connection get you down because there are a million reasons why it could have happened.  Always know that unless you really have some lightning chemistry, you'll never mean as much to a woman in the earliest stages of dating as she does to you, and so she'll flake or walk seemingly out of nowhere.  It happens to everyone, it's just like fishing: it's not about the 100 or 200 that got away, what matters is finally making that big catch, and that only happens through patience and persistence.

Not gonna sit here and give you some bullshit Disney romance version of reality.  Take this advice and your situation will improve."
252,"He showed up in a red, belled sleeve silk shirt and big bell white pants; the shirt was opened several buttons too many, and he was wearing at least 3 big gold chains (this was in 1995, so he was about 15 years too late for this look).

He seemed to be a good guy, and I hope he found his disco lady out there somewhere."
253,"Speaking of crazy, and jackets;  

&amp;#x200B;

I met a very attractive girl at a bar, and we exchanged about 3 sentences right before I left. Bartender had already made last call, wouldn't serve me as I'd just come in too late. This girl was extremely drunk, and offered me one of her drinks. It seemed odd to me, and I never like taking gifts/handouts from people, and since she wouldn't let me pay her I declined the offer. Also, she was just so impossibly drunk I really didn't have the energy to interact with her. I left, and a few days later I get a text from her. She'd asked around (really small town) and gotten my number from a mutual friend. I think I was so flattered I ignored a number of obvious red flags and agreed to go out with her.  

&amp;#x200B;

Our first 'date', I picked her up from her apartment and she was already so drunk she could barely walk. Her TV was smashed in one corner, there was a fist sized hole in a wall, the door jam on her bedroom door was busted, and she downed a heroic dose a cheap vodka just as we're walking out the door. She wants to go to my place now. I try to talk her out of it and get her to stay home. Not happening. Before we'd even made it to the end of her street, she's crying and holding my hand, telling me about her ex. Awesome.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I comfort her and grin and bear it because I'm at least a mediocre human, and I assume she'll just fall asleep and I can lock myself in my spare bedroom and wait her out till the morning. Wrong. The second we get into my house she's all over me. She pushed me into a wall and is biting my lip so hard I ended up with some legitimate bruising the next day. She starts telling me she does gymnastics and is VERY flexible. Puts her leg up and rests it on my shoulder. She had very powerful legs. At one point she was legit crushing my ribs with them. Anyway, things got weird for me, she was far to drunk to be doing this with me, and I insisted on sleeping in the other room.  

&amp;#x200B;

Morning now, and we both have to work at different places in a nearby town, so I take her with me. She doesn't know where she's working. Seriously. It's her fist day, she's never been there, and honestly she still seems really drunk. She needs to call someone to figure out the address, but of course her phone's screen is busted and she has to use voice commands to call someone. The person she calls? A convicted sex offender. She tells me this as she's handing me the phone and asks me to talk to him, because she doesn't want to. Awesome. I get the address. Cheers to the sex offender for waking up at 7:00 am on a Saturday to field questions. She's going to be a server on a train that does some kind of leisure tours through the mountains. I walk her to the station, say what I hope will be our last goodbye, and then leave to go to work.  

&amp;#x200B;

All day long I'm getting nonsensical texts from this girl. She's probably still drunk, I assume drinking while working because the train serves alcohol, and using speak to text. So it's just a jumbled mess. The only part of it I understood was something about a jacket. She bought me one somewhere they stopped along the way and is very insistent that I take it. I politely decline, explain that I don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other again, end up blocking her number.  

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally she shows up at my house a few days later. No idea how she remembered where I lived, how she got there (no license, or car because of a few DUIs), or what she thought was going to happen. She's got the....absolute ugliest, ill-fitting fake leather jacket I've ever seen. If the Dollar General sold jackets, this would be it. I end up trying it on for her, and it was actually in my closet until I moved recently. It sent a chill up my spine when I saw it. Reminded me that I very nearly became a jacket myself, because clearly this woman was going to skin me to make one. "

259,"I dated a girl who was homeschooled for a bit while I was in high school. She was so out of my league. To this day, I still don't understand it. I asked her to my senior prom and she said she really wanted to go, but her dad wouldn't let her. (""I know what kind of things happen"", he said.) She told me she didn't want me to miss out on such a big event in my life and for me to take a friend. We had pictures made and had a good time.

Shortly after prom, I found out through a mutual friend (who was genuinely concerned) that she had taken the photos from my prom and printed them off. She then bought a dress and went to the spot we had the pics taken and took her own. She cut out the girl I went with and scotch taped her own photo in and posted them all around her room. She also burnt the photos of my date.

Needless to say, I noped right on out of there."

Got set up on a date by one of our clients, which I know now is a bad idea in general, but the girl was fun and super cute, so I thought what the hell. We went on a few dates, hit it off pretty well, and then things just went way south after that. She started texting me non-stop, even when she knew I was at work, basically just keeping tabs on my every move. When we would hang out, I had zero personal space, she attached herself to my hip.

I had been thinking of breaking things off with her but couldn't really bring myself to do it, until my roommate and I threw a New Year's Eve party at our place, and I caught her making out with my roommate. She cried and cried, apologizing, saying she just felt sorry for him (he had been wallowing in his own self-pity to her for awhile, I guess). I showed her the door, and that was that."

* All the goddamn hair -- the worst is in between your toes when you walk around the house
* Boys generally are unclean, but girls are not as clean as they think they are.
* Constantly asking for animals/pets when we have more than enough (""wtf would you do with a chicken?!?"")
* Easily embarrassed, making them a good source of amusement
* Your overprotective side comes out when boys start appearing
* They change their minds/interests. A LOT. Mostly based on their friends. Gymnastics, soccer, ballet, dance, back to soccer, lacrosse, music, video games
* They won't share your interests, so it's harder to ""bond"" with them when they get older
* They are more eager to have a job than I ever was
* Newborn to age 3 not much different than boys
* Between 3-9 very sweet and fun. You become a superhero.
* Between age 9-12 their ""friendships"" have way more drama than necessary. Just listen. You become a chauffeur.
* Between age 13-17 puberty makes them weird, distant, moody. You become an ATM.
* Around 18-20 they become normal again and actually listen to your advice/experience. You become a superhero again!

It goes by so fast...so fast. One minute you're looking at her take her first steps, the next minute you're having a beer with her on her 21st. Take lots of videos &amp; pictures...living in the moment is one thing, but there are too many to remember them all."

Turns out it was my ex and some of her friends. Total fucking creeps, I had to pull some action hero Baby Driver shit just to lose them and my car was having some trouble at the time so I ended up having to pay like a grand to get it fixed because I had to drive so fucking badassily.

307,"About ten years ago I moved to a new town for work and met a guy through a dating website.  He invited me to dinner and a movie.  I was 25 and didn’t know anyone, so I was happy to get out and do something fun.  Within a few minutes of meeting and talking, it was obvious to me that we were not compatible.  No big deal - these things happen.  When the bill came, I told him I was paying for my own meal and he refused to let me.  I was a bit irritated by this, but didn’t want to cause a scene.   He then realized he forgot his wallet and asked me to pay for him.  I was fine with this and happy for him to take me home since he didn’t have money on him for the movie.  To my surprise, he then took me to the movie theater.  He had selected the movie without consulting me and had two tickets waiting for us for Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.  This further confirmed our incompatibility, as I would have never chosen to see that.  But I decided there was no harm in trying new things, so I went in to the movie with him.  The theater was filled with screaming children and their families.  He spotted someone he knew and sprinted towards them.  I casually followed behind him and saw him settle into a seat in the second row of the theater right next to an older couple he appeared to know.  It turns out that the older couple was his parents!  So I met this guy’s parents and he introduced me to them as his girlfriend!  He called me by the wrong name, but I didn’t bother to correct him.  At this point I was just enjoying letting the comedy of errors unfold.  I was trapped at the theater because he drove us there, so there wasn’t much else I could do.  His mom kept calling me the wrong name (I never corrected her) and was offering me popcorn and candy and drinks while her son was trying to make a move by sliding his arm around me during a children’s movie.  All this with Ray Romano’s grating voice bellowing in the background.  I was glad for the date to be over.  The next day he sent me a message online asking me for another date.  I politely declined.  A few weeks later he messaged me again and asked if I could pretend to be his girlfriend and pretend to go by the wrong name he had called me and attend his cousin’s wedding with him as his date.  He said his mom was asking about me.  By that time I had met the man I would eventually marry and we had a good laugh about it.  I wonder if that guy is still going on dates with his parents."

For a grand total of about a week when she started to go psycho about other girls, me playing football, me hanging with my friends.

So I broke up with her. Everybody thought I was crazy because she was so hot.

And then she broke into my locker to take my football jacket so she could pretend we were still together. And she beat up another girl that she thought wanted me. 

The nail in the coffin is when I crashed in my buddy's van after a party, and I woke up next to her. The van was locked, and other guys were sleeping in the van, too. That's when everybody realized how crazy she was.

But the scariest thing she told me was that she had a co-worker who she had always had some irrational but immense dislike of pretty much from the moment she met him, to the point that being around him caused her physical pain. She later ""figured out"" that one of his past lives had *killed* one of hers, and that pain she was feeling was in the spot where ""past life him"" had *stabbed* ""past life her."" ...Yeah. "
321,"He told me he doesn’t pay his student loans that total 100,000. So the debt collectors are after him. Instead he chooses to spend the money on a 3D printer. He is printing a life size iron man with that 3D printer. In his basement. "
322,I would warn your manager so if she does a 160 and starts blaming you for sexual harassment. Make sure you've notified management first. Always be first to report.
323,"This stereotype has always been so off for me, almost every kitchen I've worked in has always been at least 60% male. Most of the women in my life aren't great cooks either. ""Women needs to stay in the kitchen"" is just a dumb '50s mentality from America before Julia child changed the game."
324,"This. So much this.

325,"He did. Multiple times. They had dated about a year, maybe a year and a half, and she knew enough about him to guess the new passwords based on his password hints. He was terrified of her (rightly so), and it took four months to convince him to change his number because he was frightened of her anger. The day he finally changed his number, she reported that he had hit her to the police in retaliation. "

335,"I was always the last kid picked up from after school or camp. It was embarrassing that I had to wait by the door with a staff member or counselor and wait for my mom. Every pair of headlights that passed I would hope it would be her. I recently joked about this with her, and that's when it hit me... she was working long hours so she could afford these things for me. Broke my heart a little. I love her and all the sacrifices she made for me."
336,"Been there before. Find a new scent to have as your own!

339,Wait you continued the date?
340,"I met this girl on tinder, 9/10 looks, but she wanted to be amish. Now that doesn't sound too bad but she wanted to be amish so that she could be abused by her spouse. She had issues with a drug dealing ex who also was charged with distribution of child pornography but she continued to see him. She claimed she was waiting for marraige to have sex but they had sex a lot. 100% sure she had a rape fetish. She also believed that microwaved food gives you cancer and that putting onions on your feet sucks the toxins out (which toxins? I have no idea). I got out of there ASAP"
341,"See, that would give me a REASON to smile (I hardly ever receive compliments) and it would work. "

349,"My brother's dog fucking loves me. Every time I go to see them he runs up to me and freaks out wagging his tail, jumping on me and i hug him and play with him for a bit. 

Awhile back I brought my gf to visit them for the first time. My brother was out in the yard and his dog saw me and immediately started running to me. As he neared I crouched down to get my doggo hugs and he ran *right past me* to my gf - completely fucking ignoring me - and gave *her* all the love and attention that he would normally give to me.

Our relationship has never recovered. "
350,"I walked a girl back to her dorm room with a roommate of mine after our first date at a movie (We went to school in a small town, like 1,000 people in the two plus another 1,000 at the school, everywhere was walking distance). 

We were at fork in the sidewalk, I went right with my GF and my roomie went left towards our dorm. We stopped in her lobby by an unlit fireplace. I pulled her in close and gave her a kiss. She kissed back. As she pulled away she said, “You’re trouble.”

Fast forward 10.5 years: she’s my wife now and to this day still calls me trouble.

354,"Once on a long road trip with my then GF I had been driving for about 3 hours. She was in the passenger seat. She put her hand on the back of my neck and started massaging it in the most serene manner. It was one of the best non-sex feelings I've ever felt. It made me sleepy though so I had to make her stop, but had her do it later.

^(PS she also gave me road head too)

""Been a minute! Definitely!""

""Great see you there!""

I get there and she immediately introduces me to her fiance.

I played friendly and had a beer and left. I am still confused to this day with what the hell that was about. Like... We weren't friends. We had no relationship outside of sex ever. God that was such a weird night."

Then she talked about Harry Potter, ""greatest book ever written"", she was 20 btw. Then that she wasn't ready for a sexual relationship for a year or so . Then that she didn't mean blow jobs though, and that I seemed nice and that she'd give me one in the car on the next date. Then that she really doesn't mind giving me BJ's anytime if we start dating and I can have sex with other women so long she there and can actually see me pull out because she understands men need sex but I shouldn't be fathering any children with other women while dating her. Her eyes were bugged out the entire time.... Not a joke. Also I went out with her a second time, it's a LONG story, but I didn't want to and was roped into it... And no I didn't want a BJ or ask for one or accept one. 
I felt bad for her, obviously not mentally sound, but my instinct was to run."
373,"I was living in a dorm my first year of college. The girl that lived directly under me looked really good and I met her personally through a mutual friend. She would then proceed to be obsessed with me, sending nude pictures of herself on a daily basis for over a month. She slept with a different dude almost every night so I knew I wasn’t the only one. She would try to grab my dick at all times she saw me, even walking to class in public. Being 18, I liked the attention early on, but that wore off fast. I had to tell her that I was not interested and she had a hard time understanding "
374,"Yeah, I gave a guy my phone number and he started sending me videos of him going out and killing stray cats with a bow and arrow... 

No thanks"
375,Was there any reason the cashier girl wouldn't serve her?
376,"Its weird because as a teen, none of it matters so you don't actually need to care and should be living it up, its not until you have responsibilities and accountability that you need to care about public perception of you, but thats almost exactly when you stop giving a fuck."
377,Oh sorry she eventually ghosted him and told him he was too weird so it wouldn't work out. Even vamp fitness models have standards
378,i too like to watch toddlers eat
379,"You should try putting some sort of AstroTurf or real grass in the poop box and see if that helps things. She’s probably conditioned that “grass under my feet means it’s ok to poop here”, the gravel might feel uncomfortable on her foot pads.  I just asked my dad, who is a veterinarian, and that was his suggestion. If you put AstroTurf in there it would also be easy to pick the poops up cleanly with a bag and throw them out, and you could hose it down every so often so it doesn’t stink. "
380,I didn't think I'd have to hear this again after I left middle school
381,They killed her
382,"Someone did this to me in middle school, but they messed up by going to the gas station up the street. I watched them pull in and proceeded to ride my bike as fast as I could down the frontage road. Two guys went inside and left a woman outside to pump the gas. I took a Dr. Pepper, I brought from home, out of my backpack. Shook it up as much as possible. Cracked the tab and pitched it through their sun roof like some drive by and biked it fast and hard across a field. It ended with both parties flipping each other off as I biked further and further away. Good times indeed. Also don't throw shit at people from your car and park within eyesight of them."

The day I came back,  he turned up on my doorstep with a bottle of champagne, ran my tired jet lagged arse a bath, cooked me a perfect John Dorry, and invited me out on his boat for when the weather got better. 

The thinking part of my brain, recovering from an abusive marriage, thought “this is a bullshit, love bombing move, that belongs in a rom com, not real life. Gorgeous triathlete yacht owning professionals don’t hit on knackered single mothers.” The horny part of my brain thought “fuck it, let’s see what happens”.

Fortunately horny won, and I’m now two years into a relationship with a wonderful guy who is teaching my how to sail and how to think a little more highly of myself."

389,"Met a girl on a dating app and started talking. She seemed like a female version of me. Angry at the same things, critiquing the same things. We met up and she was the rudest person ever. She did things that humbled the duck out of me. When I got home and explained the date to my roommate, it made me realize everything wrong with me and what I needed to change about myself. "
390,Nah. I had already rejected her advances before and I didn't want to turn back on that

I've also used one the had tiny bits of coconut in it that was great. To be honest I just get any scrub and just choose based on the smell, but find what works for you my man"

Guess the shift sheet was wrong cause i was actually supposed to work at 9 am. So i get a call at 9:30 where am i? Well im an hour away doing errands. I freaked out at first and started getting so mad and thats when it hit me - there was absolutely nothing I could do. Worrying wasnt gonna get me there.

I'm Chinese-Vietnamese and I'm not maligning Korean guys out there, but she tells me that I should ""take charge"" more in the sense that she wanted to be ordered around to do stuff like cooking, etc. She got angry at me because she hated the fact that I was trying to emotionally connect to her and worried about her emotionally as she was going through a stressful time, and snapped when I asked ""are you alright?"" and offered to be a shoulder/get her anything/do anything for her that would comfort her. She called me annoying and told me that the guys in her culture never do something like this.

At that point I'm confused and called everything off."

He walked me to my car and we kept talking and it was cold so we decided to talk in the car. Out of nowhere, literally nowhere- the guy unzips his pants and pulls out his penis. I was so disgusted and disappointed. I ended up kicking him out of my car and never spoke to him again. A few years later he tried adding me on FB- total creep. "

I had fun with it and didn't hold back my incredibly dry and pointed sense of humour; she got incredibly defensive when I called her a Cakist 'cause she didn't like cheesecake.

443,"When I was 16 I was in intensive outpatient treatment for an eating disorder. Smoking hot girl was clearly into me. Took me into the back stairwell and we made out. She then told me she was 21. I'd already given her my cell number and she immediately started texting and calling me nonstop. This went on for two days, day and night, I'm freaked out and trying to gently cool it. The counselors had an emergency meeting with me and explained she's extremely troubled (shocker I know) and this has happened before with other patients over the course of years. I stop answering texts and calls, they are keeping her separated from me during the day and having me leave early. The next morning my mom knocks on my door at like 630 AM on a Saturday saying ""Hey, there's someone named Amy calling for you?"" She knew my last name and I guess I had mentioned my hometown (clinic was in the nearest city) at some point. I asked her how she got my home number and she said she called a bunch of listings with my last name asking for me until she actually got the right one. I don't even know how she got listings of numbers in my town. She asked to come to where I live so she could see my bedroom and meet my mom and just kept going on and on manically. I eventually got her off the phone and explained everything to my mom, we got ahold of the place and let the counselors know and they said they would keep us separated and deal with her, and basically told me to just completely ignore her. When I went back that Monday, she wasn't there but was staking out the entrance because when I left, she appeared a block down the road and was screaming about how much she loved me and we were meant to get married and have babies and how I betrayed her etc etc. I just apologized and kept walking until I got to my train station, then called the clinic and told them what happened. Never saw her again. This all happened over a period of 6 days, a Tuesday through that Monday.

Damn she was hot though."

447,"In a way, a father is a daughter's first love (obviously not some incestuous shit you sick fucks!). You're showing her how a man should treat her and how she should treat him in return. The love a father gets from his daughter, he'll never get from his sons. 

With my boys, I am teaching them how to be men. Not saying I love them any less, but the bond we share is far more like a bros type thing. Similarly, my daughter will never feel this from me. "
448,"Our first date. I lost my voice the day before. The line at the restaurant was too long (the restaurant doesn’t take reservations) so we missed the movie we were going to see. We had to settle for a really terrible bottom-of-the-barrel comedy. Had a sudden bout of nausea and *nearly* threw up in a Walmart parking lot. And finally, we left town and got pulled over and written a speeding ticket for not noticing a speed zone change and going 10 mph over. 

We’re engaged now and getting married in September. Almost every outside thing that could go wrong, did. Almost comically. Yet it felt nothing but perfect the entire date and neither of us were awkward for a second. It was like we already knew each other, and we never had a doubt. 

I don’t know if that is movie-like, but it’s the best I can do. "

459,"Went on a first and only date with a really cute gal that resulted in this horrific sequence of events:

1.	Telling me how she did cocaine in the first 30 minutes
2.	Discussing problems with her mother and how she wasn’t proud of her achievements
3.	Her getting very drunk and hanging off of me like a girlfriend would
4.	Talked about how she didn’t want to go home because her roommate was having sex with her boyfriend all the time
5.	Secretly ordered us shots while I went to the washroom (I was driving and did not plan on getting drunk on a first date) and then proceeded to say the debit card in her purse did not actually work so I paid for everything
6.	Started crying about the previously mentioned family issues
7.	I offered to drive her home after she lost it on me for asking if she’s okay but she refused because of the previously mentioned roommate situation
8.	Stated her friends couldn’t drive her anywhere and couldn’t get a cab because of the “useless” card and forgetting her wallet
9.	I offered to driver her anywhere as she was quite drunk to which she said she had some friends at this bar in the neighbourhood so I drove her but she had first suggested dropping her off at her office to get her which i asked if she could even get in, she lost it on me for asking that...
10. 6 to 9 above took about 45 minutes to get through
11. Pulled up to the bar and asked if this was fine to which she said she had friends her but didn’t really like them...
12. She proceeded to look back at me one foot out the door hoping for me to say stay at my place or something

15. The next morning she texts saying sorry in a way that paid no respect to the shit show that was the previous night

My date asked if the wrong-door woman was someone I was also dating.  I said no.

She asked again at dinner.  I said no.

She asked at the bar as we danced.  I said no.

She asked again when we went back to her place.  I said no.

She asked as my penis entered her vagina.  I said no.

She asked again as I ejaculated, like right in the middle of my, ""GUHGA-GUHGA-GOO-GOO-GOO!"" ball-flapping good time.

471,"For the sake of convenience I'll break it into three camps:

1. Bona-fide nihilistic hedonists. These are the guys (and girls) that simply don't give a shit about anything and are just looking to get by while staying as screwed up as possible. They only sober up long enough to be able to have an orgasm. There's no underlying agenda really, they're just fashionable drunks, dopers, and/or sex addicts.

2. The guys rebelling against societal norms. Some of these folks' ideologies would have had them in the back of a Volkswagon following the Grateful Dead if they were born in my grandparents' generation, but nowadays they take migrant farm work (some actual farms, some pot / opium farms) up and down the coast (and yes, some still do work as roadies) and save cash by sleeping in their cars or hopping trains and sleeping under bridges. In the meanwhile they also panhandle, busk, do session music work, bartend, work the farmers market, do day labor, or whatever other honest work that isn't ""sucking a big corporate dick, man"". They're usually freegans and anarchists and aren't usually handicapped by any hard drug addiction or psychiatric disorder. They just want to live that way, because normal society depresses them. They're usually really skilled in any number of things, but you'd never know it because their agenda against capitalism means they never advertise.

3. Folks who choose to do it simply because it's an accessible scene to align oneself with. This might be rich kids taking a year off before college who feel like doing something ""edgy"", it might be wayward youths trying to get ""points"" in the scene by hanging out with ""authentic punk rockers"", or it might be other poor folks who don't really care about the ""punk"" aspect but don't want to fall in with the other street cultures. Being homeless in a big city is a little like being in prison: there's distinct groups, and there's both drama and commerce, *and* established grounds where one may be welcome or unwelcome... especially when there's people selling drugs or sex or trying to con people. The hobos always know who's hooking and who's selling what, and there's always someone more desperate than you who might shake you down even if it's just for ten bucks and a pack of smokes. If you're gonna be on the street one way or another, sometimes you just need a crew you can trust. And punks are usually a very welcoming people (at least where I've been), provided you're good company."
472,Please.  Tell him you understand.  You forgive.   And you love him.  Being a parent is such a thankless job.  Few are lucky enough to be finally appreciated when their kids mature.   I know now how tough it was.

478,"Sophomore year of college, about 9 months after I'd broken up with my ""serious"" girlfriend.  I was still in a rough spot in terms of self-esteem, then suddenly this fairly attractive girl almost literally appeared out of nowhere.  In fact, she just happened to be walking past a couple of my friends and I as we were talking about going to a museum as part of a project for one of our classes.  She stopped to talk to us, and asked if she could come along because she loved that museum but didn't have a car.  Of course we invited her, because when you're a goofy awkward 20 year old and an attractive woman with an interest in cool historical subjects comes along, you don't question it.  So she came with us on the excursion and it actually went fairly well.  She turned out to be insanely smart, basically a walking encyclopedia on most facets of American history.  She insisted on giving me her number and couldn't believe my luck!   
And that's when the crazy hit.  I didn't realize it at first because hot smart girl, but she texted me nonstop and got very clingy very fast.  Asked if I was upset if I took longer than 5 minutes to respond, etc.  Even after I started to realize she wasn't super stable, I just went with it because I liked the attention.  Anyways, it turns out she was a Confederate apologist (thought the South was the correct side in the American civil war, for anyone not familiar with that term), which finally brought me to my senses and gave me a convenient excuse to stop talking to her.  It didn't stop her for about a week though, I guess she thought she could convince me that slavery wasn't that bad or something.  She did eventually give up, thank God. "

487,"Cowgirl: nothing beats seeing the face expression, figure, and boobs at the same time!"
488,"It’s not like I’m incapable of experiencing anger, I just very easily negate it. I’ll still burst out a swear when I stub my toe, or get annoyed at someone who doesn’t move out of the left lane. But it never builds up to the point where I ride someone’s ass on the highway or want to start swinging or anything. "
489,"A friend of mine was seeing this girl on and off for about two years. She really loved him, but for him it was just sex mostly. At the end of them seeing each other he kind of got into a serious relationship with another girl. This lasted for two or three years. It was really sad, because the girl he was initially seeing was obviously crushed by this. It doesn't help that generally she was socially very awkward and ended up at almost every event that the guy (and his then current girlfriend) would be at. Just staring at them for hours.. it was just sad. 

Anyway said friend broke up with his then girlfriend and started talking to this initial girl again. Nothing happened though, he didn't want to. But since they had a lot in common he thought it would be ok'ish to have a bit of contact here and there. Well this lead to the point where she just completely snapped. As a result, she would stalk him all day via every medium possible - to the point where he blocked her everywhere. We're talking hundreds of text messages (via phone, social media etc.) and emails per day etc. Blocking her didn't do a thing: she kept on making new email addresses and kept on throwing (physical) letters in his mailbox etc. The messages were just off the hook. She was doing a lot of drugs at the time and it was mostly about that she really needed him to have sex with her or else she would commit suicide etc. I've read a bunch of these emails. Everything capitalized etc. It was crazy. After a few weeks he couldn't take it anymore and went to the police. They actually ended up having a social worker visit her at home and getting her into some sort of program. It was the only way for her to get rid of the claim, but she did officially end up with a restraining order. 

I think she's doing a lot better now. It's a few years ago now. I mean yeah she went nuts, but i still feel for her. Love is some powerful stuff and if someone messes with your head like that for two years and then suddenly tells you that this time he's really in love with someone else.. I mean it doesn't justify her behavior, but yeah it hurts."
490,"Dated a former cheerleader when I was in college.  Super cute, quirky etc.  When we had sex she liked to call me ""daddy big dick"".  It didn't take long to figure out she was kinda crazy and confused.  I tried to not get too emotionally attached so (it was pretty much just a sexual relationship) when she dumped me I just said ""ok"".  Her response was something like ""don't you want to know why? "" and I just said ""no"".  I could tell she was just trying to get a response from me, but I wasn't going to let her fuck me up emotionally.  We had a pretty close group of friends and saw each other all time, so I asked for some space ""I'd rather not interact with you for a few weeks"".  She told everyone I said I never want to see her again.  Two weeks later she had a threesome with my roommate and her friend.  Roommate came back and told me about it and some shit she said about our relationship.  So he kind of fell for her manipulative bullshit.  Lisa C, I hope your crazy ass got some therapy."

505,"When I was younger I never really realized just how different life could be from adult to adult.

As a kid you get the sense that everyone is on basically equal footing. After all, we all go to basically the same schools and we all get fed and have a roof over our heads.

I didn't realize that adult life is basically a free for all, and it's what you make of it. And that some people have really shit luck and have a much harder time keeping afloat than others. And that security and happiness are far from guaranteed.

It's daunting, but also kind of liberating in a way. At least I get the privilege of being able to see it as liberating because I was fortunate enough to be born in a fairly affluent, healthy family with great guidance from my parents all the way into adulthood.

It makes me a lot more grateful for the work my parents put in to give me a good shot at success."

508,"I have a bit of a different ""something from the movies"" story. I met a girl through friends of friends long story short we ended up dating for about 5 months and one of the last dates we went on was to a star dome observatory at the base of a hill (Basically just look at stars with big telescopes) After the date I had planned a small 5 min walk to the top of the hill. I packed a couple of blankets, one of my thick jackets for her and some hot chocolate. We spent the next 4 or so hours cuddled up on the top of this hill overlooking the city gazing at the stars drinking hot chocolate and talking. She told me it was one of the best dates she had ever been on kind of like something from the movies. A month or so later she told me she wasn't feeling it and that was the last time we spoke. I'll always wonder if she remembers that night. I know I wont forget it because I was beginning to fall hard for her its probably why I can remember it so vividly lol"
509,"Agreed!  I said it a little in jest but mostly in truth.  This is one of the many things people are referring to whenever ""toxic masculinity"" is brought up.

I took the train to see here yesterday afternoon, and she was standing at patform to greet me. Very small but made me feel really good. She walked me in and said she'll take care of me. (recently dislocated my shoulder)

She had bought me blanket as a surprise from the day before while she was out. Made me dinner, got drinks. Basically wouldnt let me do a single thing all night.
When it got late we went to bed. She told me to stand still as she took off my clothes. She proceeded to lay me down and basically give me a full body massage, ending with the slowest most loving HJ. But before I was about to finish, she stopped and said while im staying with her, she is going to make me ache and want her.

I'm more than melted. Physically and emotionally."
515,That our definition of old changes. At one point in my life I believed that 25 was old and when I was 25 I couldn't fathom being 40. But I'm well past 40 now and having the time of my life. I wish I could have gotten to my 40s earlier in life!

551,"I once knew this girl who's beauty was only surpassed by her crazy. She was gorgeous but something just wasn't right about her and you learned this soon after she opened her mouth. I was riding the bus with her and I decided to shoot my shot. So I was like ""Hi I'm goblinshark."" She says, ""Yeah that's right you live on 123 Any Street and your number is 555-1212."" She was right, I had never before said a word to this girl and she knew all of that information. This was before smartphones. There was no instant google, she would have had to look up my stuff and memorize all of that without even knowing that I was going to talk to her. 16 y/o me thought ""wow she must be into me if she knows all of that."" so I continued to talk to her. She was a wierdo. She was talking about me wooing her with a mideaval underarm sweat apple. She wanted me to take her into the city to wear full latex bodysuits and see Prodigy at some underground nightclub. A lot of the stuff she said sounded like she was trolling but no, she had a crazy sincerity about all of it. The relationship never went anywhere
She always seemed like she was interested but just out of reach. Later I found out that she did this to most guys that she dealt with. Looking back the phone number and address wasn't interest it was creepy af. 

Oh and another time one of my boys invited her to the movies. She said yes thinking that he meant with the whole crew. Lol he was all hyped thinking he scored a date with this chick... So they meet at the theater and she's got this confused look on her face. ""Where's everyone else? He's like ""Everyone who? "" then it hit him and he says "" You thought I wanted you to come hang out with the guys?""  To which she replied ,""Of course what did you think this was a date."" 

Smh she crushed that boys spirit with that one. He went home mad as hell and we didn't help matters, he told us the story and we clowned him over that for months after."

I told her to be nice to my then gf to which she giggled and said “I’m always nice.” She’s never nice. She cares, she loves, but she’s never nice. I could see my sister practically salivating at the sight of the doe eyed blonde in a pink dress. I don’t even remember what was said because I was so stunned.  What I do know is my sister came out swinging. Her lips curled a saccharine smile while she launched her attack. And with a quick cute retort my now wife completely disarmed her. I honestly thought my sister would drop the smile and go for the jugular but her smile turned genuine and they became best friends. Which sucks for me when they’re together except one time at the dog park when these two ladies tried to start shit with them. They were like a Goku and Vegeta tag team but words instead of fists.

I see this all the time when people try to defend catcalling - it's just a compliment! You should be flattered! Sure, maybe if it's someone I know and it's a genuine compliment, or someone I'm actively interested in, and the comment doesn't make me feel like a piece of meat.

575,"You will be the strongest person in the house for decades. Huge ego boost. 

Also, I am swimming in affection and am usually the center or attention. If my wife sees my daughter cuddling me, she wants to cuddle me. 

So mostly ego building positives but they work for me. "
576,Haha. Annoying as fuck. 
577,"We just finished appetizers when the police came in and arrested her for shop lifting from the shop next door. Fortunately, the waiter could testify that I was already waiting for 30 minutes and it was obviously a first date.

She was cute though"
578,*sniff my hazelnut sack*
579,"Never make him trying to approach girls, or boys, a cute topic for you to enjoy. It's not for you, it's not about you, it's an awkward stage that he doesn't need to be belittled during. Being cute is the opposite of being capable and independent and the harsh reality is that the later is what's attractive in men. "
580,"Seriously, what's girly about lime and tequila?"
581,"Telling the cheated that the cheater hooked up with you usually doesn't end well. They're going to blame you, not the cheater (at least in most cases)."
582,Did you go on dates with Angela? 
583,"They really don't ""overlook"" them. Arrested and not charged? Drinking underaged? Sure, no one cares about little stuff like that, but if someone has a DUI they really need to show that it was an isolated incident, and even then, they need a stronger application to get to the same place. "
584,"I would probably have reacted similarly. Still - sticking to the facts: she's clearly communicating her expectations, and the ""find a name for our babies"" discussion, if taken seriously, can actually tell a lot about the ability to make it work.

But maybe the core issue is: the game of courtship isn't played the same everywhere, realizing that the rules you know are weird, awkward and strange, too, like everyone elses might be a little of a shock. "
585,"Oh come on now, you're not making any sense and sensibility with that argument"
586,Probably not as healthy if if doesn't make me laugh.
587,"Just say, “ummm...she’s got a good personality...”

And you’re off the hook."
588,My ferret climbed up my shorts and bit my nuts in front of a group of my friends and I stood up screaming with it hanging from me. 
589,"Look for one made with sugar. The exfoliating beads pollute the ocean. Besides, sugar is better for your skin because it melts."
590,So you went on a date with Fez?
591,"Me too! Except I use BB cream, nearly the same thing. "
592,"The time between my girlfriend and I meeting, and me realizing I was in love with her was about a month. We got very close very quickly, and both had a lot of walls up. We had a ton in common and I was experiencing feelings I'd never felt in my life. Everything felt at peace. Everything felt right. This storm that had been in my head and in my heart as a single man, and even in my past long-term relationships was nowhere to be found. 

I trusted her in ways I'd never trusted anyone. For my entire adult I'd had this picture in my head of the woman I wanted to spend my life with. Her face, features, body - all a blur. But I could see it in my dreams and when I imagined my future. When we got together, for the first time since this picture had formed in my head, the features cleared out and took shape to fit her. I didn't have to force the image like I'd had to in the past. I didn't have to convince myself of anything. She was just there.

My entire outlook on marriage, children, settling down, and so on was beginning to shift. 2 years and 3 years with past exes respectively, and I'd never faltered for a second on my adamant feelings of being against all of those.

I fell in love, and I fell hard. Above all else, I was overwhelmed with this feeling of certainty that I knew I had to hold on to this girl for dear life. People have come and gone from my life over the years, and I'd always been okay with that. But her. I knew I'd never be okay if she was one of the ones to go.

I ignored the fear of saying it ""too soon"". I fought the stigma of looking too deeply into the honeymoon phase. I pushed it all away and took a risk. I admitted it to myself, and I told her.

She said it back, and the look in her eyes and the sound of those words confirmed everything I'd been feeling.

The way we feel about each other has only grown, every single day, since then. We cultivate it, we nourish it, and we fight for it. And in a few months I'm asking her to be my wife. At this moment we're texting each other outlandish names for our future children. And tonight I'll curl up next to her thinking I couldn't possibly love her any more than I do at that moment. And I'll wake up tomorrow morning being proven wrong as soon as I see her face."
593,"No you can't.  Speaking as someone who always focused more on learning over socializing growing up, I can confidently state that socializing is a learned skill that is significantly harder to learn later in life than most other skills.

Not saying some people don't over prioritize socializing as kids, but it is really easy to under prioritize it."
594,Dude noooo you should’ve let her know you were in training and that shes fucking insane so hopefully next time she doesn’t fucking burn the next guy’s jacket. Wtf
595,"I see that now, and it’s still sad to think about.

“I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you left them”"
596,My God... lol! I would have left him at the casino after the concert. 
597,"I've heard it from both men and women and it's annoying as hell. I've been told I have rbf when I'm simply maintaining a neutral expression. I also don't really do toothy smiles, because I'm insecure about my teeth."
598,My sister was given potato mashing duty at christmas and she mashed them all with dairy milk all knowing I'm lactose intolerant. The potatoes are the best part :( 
599,"That’s my view. That nobody starts out being an asshole, they act like one for a reason. If you can find a reason, then they don’t really seem like much of an asshole anymore."
600,"Not the date herself. Her Ex was at the bar and grill we went on for our first date. They had split about 3 months earlier. He walks over, says ""Hi, good to see you're doing well"" to her. Looks at me, and says ""Your shirt is stupid"", it was a grey and black long sleeve baseball style shirt. I just said ""Hey man, I'm sorry you're having a bad night, I hope it gets better"". 

What a strange insult. "
601,"Heh - my girlfriend at the time had a major blow up after she asked if I watched porn and I told her I did.

It weirded me out that she even asked such a personal question, and I was floored by her reaction.

But wht really weirded me out and made me end the relationship was that she then tried to demand that I stop using porn - basically, she wanted to be in charge of what I watch/how I masturbate.

That level of insecurity/controlling behavior instantly killed any interest I had in her...after that, even touching her squicked me out."
602,"Woman here. 


I checked your photos. You are attractive (maybe even a little bit above, your looks are not a problem) and seem interesting. 


If you are using Tinder sometimes the conversation is very boring, because one person doesn't joke. Maybe after a few lines, invite a girl for a coffee? "
603,bophades nuts?
604,"Yep. Really attractive girl, asked if she could move in with me after one date because she ""just couldn't stay at her dad's anymore"".

I have never noped out of anywhere that quick."
605,"The permanent record today is Google, and potentially employers are going to see all your edgy faux bigoted crap you spewed online as tween."
606,"Kissing my ass

Lliteraly. I was in the school library and heard some shuffling behind med and felt something bumping into my butt. I look and lo and behold she is kissing my clothed butt. "
607,"If she was a dude she’d already have a sexual harassment claim against her, probably by multiple people in the office."
608,He headbutted her.
609,I aswell have no issues with anger. Every tine someone is angry I ask them the question is anger going to fix it. Possibly one of the best questions to ask an angry person.

612,"I’m the oldest of five girls, and my Dad loves going to this type of stuff with us!
Now that we’re all adults we mostly choose things we know he likes but would never go to on his own, so usually high tea followed by pedicures. 
"
613,Ask your mom. 
614,"Met a nice young lady while out and about one day. We had a little spark, and on a whim I asked if she'd like to grab a drink sometime soon for a casual date. She readily accepted, we texted before the date, and showed up on time. All signals positive. 

That was when I made the mistake of confessing my love of girly drinks. Who doesn't love a good cosmo? I don't fucking care if Maxim called it the number one drink a man should never order. It's delicious and packs a whollop. 

Anyway. This SJW was *fuckingggggggg triggered* by my use of the term girly drink. She wouldn't let it go, and quickly launched into all this horrible baggage about what her daddy used to say or do and bla bla bla. It was the first time I've actually seen someone be *triggered* in the sense that she saw red and got launched into a mode where I represented the sins of her father. 

Naturally, she was keen to split the bill when I noped out of there."
615,"I was born 11:33 in the morning. 11+33 = 44. 4 sounds a lot like death in Chinese, so I am double death. And because the Illuminati is a quite nefarious and evil organization, I am unwittingly a big symbol within their organization. 

On my birthday they offered me 4000 souls in tribute and as a token of goodwill. "
616,"I was confused because I read ""tried to **tip** the waitress twice."" 

I was like oh, so he gave her a tip and then tried to give her *the tip*?"
617,"Take a look at this guy with his “personal FBI stalker”

Think you some kind of big shot eh?"
618,"I think you mushed the words ""incompetent"" and ""incapacitated"" and I love it. "
619,"This is what I'm going to do, thanks man. Shes just very impulsive and I've seen her fly off the handle at another female co worker so I've really gotta proceed with caution."
620,"Since I left high school I’ve had no friendship last 2 years.  Most don’t even last 3 months. 

Literally everyone I spoke to prior to 2017 I no longer talk to besides my ex. And everyone I talk to now I didn’t know 12 months ago.  


I only worry when I get married I won’t have anyone to invite. "
621,"Thumb on top, dick resting on the index finger below. It's not a firm grasp, just enough to prevent it from moving while peeing."
622,I felt like a total prick when I realized that naptime as a kid (which I was *belligerent* in my opposition to when I was 3) was to give *my mom* a break; it had nothing to do with me being tired.

624,"Cats and those expensive bath bombs from lush, I work in the rail industry and often have to explain to people why I’m so glittery "
625,"Welp, there I go crying again. "
626,"You know what's interesting - I was reading about different cultural words for partial things like colour, left, right, up, down etc. I found there was a tribal people who wouldn't use left and right like we understand, but would say North, South, East, West. As in: ""North of that item, South West of that tree, hand me the tool to my East.

These people were so aware of their surroundings and directional capability that it didn't matter if it was night or overcast, they could tell where they were and direction they were facing.

I can't remember who they were, but maybe that's how humans should naturally tell direction and you're more attuned to our past?"

629,This was happening to me a lot. Not matter what I did it felt like I was walking on eggshells. Couldn’t spend one night together without getting in some ridiculous fight. Eventually we broke up. Pretty sure we have different emotional needs and she was sensitive as hell
630,It really makes me want to return some video tapes 
631,"It's weird, right?  I've come across this a couple times from people visiting Texas.

There's just no stigma whatsoever about margaritas in Texas.  Everyone enjoys them."

633,If you happen to live in Portland that may very well be my sister.
634,"""Next"""
635,"Similar to u/jollyrogerninja, I had class in college with a girl that was initially very pretty. This class was an elective for me and I noticed that everyone avoided her like the plague (her and most of the other students were part of that major), which seemed weird for a really cute girl. I got paired with her for an assignment cause no one else wanted to join her. Everything seemed fine for a while, than she wanted to play bloody knuckles (which is a weird thing to want to do for an upper year college student). She then feigned stabbing me with a compass (the mathematical kind, we were doing triangulations) and then played it off as a joke, then said I was ""insecure"" when I didn't find it as funny as her."
636,My boyfriend says this every time I ask... kinda suspicious but it shuts me up. Perfect answer.
637,"Drawing and painting. In school it was always portrayed as a feminine activity, but I'll be damned if I don't sit down at least once a week near a creek or river with a fishing pole, some beer, a pad and my pencils, and just draw to clear my head. It's so relaxing. And it's cool to look back on later and know how you were feeling when you were drawing. I've got like 12 different drawing if the same location and all of them look different, not only because of the time between them, but I can tell by some of my color choices what my mood was"
638,Mean Girls is flawless.

640,Sometimes you can't deal with the crazy further or they'll get their hooks in yah.

642,"See this is a male viewpoint because we work very hard to get *a* woman. So why would women need to compete when it's so easy for then to just get a man?

They aren't competing to get *a* man.

They are competing to get *the best* man."
643,"She pulled out her ponytail and threw her hair around like she was some kinda metal guitarist.

That and when you're sitting in a chair, and she says ""whatcha doin'?"" as she places her boobs behind your head so you can be blissfully aware of their presence"
644,"I had a girl one time where we just went on a typical first date. All goes well yadda yadda she asked if I wanted to get to her place so I was down since she seemed chill.

We get there and it's all normal. We relax and talk, them I go to the bathroom. When I come out she's got alcohol out. She's already cracked it open and started but didn't seem like she's done alot yet. She offered me some, to which I said I don't drink because of personal reasons. She says okay and on goes the night.

However she must have either been a lightweight or she drank a lot more than I realized cause she was almost gone within 30 minutes. A completely different person, slurring and stumbling and all that. She tries to get me to have sex with her eventually to which I declined because I don't really enjoy fucking people who are drunk like she was, on top of the potential legal issues that could happen.

However her response went something along the lines of ""You're like the first guy to ever deny having sex with me. It kinda makes me sad."" To which I try explaining why I declined it, after which she responded with ""Whatever, I'll just get someone else to fuck me then"" and got on her phone.

Naturally I'm pissed, I get my coat and my keys and leave without saying a word. Then she had the audacity to text me afterwards and say how I wasn't man enough cause I didn't comfort her when she was sad and how I was supposed to know she said that to hide her insecurity or whatever after just one day.

TL;DR: Had a good date with a girl and went back to her house. She got piss drunk and I denied sex because of reasons, then she basically attacked me by calling me ""not a real man"" for not comforting her"

655,"It actually becomes a sport when you become a Dad. Just how much can you embarrass the shit out of your kids. 

As cliche as it is, I found that there is a kind of ""switch"" that goes off when you become a parent. I have literally no ego around my kids. I don't give a fuck what they think of me. All that matters to me is that they are happy and healthy. They can hate my guts for all I care, as long as they're happy, I'm happy. 

And being around someone else and having no ego is a bizarre but very freeing thing. That lets you get away with doing stupid embarrassing shit and enjoying it."
656,She was the Loch Ness monster
657,"I have zero anger issues as well, and have begun to wonder if it's not actually a detriment.  I don't mean those with anger issues that try and fight everything that moves.  I mean getting upset about legitimate things that hurt you.  Like somebody taking credit for your work, or your SO just constantly not showing affection...

tl:dr; There's a differnece between anger issues and being a doormat."

671,"Yeah. Ten years ago I met a really attractive girl at school, didn’t have any classes with her. I worked up the courage my 16 year old self needed to say hi. Instantly she seemed interested in me, which was cool at the moment...

This was during the MySpace days. I go home and she adds me on MySpace. After I’ve added her, I look at her profile a few minutes later. Much to my surprise, I’m # 1 on her “top 8” list.. which really threw me off. She begins to message me constantly, telling me this was all fate. Told me she had known about me for a long time and had a huge crush, and that my “last name would flow really with her first name.” 

I began to have shorter replies, until I stopped completely. About a year passes and we go back to school. I had gotten a girlfriend over the summer. My first day back I was walking through the hallway to get to a class. The “creepy girl” shouted my name, and I turned around and looked back. She sprinted up to me throwing her arms around me, and gave me a big kiss on the lips. I awkwardly go the hell outta there.

Another year passes; I’m fresh outta high school, recently single, and horny. Randomly I see a picture of her on social media, and wtfff she got hot. Against my better judgment I text the girl. She responds immediately saying she wants to hang out that night. I got her ice cream and then she gives me a blow job in my car. I spend about another hour or so with her,  not wanting to be rude. At this point it’s 1 or so in the morning, and she refuses to show me how to get back to her house for about an hour.. so I sat there in my car awkwardly arguing with her “playfully”, asking where to drop her off. I drop her off home finally. The end. 

She might’ve been a little creepy and came on strong, but I was the real weirdo. Pretty shitty thing of me to do. Have grown up a lot since then and not proud. Last I saw she was happily engaged, so hopefully life continues to go well for her.

694,"Physically it doesn't feel like anything - ideally you shouldn't be particularly hungry throughout the cutting process unless you're getting wayyy down to competition bodybuilder fat levels. So just a six pack should still be pretty well fed.  

By psychologically having a six pack feels incredible. Even being underneath your clothes where it's invisible it feels almost like carrying around a $100 bill that no one can see. It's the good kind of feeling that permeates into your other feelings throughout the day. 

Don't get me wrong, having a six pack in itself won't alter your life for the better. But the process of getting the six pack teaches you a lot about discipline in a way that's applicable to anything, and just having it is a sign of general competence. A lot of different things meet that same description."

So weird stuff kept happening while we were dating.   Supposed stalker ex-boyfriends kept showing up at her apartment. but no one ever saw them.

So over the next 2 weeks,  I talk about how we should get married but to make sure that we are taken care of I am going to join the Navy.   So needless to say we \*\*\*\* like rabbits until I ship out then I pull the mother of all ghosts.   I got some official looking stationary from the NEX typed up a letter saying that I died in a training accident and that I was sorry for her loss.   Unfortunately, as she was not a married dependent she was not entitled to any benefits etc.     


The next phone call I made home to my mom I told her everything that went down and about the letter and to play along with the faked death thing.

There was never one with all my parents friends.

722,"After my ex and I broke up I was devastated for a few months, so I made a promise to myself that I wasn’t going to let myself wallow in self pity any longer. I was going to better myself and find someone else.

I started running each day (I most definitely was not a “runner”). While running I found that if I thought about how out of shape I was/how gross I looked/what a new hot girl would think if they saw me naked, I would push myself harder to go that extra lap or go run even if it was raining or snowing. I also started eating a lot better for the same reasons. I dropped 50lbs over the course of a year, which gave me a huge self confidence boost. 

I have always loved listening to people play guitar but I never knew how. Well all my nights were free, so I picked up a cheap guitar and I made another promise to myself that the first month I would practice for at least an hour before I turned on the TV or did anything. I fell in love with it and didn’t use my TV at all for 3 months. Now I can actually play along to some songs and actually enjoy learning something new. 

Just making yourself better in all aspects helps you forget that you are lonely. But being lonely is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. 

Also... lots of tequila. "
723,"i live with a guy who doesn't work, but still for some reason will wake up and put on shirt, pants, belt, socks, shoes, and won't change until he goes to bed. The dude does nothing but sit around and watch sports/news all fucking day, with an occasional dog walk. 

He's insane."
724,"I get all kind of weird signals from women, it's strange! Anything up to and including ""I want to fuck you"" has actually meant ""I don't want to fuck you"". Thoroughly confusing creatures."
725,This is awesome. My husband asked me if he could see me again in a similar way at the end of our first date- warms my heart up every time I think about it.
726,They made me fill out a form so that I could get some money back
727,Make sure to maintain eye contact to establish dominance
728,I don’t have any confidence and I hate pictures of myself 
729,Well I have a new kink 
730,"My roommate and I, both dudes in college absolutely love watching romcoms and getting sloshed on bottles of ~~wine~~ erm whiskey. "
731,"Before my girlfriend and I were dating I would dog sit for her and her family. I would simply come visit, give them a treat each, let them out, and MAYBE hang out for more than 10 minutes since that's all they asked of me.

My girlfriend's dog absolutely LOVES me and will choose me over her all the time, and she rescued her off the side of the road in horrible condition years ago. Don't get me wrong, she loves her momma, but she adores me. 

Even funnier (to me at least), she hated her previous boyfriend. Her extended family only met me once prior and remembered me as ""the one the dog liked"" lol."
732,We were at the reception after my cousins wedding. The girl was stroking my arm and staring at me while I was talking to her dad. She then asked “What’s you’re favorite animal?” And tried to make out with me. In front of her dad.
733,Feel you! Its hard sometimes cause other people dont seem to do that very often.
734,"Cranberry Pineapple Juice (the cranberry brand has a diet for 5 calories) + Malibu Coconut Rum 

Enjoy that girly cocktail that I love 

Another is Pink Rose + Peach Vodka + Top off with Sprite &amp; Ice "
735,My husband is the same way. He's down to just his underwear before the makes it into the living room... I have to warn him ahead of time if I have people over so he doesn't end up half naked in front of guests 
736,Eah eah uh uh eah eah uh uh
737,Straight is almost always the best option. There can be no way of taking it a different way. If you kinda beat around the bush to me you are just going to kick the can down the road
738,"As a single dude, feels goooood. Even simple things like changing my shirt after co-ed floor hockey is a coincidence boost when you notice ladies checking you out. And the first time you're about to have sex with a new partner, taking off your shirt makes them pretty much jump you."
739,Poor guy is probably so confused by how angry she is at him for no reason. 
740,/r/nocontext  
741,That’s y u gotta get that time delay poison
742,"It wasn't what my date did, but what an elderly couple did.

My ex and I went to a local restaurant before my senior year prom, and she was wearing this gorgeous off-white/pale pink dress. We were eating and having a great time together when this elderly couple came up to us. They told us how beautiful she was and how cute we were together, and then gave each of us $50 and left. We were completely surprised"
743,Wth. That's terrible
744,"Find the right wallet?  It’s a known fact that a wallet spawns in a guy’s pocket when he hits puberty. 

Still using the same one I’ve always had, much to the dismay of my fiancé who bought me a monogrammed one.."
745,Welp that's enough internet for today
746,"When I was 18, before my ex and I started dating, there was one time I was around her and her friends at a pizza shop. She looked up at me and tested her hand flat on my chest and just left it there for a few seconds.

Chalk it up to me being a virgin then or the fact that we hadn't even kissed by that point but that was up there with the strongest butterflies I ever had"
747,"If you're attractive to her, she is not offended.  If you are not attractive to her, she is offended."
748,Unwanted sexual advances are harassment.  Fuck her feelings.  Tell your manager.  It's not your job to deal with crazy.
749,A projector that puts an 80inch screen on the ceiling above my bed. Great for when I am alone or when I have company. 
750,Doggy because ass
751,"First and foremost, childbirth is hard on the body. My partner lost the ability to orgasm for like a year and libido dropped. Then there's the stress of the constant attention a newborn needs. Lack of sleep and all that.  Then there's what I call ""mom-mode"" that's not exactly sexy. Women have to learn to switch between mom-mode and girlfriend mode. Setting up date nights helps. Try to have a good support network. Like a sibling or parent of yours who can babysit for free relatively often. You CAN get best of both worlds (kids and romantic partner), but you have to work at it. "
752,This is the real question! 
753,I've infected my children with this. As soon as the door closes 4 of us are stripping down to underwear and the wife is shaking her head.
754,My wife left me
755,"The way I see it, my husband lets me be the jet pack "
756,Wouldn’t you rather she entertain your children?
757,"Oh yeah, I'd say its to die for. "
758,"What are crusties actually like? I'm interested.

Crusties in my town aren't that common and the ones that do identify with that are pretty well kept. "
759,"""You like that, you fucking retard?"" "
760,"I've been dating my crush for a few weeks now. The most we've done is a hug. But yesterday she said, ""Your hand... looks really heavy. let me hold it for you :)"" and right then and there my heart just fucking melted. She was embarrassed it was too cheesy but I thought it was adorable"
761,"If you need a rational explanation to get to “I shouldn’t burn a dude’s clothes after he doesn’t text me,” you are not a rational person to begin with. "
762,"I haven't been home in a while since my boyfriend's place is a shorter commute to school and work, and when I came in yesterday night my dog barked and semi-attacked me like I was a stranger. Broke my heart. He didn't even apologize"
763,"Same, too both"
764,"I would like to hear more about this ex, it seems you've a story to tell sir "
765,My cat was sitting with his butt in my face when I woke up today.
766,"It ain’t long, but it’s thin."
767,"I was studying at the uni library, and she sat herself at the same table as me. I had seen her around a few times, just enough to think “oh she’s cute” and move on. I noticed her cursing under her breath, and noticed she was stuck on some mathematics problem. I was studying physics, so math wasn’t an issue for me and I proceeded to ask if she needed help. She said yes, and that was that, I helped her out for the next few weeks, same time, same place. 

Fast forward around 3 months (I had thought about her romantically, but never saw any interest from her, or so I thought), she and I were still doing maths stuff together but it was becoming less and less about maths, more us just hanging out. A bit later, I found out from someone else studying her subject that their maths course had already finished, and she was just using that as a pretense to hang out. 

At our next meeting, I asked her about it and asked her out on a date. It’s nearly 6 years later and still going strong as ever. "
768,"Mine waits until an attractive women is walking towards me, then stops to drop a deuce. "
769,"I don't know how much that really applies anymore though. Now with the prevalence of social media, the stupid things you do as a teenager stick around. It's a real bummer. We should all be free to be complete morons as teenagers."
770,"I was going on a first date off tinder a little over a year ago. Guy shows up at my house where he was going to pick me up and we were gonna take his dog to a nearby dog park and get coffee.

Guy rolls up, texts be that he feels embarrassed but he really needs to use the bathroom, so my dumbass lets him in. He smells to high he'll and he didn't have a dog. He pulls out a can of cream of chicken soup and exclaims he brought dinner. He was really sexually forward and scared the hell out of me so I just let him go about hearing up the can on my stove while I stayed as far away as possible and planned my escape. Eventually he started making his way towards my bedroom and claim how excited he was to slip in my sheets. 

That was when I shouted he needed to get out before I called the cops. He pitched a fit but did technically leave just really slowly all the while calling me a cunt for not letting him sleep at my place and now he's have to drive the 2 hours back to his mom's house."
771,For me it started tapering off around 23. I'm still an idiot though
772,You'd think. I took a 2nd date and she then stalked me for 3 months. Worse decision in my life. 
773,"One of my asshole cats once ran up to me, sneezed in my face and then ran away. I miss you Rizzo "
774,"&gt; ""guys only want one thing""

To be fair that did give us a fantastic meme to enjoy.
"
775,"I hear you.  I worked as a stock boy on the loading dock in a department store years ago.  I got laughed at too, but one day I saw a contractor stretching his legs on the floor.   He said something similar to ""They can laugh.  I'm not going home with a back ache""."
776,"Ha.  I remember being declared an official ""Responsible Adult.""  Worst day of my life.  ;)

More seriously, I remember there being a group of women who would refer to the dads as ""dogs"" - for ""Dads of Girl Scouts.""  This ended when my wife told them, ""So that would make you the bitches?"""
777,LMFAO! What a fucking psycho 
778,Bubblebaths! I don’t know who decided that a man couldn’t soak in hot water with good smelling soaps and some light music playing 
779,"Ehh, I'd say you're doing alright then. We don't get to see ourselves from the outside very often, so as long as you're at least attempting to show maturity, you likely are doing better than you think.

Its like seeing an unexpected photo of yourself vs. looking in the mirror. Totally different."
780,"Last weekend. My housemate was away visiting her parents, and I was ill, so I stayed in all weekend playing video games and watching Punisher. Aside from the illness it was a great weekend."
781,"We met on study abroad trip. Fast forward a few months later, and she hits me up out of the blue  to hang out.

It went well, til it was time to drop her off at her house. She shared the house with a mutual friend that we had met on the same trip. A nice, mild mannered guy that I got along with really well.

I went to pull into the driveway, but she asked me to drive around back and park on the street. Weird. But ok.

We chatted in the car for a minute, and she invited me in. Just as we were about to get out of the car, the roommate's car rolled up. According to what she had said earlier, he wasn't supposed to be in town.

I said, ""Oh cool, Blah is here, It'll be good to see him again.""

Suddenly, she said that she had to go, and that I should go too, because Blah ""really doesn't like unexpected company"".

Oh, ok...

Believe it or not it didn't hit me for another hour what the situation really was. In hindsight I should have told Blah what she was up to, but I just walked away from it."
782,Every other day when I was married.  Divorced now.
783,"It's not that hard. I got the one that says ""Bad Motherfucker"" on it."
784,How willing you are to go to jail for murdering every 13 year old boy on the planet.
785,"Be like me...

Girls (and everyone else) refer to me as ""the ugly one""

"
786,The irony is that I have never played a game of basketball in my life.
787,I've found that. Because when I wear my comfy trousers I am lying on my bed with my laptop. When I wear my jeans I don't like doing that because they aren't very comfortable. When I'm in my jeans I just feel more like I have to do shit.
788,Nope I stay in my jeans t-shirt and sneakers until Im ready to go to sleep unless I feel particularly gross.
789,Not who you wanted but who you needed
790,"Its definitely up there. 

But have you ever seen a perfectly golden crisp grilled cheese sandwich? "
791,Watch out for that side eye. I used to keep an African gray. If she would close her eyes with her head down it would be safe for scratches. If she watched me with one eye it was bitey time. 
792,"""Don't worry about him. We're just friends."" "
793,"&gt;he's new in town

What are 3 other things about him? "
794,"If you think about it, most of the shit that’s “girly” has nothing essentially feminine to it. We just associate it with women so it’s “girly”. Riding horses? Used to be for men. Pink? Men used to wear it all the time with no qualms. Even more stereotypically girly drinks. Like, oh nooooo, my cocktail is a cool color and has sugar in it. Last I checked, men like color and sugar too. "
795,"So you like ghosted her but still saw her at school? Death glare justified, ghosting sucks. "
796,"I sit down when I pee, 
There ain’t nobody else like me.
I’m just takin’ a whiz, mind your own biz!
Why is everybody always looking at me!?"
797,"I have some more vacation days than my wife has so this year I had 4 left over from 2018 that I had to use in January. So I did a “solocation” to Florida. 

It was nice and really chill, just read and sat by the beach, saw a movie and relaxed. We have no kids so it’s easier now. 

To be honest though after the first day I just wished my wife was there as doing stuff on your own can be pretty boring and awkward (dinner alone, bar alone, exploring a city alone etc)."
798,"Sadly, that was high school, and it's my biggest regret that we're not."
799,Sounds like you found a keeper my guy. GG this guy wins.
800,"You got it boy. Keep doing what you like!

Ps: Dick is good too"
801,"Some guys aren't into casual sex, myself included. I had that feeling twice before and pretty much accepted that casual sex wasn't worth it to me. Just left me feeling like I wanted her to go home and I didn't like that feeling."
802,That's not sad. 
803,"Her daughter.  I knew she had a daughter, and that didn't shut things down.  What shut things down was a combination of a couple of things.  

One, I don't want to meet your kid on the first date, period.  I am only interested in getting to know you, and I don't know what expectations the kid may develop from that meeting.  Children don't need to meet Mommy's (or Daddy's) fuck buddy or date for the night.  

Two, I am a father, and I tend to try to always bring myself down to the kids level when I talk to them.  I did the same with this little girl that answered the door, ""I'm smokecheck, is your mommy home?""  To which, this little girl of a bout 7 years old answered, ""You just want to fuck my mom!""  In those exact words.  I just got up and left.  I don't need that possibly around my kids, and it didn't reflect well on the woman."
804,"Whenever I orgasm, I get really into the idea of running. I'm like FUCK SAKE, I NEED TO RUN. 

Then I run, who am I running from?

Myself."
805,Handsy.
806,"My muscles. In HS used to be like 190, all fat. Now less than 10 years later I'm around 215 with a very good strength base and solid muscle size. 17.25 inch arms when flexing, and I shave or trim most of my body hair (trim arms and legs and ass) to show a lot more muscle definition.

Definately could lose some more fat but I've come a long way from being sad about going to the beach. 

Remember guys, hard work pays off, and 8/10 women will find muscularity attractive. Hit the gym and get lifting and trust me you WILL see the progress and you WILL gain more confidence!"
807,Is your wife single?
808,Same. I hated the idea of being best friends with someone and then suddenly not talk anymore. Even though nothing happened.
809,I got super into latch hooking this winter. About to finish up my snowman maybe this weekend
810,Sneakers? Inside?
811,"I'm not a dude but my stepdad actually has tons of traditionally feminine hobbies and skills! He bakes (he used to own a bakery in fact), he sews, I believe he can crochet too, and for some ungodly reason, he *really* seems to enjoy doing laundry? I used to think he just did it cuz he thought he had to when he first moved in but no, somehow he finds it enjoyable.

He's incredible at it, too; the man can get stains out of anything. Which is a godsend cuz the rest of us are slobs.

My biological dad used to wear nightgowns to bed. He loved the flannel ones. Comfy AND toasty! 

Do you, men! The patriarchy and toxic masculinity hurt you, too. "
812,How they are somehow always cold
813,"My ex got a $600 self cleaning litter box for my cat when I was living in a studio apartment, it’s about the size of a small igloo (it fit in my closet where the water heater was) but when I moved to my new place the only spot that I could put it in was the laundry room, apparently my cat didn’t like the sound of the washer so she shit on my carpet instead, so I tried to get a normal (smaller) litter box which also for some reason made her want to shit on said carpet. Now I have a rotating shit cabin in the corner of my kitchen, which she enjoys and uses respectfully. "
814,absolutely fam.
815,"In the culture that I grew up in people don’t smile as much in public. Since I have moved to North America people have asked me if everything is ok  a couple of times.

I’m not smiling. Did you say something funny? Then why would I be smiling?"
816,"Yoda. Guy was 900 years old, imagine the things he could teach you"
817,"Exactly. Nothing more manly than Bros prostate massaging each other. After all, there are no women involved.

Strapon with the gf ( or if she has a dick ) is also a thing."
818,"Oh, sure. I had a crush on this girl I knew in college. But she made it very clear, pretty insistently, that she wanted to have a threesome with me and my roommate, which kind of creeped me out."
819,Cheers from Iraq!
820,"Sawdust does smell nice though. 

Cedar, wood smoke, pine, sea spray, leather, bourbon,... and that’s just what I’m currently sporting at home. "
821,"Wish I could upvote this twice. I went through that two years ago. It's still a lot of work, but the worst is over. Good luck on the journey"
822,"If girls are calling you cute at 23, you're in for a pretty good life mate. But if you want them to sexualise you more as well as seeing you as approachable, sweet and endearing - then sexualise yourself more. Work more masculine style of clothing and grooming into your presentation, make sure your posture is A+ and get fit. That should really help - you're about to hit cruising altitude by about 25 and if you do all this, you'll be very highly sought after."
823,r/yesyesyesno
824,"Met this guy James in the 7th grade because I had broken my leg so I needed to move my seat closer to the door, so that I could leave the classroom easier. I sat next to him so we started talking. 

Now we’re both 30 and hang out once a week. "
825,"What about book clubs, never been in one. Since I'm a massive reader I want the experience "
826,I left my open for five seconds and my pom peed all over my bed :(
827,"Not really recommended in the current meta, most players don't carry much currency any more and the GMs will ban you if you don't get your skill up fast enough"
828,"Id rather make people laugh than hurt them, personally. "
829,Went on a date. Girl was super cool. Normal date at the bar. Had some drinks and even got a kiss before leaving. Later that week she came to my place and we just hung out and watched tv on my couch. Kissed a little bit and planned to go to a baseball game later the next week or something. Texted her maybe 2-3 times over the course of the next few days but Never heard from her again. No big deal figured she just was busy or wasn’t interested and I left it at that and moved on. I’m from USA. About a month later I saw in fb she moved to japan. Maybe like a month after that she got married. And probably a month after that she was pregnant. Pretty sure she was seeing someone at the time that was in the military. Felt pretty bad about that one
830,My life is finally getting back on track after five years of stressful growing up.
