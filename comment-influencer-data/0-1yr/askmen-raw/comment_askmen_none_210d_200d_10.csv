11,"Just speaking as a gay guy, some of the most attractive guys I know are like 5’6” and it has nothing to do with height. It has to do with their “manliness,” work ethic, self esteem, ability to converse, and sense of humor. Personality is truly 85% of what makes a guy attractive, the other 15% is just not being a greasy fat ass with fat tits"
12,"Well, hang in there ! "
13,"God I need one of these again.

A year after my ex dumped me a regular on a forum I was a member of suggested we meet up for a drink.

So one night we met up at a trashy bar, talked to they closed and she suggested we go back to my place for another drink. I was tired but why not? Less than an hour later she's begging me to fuck her.

We had a strictly FWB situation for almost a year, and I ended up living with her for a couple months. Eventually she started to want more and I didn't see a relationship with her working out since we disagreed on a lot of things. We parted on good terms.

She was the last woman I kissed, that was three years ago. After a string of rejections and one really bad one a few months ago, I need a good fuck to get out of my funk."

22,"My hair. But nobody understands the pain I went through. At one point, it was so dense and thick that none of the combs in my house would fit to comb the hair all the way through. I hated it for the first 17 years of my life atleast and stopped washing the hair frequently. Eventually it thinned out on it's own and it's much better now but still, It never stays the way I want it :|"
23,Even if you KNOW that she is into you the answer is still to stay friends. It will make your life far more complicated than you want it to be to date someone you work with.
24,"Appreciation

25,"6 years difference. There is a noticeable, but not jarring, generation gap. Movies and music that impacted my youth have little bearing on her as she was mostly grown at the time, etc. Likewise the other way around, music and stuff that was 'the thing' when she was young I only heard about later. So as such she identifies slightly more with the  very late baby boomers (or whatever was before Gen X) rather than Gen X like myself.

As for *unforeseen things* the biggest was children. I was late to that party, not wanting them in my life until I was well into my thirties. (some of us just aren't ready until we're ready.) She was burning through her early/mid forties by then, so adoption of an older child 'to make up for lost time' was our only real option. No regrets, though, our adopted daughter is freaking awesome, and we got to skip the messy poopy diaper stages."

29,"It depends on the class of venue you're looking at. A place where shit regularly gets out of hand it might be an issue, even if you're built. A place where the bouncer checks IDs 99% of the time, it's not a big deal.

35,"yeah.. not dating more than one person at a time has nothing to do with a ""soulmate"" "
36,"Yeah--it's one of those things that you can't do much for--just is what it is.     
Just work on the other angles--how you dress, carry yourself, and work on how you talk to people.       
This stuff will help now and, later, you'll be killer.      
Maybe start off with, ""Hi, I'm mashonem.  Oh, whoops, it looks like I just dropped my 401k card.""      
Sure, maybe she'll know that that isn't really a thing or that it's just a coaster you wrote 401k on but she'll know that you at least have heard the term which means you're not a child.        
Or don't do that at all--what do I know?  Just some idiot on the internet.     
Probably don't do that.  "
37,Yeah I'm definitely considering it. But we live in a shallow world and I don't want the training to be for nothing.

Rule #1, never shit where you eat. Meaning, unless you don't mind the idea of being fired for sexual harassment, never date anyone from work, period. 

Are there exceptions, yes, but they are very few and very specific. Don't assume you are the exception to the rule. Don't let your little head think for your big head. "

41,Seriously. Who uses pens anymore?
42," &gt; I feel like if a guy says it to a girl, it’s the male version of “You’re like a brother to me!”.

Not necessarily. I once said it to a woman I was dating when we were trying to organise our second date. I travel a lot for work during the week but we had talked about meeting up one night after work. She then suggested we meet up on the weekend so I could spend my weeknights resting.

I told her that she was sweet for suggesting that."

46,"I see, but I didn’t break up with him :( He broke up with me and I agreed to make it less painful for him. I just want him to get better. "
47,Then give him the space he needs to work on himself and if you end up getting back together later on then great otherwise it's best if you moved on.

Basic I know, but for real- to take time and create this menial thing we HAVE to do, and make it delicious and pleasant and creative and not ask for help (until I force her to let me help)... I just feel like I’m being romanced every time. And it’s always delicious. I hate cooking so since she loves it I’m happy :)"
56,I work days and my boyfriend works midnights. He calls me on his way home as I’m on my way to work and we talk every morning for 30 minutes and always wave at each other when we pass on the highway. It’s a really nice start to the day. 
57,"The first one is a girl breaking into an old, abandoned looking house, only to discover there’s an old blind woman living there with a VERY sharp sense of hearing. The girl gets scared and hides when the old woman hears her and starts making threats, bragging that she can zero in on a mouse’s heartbeat. The old lady promises to go easy on the girl if she comes out, but also says the longer she hides the worse it’ll be for her. I always wake up right before the lady finds the girl.

The second is me reading an untagged spoiler on /r/wow that one of my favorite WoW characters will end up getting killed off, which makes me mad until I wake up and realize it was just a dream. "

65,"He took the bins out on trash night. He doesn’t live with me, just happened to be over that night. "
66,"This really shouldn't be an unpopular opinion. How you look plays a huge role in how your actions are perceived. I have personally seen cute guys get away with what I would have called objectively creepy behavior, but since they were cute. The only thing I would add is it is more of a gender neutral thing. Guys are less likely to label behavior creepy, but what a girl can get away with also is related to how attractive she is. With girls what they do is labeled gross. Say for example a hot girl takes her top off at a party. It's considered sexy. A fat girl does the same and it's considered gross. A cute/hot guy plays with a girls hair it's being playful. A fat guy does it and it's creepy. Like I said how you look plays a large role in how you are perceived it's just different terminology is used for the genders. "
67,"The first road trip we took. I was driving. My then gf now wife was passenger. She put her arm around my shoulders and scratched my upper back and hairline.

68,Did you ever figure out what your condition is? 
69,"That meaning is different for everybody... for most people it means someone who matches the partners level of sexual promiscuity.

But a girl that is bad in bed is someone who doesn't return any foreplay and just lays there during sex like a dead rag doll and makes no noise. 
Also some women like to start talking during sex, like sexy talk is one thing, but like awkward jokes and off topic subjects are a big turn off during sex.

My personal experience of good sex is a girl who knows how to foreplay. Knows how to exchange oral sex. Knows what arouses them and can communicate it, it makes it possible to help them climax. A girl that can climax multiple times and isn't afraid to squirt. Knows how to talk dirty without it being weird. Also knows how to make me finish and has the ability to finish at the same time.

But keep in mind good sex comes with experience and commmunication. If partners don't communicate what gets them off its doomed. Everybody is different so knowing what the other person likes is 80% of it. Many inexperienced people don't know what they like and just need to figure it out."

77,"Damn. I miss her for you, bro."
78,"So many ways.  One ex came at a time when I had been single and promiscuous for *way* too long, and honestly felt like I could never trust people again because I had seen so much sketchiness in the hookup scene.  She was so real and pure and trusting that it not only forced me to be a much better person, it showed me that there were good people out there and I could trust people if I just found the right ones.  "
79,"My BF does a similar thing. He doesn’t think he should pay attention to me in a group setting and considers it needy if I tell him how I feel about it. He pushes me to interact with other girls or asks them to interact with me, making me even more uncomfortable and anxious. "
80,She made me think TWICE or more than that before I trust someone ever again.
81,"I have told him. I have begged him. We married in 2015, and were together about a year and a half before. When we were first together I was very up front with my emotional needs, and how I was “emotionally high maintenance, and needed a lot of attention/affection. Sadly, he just doesn’t get it. So... I’ve kinda numbed myself and given up. As a means to survive and self manage the levels of depression I experience. 

I’ve even told him, well, it’s not your fault... you just simply don’t have the ability to move me the way I need to be. I have told him this at least 4 different times. I don’t know why I stay... I guess, honestly... I’m just so damn tired. Hes not abusive. He’s not dangerous or have toxic habits or disrespectful. You know, it’s easy to leave a guy that’s blatantly in the wrong, but him, Every day is the same. Sadly, I just ended up with a guy who isn’t affectionate or even seem to need affection given to him. He seems very content, even knowing that I am broken and lonely and struggle not only with this weird fucked up relationship, but other life shit, on top of fighting a daily battle with depression. Believe me I have left myself very vulnerable to him, put out my best moves and got nothing back. We don’t have a sexual relationship as a result. 

I told myself recently, I can accept this life, as it is... but it doesn’t mean I have to be happy about it. I’m retiring my silly romantic ideas, hopes, dreams, desires that love will find me. I just want to get through the gosh darn day."

I went through a pretty rough breakup a few months ago that impacted me more than I let myself admit - and although it ended up being exactly the kind of slap in the face I needed to turn my life around and start being better, I miss all the little things. This thread is currently doing a decent job of filling that hole as I at least get to share in other's happiness about their relationships.

Was 6ish years ago at college, she was in another class and i liked her because she was different (and one of the very few girls in mech eng) and she also liked me (which i found out later)

She sent all the signs but me being the shy dude i was back then (and still am to an extent) didn't make any move. And then she quit college and started an apprenticeship, have no contact with her anymore, for 5 years now.

I mean, one time i was at her place and said i was bored, she teasingly poked me with her foot said ""i mean we could have sex"" and i replied ""haha yeah sure"" and kept watching the movie."

I have tattoos on my arms and one on my left leg (which can easily be covered by long sleeves and jeans/pants). My Mom doesn't like them. Not enough to disown me, but enough to be seriously upset if I got any more that were visible to her and/or that she's aware of.

On my upper body, I have 4 tattoos, and plan to get 2 more. If she ever found out, I would be disowned, and she would most likely never talk to me again for as long as she lives.

On another note, I wish I could tell my Mom I met a nice girl that I want to start a family with. One day!"

If the men are anything like I used to be it wouldn’t have crossed their minds that you not paying would make you feel bad. 

I’m not mega rich but well off and never really think about spending on dinner so I never had an issue with paying. The offer to pay would make me feel like I wasn’t being taken advantage off but i would still just go and pay. 

It wasn’t until my now wife waited until I popped to the loo to then pay that how she felt started to enter my mind. "
192,"The latest I've ever overslept for work was about 3 hours in my first year on the job. I woke up in a massive panic to 5 or so texts/calls from people at work asking if I was alright. I was honest with my boss at the time and told him I was so sorry I just overslept and was so sorry. He then took the brunt of the heat and told everyone else that I had previously told him I would be late and he just forgot. He was a BS'er but he had my back. I always appreciated that.

Furthermore though, that day I slept through a 6AM call with one of our Chinese suppliers. And, icing on the cake, it was my birthday lol.

214,"No offense but I just don't get why you (or anyone else in your position) still stays in such a marriage.

This has been going on for nearly a decade and from your posting history it seems like you are the only one fighting for your relationship. Why stay in a relationship if the other party simply does not give a fuck?

Also why do you claim that you won't ""be in the picture"" if you left her? No one is telling you to leave the country. You'll still see your children, in fact, men who actually fight for their children or better visitations usually get them. 

Don't let them grow up thinking that such an unhealthy marriage is something they should strive for.

Idk man, all I can say is that you deserve better. You seem like someone who has so much love to give and unfortunately you are stuck with someone who just does not want to receive any love. That's ok, go out and find someone who actually cares about you.

235,"Well my comment wasn't so much about you as it is more of the new guy.  Typically (in general), most guys don't want to be friends with a girl/woman.  They are wanting more.  So even though you are looking for one thing, he might not be.  Also, is he single?  That is another red flag to guys in a relationship.  Guys know how guys think.  I have seen relationships end because either party makes a new friend with a single person of opposite sex.  Guys and girls act differently.  If a guy wants you as a gf, he will slowly try talking you into doubting things.  It can be stressful on a relationship."

261,It's all about practice for you.  You are just going to need to get comfortable talking to random women in random places.  Start with small talk with cashiers at stores when they ring you up.  Go out to random places around town where there are lots of peopleand approach women and start random conversations by commenting on stuff around you and see how far you can take the chat.  The only way to get good at talking to women is by practicing talking to women.

I feigned some self confidence, and well, that’s how you talk to girls; just get over it and do it, but don’t force it. It has to be a casual comment or something, and see how they react. If they strike conversation back, continue it. If they don’t, don’t force it. The worst thing you can do is run up to a girl, and try to squeeze out a convo and make her feel uncomfortable. Keep it casual. For example, at the gym I would’ve said something as simple as “Good job” to a girl I’m familiar with, or something like “That looked tough!” etc And just end it there. See how they react, and work off of that. Never ever ever force it. Hope that helps. "

Personally I want my girl to be treated like a queen but if she insists to pay I’ll let her every once and awhile. I show my love and appreciation with gift giving, it’s my love language.

[article about best wax baths](https://www.verywellhealth.com/top-paraffin-baths-189408) You can use them on your feet, too. Really you could also smear some over any area if you make sure the wax isn’t too hot (backs and other areas don’t have as many nerves to detect burning, so be careful.)

The salon I go to for hair color and cut has a complementary paraffin wax treatment. They do it before you go under the dryer to set the color and wrap your hands in plastic gloves. Feels so good and also moisturizes."

413,"The first step part is actually very probable. I've never approached someone at a bar or club and it has a lot to do with my personality and emotional relationship to romance. Yes you could argue that women never do the first step but for me it's not because I expect someone to approach me but because I don't have interest in getting to know someone solely for the purpose of 'dating'. 


To be honest I've never went on a 'date' (apart from with my actual boyfriend) in my life. At least never intentionally. The only time I had a date was a time I thought it's just hanging out with a friend. I was kind of naive, going out to eat with a guy I've socialized with at a bar and thinking it's actual friends and buddies stuff. Haha that was awkward when he gave me a really long kiss on the cheek as goodbye. That's when I realized...


My approach to romance is actually knowing a person first as a friend and then developing interest and feelings towards each other. I don't like a romantical relationship with someone if that's the only kind of relationship we have. Going on a date with someone you don't know builds a relationship solely based on romantic interest, zero actual friendship. 


I think this may be similar for a lot of people actually wanting a meaningful relationship. That's why guys like that don't make first steps. Mutual love and attraction actually doesn't really require a first step as both parties just naturally get closer and closer to each other when they know each other well and start falling in love. "

It’s getting a little too perverted in the genre, to the point it’s out there publicly consistently where as the niche used to be for people who sought it out. 

No judgements but injecting it randomly where it doesn’t do anything for story or characters is just super odd putting.

After a life implosion I quit IT and started in a variety of customer service and admin jobs.  I've been trying to break through to the next level (currently a senior administrator but trying to get back into team leadership).  I have no chance of getting on the property ladder though - a small apartment now costs around £300k, and I have a daughter to support.

Also, it’s highly unlikely you do what they did because by all odds the technology improvement over time has vastly changed the skill or effort required to do what you do. Did you really think you’d just do what mommy and daddy did and everything would be fine? 

You’re a clear case of failure to adapt. 

Also the man you are calling “wrong” has everything you purport to want. I suspect that you’d do better finding out how I did it than throwing me shade for trying to explain to you why it’s your fault your life is going the way it is going.

Also back then the velour tracksuits were very in for women (pre-2004 they were popular with rap/hip hop heads but some reason took off with women especially middle/upper middle class women).  Paris Hilton and some others started wearing them and it blew up.  Juicy Couture decided to be cheeky and stamp their brand name on the ass.  I actually remember those pants being banned from school.

550,Clubs are the exception for me. It's definitely not my scene. 
551,"&gt; Why does every emotion need a resolution? Emotions are extremely complex and nuanced, a resolution for them is not always what you want/need. 

Because few emotions are good, it's basically happiness. If I'm sad, then I want to fix the cause that's making me sad. Same if I'm angry etc. Not fixing the root cause of my sadness made me go into a very deep depression, and I'm not very keen to do that again."

1. I will never date again just to have someone.

2. Although I have few standards, I will never again will not be with someone I do find at least average.

3. I will never date anyone again with depression who doesn't actively seek treatment and take medicine.

4. Controlling, cruel behaviors aren't a one off thing.

5. I won't date another person who has previously been raped.

6. If I have to wait for you to initiate sex but still do all the effort myself, no.

Currently still savoring being free about 18mo later. No plans to get a new girlfriend, loving being totally free. Booty calls and escorts got me covered; I'm having less sex, but it's with girls who actually bang back damn well, and I find genuinely attractive. Who cares if I'm only getting laid once a month now vs several times a week, the quality is well worth the decrease in quantity."

570,"&gt; bf refused to have sex with her and almost broke up until she begged and profusely apologized and reassured him how amazing he was

So many deadbedrooms where the man is the low libido are a result of his low sexual confidence, sometimes because of dick insecurities like this. Inviting that into your relationship carelessly is disastrous. Better to just treat the dick as sacred and never banter about it, the only words relating to it coming out of your mouth should be praise.

It's just safer this way. Even if it's kinda dumb to have to do."

Good - things will get better as you get older. Without being patronising, you’ll get teased for anything when you’re young/teenage, and it’s horrible at the time, but as everyone grows up, it’ll get better. 
People might be interested in your eyes, but adults bullying people is far rarer than kids doing it. It’s true that friends take the piss out of each other, but we try and avoid anything actually hurtful!

If you’re concerned with being attractive (who isn’t) then get as fit and healthy as you can - do that anyway, it’ll only make your life better. Unless you have other effects from the SJS that will affect this - apologies if you do.

Try and avoid killing yourself - you come across as intelligent and motivated, and that will stand you in good stead for a decent life.

This might come across as superficial and fake-motivational, but I’m being totally realistic."

In case if you don't know what SJS (Steven Johnson's Syndrome) is, it's a very rare (happens to average 3 people in a million) and dangerous skin deseas which either kills you or affects your organs, eyes, lips etc. TEN (Toxic Epidermal Nacrolysis) is the extreme version of SJS, my 85% skin was burnt.

So I was diagnosed with it when I was 6 months old. The doctor gave me a wrong treatment. I survived somehow. But it gave me many problems such as dry eyes, photo phobia, low vision. I spent 6 years in a blind boys hostel because no school wanted to admit me. I came back home when I was 12.

I have gotten bullied ever since. There are normal things that I can't do such as making eye contact (I can only do it when it's dark), crying etc.

Everyone always teases me about my eyes so I have stopped interacting with them. I don't like meeting new people because the first question everyone always asks is what is wrong with my eyes. I have been depressed ever since. I tried suicide when I was 13 but it didn't work out as my mom caught me (my luck lol). Forget about girl friends, I've never had a single female friend in my life (mostly for studying in an all boys hostel then an all boys school. Now I'm in co-ed school though).

I don't know if it's even possible for someone like me to get in a relationship so I don't even see that as a possibility (I'll call myself an asexual in future if someone asks me about It, job done).

So is there any advice you would like to give me? For having a good social life?

659,"Okay first off I wouldn't care how ""manly"" you appear to others but I believe confidence is what you are actually trying to build so here's what I'd suggest... 

1) take care of your health. Learn to lift heavy, sleep properly and eat well. No one cares how much you lift (again no one cares how much you lift). However, if you're body is treated right, you'll feel right and will naturally be more confident. No you don't have to be a bro either. Just go to the gym 3-5 days a week

2) try something new that's outside your comfort zone or seek a long time goal. Challenge creates strength and builds confidence. Sign up for that club, start a business, climb a mountain etc... You can do this as a controlled risk (starting small like talking to someone new). 

3) build or fix something. There's something to be said about physically creating something with your own hands. Could be an old bike, a drone, a car or even that squeaky bedpost 

4) find a male mentor or close friend. This is often the hardest part for others but a close friend will do wonders. I have hiking mentors, chruch mentors, triathlon mentors, leadership mentors, etc...they all push me and breed challenge. as mentioned before, challenge conquest creates conquest. 

5) go outside and experience life outside of a screen. I like the wilderness but getting out to park, nature trail or new pub all work 

Best of luck man and you'll fall into your own skin with time! If all else fails, a coffee on the summit of a mountain at sunrise tends to be my go to ;) "

in your case it might be little different but think on that  like this:

1. NO ONE going to laugh,and if someone will do that he's or her is piece of shit and you should ignore him
2. you doing it for your own health and people even look at you with admire that you take yourself seriously and improving you being 
3. back to the sentence in the start it will maybe be hard to keep up,you feel down but keep going no matter how you feel (mentally) ,just think of the good outcomes that you will benefit and there is ONLY benefits no bad ""side effects""...and who know maybe you will licking something else then honey (😉)"

670,"Have you asked her exactly what she needs when you go out? Ask her to imagine a scenario where you go out with a group and let her tell you how she would want the evening to go in a perfect world. 

In my case, the problem is I want him to occasionally “check in” while we’re out by coming over occasionally to give me a peck, squeeze my hand, just say “hey.” I do not want him attached to my hip, holding my hand the entire time and smothering me. However he cannot differentiate these two. When I ask him to check in, and explicitly state I don’t want him to stick to my side the entire time, he doesn’t get how they are different. And it just makes me sad that when we go out I can’t expect anything akin to the knee squeeze OP mentioned. It feels like I’m going out single. If we go out to dinner and I sit at the end of the table with someone across from me, facing me and him to my side, he will ask one of the girls at the table to switch seats with him, so they are next to me and he isn’t.

Just start out slow man. Go and walk on the treadmill and just look around. Get yourself comfortable in that environment and gradually move on to exercises that are intimidating. Most people at the gym are also happy to help. Having a gym buddy can help as well. "

It would be really good for your relationship if you just have an open, honest discussion. You can tell him why you feel insecure about it, and he can assure you that he doesn't mind. I know it can be hard, but talking about things that bother you, always makes it better."
684,"Koalas.

Here’s the copypasta:
&gt; Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

&gt; Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

I find myself noticing little things while driving around that relate to my work. Like a road near my house has something about 10 curb inlets all right next to each other. So I stop and wonder why it was designed like that. what kind of drainage problems did they run into that stopped them from having one low spot where all the water would go to. 

Little stuff like that. Every time I see something kind of wonky in the design of a site I try to think about why it was made that way. "

Never really got the parental check up and ask how I'm doing until WELL after. It's sad and it makes me sad.

I have told him this.  No, it isn't fair.  That doesn't matter, what matters is what it ""IS"".

You have to take a situation for what it is and adapt to it, not sit around wishing for the situation to suddenly become ""fair"", that isn't going to happen.

Is it fair that some of the guys are more athletic than you?  No.

So you either step up your game, accept being last picked, or just find something else to do.

You will almost never improve the ""fairness"" of the situation.

This applies, to work, dating, school, social outings, etc.  

You have to realize that it is all a game, you have to figure out how to adapt to the game, or you just stop playing it.

Some dude is better looking than you? So what?  You can't change that so work on shit you can change.  

Also remember to inventory your good traits, unless you are an autistic hunchback with with an earthworm fetish you have some and you should work on those.

Eventually I did my part and sucked it up and went to therapy. The fallback advice on all these posts is always counseling but there's a reason for that -- it usually works. Sometimes problems simply become bigger than two people alone can handle and an outsider's perspective is exactly what you need.

Other than that, during the good times, really make an active effort to cement your bond. Like I said, my husband do a lot together -- because we genuinely get along and enjoy each other's company. That tight friendship probably saved us. Build up that foundation so that when times get tough, your bond is strong enough to withstand it, if that makes sense. Once the lows pass, your connection will inevitably get stronger because you'll appreciate what you have and what you've overcome in order to have it :))"

Having a pub so close is fun in the beginning, but eventually it became a little annoying that I would lose at least one night of sleep every week because people were hanging out basically a few metres away from my bed. But hey, it's a student dorm, so what'ya gonna do? I just kind of arranged with the situation, because I also didn't want to be *that guy*. 

One evening, I heard people talking in front of my door, and eventually someone knocked adamantly, which happened a lot. I had to get up early next day and was a little pissed, so I opened the door and wanted to ask whoever it was to go away. It was a slightly drunk student I had never seen before and she asked me if she could come in. Apparently, she had been talking to some guy that creeped her out a bit and wouldn't let her be. As the guy was taking a piss, she decided the best way to leave would be to hide at my place. I was like ""sure"", and as she came in, the dude showed up again and came straight up to me, asking me if I had just ""taken his girl"" or something in that vein. 

Now, I'm not a threatening guy in any sense of the word. In fact, I pretty much look like a guy that would rather stay in bed while there is a pub party going on next door. I was still sleepy, and stood there in my less than imposing sleeping pants, and I just wanted to get back to bed, so I just said ""yes"". The dude looked at me angrily, and then he just left. 

And that was the end of it. The girl hung out at my place for some time, we went out and found the friend she was there with, and I was able to get some well-needed sleep after all. "
818,"Just play apex, now. It's socially acceptable. "
819,Not as shiny.
820,Jill but yeah she was a Karen
821,"I have accounts on most shit. Pretty much never post, though. My life is too mundane, and I frequently never understood why people post everything "
822,"It will though, age in this case means upwards of forty"
823,Sitting on the toilet...? I like to do it alone and I wouldn't feel comfortable with having people staring me.
824,"The fox and the hound. Nothing comes close to it for me.
"
825,Traveling on a whim. Clears your head. Especially this time of year when it's cold and you want to be on a beach somewhere having waiters at your beck and call.  
826,"Height 6""2,  one that surprises me is how many people are jealous of my ginger hair"
827,"It's becoming more common especially if they're on dating apps. My GF was dating another guy when she met me, but ended it after I brought the subject up on our 5th date."
828,"I have an account on a lot of sites. I really only post to twitter though. I hate facebook, but use it for work. I have an IG, but really only talk to friends and share stories of my kids. The rest I use even less frequently."
829,I'd love to keep having kids.  How do you afford 5?
830,Weezer sucks. 
831,"Thank you.  I’m from the US but lost as well.  I know what the pants look like, but is there a stereotype for the woman who wears those?"
832,My son dick's online
833,"That cracked me up, thank you"
834,"Yeah I completely fail to see how having a baby face is an advantage for guys.  Even the ""You'll appreciate it when you get older"" line doesn't make sense."
835,Lmao they're all over the place. Got this knockoff vampire's wife dress next to their $300 velour pants: http://s002.osstatic.net/s/jctr/store/productimages/master/210364_rosewater_tossed_floral_l.jpg
836,"I've made peace that my father's side always goes bald, therefore I have become bald before it falls out."
837,"Eventually she will have to swap out the ""Moist"" pants for ""Parched""."
838,Slicked back undercut. I get it buzzed every 2-3 weeks
839,A Bluetooth mouse. It's so much easier than having cables! 
840,I feel like its costing me more money in both the short and long term. 
841,Buy a puppy 
842,"I've posted this before, so I'll just copy and paste.  
&gt;I met this woman named Allie when I was in law school. We met at a party and she just had this amazing smile and incredible personality. We talked for a bit and exchanged numbers. Texted a bit over the next couple of weeks and set up a lunch date. We got thai food from a cart and walked around downtown on an incredibly beautiful day. Summer's in the pacific northwest are unreal. Anyway, we texted a little bit after that, but she was going out of the country and then I got busy with work/school and next thing you know it's been a month or so and neither of us have reached out and a girl I was sort of casually seeing says, ""hey I'm pregnant.""

&gt;A year later my girlfriend, our daughter, and my girlfriend's parents, bumped in to Allie and her date at a different thai restaurant. I stumbled out a hello it's good to see you and we went about our lives. She looked great. Same beautiful smile.

&gt;Well, my then-girlfriend-now-wife and I have been married for 9 years now. We have two kids and an amazing life. I don't LONG for Allie or wish we had wound up together, but I do sort of wish we had gotten to at least find out what would've happened.

I also have this woman from high school. For years we always managed to find each other when one of us is single and the other is in a relationship. Finally we both got married and still see each other. We both have kids. The sexual tension is still there, but it's manageable and kind of fun. "
843,"If the cop isn't having a bad day, you can get away with getting a ticket by just being honest and respectful. "
844,That sucks....is it true that adrenaline/stress chemicals taint the meat?
845,"AirPods. I'm on the phone a lot for work and they're invaluable. The audio quality for people on the other end is just so much better than the other wireless headphones I've used. 

"
846,I think they just would be like always lacking 
847,"Anythng is fine. And i get them all.

i'm not kidding. "
848,Made me cry. Beautiful. Words aren’t always necessary.
849,I actually had this conversation with my 86yo mom. She thanked me for having the courage to tell her!
850,Our words should always reflect the class of the speaker not the subject.
851,"You date a girl, you date all her friends. It's been that way for decades."
852,"Levi Boxer Briefs. The have different patters, and don't get all twisted around or give me wedgies."
853,"Worked out great. We hooked up for a month, it ended and shortly after my newfound confidence got me a second chance with the girl I'm dating now (who had previously rejected me)"
854,"You two seem really great together :)
Wish you the best for all the coming years "
855,"I get it cut every 2-3 months nowadays. I hate letting my hair get too long because it just becomes a wavy puffy mess and not even my pomade can really deal with it at that point. 

I get a 3 along the sides, and trim the top down to an inch and a half. I generally style it combed over to my left, then I'll flip the front of my hair back, fairly simple.
