0,"My girlfriend at the time mustered up the courage to say that she loved me for the first time ever. After an awkward pause I said ""Thank you I appreciate your honesty"" but didnt say I love you back. I was emotionally dense back then and she didnt talk to me for about a week after that. 

We're married now and every so often when I say I love you to her she thanks me for my honesty "
1,"When my dad met her and said to me, ""She looks... smart."""
2,"I am not a man but this happened to a male friend of mine:

They had been dating for 4 years, lived together for 2, had talked about their future lives together and how they wanted to get married one day and have kids. They’d both settled into great jobs and their lives seemed perfectly on track so he figured now was the time, right? He spoke to me about how he was going to do it, she didn’t want a public proposal or a big romantic gesture.

He proposed on a Saturday morning, after making her breakfast in bed “just because I love you”, with a beautiful ring. She burst into tears.

I remember him saying that he thought they were happy tears and she was just struggling to get the “Yes” out but she just kept crying until he had to put the ring down, get up and hold her to find out what was going on.

She’d been cheating on him for a year. Swore she’d broken it off, was going to pretend it never happened and live happily ever after but seeing his “hopeful face” at that moment just “broke” her and she couldn’t do it.

He left her. She was pretty depressed for a while, lost a lot of her friend group (most of us were friends with him first and she just kinda joined in so she wasn’t invited anywhere anymore and I had no interest in seeing her again). It was 3 years ago and I think she’s engaged to someone else now. Not sure if it’s the guy she was cheating with. My friend’s doing alright though, got a steady girlfriend but he’s a lot more reserved about it all now."
3,"In college, my dad paid me $1,000 to never ride a motorcycle. I bought one with the $1,000 he gave me, crashed it, broke my leg, and have maintained with him for almost a decade that I was just riding a longboard down a steep hill. "
4,Just wanted to say fuck you to all of you cheaters out there. 
5,"First day of college - I meet my new roommate. He hangs a Fight Club poster up and asks me if I like Fight Club. I said yes, of course. We had several conversations over the next couple years (we only lived together for one) about Fight Club and numerous references were made to it. Thing is, I've never seen Fight Club.

Eventually it was just a curiosity thing, how long could I go? I've still never seen it even though I know the plot pretty dang well from multiple hour-long conversations about it."
6,"My first wife originally said yes but a week before the wedding she broke down crying and said she didn't want to marry me. I consoled her and eventually convinced her that it was just pre-wedding jitters and stress talking. Within a couple years our marriage fell apart, she was cheating with multiple guys and I rarely saw her. She got a super high paying job and would just disappear on vacations or come home with a brand new BMW out of the blue. 

We've been divorced 10 years now and I'm happily remarried with two gorgeous children. I look back on my first marriage and see it as a placeholder for the life I was supposed to be living. Without my first wife I never would have met and fell in love with the second so it all worked out. "
7,My older brother told me she had the body of a goddess and the face to protect it.
8,"When I'm in a relationship, there is this constant background hum of feeling desired, appreciated and loved. No matter how content I am as a single person, there is the 15 or 20 percent of happiness I can only get from being physically intimate and affectionate with someone who truly wants me. There really is no substitution for that."
9,"My friend proposed to his gf at Red Lobster in front of his whole family.  She felt pressured of course and said yes.  Broke up with him shortly before the wedding.  

Pro Life Tip: 
Don't invite your family to the proposal."
10,Went to break up with gf. Had to go back because my keys fell in the sofa. She thought I was coming back for HER and leapt to me as if it was  a huge romantic “oh gawd I can’t live without her and I only made it to the truck before I realized this” moment. Had to pry her off me and move her aside before I could grab my keys. 
11,"Every girl I have ever dated was considered unattractive by someone. And every girl I have ever dated was considered extremely attractive by myself and several others.

As the saying goes, you can be the sweetest peach on earth, but some people just don't like peaches.

It sounds cliche, but you really can't go into the headspace of obsessing over what is attractive to people not in the relationship. It's best to assume that you and anyone you date won't be universally appealing. Focus on whether you are attracted to your SO and being attractive to your SO.

And it's worth remembering that every person has traditionally gorgeous days and ugly days. No one is perfect 100% of the time. Unless my wife is reading this. In which case, you are always gorgeous."
12,"Like three times back in High School I rejected girls that I was into to because I thought they were making fun of me. Looking back, none of them were the kinds of girls who would've done that, but I was kind of mean about it because I had anxiety/self-image problems and thought they were messing with me. So I feel pretty damn bad about that. "
13,"My father got two women pregnant, proposed to them both, was rejected both times. 

The first one, the mother of my half sister, rejected his proposal and broke up with him shortly afterwards. She asked him to sign over full custody, which he did. Though I knew of her, I did not formally meet my sister until my dad’s funeral. 

The second woman was my mom, several years later. He’d been planning on proposing within the next few months, so when he found out she was pregnant he asked her to marry him right away instead. 

She said absolutely not. There was no way she was getting married just because he’d knocked her up- he had to win her over first. 

He did! They got married seven months later and my mom was so pregnant she fainted at the (extremely long, extremely Catholic) wedding and had to be seated for her vows. It’s a favorite home video of all her cousins. 

They were happily married for almost thirteen years, until he died very suddenly in an airplane accident. She hasn’t remarried and isn’t interested in dating. 

Edit: this is getting weirdly popular?? I thought I should clear up some misconceptions 

1 my mom and my siblings and I knew about my half sister. We had her school pictures on the cupboard next to ours. My father was extremely honest about this- he started dating my mom years after he had broken up with his first girlfriend. 

2 I do not know the details about why his first girlfriend asked for sole custody but as far as I could tell the relationship between them was not especially contentious- from my understanding they were both very young at the time and from very catholic families. He wrote and spoke to my sister frequently as she grew up. 

3 the plane was not a commercial passenger plane. My father had a passion for flight and worked at an airplane factory specializing in gliders and 1-2 person planes. A friend/coworker offered him a ride. The plane apparently crashed due to pilot error and I do not know many details, only that it was a quick death, and that he was doing what he loved. I honestly feel worse for the pilot’s family- his wife was pregnant and was planning on telling her husband that weekend. 

4 I am not a guy! I probably should have mentioned this since the forum is askmen but I thought my story was pretty relevant to the topic. 
"
14,"Yep.  New Years Eve last year me and my friends went to Nashville.  We were sitting at a table in a bar.  This girl walked up to the bar and she was the prettiest girl I've ever seen.  I normally don't approach women, but I would have beaten myself up if I didn't try.  I'm not the smoothest guy.  I'm a big ball of anxiety and introverted.  I walked up to her and said ""INCOMPREHENSIBLESOUND*""

 "" HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT BRAIN?!? FUCK YOU BRO"" I thought.  She just looked at me and said ""What?"" I said ""INCOHERENTMUMBLE*""  I almost just walked back to the table.  I couldn't help but grin and cringe a bit, because I was fucking it up this badly.  Then I finally said something coherent.  ""Uhhh, my bad about that I uhhh don't really do this much, but clearly I'm at a loss.  I was wondering if I could buy you a drink and get to know you a little bit?""   She said ""I'm actually here with my friends and I should get back to them.""  
 
I went back to the table and told my friends what happened.  I proceeded to get roasted the rest of the trip.  But damn my noggin broke on that one."
15,"My wife passed away a year ago. The thing I miss most is not having a confidant who knows my history. So many times, something happens that I want to tell her, but she's no longer here so I can't. It's often something that I really can't talk to anyone else about. That makes me feel lonely more than anything else."
16,"Six or seven years ago I was delivering sandwiches and I take a delivery to this lawyers office. I'm looking down at the ticket to find the name as I walk up to the counter, I start saying ""I'm looking for *X* "" but I looked up and saw one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life. Early 20's, long red hair, beautiful bright green eyes. I just kinda of trailed off mid sentence mumbled wow and stared at her. After a couple of seconds she was like ""hello..."" and I finally kind of cleared my head, apologized, gave her her order and ran out of there as fast as I could embarrassed as shit."
17,"I've posted this before, but...

I was in a poetry class with my girlfriends best friend, sat next to her, we worked together, passed notes, just generally got along. One day we get an easy assignment, we just have to write a sonnet by the end of class.

I finish mine quickly and turn it in. She's writing like mad, erasing, rewriting, the full period. Five minutes to the bell she asks me to look it over and it's a long, drawn out poem filled with descriptions and imagery basically about her and me, how I'm always there for her, how she wishes I were hers, how I deserve better than my girlfriend, how she'd do anything to satisfy me.. Rhyming with things near to my name and hinting at my name throughout. It ended in an incomplete rhyming couplet that only my name could fit.

I read it over, she's watching me, fidgeting, tears in her eyes, and I hand it back to her, and say, deadpan:

""It's not a sonnet.""

The bell rings and I walk away as she collapses into sobbing, she changed classes that afternoon."
18,"I wish I were in a good relationship all the time, but am very cautious, bad relationships are way worse than just being lonely.  In flying we used to always say, it's better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the air wishing you were on the ground."
19,"When one of my best friends said “yeah, but you have a bad taste in women anyways“ while standing right in front of my current girlfriend.
Sucks.

Edit: 
Since this is my most upvoted comment ever, I'd like to add some things.

Yes, I am still friends with him. Guys, keep in mind that this was one single moment ripped out of context. IMO a true friendship should be able to take something like that. Granted, it was *the* most idiotic time and place to say something like that, but sometimes your brain (and social awareness) just has a blackout - hell, blurting out inappropriate things happens to me all the time. So yeah, bad idea, but I think in order to properly judge the situation you guys would've needed to be there.

Which leads me to the next point: 
Dear internet mob, please put away your pitchforks and torches, there will be no lynching today!
I have not and will not beat him up or punch him for saying what he thinks, however inappropriate the timing was. If he doesn't find her attractive, so what? All the better for me. I rarely find his girlfriends or fuckbuddys attractive either, and I certainly let him know that. If you feel like you need to resort to violence because of something like that, feel free to do it, but I like to talk to my friends BEFORE beating them up.

So in short: shoo, lynchmob. Back to your hidey holes, there is nothing to see here."
20,"When my dad proposed to my mom, she said no. The way I remember the story, she told him he needed to sober up, and then drove away and left him sitting on a curb.

Then he got sober and re-proposed a year later. Dad's now been sober for 34 years, and they've been married for 33. Sometimes things work out."
21,"I asked her to marry me.  

&amp;#x200B;

She said No -- that she didn't want to support the institution of marriage.  

&amp;#x200B;

I said that I didn't either, but I need health insurance.  

&amp;#x200B;

She said fine.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sixteen years together and three kids now."
22,"When I showed my buddy a picture of her and he sighed heavily and said ""Yeah..."""
23,Right after the wedding when they said thanks for taking that one off the market.
24,The only soap you have is a 7 in one shampoo/conditioner/body wash/dish soap/hand soap/laundry detergent/car wax 
25,Goddamn
26,"Girls would always act weird when I’d ask them over for dinner and tell them to bring their fork, unless they wanted to share."
27,No he said it was an airplane.
28,"A couple of my friends were telling me about how another friend called my ex unattractive behind my back, but then reassured me that she was ""average-looking"""
29,[removed]
30,this is my favourite one. just because she sometimes thanks you for your honesty even now 
31,I use a tshirt as a pillow case from time to time.
32,"When I was a teen, a girl 2 years my junior, gave me a gold necklace. I had never spoken to her prior to this and I was extremely weirded out. Regrettably, I gave her a really weird confused/wtf face, and it destroyed her. She ran away crying. I still feel bad about it, and I never knew her name. I saw her a couple of times and she would always duck her head in shame and run away. I never had the opportunity to apologise or give the necklace back."
33,"I had a very serious crush on a girl I had some classes with and we had become friends, but she didn't know.

She excitedly pointed out that she is wearing this new shirt. She takes a step back and pulls her shirt down. Time slows to a crawl - I register that there is a comic character and some text *all over her boobs*. Cue complete brain meltdown, like a train hitting a wall and I stare. She gleefully asks how I find it and I manage to control myself for a second and mumble that I didn't get the whole text (THREE FUCKING WORDS), so she pulls her shirt down again. Tight. I force myself to repeat in my head ""Read the text! Read the text!"" on a loop.

I managed to get the words, but no meaning and just said that it is a really great shirt. I must have looked like a stroke victim... We had a great laugh about that one a few years later :)"
34,That is horrifying
35,This was a fucking rollercoaster
36,"I enjoy hiking on the weekends and you tend to see a lot of fit, attractive people on the mountains. Well last weekend I was about halfway up and I saw two girls coming down the trail. First girl was cute and she said good morning to me which is when I caught sight of her friend behind her. 

Most beautiful blonde girl I've ever seen is walking toward me and I stumble over saying good morning while tripping uphill..."
37,"      Do you like me?


        YES      NO



        Circle one. "
38,You are single and you rent an apartment 
39,"Buddy, I got to get moving. Your mom is only going to ovulate a few more times.

Edit: Don’t Upvote. Give me Gold."
40,"My grandfather proposed to my grandmother the night he met her at a military ball since he was suppose to leave for deployment the next week (World War II Navy Officer). My grandmother said no, but to ask when he got back. He came back, tracked her down, and asked again. She said yes. They were married for over 60 years before he passed away. "
41,"I remember going to the gas station by my house with a friend to pickup some beer near the cutoff hour and when the girl at the counter asked me how old I was I looked up at her and literally forgot where I was, who I was, why I was there as well as how old I was and that my friend was even with me. ""How old are you"" she asked and I just blurted out ""18"" having not been asked how old I was in years. My friend behind me just blurts our ""are you retarded? he's 24 and apparently just had a stroke"" I handed her my ID and she just smiles and says ""18 huh? so this is fake?"" and the older woman who'd been working there since I was literally in middle school just waved to her and said verbatim ""He's alright honey I've known him since he was a baby. He's a little slow sometimes"" to which my friend replied ""sometimes, yeah ok."" "
42,"“It’s not a sonnet”

My sides are in orbit"
43,"When I showed my family a picture and after starting for about 30 seconds, one of my cousins says ""she suits you"". 

Then everyone laughed... 

Edit: typo"
44,"Well done, seriously.

If you hadnt tried, it would be a 100% no chance"
45,"As long as she already has a support network, or friends or family that know about her issues, chances are she’s going to hear a lot of the same comments.

“You can do this.”

“We’re here for you.”

“Let us know if you ever need anything.”

What she might not get to hear as often, is something that I know means a lot to me when people tell me (still suffering with MH), and always brought a smile to the faces of those that I was there for.

“I’m proud of you.”

Remind her you know how hard things can be, and how mentally and physically draining it can be on a person to do the slightest, most simple things - so the sheer fact that they’re still here, still soldiering on, and still trying every single day despite the difficulties they’re facing, is something you can tell them you’re proud of. Don’t try and bolster their strength; or try to convince them they can find it again - remind them they’re already strong, and that each day they get through is a successful battle, and that you’re proud of them for that."
46,"When someone told me ""he has a face only a mother could love"""
47,"When I was in high school, like the 10th grade a girl I knew... decently well, asked me for my iPod touch. She had one of our friends give it back to me 10 minutes later with a note on there about how she had a dream about having a future with me with a bunch of kids a house and puppies.

Oddly enough, I wasn't weirded out, it was kind of sweet and she was pretty cute but I was mildly slow at that time and had no idea how to handle it so and no real interest in dating at the time I think I thanked her gave her a hug and subsequently forgot about it. If that were me that probably would have crushed *me*. We still interacted afterwards, sort of like it didn't happen, I never brought it up and she never did either. I only remembered this happened like a few years ago and I can't believe I was so fucking stupid about it. Looking back now I totally should have dated her. I'd love some puppies right now."
48,"Back in 2014 a drinking buddy rang me up to go for a drink, we went to a bar and chatted but he was kinda down the whole night, I asked what was up. He skirted around it but eventually told me, he and his gf broke up. They’d been together 5 years and were living together.

I’d had a few drinks and, not being close enough mates for a heart to heart I thought the best course would be to make him laugh by saying/singing “Well if you liked it bro, you shoulda put a ring on it” and rubbed my butt against his thigh going “woah oh oh uh oh oh ohhh”

Turns out, he’d bought a ring. 

He got down on one knee and proposed, she said no. 

He began crying at that point so I stopped grinding and bought him a drink, but it was a bit awkward.

She basically didn’t see him as a long term prospect. I will add that this was in Korea, she was Korean and he American. I think she realised he was staying for her, and tho he loved living in Korea I think there’s a pressure to that knowledge that either you deal with or you buckle under.

He quit his job and moved back to his hometown a week later and Facebook tells me he’s a relationship now."

&gt;Researchers said it was as if he was so keen to make an impression he 'temporarily absorbed most of his cognitive resources.'

This podcast had one of the most vivid descriptions I've come across of this:

[This American Life 220: Testosterone](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220/testosterone)

I highly recommend listening to ""Act 2: Infinite Gent.""  It's about a person who received massive doses of testosterone. 

Made me look at being male in a new way.

Excerpt:

&gt; Griffin Hansbury: My first injection was a pretty large one of 2 ccs of 200 milligram strength depo-testosterone, which is a fairly high amount. 

&gt;Just to give you a sense of how much that is, the average amount of testosterone in an average male body is between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter of blood. 

&gt;After that shot, and after an average shot, my testosterone levels go up to over 2,000 nanograms per deciliter, so that I have the testosterone of two high-testosterone men in my body at once.
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: You have the testosterone of two linebackers.
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. Exactly. That's a lot. That's a lot of T. And what's amazing about it is how instantaneous it is, that it happens within a few days really. The world just changes.
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: What were some of the changes that you didn't expect?
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; The most overwhelming feeling is the incredible increase in libido and change in the way that I perceived women and the way I thought about sex. 

&gt;Before testosterone, I would be riding the subway, which is the traditional hotbed of lust in the city. 

&gt;And I would see a woman on the subway, and I would think, *she's attractive. I'd like to meet her. What's that book she's reading? I could talk to her.* This is what I would say.
&gt; 
&gt; There would be a narrative. There would be this stream of language. It would be very verbal.
&gt; 
&gt; After testosterone, there was no narrative. There was no language whatsoever. It was just, I would see a woman who was attractive or not attractive. She might have an attractive quality, nice ankles or something, and the rest of her would be fairly unappealing to me.
&gt; 
&gt; But that was enough to basically just flood my mind with aggressive, pornographic images, just one after another. It was like being in a pornographic movie house in my mind. And I couldn't turn it off. I could not turn it off. Everything I looked at, everything I touched, turned to sex.
&gt; 
&gt; . . . 
&gt; 
&gt; Alex Blumberg: What did you do with that? I mean, what did you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Griffin Hansbury:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I felt like a monster a lot of the time. And it made me understand men. It made me understand adolescent boys a lot. Suddenly, hair is sprouting, and I'm turning into this beast. And I would really berate myself for it.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember walking up Fifth Avenue, there was a woman walking in front of me. And she was wearing this little skirt and this little top. 

&gt;And I was looking at her ass. And I kept saying to myself, *don't look at it, don't look at it.* And I kept looking at it.
&gt; 
&gt; And I walked past her. And this voice in my head kept saying, *turn around to look at her breasts. Turn around, turn around, turn around.* 

&gt;And my feminist, female background kept saying, *don't you dare, you pig. Don't turn around.* And I fought myself for a whole block, and then I turned around and checked her out."
50,"I dated a guy in college who I knew wasn't conventionally attractive, but I figured that I wasn't attractive either, so what's the big deal?

People weren't shy about letting me know they didn't approve: ""I think it's great that you see people for their heart""

In the department where I was a university student, the whole office would gossip about waiting for us to break up so they could set me up with another student they deemed more ""worthy"". (This would be super mean if it was just about appearances, but my ex also wasn't a very nice person. Still mean, but not based solely on looks.)

The moment it actually hit me was when I visited him in his dorm for the first time and all of the students around were laughing and saying ""X's hot girlfriend is real"" ""Did you bribe her to come here?"""
51,"A friend once “jokingly” said he’d buy me a laptop if I slept with him. I *jokingly* agreed and said “Haha, yeah sure.” because who tf buys someone a £600 laptop so they can sleep with them?

Next time I saw him, he’d bought the laptop. I stared at it awkwardly. He told me he didn’t actually expect sex but wanted me to have it anyway.

I didn’t take the laptop. Or continue the friendship."
52,"If you aren’t sexually active with each other yet, it would be good to know her plans in that area.  If she’s waiting for marriage you best know that now.

In general in regards to future plans - remember that’s not a contract, that’s a good general bit of background about what she’d like in the future.  People change - especially if you are young. 

Also - you might be overthinking this.  You aren’t committing to a lifetime together.  Presumably you are talking about committing to seeing each other exclusively, so you don’t need to be on the same page with everything future-wise.

The biggest question you should ask yourself is:  Do I like this person enough to stop seeing other people, do I want to get to know her better, and do I trust her enough to open up and let her know me better.  You can learn all that other future stuff on the way - this isn’t a job interview for her :)"
53,"This is my dating life in a nutshell

Single Me: Damn I've been single awhile I really need to find a girl 

Relationship Me: What in the world have I done"
54,"I asked her to marry me and she said it was the happiest day of her life, but she never said yes. And I thought it was funny in the weeks that followed and brought it up thinking she was just so excited she forgot but she never said yes until I flat out asked and she told me she never wanted to get married. She wanted to be with me for the rest of our lives but not get married.

She's from a middle eastern Muslim culture and a strict (&amp; abusive) family that still valued women as property to be arranged into marriages for the family's benefit. So marriage has always been a punishment in her mind.

We stayed together 5 years before all of that family abuse and distance broke us apart. She's arranged to be married this December 

edit: dear islamophobic fucks, fuck off. 

everyone else, thanks for the sympathy, understanding, insight, and stories of your own."
55,"Not me, but my father. My father proposed after roughly 7 months of getting to know my mother. She said no. She told him later that night that she loves him but she needs to get to know him a little better and vice versa. 2 years later he asked again and she said yes. When I asked my mom, she said that 7 months was just a little too quick for her. She said something to the effect of ""when you've been dating for that long you only see the really good aspects of the person. They arent 100 percent themself yet"". They have been married for 22 years now and are still happy."
56,"my friends referred to him as chewbacca or wookie.  got a lot of comments like, ""well nobody can say you're shallow""."
57,"Yeah, that’s the thing with public proposals like that... when they work, they’re sometimes admirable, but otherwise they’re just uncomfortable for everyone. You didn’t do anything wrong."
58,"If you fuck the cheaters, you are only contributing to the problem!  DON'T FUCK CHEATERS!  Then they can't cheat."
59,Was it a gizzard???
60,"My first real girlfriend when I was about 14.
They made fun of her when I brought her to lake where all the kids were going back than. Just because she had a small unusual piece of skin on her neck (don’t know how its called)

Obviously they were no real friends and I distanced myself from them. She still broke up with me because it hurt her so much "
61,"About a year-and-a-half ago, Google came up with this idea to allow you to make photo books out of your Google photos account. My girlfriend and I had been dating for almost 2 years and I knew she was the one I wanted to marry, so I created this wonderful photo book of all of our selfies together and ended it with a page made out of a photo I generated that said will you marry me. I then proceeded to put all these things into an album and build the photo book.

What didn't occur to me at the time was that the album I put these in was a shared album and the other person gets a notification when you add new photos to it. And the other person that the album was shared with? My girlfriend.

That evening, we had dinner and it all came out. She saw the photo, she wasn't ready, there were a few reasons why but they were good reasons and smart reasons mostly to do with timing, family, and finances. We weren't breaking up, we just weren't getting engaged at that time. A year later, we have fully discussed the concept of getting married, we went ring shopping, she picked her own ring, and by the time I actually did propose we both knew what her answer would be.

We're now getting married in April. I would say it all worked out in the end. And I still have that photo book sitting on a shelf in our living room.

Edit because I think y'all will find it funny. When I actually did get around to proposing, it was on this big birthday trip this summer. Our flight was delayed, so by the time we got to the hotel it was like 11:30pm and we were dead tired. She was like ""I'm going to hop a shower"" and I was like ""come out here first."" I told her I didn't want to wait another second for her to not be my fiancee and I proposed right there in the hotel room.

She was so tired and zonked out that her response was "".....okay."" (After a good night's sleep she was beyond thrilled, but at the moment, it was kinda hilarious.)

We're thinking about making that part of the wedding ceremony. ""Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedding husband?"" ""......okay."""
62,This is the cutest thread. I’ve never experienced this as a woman. I’m amazed it’s that common for men. It seems like something from a cartoon (complete with wooogah noises and eyeballs popping)
63,Did you get to keep the BMW?
64,You know she is going to hit you back with the vibrator was better than you ever were.
65,"She wanted 'more commitment' and to 'feel like part of my life', so I discussed marriage with her. Not some kind of grand proposal - more like, ""well, are you ready for this? Is this what we are doing?"". She said she wasn't interested in marriage. 

When I began shopping for my first home she wanted me to take a loan from her father so that she could own part of the house. I proposed marriage again, she said no. It ended for a bunch of other reasons shortly thereafter. 

In my (and according to what she told me, her) opinion marriage exists for a reason: financial and legal protection. She apparently wanted to join finances but not get married, which was just a symptom of all the other things wrong in that relationship."
66,"As far as depression, I think a big part of it is making sure they understand that you love them just the way they are, depression and all. Even though your goal might be to help them get better, they have to feel safe and accepted before you can really help.

Once they are in a place where they know they can count on you, then you can start working on the bigger issues. 

This is also pretty much the story of how we ended up getting a cat."

71,"Had a huge crush on this girl in college, couldn’t ever get a word out to her. One night I’m riding my skateboard and she’s walking towards me, I look at her and accidentally put my foot in front of my skateboard instead of the side (to pump). I flip over, cut my arms up, smash my head, then pick up the board and haul ass away. 10 minutes later I’m puking everywhere and can’t even walk straight. Go to the hospital and tell the doctors and they are all cracking up as I’m puking and the room is spinning. Then she transferred schools. "
72,"Not sure anything beats the kid that finds a dildo and thinks it's a light saber and runs around the house playing ""Yoda"" with it during Thanksgiving. Hilarious in my situation but felt so bad for my cousin."

76,"I met her 15 years ago.  Fell in love immediately.  She wasn't interested in being anything more than friends.

I told her we could be friends, as long as she was aware that I was crazy about her.  We became best friends, I watched her get into 4 serious relationships in that time.  We did everything together, took trips together.  I've seen her at least once a week for the last 8 years.  Every single time I saw her, I forgot how to speak.  She causes traffic accedents walking down the street, men approach her while we're out to dinner together and ask if we're together, to see if they can get her number.


2 weeks ago we were on a weekend trip together, after we had unpacked she gently put my face in her hands and said over and over again.

""I am completely in love with you""

Best day of my life.

Now I'm terrified. 

"
77,"Was friends with a girl for about a year. We hung out with a group of friends outside of school. Youth group, floating the river, sledding, hiking all kinds of stuff. She was dating one of my close friends. They broke up and a few months later she passed me a note in class, saying she liked me and would like to go to the dance with me. I knew my friend would be pissed if I dated her and I would lose him as a friend. About a week later I got called into the principles office along with a few of my friends. She had died of an aneurism. I always and still do feel guilty for saying no and not spending that short time with her. In a way I'm glad I didnt because it would have hurt so much more and I feel even more guilty about that. "

83,"6th grade I was joking around with this girl in my science class. It was a lab about electricity and we had to connect wires to turn on a lightbulb.

As we were leaving to our typing class I made some sort of joke, forgot what it was. She laughed, grabbed my arm, looked me in the eyes and said ""You're so funny, I really like you /u/fateofmorality"".

I paused, said great, and ran off. I avoided talking to her for a few months because I thought she was making fun of me or trying to trick me so her friends could laugh at me.

This was in a school of 120 people so I saw her every day but I avoided her. I feel like a bastard because of it. "
84,"I’d show a picture of her to friends and colleagues and they’d always say, “oh she’s soooo...”

I’d cheerfully try to help by contributing, “Beautiful? Successful? Confident?”

“...fat.”"
85,"If you go fast enough, all lights in front are blue."
86,This is an honest response. 
87,Kind of miss it. I miss being able to share my day with someone. The sex/cuddling is always fun but being able to create new memories with someone is what I miss the most.

95,"One time my buddy and I were working at this burger restaurant back In college, and the hottest girl I have probably ever seen walks in. She’s proportioned like a perfectly sculpted marble bust reminicesnt of Venus de Milo and has a face that looked so innocent and natural. I swear she freakin looked like she was glowing sitting up against those nasty burger restaurant windows. 

Anyway

I lean over to my buddy to let him know that the hottest girl ever had just walked in, and he turns around. He was holding a giant-ass, industrial mustard tub and just drops it. Just literally drops it for no reason at all and starts mumbling quietly. 

Every time after that when he would see a very pretty girl, my buddies and I would always assure him that the girl probably had way too much mustard for his hotdog. 

Edit: no reason"
96,"I had been in a relationship with my gf for just over 7 years when I proposed.  We had been through a fairly rough patch where things were touch and go.  We argued a lot and there were other issues that we allowed to continue unresolved and/or unaddressed.  Most of it was not communicating effectively to one another.

Another source of friction was that I was in a touring band and a lot of my time outside of my day job was dedicated to my band.  I was working FT and then also playing 2-3 shows a week minimum (usually our of town).  Vacations were used to go out on tour....  At the same time she was working a job that she didn't enjoy that forced her to work long hourse (8am-8pm daily).  My band reached it's breaking point, we decided to call it...  I was rocked a little but I was also overcome with a sense of relief.  I could now dedicate so much more time to my relationship and start doing things that I was previously unable to do (travelling was a big passion of ours but prior to the band split all of my vacation time was dedicated to tours)...   I thought then was a great opportunity to ask her to marry me.  In retrospect I can now see that it seemed desperate and forced as a result of the band break up, or maybe she thought that I was searching for something to stabilize my life.  The truth is that I was truly relieved and excited that I could really dedicate time to my SO.  Well....  She said no!  The sentiment of my proposal was terrible and the timing was stupid.  I just thought I would jump right in and ignore that we'd been in choppy waters in our relationship for 2 years (or more).  There was a silver lining though, I knew she loved me, I understood her concerns.  I dedicated myself to improving our relationship anyways (as did she).  We went to couples counseling (at her behest) and learned to communicate effectively to each other.  I learned the difference between the intent of my statements and how they can be perceived.  We traveled and learned that we are amazing travel partners.  We are both adventurous and really enjoy immersing ourselves in the culture and food wherever we go.  About 2.5 years later I came home on Valentine's Day (which we never celebrate at all) to an apartment full of candles and flowers, a charcuterie board and champagne...  She asked me if I would marry her....  I said yes...  3 years married now and our 11th year together!  Yay us!!!!"
97,Holy shit people are assholes.
98,"In college I got a phone call asking me to a sorority ""dash-a-date"" later that evening. I had no idea who she was, so I politely declined saying I had an exam tomorrow.

The next day I ran into this adorable girl I had been flirting with for weeks, but never had the guts to ask out because always thought she was way out of my league. She asked me how I did on my test. Only one person thought I actually had a test. Apparently I didn't have much of a poker face because before I could answer she asked me if I was ok. I was so panicked I made up some lame excuse about forgetting to do something and ran.

We're married and have three kids."
99,When I was a junior I was asked out by a special needs girl. She said something along the lines of can we go out sometime ? I figured she ment hang out after school sometime so yeah for sure . I was dumb at that age and didn't realize what she asked . I realized like an hour later in school and has to reverse my answer . I've never felt like such a piece of trash after doing that . She was the only girl to ever ask ME out though . 
100,"GF: I would like to go and buy a couch with you.

102,"Went out with this girl, who seemed infatuated with me, which made me slightly uncomfortable since I'm not good looking enough to merit that... anyways, after our second meet up, she offers to walk me back to my place. She has to stop somewhere to use a bathroom, but once she's done, I foolishly say ""I'm good to walk the rest of the way from here."" Hug and part our separate ways. She had to walk maybe a mile back to her car, and I'm so oblivious that I didn't even think about it.

That quote helped form my adult mindset "
106,"**EDIT:** *I appreciate the people trying to defend me to the ones saying that I went absolutely insane and that I was unstable and unhealthy and she dodged a bullet, but the people who are criticizing me are correct. My entire point was not to act the way that I did. I'm getting help, it's very slow and it's unsteady and it doesn't feel like it's helping, but I'm getting it and if you're in this kind of predicament you should too because you are not okay and don't let any of your well meeting friends tell you you are. The most disturbing comments I have seen are those defending my behavior. It's NOT OK to think you'll be the only one to love someone the way they need it, even after the breakup. It's NOT OK to do 99% of the stuff in the following post. She DID dodge a bullet, I was a huge mess, and mostly still am. I'm working on it but for God's sake, people, stop defending the lowest point in my life. Learn from it.*

This is basically going to be a copy/paste of a previous comment I made, but if it can help someone I'd like it to be heard.

I had been dating a girl for 6 years, the last little bit of high school and through the entirety of college. I bought a ring. She gets a job and starts hanging out with this dude, at the time she's 23, he is 42. Yeah, way too old, not a big deal, she is into me and people her age. But still, I tell her that this dude is making me uncomfortable. I tell her, ""Honey, I know that you like hanging out with him and it's nice to have friends beyond out relationship, but I have a bad feeling about this one."" Unprompted, she promised me she wouldn't hang out with him alone. And she never did. Then I proposed and ~~we lived happily ever after~~ she told me that she actually has been hanging out with him at work and is really enjoying his company and she isn't sure if we should get married anymore. That's more than most men get so I tell her it's cool and leave. On the way home I break into tears and I lose my mind over the next few weeks trying to get her back. I'd love to say I let her go easy but it was my first relationship, first love, first breakup, and I was gonna marry her.

If a breakup happens, if you propose and she says no, don't snoop her social media, don't send her parents screenshots of dirty Facebook PMs you found listing the guy's age to sabotage the new relationship, don't tell her hurtful things because you're still hurt, don't try to change her mind until she says she hates your guts and never wants to see you again, don't sell the ring for 1/4 of what you paid, don't spend it all on a guitar and alcohol and cigarettes and pot in a non-legalized state, don't go far enough down that rabbit hole that you lose your job and house and have to go to rehab for a year. If it ends when you propose take a vacation from work for a week to just grieve instead of trying to work while upset and losing it and your job altogether. And five years later don't go look her up again to find out she married the wrong man because he'll never love her like you still will the rest of your life. Don't settle for less after that relationship and decide you'll never be worth more than the dregs at the bottom of the barrel. Don't let those thoughts sink in and try to decimate the minute progress you've made over the last year, don't avoid going to a doctor for your depression and bottling it up and letting it get to the point that you tell yourself you spent all your love on someone who left and you have no more to give, don't stop doing things that make you *you*. It'll cost you all of your friends, your personality will disintegrate, you'll move from thoughts that are a quiet, ""I wish I was dead"" to very loud ""Carbon Monoxide is an easy death. Do it in your car, somewhere no one will stumble upon such a bad scene. And the gas buildup might hurt someone else if they rush in to open the door when they find you so make sure you put warning stickers on the windows indicating the time you started and the CM buildup so they know not to put themselves in danger trying to save you if you're long gone. Don't forget the note, and if you buy CM make sure you exonerate the sellers so they're not criminally charged for selling it to you.""

I could go on forever. If you fall in love and you think she's/he's the one and if you propose and break up, *take a week off work*, and spend it grieving. Don't go on a vacation, stay at home a few of those days and just cry. Get it all out. Be sick. Throw up. Break things. Scream as loud as you can. After a two or three days clean yourself up, go be with friends. Same-sex friends or vice-versa if you're gay. People you don't wanna date. Drink a beer and talk about everything that made you happy before you met him/her. Remind yourself you can heal and move on. Don't do what I did, I'm still not happy and now I'm starting my entire life over at 27. No one likes a near-30's-burnout who has to move back in with his parents and works for minimum wage and everyone judges you if you've ever been to rehab, even over something as small as pot, regardless if you've never been arrested."
107,"It's happened to me (I am a woman) several times. 

The most memorable was when I got pulled over for speeding by, what must have been, the NJ State Trooper's most gorgeous officer.

111,Pro Life Tip: Talk to your SO about marriage before you propose. First step in a relationship is good communication...
112," I was hanging out with a friend, and she told me that she had a crush on me. I was flattered of course, because I did and do hold her in high regard. But, to be honest, I simply wasn't attracted to her, and because of the significant gap in our ages, I had never considered her as a potential partner. So it kind of came out of left field. I think that I let her down easily, but I still  Felt sort of bad. "
113,My sister told me our family nicknamed him Tweety bird. 
114,"Not a man, but my husband is, so. He was 19 and I was 22. He was a Marine who just got back from his first deployment and we had just had our closest friends get engaged the week before, he buys me a ring. He wasn’t secretive about it at all and try’s to get me to go out to a nice restaurant we both liked. I tell him “I don’t want to go” basically because I know he is going to try and propose. We get into a bit of an argument because I’m refusing to go to the place he wants to propose to me. He plops the ring down and says “well, here.”

I circuitously say I don’t think we should get married because we’re too young, we’ve only been dating for a year and a half, our friends just got married, he just got back from deployment and the excitement of it is probably getting to him. All good reasons why I think he is rushing into asking me. He proceeds to make a good argument for 3 hours. He convinced me. 

10 years of marriage later, as a general guideline, I still think we were too young, but I’m glad I listened."
115,"Yep. One of my best friends (and ex) used to do it to me all the time. Still does, occasionally. I don't know how but she'll just laugh or smile a certain way and it bluescreens my brain..."
116,"my mom told me once that my dad proposed by asking, ""So, do you think if I asked you to marry me you would?"" She dumped him on the spot for not being man enough to ask directly.

Guess they worked it out eventually, though."
117,Hugs are the fucking cure to life man
118,"Woman here; both my boyfriend and I have mental health issues.

On days where one of us is feeling worse than usual, the other will pick up the slack. For example, if he’s feeling bad and he normally takes out the trash/does the dishes, I’ll do those tasks instead, and vice versa. On days where we both feel shitty, we tend to accept that it’s okay not to get everything done that we normally would, instead doing things that make us happy, like binge watching shows or playing video games.

It also helps that we know the warning signs that the other person’s mental condition is worsening, and can usually tell the other before they even realize it. Similarly, we know how to calm the other person down if one of us has an emotional episode, often letting the other cry it out while cuddling.

It can be stressful, and it’s not for everyone, but it works for us. Just make sure that you aren’t making yourself/they aren’t making you solely responsible for their mental health, instead encouraging them to seek therapy/medication if necessary. "
119,"Not sure if you mean this seriously or not, but... it really really is. So many couples get a couch/ dog/ bed/ bank account together. And then feel more intertwined and committed than they would have if they didn't get these shared items. Having a legit couch can seem like a step towards adulthood or investment in the relationship, and just kind of sleepwalk into staying when they otherwise would have parted ways. 

Before you know it, you're engaged because ""it's time, and we've been together for 5 years"" and her sisters keep ""joking"" about a wedding, and even though she's not terrible, she's not what you truly, deeply want, but calling it off seems cruel because there's nothing tangibly wrong like cheating or abuse, and everyone gets cold feet, right? So, you put a deposit on a venue down. Send out invites. All the while, a tiny little voice in your head is nagging at you, but it's easy enough to ignore because it's progressed so slowly. You try to ""compromise"" at every step of your life, but end up sacrificing your most attractive, productive years and will end up bitter and telling yourself and your friends ""I knew it was a mistake and we never should have even moved in together."" Luckily, you will have your couch to sleep on as you contemplate where it all went wrong and the regrets of merging your life with someone who you knew, deep down, wasn't a good match.

TL;DR - it started out with a couch, how did it end up like this? Source: coming up on 40 and watching these marriages that never should have started, unfold left and right, leaving bitterness and regret in their wake."
120,did she ever find that x?
121,"Tell your son it's your vibrator, but not to tell mommy. Separately tell her that ""hey, son and I had a talk today. I just want you to know, whatever he found, it's not really mine, even if he says it is."" Make it seem like you swore the son to secrecy. She will likely pry the boy to figure out what it was, and surely, some day the kid will tell her. Ah, go for the long con on this one."
122,"In college, I ordered a pizza. The driver called to say she was pulling in so I headed to the elevator. The elevator opens directly in front of, and about 5 feet from the glass door. She was standing in front of the door and smiled when she saw me. She was unbelievably gorgeous, especially for what I expected from a pizza hut delivery driver. 

I smiled back and went to push down the handle and push the door open. Naturally, my hand missed the handle and I walked face first into the glass door. I may have been overzealous, because apparently I was walking fast enough for that to give me a nose bleed. 

In most cases, I could have played it off with a silly line and laughed. Instead, what came out was, ""Fuckshit that hurt,"" and a couple other stupid noises. She was really nice though. She kinda laughed and said, ""At least you didn't fall."" Then she gave me a napkin for my nose bleed and left. If I hadn't just gotten a pizza, I might have taken the elevator to the roof and jumped."
123,"Man I hate coming across people on the trail. I mean I like talking to folks, but I'm always worried they'll be uncomfortable coming across a guy in the middle of nowhere and be afraid of me or something.

128,"I'm a white woman in a relationship with an asian guy and my attraction to him seems to baffle many.


In addition to us being interracial, he's my height (maybe slightly shorter) and has longer hair than I do (and mine's chest length...) so I see the gears turning in people's heads pretty much any time we're together since I guess a lot of his physical characteristics would be considered ""niche"" or ""unconventionally attractive"" at the least by many. People seem to handle just being shorter okay, or just being Asian okay, or just having long hair okay, but seem to find my attraction to all three things at once incomprehensible.


It irritates me no doubt, primarily the questions and comments I get to hear regarding his ethnicity, but he is stupidly attractive to me (we're both rock climbers and damn this man is fit...). I know how lucky I am."

134,"21 years ago I was in a bar in NW Louisiana with some of my friends from ark. Waiting for a girl I had met a couple of weeks earlier. I see this tall brunette wearing hip hugger jeans and a crop top walk in. Small waist, round hips, amazing abs, stunning face. She sees me staring at her and gives me this absolutely amazing smile. I swear my jaw dropped because she had to be the most beautiful woman Iv ever seen. She walks up to a table and gives some dude a hug and kiss on his cheek (was her cousin), well I was like she's taken, but I still couldn't take my eyes off her. About an hour passes and some cute petite blonde comes up to me and ask my name and said a friend of hers wanted to meet me. She pointed to a table with that brunette and cousin and two other girls. The only one looking was the brunette, but she wasn't the one that was interested. The blonde motioned for her to come over and she did. Was like "" oh well, ------- this is ------  I swear I couldn't think of anything to say, a song came on and I just grabbed her hand and said "" let's dance"". It was the best thing I could have done, she was a dance instructor and was a cheerleader for the CFL.  We've been married for almost 19 years and have 3 children. She's 44 years old and still just as beautiful as the day we met. We walk into restaurants and clubs and I see guys staring at her, and I'm like, been there dude. 

Forgot to mention the girl I was waiting on showed up about an hour later.  I told my wife about her before she showed up, but told her it would be a dick move, on my part, to ditch her, and that I would really love to see her again. She understood and wrote her number on a coaster and told me to call her. I ended up taking the other girl back to my place, but didn't even try anything with her. Ended up trying to call my wife the next morning before I took the other girl home lol. I was totally smitten. "
135,That is the most savage thing I've seen in this thread. I would die of embarrassment if I heard someone say this about me.
136,"I didn't. I just learned to accept that it's part of who I am. Some women are not attracted to me for that trait, and that's fine. Those aren't the women I want to talk to anyway. There are still plenty of women who don't care.

Edit: Also helps if you're in awesome shape."

138,"When I finally introduced him to my “friends” and a few of them said “really? You couldn’t find anyone... taller? Or better looking.?” It broke my heart. He’s my height. Perfect kissing level. And I think he’s the most beautiful guy on planet earth :( it didn’t break my heart that my friends didn’t approve. Fuck them. It broke my heart that without knowing him they can be so mean. He’s a sweetheart and has done everything for me. And extremely attractive to me.

141,"I had this happen. Got in a huge fight, stormed out the door, assuming I'd never have to see her again. I ended up forgetting my glasses in the house, so I had to go back in and get them. We somehow managed to convince ourselves that the relationship was worth saving.

We broke up for real two weeks later.

Oh also it was her birthday.

One of the bigger oofs of my life.

EDIT: OH EVEN BETTER. Her birthday is near Valentine's. I just realized how fucked up that night was.
"
142,"Similar with me and my current girlfriend.  I knew she was really into me, but I was being really cautious because I had been single for a few years after a really difficult breakup so taking things slow was important to me.  One night laying in bed she tells me she loves me as we're falling asleep, I just said ""I know.""  I had already been tempted to tell her I loved her and didn't even realize it was a Star Wars reference.  A couple years later we watched the Star Wars series as she had never seen them, and when that iconic line popped up she just looked at me like ""you son of a bitch, you pulled a movie line?!"".  We laugh about it now."
143,"Realtor Here.

IT MAY BE A BAD IDEA BUY A HOUSE WITH SOMEONE YOU AREN'T MARRIED TO!! When they die it goes to their next of kin, which is not you.  So now you own a house with his/her parents instead of owning the house outright.  It's a bad idea.

* It is always good to talk to a Lawyer about the legal rammifications.  As a Realtor, I can only give personal examples, a Lawyer can cite the laws.
* I know about tenancy by survivorship.  It's not as rock solid as tenancy by entirety (the legal rights given by marriage).  Again TALK TO A LAWYER.  As my lawyer tells me, the tenancy by survivorship can be severed, tenancy by entirety cannot be severed without a divorce, and the house will become part of the divorce.  Not to mention in a tenancy by survivorship, you can file a probate for more credit on a sale if you have made more financial contributions to a home.  "

145,"I relate to this so much. 

After going through a rough time myself, I took a long break from relationships to find myself and figure out my issues. Around 3 years. In that time I grew to be comfortable being alone. After recently figuring out my personal life, Ive been yearning for companionship and love. 

That feeling you’ve been having lately, is your gut and your heart telling you that you’re ready again."

We had our issues both as individuals and as a couple and were separated but we never stopped loving each other and we always knew that when the shit was at its deepest, we could count on each other. Now I need her support and comfort more than ever and it's because she is gone. So much has happened in 6 weeks and that yearning to be able to tell her is paralyzing. I hope you can find some peace in your loss and find a way to move on. Nobody deserves the kind of grief you and I have felt and continue to feel."

They got together and I said to my friend ""you're a fucking idiot. She cheated on another dude with you. What do you think happens when she gets bored with you or yall get into a fight?"" 

Fast forward a year. The idiot gets cheated on.

edit: since the reply below mine is getting toasted I will throw this out there. Cheating is the lowest of the low. If you have ideas of cheating on your SO break it off. No person deserves to be cheated on to forever wonder why they weren't enough or why you couldn't talk to them. If you are wanting to cheat you obviously do not love the person you are with so there is no reason to continue the relationship."

We worked together at an elementary school and I was taking over one of his after-school stipend assignments. I had a question about the assignment and the receptionist told me to go find him to ask. I did and he managed to relay instructions well enough. I was into him though so I tried to make things friendlier and extend the conversation- until he abruptly said that he had to “go sign the clock book with the numbers” meaning he had to go to the office to sign out for the day. It didn’t matter what time we did this and I also had to go sign said book, so I couldn’t wrap my head around why he ended the conversation that way. Later learned that something I did/said got him hard and we were obviously NOT in a setting where that was okay so he had to go walk it off, and he obviously couldn’t have told me about it at the time.

164,"Yes. 

The summer before high school I moved to a new state, towards the end of my freshman year I saw a girl walking past me who I had never seen before and I fell in love with her at first sight. She was the most physically attractive girl I had ever seen in my life up until that point, she also carried herself with confidence and was just intoxicating. I could not think, definitely could not speak. I wanted to ask her for directions to my class (cringe) or for a pen, or anything. I let her walk by and because summer was around the corner I thought I’d never get a chance to see her again. I spent that summer thinking about her and trying to Myspace (yikes) around to see if I could find her but I only managed to make four friends who happened to have a small Myspace network themselves so I failed miserably. 

As luck would have it, she ended up walking into my Spanish class the first day of 10th grade and sitting four rows away.

First, I'd want to pass on this quote from Mr. Rogers. He was a very wise human. ""Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.”

Second, I would want to emphasize that it's ok to talk about it. When we bottle things up they start to feel even bigger and even more unmanageable, but when we talk about it, it helps even the most difficult things feel more bearable. Communicate, even when it is difficult, because it's only through communication that we can heal.

*Edited to add: some cultures raise boys (and therein the men they become) to believe talking about and showing their feelings make them weak. Those cultures have some idiotic cultural norms. You're a living, breathing human being. You're going to have feelings. There's no shame in having feelings, and talking about those feelings doesn't make you weak. If anyone says or does anything to make you feel otherwise, they're a jerk.*

Third, I'd like to remind you that other people feel this, too. [This poem by Andrea Gibson](https://binged.it/2AL4AM0) is a worthwhile reminder that you're not alone in feeling this. It's ok to ask for help and it's ok to receive help. The crisis text line is 741741. They can help connect you to local counselors, as can your insurance company.

Fourth, you're obviously quite resilient. You're posting online looking for strategies to help life feel better. You remind me a lot of [this meme](http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a2NXEze_700b.jpg). If this isn't the stick you need, you keep asking and keep looking. I'm really proud of you for the ways you're being resilient. My inbox is always open.

*Edited a* *~~second~~* *third time to add:* Thank you for the silver, gold and platinum!"

I've posted this before too, but;

So in High School (and really ever since) I was kind of a goody two shoes.

I had this friend named Deloris though, she.. *was not*, at all. You name the teenaged criminality, she did it. She slept with teachers, her father's friends, she did every drug she could get hold of, bought &amp; sold, convinced her friends to sleep with dealers for drugs...

Really, *really* bad shit. And she was tired of it all. Tired of being afraid, tired of having to hide things, and lie.. So she came to me, the goody two shoes, for advice. She wanted to know how to get out of the whole game, how to leave it behind.

So I told her to fess up, go to her parents, the school administrators, the police, whoever, admit her guilt, take her lumps, she's sure to be kept away from temptation afterwords by the consequences.

And she agreed. She would do it, but she didn't want to take anyone down with her, didn't want to ruin her dad's friends lives, or give the dangerous individuals she'd worked for and with reason to come after her.

She could keep her mouth shut, but she'd kept records.

So she handed over a big mesh bag filled with notes, notebooks, disposable cameras.. And I had no clue what to do with it all. She told me, and I'll never forget:

&gt;Make sure nobody ever find these, smash the cameras, tear apart the notes, burn them, I don't care.

So.. I went home, pried the cameras open, unwound the film, tore up the notes, and piled the scraps up in small heaps on a small plate I had in my room for burning cone incense.

Two, three piles went in, burned, the smoke pulled out of my room via box fan, and the ashes flushed down the toilet, then my parents got home.

The fourth pile I ignited just after dinner, only this time I was interrupted, my mother called to my end of the house and insisted I come put away the dishes. The pile was ash, wasn't smoking any longer, but I couldn't let it sit as I'd planned. So I dumped the cold, no longer smoking ashes into my bedroom trashcan and placed the trashcan back in the floor of my closet where it belonged.

I go to the kitchen and start putting away dishes, not five minutes later, the smoke alarm goes off.

I know what's happened.

I rush to my room, as soon as I open the door, I can see I'm too late, my closet is bellowing flames halfway across my room, my ceiling, floor, and drapes are on fire..

Half the house burnt down to the concrete foundations, half was simply too smoke damage to save.

The only things that we could save were a few photo albums in the garage and a couple loads of laundry from the washer and dryer."

And I regret that in the moment after he asked I didn’t manage to think of something smart to say in her defence. I mumbled something about how there was more to a person than looks. Guess I was shocked. He had always seemed supportive of our relationship and it hurt to finally know that he actually thought she was too ugly for me to marry. I had planned on him being the best man - those plans died that night. Ugly girl and I are married three months now and I love her more than ever. "

It sucked. People would constantly tell me I was punching above my class, tell me that seeing us together was disgusting, tell me that they were going to make a pass at her and take me off her, sometimes right in front of her. 

Her friends would constantly tell her she could do better, tell her they couldn't understand what she could possibly see in me (note that I had never held a real conversation with any of these girls, they knew absolutely nothing about me), they would tell other guys she was single and try to goad them into hitting on her.

Her own mum once lied to her about what they were going out to do so she could ambush her with a surprise blind date with one of her friends sons *two years into our relationship*. 

We really cared about each other but all the shit just completely destroyed my self-esteem and sense of self-worth."

My ex was drop-dead gorgeous and it took me a long time to feel comfortable around her, I thought I had moved past the anxiousness when she changed her hairstyle. She used to wear her hair in a braid but decided to cut it shorter and give herself some bangs. She hadn't told me about this and we met up for lunch but I couldn't even make eye contact with her let alone talk to her more than a few sentences. She confronted me about why I was so aloof, she was quite flattered when I told her.

Second time was the last girl I asked out on a date. I figured I do it nonchalant so I asked if I could talk to her for a second, she looked me in the eye and said ""sure what's up,"" in that moment the blueness of her eyes was just overwhelming. Unfortunately after a 10 second moment of silence all I could say was ""god fucking dammit"" and walked away...

239,"Not sure if my story really fits, but...
I was divorced and had just ended a 5-year relationship, and she was in the process of getting a divorce when we met. I was supposed to be the rebound guy, her the rebound girl. Except we really, really liked each other. We both knew that there'd be issues if we continued to date, baggage of the other we'd be agreeing to work through, if we continued. We did. After about a year and a half I brought it up. You see when we began, we had told each other we never wanted to get married again, and neither of us had problems with that. When I told her I found myself willing to marry her, thinking of it, when I had never expected to feel that urge again, I didn't expect her to feel the same way. And she didn't.

She said the same thing, that she didn't want to get married. That she loved me and wanted to be with me forever, but she still didn't want to get married. So I told her. I told her that when we realized we had fallen in love, and had told each other, I vowed to myself that each morning I would wake up not assuming she was in love with me. That, in my first marriage, I hadn't worked hard enough, I made too many assumptions, was too lazy about my past love. I told her I didn't want to make the same mistake with her. You see, each morning I wake up without the assumption the love of my life is laying next to me. I approach each day with the goal to woo her, to have her realize she's in love with me, to express her love, to move in with me, and to, eventually, say yes to marrying me. The yes part was more important than the marriage itself. So that day, because I was feeling romantic and bold, I asked her to marry me. She said yes.

I didn't stop asking though, because a yes to get married didn't include a 'when' to get married. Since then I've proposed to her hundreds of times. And her me. It's become our thing, in times when we're most happy, usually the simple times, that we'd turn to the other person and ask for their hand in marriage. There are times I've looked at her and told her I've failed, that the day's events were too much, that I didn't think she would have fallen in love with me that day. She always tells me I'm wrong, smiling when she does, understanding that even on the hardest of hard days, I'm still thinking about us spending the rest of our life together.

I proposed on a month long road trip around the US. She proposed after a Pliny the Elder. I proposed during a day in bed marathoning Parenthood. There were fights so bad I asked if she'd say yes even then, and even then she said yes. She proposed one morning after breakfast, me during yoga, laying next to her in shavasana, mouthing the words to her. 

One Saturday, a summer Saturday like any other, beautiful and blue with a crisp wind coming off Lake Michigan, a Saturday that just happened to be the anniversary of the day we realized we were each other's 'one', she rolled over and said we should get married. So we did. We dressed up and went downtown, and Judge Katz married us at the courthouse six blocks from where we met, five from where we first kissed.

We still propose. I proposed to her on the way to the hospital, before she gave birth to our son. She proposed this past weekend, after a great little family adventure. This week has been rough - 12 hour work days and a teething toddler. Actually, I'm going to ask her to marry me right now.

She said yes. :D"

Actually I still don't know why I said ""maybe.."" I'm a emotional guy and sex wasn't on my mind especially when I think about her, at that time.. Probably I missed a good chance back there. Just a reminder: her friend was super hot tho. Now still we're good friends, she has a bf and I have a gf.

I didn’t think we were too compatible and told her it wasn’t going to work out and as an attempt to keep me on the hook she bought me two concert tickets to one of my favorite bands and told me I didn’t have to take her, she just wanted me to be happy.

253,"This was not me but my sister. She had been dating a guy for two or three years when my parents split up. She told her then boyfriend to absolutely positively not propose rn (she knew he was gearing up to do it) because her faith in relationships and the institution of marriage had taken a blow.

&amp;nbsp;

Boyfriend proposed anyway, and she said no. They had a house together that they were fixing up, but due to my parents splitting up my sister had nowhere else to live and they both moved in.

&amp;nbsp;

Boyfriend was in love and determined to make the relationship work at any cost. My sister was also in love, but was aware that they were fundamentally different people and wasn't sure she wanted to continue onwards, but also didn't want to end it in case it was the wrong decision. She finally decided to end it after almost a decade together. They stayed a couple six years after the failed proposal, but didn't have sex in all that time. They slept in the same bed every night with no intimate contact between them.

&amp;nbsp;

The guy was actually really nice and really cool. He had his issues (as do we all) but was definitely a good guy. Even still it was obvious to those of us on the outside that he and my sister were just too different to be together successfully. After the breakup, he started dating someone with two kids and I believe they moved in together. My sister started dating someone else, too, who she fell hard for.

&amp;nbsp;

That was until she discovered the guy had a girlfriend of two years who he was cheating on with her. The guy ""broke up"" with the other girl and is still with my sister. Oh, gosh, my sister..."

259,"These topics aren't a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer, but more things you'll have to assess based on how you know her. Personally, I find these value areas to be the source of the demise or success of most relationships: 

* **Outlook on money** and budgeting. You should be mostly similar if you want to build anything together. 
* **Maturity.** Life isn't a Disney fairytale. Is she ready to be your *partner* or does she want you to always put out her fires because ""you are the man""? Some guys disagree with me here though and are looking for a more traditional housewife type, so you may disagree and that's fine but, to me, this is important because I'm not looking for a dependent. 
* **Confidence**. Is she confident enough to not demand to, or secretly do so, go through your phone every time you innocently come home late or want to hang out with your friends? Jealousy doesn't show how much you love someone, it shows how insecure you are about yourself as being valuable. 
* **Emotional stability**. How does she react to negative in her life? If she melts down when Starbucks forgets her straw, that anger will eventfully be turned on you when you don't act as she wants. If her ex was always wrong, you will probably always be wrong in disagreements too. 
* **Love language.** You should be able to make each other feel appreciated naturally. If you feel appreciation through acts of service, she should recognize and respect that without too much work. If she does through words of affirmation, you should be able to roll off compliments without too much work too. 
* **Religious/Political Values**: if either of these are important to you or her, you should be almost identical. It's hard to reconcile these differences. Some people do, but it's still hard. "

267,"This was back in 2013, I had bad self esteem as a teen and when I was a junior I also ran with a ""bad"" crowd. We was i guess the stoner kids in school, we sold weed, bumed money off everyone, fought other kids, and smoked weed all the time. But we was pretty well liked by everyone in our small school of about 400 students. There was a  sophomore girl who was my complete opposite she was this very smart pretty blonde hair blue eyes girl. For some reason she had a massive crush on me (I guess it was a bad boy thing) she would stare at me from across the lunch room, and I would catch her and she quickly look away. 

One day we rode the same bus home and I ended up having to sit next to her. She scooted over to let me in the seat but not all the way over, so we didn't have any room between us. We talked for most the ride and I really liked her. At the end of the ride she gave me her number and told me to text her or add her on Facebook and that we should hang out outside of school. I gave her the paper with her number on it back and told her I didn't want to hang out with her. She had a disappointed look on her face, said ""oh ok"" and walked off the bus. I really liked her but was ashamed to tell people my family was too poor to afford a cell phone or internet. I tried to sit next to her the next day on the bus and she put her bag in the seat and looked out the window. She refused to talk to me after that and it still drives me nuts to this day because she was a very nice girl and I really liked her. 

We both work at the same Call Center now and she gave me some dirty looks when I first got hired on. She still pretty and single, I keep thinking about going for it but she probably hates me lol.

Update: so today at work i talked to her on lunch. She was cool and casually mentioned how i turned her down in high school. I explained why she was cool about it and gave me her current number. I texted her and literally just before this post asked if she would want to go to a movie and a bite to eat tomorrow night. Her respose was ""of course ❤"" so i think im in guys"

Suddenly I realized I was about to miss my turn, so I laid my bike over to turn, but I leaned too far and my bike skidded out from under me. 

I hit the asphalt with a bang loud enough to attract the woman who had caused this accident to inquire if I was alright. Instead of acting along and possibly getting to know her, I suddenly became self conscious of my folly and embarrassed, so much so that I stammered “I’m fine” and limped towards my dorm, red in the face with my jeans torn.

She pulls out a dozen roses and chocolate and gives it to me. Now this girl was really nice but I wasn’t attracted to her. I rejected the roses and chocolates and apologized to her.

When we got back with the equipment, she was the *first* and **only** person in the room that I could see for a few seconds. We live in a small town, and I had never seen this girl before. I went up to talk to her, intending to ask her “which school do you go to?” (we had 3 in our area at the time) but instead it came out “Do you go to school here too?” I still get those moments, like when she’s in lounge wear.

304,"I've been with girls who hated when I would attempt to problem solve things in their life. Like when they would complain to me about work,school,etc I'd always try and come up with solutions when really all they wanted was to vent and let me hear them out. I just didn't understand why they didn't want my help and just wanted someone to vent to. Then recently as I was binging through parks and rec, one of the couples on the show had the exact same problem. So it must be pretty common..

EDIT: alright this has gotten a lot more attention than I thought it would. Let me clarify that I don't really have a problem with this. I actually love being able to play the role of venting buddy to my SO. I see nothing wrong with it. I just instinctively want to find a solution to the problem because I want to help."

309,"As soon as I started dating my gf, my sister and my friends gave me shit for it.  I’m considered attractive by others, but I guess others cannot see the beauty that I see in my gf.  Even my gf is insecure when she sees pics of my exes.  

However, I wouldn’t trade her for any of them.  She’s been through hell: dad died from cancer when she was 6, lived with physically abusive mom until 18, survived three cancer treatments, got stabbed during a robbery, beat up by sister’s bf, etc.... She has more character than most of those people combined.  She has more appreciation for life.  She’s also one of the most humble and kindest individuals I ever met.  

I call her my diamond in the dirt, because only I can see how awesome of a person she is.  

Edit:  After some feedback, this post is starting to make me cringe.  I’m going to try to explain some stuff, and I hope I don’t just mess things up worse.  

My girlfriend is beautiful, and I find her very attractive.  She does have tattoos, which puts my super conservative family off.  Also, she has a very colorful past, which my friends know about.  Her past doesn’t bother me, and I love her tattoos.   But, I’ve been questioned why I’m dating her.  

Now, for the diamond in the rough comment.  Yes, I am that obtuse.  But, she actually likes it, and I’ll explain why.  As mentioned earlier, my girlfriend has a colorful past.  I’m not going to go into it, but let’s just say a lot of guys avoid her because of it.  (Her words, not mine).  Her past didn’t phase me, and as a result, I ended up dating one of the most amazing girls ever.  That’s why I call her my diamond in the rough.  Because of her past, she gets overlooked a lot.  But, if people would look beyond her past, they’d discover one of the most kindest and interesting people alive.

310,"There’s a traditional song in my dad’s culture with lyrics roughly translating to “Hurray, we married off the awkward ugly girl”. I’ve only ever heard it sung ironically—like my dad sings it when he regifts a crappy Christmas present for instance—but it originated as a genuine song that used to be sung by the girl’s parents and other family in front of the bride and groom.

Edit: I’m not sure exactly how to translate it but the word for “awkward” has more of a “bull in a China shop” connotation, and the word for “ugly” is much harsher, closer to hideous. It’s super mean."

Holy shit felt horrible rejecting her. 

There was also the time my husband got sexy for me and surprised me right after I'd been working late and I was exhausted. I was blindsided so I just kinda said no not tonight without being you know nice/gentle/letting him know how hot it was. It was pretty crushing cause he really worked himself up for it and I was just like nah bruh.

318,"My wife was a known flight risk and she had turned down two proposals before me. To say I was nervous was an understatement. I had prepped her mentally as she had already professed her love for me and wanting to move forward with me but I think the act of proposing and getting married scared the shit out of her. In my mind I had a series of contingency plans should she say no or leave me at the alter. Call it cold hearted or whatever but I knew that she at any point between the proposal to the actual marriage would be a potential shut down of our relationship. I don't think I breathed a sigh of relief until after our ceremony and we had a year and a half proposal so for two years I was a nervous wreck trying to make sure that she didn't book it on me randomly.

I told her about my contingencies about two years ago a little after our first daughter was born. She laughed and said yeah, she almost ran for the hills on me 5 times, even on the day of our wedding so my instincts weren't wrong.

I think after having two kids, four deaths in the family (3 on her side, 1 on mine) plus suicide has made us really strong together."

325,"I've had the good fortune of having been with some very attractive people, and my family (mom, for the most part), would comment on the matter. Not a persistent thing, though. Usually just the once when they first meet or see them. 

But one particular ex, after meeting her for the first time, my mom asked me ""So, you're really attracted to her, huh?"" It made for some stark contrast to my first girlfriend, for example, who got comments of ""TorpedoBench, she's *gorgeous*."" I was rather taken aback at the time; of course I found her attractive, and the incredulity my mom asked me with stung.

But, that ex turned out to be abusive. Took over a year for the relationship to end, and she still found ways to abuse me after it ended. Now, I can't fathom how I was attracted to her in the first place. Perhaps my mom saw something I couldn't."
326,"When a girl is excited to see me it’s about as good as it can get. When I wasn’t single my gf would do this little skip step when she saw me which melted me every time. It was like just the sight of me made her day. Then she ripped my heart out but that’s beside the point.

Also legitimate compliments. I think women often underestimate the power of a genuine compliment. I go from 0 to interested in 0.3 seconds when a girl gives me a compliment on what I already consider a personal strength."
327,"This'll sound weird but the World of Warcraft books. Lots of them focus heavily on 1on1 character development and as such you can often learn a great deal about people just from reading and dissecting, even about yourself. One of my favourite lines ever, most likely paraphrasing awfully:

331,"Pretty much same experience here. Got cheated by my wife of 14 years 3 years ago. The pain was unbearable. Divorced and never dated or interested in anyone. And tell you what, that **something** that you yearn is being in love *and* a companion

Just about 3 months ago, some friends invited me for a small birthday dinner. And there I met her, my high school friend but rarely get along with us all these years. Someone who I never thought about, who I haven't met for more than a decade. And guess what, she was single all these years.

I mean I didn't have any plan to seeing anyone before. I refuse some friends effort to matchmaking me with their lady friends. I just don't want to be in a relationship again because of the traumatizing experience and the freedom I've had all these time after I moved on.

But I was struck again finally. Feel like a teenager again but godamnit if I say I didn't enjoy the feeling

Long story short, we're dating now and plan to go to the next step next year. We're both in our 40's so no more wasting time too much

And that **something** you talked about is fulfilled. It's really amazing being in love, and commit yourself to someone again

Open up yourself, socialize more, and one day when you finally meet that someone and got struck, trust me ... you'll feel like a new person again

Best of luck, buddy"
332,"Not really romantic just me being very very stupid. And I've regretted it ever since

 For around 6 months me and my best mate would make out whenever we drank and she would offer to come back to mine etc but I always chickened out and never acted on it. 

One day she offered me a threesome with another girl and I thought they were joking so proceeded to get blackout drunk.

A couple weeks pass and I've stopped seeing her and never thought about it, just thought it was something that we did in a club. However I should have realised as she made a pact to marry me at a certain age at this point.

A few years pass and we're still best friends and she now has a boyfriend. She ends up having a brain tumour removed and I go see her after she's out of hospital and she finally asks me about it as she'd never asked about that time of our lives before. That's when I realise, I'm a fucking idiot and missed a chance with a great girl.

Two years later she's single again, and we decide to see what happens, nothing happens as we talk about it like adults and realise that were both different people than we were those years ago.

Then someone told me that if someone makes a pact with you, date them as it means they like you

344,"This feeling comes and goes for me. I had a pretty bad breakup a few years back with some ultra shitty circumstances involved and it set me back. I’ve been single for 5 years now but I like to think of some of the benefits:

1. My career took off about a year after my break up because I was able to dedicate a lot more time to work. 

2. My bank account is much larger than it would be if I were still in a relationship. 

3. Do what I want, when I want to.

4. My health has improved by spending more time in the gym. I know this is achieved by men in relationships but not for me. 

However, none of this can fix feeling lonely at night. It doesn’t happen often but it does happen. It sucks but that feeling won’t be my driving force towards finding a relationship."

346,"I didn't quite get to the point of proposal. We had been dating for 3 years, and for the last couple of months we had been discussing life plans - marriage, honeymoon plans, living together, etc. I lived on the other side of town, and my lease was about to end, so I decided to move closer to her. Around that time I started shopping for a ring. Her best friend's husband took me out for drinks and asked me my intentions, and said that he hoped his son would be able to call me uncle in the near future. I took that as a good sign.

About a month before my lease ended, we spent a really great day together just hanging out and running errands around town. I had been working on wedding vows in my head, which is a super-cheesy thing I never thought I'd do, and that day the vows were taking the shape of ""you know you've found the one when you go grocery shopping together and it feels like you won the lottery.""  That night, she called me and said she wanted to break up. I laughed initially, because it seemed so random. She continued by saying that she couldn't see a future with me and didn't really want to talk about it. I asked her to take a couple of weeks away from me to think about it, and to maybe talk it over with friends. She didn't discuss it with any of our mutual friends, who were completely shocked. During our brief break, I pretty much knew it was already over. We spoke again two weeks later, and she said she'd made up her mind but still wanted to be friends. Something about how she handled it made me realize that she'd seen the relationship entirely differently - I was in my forties, making 5 year plans around our relationship. She didn't take it that seriously.

I told her in no uncertain terms that I couldn't maintain a friendship with her. That was the last time we ever spoke.

I spent the next year or so sorting through a pile of emotions. First, and most importantly, all of my plans had burned down. I had to find a new place to live, I couldn't stand commuting to my job anymore (which was two blocks from her house), and I had no idea what I'd do next. Eventually I moved to another city to be closer to family and start over.

Second, there was the sense of worthlessness. I felt (and feel) discarded, and it took me a long time to get over that. I still harbor some resentment about the situation, but in the end, I'm glad I know what kind of person she is and that I didn't have to discover that after I'd made a serious legal commitment.

Third, there was the problem of distrust and suspicion. I'm still working on this. It's been nearly three years, and it's still pretty hard for me to imagine forming any sort of trusting relationship with a partner without assuming the worst. I've also become a lot more uncompromising about my own wants and needs - like, this is my life, I'm going to live it the way I want, and if that doesn't work for you, too bad. (This might also just be me getting curmudgeonly.)

358,"Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

Written by a man who was a psychologist before being put in a concentration camp during WWII.

I ran across this book while doing time at the lowest point in my life and never before had I audibly said ""Holy fucking shit"" while reading a book because this man blew my mind and changed my life for the better, forever.

""We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our question must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.""

This book is regarded as one of the ten most influential books in the US.

365,"woman here;  ive had anxiety since i was little and my boyfriend has adapted a few things that have made such a difference for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

a big and easiest one is that **he never throws it back in my face when he has to leave a bar or something to take me home bc I started having a panic attack** or something. When he helps me it's with a kind heart and he **doesn't mention that somethings putting him out or annoying he will just help** me in whatever way I need

&amp;#x200B;

sometimes when I get whipped up and in a loop talking about the same thing that's pissing me off when I'm done he'll **ask if I want feedback or just to talk**. communication like this makes all the difference bc sometimes you just need to rant and don't what to hear advice just say what you're feeling. 

**communication really is the big** one I think. In all aspects. If they aren't very good at communicating there's stuff you can do to help foster that kind of dynamic, like just asking questions like if they want advice or just to talk, if they want a hug/cuddle or just have someone around 

&amp;#x200B;

lastly snacks and tea - its a little thing but means a lot to me **when he sees im upset or whatever and will ask if i want some tea or just goes and makes me a cup or a snack**. a little caring act like that goes a long way"
366,"Right? Like the only way you could possibly be attracted to them is because it's a ""fetish"" or because Kdrama/Kpop fanatics have made Korean men into a ""fad"". I get that sort of passive probing a lot too. It astounds me how flagrant people can be.

392,"I'm 5'5"", and also kinda ugly, but I never really had social anxiety, either. The only advice I can really give is to keep in mind that most people are too busy being self-concious about themselves to worry about you, and if you're talking with someone, try to keep them talking about themselves more than you talk about yourself. It also helps if you're honestly interested in what they have to say.

The other person typically picks up on this common social cue, and will ask how my wife is doing on subsequent meetings.  That's typically enough for me to get past the initial crush/fantasy impression and get back to business.  

Whatever you do, don't entertain fantasies about people you know outside of your relationship...that will cause you nothing but grief.

422,"Damn, everyone in that place fucked you up."
423,"My first wife had borderline personality disorder (we have been divorced for 8 years now) She had no interest in managing it and trying to help her on my own really messed me up a lot. You can't lose yourself for them. You have to remember that you are independent and a separate person and they still need to be accountable.

I recently got out of a relationship with a woman who I'm pretty sure is  a narcissist (I'm noticing a pattern) and her behaviors seriously triggered my past trauma from my BPD ex. With the recent ex, I'm in a foggy place of not being sure if my past experience just exasperated the problems and she was just very selfish and not really that bad, or she really was NPD. 

Basically, if you stay with someone who has mental health issues and they are not totally committed to managing their issues and completely rely on you, it has the potential to mess you up for the rest of *your* life too, so really consider how deep you want to go."
424,"There's lots of good advice here about what you can do for your SO, so let me add to it that caring for yourself is essential. Depending on the nature of the mental health issue, there can be challenging days when you may be in the firing line for negativity, anger, tears, manipulation (all of this is meant descriptively and non-judgmentally). It can also be worrying, especially if you are in a relationship with someone whose depression gives rise to a risk of suicidal thoughts. It is very important that you feel safe in yourself and your own boundaries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't ever get into a relationship thinking that you can save or rescue someone: that's not what relationships are for, and in any case if you love someone it should be unconditional insofar as possible. Don't become a therapist and don't take responsibility for the SO's difficulties. Love them, treat them with care, but know that the best way to look after anyone is by being okay in yourself first. And know that whatever they are going through it is not your fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us will experience a mental health problem at least once in our lives, so it seems reasonable to assume that most of us will therefore also be in a relationship with someone who experiences a mental health problem. There are differences between being with someone who has, say, a depressive episode and someone who has a longer term condition. Either way, being understanding and accepting the other person with love is important, but it's okay to find it really difficult and challenging.

446,"I definitely get this. Two weeks ago, I passed the three year mark being single out of a 4 year relationship but didn't really take note of it till this past week. My ex has already blown through two relationships, one being an engagement, and two suicide attempts since we broke up. There was a lot of rotten lying and I don't even know if I got cheated on or not. I don't mention that to gloat that ""oh, look I'm doing better than her"", but more of the fact that even though it was over, I still really cared. It hurt how quickly she moved on, it hurt knowing that she tried to take her own life when she knew I still cared. It took a while to get over. It took a lot. Hell, I don't even know what ""over it"" means. I took a long term work assignment abroad and sometimes ask myself what I'm even looking for at this point. It's hard not to notice seeing love wherever it presents itself. It's even weirder having the internet and seeing so many friends getting married back home while I'm doing my own thing. So far, I'm just trying to get better at the local language and see all the things that I wouldn't have gotten to see had I never come here. Just feels like I'm trying to stay busy sometimes.

I think the weirdest thing about not having anyone to share it with is just the fact that I have the opportunity to see so much of the beauty that's in the world, and trying to share what that's like after the fact just makes you that guy with the boring travel story that nobody wants to hear. Having someone to share it with adds a level of meaning to it that simple words don't really describe. In my mind, a tame walk in the park with my ex carries more significance than the mountain I climbed last weekend solo. It sucks, but some days it feels like the only meaning our lives have is the meaning we give it."

- Waking up in the morning next to the person I love, watching their sleepy eyes open and giving them an early morning kiss.

- Cuddling up on the couch to a good movie. Falling asleep halfway through is optional but encouraged.

- I would be lying if I said I didn’t miss the sex. Being in love with the person you’re having sex with makes it enjoyable tenfold.

- Feeling their breath on my neck and the weight on my chest, stroking their hair as they sleep. A lot of this is sleep related but that’s because sleep is great.

- Admiring their smile, hearing their laugh, and most importantly, that warm, washover feeling of hearing them say “I love you.”

461,"I'm probably one of the shortest on this subreddit at 4ft, due to Achondroplastic dwarfism.

My teenage years were hell. And I was extremely angsty. I didn't understand how I could live a normal life, or be seen as normal by other people. 

But when I turned 19 or so, I really seemed to overcome this outlook. It was like a baptism by fire kind of deal. 

Giving a shit about this stuff was going to change *nothing*. Absolutely nothing. I would live my life and die, feeling withdrawn and miserable about something I couldn't change. So fuck it. There's nothing inherently *wrong* with my body. It is what it is, and I get to decide how I feel about it and how I act with it. It is greatest instrument I will ever own, and it's magnificent.

And I love it now. I love my body, and I have for the last 5 years. I get told by people that they envy my self confidence and how unshakable I seem to be. And acting that way bleeds into the rest of my life. People like hanging out with me, and I've had to turn down dates (I'm asexual).

The bus drives up to my stop, the doors open, I start getting on the bus and look up to greet the driver and I’m face to face with a gorgeous guy. Took me completely by surprise. I stopped dead in my tracks (holding up the line of people waiting to get on behind me), and dropped my card.

464,"My take from this book wasn’t the surveillance stuff. It was the climax. When the bad guy admits everything they do is purely for the sake of power.  No grand divine vision. No moral mandate. No principles or beliefs for a better world. Power for power’s sake. Everything comes back to that.

When I listen to politicians or pundits try to sell platforms, talking points, or narratives I always allow for the simple explanation that this person is lying to gain power. Their reasonings, stories, narratives, arguments, statistics...all just seductions to gain power over me. 

Which leads me to the ultimate question: who gains more from me voting for them? Them or me? Who gains more from this new law? Those in power or the citizens? Who gains from this new regulation? The workers or the owners?

It’s all just a power game in the end.

471,"I met a girl once. She was beautiful - the lead in a play for my college, and I was doing Sound and Lighting. We had a cast event at a restaurant, and while picking seats I of course took the opportunity to sit next to her (she gave a wry smile at me as I did). We hit it off that night, and I got her number. 

We were both musicians, so we found ourselves in the practice rooms together, playing. But, when we began to talk more, I realized some things about her I wasn’t as attracted to. Political views that didn’t mix, personality traits that were hard to handle, etc. It was enough for me to know that it would not work in the future. So, I explained to her (some of) my thoughts, and, as nicely as possible, separated myself. I could see that she didn’t take it well, but then I made an effort to stay friends with her.

Fast forward a year or so later, we had both moved away to different states. One night I got a text from her. She had a way of being attractive with her words. Hard to explain. But I took the bait and texted back, which began a casual conversation for a few weeks. I didn’t think much of it, but she must’ve thought that we were “talking” again, and some feelings arose.  

On my birthday, she sent me a card, and on the card was a flash drive. She had written a series of songs for me, each articulating a trait about me that she loved. They were well written and I knew she spent some serious time on them.  The card was over the top.

I stopped talking to her completely and did not mention the card or anything. Just cut off communication. 

I felt absolutely terrible, but for some reason could not simply pick up my phone and explain to her what I was feeling. It ate at me for a while, and eventually (months later), I apologized and talked to her about it. She took it surprisingly well and said she knew it was a long shot (to my relief), and we remain friends to this day.

472,Pff.. Big spender over here.. 20 guitars is enough for the average man but this greedy fuck had to go off and get 21. Show off
473,"&gt; I have to disappoint you, I never had the guts to tell her (in time). That sounds just as bad as it was.

Hey man, I have a good 7 of those. Wish I would have had more balls back in the day, but you live and you learn.  
  
So... if you guys have crushes out there, read NMMNY and just fucking ask her man."
474,"For bipolar - don't fight back (verbally, I mean) when they're having an episode. It just makes everything worse for everyone involved. "
475,"It's treason, then. "
476,"Exactly. This isn’t marriage. One may not want kids now but they may in the future. Obviously, “I never want kids” should be a deal breaker if you want kids, but “not yet” answers, to any question, aren’t. "
477,"Totally! Luckily, I had the good sense to not sleepwalk into marriage, but instead observed all my peers doing so in their 20's. Starting out with bobby pins all over, and before you know it, moving in together and getting a dog just kinda.... Happens. And watching it unfold is depressing AF"
478,"I really don't like this idea people have of ""winning"" or ""losing"" at dating based on attractiveness... Looks are important, but that's just the wrong way to approach it. "
479,"Sounds like a similar experience to mine. My girlfriend is a cute black and hispanic girl. She was going to prom with me, and she wanted to keep her prom dress a surprise. I'm standing in her living room in a full tux, waiting for her, and my knees weakened at seeing this tall, slim girl in a rose gold and white cocktail dress. She asked if I liked it, and all I could manage is the sound of a wraspy moose."
480,You're lucky she didn't take your kidneys and put you in bathtub full of ice.
481,"Same!  

One of them asked me out repeatedly and I kept rejecting her because I was convinced it was a joke.  I apologized to her years later.  A couple years ago we were chatting, realized we were both single.  I asked her to coffee a few times over the course of some months and I was told ""not now, maybe another time."" I finally got the hint.   Seemed fair I guess since I had rejected her. "
482,"I suspected a single friend of mine was feeling this way, I made sure to reach out to her on a consistent basis and always did my best to make time for her. The group of friends that are married/relationship always invite her, involve her and make time for her specifically to talk about or do what interests her. 

I've seen it make a big difference in the past many months. It may not be much but we try."
483,This is... oddly specific. You doing okay mate?
484,"My current girlfriend did it to me. The day I met her I was dumbfounded at how gorgeous she is, but she really got me this one time.

We worked together at a fetish shop at the time and unknown to me, had been flirting. I never thought it was gonna work out and resolved myself to being her friend. Fast forward a few months and this really beautiful chain top came in. Its something I'd really wanted to see on someone because it was sexy. She mentioned that she was gonna pick one up for herself and in my convinced friend mind asked if I could see it on after she tried it on. She said sure! In the moment she asked if anyone else was in the store, told her no and then she comes out completely topless. 

I tried my best to put on a fellow perverts friendly ""that looks great on you!"" And believed I did until after we started dating and she told me I looked like I'd eaten ghost peppers from how red I got. She went on to explain that that was her last effort to find out if i actually liked her because she'd been flirting with me a lot and I kept not getting it. Obviously I was about her and shortly later we started dating. 

That was almost three years ago and were planning on getting married. 

Hope this put a smile on your face like it does me. I still get teased everytime we tell that story because I literally broke for the remainder of the shift when I'm normally good at conversation. "
485,"When I met my wife, we were out to dinner with some friends. When we were seated, the doors to the outside were wide open, and the Sun was pouring in, reflecting off the hardwood floor, and lighting up her face, especially her sky blue eyes. 

That was it and I was hooked. I still to this day don’t know how I had enough confidence to talk to her on my own, let alone ask her out. But every time I think about this (and this happened 10 years ago), it gets a few extra beats out of my heart. "
486,"My wife is the opposite (in an adorably hilarious/endearing way). She bought lingerie, then came into the bedroom and proceeded to ""Act sexy"".

I couldn't stop laughing and she got mad. 

On the other hand, when she isn't thinking about it, and does something that's just, yeah, mindblowing to me and I'm like, ""Heh, hey there..."" To which she replies ""Oh, lord, not this again."""
487,Ain't that the truth..
488,"Rip rip open up the packet it's real, with the non stop wholemeal and gorgeous veal."
489,She wants the squash bro 
490,"Do you have an example of this: ""I've seen men on reddit who will post ""Yea,I'm taking a break from dating, I'm still hurt my ex gf cheated on me"" and then get called ""lol niceguy""?

What doesn't help is when those socially awkward men who pride themselves on being nice have a sense of entitlement just because they are ""nice"" 

They don't get a pass for being disrespectful, rude, demanding, entitled, or creepy just because they're ""nice"" "
491,"Thigh-high boots. I was a professional fashion photographer in my 20’s, so it’s been a really long time since hotness melted my brain, but thigh-high boots.

Legs coming out of a swimsuit? I’m good, no matter how nice they are, but that strip of skin between the hem of a skirt and some thigh-high boots."
492,"I think its from the throwaway culture that has moved into dating now. Why bother to put in any effort to a Tinder or Bumble match conversation when you can just swipe 50 more times and get new ones? It's the feeling that there's always something better hiding around the corner so any perceived minor flaw becomes a deal breaker. The problem is 2-5 messages don't usually actually show any flaws, it's just people's unrealistic expectations to begin with. "

508,"Oh my god yes. Everyone is so latched on to this ideal movie proposal; people, this is real life, asking someone to make a massive life decision in the spur of the moment under pressure is a BAD IDEA. Sure, it works sometimes, if you both really know that it's where the relationship is going, but more often than not it's just an impulse decision that has huge potential to backfire."

I told her I didn't feel that way yet and I didn't want to lie to her. I finally said it about two months later and she said ""welcome to the love boat""...so yah you are not alone. "
512,"Man, it takes someone else saying it for you to really be able to get the right words for it. I have been single for 7yrs, and though being able to do your own thing is great, I would like to have that guy who I can just share with. Or another pair of hands to help you replace the kitchen faucet.

524,"My situation was a little different from the question but I think it still works. I was not told no from my girlfriend but rather from her mom. My girlfriend’s dad had terminal cancer and I knew how important it was for my girlfriend to have her dad at the wedding and we had no idea how long he was going to be alive for. 

My girlfriend and I had only been dating a few months but I felt like she was the one and I thought she would say yes so the next step was to ask her parents for permission. My girlfriend spent all of her free time with her dad, helping him around the house and such so I decided to invite my girlfriend’s mom out to lunch and to ask her blessing before asking her dad because it would be hard to get to him without my girlfriend knowing. I took her mom out and asked her for her blessing and she told me something along the lines of “You aren’t ready to provide for my daughter and until you are in a more stable place in your life, I can’t give you my blessing and I will do everything in my power to make sure you don’t marry my daughter”. 

At this point in my life I was 21 years old, working at Jack in the Box, driving a shitty 1994 Ford Explorer that was constantly breaking down, and I was living with my mom. Being told that I couldn’t marry my girlfriend was hard. I had never had a parent not like me before and I felt personally attacked by her mom. This also meant that there was a good chance my girlfriend would never have a wedding where her father was able to attend which meant I failed in fulfilling a life long dream of my girlfriend’s. 

I am now married to that girlfriend, her dad did attend the wedding, and I was able to get blessings from both her mom and dad. Her dad is now passed but he was like a father to me and her mom and I have a pretty great relationship now. That girlfriend and I have been married for 3 years now. 

*Bonus: here is the conversation I had with the dad when I asked for his blessing:

Him: Do you love her?

Me: Yes.

Him: Do you like her?

Me: Yes.

Him: Then marry the girl! 

I miss him 24/7. "
525,"I keep the bush trimmed and the balls shaved on an ongoing basis because both myself and my partner prefer it that way. It's just part of the shower routine.

If I'm expecting to get head, I'll generally try to at least wipe down with a washcloth. If my partner approaches me for sex and I don't feel clean, I'll usually hop in the shower and get at least the important parts clean. Brushing teeth would depend on how recently I've brushed and what I've had to eat and drink since then.

If I need to pee or am close to it I'll do so, as the pressure on the bladder can get uncomfortable and pull me out of the moment.

Edit to add: sometimes spontaneity does win out on both our sides. We both generally aspire to be reasonable clean before sex, but sometimes the hotness of just going for it is very worth it."

530,"Woman here.

She’s probably been fed a lot of bad dating advice over the years and is afraid of looking clingy.

A lot of women’s dating advice tells us that you must basically make the guy do all the work because “men love to pursue/love the chase.” So if you text him first, it makes you look “too easy” and he’ll lose interest in you.

It’s soooo stupid but it took me YEARS to realize how bullshit all that is. She probably just truly believes her behavior is what guys want."
531,"We have an unreasonably reasonable relationship. The biggest fight we've ever had (and I am not kidding) is whether or not to put a pizza directly on the rack vs on a baking sheet. And we settled on ""we each like different pizzas, so do whatever the hell you want to your own pizza."""

What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.""

540,"When I was in college I had a 3 hour long class once a week. The course matter was really boring as this was one of those required classes that I needed to fulfill my minor that really had nothing to do with the subject I was studying. The teacher was also incredibly boring and would treat the class more as a lecture rather than a learning experience. So on the first day, college-me tried looking around the room to find a girl I could stare at for most of the class to preocuppy myself. Everyone took their seats and mostly everyone in the class was a guy, and the few girls in the class I wasn't really interested in. So I felt pretty defeated.
Then this absolutely gorgeous girl runs in late and takes a seat across the room from me.  ""Sweet"" I think. ""She's way out of my league but at least I'll have some pretty girl to look at."" 

We've been dating for about 2 1/2 years now and just moved in together. Life's pretty crazy huh? "

560,"I think the biggest takeaway from this thread is two fold: take a step back and really try and fathom if they feel the same about the relationship as you do. Like do they put as much in as you, do they seem as excited as you. Secondly, bring up the idea of marriage and discuss their expectations/desires for it. 

If both of those line up it seems unlikely to go wrong. Seems like MOST of the stories here stemmed from situations where those two things didn’t click.

It seems like it should be uplifting but it will never go well. Even if their is zero chance of them getting back together (and barring death, it's never really zero), they still chose to invest a substantial portion of their life and emotional energy in that person and by trashing their ex, it's basically like calling them an idiot and it's virtually impossible not to take personally.

589,"Money, money, money. It's cited in the top 3 reasons for divorce, always. It permeates every single aspect of life. It reflects so much more than just money - like spending, food, travel, debt, education, hobbies. It's not a ""sexy"" topic like what kind of house you want or kids' names or family relationships, nor is it a ""visible"" topic like hobbies or importance of friends in one's life. Money mismanagement and differing goals are really freakishly easy to overlook in dating.

I'm an accountant who works for estate and financial planners. Money can cause resentment, logistical issues, and ill-aligned expectations. It is always on your mind in a relationship where there's a difference in mindset - your SO leaves the lights on? they buy the organic milk? they get the dog the most expensive dog food? Yeah... those things are issues, but it's also reflected in money.

Money matters. A lot. And for some reason, people think it's tacky to discuss, but I, in my practical ways, would LOVE to see credit reports alongside STD tests before you move in with someone, or even date them seriously. Finding out that you're on the hook for your SO's dozens of thousands in debt, or that they think that 3 vacations per year is acceptable... is bad news, at best "
