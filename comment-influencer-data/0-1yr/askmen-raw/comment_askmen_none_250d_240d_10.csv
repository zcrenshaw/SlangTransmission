1,"Maybe they are but you can sort through the good/helpful posts vs the cult ones. /r/SelfImprovement l really helped to change my life, I just wanted to share what worked for me. "

3,Beets. Bears. Battlestar galactica. 
4,"&gt; I wouldn’t be talking to my male friends, fem or not. 

&gt; Theyre just probably not going to be our style for our friend group.

Ok I guess we wouldn't be friends "
5,Yeah but most people complaining about frequency tend to say that it was plentiful early in the relationship. How can you verify back then?
6,Like 8 months ago I think. Had opportunities since then but I just wasn't interested at the time
7,"I know it's not the end of the world I am also happy for him(somewhat, had it been a similar job I would be really happy) I just don't know how to deal with it right now. "
8,Or when you shit on your dick
9,"I assumed it was something of that nature, but I was not 100%.

Thank you for sharing."
10,"Depends on what you mean by ""wingmanning"". 

If it means helping her get laid, then she shouldn't exactly need my help, but if she's too shy or whatever, one could tell the guy in minced words that she's DTF and hope he'd take the hint and do the legwork for her.

If it means helping her to get together with a guy where they're both interested in each other but also both too chicken to do something about it, one could inform the guy that it's a safe thing, that he doesn't risk rejection when hitting on her, and hope he'd take the hint and do the legwork for her.

If it means helping her get together with a guy (either carnally or more) who isn't interested in her, well, good luck then because I am not a magician. "
11,"Is the cash visible to me at the time? If I can see it, I'm much more prone to getting to the weird stuff. "
12,Answer my question. I've already made my decision that has been haunting me for the past 5 years. What's the easiest / fastest way to die?
13,"Yeah, my first serious girlfriend in my 20's.   
We were together for about a year but we lost that feeling for each other by month 9. We stayed together for a bit just because we didn't know how to break up with one another.   
Took me a while to figure out we were just in lust."
14,You alright bro? Would you like to have a talk with the nice people at r/suicide watch?

17,"My mum was unwell for quite a few years with dementia and if anything I grieved more when she was still alive because of how it impacted her, once she passed away it was relief that she was at peace.  Whereas I lost a brother who was only mid thirties and 10 years on I still struggle with it."
18,Winning the lottery or becoming financially independent otherwise.
19,"It's not, no. It's not a cure, even. It's a tool to help you understand yourself and check your irrational views, the lies you tell yourself, and all the unhealthy pattern that you have. It worked for lots and lots of people, but you have to take the step to admitting you have a problem and that you want to fix it first. Which is the hardest step by the way. You are not broken beyond repair, but you have to be willing to fix it. I believe in you. Get the pain out, let yourself be vulnerable, and get yourself some help. Good luck my man."
20,but.. he’s an ex
21,"Not this time, I'm not. But if you're scared to do it, you probably don't really want to do it.
So please, talk to someone"
22,"According to all known laws of aviation, a Bee should not be able to fly"
23,"I take it you're from the States? I'm from Europe where we have all those social systems. (and pay taxes through the nose to support them) Sadly it's not as if when those problems are suddenly fixed all other problems will go away, and new ones don't pop up. Greed and tax evasion also aren't right or left issues.

I would love lower taxes and free stuff too. Hell, before the migration crisis I was a big supporter of guaranteed basic income. But that's realistically just not possible at this time. Over time, especially if renewable energy sources become more efficient, I think it can be, but forcing change too soon can make the situation a whole lot worse, especially when we've basically been expecting a recession to hit again for a while now, and it finally looks like it's about to happen. And if it turns into something bigger, which I think is very likely, things could get a whole lot worse.

On the upside, times like that often bring change. Out of the last one, we saw the emergence of blockchain and crypto's, which I personally think can be a game changer. And we saw local towns and cities pulling together in a lot of inspiring ways.

I'm not against rich people being rich or rich people making more money. People like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet earned it, and I think it would be unethical to steal their money and distribute it communist style. I think the financial incentives for a very large part have driven the very technological innovation that is now slowly enabling us to consider things like universal basic income in the firstplace. I do think the financial debt based system itself is fundamentally flawed and governments and beaurocratic systems like the EU are way too large, inefficient, invasive, and corrupt.

But I have faith in humanity and technology. I've seen way too much progress in so many areas over the last decade alone that makes me very hopeful. I'm far more concerned about the current political climate though. Politics is so pervasive these days and I've never experienced as much polarization as I have today."
24,Stop the self pity and leave. Do you know how lucky you are having no kids and maybe other things that would otherwise make it harder?
25,"That's why I'd rather be single and have no desire to have a gf. 

Why work for something when you can do whatever the hell you want on your own.

The expectation for example to text each day or do things together when you don't want to.

It's like a chore. "
26,"I don’t know what race you are, but is there a negative connotation or a cultural/religious expectation attached? For eg I have an Afghani friend who doesn’t approach middle eastern looking girls because he isn’t Muslim anymore, and doesn’t want to deal with it. "
27,No joke. Dude. I'm not gonna make you do anything. I just want to listen

32,"Sex, cuddling with my female best friend, cars"
33,"I recently got engaged. We have been together 4 years, we used to have sex so often. Every time we saw each other, all night, until we hurt or had to sleep. 

Now it’s every month, maybe longer between. Sure it’d be great to do it more often, but in all honesty I don’t care. I adore her and she adores me. I couldn’t be more excited to marry her. 

I don’t know if it’s because we are tired from work, not interested in sex as much or something else. I honestly don’t care. "
34,"How she treats her parents, some girls/guys can be real a-holes to loved ones. "
35,"Whoops, trying to build a career as an actor/filmmaker here

45,"""We talked for an hour and 47 minutes.  I had some stuff I wanted to learn from you when we were both more level headed so that I could better myself for future relationships and thought it fair to return information you wanted.  We aren't friends.  We don't need to talk.  I don't love you.  I don't miss you.  It's unfortunate that you love and miss me but you're the one that fucked your boss.  If I do ever come back to (state I moved from) I'm not going to look you up, and if I run in to you at the gas station by our parents' houses we aren't exchanging pleasantries.""  

This was in response to an almost two hour phone conversation and a few lengthy and humorous text messages over the next two days.  She confessed her feelings for me still and I realized ""Oh shit, we aren't talking about the stuff I wanted to anymore...I should have cut this off earlier."""
46,"Ah well, good luck to you my dude."
47,"In my case, it happened the other way around"
48,Winning The lotter and quit working

50,it was in reference to religious/caste issues common in India. But since your not in India i don't have any answers. I'm American i can't speak to why Indian men in the UK do or don't do anything.
51,Are you attracted to Indian guys?
52,"I never was, now I am slowly becoming attracted to them but they don’t scream excitement tbh "
53,I've never had one but any time I start regularly seeing someone it just puts me off. The feeling that I HAVE to text or see someone or cook or go somewhere with.

62,Because Malayalees are complex beings and I’m too scared 
63,"I’ll tell you my experience as an islander male - it’s extremely common for us to marry outside our race. Basically, there’s a lot of cultural things I don’t want to carry to my children, I also know (or more accurately assume) she holds the same beliefs as most other islanders - many of which I don’t support. 

Indian culture so far as I know is *very* strong, it could also be - especially if you’re young - that Indian guys see you as someone they’d talk to if they were serious. Basically ‘wife material’ - because before they ever talk to you they assume they already know what you’re like and what you want - they might not be ready for that - whether it’s true or not that might be how they see it, because for me I guarantee that’s how Islander guys see it if they’re with an Islander girl. 

IMO and experience, your best bet is to talk to them - see who they are. "
64,There's your answer. You think guys don't get scared? 
65,Don't leave us hanging. Tell us what services you provided her with!

71,"You can't. And that's unfortunate. But women can't either. It's a two way street and it once again, devolves into a communication thing. In this guy's case though, he would have found out early on enough about the noral issue."
72,Arizona it seems.
73,This ia gonna sound like a weird flex but i dont mean it to. But i had a house built on land that i own. With a woman that loves me enough to think i was worth making another life with ( twice ). I enjoy my job and have fulfilling hobbies. Life has problems sure. But a while back id been playing with my sons all day and my wife and i had just put them to bed. We showered and had great sex. Then just layed in bed together. As i said my life does have problems.  But id feel pretty shitty to pretend im not incredibly lucky.
74,Change things up man! A trip to the adult shop together is a fun way to spice up the relationship. 
75,"I shaved mine because it was hiding my chiseled jawline that I work so hard on. Shaving still sucks, but maintaining a beard can suck too. "

77,I managed to find that repulsive without even having children.
78,Gotta respect the troops 
79,Her not farting.
80,"I can totally relate to these. Especially your point about not admiring her for any particular reason. 

It feels shallow saying it but my ex didn’t do or have any qualities that I found to be overly exceptional. She was the nicest girl with the warmest heart but I felt like she didn’t strive for as much as I needed to. 

I feel like an ass saying it but I think that played a major role in why we didn’t work out.

And it's a double edged sword, because depression kills the libido. And the medicine that helps depression kills it even more.

153,"This is my current relationship. She's caring, beautiful, kind, very intelligent and we have similar mindsets. She's basically the ideal girlfriend and has all the qualities I thought I ever wanted in a partner, both physically and mentally. Not to mention, this girl loves the living hell out of me. Like, she gets emotional when she's talking about me (our mutual friends told me this), and is always patient with me and even when she gets mad she's understanding and calms down as soon as I apologise or explain myself. 

I don't know what she sees in me, and I certainly don't feel like I deserve her, not one bit. I have no idea why I don't feel for her the same way. There's literally no reason I can think of that would justify me not wanting to be with her or care for her the same way. The closest thing would be that it's a long distance relationship and it has been since almost the beginning, although we meet once in a while. 

For some weird reason I hate myself for, I find myself avoiding her, not replying to her texts, not taking her calls and just basically avoiding all contact. This goes on for days, even weeks sometimes. I tell her I'm busy with at work and that's why I can't stay in touch but I know that's bs, and deep down I think she does as well. I have no explanation for why I do this. She seems to be everything I've ever wanted, but at the same time I sometimes even feel a strange dislike for her FOR NO REASON. 

this is eating me up inside. I've been extremely depressed for the last year, although I do an excellent job at hiding it and nobody knows. I feel like I'm a major asshole and I'm so confused. I've tried breaking up with her before but she won't hear of it. She started crying and just wouldn't  let me go. I mean so much to her. I can of course force the relationship to an end but I'm worried it's going to be the biggest mistake of my life. I doubt I'll ever find someone that loves and cares for me unconditionally like her, I don't think I'm special and idk why she does but she does. A part of me tells me I feel this way because it's a long distance relationship and once the distance is closed it'll be better but idk how much I believe that. I think it's also related to very deep  rooted commitment issues that I haven't explored or tried to fix.

I feel lost, confused, selfish and cowardly. I want the best things for her and want her to be happy. Sometimes when we talk I feel like maybe I do love her and I'm going to be glad eventually that I stayed with her. Then once the call is over I start avoiding her for no reason. I can't help it. 

Welp, this was fucking long. Pretty sure nobody is going to read this, but it felt fucking great to type it out. It's all things I've known inside my head but I've never written it out or said it out loud to another soul. Half tempted to delete this but I think I'm going to hit post anyway  "

186,"Work for what you care about and find moral, don't stop working for them when it doesn't feel 'fair'.

Morality is not universal, but it can still have meaning within specific systems. Perhaps most universal is how much you limit the agency of others with your own agency.

Dive deep into logical fallacies. Being aware of them can really help shield you from a lot of bullshit.

You, and everyone else, are not perfectly logical. No matter how certain or lucid you feel, you are not some perfect beacon of logic. If there's an argument and your perfectly logical point isn't convincing people, maybe you're wrong or at least maybe you're communicating it wrong.

Language is imperfect. Words will have different meanings to different people. Someone not understanding isn't their fault, it's just failure to communicate. They can either strive to better understand or you can strive to better explain. The closest you get to fault is giving up.

Relationships of any sort of built at least loosely on cycles of vulnerability, validation, and trust. Someone shares something that shows a level of trust/risk, the other person validates that in some way, and trust is built together. If there's tension in a relationship, someone probably feels invalid. Fair is irrelevant; you either will put in the effort to make it work better or decide it's not worth that effort. Vulnerability is subjective, so one person might have a harder time sharing but that doesn't make what they share less vulnerable."

Now he just wants to sit around and play video games. Gets annoyed if I'm hyper and I feel like any time I want to be close and talk to him, he just thinks about something else and rolls his eyes or grunts so I'll take a hint to leave him alone. I never get his undivided attention unless I practically beg for it and then it's attention he is giving me by force and not love so I still don't get any satisfaction.

231,"Tell that to the couple who has a sick baby, where mom works during baby’s (mercilessly short) naps while being a full time SAHM (caring for every single need of the house) and dad works 60-80 hours per week as he works to transition careers— a trajectory that will take at least two years.  

Wanting to have sex and schedules aligning to make that desire come to fruition are far from the same thing. Not everyone works typical 9-5s where mom and dad have down time together (or has a healthy kid who sleeps, or a support system who can watch them for a night, etc). 

Example: My husband works 8-130, is home at 2 for lunch (which I make. We don’t have the budget to eat out, so I cook every single meal consumed for our family) and family time, then leaves for his real job at 3 until midnight. On the “weekends” he typically has court in the mornings and puts in 8-10 hours at his second job (which he’s trying to transition into full time).

I am up every hour-1.5 hours all night with our baby (I have gotten no more than 5 hours of broken sleep for the last 9 months— 4 is normal). I wake at 5am every morning to get my work started and then get our daughter (at 630 or so), make breakfast, make sure my husband’s clothes are ironed and that he is taken care of before he leaves for the day. During our daughters naps, I work. When my husband is home from work, God willing, our daughter is asleep, and we can squeeze in a quicky. Typically, she isn’t. Then he leaves for work. 

When our daughter finally goes down around 7, I have a few hours to: clean the house, do dishes, do laundry, make sure our pups get quality mom time, meal prep for the next day, shower, and work on MY job. By 11, my daughter has awakened at least twice, so I have soothed her back to sleep each time. If I’m good, I take a shower and crawl into bed around 12– right around the time my husband gets home. We chat a bit. I do my best not to be zombied out from the chronic lack of sleep, and I usually give his some sort of oral/hj. Sometimes I have to stay up later to finish my work, which means I’m up all night with an hour nap or two. On those days I end up napping when our baby naps too. 


To be clear: My husband doesn’t help with her at night because I do not want him to. He’s offered countless times, but because he is a cop, I put his sleep as the most vital thing in our home. If he is tired or distracted at work, he very well could be killed. If he were in a critical incident and exhausted, he may not be able to make the right call, defend himself, etc. So it’s just me running the house rodeo while he works his ass off. 

But outside of weekends when we can actually have an evening together and the weekday quicky? Yeah right. We are doing well if we bang twice per week. Once per week is standard, unfortunately. 

Sex is absolutely a huge priority— but we have a difficult schedule, and it’s a hard season of our life. Responsibilities absolutely do prevent people from making time for sex. And let’s be real, there’s no amount of oral or hj that’s nearly as good as sex— but sometimes it’s the best we can do. Shrug. "

I'm surprised at how generally happy I am. I have good days, I have bad days, I had some really really shitty days last year. But overall it was still the best year I could remember. I have a great wife who is happy and enjoys her job, great cats, I had a great dog, I have a pretty good puppy (she's still a little wild as puppies are), I hate my job but I make more money than I ever had and can go home and mostly forget about it. Now that I'm post wedding and honeymoon I can actually save that money (so I can look at a new car, moving...). My parents are still in decent health thank goodness. My bros are also in a good spot and my folks don't have to worry about us. I have good friends even if I don't see them enough.

Bitterness? Sometimes but not these days. Anger? Occasionally but it's not a background noise. Depression comes and goes. Same with insecurity, but just much much less these days as I feel so comfortable and stable in my relationship. These feelings come and go but I try to focus on the positives and things that make me happy. "

I was sitting in a chair in the living room one morning. My brother woke up later than I did, and when he woke up he sat down in the chair next to me (it was a wide chair). Just then, without saying a word, he farted loudly. It was a sound like ripping fabric.

Suddenly, a white-colored blur darted out from underneath the chair and ran away. Apparently his fart had scared the cat! We looked at each other and started laughing, it was hilarious. 

Recently, during Christmas, our mother made a comment about it. She said, mockingly, ""I like how all y'alls memories are, like, 'Hey, remember that one time when I farted? Heh heh'"" It's true, I guess it's a guy thing, she compares us to Beavis and Butthead all the time. But that one time when he farted and scared the cat was just too perfect."

Ask once you may not get what you want if you ask more than once though then it kind of puts an urgency to it that wasn't there before."

Turns out it was that way because when I was a kid he spent most of the day outside either working somewhere or just being away. So the few times a day that I actually saw him where in the evening/night, there was never really any time for him to be mad at me.

Which made me realize that he really didn't give a shit about maintaining a relationship towards my siblings and I."

If I'm being honest, I don't really know what it means to be happy in general. Yeah sure, I am happy when I do fun stuff with friends, but the moment I'm alone I'm sad again. So I don't really know if that could be classified as being happy."

325,"It's the ultimate struggle of long term relationships. Hell, I think a lot of people get into LTRs specifically to take someone for granted (to stop getting in shape, stop communicating so much, stop trying new things, etc).

It's extremely difficult to not eventually take things for granted. I think we are programmed as humans to do just that. To adapt to our surroundings as the new normal and then try to move on to what is next. "
326,He used to talk to me and we’d do fun things but he now has a love affair with his phone or someone in it and then twist that I have the problem with him being in the phone 99% of the time. And then he will make a point to stay off for like 5 min while stewing there because he’s not on it and making me feel uncomfortable with his silence. Shit is getting old and I feel like a fool sitting there watching with my peripheral vision him on it and texting constantly. It’s no wonder he has no friends and is alone. So fricken close to cutting ties.

332,"Her depression. I never knew it at first but after we starting dating she told me she took pills for depression but she said she was working on getting off them. She told me this after she got mad at me one day. It didn’t bother me and I was glad I could be there for her. I never knew when she eventually got off them, all I know is she wasn’t taking them anymore and she seamed happier. Eventually she left me but it kind of hurts to know that she used me as a “cushion” to rely on and be there for as she got off the pills. I miss her a lot."
333,"Definitely a good sub. 

Buying the larger option is usually better with most things. 

One of the easiest meals I do sometimes is canned chicken with hot sauce. Not BBQ or anything with calories. I have also read somewhere that buying a whole chicken will save you money.

Over 50% of my meals are just salads, but always with meat. Throw some cheese in there and pick a healthy dressing or use sour cream. Keeps it easy and my grocery bill is usually under 60/week.

With beef, depending on what you consider healthy or what you are looking for in your diet I believe the fattier beef is usually cheaper.

Nuts are pretty much expensive all around, peanuts are usually the cheapest.

346,"You guys probably have it set, but I'm an introvert and my ex wanted to see me every day but I really needed my time to myself as well. It really drained me but she couldn't understand it, but I was devoted and didn't understand my needs at the time. It ended after many small fights and me realising we just weren't compatible. I'm not even sure if I can even get back into a relationship after that. It makes me anxious just thinking about that possibly happening again."

349,"Freshman year of college. Told me she broke up with her guy from back home. Actually didn't do that, as I discovered by her writing a lover letter in Microsoft word on my computer. She practically lived in my dorm room at this point. I was mad, but in love, so I forgave her. She gaslighted me and emotionally manipulated me the whole time, making me out to be the bad guy. She hated me hanging out with my friends for a myriad of reasons and made me slowly cut them out of life. Yet i was fine with her and her friends. She made me feel like her savior which felt good, but she would do shit that was like borderline cheating if not outright cheating when she would go home. Eventually I got a little more paranoid and controlling because of her shit. Which was ammo for her to use against me. Eventually we started becoming distant. We both went to our respective homes for summer break, and i went to visit her a few times. Came back to school for Sophomore year and she very distant, which was odd since her dorm room was on the same floor and about 10 doors down from mine. We also made the mistake of signing up for 2 or 3 of the same classes. Eventually I find out she was cheating on me with an exchange student and decided to leave me for him shortly after my 19th bday. So about a year of dating. I was sad and mad, but whatever. I started hanging out with my old friends again who took me back etc... But then she tried saying I was stalking her and suicidal so got campus life and campus police involved. I was of course absolved of everything, but did move to another dorm. All because we lived on the same hall and had many of the same classes. I learned a lot of lesson through negative experiences from that first girlfriend. "

It’s a pretty new relationship and it wouldn’t be right to ask that of somebody. I’m just looking for people that have been in similar situations. I know what I “really” want to do. But it would be nice to hear other people’s experience!

357,Dude yes. Doing household chores is a huge turn on for women. For some reason them seeing you wash dishes or fold laundry gets them all hot and bothered lol
358,"I'd be quite pleased about getting an unsolicited vagina pic! I like vaginas. Sure, there are plenty of more photogenic parts of the body that I'd *rather* see, but of a woman is showing me intimate images of her body, I'm not going to complain!

On the other hand, if it was from a woman whom I was actively unattracted to (e.g. they were very obese, or old enough to be my mother, etc.), I'd be grossed out and want to exit the conversation sooner rather than later. That's very much the exception, rather than the rule, and it's the only context in which it would be ""unwanted"".

Other than that, I fully welcome any women reading this to send me pictures of your vagina. Go for it!"

396,"I’ve certainly experienced a decline with everyone I’ve been with for more than a year. There are lots of factors here - careers, kids, physical health, diminishing attraction, etc. - and you can’t provide a one-size-fits-all solution. 

In my experience I think the decline over time is usually a shared responsibility. You can take some positive steps to reverse it. Here’s a few I use:

* Schedule sex. Saturday night is fuck night, almost no matter what. A few weeks in you start expecting it and your brain and body are primed. A month or two in and you start teasing one another with it throughout the week. These days we sometimes delay sex until the weekend just to drag out the flirting part because it’s so much fun.

* Stay fit and healthy. If you don’t find one another attractive, of course the sex will decline.

* Talk. Seriously, the number of long-term couples who can’t use their fucking words is embarassing to me. Talk to your partner. Tell them what you’re into and what you want.

* Have weird sex. If all you do is missionary and cowgirl you’ll be bored by the fifth date. Have some weird sex. Put stuff in their mouth and up their butt. And if you really, really want to put stuff in butts but they don’t? Maybe you’re not sexually compatible. 

I’m always seeing these dudes on Reddit who are like ‘I want to put it in my wife’s butt but she won’t let me...’ And it’s like: she didn’t want it in her butt in year one, so she probably won’t want it in year twelve. Maybe you should have married a girl who likes it in the butt in the first place?

I’m into year five. I’ve been in other long-term relationships and dated more than a hundred girls before I met my partner and we’re still as horny and filthy now as we were the day we met. 

If your partner isn’t aligned with your sexual desires then you either married the wrong person or your values drifted apart over time. Either way you’re with the wrong person. Sex matters. Intimacy matters.

Men: stop marrying the first girl you fuck. Date girls who are creative, enthusiastic and like weird sex. Is it a guarantee you’ll have a healthy sex life forever? No, but you’ll have better odds than if you had married a person who was as cold as a starfish on date three."
397,I miss the flirtation.  I miss the sexual urgency after having had time away.  I miss the discovery.   Some of this is probably just a function of a relationship growing and not in any way an indication of regret or unhappiness.  Just items that I miss.
398,"I had a boyfriend that the only time he would try to snuggle me was when he wanted sex. The only time he would touch me is when he wanted it to become sex. So I avoided it if I wasnt in the mood. Touching could never just be a intimate bond or cuddle, feeling that every time he touched me I had to have sex gave me anxiety.

I am currently with my soul mate that we express the way we feel and truley respect it. If he comes in the bed and is rubbing on me and I tell him I dont want to have sex he says ok and continues to just rub me with no expectation, instead of stopping everything! I no longer feel like i have to give sex to just be loved."

468,What do you feel has worked for you as a couple to achieve 15 years of bliss?
469,"I normally do. During college I tried my best to really understand what lifestyle would really make me happy, and I purposefully worked to build a lifestyle that suits me.  This can be difficult, since the ""normal"" life path that is laid out for us growing up might not work for a lot of people.   


If I had followed the ""normal"" life path, I would have grabbed the highest paid job I could, bought the biggest house I could, and married the first woman I could following the advice I had received that the best way to be a husband is to be a total yes man.  


But what if that job makes you miserable? But you need the money to pay for that big house that you now realize you didn't need? What if you just got married out of a sense of ""this is the best I can do"", and then yes manned yourself into life choices that you didn't really want in the futile hope that your agreeableness would make your wife love you? This is the reality that lots of men walk into.  


 Instead of doing this, really ask yourself what you want out of life, and then figure out how to get it. Question your previous assumptions about how life ""should be"". More money is nice, but is there a trade off in terms of time, stress, and your overall enjoyment? You'll spend a good portion of your life at work, so it's worth it to have a job you don't hate.  I hear lots of women say that they want a man who ""challenges them"". This is the exact opposite of the advice I had received from the men in my life! I'm not a woman expert, but I no longer share my previous relationship beliefs, and I'm thankful that I never got hitched while I thought being a doormat = being a good husband.

&amp;#x200B;

So in summary, many people are miserable because they follow a life path that makes them so. Question your life path, and formulate one for yourself that makes you happy!"

He probably didn't want to hear anymore about my family drama either.

I would get to the point where I didn't know what to talk about that day because I didn't want to bring up my same old same old again. In the beginning it's interesting because it's new and fresh. Maybe that's part of why he stopped writing notes?

502,"This is a long, long time ago, but I learned that men don't often get compliments about their looks or other ""set"" qualities, instead getting complimented on achievements or performance more often (if they get complimented at all). I always enjoyed compliments about what I did/achieved a lot more than compliments about my appearance, but r/askmen made me realise that was just because I got more compliments about my appearance, and from a very young age. I read that somewhere after I broke it off with my ex and ever since getting together with my current BF, I make it a point to compliment him both on achievements, as well as on his appearance. I regularly tell him he's hot, certain pants look verrrry good on him, as well as hugely respecting him and expressing that for him building his own walls inside his studio apartment. I never get much of a reaction in the moment, but he'll later refer to certain pants as ""the ones you like my ass in"" etc, which tells me it's definitely acknowledged and probably highly appreciated. "
503,"I get that, I do. I probably got complacent  too in certain areas of the relationship. I'll keep this in mind for the next relationship! I've learned a lot from hanging around /r/askmen so I know just straight up asking for what I want is the way to go :)"
504,"Older women are in my opinion, much more likely to belittle/not empathize with the problems or their younger SO's. Other older women i've met have said ""oh you're young, we probably don't want the same things."" or in the case below, just don't really see past their bubble.

I recently dated this girl I met at my 23rd birthday party and she was 25. There were obvious differences. She was much more mature than I was to an annoying fault. Her super rich grandfather paid for her Ivy league education and grad school. She also was very set in her ways/wasn't open to hearing opinions that strayed from her world views/personal code.

Example being travel. I, being young and not from a very wealthy family/have a good amount of student debt, haven't been able to travel internationally as much as her. I told her i want to travel but i needed to save money and pay for things first before i can spend thousands on an international trip. She told me that you can always save/i know people with student loans who travel/you don't owe your family anything and that i should travel because it's super important. For some reason, feeling like i had to rationalize my views on travel, we argued about me having not left the country ever.

I stopped seeing her shortly after.

You can google average wedding cost for your area based on your wedding size, so first step would probably be nailing down the guest list as that will affect where you can even look to hold all the people.  For venues, be careful about some that have some exclusive vendors that they use.  Those can get pricey if you have limited options to shop around.  Ask about those as well as capacity a venue can hold.  For costs savings, we're doing sheet cakes from a store and a bakery just for the sweetheart cake.  Last bit of advice would be wedding expos.

518,"I dont really know how to define cheap. Like ground beef is cheeper than  filet mignon bision. 
So take that with what you will.

For health just as a generic start, i would say start paleo. Then find out if you can eat grains, rice,  and legumes.  If you can eat something and for the most part you dont feel sick, get a rash, or shit your pants in the next hour. You should be ok for this  generic broad approach 

Very basic approach here. Stay on the perimeter of the store. Stay away from
Most boxed foods.  Frozen bags of veggies are fine for this ,stuff like tuna, or chicken in a can. 

Look for deals, like meats that are on sale. Buy one get one free.  Ground beef is cheap, petite  sirloins are cheap where iam at. There usually buy one get 1 free at my store. So i can get like 2.5lbs for like 25 bucks.

Eggs  are cheap. Buy roasted chicken from the market all ready cooked. Thats like 7-10bucks and that can be a couple of meals.  You could buy frozen chickens and roast them your self.

Produce is cheap if you buy whats in season and or stick to veggies.   Bag potato’s , onions, carrots, and green bell peppers.

Fruits get costly like berries. Stick with apples and bananas depending on your area. 

You are just going to have to gain some knowledge like on here and maybe read a book. 
Like mushrooms are great but white is cheaper than the more exotic ones. Bags of rice are fairly cheap. 

Learn how to cook. Tasty and binging with babish on youtube are my fav. You can get some good ideas and learn how to cook.  Learn how to take cheap cuts of beef like flank steak and make it rad as fuck. 

Listen to some podcast like barbell shrugged, mark bells power project , or like old robb wolf paleo solution.   Good luck dude. "

Of course a sex shop and sex too."

526,"Ahh...well, *Why* is she your only friend?

If you keep super weird and she keeps similar hours, then she's going to be one of a very few people who you even have access to. That's reasonable.

If it's because you both moved to a new country where neither of you knows anyone or speaks the language...that also makes sense.

If she's so abrasive that people won't hang out with her and you by proxy, it's a problem. If every time you have a social opportunity, she has some sort of a meltdown or emergency, it's a problem.

And if she has forbidden you from socializing or makes it difficult for you to do, it's a huge problem.

So..why is she your only friend? When was the last time you tried to make friends with someone? What happened? And what happened to all your former friends?

Long distance was so stretching but our relationship was amazing when we finally got to live in the same town because communication had been all we had for a year so we knew how to discuss things with each other. 
Also there was a time at the beginning of our engagement where we both low key panicked and wondered if we really weren’t compatible for marriage.

It could be a lot of things, but in the end you may have to accept that you may not know.  Attraction is a fickle thing and it can come and go in a splash.  I've experienced something very similar to this, and I never knew why she just stopped talking to me, but I know that it happens.  

Things that come to mind would be:

1. He is legitimately busy with other things.

2. He has something going on in his life that he doesn't want you in on, but is distracting from a possible romantic relationship.

3. I hate to say this, but he may just wanted to have sex with you and was courteous enough to also not want to ruin your xmas. 

4. I also hate to say this, but time away from you changed his interest.

5. ^^ he might have run into someone else.

6. ^^ he decided he didn't want a girlfriend.

Some men are in it for the pursuit, and once they've ""got it"" they lose interest.  I hope it all turns out positively for you, because it sounds like you really like this guy.  "
550,"It totally depends.

An I attracted to her? Is she attracted to me or just looking for attention? Have we met or spoken before? Is she some random woman?

If it's a girl I know and I'm attracted to her, go right ahead. If it's a total stranger that I've never met or barely spoken to, it would be weird. If it's someone I know and am not attracted to then it's certainly unwelcome.

Personally I don't send dick pics for any reason, even on request. My junk doesn't need to be on the internet and if she wants to see it so bad then we can just fuck instead."

If he’s somewhere in the middle, you’ll want to mix the two

I feel you on the strife part. Seems like there a million things wrong about my body physically that cause me to not enjoy my time in the present. However, it’s not like I have cancer and even though there are definitely things that can improve, I’m learning slowly to accept the negatives and not focus on them.

I think the main thing I’ve gotten away from my thinking over the past few weeks is that listen, I’m going to live for X amount of years. During that time I can spend it either constantly worried about the shitty things such as my insecurities, problems with the world, my death, etc.. or I can choose to focus on the things that make me happy.

My ex is a good example. She wasn't emotionally stable, lied to me about her mental health/hid some significant mental illnesses, and wasn't doing enough, if anything, to manage her mental health.

This led to her acting out a lot. Emotional breakdowns over minor stuff or stuff that legit hadn't actually happened. Irrational jealousy. Retroactive jealousy. Major insecurity, which led her to try and control my social life, friend groups, masturbation habits. A lot of the stuff she had a problem with was stuff she also did, like have opposite gender friends or spend time alone with them.

Every time she acted out or tried to set restrictions on me, I got less interested...the loss of interest correlated with how egregious her misstep was.

When she threatened to run away and then got upset when I didn't take her seriously? I was annoyed and a bit less interested.

When she tried to have an argument with me about listening to a KFC sales pitch, I was annoyed and even less interested.

When she accused me of cheating and demanded I text her any time I was making social plans because I had the gall to have dinner with a mutual female friend, I was pretty massively put off and decided that if she could act right, she could stick around, but her next misstep was her last. It didn't help that she had male friends she spent time with, and I never minded. Hypocrisy.

And when she, despite having had 3 other actual sexual partners when we started dating (we were poly), flipped out because I watch porn and insisted she got input in how I masturbate because we were dating, I immediately lost ALL interest in her and the relationship. The moment she started freaking out was the moment I just didn't care how she felt anymore. Everything else form her was just noise at that point."

Right on the money. My wife and I have been married for 20 years. We’ve gone through just every bad thing you can imagine. 

....but we persevered through it, and the love is deeper than I ever dreamed love could be. 

It’s not that hot and heavy infatuation like you have in the beginning. It’s a gratitude that despite the trials we’ve had to endure, we’ve made it through. 

The trials are a test. Make it through and the love grows deeper. If you don’t make it through, quit, and try again with someone new, you only get to experience the temporary infatuation type of love. "

590,How ugly is the vagina though? I’m not saying I would act on it in any way; I just wouldn’t be crazy upset. I think it would be novel. Men don’t really get random nudes like women do. I imagine women be upset nearly as much if it was something that never really happened. They generally enjoy a penis; it’s just the frequency in which they get sent them. I could be wrong though; maybe men are just bigger perverts.

Men age like wine, women age like milk.

A 30+ man can easily score &lt;30 women. At least I can, and I’m not even a looker. It’s like I’m growing older but they stay the same age.

&gt;	your testosterone level is lower so you are less into risk taking

What has that to do with anything?

&gt;	everyone begins to treat you with disrespect if you havent achieved the milestones that you should've.

1.	They have always treated me like shit because I’m a man anyway, nothing has changed.
2.	Fuck them, IDGAF.

&gt;	having a person stand behind you and got your back is great

They say behind every successful man stands a woman. That’s because they’re gold diggers who don’t go for broke guys. She wasn’t there when he was broke, she just showed up one day when he had already crossed the finish line.

&gt;	having a son is great too.

There are better ways to get that if that’s important. Today you can even clone yourself if the price is right. Then you can have a son that’s not diluted with thot genes and come with a bunch of child support and paternity squabbles.

&gt;	situations where you don't lock in that great person you met in your 20s

Why? Is there some law that says I can only pair up with someone my own age? I’m fucking 18 year olds left and right, if any of them have more personality than a goldfish, then there’s nothing stopping me from going long term, is it?

&gt;	basically you gotta move to the next stage by then or you'll be unhappy.

Why? There’s no reason to move on to any stage unless you want to. There’s no reason marriage needs to be the next stage. There’s no reason not marrying should make you unhappy. Not if you’re a man at least."

I really, honestly, do not need to be revved up anymore than I already am. Unlike your friend, I am the definition of low maintenance - however it seems to bite me in the ass because I feel like I set the bar too low that my partner simply doesn't try. 

&gt; offer your bf or husband a completely spontaneous and unrequested bj or quickie, requiring no planning or prior effort on his part. You will NEVER get turned down.

I have done this, and it's true they don't turn it down, however I want to get off sometimes too. I have given several BJ's a week, without expecting immediate return (because I know it's nice to sometimes enjoy without obligation) and apparently that isn't enough to get them revved up enough to return the favour.


I never had these problems in my 20s - I haven't gained weight or anything else, I still get IDed at bars etc. Furthermore, several of my friends are struggling to get their husbands to fuck them. It really seems to me that most men in this age range just don't have the testosterone that they once had. "

It will vary by industry or specialty, but the basic idea is that you have an understanding of all the moving parts to reach the goal and help keep a project on track.

Speaking for myself, I work for an industrial supplier handling customer ecommerce integrations.

My sister and I didn't have the best of relationships. I was a mean older brother who picked on and lashed out at my sister a lot growing up. Despite that, we ended up reconnecting through a mutual love for anime. She jokingly gave me the title of Oni which meant demon (opposed to Onii which meant brother). We never truly became close though.

Fast forward to about a year after our mother passed away, I was having a crisis of sorts and went to my sister for advice. I was considering moving in with my maternal grandmother whom my late mom did not get along with and wouldn't speak to up until death. My dad didn't even allow her to come and bury her child. Anyways, my sister was confused and a little apprehensive at first, but eventually she dropped something along the lines of,

""Bro, you are a good person and in control of your own life. Dad will understand and Mom couldn't ever hate you. Do what you think is right; It probably will be the right choice.""

I don't think that expecting your partner to be able to communicate their feelings is too high of an expectation, especially when it comes at a cost to you and your connection. My SO and I talk about our feelings quite frequently, and I expect that if he is upset that he communicates that with me in a healthy way (not yelling, no silent treatment, naming his emotions, clear expectations, etc.).

As I was getting back into my car, and had one foot still out the door, I heard something that sounded like a growl then a sharp pain on my leg.

I quickly thrashed my leg back and forth, once it released I got out to see what it was. Believe it or not, there was a damn dragon underneath my car attacking my leg. Not really, but it was a coyote. It started charging me, and before I knew what was happening I strangled that coyote and was holding it's limp body in my arms. 

A moment later I heard something else from underneath the car. I went to check and what I found was the young pup that it's mother was just trying to protect. Very sad situation.

see, this is where you need to toughen up and let a man know exactly what you are wanting. sometimes women tend to not be 100% honest when it comes to their feelings thus misleading the man. which it kind of seems like you are doing in an inadvertent way. if you just want to fuck let it be know. 9.9 times out of 10 a man wont turn down pussy. just be upfront. he will appreciate knowing your true intentions. 

also, if you don't really want to go to restaurants and on dates, then don't put that option out there like you said you did. he took the restaurant/date rout so right there you just mislead him and yourself. you opened the door by offering an option that you truly are not looking for maybe because you are trying to be nice. if thats the case. stop being nice in that regard. just let it be known what you truly want."

744,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

I've only been on two Tinder dates with one girl so I have very limited experience. Dating apps haven't been a great success to me. I was 23 at the time and she was 19. The first date was kinda lame but I had a great time. We went out for lunch. Decided to walk around at the mall. Decided to invite her over for Wrestlemania with my roommate and friends. Stayed until it ended and I walked her to her car. She kissed me which surprised me.

We set another date up a few weekends later and decided to buy food and cook it back at my place. She's vegan so she let me try her food options and I just had some salmon. We watched YouTube videos until I just leaned into kiss her. Next thing I knew we were naked and she blew me and she stayed the night. No sex. I didn't want to push anything. She just did it without me asking. She pretty much ghosted me a few weeks after that. Lol.

TL;DR: not super relevant story about my only Tinder dates but leads up to a simple conclusion. 

I never expect sex at any point while dating. I'm very pinpoint on consent and need a definitive ""yes, let's have sex"" from her. I'm not really into hookups. I don't think I'm really made for it. I try for relationships. But I doubt I'd ever say no to anything sexual if I find the girl attractive. "
745,"Exactly. That holier-than-thou attitude was too much for me. She would make her preferences/worldviews known, and if i had any opinion or opposition that didn't align with hers than i wouldn't hear the end of it. She worked in social work, so when i voiced slight opposition to some programs or some treatment of homeless, she would go ""you're literally saying this to someone whose life work is this."" Or when it was travel it was ""i'm a person who makes travel one of their greatest priorities."" Like i couldn't empathize with the desire to travel because i hadn't done a great deal. I thought it was an age thing, but some of my best friends (guys) are 25 and we get along great. 

Some women just stick to their roots because they've never had any reason to uproot them."

749,Sounds like you either need lube or more foreplay to get her wet enough. 
750,"INITIATE!!!

As a man who has been married for over 15 years, I cannot reiterate that enough. Even when I was single and ""dating"" the biggest turn off was when sex felt like pulling teeth. Meaning, I had to do all of the moves to ""get her in the mood"". Some men, myself included, see it as a major turn on if the woman takes control and makes moves to get into your pants. When my wife does that, it's a major bonus and it almost always means great sex. 

"
751,"You'd think it's obvious. But if you ask your guy friends I'm sure most of them could tell you a story about missing something obvious with a girl.

I think you need to nudge him a bit. Drinks, not dinner. Get up in his space a bit. If he won't kiss you then he never will."
752,"Honestly I don't get this. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been upset enough to cry in the last 8 years of my relationship and I never have felt like I should hide that. I get concealing that in a *new* relationship or during the dating period but... why would I want to be in a relationship where I felt like I needed to hide my feelings? That sounds awful. Maybe I'm just skewed because I've been with my gf for so long but idk if expressing feelings as a man is a rational thing to fear. In fact if a girl is going to bail because you cried about something (dog dying, getting fired, etc) then she can go fuck herself. You're better off. Thats like getting dumped by a cheater. It may suck for a minute but you'll be better off."

And there's going to be men who aren't going to open up, and that's just not your preference.

One time I had a gay guy ask if I wanted to go on vacation with him to a nude beach (I think I even wrote a post about it somewhere), this was after him sending me pictures of him traveling unsolicited and practically demanding me to send him pictures. He got pretty salty when I declined his invitation. He was fully aware I was straight.

Another couple occasions while travelling, I had some guys try to invite me back to their hotel room. One even promised he woudn’t touch me while we were sleeping. In these instances, again, they knew I was straight.

I can’t fully comprehend that way of thinking, maybe they think I’m in the closet and they’ll be the guy who “turns” me, or maybe it’s the same logic as a guy who doesn’t take no for an answer when a girl rejects him."
794,"My partner couldn't open up until \~this past year, after a ton of (individual and couple's) therapy. I'm not ignorant of the ways in which the patriarchy/society is toxic to men and often emotionally isolates them. That doesn't mean that the answer is to accept that men can't/won't/shouldn't work on expressing themselves in a healthy way. It's less about preference here (I'm not saying that my partner wants to watch romcoms and cry together, or that I would/n't prefer that) and more about practicality: men do have feelings, which can be hurt, and the ability to deal with that in a productive/healthy manner is what's at stake here. Expecting your partner to have that capacity is not an unreasonable expectation, even if it requires some re-learning. Plenty of women also don't handle their emotions in the best way, doesn't mean their partner should stop expecting them to."

There was a comment the other time about how a guy would generally imagine what an attractive woman’s boobs would look like when he passed her on the street, and I thought that couldn’t be right... but it was upvoted quite a bit.

That was... quite a revelation.

Also that there really is a widespread belief that women end up losing their attraction for men who show their emotions. I’m not in a position to say if it’s true or if it isn’t, as there are so many nuances to “showing emotions” and a vast difference between emotional vulnerability and using your partner as a crutch or an emotional dump. And we’re all just finding our way and some people, men and women, still have a very archaic notion of what it is to be a man. And it’s sad that many men feel the need to go to the extreme end and not show any sadness because they’ve been burnt by that. 

It’s made me doubly determined to parent my kid in a way that doesn’t force him to repress his emotions... But I also wonder if the world would’ve changed enough by the time he’s an adult and if he might be deemed too soft or emotional for a guy."

So definitely, just 'cause we don't acknowledge it doesn't mean it's not appreciated\~"
810,"One of the best ways--if you have the climate/space/time--is to grow a small garden.

Kale ... (the tongue in cheek-super food) is pretty easy to grow. Half a dozen pots could keep you pretty well fed. I say the (super-food) thing, as there's a cult following around Kale. Kale is a tall upright plant that grows pretty large leaves that are good in soup. There are different varieties some of which grow leaves larger than a dinner plate. They have different tastes, different textures, but continue to grow, if you just cut off the lower leaves leaving upper leaves to nurture the plant. After some combination of age, heat, etc, the plant grows a seed head, and it's done. You wait for the seed head to dry, you collect the seeds in envelopes to share with friends, and you're in the Kale cult.

So with one or two Kale leaves, a ramen pack, and some leftover chicken, pour a whisked egg on that, you can do pretty well nutrition and money wise.

Other easy greens are mustard greens, turnip tops, beet tops. You could scatter some seeds of these things in a vacant lot right about now, and have a boat-load of greens come spring time.

I usually grab one or two of each kind of leaf for my soup. You could even grab a turnip or beet to slice up in your soup. Pretty soon, my soup is more than I can eat, and I can pack down a lot.

A few years ago, I went to a really large Asian market with a Vietnamese friend, and he advised me on sauces to add to ramen. I always toss out the salt packet of the ramen and add sauces I buy at Asian markets.

Other easy garden things are lettuce, if you buy a package of seeds, only plant 1/4 and wait two weeks plant another 1/4, etc. Think about buying the variety package, again, save the seeds."

Not really.  Puritan women could petition for divorce from their husbands, which was absolutely radical at the time - and it could be done for no reason other than failure or unwillingness to sexually satisfy.

In addition, the more communal nature of the family in the agrarian society that was Puritan Massachusetts caused blurring of lines as far as who did what.  Women could and would work in the fields, men could and would cook and keep the house."
814,"I'm sorry, but no. After a lifetime of being invited over, where 'watch a movie' *literally* only ever meant watching a movie as friends, I'm not gonna assume that there's a double meaning behind a woman's words. I'm going to take your words at face value --and so will a lot of men. "

816,"That's my whole point, the ""statistical guarantee"" does not matter, because it does not translate into a ""personal guarantee"".

Yet - and I don't know how much it has to do with the fact that the women who speak out about that do seek those traits or men who have them attribute their ""success"" (highly subjective) to it - it is heavily implied that you must do/be X, Y or Z before even having a chance, which is not true, and also that your chances with an undefined crowd of women skyrocket so much you're basically guaranteed to get a match. 

I'm not saying it shouldn't matter how much you take care of your mind and body, but it oversimplifies relationships so much and is so shallow, I just can't stand it. Relationships just never worked for me that way. Hookups might, but come the fuck on.

They know that it's much harder for you to leave them when your finances, house, kids, and for some folks religion bind them to you.
   If your girlfriend decides to stop fucking you for example you can voice your displeasure and drop her if she decides shes not gonna change. Your wife on the other hand can dole out sex to get her way and unless you want to cheat or experience the rape of divorce court your choices are limited. 
  Now I know what your thinking,  not all women are like that, and it could never happen to you, you guys are different. And I'll just give you a wink say ""ok"" and point you at the lifetime divorce statistics,  between 40 and 50 percent of marriages depending on your demographic end in divorce.... and those are just the actual divorces,  not the droves and droves of poor bastards who want one but cant for financial or other reasons.

828,I already have someone who'd cuddle me for free. But I'd gladly accept to be paid to cuddle with someone.
829,"&gt; That doesn't mean that the answer is to accept that men can't/won't/shouldn't work on expressing themselves in a healthy way.

Just to be clear I wasn't trying to say that at all.  It's one thing to be empathetic towards the fact that some things don't come naturally.  But no one should ever feel like they *have* to accept (what they view as) negative qualities in their partners.  If being closed off emotionally is something you can't accept in a partner then you should feel no guilt over not continuing that relationship.  Ultimately a person who can't or won't change in that respect will be better off finding a different partner.  And meanwhile I think it's important for all of us to push towards positive messaging on men and their emotions.  I do think society's views of men and emotions are changing, but it's a slow and frustrating process, and men still get a lot of mixed messages on the subject."

838,"In high school I found out about that when I get I was sitting next to did it.  He was not having fun.  Still hasn't happened to me, so maybe some guys just have really low hanging balls."
839,Oscar the grouch has been inside his girl for years.
840,"My worst experience on 2xchromozones - talking about some men in my religion who sexually assault women and get away with it, with other men brushing it under the rug and such.

Now this is a legitimate thing that unfortunately happens in some areas and it’s completely shitty. Need to make that 100% clear.

Some guy comments “hey I’m part of this religion too and that behaviour is really shitty, makes me angry that it happens, and it goes agasint established guidelines this religion has set.”

So for the first time and so far only time in my life, I decide to buy gold for a comment. I believe in my religion, I’m aware that shitty things can happen in it and want to highlight that they aren’t supposed to and that there are guys in our religion who are opposed to this behaviour.

I check on the comment I gilded a few hours later, and it’s deleted."
841,"Maybe this has already been said, but I learned or rather realized the lack physical touch men receive - particularly when they are not in a relationship. I’ve made it more of a point to hug my male friends when I see them. "
842,I agree with this completely. The first three months are an emotional rollercoaster and none of this situation surprises me.
843,"On paper, it sounds like a great idea. Cuddling has been shown to decrease stress, blood pressure, and increase oxytocin. I guess it varies from human to human with things such as catching feelings or making it awkward even though it's strictly business. If it helps, it helps!"
844,"The very best dates I've been on have been where we both pay for things together, either splitting bills or buying each other drinks. The pinnacle was when she said she was going to choose what we did next time. It's so rare and so nice to have someone else take that lead every now and then."
845,"Not a women , but shoutout to the fine ladies that can play video games. "
846,"Inexperienced girls sound great on paper, ""Oh cool, I got  to pop her cherry!"" but in reality can be work in the long run. When I was dating, I made it a point to never date virgins because I didn't want to ruin them. Not to say that I'm the greatest sex they would ever have and so on. But in that I wasn't really looking for marriage. Plus I had kids from a previous marriage and had no intentions of having anymore as I had a vasectomy. 

Experienced women, especially divorcees, I could relate with better. "
847,"Fair enough, I wouldn't date that person either.  I don't, however, think that intelligence is a linear skill and that just because someone doesn't have an analytical mind or a good memory that they don't have value as a person.  They may, however, not be the right person for me."
848,"I avoided debt by working a federal job through school. They paid off almost all of my student loans, I was only left with ~5k student loan debt when I graduated."
849,"Plenty of people can afford insurances. I only pay about $70/month for health insurance because my job. Jobs that provide/contribute to health insurance aren't this myth that Reddit likes to believe.

That said, I don't have the mentality that a man must be the provider! My girlfriend actually makes more than I do.

Currently renting an apartment but I'd like to own a house or maybe a condo within 5 years because I'd like some sort of asset and equity, rather than constantly throwing money towards rent."
850,"There is a lot of variation in testicular size and scrotal length out there, it turns out. I'm with you, there's no fucking way this could happen to me and I'm glad it's so!"
851,"That's definitely one way to go with it. Me, I'd play with my dogs all day. "
852,"Kf it was available in my town, Id schedule one session every other week. This is literally the thing that I need. 

The one caveat is that she acts like she wants it too. Doesnt matter if its an act for cash, but if Im not desired, its only half ghe equation..."
853,"""How come you don't want me to hang out with you?""

""So you want me to leave you alone?""

""What did I say?""

855,I'd say a huge part of that would be how you dress/present yourself. But honestly maybe try actually chatting up men too ans not just waiting for men to chat up you instead. But it is true most men do see this to be the case with women. 
856,"&gt; I think that is obvious. 

To you and Captain Obvious, yes. But some guys need to be handheld. "
857,"3.8 GPA, studied biochemistry and molecular biology. I work in environmental toxicology designing research projects and developing reports and other such thrilling activities.

(I wouldn’t normally add my answer here but I really like this thread, so much stuff here I’ve never heard of it)"
858,"Godspeed my friend. It sucks but we will get better. Exercise has saved me and Ive grow stronger in the last 10 years but we both know that sometimes thats not enough and you just have to ride out the storm.

 If you're anything like me your sense of self worth was shattered. I am better but only so much. Outwardly I'm the fun, lovable strong guy and while that is who I am noone sees that I'm deeply broken inside. Constantly fearing I'm one missed step from everything collapsing. 

We will make it. Its nice to know I'm not alone in this. "
859,I can imagine. Getting banned from that sub was one of the best things that happened to me. So many conversations that in real life would have been perfectly reasonable turned very crazy very fast on that sub.
860,"I'm not sure I'd class as nerdy/geeky, depends on what interests class as that, but I'm pretty up front about myself if anyone asks, and I'm definitely not a religious, military, gym bro or guns and beer kind of guy, although I do like having a drink and do go to the gym "
861,[removed]
862,I constantly remind myself this every time. It's really easy to slip into this once your relationship gets comfortable enough. 
863,"Based on one of me ex's, her issue was definitely more what other girls thought of her rather than what other guys or myself thought. I don't know if this is across the board or not though."
864,"&gt; One of which has been caught making false rape allegations twice now.

I mean, yeah. I had my life destroyed by a woman, and it was as bad as you can imagine. But she didn't do that because she was a woman, but because she was a shitty human being.

That's why reading that sub was so dangerous for me, because it's all about gender..."
865,Who's Brian?
866,"Well I had it at birth. But I just had to do it for a 2nd time (first at birth) for my 7 year old. Didn't heal correctly or whatever, allegedly fairly common. My little dude was begging me to do things he wasn't supposed to after about 2 days. "
867,Daaaamn that comment you linked was... Damn. 
868,"West Virginia shoutout! How long did you guys give each other space, and how did you get closer together if you don't mind my asking?"
869,"I don't know what you'd call wake-up dirty, but ""active"" is probably not the word:)"
870,"Sex

Nah seriously, I'd want them to show me around, maybe take me to a few of their favourite local places? It all kind of depends how long he/I am visiting "
871,"Coming from a previous relationship where I treated her like a Queen all the while being treated like a peasant.

Safe to say I’ve never been happier. Clarify, that I do not rely on my current girlfriend for my happiness as that’s a dangerous game to play. She’s just shown me what a real, genuine, and loving relationship should be. "
872,"• Men want to get hyped up by their male friends, just like how women hype eachother up and it being seen as something natural, not sarcastic or whatsoever.

""Brooo, that shirt looks amazing on you! It makes you look stronger! Yooo, my buff bro!""
""Those are some very flattering shoes, my brother.""
""Yeah, rocking those glasses!""

• Men want validation, words of love and  encouragement just like any other person. The fact that they are men does not mean that they aren't sensitive.

In fact, men are pretty sensitive.."
873,"The top answer should be ""Its ok to ask him out"""
874,solid. yup.
875,No problem lol! And thanks:) I hope so too.
876,why is this not on TOP?
877,"I have two siblings with children, and the coolest thing is watching them interact.

Seeing them teaching their children how to navigate this world, seeing what they have taken from our parents, and what they have chosen to leave behind in the previous generation fills my heart with so much joy"
878,"This reality you speak of is based on perspective. Currently, I don't personally know anyone who can't afford insurance, or doesn't have a job, or isn't making something of themselves in life and I'm at the very edge of southern Appalachia. I also don't know anyone who has these values as some type of previously indoctrinated set of goals. People want their own cars because it's nice to have. Same with a house. Some people want kids because they want to be parents. It's not that deep. 

The ""craze"" for this has been a general lifestyle for, idk, 100 years now or so? As soon as economies took off and private parties could invest. And the whole American Family™ business was cold war era propaganda, but it wasn't really any different to begin with, previously or post. They just capitalized on what people were already doing. 

And for myself, if I'm drawing social security, I'm doing something wrong. You'd be surprised how many people feel the same regardless of age. I can secure my future and retirement on my own accord without relying on the government. That's a well taken-for-granted opportunity.  Hell, my father is looking at two million in retirement and he never made life harder for himself by investing in that. "
879,"blamethemeta, your flair! Woof!"
880,What stops you or your SO? 
881,"&gt;That men don't pay as much attention to a woman's appearance. We spend do much time primping and spending hours in front of a mirror and it doesn't really matter

This realisation could literally change the world. Entire industried would deflate massively, womens self worth would change, the list is endless. If only we could somehow convey this to all the ladies out there the world would be a better place"
