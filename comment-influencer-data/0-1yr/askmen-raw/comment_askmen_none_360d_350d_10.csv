0,My friend had a sugar mom for a few months. She took him on vacation to London and gave him chlamydia. He stopped seeing her.
1,Just let it wither and die like the rest of us
2,"Very different.  I was a trouble maker. A line tester and a procrastinator.  I was always intelligent and did well on projects, exams and standardized tests....but always did the very least I had to in class.

My son is a rule following  honor student that knew what he wanted to do as a career when he was in 7th grade and just started his Freshman year in college pursuing his degree in that field. 

My wife and I find it hard to be *more* proud of him (and his sister).




****** Update******* I am shocked and humbled  by all the responses  to this post.  I sincerely never thought it would garner  this type of response.  Thank you all very much."

4,"She paid my college fee for fucking her.
"
5,"There’s hope and life after divorce.

My ex-wife was the one who had a mid-life crisis and an affair and left, leaving me with the kids.  It was the darkest time of my life by far.  I divorced her, and I’m now happily remarried.

I can tell you this: you won’t find any good answers to the question “why?”  Your ex leaving probably has very little to do with you.  And you are not to blame.

However, I did take a hard look at myself.  I did make a few mistakes, although I know I wasn’t to blame for my ex leaving.  But I took the time after she left to make myself better.  And even to forgive her, as much as I could (not for her sake, but for mine, so it wouldn’t consume me).  And I am trying my best to get my second marriage right, and not make the same mistakes I did before."
6,"We spend lots of time berating boys and men for toxic masculinity.

We don't spend time talking about what healthy masculinity looks like."
7,How generous of her
8,"It works about 30% of the time for me which is much better odds than any other approach
"
9,Sexual abuse done to boys.
10,"I saw this girl at a bar who manages a diner near me and always gave me my breakfast (I've since moved). I was always attracted to her. We talked for a bit at the bar, had a couple of shots, and she went to use the bathroom.

I realized I ran out of things to say. I really just wanted to have sex with her.

So when she came back I basically said ""Well I've run out of things to talk about, so I'm either going to go home alone now or you're coming with me.""

Surprised myself. But I had just turned thirty and I guess I was running out of fucks to give.

She blushed and we had sex and were together for about 4 months until I moved to Asia.

"
11,"She said ""I'm not looking to date anyone right now but I really like you so let's just be friends"" and then proceeded to date my close friend. Then a year later it happened again with a different woman and a different friend. 

I still think it's the best way to do things, even though it's never worked for me (fuck, that is actually true, what a shitty thing to realise). Honesty at least speeds shit up and I don't feel like a mewling coward or manipulative bastard."
12,The education gap is kinda a big deal. I work in education and people get very upset if it gets mentioned. Very few in the field are willing to even acknowledge it. 
13,"I like to put it under her pillow, stretched out.

I've tried every variation possible, and it's the best I could come up with after all these years. "
14,"I had one for a while. She was actually quite good- looking in her late 50s, especially her body (yay plastic surgery), and we had a grand time. Went on vacation a few times to places I couldn't/wouldn't have afforded ($1000/night hotels and such), and in the end she even invited me to stay with her while I'd be pursuing an advanced degree. We actually got along nicely and I had woken up quite the libido in her (her words).

Why it had to end you might ask. I found her lifestyle *exhausting*. Every time we spoke, she had some problems with a contractor, or her boat, or one of her properties, or her new car, or her antique car, or... just an hour of complaints every other day. She was also quite conceited: she had a law degree and is a published author, only .. she never practiced law at all, and was only published because she gave large sums to editors and authors. I went to a publishing event and it was really uncomfortable how people seemingly didn't want to deal with her but had to. All the money she had/has was inherited, she never worked as far as I could tell, yet she deemed herself accomplished.

There's more such as her unhealthy bond with her daughter (inviting herself to party with her college friends and such), or the seeming absence of life experience or humor/sarcasm (caused by always being surrounded by yes- men I think). In short, it was exhausting *and* boring. I realized I didn't want any of that, and I was successful on my own, and then I met a nice lady closer to my age who I could actually talk to. And by ""talk"" I don't mean about the landscaper who absconded with the lawn mower."
15,"In 2005, my first year of college, a dude I’ve never noticed before ran up to me on my way out of class and said “Hey! I’m sorry if this is weird but would you want to hang out sometime?”

We hung out a week later. We recently celebrated our 5-year wedding anniversary :)"

17,"My dad passed when I was 5, and my mom put me into the Boy Scouts, because I wasn't really into sports. I really believe that it shaped who I am today more than anything else I did as a kid. Most of my positive male role models come from that program. "

21,"I was a young Lance Corporal stationed in southern California long ago. A week after competing and failing miserably in ""who can hook the biggest whale"" competition between fellow Marines in my barracks, I sought to avenge myself by competing in ""who can bag the oldest hag"". 

I won 2nd place, by getting in bed with a 58 year old lady. She said she was the vice president of some company and she spoiled me rotten. She picked me up, bought me dinner and drinks, then brought me over to her house. She was so aggressive and dominating that after she had her way with me I felt a little raped and taken advantage of.

Overall it was a good experience, she bought me lots of alcohol, expensive protective equipment for when I bought my first motorcycle, fashionable clothes that she wanted me to wear for her. When I was deployed, she sent me a big box of goodies every month. "
22,Use a spray bottle on her when she does it? She'll learn to not do it anymore. 
23,"I have a son who's 17. He's basically a clone of me. He loves computer tech and gaming. He's a bit too distracted by girls. If he's not instantly good at something, he loses interest. He's also too nice for his own good."
24,Jesus christ where can I find a woman like this
25,"She told me she had been feeling the same way and was too shy to tell me. There are few words that can describe the feeling of finding out your crush has a thing for you, but it was an almost surreal experience.


Honestly I hadn’t really thought that far ahead, I was so focused on admitting how I felt I didn’t actually consider if she had the same feelings for me. So when she told me she did I was over the moon.



Still going strong today, and I hope to marry her someday.

EDIT: Wow, thanks everyone for the well wishes! It still feels like I’m living in a fairy tale!"
26,"I must have done something atypical.

&amp;#x200B;

When I had my midlife crisis I went and bought a backhoe and dug a really large, really deep hole.  Took like 2 years worth of weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

then I filled it back in because who the hell wants a 4 acre hole.  

I edited it - it was a 4 acre hole dug over two years."
27,"Ehh, when I was 24ish and I thought it was rad.

30 year old me realized how abusive and unstable she was.

Well, I kind of knew she was always unstable but she was getting me drunk on a daily basis and having lots of sex, so I didn't care.

""A 22 year olds dick should just have sunglasses on, riding a skateboard all the time. It shouldn't be an orgasm, it should just be like AWWWEEESSOOOOMMMEEE.""

She flew me to New York as her date to a wedding, she paid for the hotel and most of our bar hopping and booze benders. She melted down and locked me out of her hotel room in NYC, which is the basis for my reddit handle. Most of our relationship was meeting up at bars, getting black out drunk and fucking. She paid for everything.

Did I learn my lesson from all this? No, of course not. I dated two women after her. They were nice, supportive, goal oriented, they got along with all my friends, my family loved them. What do I do? Destroy both relationships with my reckless drinking and rampant drug abuse, only to end up back in bed with the abusive sugar mama.

I'm an ass man. Emotionally. I like to feel the bottom."
28,Buy her a mini trash can for the car.
29,Just about every time I’m sick and can’t breathe out of both nostrils. 
30,"We are much more open in communication then my dad and I were.  My sex talk with my dad was “ you got any questions” ? Nope... ok then 

My son and I have talked a lot more in depth... about drugs , alcohol, sex, 

I think you men today have a much harder time with relationships then my generation 

Good book to read 
The boy crisis by William Farrell "
31,"I had a crush on a girl in my class, and I wanted her to find me attractive (shallow and not sustainable long-term, I know). So one day I said ""Imma lose 24 Kg (53 lbs) during the summer so when we go back to school I'll be at a healthy weight for my height"".

I'm 173 cm/5'8"". I went from 99 Kg/218 lbs (BMI 32.7) to 74.7 Kg/165 lbs (BMI 25) in 98 days. Lost too fast, but I was motivated as fuck.

When school started, everyone congratulated me on the weight loss... except her. Her only comment on my weight was ""why did you lose weight? You were fine before"". Ouch."
32,"I think society is actually progressing somewhat on this one, but there's still a long way to go. 

There's much less empathy for boys who need help than girls. Boys are taught from a young age that being tough and not soft is what gives them their value, and showing weakness is invariably punished. They learn to keep it in and deal with it themselves, because if they try to get help they'll be told to man up or the people they open up to will stop caring about them. 

There's a ton of energy being (rightfully) devoted to the issues women and girls face, but I think boys are still learning to stfu and suffer in silence. By the time they're grownups they express their feelings by getting together to have a few beers and watch sports, and express themselves no more emotionally than ""that sucks"" or ""that's great."""
33,"Hard to nutshell it but...

We are involved and supportive.  Always have been.  But we are not over bearing nor spoilers.

We have always held our kids to standards that would ensure they have options and opportunities in front of them.

We are not overly strict but we have rules and breaking them have consequences, just like life.  We are fair and fun......but we are parents FIRST.  Being friends with your kids is great (and we are) but that is not a necessity and should never come before the Parent/Child relationship (in our collective opinion).

"
34,Boys are taught that being a virgin makes you a loser. I struggled with this all throughout high school as I hung out with a large group of couples and was always the target of jokes and downright mean spirited comments that really made me feel like I was not worthy of a relationship. All we hear in our society is about how women shouldn’t be judged for having casual sex but then men are judged for not sleeping with a ton of women.
35,Clearly the giving type.
36,"&gt; better odds than any other approach

37,"Virgin anything. Bloody Mary (or Caesars for my Canadian homies) aren’t gonna really lack without the vodka. Other cocktails can be made virgin as well.

43,"Assuming a standard 6 year old is 48"", 45lbs, and doesn't like getting punched in the face, I think I could incapacitate 5 of them every 10 seconds. Based on how long I can go on the heavy bag, I would think I could last for about half an hour with ample rest time between spawns.

More likely to happen, though, is I would hit the first kid, immediately feel guilty for punching a child, run away, and then hit up the nearest liquor store to drink myself to oblivion. Kids win 10/10 by emotional KO."
44,"I've noticed this a lot in recent years. especially with an abundance of teacher/student sexual abuse. When female teachers abuse young boys it's headlined as ""having sex"" but when it's a male teacher abusing young girls, it's rape. Also, the amount of men commenting ""where were all the hot, horny teachers at when I was in school?"" is crazy. It's sexual abuse no matter what gender the abuser/victims are.  "

47,"Both really. Education, especially k12, is heavily dominated by women. Basically boys are disadvantaged due to the structure of the modern classroom and implicit bias. There's no shortage of new programs to engage girls in tech and science every year, but nobody is willing to talk about the fact that year after year boys are becoming less engaged. Even among the ones who accept that it happens don't consider it a real issue. Personally the statistics disturb be and points to a sexist bias in the educational system. Nobody wants to admit that maybe there's sexism against boys however, as if it can only happen to girls. "
48,"My aunt and uncle were married for 22 years(ish). He left her for a younger woman. It was so cliche, and really really sudden. She was a housewife, so she pretty much had no career to fall back on. She started from square one professionally. She was honestly a great wife, or it seemed so. Involved with the kids, attentive, great host and homemaker. 

About two years after he left, things blew up with his new young GF and he begged for my aunt to take him back. I think he realized, holy hell, we were together for over *twenty* years, and I just threw it away. She had moved on, though.  

I don't know if, after 20 years, he just got tired of the monotony, or the same woman, or got restless after their two kids moved out and went to college. Whatever it was though, he acted impulsively (or it seemed so - maybe he was thinking about it for year, who knows?) and seemed to regret it down the line. 

Basically, who the hell knows. Whatever was going on, the problem wasn't with my aunt. It was with him, whatever he was going through.

I'm sorry that something similar happened to you. I can't imagine how much that sucks. Hugs.
"
49,Horse women are way crazier than crazy cat ladies.
50,"We are entering a world where women are having more rights and that is great! But a side effect has become a skewed dating scene for young teenagers. 

Men have to be respectful towards women, yet they have to make the first move and not seem creepy. 

It's become VERY hard to navigate for young boys to strike that perfect balance. And It's especially hard for them since they have no experience in dating. 

I find that dating right now is harder than ever before, and not only for young men. "
51,She likes to spray little bottles of very expensive stuff on herself. I'm not sure that's a deterrent
52,My dad did this and just married the woman he ran off with. He says he's the happiest he's ever been but he has little to no relationship with his kids now. My mom is still trying to keep it together.
53,"Body expectations. It's just as unreasonable for all guys to be completely jacked and shredded as it is for women to look like barbie dolls. The pressure probably isn't as much as women get, but it's there. "
54,"When the inevitable question of what you both do comes up, tell them about how well the business is doing and how excited and proud you are, any that aren't gold diggers will immediately see that's you're a go getter with a bright future, and will forgive the temporary living situation.

Also, one small business owner to another, congrats on the success! I'm way past the futon stage thank goodness, but I love this quote so much:

&gt;Realize that sleeping on a futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing. You know what's worse, sleeping in a king bed next to a wife you're not really in love with but for some reason you married, and you got a couple kids, and you got a job you hate. You'll be laying there fantasizing about sleeping on a futon. There's no risk when you go after a dream. There's a tremendous amount to risk to playing it safe.

55,It would be a replication of the scenes in the matrix with Neo fighting the agent Smiths.

60,"I was raised in a New Religious Movement with heavy charismatic/Pentecostal leanings, and my father was a bishop over several churches. I was homeschooled until 8th grade, and the #1 topic of conversation in our house was the miraculous, prophesied growth of our organization.

I couldn't relate to other kids normally, and spent my adolescence pacing around outside my house and daydreaming about huge upheavals in the worldwide power structure, as prophesied by my religion's prophets.

My teenage sons are very skeptical, irreverent, crass, and sharp. My oldest has a 4chan sense of humor. My youngest is obsessed with Marvel comics. My oldest is really self-disciplined and driven and entrepreneurial. My youngest is very sweet and social and sentimental. Their lives are not about made-up stuff. They're having a lot more fun. They're nothing like I was. They're what I *wish* I had been, and it makes me incredibly happy."
61,"What a lot of people don't realize in relationships...

&amp;#x200B;

They start out fire-y. They start out with a lot of passion. They start out with a lot of ""I have to have this person in my life."" What's really going on are chemical changes in the brain that are basically like a drug, making you addicted to that person, and to the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

After time goes on, those chemicals stop being produced. You lose the ""passion"" and the ""fire"". Your relationship (according to some) has moved on to another level. The next level. It may not seem as intense and as amazing... but that doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

It's moved on to a relationship of comfort. Of friendship and deep understanding for one another (usually).

&amp;#x200B;

Some people don't realize this - and they tend to think something is wrong with the relationship. There really isn't, it's just the way nature takes its course.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to keep the ""fire"" and the ""passion"", you need to work on those things. Have more dates. Do more ""this is our first time doing this together"" type of activities. Be comfortable with the loss of the ""fire"" and enjoy the ""comfort"".

&amp;#x200B;

The choice is yours really. If you want fire and passion, go for it. Just realize - it's eventually going to fade away. You can't keep that going forever. Your body just gets used to all of those chemicals being produced, and the only way to get them flowing and having an influence on you is to start a new relationship."
62,"I asked my dad about this. 

When he was a teen, we both have a short temper and we're both really into music. But he was also popular and girls were into him, I'm more awkward and don't really talk to girls."
63,"I had a period in my life that you could call a “midlife crisis.”  I was 34, had been married for just two years but we were together for about 11 years (met when I was 23 and she was only my second serious relationship).   There were not serious issues in the relationship, we didn’t have kids, and we were in a good place financially having owned a house and a second weekend getaway home.  On the surface and to everyone around us things appeared perfect.  

The problem really was that, and this sounds weird,  but we were just best friends I guess.  I wanted passion and adventure while she was most happy reading a book.  She had some issues with depression and I did my best to deal with that but I just didn’t really know how to fix it (if even possible).  I finally reached the point where I realized, “is this all there is?” Which, for men, essentially the definition of midlife crisis.  

 I started the ball rolling and we separated. I quickly found how easy online dating was and that was that.   Looking back In some ways I regret how I dealt with these issues — having much more relationship experience now, I’m positive I would have had the emotional maturity  and experience to work things out back then.  I had a real problem communicating in our relationship. It was easily my biggest issue, and she was much the same.  That’s the one thing I worked over the years to fix — now I probably communicate to much. 

With all that said, 8 years later I just got engaged and I am in the best relationship I’ve ever had.  We’ve been together 2 years and honestly, it took me years after my divorce to, I guess, figure it out — and meet the right woman of course.  

Anyway, I could write paragraph after paragraph on this, but I did have a point in responding — it took a long time to figure myself out.  Your ex getting remarried, to probably the first girl he met (and the girl he cheated on you with?), probably a huge mistake.   "
64,"Not sure if this counts but showing emotion, i cried at a relatives deathbed and still got weird stares as i was crying the most, a lot more than my female relatives. Society says be the strong one and provide, be the 'man', then we get called horrible and heartless for being unable to regulate or express the emotions we've been taught to supress our whole lives... When we show are vulnerability we lose respect from everyone, even if we are stronger than those judging us because we are not being 'men'. Just madness honestly. Infact my kind nature is often seen as 'pliability' simply because im a boy and i have a hard time expressing my true and gentle self due to fear of judgement."
65,"I think the dating world is going to be very hard to navigate as the boys of today get to that age.  You still have the traditional mindset where the man always makes the first move, has to insist on paying even if the woman refuses, and the new mindset where people are equal, the man insisting on paying is seen as patronizing, and I think it's going to lead to a lot of confusion.  You have older generations believing that the man should be persistent in chasing women, and the new generation saying no means no. It's gonna be a headache for them, for sure. "
66,Boys are largely treated as defective girls in school.

69,"The first thing that's important to note, is that kids are not like computers. You can put in A and get Z, and you can put in A and get back O. That is what makes ""good parenting"" so maddening, and indeed, one child out of a pair of twins can turn out one way and the other the opposite. And, sad to say, you can sometimes do everything right and end up with a lemon anyways.

The second important thing is, as hard as it may be to accept for parents, is that the peer group is commonly much more important than their parental role models.

The third thing is to remember that he's *eight.* A kid. A lot of what you describe is kid behaviour - annoying kid behaviour, but kid behaviour. You cannot reason with him as you would with an adult. You cannot set up the same expectations as you would out of an adult.

That aside, I think there's one interesting pattern worth observing here:

&gt;  he complains about things like ""having to walk too far""

Bog standard normal for kids...

&gt; and collapses on the ground, whining

...overdramatic.

&gt; doesn't like losing board games

Bog standard normal for kids...

&gt; he cries when he's not winning at games. He shoves game pieces roughly and makes snotty pouting noises.

...dramatic.

Does he generally crave for more attention than he is getting?

At any rate, I would see to it that he spends as much time as possible with other kids, if at all possible in an environment that offers a large peer group, has rules, rewards team play, and doles out attention if you integrate. In our heyday, that was stuff like soccer teams."

73,"I was incredibly insecure about my body until I started lifting. I even remember my primary care physician saying that I’m overweight and I need to lose fat; man that hurt to hear 

Now I’m extremely secure. It sounds narcissistic but I love walking by mirrors. I’ve spend hours upon hours in the gym every week and I’m happy the results are actually paying off. I encourage everyone if they truly are insecure about their body to take steps to change it. Not only will you look better, you’ll be healthier and have a newly found sense of confidence. Actually starting to lift has been the best decision I’ve made in terms of my physical and mental health.

78,Mine didn't turn out well. Straight up told the girl I liked her and asked her to go out with me. She proceeded to give me some bs about how she can't date anyone until they've been friends for a long time. The final blow was she asked me what type of girls my better-looking friend was into. 
79,"No, he buys *himself* a trash can for recyclables.

She'll then feel a sudden need to use it for her trash, hoping you will ask her not too so she can argue with you so she can ""spice up your marriage"". 

You'll yell at her that if she wanted more in your relationahip she should have communicated better, but that was a mistake, she throws it right back at your face and you know you can't argue with it since it's true. 

So what do I do, exactly what my ficking piece of shit dad used to do and I start breaking shit. She yells at me to stop and that she can't take it anymore. She'll put her god damn trash in her pockets. You apologize and tell her it's fine it doesn't matter and now you're right back where you started but worse because now the neighbors heard everything and you know if you get a divorce this will definitely come back to haunt you.

82,"Genuinely don't know, but what I gather is that it's being flexible, accepting, tolerant, and emotionally-available for your friends without expecting emotional availability from them. It's about doing your own thing because you want to do it, not because it's what you're ""supposed"" to do.

Basically, what I gather the ""toxic"" bit is the rigid and judgemental male archetype that some people have; ""healthy"" seems to mean being open-minded and independent-thinking, which I suppose is good. 

Unfortunately, I've seen no encouragement regarding men expressing sadness or reaching out for emotion support in general, which I feel is a huge issue (mental health and all that, to say nothing of male suicide rates); IMO, ""healthy masculinity"" should include having an emotional support network and being able to grieve a loss without feeling ashamed."

84,"There was a fantastic comment from someone a couple days ago and it was; 

&gt; There's a strange push-pull in today's society where we both need to adhere to masculine gender norms but also not adhere to them. It's naturally more nuanced, but the messages we get tend to be contradictory.

&gt; You never share your feelings with me; man up, you're being a pussy.

&gt; Don't make women uncomfortable with your attentions; of course you never get laid, you aren't initiating.

&gt; Treat her like an equal across the board; choke her during sex, girls love it rough.

93,"Holy shit dude you've just explained to me why sometimes I saw parents at frat parties in college. 
I went to a private university, and it was a surprisingly commonplace thing. Not all parties, but some of the bigger ones parents would definitely show up. It was fucking weird, but those parents partied harder than their kids.

Edit: Details


Double edit: of all things, I would have never guessed a comment about bat-shit crazy, affluent parents would be my highest, most upvoted comment  and yet here we are. I'd like to thank my parents for birthing me, my teacher for inspiring me to get a better job than in education,  and the United States for drowning me in student debt. Thanks, Obama."

95,"I was raised by a career Army guy and a horse lady, so I grew up around them. Not only was mom an enthusiastic instructor and I liked seeing her happy, but dad had been a tanker and so valued the Army’s heritage in cavalry. So horsemanship to me was a part of even becoming a man, period.

I love horses. They’re powerful, majestic, and graceful creatures who can also be goofy retards. They can be bitches sometimes, but they can also be kind/sweet, and when you’ve been around them for long enough you find they’re more predictable that way than people are.

They’ll carry you on their back for miles and miles, through terrain that would stop any off-road vehicle, and then their shit can be used as fertilizer. 

I have seen horses nuzzle toddlers and let them hug them and pull their whiskers, and also myself been tossed off of or knocked down by horses as a 5-10 year old child... and later in life. I’ve seen horses at a breakneck gallop across open grassy fields straight out of Hollywood, and I’ve also seen them literally eat their own shit.

Historically, they have run themselves literally to death for their riders before, pulled plows for agriculture and carriages for transportation, carried food, ammunition, and soldiers for hundreds of years, and been butchered to feed hungry soldiers or people stricken with famine.

They’ve walked with us for five thousand years, second only to dogs but imo being *much* more useful to us as a species. 

In terms of to us as a sex, I think it’s a damn shame that horsemanship is seen as effeminate or plainly forgotten. Some of the answers to this post ignore the animal entirely to discuss horse girls as sexual conquests. Some of the others profess fear of them, which is wise, but part of manhood to me is to not let fear dictate what I can or can’t do, and trotting a thousand pound animal around the mountains is pretty fun.

Tl;dr horses are fuckin’ rad."

100,"Finally a question I can answer. 

So I was dating a woman about 15 years older than me (mid 20's) for a a couple of months. It was great. I had just gotten out of a pretty toxic long-term relationship with a person who really didn't treat me very kindly. This woman, on the other hand, was incredibly sweet and supportive. We got along very well and the relationship evolved from something purely physically to something closer to a friends-with-benefits type situation. Albiet, one with a very clearly defined power-dynamic. 

I would cook for her, help her around the house with things like mowing the lawn etc. And she would take me on dates to places I would never have been able to afford on my own. She would also give me presents or buy me clothes, little things, but it felt amazing to get that kind of attention. 

She was recently divorced, in incredible shape, and knew exactly what she was looking for. She actually approached me in a bar. All and all a very positive experience that ended amicably. We still see each from time to time, although platonically now. "

He told me the story, and I independently asked the teacher to tell me what happened through e-mail.  Their stories matched. The kids were in line to go to the library.  They were asked to be quiet so they could begin walking, some of the other students were being noisy.  A little girl piped up and asked, “don’t y’all want to go to the library?” My son, just said, “no”.  He wasn’t being cheeky, he seriously didn’t want to go.  I actually had to explain to the teacher that both kids were actually being disrespectful towards her for talking when she told them all to be quiet.  If the note home was about that, then I would understand, but she singled my son out for “disrespecting” another 9 year old.  This is not the only time I have had run ins with teachers about how they treat girls v boys. Don’t get me started on coaches. "

They show all these violent things woman do when men cheat, which I'm not condoning, cheating is wrong, but woman get away with doing things that a guy would've faced backlash for had the roles been reversed.

Found a group of guys to play with during lunch and started to notice I was losing some weight. So I decided to start eating more healthy as well and even more weight was lost. That's when I decided to get serious about it and have a strict diet and started lifting weights as well. With eating mostly clean, playing basketball and lifting weights, I lost 75 lbs. It became such a part of my life that 10 years later and I'm still keeping up my routine. "
133,"Serious answer: be good looking, good at flirting, and most importantly, go to the right places.

In a Dallas suburb called Legacy, there's a bar named Sambuca 360. The average clientele is age 35-45. Again, that's average; I went there once and saw people easily in their 50's and 60's. Me and my girl at the time (23, 24 respectively) were the youngest in the bar by far. Legacy is full of divorcees and is kind of known to cater to an older, richer crowd. We call it Cougarbar for a reason... 

Another way is to go to fancy, expensive gyms like Equinox in the late morning, usually when everyone is working.

Good luck!"

We also make a point to date each other and have new experiences every month so that there's always something to look forward to.   


I actually saw a comment on reddit several months ago where a husband talked about how he and his wife have been together for nearly 10 years and, every month, they go on a surprise date. They alternate who plans it (so one month it's the husband planning, next month is wife, and so on), and the person getting surprised is only allowed to know what to wear and when to be ready to go.   


I started doing that with my husband and it has been WONDERFUL. Just this past weekend, I surprised him with two tickets on a scenic train ride, accompanied with first class lunch and a flight of beers. He was ecstatic, and it was such a joy seeing him so excited about what I'd planned for us.

She was also way more into it than I was.. she was backing into me so hard and I was losing wood fast. Eventually I half slipped out and she bent my dick at an almost 90 degree angle.

The teacher did get sent somewhere else after it surfaced. The guy didn't want to press charges, but even still that woman should've been banned from teaching, period.


I guess she would show up to parties still (she was young, but what person in their 20s parties with underaged high schoolers) and when asked about it she'd respond like it wasn't a big deal.

217,Probably because they don't want to feel out of place with their friends who are drinking and/or get a million questions about why they're not drinking. Personally I hate the taste of alcohol as well so I'm fine paying for an overpriced but okay tasting drink.

What's really strange is they kept telling me that I was creepy when I was fat and now they tell me I'm a one of a kind saint. It also makes me realize just how much appearance plays a role in how people are perceived. "

Time is in short supply. Attention is in short supply. I'm gonna have to figure out a way to make it work though .

I came to the state so that my husband could get medical treatment to extend his life and now I am in trenched here.

247,"Coaches tend to blanket their treatment of boys.  My son is the tallest in his grade and extremely athletic.  I’m not saying it will always be this way, I’m saying that’s the way it is now.  He’s also his mother’s son, very sensitive, and emotional.  He plays “the big three”, basketball (year round league), baseball, and football.  We have extensive experiences with coaches.  Many times the coaches just yell to yell, they aren’t really saying anything.  In basketball, for example, my least favorite coachism, is “C’mon you gotta finish that!” My son is the kid that already knows that he needs to finish it, by the time the coach yells that he’s already beating himself up for it.  However, if you tell him, “next time, jump up a little higher and turn your hand” he will follow your directions to the letter, and he sees a direct correlation between his movement and his success, and will continue to do it.  After many crying episodes, where he was yelled at, and just shut down and didn’t want to play, his basketball coach figured it out.  I think a lot of coaches a used to coaching kids who are difficult to coach, or flat out uncoachable.  We live in TX, so football is forced on a lot of kids, and football coaches yell.  They tell me it’s character building, but then they can’t tell me how.  Especially to kids like my son, who already will do anything you say, if only you ask. "

Once she went clothes shopping. She got home and was upset because some of the clothes weren’t what she thought they were. I told her to just take them back and she said “that’s what poor people do.”

It got so bad that she said she was afraid of me and left - she walked out the door as I was screaming at the top of my lungs that I'd never hurt her, that I was doing that so I didn't have to punch her. Even as she left, I placed the blame of my shitty, *unexcusable* behavior on her.

In reality, I just wanted to 1) Let my anger out; 2) Get some attention and care, without having to say it out loud that I was hurting so bad - that I was vulnerable, deeply insecure and depressed.

After that, the hardest part was seeing how well she was doing without me to pull her down. She grew into a magnificent woman, while I grew stale and bitter.

This was about 10 years ago and I have since done some therapy. I'm okay now, I've found meaning and joy in my life, which in turn led to a lot of fruitful things - but I've never forgotten who I was. I've recently talked to her again and I really, *really* wanted to apologize for everything, but I was too ashamed. I think she kind of realized that, though - when we hugged goodbye, she whispered in my ear she was glad I was a better person now. We both exchanged a look of curiosity as to what could have been, then went our separate ways.

For all of you guys who are hurting and angry out there, I know that the world doesn't offer us a lot of emotional support, I know that we often lie to ourselves saying that if we're truly strong, we can stand on our own, but sometimes we really can't, and there's no shame in seeking help - it's definitely a better alternative than doing what I did. Having to make peace with my past was one of the hardest things I've ever accomplished in my life, but it *can* be done."

303,What did that woman do for a living?
304,"I don't know what went on in your husband's head, but I know many men who've done this, essentially. What it comes down to is that they got married too soon, to women they weren't compatible with in terms of values, interests, libido, life goals, aspiration and temperament. The ones who are reasonably well put together did better with their second wives, who were a much better match for them overall - thankfully most of them remain good Dads to their children if any were had with the ex, and don't appear to have made things any more unpleasant that they had to be.

EDIT: Not condoning what your ex did for a moment though, that was a dick move and if it was out of the blue with no discussion or openness about the state of the relationship as well as the infidelity, then I don't think he's going to do as well as the men I know who did it through ""proper channels."""

311,"Very different.  

When I was a teenager in the 1970's young males did not discuss masturbation or drug use in front of their parents or anyone else for that matter.  

Our teenager did both and when I explained that it wasn't really an appropriate discussion topic in open company he (and his friends) thought that was an ""old fashioned"" mindset.  Keep in mind this wasn't discussion in the context of asking questions it was more like hey, I just rubbed one out, a friend would say I did before I left.  I'd say gentlemen, no one wants to hear that, keep it to yourselves.  

He also thinks it's okay to work when you feel like it.  If the job doesn't allow that, they aren't worth working for.  I've never had that workplace mentality, nor did anyone I knew as a young person.  Many of us hated our jobs but we knew if we were late or didn't show up we'd be fired immediately.  

I'll add that I'm a technical director who has hired many, many technical personnel over the years.  In recent years, when I've hired young people I get some really bizarre behaviors and comments.  Such as, ""can I work from home coming to work is impacting my personal life"",  After accepting a full time job and discussing it extensively in the interview process, in the first hour of employment she asked ""can I cut my hours to 20 hours per week, 40 is just not going to work out for me"".  I hired a 30 year old woman as a secretary.  She immediately started showing up 4 hours late every day.  I asked her to come into my office.  She sits down in the big comfy chair (door is open the whole time) and I calmly said, I noticed you've been coming in late a lot lately, is there a problem I should know about?  ""no"".  Okay, you're going to have start getting here on time then.  She stands up and walks out of the office.  Then writes an email to HR stating she felt trapped  and has a problem with authority so she won't be able to meet with me in the future.  LOL!  Another employee would come to work and talk about her personal life including her sex life, how her boyfriend is a heroin addict, how she used to ""turn tricks to pay the bills"". She constantly wanted the other employees to babysit her kids (for free). It created an enormous amount of workplace drama which all ended poorly.  A good friend is also a manager and has an employee who regularly talks about her and her husband's swinging exploits and that they're both bisexual swingers and attempted to encourage their coworkers to participate.  The coworkers said no and asked her to stop talking about it, which she refused.  The coworkers threatened to file a lawsuit if my friend didn't stop her.  

I guess what I'm getting at here, is that it's all fine and dandy to feel comfortable discussing your sex life and to think the workplace should change to meet your needs but that's not what works in the real world.  People don't want to hear about your sex life, employers largely can't alter their working hours to accommodate your personal life. People judge you (whether they should or not) if you tell them your partner is a heroin addict, etc.  People lose trust in you as a person and can't rely on you to be a good teammate.  "

I've been with my wife for about 30 years now.

To maintain passion you have to commit to it - both of you.  Passion can be more than just sex - it's really about shared excitement.  If you really have nothing in common then you will have issues down the road.

If you want to have excitement you both have to commit to being exited for each other.   Also, marriage lasts a long long time - you are looking at between 50 and 70 years together.  My wife and I celebrated a big milestone together a few years back - we celebrated having spent more than half your lives sleeping in the same bed.

&amp;#x200B;

And the ebb and flow - it's real.  complacency leads to contempt and that leads to the end.  So - be vigilant, be committed and have some fun together.  Some times it's hard.  Most haven't faced real challenge in their marriages. Wait until a child dies or your wife miscarries;  one parent and then the other getting sick and dying, crippling accident or cancer; your kids going to college and facing life on their own terms.  That's  when you find out what your marriage is made of.  

If you find your marriage is getting stronger through those events then you can be certain you've done it right."

In my drunken state, I half jokingly replied ""your place, cause my wife is home at mine!"". She said ""okay, let's go"".

That night started a multi month afair that ended with me leaving my family and moving into a luxury condo she had rented for me. She introduced me to the 'finer' things in life. High end restaurants, exclusive clubs, etc. 

A few months later she invited me to move into her multi million dollar 'house'. We traveled to California so she could buy me a Maserati, as my Mercedes wasn't classy enough. My jeans and t-shirts were replaced with high end fashion. Months went by with my every need taken care of, and almost daily gifts, usually consisting of something she decided I needed to change.

After about a year and a half, my divorce was finalized, and was drinking...a lot. I had been asked to resign from my position at work due to our relationship, I had lost about everything in the divorce, and most of my friends. But I was living the high life, right?

I woke up one morning, after a long night of drinking, and literally didn't recognize myself in the mirror. She had changed me, from the outside in, and I had gone along with it. I had tranformed from a grungy, white trash bred hillbilly to some polished piece of arm candy to be seen (oh, but not heard) at social events. 

I moved out a week later, into a small, dingy house in a not so good part of town. She sold the car, cut me off from everything, and called me every name in the book. She thought she owned me, and I owed her back for everything she did for me. I'll never forget her statement, ""I made you a somebody, you were nothing before you met me""

That was 8 years ago. I have since reconciled with my son, and have gone back to living what I call a 'real' life. I have 2 dogs, which she would have never allowed. I drive a Nissan, which would have been unheard of. I don't leave dirty dishes sitting out for the maid to get. 

All my life (I grew up dirt poor), I thought I wanted to live the 'rich' life. It wasn't until I did that I realized it's all a sham. There are no friendships, no real connections...it's all about being able to show other rich people you fit in. Everyone is so worried that they won't be seen as being part of the crowd that everyone is pretending, hiding behind their masks of money. "
327,"Men dropping out of education is pretty bad. Most of the 30's career women I know who've been crushing it since they graduated are now sick of their jobs and looking to cut back on their work hours or drop out entirely in order to start families - many have no intention of returning to full time work ever again, and these are senior professionals not unskilled workers. If there are not enough qualified men who are willing to fill those increasingly vacant skilled positions in future, what will happen?

338,You weren’t up to the challenge kid.  Better luck next time.
339,"Maybe I'm just projecting or being biased but I feel like two things tend to happen and they both start off at a young age. One that boys who don't receive dating experience at a young age end up being afraid of expressing their own sexuality because they haven't received any positive validation and are afraid of being seen as a creep or harasser because women often complain about men being those things. Two: Those who have received experience and have a history of receiving sexual interest now must defend themselves by saying that they are not ""fuck boys"" because girls are afraid that they are just another conquest for these guys.

Both sides also feel a need to be respectful toward women because reputation is still important. Being labeled a fuck boy fucks up a lot of these guys ability to date, and being labeled a creep labels you as someone who isn't attractive enough for the girls and that you don't actually respect women's boundaries (even if that isn't true). So the guys who want meaningful relationships first often take things too slow and end up friendzoned for not showing sexual interest earlier because women are used to being bombarded by sexual interest. So many guys and girls opt for a quasi-dating lifestyle out of fear. Women want guys to lead but guys are afraid of showing interest so they hangout instead of date. Both men and women see other people for fear of expressing too much interest in one person and often both sides end up disappointed. Why? Because both know that women have ""options"" due to dating apps and both people often focus on the wrong thing early on in relationships and dating.

Young men now have to also deal with social media and a higher competitive field in dating. Guys from all over the world can be messaging your girl on instagram complimenting on their body, calling them beautiful, etc... and young men/boys don't have the emotional maturity of understanding that the girl wants them and not what they believe is attractive. I actually have had this conversation a couple of times with teens and freshman in college.

It's really hard to find that balance and I think mistakes for young men can impact their lives much more. If you mess up it can be blasted on social media and you can literally lose friendships, scholarships, and on by messing up once. Hell I lost a lot of friends due to a girl I was dating started lying about me and called me a manipulative liar and creep just so she can be with another person from my friend group at the time. I received harassment from her friends too. Mind you I was 22 at the time and I've seen teenage girls to much worse. Word spreads much faster than ever and so a lot of people are more afraid of messing up now more than ever. A bad joke can really mess up your reputation. A person lying leaves enough doubt in everyone and it can change how people view you. In my case, even though I've known these people my whole life, we have been surprised enough times that we think anything is possible so it's easy for someone to get #MeToo without actually having done anything. 

Sorry for the rant but it is pretty fresh on my mind since I had this conversation with a friend of mine who also works with teens."

342,"See, I have a problem with this comment, and that is that it seems to paint the wife as a villain for changing her lifestyle to look after children, when presumably both members of the partnership made the decision to have children. Of course women wind up changing more when children are brought into the relationship - we as a society put so much more pressure on women to parent than men, and more often than not its the woman who is doing the bulk of the child care and staying at home.

Yes, I figured as much.

&gt; I like where I live and I like my job but it does mean that I do not have any support structure that will provide him with additional adults that will give him attention.

Like I said- clubs, activities that provide him with company, attention and the chance to excel, which will do his self-esteem a great kindness. Doesn't have to be sports if he's not the sportive type (although I believe in kids getting lots of chances to be physically active and enjoy their physical energy).

363,"I wasn't initially going to respond to this, but I feel like I may have a few things to add to the advice you've already received on here.

You son spent most of his life seeing his father in a, for lack of a better phrase, in a compromised state, and then lost him at 6 years old. He may still be processing that internally, but may have no idea that he's feeling this, or how to communicate it properly.

You're obviously doing everything you can for your kids, this post is proof of that. One thing I would suggest though, is actually talking to your son. This may sound ridiculous, but he may feel like you're talking AT him and not to him. Most people's first reaction is not a temper tantrum or complaining off the bat. However, at the prospect of not being heard, or feeling like they're not being heard, escalation in behaviour happens. And that's no matter what age you are. Asking him how he's feeling, or why he needs to do what he's doing to get your attention. Then LISTEN. Actually listen. Don't interrupt with an excuse, or an explanation when he's in the middle of talking. Wait for him to look at you after he's stopped speaking so you can continue the conversation. Also, from a physical perspective, if at all possible in the moment, get on his physical plane. Whether that's you two sitting down, or you squatting down to his eye line, it helps establish a non confrontational dynamic, and he'll be more likely to engage in non confrontational conversation with you. Another thing I can't stress enough, is believing your son when he says something. Whether or not you believe it to be true, that's how he feels, and how he's observing the situation. You will lose all progress if he says something, and you respond in a way to tell him how that's not true. What that says is that his viewpoint and perspective is incorrect, and that the conversation was pointless. This leads to anger and resentment. 

The next piece of advice I would give is not to compare him to his sister. They're different people, and you will need to accept that fact. They'll come into their own at different times and in a different way, twins or not. But what they won't appreciate, is being compared to each other like it's a competition. Previous points to resentment and such.

The last piece of advice I would give you is to look into a Big Brothers type program in your area. Having a mentor that he can talk to, hang out with, and that's not his mom will help. Kids always act better for other people, and with a different relationship dynamic from the beginning, he's more likely to engage, and pick up positive behaviours naturally, not because he's being forced to.

I really hope some of this helped, or you can tell me to fuck myself. I wish you the absolute best of luck with this, and remember even on your bad days, you're doing a great job."

Not every guy who messages you wants to fuck you, some of us are actually doing it for a reason. 


**EDIT:** Lmfao okay well I had no idea telling people to ""fuck off"" is perfectly normal and socially acceptable (according to some replies). I didn't even think I'd need to add this but she said more than that. I can't remember exactly what but it was something along the lines of *Fuck off, I've got a boyfriend, it's clearly on my profile, go jump off a bridge you dumb fuck*.  Something like that but didn't matter to me, I don't care if your simply telling me to fuck off, or if your telling me to kill myself, if you got that attitude expect me to respond the same. If you still disagree and think I should have still cared about getting her ID back, then I'm sorry you were raised a pushover. 

She had so many other options. She could have ignored, she could have blocked, or even just normally said ""I have a boyfriend"". I stand by what I did. It also doesn't matter in the slightest that my message was vague, you don't tell someone to kill themself because they sent a slightly vague message. I'm not a creep, I'm not a rapist, I don't send dick pics, so don't treat me like I do.

I hear her walking up the stairs. Help. 

EDIT:

Alright so, this is kind of a long story and is going to read like a blog post, but I do have experience with ""horse girls.""

First, there's two types of horse girls (and riding styles).  English, and Western.  Western girls think that English girls are ""snooty"" and English girls think that Western girls are ""trashy"".  Western girls will drink Bud-Light with you around a bonfire at the ranch, English girls will drink Vodka Tonics under the Rolex/Land Rover tent at whatever event they are competing in.

This is a story about my ex-girlfriend, an English rider.

She competed in what's called ""three day eventing"" which are competitions that last three days, where they do Dressage (basically horse dancing), Cross Country (riding super fast and jumping over stuff), and Show Jumping (jumping over stuff in a ring).  And she was competing at a pretty high level, and was VERY well known in that circle.  Even though there's lots of events all over the country, everyone kind of knows each other and they all trailer their horses across the country to come compete at these events.

It was super attractive meeting a girl that was so driven, competitive, and also knowledgeable in a field that I really knew nothing about.  I don't know about you guys but having a girl teach me things/skills that I don't already know is really hot.  But, these horses were her LIFE.  There was no work/life balance there.  At the time she had three horses, the most expensive was a $200k Irish sporthorse.  (She had ""sponsors"" that helped fund this, and they also were horse brokers.  They [her mother and her] would buy horses, compete them up to a high level, and sell them for 4x what they bought them for.)

She'd usually leave for her events on Thursday morning, and return on Monday afternoon.  Every weekend, about 40 weeks a year.  This was more than a ""hobby"" to her, however her goal was basically to make it to the Olympics (which she very well might do some day), but she had no backup plan, it was kind of a pie-in-the-sky goal.  Also, while she made pretty decent money doing something that she loved, all of that money went right back into it, so she really didn't have a ton of income.

Being a ""horse show boyfriend"" is an interesting position.  You're mostly hanging around horse people, who are pretty nice for the most part although definitely snooty.  But you are like 5th in line for her attention at all times, even on days where she's not competing.  When we got an apartment together, we had a move-in weekend and of course she was going to be gone that weekend, but she was also going to be gone for the next 3 weekends after that, so I ended up moving us in by myself with my friend's help.

Over the course of that relationship I met a lot of other horse girls her age.  I should also note that there are two types of horse girls (regardless of English or Western riding discipline) there are the girls who are up at 6AM driving to the barn to muck the stables, and then there are the girls whose parents just pay someone to do all of that for them.  Most of the latter type drive brand new Range Rovers that dad bought them, and have never actually had a job but have more money than you and me combined.  Luckily, my girlfriend wasn't that spoiled, because those girls, while usually physically attractive, have very ugly personalities.  So, while she wasn't that bad in that regard, most of her ""friends"" were.

I don't really have a lot of ""spoiled brat"" stories about her, but her friends on the other hand, holy shit.  One of her younger friends who she coached, who was about 18, had rich helicopter-parents who would do everything for her.  One time they were both driving out of state and the friend needed to use the bathroom, my gf told her they'd stop at a gas station, and this girl honestly had no idea that gas stations even had bathrooms.  See, she'd never had to get gas, and any time she went somewhere with her family that was far enough that it required more than a tank of gas, they'd charter a private jet.

We broke up for a few reasons, one being that she had an affair with one of her ""sponsors"" who was a very wealthy man twice her age, who was also a good friend of her dad's.  That's honestly all the personal information I can say about that, because his lawyers still threaten me occasionally (that's a whole other story.)  

Over about 3 years that we were together, she only missed one horse show, and it was for her sister's wedding, and even then, they made her schedule the wedding to be on a weekend of an event that wasn't as important as the others.

Let me be clear, I respect and appreciate how driven and dedicated she was to something.  But, it bordered on an unhealthy addiction, surrounded by really fake snooty rich people, and unless you are someone who also really enjoys horses, you're always going to be a ways down the list in things that her attention is on.

She was also the kind of girl who when I'd ask what she wanted for dinner, she'd say she ate a croissant for lunch and so she's still full.  She was *very* fit, not just thin, but in very good shape, didn't need to lose a pound of weight.  But her mom would give her a bunch of prescription diet pills that were basically amphetamines, and she'd take them even though I begged her not to.

It's not that horse girls are *bad* per se, but it's important to note that they are definitely *different* than most girls. 

Pros:

- Horse girls are usually in really good shape.

- The ""Horse Girls Love Anal"" meme is true. 

- They are driven and dedicated to something.  And (some) are willing to put in a lot of work to accomplish their goals.

- English riding gear is hot, tight breeches, that sexy competition blazer and boots, damn.

Cons:

- Their parents are always kind of trying to pawn them off on you.  We weren't even together 5 or 6 months and her mom was asking when we were going to get married and stuff.

- You have to plan even a simple ""date night"" weeks in advance, sometimes months in advance during show season.

- You'll always be third in line for their love, behind their horse and their dad's money.

- Horses need so much fucking attention jesus christ they are dumb animals.  If there's a 3"" deep hole in the field, they'll find it and step in it and fuck up their legs or something.  They have to be fed and turned out several times a day, stalls have to be cleaned, there's vet appointments and farrier appointments every other week, and they are a bigger money-sink than even boats or cars.  I was making decent money while we were together and there's no WAY I could have afforded to help her with that and also pay rent and eat.

- It is their LIFE.  When you get together with their friends, family, associates, it is ALL they talk about, so unless you know all these other horse show people by name, or know a lot about horses, you're going to sit there quietly like an idiot in the background, no matter how much you genuinely *try* to learn.  If you try to change the subject, it will be back on horses within 30 seconds.

Sorry if this story was kind of anti-climactic, unfortunately I can't tell a whole lot of it here.  I know lots of people posted waiting for the update, and I'm sorry if it wasn't as interesting as you guys hoped. "

It’s not the worst thing in the world to be short, but it’s a legitimate setback, but if you actually voice that, people will just tell you no one actually cares and you need to get over it. "

426,"My wife cheated on me with her boss. I’m a little less than a year out from it and I’m doing really well. 

Look into the book 

Living and loving after betrayal
By Steven stonsy 

It’s really good.

Also r/survivinginfidelity is a really helpful sub


People who don’t know how to communicate and then have a mid life crisis don’t make decisions based on knowing themselves. They make decisions based on them not knowing their hearts and not being able to manage their emotional needs. Sound like he wasn’t getting them met in a healthy way (it’s his responsibility to do that) and since he wasn’t getting them met (maybe wasn’t even aware of them) he went to the person that thought he was the greatest guy ever (classically someone who’s job is to serve him, his secretary). Every guy wants to feel like he is The Man and a secretary does that all of the time. Her job is to take an interest and support someone with their challenges at work. 

For me

My wife was in a tattoo apprenticeship with a Christian tattoo artist. I thought that having a really good roll model would help her since she was having a tough time in life. She is/was an incredible artist and she loved tattoos so it seemed like a great idea. He didn’t know shit about himself though and she had been struggling with various issues since before our marriage. He had 3 kids and a dedicated wife who was the youth pastor at the local church. She and I wanted our spouses to live their dreams and we were very supportive, but that didn’t matter because our spouses didn’t know themselves and thus they didn’t know how to care for and manage themselves. My ex wife thought he was the greatest thing and in his shop he was miles ahead of everyone. He won awards and talked shit about other people not being as legit as him (this was my first red flag, because real leaders don’t talk shit). The rest played out as you can imagine but to me the shocking part was how devious and manipulative my ex got. I couldn’t  believe that she would even think to destroy a family with three children. It was crazy to me, but when people live out of not knowing themselves they will only live to get their basic emotional needs met. So while those two where filling the void in one another’s hearts, they would do anything to keep that high going. That’s all it is, a high, It’s not real. It has something about it that look real but the relationship is built on a very poor foundation and there are a million cracks.

I’m just outlining some of the various things that lead to an affair. I was an awesome husband, but I didn’t have good boundaries and I put up with things that I shouldn’t have. 

They broke it off. He went back to his wife (she shouldn’t have taken him back) and my ex is mentally unstable and wants me back. People don’t get away with having affairs. It’s not possible. You don’t betray your spouse and build a healthy relationship out of that. Sure, it may look good from the outside but internally he and her are wrecking themselves and their marriage. Not only does your ex not know himself in a deep way, not only has your ex had an affair, but he now is building a life for himself and his new wife on an emotionally unstable foundation. This will effect their family very powerfully for generations to come. 

I recommend getting to know yourself. I hate to say it but if this just came out of nowhere then you were missing a lot of signs (I had a similar experience).

You have a ton of wounds and pain and you need counseling. You need to throw away the bs ‘I have it together’ image that your ex puts on and go and learn to care for yourself emotionally. Do you have a good community around you? Do you go to a good church? I can only speak from my experience, but I recommend pursuing that. I don’t have kids and I know that complicates things but what I’m saying is very important. If you take care of yourself you will have a future that is light years beyond the life you have had in the past.

I’m sorry that your husband cheated on you and then left. That’s bullshit and really sucks.

427,"In highschool, I nerded it up with some nerds on the bleachers at lunch. It was a convenient perch out in the open and there were some friendly looking people there. So there I sat. I was friendly, they were friendly, it was fun.

A few months go by and I've spent maybe half my lunch times with these people. Lily asks me if I like hockey. Sure I do, I say. Would I like to go to her brother's hockey game with her? Sure I would, why not, technical hockey is the best hockey! 

So we go to the game, we hang out, we eat nachos, we talk, we watch hockey, we go our separate ways. 

I come in to school on Monday, and at lunch time, I'm approached by a different girl from the group and she is **pissed**. She starts laying into me about how cold it was how I chose to break up with Lily out of nowhere and that I owe her more than that. What? Broke up with? Lily? We've been *dating* for **how long**?!  Not only was Lily convinced I was attracted to her, according to her we were a full blown couple with feelings and emotional indebtedness!

Grew up being told that I had to *control* my emotions and honestly didn't grow out of it until after going to college for two years.

Eventually I decided to stop bottling it up and just let it out as it comes.

I'm... much happier now that I'm honest with myself. I'd rather let it out as it comes than bottle it up and explode.

They can't murder you.  It may feel like they suck your soul out when they say no, but it's not the end of the world.  I promise.  Have been told (many many times) and I continue to exist.

446,"So the really difficult thing to say here, almost impossible without coming across as an asshole, is there is a slight schism when it comes to womens looks and preferences. A woman will come on here and talk about how her SO is sensitive and cries and itll get upvoted to heavens.....the brutal truth nobodys ever addressing is what that woman looks like. Yes that needs to be addressed, because i suspect a lot of these women, to put it quite nicely, dont have their pick of the lot necessarily and so dating a sensitive guy isnt that big a deal, because theyre probably used to letting a few potential dealbreakers slide, whether they realize it or not. The women with dudes falling all over themselves almost never stray from the same cold, stoic men theyve always dated. I havent seen that changed in the slightest.

449,"I had one for about a year, it was great. When her dad passed she inherited his multi million dollar construction company. Met her on Martha’s Vineyard when I was visiting a friend who had started working there for the summer. Martha’s vineyard is a very very affluent place. It’s an island off the coast of Massachusetts only accessible by boat with mostly multi million dollar homes. While there I saw former basketball star Ray Allen, Justin Bieber, and Ben Stiller. The bars there are always packed in the summer and it is the ultimate grounds to find a rich cougar which is what I intended to do. The bar we went to was called The Ritz. I met her there and after some flirting, dancing, and drinks we went to another bar together. 

She was from Spain and maybe 40. Eventually she invited myself and my friends to come back with her friends as well. Fast forward and I gave the best fuck I could for about 2 hours straight. Eventually I went back home to NYC and we kept in heavy touch. Talking everyday and she would always be planning stuff for us to do. She lived in Boston but would come to me almost every weekend. She had a crazy high sex drive and whenever we did something she always paid. We Went to Spain, ate out maybe 100 times, couple sporting events, and she bought me my Mercedes. Only when she wanted to get super serious did things go south. I was 22 at the time she was 40. I just couldn’t wrap my head around introducing a woman barely younger than my mom to my family. 

Now that I am several years older I want that opportunity again, so I’m moving to Fort Lauderdale.

He texted me a few days later saying “hey, what are you doing on Friday? I really like you and want to see you again.” So confident it was sexy.

But I was a round peg forced through a square hole. Instead of teachers taking my enthusiasm and guiding it towards something productive like the topics that really interested me, they just stomped, beat, scrutinized and ridiculed it out of me.

 In high school and college I would often find someone i liked and then try to befriend them. In the process I'd become completely infatuated. When I finally Confess to them that I liked them and they inevitably shot their friend down, I'd feel resentful that I spent so much time investing in this person.

This causes two things, super cringy neckbeard behavior and an unhealthy view of women. You try to fake being their friend in the hope they ""turn around someday"". Its really fucked up because you're objectifying women as an almost game. If I just put in enough time or effort or money or listening then someday I get that person. So you eventually become their toady more or less.

It wasnt until after college where I went out with a friend twice and made a move. She inevitably shot me down and it was like a lightswitch going on in my mind. I didn't feel resentful because I wasn't infatuated, and I felt relief after because I knew she wasn't into me. But the best part was the person is so cool that I still wanted to be friends with them.

So after that I started being forward with my intentions and using definitive language to outline my intent. I now ask people on ""dates"". And after all that I'm having much better luck than I ever did before, and I'm not a spiralling depression soaked neckbeard"
