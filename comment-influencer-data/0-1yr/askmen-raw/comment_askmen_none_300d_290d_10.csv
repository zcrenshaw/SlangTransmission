0,shot her fork out of her hand with a nerf gun while she ate breakfast
1,"Her father owed us money. He paid up but when I went to deposit it at the bank it was confiscated for being counterfeit. Now I’m waiting for the police. 

This is some how my fault. "
2,[They do now.](http://sketchtoy.com/68806485)
3,"Ah yes this happened many a time. These were the reasons:

- She said no."
4,"My daughter (when she was about 7) asked why me and my sister had long names but our brother, Shaun, has a short name. I told her that Shaun was short for Shaunhamptonson and I convinced my brother to go along with it. Somehow it came up at her primary school and a teacher asked me about it in front of her, so as not to embarrass my daughter, I told the teacher it was true and the lie was then set in stone. My daughter is 13 now and I know she’ll be really embarrassed if I now tell her the truth, so I’m dreading the day when the truth will out."
5,"I thought it'd be funny to tell a girl from high school that I had a twin, not realizing she had such a huge crush on me that she would have believed anything I said. I did almost nothing to reinforce the lie, yet the last time we spoke, she asked about him. He's doing great. He's married just like me..."
6,"In high school I invited a girl over to my house and offered her something to drink. I brought out two mugs of whatever beverage it was and she asked why I grabbed mugs. The truth was they were the closest thing, but I said deadpan “I only ever drink out of mugs.” Why did I say this? I have no idea, but I had to keep it up the next two years while I dated her. I remember one time I was at her house and grabbed a normal cup for water when her mom said “I thought you only ever drank out of mugs.” I replied with “uh yeah but I saw this was still dirty so I thought I would clean it off for you” and my dumbass proceeded to hand wash a single cup in silence before putting it back and grabbing a mug. I received three mugs as gifts. I hate mugs now. "
7,My best friend? I'd just tell them. Its why we're best friends.
8,My girlfriend looked over as I started reading this post and got angry about it. 
9,Your roommate mustn't have seen it either because they clearly don't know the first rule of fight club. 
10,"When I first met my ex, she was talking about her (girl) friend who was colorblind. I made an offhand comment about that's rare, ""colorblindness is usually in guys like me"". She thought I meant _I_ was colorblind . . . and instead of correcting her right away in front of her friends I somehow decided to let it go and correct her later. Except I forgot. Long story short, for two years I had to pretend to have trouble with reds and greens because after I didn't correct her right away, there was really no good time to.

I'm glad we broke up, because now I can see colors"
11,Some things are worth getting in trouble for.
12,"Not really my lie but I had to live it. One day at dinner with the family we were eating a salad and I asked my older brother what these crunchy things were on top, because I liked them. My brother told me they are called ""ghostie Toasties"". I never questioned it and up through college I was still asking friends if they wanted ghostie Toasties with their salad until someone finally asked me wtf I was talking about. That's when I realized they are called croutons and I was living a lie thanks to my brother. They still mess with me about it. "
13,My wife was mad this morning because she dreamed that I bought 5lbs of weed with my BIL after she told me not to and we had to spend our whole vacation hiding from the cops.
14,"When my son was a toddler, I was getting some sugar from his momma when he came toddling up and demanded a ""sandwich hug""; you know, baby in the middle. I muttered under my breath ""little cockblocker"". He proudly calls out ""blocka blocka!"" and gets his sandwich hug. For the past 10 years, he has been demanding ""blocka blocka"" hugs, and can't figure out why I think it is funny."
15,"On my first day in uni, walking through the freshers fair, someone walked up to me and said ""so you didn't go to [other uni] then?"" Confused me said ""no"" and we got chatting. Turns out she thought I was someone she met at that other uni's open day, and I didn't have the heart to tell her that wasn't me. We promptly became incredibly good friends, and she is godmother to my eldest. Still haven't told her that our friendship was founded on a lie... "
16,"I was in a long distance relationship with someone I had met studying abroad. I sent my then girlfriend a picture of my family in which my dad's arm was bent at an odd angle in which it appeared his lower arm/hand was missing. She jokingly asked if he had one arm, and I soberly replied that he did.

It didn't come up again until I introduced her to my dad. She was very surprised to find out that he had two arms. I believe the first thing she said to him was ""You have TWO ARMS!"" She confessed to me that she had been very nervous about meeting him and offending him by accidentally staring or something. Honestly, I had no recollection of telling her he had one arm but it sounds exactly like some dumb ass thing I would say."
17,"Me: thanks ma'am im flattered. But i have a girlfriend. 

Girl: sure you do. You're  probably just  gay.

Me: Then i guess you're  wasting  your time aren't  you?"
18,"She accused me of raping her.

She was my best friend's gf and came to visit me at university after they had an argument. We went out and had drinks with friends then she came back to my place. She tried to hook up with me to get back at my friend. I refused and slept on the sofa.

When I went back to our home town the next weekend, I discovered she was telling everyone I raped her. I was threatened with violence, lost a lot of friends. Never really went back again much after that.

I was never arrested or charged. Her bf made her go to the police when her story was getting more and more violent and fantastic and they saw through it straight away. But to this day there are people who say I'm a rapist because ""everyone knows most rapists get away with it""."
19,"My wife was angry that I was happy to have a quiet new years' eve with just her and our daughter, which is exactly what she said she wanted to do.  Apparently I should have offered to invite some of our friends over too, even though she previous said she wanted a quiet evening without them.  Apparently it would have been nice to have offered to host a party again anyway.  I'm still confused..."
20,"Figured out what makes me happy and learned how to enjoy life on my own.  People can tell and are attracted to that as cliche as it sounds.  No one wants to have to provide your happiness, they want to join someone who knows what they like in life

I know it sounds cliche, but at 41 I'm both happier than ever and doing better dating than ever.  Also helps if you stay in decent shape while everyone else loses it"
21,i told her that when we have kids i'm gonna make them fight like gladiators from an early age so they're powerful enough to achieve world domination when they grow up
22,"This is funny...

About five years ago I asked this same question on my old reddit account. Best friend found the post but never said anything. She just started acting differently. Kept her kid away from my house (her kid was the Tasmanian devil and my kid is this ball of anxiety on a normal day) 

Stayed my friend for FIVE MORE YEARS until this summer she said she can’t do this anymore and told me her secret...and couldn’t be my friend anymore.

She held on to this for FIVE years!

Anyways... no advice just wanted to tell you my experience with this question LOL!


Edit: OMG GUYS! My first GOLD and on my alternate alternate account! I’m literally freaking out THANK YOU!"
23,"My dad raised three daughters and three granddaughters. The end result is that he has tons of female friends because he understands them very well. He can read moods a mile away. He can offer advice and empathy. He makes women feel safe, listened to, and important. He can braid hair, he sews and does laundry, cooks and cleans.

And he is scared to death of women. Many women have tried to date him and he runs away.

Edit: he's not gay; he runs from romantic relations, not women;  he's a great guy and has had very severe health issues his entire life but always worked hard in the mines to keep us girls housed/fed/clothed, etc. and he's just a really great guy. "
24,Wait until the wedding and drop the bomb that it was a running gag for all those years 
25,Her loss. She missed out on BigDaddysCock
26,"I got called gay as well. She also told all of her friends that I was gay. After reading the responses so far, looks like it's common. This crazy went on to completely stalk all of my social media. Blocking her resulted in new accounts being made up. Honestly have no idea what she thought it would achieve "
27,I guess karma isn't just for reddit.
28,"She gave me a kiss in the morning and I said something like ""Careful, you keep kissing me like that and I'll have to use my morning wood on you""

She became very upset because she thought somehow that meant I didn't want her to kiss me... I thought it was a compliment.

EDIT: You know what this thread is making me feel so much better about life right now."
29,"""Bro I know we best friends and dat.........but your son is a lil prick"""
30,"Took a shower without her. She likes to shower together which is fine when we're both home, but I got home from the gym before she did and needed to shower. Now I'm Hitler. "
31,"the ""vacuum lines"" I leave in the carpet are wrong"
32,"Drives the same car as you, same wife, same kids

Hold on here for a minute bukaroo"
33,"I don't know, but it's been the way since ancient times.  Roman ruins have dicks scratched in them all over.

Pick one:

1.  The phallus is a powerful primal symbol, and phallic imagery was incorporated into the sacred iconography of the earliest known religions.

2.  Huhuhuh *dicks*."
34,This will end in tears. 
35,"Once, we were waiting to cross the street and a little girl started making faces at me. I returned the favor. The grandmom scolded the little girl and told her not to talk to me and looked at me like I was about to kidnap that child. I felt like shit, but later I felt sorry for her. "
36,"My wife's idea of cleaning out the van is shoving everything into a box and setting it in the garage. After a week, I move the box to my ""holding area"" and there it sits for a month or two. At some point it makes it in the trash and is never talked about. I have been doing this for 20 years. "
37,Because she has showed nothing that suggests her interest in me and l don't want any awkwardness in the group.
38,"Look at the bolts that connect the panels to the vehicle. They come painted the same color as the car from the factory. If the paint is chipping, or it looks like there's been a wrench on them, that could indicate that bodywork was done on the car and the panel has either been readjusted or replaced.

Make sure the VIN behind the windshield matched the VIN on at least one other panel (ex: driver door) and also the title.

Look for rust that is perforated on either the body or frame of the car.

As others have said: tire condition, tire brands, and mismatched tires will give you a good indication of previous ownership.

Pull the oil cap and look inside with a flashlight. Look for sludge or coolant mix. Basically make sure the oil looks clean and smooth. Red flags would be a metal shavings or a frothy or chocolate milkshake appearance.

Crank up the car, open the hood, and just take a few moments to listed to the engine. Some sounds are normal, but listen for loud tapping or clunking sounds.

When you test drive the car, keep the radio off. If you can, keep the ac/heat off as well (test them separately). Drive the car both carefully and aggressively to put it under different loads. If its an automatic transmission, listen and feel carefully for slipping or jumping of gears. And watch the tachometer for over revving. If it's a manual, listen and feel for grinding, or getting stuck/popping out of gear.

During you test drive, make sure the odometer turns at least one full mile.

Watch for smoke when accelerating. Bluish smoke indicates that the car is burning oil through the exhaust, and dark/black smoke indicates serious major engine problems. \*EDIT: Black smoke will be normal on some diesel vehicles.

If possible, always test drive the car with the engine cold. There are some mechanical issues that ""go away"" after the engine and transmission are warmed up. Some sellers know this and will warm the car up before showing it.

There are a lot more tips and resources out there. I would recommend going on YouTube and checking out a channel called ChrisFix. He has posted a series of videos on buying used cars and has a checklist you can download. Not all of the information is perfect, but it is really helpful for beginners.

Source: I was a buyer for major auto dealership for 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT\* One more thing to add, download the ""myCARFAX"" app. It's free, and you can scan the VIN and it will show you all of the *reported* maintenance and repairs on the vehicle. "
39,"My buddy bought a small Northern Pike (fish) for his tank, but it ended up being too large. Took it to my parents hours to release it behind their place. My mom saw it, asked what we were doing, and I told her it was a pet we were going to raise.

Later, she asked me why I would waste money on a pet fish we would never see again, so I quickly came up with the lie that we had it tattooed, so we could easily identity our Pike if it was ever caught.

It's been over 10 years now, and most of my family is in on it now, except mom. She has told neighbors to watch out for our fish, wanted to put something in the community letter, brings it up often. Random people will ask me about it.

There have been so many embellishments and details added over the years, it has hit the point where she will kill me if she ever finds out. It almost always comes up at big family holidays, someone asking if we have caught it yet. One day I'll have to photoshop a Pike with the appropriate tattoo."
40,Dream me has made my IRL girlfriend mad at me a few times too. Damn him. 
41,"She took it kind of okay. But the friend we met through called me and yelled at me on her behalf.

""But she's so nice!!""   
""But I'm not attracted to her""     
""Since when has that ever stopped a guy?""      

Needless to say I've blocked both of them"
42,"She told me she wanted to date me, and I had to reject her because I wasn’t attracted to her, basically. I chose my words carefully, trust me. 
She told me I was stupid and never talked to me again. She then proceeded to tell everybody I was an awful person, and she’d literally insult me every time I’d see her (two or three times in the following months, all by chance). I know for a fact she still talks shit about me when she has the opportunity.
This happened in 2013."
43,I have 2 sons who can be jerks.  If my best friend told me that I might be a little sad and miffed but I know they would be right and wouldn’t blame them.
44,"At my first job I jokingly told my manager I was Jewish and couldn’t eat something she brought to a work thing we had bc it had bacon all over it(it really just looked gross). 

I only worked there for a couple years but she’s sent me a Hanukah card every year since I met her. From age 16-28. Every time I see her around at the store or out to dinner in town she always asks if I got her card and I always tell her yes thanks so much! "
45,"At the beach a number of years ago on the North Carolina Coast I was keeping a close eye on my kids in the surf.  There were a couple other kids around playing in the surf with my kids.  All of a sudden this girl about 4 or 5 years old gets smashed by a large wave...completely took her out.  Dad Instincts kicked-in and ran about 10 feet, picked her out of the surf and carried her back up on the beach.  Her parents came flying over...I thought oh hell...they're going to think I'm carrying their kid off.  Fortunately my kids were right behind me and were asking her if she was OK.  The parents figured out quickly what had happened and thanked me.  That could have been a very different situation if not for my kids....thanks, kids. "
46,"Taking a long time on the road. In traffic. Again. 
""You should ask your employer to leave an hour early. We live further than most.""
""Yes honey, no can do. 300 employees and I'm as dispensible as any. Why would he do that?""
""I mean, it would be NICE.""
""I KNOW""
""YOU ALWAYS KNOW""
"
47,"I shrunk one of her expensive cashmire sweaters once. She shamed me by making me wear it around the house for the next half hour, and relieved me of laundry duties. Now she's very skeptical about letting me near the washer and dryer."
48,"My daughter is the greatest thing to ever happen to me. She has literally saved my life (Different story for a different time). 
   
This is obviously my experience, and may not be relatable or helpful, but here it is.    
   
I would say i was pretty dead inside in general, I'm not well connected with my emotions (personal trauma) and I'm not nor have i ever been good at emotional connection and feeling things.  
Then i had my daughter, this girl is just pure raw emotion. She feels everything, she loves so deeply, she laughs so energetically, and she fears and experiences hurt in an extremely raw and open way.  
I want to know my daughter, and to be a father to her, so, I've had to learn to connect with her *at her level*. 
This has made me much more attuned to feelings and emotions.  
  
That's the simple objective way of describing it. But, at a much deeper and more life changing way, she has changed me. There really is no language for the change I've undergone. The spiritual / emotional change, it's a rearranging of my very core self. It's like seeing the ocean for the first time, or seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. My entire perspective on life, love and existence is fundamentally altered.  
    
Because of her, I notice so much more going on around me with friends and family. Even at work I've noticed that i pay more attention to how women are treated (i work in an extremely male dominated industry) and i find myself purposely asking female coworkers for input during meetings and staying silent in order to maximize their time. 
  
My daughter is literally the light of my life, she makes this whole fucked up world beautiful and alive.  
  
Edit: Thanks all, it's people like ya'll that make me less worried for my generation :) "
49,"I'm 30 now and still doing poorly with women  
I'll keep you updated "

53,"This chick in a bar wearing a wedding ring literally offered to fuck me if I bought her a few beers (even told this whole story how her military husband is gone all the time and said he's ok with her fucking other men as long as she gets something out of it). Well sorry not sorry, but I ain't that kinda guy. I rejected her offer. 

She immediately started shouting at me, called me a f*g.. her friends had to push her out of the bar.. she was yelling at me the whole way out. My friends and I just sat there laughing. 

I ran into her at the same bar a few days later and she came and sat with me and my friends and tried to flex how many houses she owned. We kindly told her to go home then. "
54,"I'd think this would be more of a deep heart felt connection kind of thing. 

But anyway... do her chores for her. Cook for her. Don't pamper her but make her life easier for a little while."
55,"Usually two main reasons

1. I like them a lot but deep down I know that it realistically won’t last and I don’t want to waste her time

2. Cliche, but terrified of commitment. And know if I dated said girl I would eventually push them away, and put them through unnecessary emotional trauma because I’m a selfish piece of shit. 

Edit: Getting more views than expected so I’ll further explain. I’m 27m, and over the past year I have realized I was doing these things, I used to be a real jerk. So I’m working on it. I make it clear before any hook ups now that dating isn’t an option for me right now. I think some guys just take longer to mature "

57,"I buy all our plane tickets. The day I was supposed to meet his family for the first time, we found out at the check in counter that he had booked his own ticket for the NEXT day. 

I flew out to meet his family alone."
58,"When I first met my boyfriend (now husband) he made a comment about my blonde hair. Something about me being just another girl that dyes her hair blonde. Everybody was blonde that decade. Lol
The comment made me mad so I said said he was wrong and it was natural.
I figured I could say whatever I wanted and it wouldn't matter since he'd go his way I'd go mine and that would be that.
We started dating shortly after and I didn't want him to know I was a liar so..... I'd touch up my roots on his days off and hide all of the evidence. Even when we lived together.
He never ever suspected a thing.
Years went by. We got married. Had a kid and I didn't want to be blonde anymore but I was already in too deep to turn back now. How could I explain going through all of that to keep up such a small lie? 
So I started dyeing my roots a slightly darker shade of blonde bit by bit and over time til I got the color close enough back to my natural color that I could stop dyeing it altogether without being called out about it.
It worked.
Years later we were talking about hair for whatever random reason and he was like ""Remember when you used to be blonde?""
I'm like ""Yeah! It's weird how much darker your hair gets with age.""

He shall never know.

"
59,"I rejected her several times, each time ending up with her friends accusing me of being gay. At one new years eve party I was pretty drunk and she basically threw herself over me. Made out for about 2 seconds until I threw up all over her. She never tried to hook up with me again."
60,"For me I've had a perspective on women and girls for as long as I can remember but for a similar reason. I'm the middle child of 2 sisters. My younger sister in particular was a good looking girl and was only a grade below me, A lot of the same guys that harassed her on a daily basis would harass me too. Trying to get under my skin saying my sister was hot and how they're going to fuck her and stuff.

Really opened my eyes to the kind of target she had on her and definitely helps me believe women when they say they've been attacked or harassed. "
61,"Two times actually, one told me I was going to die alone. 
The other wrote me a poem and started dating one of my friends, they are still together after 3 years so I am very happy for them"
62,"Wife was being snappy so I went upstairs and gave her some space. Came down 20 minutes and decided to stop and hug her. She bursts into tears? I just hold her until it's all out.

""What was that about?""

""I was sitting here thinking how I don't know why I'm being mean to you and that really I just wish you'd come hold me... and then you diiiiid \*more crying\*""

""... Oh, okay."""
63,/r/threadkillers
64,Usually my face is a strong enough ward to keep relationships away
65,"That I’m in a healthy/happy relationship so I don’t have to feel bad turning down my coworkers. I’m single as a Pringle. 

Edit: I work in a female dominated industry. I want to avoid all things pertaining to relationship questions or discussion’s. I find it best when in saying I’m currently dating someone and leave it at that.  I don’t want to he hooked up with your friends or daughter. I don’t want to see someone at work then have it fail and it be awkward.  "
66,"Spoiler alert: she just wanted to start a convo with you, and pulled out the ol’ “have we met before?”. Her side of the story is that she thought you would looked nice and wanted to chat!"
67,That's fantastic.  
68,"My roommate brought home a smoking hot girl from the bar, but she was about as smart as a bag of hammers. We're all chit chatting as he's making his moves and I'm wing-manning like a pro. Thinking this girl's was surely not going to make it past 9am next morning, I went rogue and told her that I was struck by lightning and now couldn't feel hot or cold. I damn near gave myself frostbite and 2nd degree burns holding onto an icepack and running my hand under the hot tap. She was fascinated, entertained, and inebriated... The holy Trinity for one night stands, so my roommate took her upstairs. Turns out he would go on to date her for 2 years and I had to keep that going whenever she brought her friends over.

The things Bros will do for their fellow Bros."
69,“Tango down”
70,That’s hilarious. Did she think you were gonna slap her with your dick or something? 
71,I used pledge to clean our wood floors. She didn’t know until we watched our cat fall over from it being so slippery.
72,They might agree with you. 
73,[deleted]
74,Not closing the shower curtain. It apparently prevents mold and I forget every single time.
75,She caught me eating a leftover cupcake for breakfast instead of a muffin...
76,Eh fuck them. Making faces at kids if they are doing it to you is fun.
77,"She called me gay. It was pretty funny how offended she got by me politely rejecting her. I wouldn’t even say “rejecting” like I just wasn’t down to fuck at the moment, she didn’t take it well. "
78,Meta
79,"This is similar to something I did with a colleague.

I couldn't hear a word of what he was saying one day (low voice, thick accent) so I made an off-handed comment while pointing to my ear: something like ""I'm a bit deaf."" 

Ever since then he speaks very very clearly to me and makes sure I'm looking at him when he talks.  It's been a year and I have no clue how to broach it with him 😅"
80,"&gt; He can braid hair, 

I can't even do that and I'm a woman "
81,Thank you. I really think they should hire me. 
82,"Come on man, you're not Hitler. You're just a /u/RapistNextDoor. "
83,I got called gay and then she tried to make out with my friend.
84,"I was at a bar trying to get a few drinks to bring back to my friends table when a woman out of nowhere grabs me and asks me to take a shot from her cleavage. I said nah and just kept walking and she cussed me out and called me a fag. It was sort of funny but really sad. 

I also had a super drunk woman try to get me to come back to her room at the hotel I work at and I just said I'm gay. She shouted fuck you and stormed off. "
85,"I cleaned my wife's car out once as a surprise just because thing. She was pissed because I threw away some super old receipts and what if she had to return those things? ""Honey I don't think you're going to return that $1.36 bottled water that you drank several months ago"" was apparently the wrong thing to say."
86,Or yesterday when I put her on speaker when driving and she heard herself echo and thought I was with another girl😐

stays in fast food places.

"
88,Power move
89,She woke up at 2am to me playing and singing along to Christmas music because it was snowing outside.. Yeah that one might have been justified.
90,"From what I've seen it has been alot of guys being called gay, rumors being spread, and some sexual assault. How classy."
91,"Two nights before high school graduation I was out with some friends and my dad let me drive his new truck. We were out by a river drinking beer and avoiding the cops. End of the night I""m parked a little weird and when I go to back up my front end drops down and I put a dent in the bottom of the truck. My dad didn't notice for six months, sadly during that time my brother died. When my dad did finally notice I blamed it on my dead brother. That was in 1994, I told my dad a few years back what really happened and he just laughed.  

Sorry Billy"
92,"She wanted a drink from outside the door because it snowed last night and I told her I didn't want to go out there either. She begged and pleaded so I said I'd get it if she said ""please get me a drink because I'm a lazy and rude girl"". I ended up getting it anyways."
93,IT'S NERF OR NOTHING
94,You *know* why
95,"It has happened a fair bit. A lot of shrieking. 

I think the worst was waiting for me to get drunk and trying to jam her hands down my pants when I was passed out, thinking that if I came to with her riding me or something that I'd just roll with it.

She was evicted from the tent pretty fast.  Worst camping trip."
96,"That’s a great idea, What a ‘Father of the Bride’ speech that’ll be! I’ve already got a story about telling her that if a panda get’s hit by lightning, their black bits turn white and their white bits turn black....she told her teacher that as well. Being a parent is great!"
97,I will now call them ghostie Toasties in solidarity
98,"I'm a school janitor and I can safely say I've never seen a dick drawn in the girls bathroom, but they're always all over the boy's bathroom. I have no idea why, we drew boobs when I was a kid."
99,Im fucking awful at picking up signs. Thought she wouldn't want to date me.
100,That I didn’t want or love her even after she threw punches at me and couldn’t understand how punching me doesn’t make me love her more
101,My girlfriend is a bartender and some old guy gave her his number and told her what hotel room he was staying at. She told me this and I was a little annoyed but it comes with the territory. We got into a fight later that night about something inconsequential and she essentially said “He treated me better than I ever have” needless to say I’m rethinking this relationship.
102,"Didn't really attract women until I got engaged. All of a sudden it was like I have been vetted and approved and all these people come up to me sad that I am off the market. Like, wtf?! Why was nothing said or communicated? Up until then I was always the pursuer. After I stopped chasing they came to me. Weird how life works."

Edit: obligatory ""of course my highest comment is blah blah blah..""

Also, we've had a lot of laughs here tonight, but real sexual assault is no laughing matter and is widely under-reported by all genders.

 Also, in case it needs to be said, don't fuck your family. "
105,"To make the longest story ever short: yes. Girl I worked with wanted to have sex. I was married. I said no. She told my wife we had sex. Wife believed her. Wife divorced me. I'm still single 12 years later. It's funny,  now I have serious trust issues. "
106,"Wooooooow. Fuck that bitch. Speaking as someone who's uncle is fighting a false work rape claim, that even his boss knows the girl is lying as her and the female boss were working together all day, it can ruin people.

He's been suspended indefinitely and his ex alcoholic wife has taken the kids too. "
107,What was stopping her from inviting people over? 
108,"worth it,feed the loser to the lions"
109,"She got into bed last night and aggressively backed into me for the cuddles.  In her haste she essentially 'heel-kicked' the front of my foot leaving her with a small cut on her heel where she grazed a toenail and almost folded it back on me.  This was my fault, first because she assumed i had let my toenails get long (i didn't) and after she saw that this morning she changed it up to just being a victim because 'all she wanted was cuddles' but instead i laid there and let her kick me, hurt herself, then get mad at me for it.

I'm a monster."
110,"I've lied to my Dad for years when he asks about my sexual ""conquests"". I think he was something of a playboy when he was younger and really likes the idea of his son sleeping around with lots of women, and maybe even living vicariously through me since he's married. Ever since I was a teenager he's been encouraging me to go out there and just plow as many women as I can, doesn't matter who.

I'm almost 30 years old now, and I've never brought any girlfriends home to meet my parents or told them any names of girlfriends. I tell him things like ""yeah I've been with plenty of chicks  but with dating apps nowadays, relationships are so fleeting. "" Excuses like that.

Truth is I'm a virgin though. I've honestly never even approached a woman to ask her on a date. Don't think I ever will. He's gotta be super suspicious about my lack of sex life but if he knew the full extent of just how unsuccessful I've been with women, he'd be so disappointed."
111,"This is key. A friend will tell you your kids are cute. A best friend will tell you your kids are fucking assholes.

112,"When I was a teen, I got into a car crash that totaled my car with my girlfriend in the car. Well my dads friend started telling everyone it was because I was getting road head and was too busy to pay attention. I’ve been going with that for 6 years because in my twisted family, it sounds better than the reason being that I was looking at my fingers for a short second because they kinda hurt. "
113,"Don’t just say “your kids are monsters”

You need to be very specific about what bothers you and make a shit sandwich with it. 

“I love how Braden makes such cool things in the sandbox, though whenever he throws handfuls of sand into my drink, it frustrates me. He is so creative!”"
114,I could just imagine that her kid wasn’t even that bad anymore by the time she finally brought it up. 
115,Cheap weird brand tires. It means that they've spent the bare minimum on the rest of the car and there's probably shoddy workmanship and missing service items from shit auto shops. Even if if has service history.
116,"Stranger danger is a fiction.  

4 out of 100,000 reported missing in the USA are abducted by a stranger, the most likely person to abduct a child is a relative. 

A parent is the most likely person to kill or hurt a child. The most common is by car on the way to and from school.   

The most likely person to abuse a child is someone known to them.  

This is why they have started to change education about stranger danger to tricky adults.  "

I’d forget cute and go with things that help her cope. Talk to her if she wants to. 

Talk about something other than that. 

Keep her away from people and situations that will remind her. 

Give her time and space and comfort and be there to support her but you cannot push her through this or do any one thing to make the grief or pain go away. 

Good luck.

120,"I don’t feed the dogs anymore. We’re both veterinarians and she has very specific (read: over the top bonkers) feeding plans for each of the three of them.

123,"Washing the duvet.  First, I had to ask what a duvet was.  Oh the heavy blanket on our bed. Cool I can handle that.

Apparently there is a duvet cover,  and I was supposed to wash that, not the whole thing. 

I have paid dearly for that one "
124,"In normal polite society you honestly can’t tell a friend their child is a monster without some very hurt feelings.  Most parents are very protective of their children. This is a case where honestly is not the best policy.  If you say this to him, there’s a 124% chance he will relay that to his wife and she will hate you.  Promise.

Only suggest non kid friendly outings, and just decline to come over to his place if the kids are around.  He might suspect that you don’t want to be around his kid, but you won’t be the asshole who said so to his face. 

This is a very common problem as your friends start to have kids.  I absolutely have a very similar situation going on. In the last 7 years, all of my friends have had children and a good lot of them are horrible. Learn how to navigate it now.

If you don’t care about the friendship, by all means tell your friend his kids are horrible.

130,"Her family bought us pajamas for Christmas coming up. I watched her bring the bag from her grandmas house, to my truck, and from my truck into our house. She can’t find the pajamas, so naturally I lost them. 

Update: I found them, wedged under the passenger seat of my truck. Turns out she put them back in the truck so she wouldn’t lose them. "
131,"I'm a teacher, so I am totally comfortable talking to most kids, maybe even more than I am with adults.  I'm used to parents knowing who I am and their younger kids, who I don't have yet, will know me, too.  I think it's important that kids have friendly social interactions with adults.  It teaches them how to act.  The problem is that kids have poor judgement.

Here's how I generally act towards kids I don't know/don't know me:

1) Never approach kids I do not know unless there's a reason to do so which directly addresses their safety.  In this instance, your only goal is their safety and not to chat afterwards. Conclude the mission and then leave.

2) If approached by a kid, be open and friendly.  Unless following rule 1, don't go anywhere with the kid at all, and don't encourage them to come with you. If you need to leave them, encourage them to return to their guardian and then leave. Speak loud enough to be heard by passers by and keep to yourself physically, don't offer hugs or anything like that.

3) Treat them like you would any stranger, really.  Kids are just little people.  Don't try to be a kid with kids, it does not come across well to anybody.  Speak like an adult, listen more than you talk, acknowledge their excitement and say things like ""that sounds exciting"" and ""that must have been hard"".

You aren't making friends, you're being a pleasant person to be around.  Model that, and chill.  It's a kid. If a parent freaks out, it's not because of you, it's because of them.  

And DFTK, don't fuck the kids!"
132,Yep...I’m the first to say my kid can be an asshole. I’m working on fixing that but he’s 2 so...

There is one man leading a group around and trying to reunite the human race. He lands on an abandoned planet trying to follow the tracks of previous humans. He doesn’t know if we have been there before. He lands and looks at the rock formations and mountains and sees a penis etched in the side. “We have been here” he says.
135,he's even got a twin like him

137,Talk to them like adults 
138,"I need approval to hang anything. I'm 6'4, so I hung the mirror and clock in a new apartment without thinking and went on my merry way. 5'3 girlfriend was not too amused when she had to strain her neck to see the clock and had a perfect view of her forehead only in the mirror. "
139,"Definitely would not. The only words out of my mouth would be ""Thanks Babe!!"""
140,It made me realize how toxic I was in some of my past relationships. Some of my past behavior was disgusting and reprehensible but I didn't see that until I reflected on it after she was born. After I had my daughter I thought alot about what it's going to be like for her growing up and the things I'm going to have to teach her so she can protect herself from not only the overtly aggressive man but the passivity aggressive man. I was the latter and regret those actions and behaviors. I wish I could communicate this to those woman I've hurt and give a honest apology but I feel like it's not fair to open unwanted communication with someone I've hurt just so I can feel better about myself. 
141,"My coworkers still think I have a year old baby.

I was in an extremely emotionally abusive and manipulating relationship. Looking back at the pictures of me are unsettling. My face was jaundiced and I just *looked* depressed.

So let’s get to the meat and potatoes. Unbeknownst to me, my ex gf faked being pregnant or had a fairly early miscarriage that she hid from me. Fast forward to the due date, she texted me saying that she went into labor and that she had the baby. For context: This was just one text message and I was at work. I start jumping up and down telling my coworkers that I’m a dad and I run outta work. I kept calling her to see where she was so I could visit her and the baby. She didn’t respond.

Not responding was nothing new to her. There was always some excuse. She didn’t show up to my family reunion because “she was in jail for an old warrant” or my moms wedding because “she missed her flight” or when my mom came into town to visit because she accidentally slammed her hand in the car door. (She actually did do this but not on accident. She legit broke her hand to not see my mom). Even though this was her M.O., her not responding still had a devastating affect on me. I was a wreck thinking the baby or her died. My family friends and coworkers kept asking me if the baby was okay. Trying to cover up the abuse, I lied and said yes.

Finally after several days, she comes home in the middle of the night and says the baby was still born. I was devastated. I wanted to see my baby. I called every hospital so I could see my RJ before she was cremated. But there was no record of “ex’s name” being admitted or a stillborn being delivered in any of the hospitals in a large radius around me. 

I ended up having a breakdown in a hospital lobby. A receptionist took pity on me and called a hospital patient counselor (or something to that effect). She hears my story with great patience. Tells me she’ll be back in a few mins and explains to me without violating HIPPA, that my ex was never pregnant, there is no baby, and that I have been given fake ultrasounds for the duration. (And that my ex had lied about being a doctor. She failed out of med school).

I came clean to my family and friends about my ex’s deceit, but I couldn’t to my work bc I had taken all the FMLA to recover mentally. I assumed I could’ve been fired for telling them that there is no baby. Now I have someone every day or so asking me how my dead imaginary kid is doing and I have to respond. It’s killing me on the inside.

152,"My daughter is only 21 months old so my perspective still has a long way to go. That said, I’ve heard quite a lot from others as they react to my daughter doing various things...

- _daughter counts to 10_ “girls are so smart and learn so much faster than boys!”.
- _daughter holds crayon in hand while watching her boy cousin break them in half_ “girls play so much different than boys who just want to hit things”
- _daughter eats vegetables_ “boys are always such picky eaters!”
- _daughter says any word that isn’t mama or dada_ “boys talk so much later than girls, girls sure love to talk!”

I know there is _some_ science that supports some of the above, but the comments about boys talking later and girls learning faster come from parents comparing their boys who are 9-24 months older, well outside the range that research says is within the normal “delay”.

So all of that said, I’ve learned that so much of what my daughter is doing is being chalked up to her simply being a girl, and my wife and I are curious to see just how long that happens versus people recognizing our daughter’s hard work (and our own) to develop these skills."
153,"My wife thoroughly enjoys cleaning, it's therapeutic to her. When we first started dating I would sometimes find her watching dyson vacuum higlight reels on youtube. I bought her a steamer just because I felt like it, but it turned out to be one that was not 'versatile' enough. It needs to be used for not only clothes but drapes and carpet. 

Her reaction when I showed it to her: ""Did you even think about thow this would affect me?"""
154,"When my daughter started dating and she was upset some guy ghosted, treated her like shit, what ever guys do. She would be crying to me about what to do. I only knew that from the guy side and I know his motivation. So, I had to stop doing that to the women I met.  I was, for a while, use em and lose em. I just cant do that anymore.  I do guess I date better women now.  I don't date women that I wouldn't want my daughter to meet.  Before she almost never met any because I knew they wouldn't be around long enough to make a positive difference for her. "

161,"It really depends on what makes them monsters in your eyes.  I mean are they like hitting you or breaking your things or just doing the annoying things that kids do?  My two best friends have kids, once that happened my life changed along with their lives (albeit not to even a close degree!).  If I wanted to see them I would need to hang out at their place more often than not.  No more football games at the bar, it was games at their house.  I adapted to it. Yeah my friend's third grade daughter can be an annoying attention seeker in the fourth quarter sometimes but she is my family in my eyes.

The problem you have is that if you tell your friend the kids are assholes you tell your friend he/she is a bad parent in their eyes.  "
162,"I'll be honest with you. That happens more frequently than I would like. I literally walk around with a ring on my finger (I'm engaged and in my country is costume for the male to also were a golden ring on the right ring finger.) And some people will still try to pull that kind of talk.

If the explanation for why she wants to keep it uses the words ""might,"" ""could,"" or ""should,"" as in ""I could use that for crafts"" or ""I might use that in cooking"" or ""we should give away/recycle/sell that,"" then you know it's trash.

But it's a fine line.

There's trash she really wants to keep, in which case you must wait a month for her to forget about it so you can throw it away.

There's also the much more subtle situation where she feels morally obligated to hang onto it to prevent ""waste"" but what she really wants is for *you* to be the one who immediately throws it away out of her line of sight without her knowing about it. That way she has plausible deniability and any charges of moral turpitude will fall on you.

Discerning which type of trash-keeping scenario you find yourself in is a conundrum fraught with peril."
166,"I never consider this but this actually what happened for me.  Around 24/25 I just stopped caring about what people think.  I started doing what made me happy, which in turn lead to me starting to care about myself more.  Started dressing nicer and going to the gym.  Once this happened I started going out socially and being more social with people.  Doing what made happy and giving up anxieties that made me worry what people think about me set me free.  Made it a lot easier to talk to women. Which lead to me meeting my wife and finding someone I want to be with everyday. "
167,"I guess not taking no for an answer?   

I've told this on reddit before, but basically - I wasn't interested, made that clear once. 

She was in my circle of friends and she acted mopey and bitchy around me, so much so my friends each had talks with me, asking why I was so mean to her and why I wasn't interested.   

She tried several more times, going for a kiss out of nowhere like three times, asking for hugs and so on.   

I even told her, it's not that she was hideous, I just hated her personality.   

That lasted me for some time (two years?), but it doesn't seem to have stuck for good - she has a ""boyfriend"", but would talk about breaking up with him in between normal conversation and then recently asked me out yet again.   

Well first of all, still no. And secondly - fucking break up with him for yourself, not because you'd have me lined up secretly."

- [Article from The Independent talking about it](
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/international-mens-day-2018-when-is-it-celebrate-men-mental-health-movember-a8639631.html)

&gt; The date coincides with the birthday of the father of Dr Jerome Teelucksingh, a doctor from Trinidad and Tobago who relaunched International Men’s Day in 1999.

Interesting that he ""relaunched it"". So I dug into Wikipedia a bit to find [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day). Turns out it's been a thing since 1992 (Neat! I had no idea).

&gt; The objectives of celebrating an International Men's Day, set out in ""The Six Pillars of International Men's Day"", include:

&gt; - focusing on men's and boys' health

&gt; - improving gender relations

&gt; - promoting gender equality

&gt; - and highlighting male role models. 

&gt; It is an occasion to highlight discrimination against men and boys and to celebrate their achievements and contributions, in particular for their contributions to community, family, marriage, and child care. The broader and ultimate aim of the event is to promote basic humanitarian values.

This year's theme is ""Positive Male Role Models"". It's pretty cliche to pick your own dad for this, and even though I never really got along great with him while growing up, a lot of my character comes from his honesty and integrity that he has displayed in his daily interactions with people - even when I would have considered them to be not deserving of it. Who is your positive male role model?

Another cool fact is that it is followed by Universal Children's Day, and that November is recognized internationally as Men's month.

It took a lot of time and effort, and none of this was **ever** because I wanted to be more dateable specifically, but I did realize that it would have the pleasant aftereffect of doing so.  This is what happened over time:

* Began to work my way out of crippling depression and anxiety, and started to accept that I may not be the worthless human garbage I once thought I was.

* Began to cut bad personal/communication/social habits, and started cultivating good ones.

* Dieted, joined a gym, adopted physical hobbies, lost weight, got less weak and inflexible.

* Started believing that I wasn't employment impaired and that I could progress towards more enjoyable and better-paying positions.

* Began to acknowledge and appreciate all of the many many friends that I have.

* Started to be more casual with women that I met, rather than trying to secure a date with the ones I found attractive as early as possible.  If we had a good conversation and never saw each other again, cool.  If we saw each other some and we became just friends, cool.  If we saw each other some and ended up dating, cool.  It's all cool.  There's no real failure or loss in any of this.  I should be happy single like I should be happy in a relationship anyway.

All of this is work in progress, of course.  There have been many ups and many downs.  There have been many backslides.  But all in all, I'm doing much better than I used to, and so long as I keep the right mindset, I'll keep making progress.

205,"&gt; Yeah it does sound like a cliche.

It's not a cliche man. People are given advice on this sub all the time but with negative mindsets like this you just mock it. Being happy on your own means living the life you want to live. Does your career make you unhappy? That needs to be fixed, you cant spend a third of your day miserable and enjoy life. Are you in bad shape? Well you need to healthy and workout so you dont look and feel like shit. Are you isolated? You have to make an effort to maintain friendships and forge new ones. Are you depressed? Why? You need to treat the depression and root causes. Do you have  a productive hobby? A sport, dance, art, craft, bird watching, photography etc.? If not you need one, hobbies are for the soul. If you're spending most of your free time on the computer or gaming, isolated or abusing substances then you will not enjoy your life. Noone knows what a good life looks like for you. You have to decide what that is for yourself. Like he said no woman is going to save you. You have to save yourself. Once you are in a good place mentally, emotionally, physically and financially dating becomes 100x easier. If you think you cant be happy single then you are externalizing your happiness to other people. That is not sustainable.

210,"The first time played in snow was when i was 18 when a freak snow storm hit. But by the time I woke up it had mostly melted just enough to make a crappy snowman.

Last winter it snowed again, first time I ever saw it coming down and it was enough for a crunch sound when stepped on. I was with my SO and I told her ""oh, is that what snow sounds like when you step in it?"" She freaked out and said ""IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME IN SNOW?!""

For some reason, I said yes, and she said it made her very happy that she got to experience my first snow day with me. I brushed it off and thought ""well this makes her happy so I'll keep it to myself"". But oh man, she has told that story enthusiastically more than once, and how honored she was to experience such a crucial moment in my life. No pun intended, I thought I was in deep and only getting deeper with this lie. 

I recently came clean about it and we had a good laugh (after feeling anxious she was going to feel betrayed). This was after a year of keeping up the lie. "

What *does* bother me is when his gay acquaintances aggressively hit on me, or try to ""turn"" me (I'm straight). Look, it's not because someone's gay that I won't but flattered by a compliment, that's totally fine - what's *not* fine is the fact that some people don't understand that ""no"", means ""*no*"".

By how they talk I get the feeling they are afraid she will ""turn into a gay"" if she plays with ""boy toys""
I found this out because she told me once when coming home from her aunt and uncle's house that she shouldn't play with toy cars because ""that's for boys""
I was livid and just calmly explained that there is no such thing as boy toys or girl toys, that there are just toys and all kids are allowed to play with what whatever they like.

241,"Wasn't my husband, but I decided to cut the lawn for my father-in-law. We're living with them temporarily, and he seldom has time. The grass had gotten rather long, so I took it upon myself to learn how to use his lawn mower. I also had to gut out all the cemented on grass underneath, since it was causing the mower to stall.

Well, after hours of it... He said nothing to me, and just later told my husband that the next time I do a job, I should finish it. Apparently not weedwacking two acres and then blowing it off the driveway in the heat of August was all he could focus on.

Guess who's never cutting grass for him again? "

Runs a social campaign to get him thrown out of friend group for almost a year. We have all known him for 6 years and her a year, most of us aren't interested in her drama.

We ask her what he did during the breakup that was so bad. ""He said he didn't want to see me romantically anymore... Me! Who does he think he is? He's an asshole!"" 

""Okay, dumping someone isn't fun, but if he isn't that into you romantically, how was he supposed handle it?""

""I'm better than him, he should have wanted to keep dating me. He's a fucking asshole!""

""Was he mean when he dumped you?"" 

""He dumped me, that IS mean.""

He remained totally kind and civil but she just milked it. She still does. 4 years later. Every now and then she makes some passive aggressive comment about it while torturing whoever she is currently dating by being overly sensitive and cruel to them when it suits her. He dodged a bullet. In her mind, she was un-dumpable. Anyone who would dare is wrong and bad. She's not bright or emotionally stable. I avoid her at all costs. Last I heard when was torturing another mutual friend.

252,"I happen to be a feminist and was unaware that International Men's Day was a thing. So happy International Men's Day! 

Since there may be others who are unaware of this day, as I was, here's a helpful wiki link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day

The six pillars of International Men's Day sound great to me! I think that promoting better knowledge of men's and boy's health (especially sexual and mental health which is largely ignored), improving gender relations, promoting gender equality, and highlighting male role models is fantastic! As a young girl my role model was my Zaidy because he was a good business owner who cared about his customers like family. He's the one who inspired me to work hard to get a career I care about enough to never retire from and I'm well on my way to accomplishing this. He was always proud of his grandchildren and wanted his granddaughters to be as strong as his grandsons. I've been thinking about him a lot lately and I'm so glad that there's a group who decided to found a day to remember male role models, like my Zaidy, and remember that men are as important to gender equity as women, trans-individuals, and non-binary folks. 

I'm sure there are some insane newbie 3rd wave feminists screaming at the internet today, but please don't let their irrational anger sully your opinion of feminism at large. I am a feminist and I like to think that I can be an ally to men. "

You meet, you have some fun and are generally compatible, you hook up, maybe go out once a week or on the weekend, see a show, drinks, but after a month or maybe two, you start to feel less attracted to them as neither of you are on your best behaviour anymore. Little annoyances start to show, different ideas of satisfaction, goals, various red flags pop up, or maybe don't, and you realise you'd rather just head home after work and chill out than go out of your way to see them, even if it means you'd probably end up sleeping with them, which a month ago you'd have taken an Uber across town to do at 2am. So you find excuses for why you're busy but after a while you just admit you don't feel like it will go somewhere and then people feel bad even though it's not their fault. The end. "

276,"The last time I rejected a girl, over a year ago, it didn't go so well. I kinda liked her friend, but her friend wasn't feeling it. The girl I turned down started talking to me about her friend, whom I liked and as I opened up a little about it, she told me she liked me.

I told her, in these exact words, ""Well I'm really flattered, but I'm sorry, I don't share those feelings."" This was all via text, so she simply responded with ""LOL okay I've got it."" Seemed like that was that.

I met her and her friend at this weekly thing I go to, so one way or another I was going to run into them. I said my hi/byes when I saw them but didn't intend on hanging around with them for too long, but the girl I turned down called me over, introduced me to one of her guy friends, and then goes, ""You know what Aldairion said when I told him I liked him? 'Pfffft, that's nice. Next!'"" So I just make a face and say, ""You know that's not what I said,"" to which she replied, ""Relaaaaxxx I'm just joking. Jeez, go rain on someone else's parade."" Maybe I just don't understand her humor. 

Her friend, whom I liked, later texted me chewing me out about ""being such a huge jerk."" I think I dodged a couple of bullets there.

I know (very well, in fact) what it's like to get rejected by someone you're into, so I tried to be as sensitive as possible, but there's no winning with some people. If anything, it's made me a little more empathetic towards women who've ghosted on me rather than explicitly turning me down. I don't condone it, but I at least understand how verbally rejecting someone can be tough.

281,"I'm twenty-one, and it wasn't until my most recent relationship that I finally realized some of the *obvious lies* my parents told me (in good humor, I'm sure). Here are the ones I can remember off the top of my head:

* My dad didn't know it was his wedding day when he was married.
* My parents never dated - my mom moved in and ""just never moved out"".
* My dad invented the breadstick.
* My dad knows ""THE"" Rocky Rococo. 
* Childhood cat ran away because he didn't like taking his medicine.

I'm sure there were more... but these are the ones I remember at the moment. You might be surprised at what your kid blindly believes if you're the one who told him."

They will purposefully pick up and destroy each other's toys. They will hold grudges for days or weeks. Mine are still little, but I'm dreading the teenage years when they hold grudges for *years*. 

But when they know I'm watching or listening, they're sweet angels to each other. I don't understand."

285,"My parents broke up when I was a baby and I lived with my Mom. I stayed with my Dad weekends. Despite this, I still say that my Dad raised me. My Mom was neglectful and abusive (not to my Dad's knowledge, because I grew up with it, I thought it was normal, and I genuinely was a clumsy kid, so me being bruised was normal).

As an adult, I realise that my Mom used to badmouth my Dad to me when I was growing up, because she wanted to turn me against him, because she hated that I loved him so much. 

When I realised how abusive and toxic she was (along with the fact that she was an alcoholic), I finally told my Dad about everything she put me through. He never spoke to her again. Then she died, and because she had no money, it would be down to me to pay for it. So my Dad paid for it. He said it was worth it for her to finally be out of our lives. 

Long story short, I love my Dad. He's my best friend. We might not get along all the time because we're so fucking similar. But he's always there for me. I'm nearly 30 and I go see him Friday nights and we game together. I will say no to going out partying, because I'd rather stay in playing Borderlands 2 with my Dad."

300,"So the biggest change in my view on women I learned from a coworker, not my daughter. 

There was a girl I worked with who got into trouble. I ended up vouching for her to keep her job. Somehow, in my head, I got it that pretty, nice girls could really do no wrong. No, I wasn’t trying to sleep with this woman, ‘cause that’s what you’re all wondering. 

Anyway, she ended up getting in trouble again and I learned that women really are just the same as us. They don’t need protection, or rescuing, or coddling, or anything of the sort. They need a path to do their own thing. I lost a bit of credibility in the learning process, but all in all I came out a better, wiser, person. 

As far as my daughter does she taught me that sometimes people adhere to stereotypes no matter what. I made a point of giving her a lot of options, power rangers vs Barbie, blue vs pink clothes, unicorn or race car, etc. I wasn’t trying to make her a tomboy, but just giving her the space to grow into the woman she wants to be without anyone pidgeon holing her into “woman can’t do *thing*”

Why hold onto that for so long?

I'm in HR and speak to pretty much the whole company on a regular basis, but here's the background: a few months back when I was new, my girlfriend met this girl at a work event. I was so new that I didn't remember her name, so rather than make an introduction I dodged a conversation. My girlfriend doesn't think that I'm cheating, but that im having some inappropriate conversation with a girl that was messaging for work reasons.

Kids are just weird and all develop at different rates and by the time they’re like 4 nobody even cares at what rate they learned or did anything. I honestly can’t stand being around new parents because they are always so obsessed with did little Timmy learn to say every vegetable by picking it up and saying the name when grocery shopping?

Everyone was like what. We just blankly stared. Someone asked her to clarify. She repeated very suredly. ""June bugs don't have eyes."" Her dad said so when she was little. Someone actually caught one and held it up to her in the light so she could get a closer look. Her world came crashing down around her.... a few weeks later, we were eating lunch with her dad. She turned to her dad, stone cold, while he was mid-sandwich bite. ""Dad, why did you tell me when I was little that June bugs don't have eyes?"" He nearly choked. He asked her what she was talking about. But he knew. She asked him again. ""Oh I didn't tell you that, that was your brother"". She insisted it wasn't. Meanwhile, I am holding back all the laughter. He was trying so hard to slip out of his web of lies but she caught him. "

So every year we do a hearing test and every year if i dont hear a beep after 3 seconds i just click the button.

This last 4 years my right side report has shown an increase in hearing in my right ear, so they sent me to a specialist to get a more randomized testing. I told the doctor when safety wasnt in the room and he understood my plight, helping me by rasing his hand while i was in the booth when he returned.

My wife knows, everyone else thinks im a terrible listener."

""Why doesn't someone who lives close by offer you to switch their shift with yours?""

""Because they like getting off work earlier just as much as I would""

""Well they should give it to you because you need it the most and they're supposed to be your friends""

""Err no babe they're just work colleagues, as you know I spend most of the time outside work at home with you and the people I work with I don't want to be friends with""

328,"Many years ago, I was in a new relationship with a woman who I thought was head and shoulders above any woman I've dated in a while so decided I wanted to see only her. Within a month of us dating, I went to a wedding overseas with a lifelong friend. This was planned well before I met the new girl. The lifelong friend was super cool, understanding, and genuinely happy I met someone. The wedding weekend was going awesome until I was introduced to a girl.... Let's call her K. 
K apparently becomes insta infatuated with me. She asks my friend all about me, who am I, what I do, where I live, etc. During the wedding and the entire weekend, she keeps getting closer and closer to me, talking, making conversation, etc. The night of the wedding, I went outside to get some air and she follows...... She asks about my relationship status and I tell her that I've been seeing someone that I really like. Well K gives no fucks and asks me to kiss her, wants to see me once we get back to America, etc to which I decline. K THEN tells my friend after everyone is back in America that she got my number from me but lost it and could she get it, to which my friend gives her. This sets off an entire chain of shit show events that blows my mind. First it was a text, then adding as friends on social media, then randomly being in the city I live in on ""business"", etc. I had nothing to hide as I considered her a friend and I had done nothing wrong with K. 
One night, she is in my city again with friends. She invites me out and I agree. K and her friends then decide to pull out their phones, look up my significant other, and totally trash her to my face. Saying she isnt pretty enough for me, im ""dating down"", K is prettier, blah blah blah. I kindly ask them ""well where are your boyfriends.....since you are all such great catches?"" This causes a table full of entitled bitches to suddenly hate me. I excuse myself and leave. 
That night.....I get pages of threats via text. Threats to tell my significant other whom ive been seeing for a while now that K and I have been sleeping together, including at the wedding. She tells me she is going to ruin my relationship and portray herself as some victim. She includes that her entire table of girlfriends are gonna be in on it and they hate me. Needless to say, she did not. This was years ago. Im now happily married to the woman I started dating, we have a beautiful family. We have professional careers, travel the world, and are madly in love. K on the other hand, is eclipsing 40, has put on immense weight, has no prospects, and I sometimes hear rumblings that I was the one that got away from her (although I was never hers to begin with). The table of bitches have all remained single although some of them are single moms now. What amazes me through that entire debacle is the attitude of ""how dare YOU reject ME"" and the sheer nastiness of all of them working together. "

330,"He wasn't specific really. I pictured him and his wife having a spontaneous kiss in the kitchen or something, not getting full blown down and dirty."
331,6 years ago my little girl was having a rough time after finding out her grandmothers cat had passed away (she was close with the cat).  The day she got the word I walked into her room and found her hamster dead.  I did not want to add to her stress so I decided to swap it out with a new hamster that looked almost identical before she got home from school.  
332,"Reminds me of a time when I saw this kid get into in one of those on-the-beach-drainage pools with the big pipe and water underneath that just drains to the beach. I when in a grabbed him, pulled him out, and sorta gave him a lesson not to swim in places near drains where it's not safe. Never saw the parents but I think the kid got a good lesson from me. Probably looked way different if there were people watching me be slightly harsh to this kid. "
333,"The moment I held my daughter for the first time I instantly regretted the way I had treated woman in the past, because I knew in that moment that if anyone had to ever hurt my baby I could quite easily put them 6 feet under without blinking.

336,"I respect the fuck out of this.  

That's kind've always been my view of marriage, despite the more popular, cynical sentiment.  I've always said if I get divorced, I'm done forever.  I would feel so phony saying that shit again.

If you say those words, you better mean them.  A man is only as good as his word.

If you mean it in the way of we're sexually active but we are not together:

1. Don't wanna fuck this up with feelings, having sex is amazing.

2. I don't think that it'll work out between us.

If you mean it in the way of there's this girl at work and we're a little flirty:

Mostly insecurities, and just not wanting to make things weird and possibly going through the struggle of rejection.

All I can say is if you want something from him, just say it. You might not get the response you'd like, but you won't have to ponder the issue anymore."

369,"So, after all that info, you were never curious/interested enough to watch it? Forget everything you know about it and watch it with fresh eyes. I think it's a movie everyone should experience at least once. "
370,"Aahhhh. This makes my head hurt. I have repeatedly told myself my husband is his own person and does things differently than I do. It’s really hard living with someone. You have to learn real quick that criticizing you SO for something stupid, like, how they arrange the dishes in the dishwasher, is a quick way to get them to quit doing it. Ever. My sister was criticized for not mowing the lawn perfectly and she hasn’t done it in 15 years. 

Pick your battles, folks. Pick them wisely. Be pleasant. Don’t project your shit day onto our SO. If they fold the laundry and put it away all jacked up, thank them! If you can’t find the measuring cup because they put it away wrong, don’t even mention it. Thank them for showing you where it was. I’ve only been married for four years, but I tried to learn this quickly. I need help around this house and imma take it, however it gets done. "
371,"That's an expensive lesson for everyone to learn
 LOL 

I have cashmere sweaters and never put them in with the regular laundry, not because I'm worried about my husband throwing them in the washer, but because it's more likely that I'd be the dumbass to throw them in the washer. The dry-cleaning goes into a separate laundry basket. "
372,"As someone who has a sister and used to fight a lot as well (we’re best buddies now so no worries). I think that it would be a lot more helpful if my dad would have taken the time to understand the reason behind the fight rather than just telling us not to fight. In my opinion, it would have been a lot helpful if my parents understood and had given us logical reasons as to understand the other sister’s perspective.

It’s also important to see different moments where you favor one daughter over the other and you need to make sure that they both know that they’re equally valuable to you. 

Hope this helps in some way. "

375,"Met a very nice women around a month ago. Our 3rd date was last weekend. 3rd. Date. She tells me she is in love with me. Now, I just got out of something I thought was going to lead to marriage not 4 months ago. When we started seeing each other I explained that I was just open to dating, nothing serious, explained my situation. I was very open and honest about it. 

She tells me shes in love with me. Again, 3rd date. I was very nice in explaining that I was not ready for anything serious. She begged for more from me. I'm in no shape to give it. She starts to get very angry. Tells me I'm trash for leading her on. Still in love with my ex. I tell her that she is right, a large part of me is in fact still in love with her. 

She leaves, and sends a barrage of texts and calls. Not very nice things were spoken, I just took it, she needed to get it out. Then it got really nasty, so I had to block her on everything. 3. Dates. "

She's not planning on staying much longer at our job, and I thought maybe I could ask her out once she leaves, but I get the sense even though we've gotten close as friends, she'll reject me.  There are days that I feel her and I have a strong connection, and she may like me more than she's letting on (she's very shy and suffers from social anxiety), as she tells me a lot about her life, including a lot of private things she says she sharing only with me.  And then there are days where it feels like she is purposely avoiding me.

Between that and a lifetime of rejection, I have zero confidence to ask her out if and when she or I leave the company.  Most likely after she's gone, I'll never see or hear from her ever again."
379,"&gt; They come painted the same color as the car from the factory. If the paint is chipping, or it looks like there's been a wrench on them, that could indicate that bodywork was done on the car and the panel has either been readjusted or replaced.

Worked at a body shop for years.  To add on to this, open the hood and check the seals that seal the joints of the interior panels.  They look like giant beads of caulk, usually an inch in size.  If the car has had major work done on one side, the way the new seals look will be different from the factory seals.  That's another way to tell if major body work has been done."

After dinner, she invited me to her place

Be clear, don’t be weird about it, and give her the old “Ive really loved getting to know you. Now that we don’t work together, do you want to go out on a date?”

Be ready to accept either response and don’t overthink it, but definitely do something :)"

392,"One thing I've noticed is that men in this society are not considered to have any inherent worth of their own. They only have worth based on what they achieve, and what they own.

Which is why the stereotype of the naggy wife, who constantly tells the husband how he could/should/would be doing everything better is so toxic. Because what she's in essence doing is removing the one thing he gets some kind of merit for. 

People concentrate on the ""you have a small dick"" taunt but if you translate that to its core it's ""you aren't getting this particular job done"". "

One day she gave me a little heart sticker, but it must’ve fallen off during the day and I didn’t realize it until she asked me about it as I was picking her up from daycare.  I was too cowardly to tell her I lost it, so in a panic I told her a bird swooped down and stole it.  I figured that would be the end of it but she asked me about it the whole way home, so I had to elaborate my lie.  She’s 4 now and she still asks about it and has a complex about birds stealing her stickers."

Didn’t bother knocking on the door, she hopped the fence and came to the windows outside my bedroom and became knocking on them. The thing is, I wasn’t home. I had walked to a New Years party at a friend’s place right down the street. I planned on drinking so why bother driving? Anywho, after I didn’t come to my bedroom window or respond to her attempts to get me to the front door after her window trick didn’t work, she got in her car, drove to a mutual friend’s place and when she saw our friend kissing her boyfriend goodnight, the crazy girl decided to gun her accelerator and slammed her vehicle into the boyfriend’s vehicle and totaled both cars. 
When I woke up the next morning I had text messages from our mutual friend asking why I never let the rejected girl into my house, I had to explain that I wasn’t home and left my phone on its charger in my room. She then proceeded to inform me of what had happened. "

Nevertheless, she still believes me and likes pointing out pink and red things. I almost messed up once because I had forgotten about that lie. Oh and yeah, I did it to be different.

My wife is insecure about her appearance, so it made her mad. Fuming angry. At me. "

Being harsh to kids and talking in a stern voice to them makes you look more like a responsible adult than a pedophile I think.

437,"Had a similar problem with my older brother. Once asked what was in a hot dog (mistake, I know). Well, he goes on a long story how the cafeteria collects all the food out of the garbage at the end of the day, grinds it up, and serves it every Friday. (Friday was hot dog day at our elementary school) I went a solid 4 years where I wouldn’t even touch a hotdog. To this day, still feel a little weird every time I have one, and I only eat the ones labeled all-beef just in case. "
438,"She was mad that I went to bed later than her, like I have for the last 5 years of our relationship. 

I don't get it, I still follow through on my obligations, I spend time with her, I just want some alone time. "
439,"Yesterday was my last day off before I work at least one shift every day for the next 8 days. My girlfriend, who I live with, wanted to take this opportunity to get a Christmas tree. We both had class that day until about 4 PM, and agreed to meet at the mall near my school. It had been a long day, but I was looking forward to some time with her. 

In my area, it’s still a bit early for Christmas trees and not many places have them. I pointed out that we still needed a stand, and needed to find out where to get one as well as the tree itself. This came off as pessimism in her eyes, and it dampened her mood greatly. To be fair, I hadn’t eaten since before noon, and I was a little brain dead after my 3 hour lab. So I very well could’ve come off as less than enthusiastic. Also, her father was supposed to come out with his SUV to help with the tree and have dinner with us.

By the time we had bought a stand and found the only place that had trees, her father called and had to bail because the traffic was too bad. It was late, I was becoming hangry, and my girlfriend was very discouraged by the fact that we were facing so many hurdles. This culminated into a fight about how I wasn’t as nearly as excited as her, and how I never indulge the things she wants to do. She pointed out that she’s been excited for a tree since we moved in together in August, and how I knew that and still couldn’t put forth anything resembling enthusiasm. She was somewhat right in this, as I’ve been struggling with depression for the past few months. I’ve been making progress, but it’s slow going and I’m unable to see a professional due to my financial situation. She is extremely supportive, as she has also had her struggles, and I would be much worse without her but it’s begun taking a toll on our relationship

We ended up not getting a tree, and she drove home. I sat in the parking lot of Lowe’s in my car for about half an hour just trying to piece the day back together in my head. She eventually drove back up to my car, said she was sorry and told me to come home and eat. Which I did, and we talked it out a bit more. Eventually she wanted to just move past it, so I went to bed early. 

It’s been a rough couple of months. Between us both going to school and me working as much as possible to be able to pay for my expenses, I haven’t been as emotionally available for her, and she’s tired of it. She knows what I’m going through, but she’s getting impatient, as any normal human would. I’m trying as hard as I can to get better, but it still feels like it’s not enough to smooth things out. Today’s a new day though, and I’m not gonna let last night keep me down. "
440,I slept for 6 hours after a 12 hour night shift. This was too long and i should have realised this in my sleep and woken myself up.
441,"Yeah, having a daughter teaches one to think of women as other humans with slightly different life experiences? Better late than never."
442,"I donated over the course of a year while I lived in Boston.  Between 2009 and 2010.

I started the process never thinking that I'd be accepted.  There was a HUGE packet that I had to fill out that asked about nearly everything imaginable.  The majority of it was on my health (mental and physical)  and of my immediate and extended family.  Then, towards the end it just got weird.  There were questions like ""Do you share any quirks of popular cartoon characters"" and ""If you could have lunch with anyone of the same sex, who would it be?""

Surprisingly, I was accepted.   At the time, I was a postdoc at Harvard Medical School and was 29/30.  I'm African American, so maybe they needed some diversity.  I have a history of depression, but was still accepted.  The other guys that walked in all looked like Chris Hemsworth to me.  I definitely wasn't on their level of attractiveness in my mind.

I was paid $100.00 per donation and I made 100 donations over the course of that year.  I'd go every Monday and Friday morning.  They asked that I not ejaculate for 2 nights before each donation.  I was in a long distance relationship at the time, so it kinda worked out well.

I believe that they capped the number of children that I can have at 10.  I worry that they'll meet each other and date one day.

The money was invaluable to me.  I was getting paid nearly nothing and had student loans.  It made a huge difference.

A couple things to note.  First, the sperm bank said that there was only one characteristic that they didn't accept in men: &gt;!red hair.!&lt;  Why?  Simply because there wasn't any demand for it.  I always thought that was interesting.  Second, I developed this weird attraction to the women who worked there.  I guess it was a Pavlovian thing.  Finally, there has been one woman who refused to date me because of it.  She was worried about family dynamics in the future.  That was tough.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'd like to add that, at the end of the packet, they asked whether or not it'd be ok if your offspring contact you when they are 18.  I went back and forth on this a couple of times before watching a movie called The Kids Are Alright.  Then, I stuck with allowing them to contact if me they wanted."
443,Just tell her not to buy things she doesn’t need 
444,That was really careless and irresponsible of you. 
445,"and scared to death of women

"
446,"I can't believe you would let her feel unwell like that, you're a monster!"
447,"We had a late loss (22 weeks) earlier this year.  My two cents:


1.  Deal with your shit.  If you need to see a counselor or something, do it.  It will likely comfort her if she knows you are taking care of yourself and help you to communicate with her about it.

2.  This may last longer than you expect, and it will also likely get better and then resurface.  Expect holidays this year to be tough, as well as the due date, anniversary of miscarriage, baby showers and pregnancy announcements.  You will notice newborns and pregnant women for awhile and it may hurt unexpectedly."
448,"&gt; Why hold onto that for so long? 

She knew it was right, but didn't like it. Conflicted but she tried to maintain the friendship anyway."
449,That I know what the helium doing. I’m almost 70. 
450,Something like 2% of kids have the disease. We just have to draw dicks. It's an illness 
451,"Why's that, I need a clearer explanation for one of my friends, he doesn't get it. "
452,"I don't have a daughter, but I had a similar experience witnessing my sister going through a bad relationship. "
453,"About 5 months after moving into a new place, I heard my neighbor call me “Chris”. That is not my name. Not even close. I let it slide because I wasn’t sure. Same neighbor was talking to my wife and referred to me as “Chris” during the convo. She was confused and wasn’t completely sure they meant me. This was in November. We got a Christmas card from them with a gift card for a restaurant...addressed to “Chris and (my wife’s name)”. Fuck. We were stuck. We couldn’t figure out a way to tell them without hurting their feelings or making them feel bad. This went on for 6 years. We went to dinner with them. Shared bbq parties. Went to concerts, sports venues, etc. For 6 years I was Chris to them. I have no fucking idea how it was never brought up by someone else, but they never said a word and neither did we. We moved pretty far away a couple of years ago and lost touch, but every once in a while my wife will give me a birthday card or something made out to “Chris”. "
454,"Did my wifes laundry for a while. I never shrunk anything, as I am very careful not to shrink my painters pants. A dress of hers (which I was very fond of the way it hugged her curves) went missing. Sucked into the void as a sacrifice to the lint gods no doubt. For 2 years it was one thing I would never live down. How could you lose a whole dress, when we are lucky enough to have laundry capability in our own home? She found it in the back of her closet when we were tearing out the carpet."
455,"Had a drink thrown on me in public 

Slapped in public 

Screamed at in public "
456,No wonder you people are socially awkward.
457,"This is the first comment that actually takes the friendship in account. You can't tell your BF that his kids are monsters. It will truly hurt his feelings. Don't take the advice of those saying ""he's your BF then you should tell it like it is"". I suspect none of them has children so they wouldn't know what it means to be told something like this. Not all truths need to be voiced."
458,One time I woke up for school and  started realizing how weird it felt so I check the time and turns out it's 12:34 AM and I'm in the shower. I quickly get out and go back to bed. My dad then checks on my shower and he sees it's been used. A few weeks later he tells me he thinks there's a ghost using my shower. I never told him it was really me for about a decade. He also told all his friends and they believed him. 
459,[deleted]
460,"There's two sides to every story so here's my guess: No, he has a wooden bat with ""morning"" written on it to defend against home invaders. She obviously thought he was going to beat her with it for kissing him. A very reasonable fear, if you ask me!"
461,"Starting today I'll have to maintain a lie about a friend / colleague's death.

He took the last two days off with a ""migraine"". He was secretly depressed and in emotional pain having lost his girlfriend to cancer earlier this year and his house mate found him a few hours ago, having committed suicide.

The two days he took off combined with some time he took a few weeks ago was straining the relationship with our client where he was outsourced to the point that if he didn't show up tomorrow they were cancelling his PO.

Tomorrow we have to go and tell the client that wanted to fire him off site that he died. We're not going to tell them he committed suicide, we're going to spare his dignity and tell a white lie that he passed suddenly, likely an aneurysm (believable due to the migraine story)

  
"
462,"I feel like it's important to point out International Men's Day is still sort of new. (Starting in early 90s) And isn't fully viewed as a international holiday as just a professor of Tennessee made it up on his father's birthday. This is the big thing.  Technically it's not even a national holiday for the US.

International woman's Day had an organization push for it to be legitly viewed as a national holiday (Woman's day) and it did by 1917 and moved from there.  (By 1975 it became viewed as an international holiday.)

Now does that mean people should ignore it? No. But you have to understand the weight of this. If we want Men's Day to be accepted we need to use it what it was originally for and spend less time focusing on a Google doodle. We have to start by making it a national holiday and moving from there. And we have to make it clear that Men's Day is meant not to undermine Women's day but to focus on many toxic masculinity that exist and harms men. (Not showing emotions, being always strong, having to make the most, being the bread winner, etc) "
463,"My ex used to do this all the time.  We were together for almost 3 years, but when I was at work, if I hadn't texted her by 9 or 10am I would get a ""Hello???"" or ""Are you alive?"" text.  Made my blood boil.  I told her how much I didn't like it and asked her to stop.  It did not."
464,"For the most part attention seeking behaviour isn't gender specific, but I've noticed at least some differences (all anecdotal of course).

Attention seeking men will often use 'bravado' and social boundary pushing behaviour to get attention. This covers anything from simply trying to be the loudest person in the group, to intentionally pushing buttons in order to get a reaction out of their peers. I've also noticed that they'll tend to threaten doing something reckless in order to get the whole group's attention, which is mostly just telling them ""don't do it you idiot.""

Attention seeking Women tend to create scenarios where they require help and attention from their friends. They'll get involved with some drama, often escalate it with their own behaviour, then use that to gain sympathy and affection from their peers. They'll refuse to learn from their mistakes as this will lead to further drama and therefore attention.

"
465,"Oh my God. I might have a solution for you! I just read an article about how a guy found out he had a child with an ex. So he would see the kid every now and again when the ex would allow it. Until one day the ex started denying the kid ever existed. So the guy is obviously tweaking probably thinking she murdered the kid. WELP. it turns out for years she had been using a kid she babysat and pretending like it was their kid to get the guy to send her money.

So basically, just tell them you found out it was all a lie, she was using her friends baby or something, and you're devastated and never wanna talk about it again. Etc etc. Might even get a couple days off.

Edit: I've tried extensively to find the link to the story but haven't been able to find it. If anyone is, please let me know!"
466,"Today I fucked up by depositing money?

(Not today) I fucked up by marrying a girl who's father is a dick?"
467,"Toy toolset. It’s basically an excuse to give them a hammer they’ll use to hit your brother with.

470,"Don't you remember Thunderhead? Stratogale? Metaman? Dynaguy? Splashdown? 

NO CAPES."
471,"The most common reaction I've gotten was them getting pissed and proceed to do everything they could to ignore me. A few told me I had to fix my confidence, a couple got angry and called me a fucking idiot, and one told me ""you're a man, you're not allowed to say no."""
472,Thats an intense commitment 
473,"my girlfriend keeps receipts for literally everything. I dont keep a single one longer than until I pass the first trashcan. I asked her what she does with them, she says ""keep them in a box of receipts."" yeah but what do you end up doing with them? ""I just said, keep them in a box."" ok then"
474,11/10 decision making
475,"She's at the store, I just barely got home.  On the phone:

""What kind of cheese do you want?""

""Monterey Jack.""

""I'm going to get Mozzarella""

""But I said Monterey Jack""

""They don't have the Mozzarella on sale, is this too much cheese to buy?""

""You can always freeze the cheese""

""No you can't""

""Yes you can""

""No, it gets all wet and watery"" (?!)

""Ok""

""What does that mean?""

""If that's what you think then alright""

""Well I'm getting cheddar, what kind do you want, sharp, medium, or heavy?""

""Heavy""

""I'm gonna get sharp""

*tells me about things she's seeing in the store followed by me saying ""oh cool"" or ""sure get that"" or ""I've never tried that before"", etc.*

""I'm just gonna hang up, you're not being helpful"" *hangs up*

She got mad because I couldn't see what was in the store through the phone.  Don't understand why she asks me what I want if she doesn't end up getting it anyway."
476,"Any time a woman expresses a preference that doesn't apply to the man who hears it, he will probably feel at least a little insecure unless he has literally 0 attraction toward her. Now you can't go around censoring yourself, but a good rule of thumb is that even if you're going to say what you like, try not to trash people who aren't that. A lot of women like tall guys, and that's fine, but it doesn't do if they make jokes about short guys etc. Just express your preferences as kindly as possible, when you need to."
477,Story of my life. Dry humor and people cannot always tell when I am joking and I make shit up all the time. At least I get a good laugh.

481,"I have 2 daughters, one's 6 and one's 2, and another daughter on the way in March. I fear for them. The world isn't a nice place for women. Before I had kids it didn't occur to me how I was making a woman feel by looking at or trying to hit on her. Dave Chappelle (that famous philosopher) once told how he got paid $20k in cash for doing a gig and got on the subway home feeling like everyone knew and wanted to take it from him. He said that for those 2 hours, he understood what it must feel like to be a woman. I don't want my girls to ever feel like that. I don't want someone like me 10 years ago, whether they're just ignorant or malicious, to make my girls feel like they have something everyone wants that can be taken by force at anytime. "
482,"I was once waiting my girlfriend to come out from the lady's bathroom in a party, this girl at the other side of the room thought I was looking at her (while I was actually staring firmly at the opposite wall, because I was incredibly wasted). She came over and already started holding me, it took a moment for me to realize what was really happening, but then I said to her: ""Oh  sorry, but I am with my girlfriend, just waiting for her to come out."" She yelled ""Fuck You"" and then left.

Few moments later, now with my girlfriend, a security guard approaches me telling that I was causing trouble and was invited to leave the party. To not create trouble, I said okay and started leaving, but my girlfriend insisting that nothing happened; as I head towards the exit, the same girl from before is standing there, pointing her finger at me, the guard asks: ""Is this the guy that was assaulting you?"", and she confirms, ""I'm gonna call the police then"", the guard proceeded to say.

At that point, neither my girlfriend or me understood what was happening, and I of course was denying what happened.

Fast forward, we ended up at the security room of the nightclub, to look at the tapes, the girl was already creating excuses that they shouldn't see the tapes, that they should already call the cops. Then the tapes showed what really happened, the girl was kicked out, and I ended up the night hugged with the toilet at the party."

498,"Pretty much the same here. I’ve never really had a bad time with women, but around 22-23 I lost all shame, and expectations with things. Now I just say and do whatever regardless if it makes me look good or bad. Women seem to like it or find it endearing. I say and do things on dates that my friends couldn’t even comprehend doing and it had always worked for me. I also do things that I think are funny even though I know they probably won’t. "

507,"Ah that seems a lot more understandable imo. I mean it’s obviously no less confusing for you in real time I’m sure, it’s never easy getting unexpected friction in response to a thoughtful/good intention. But tbf there’s probably a solid baseline of ambient confusion and weirdness about that whole situation for her too. Idk either way I hope you guys have a fun New Years.  "
508,"I'm surprised they didn't even come up with some obscure under water basket weaver's birthday to arbitrarily commemorate on some kind of diversity basis. It's just plain ""Google""."
509,"That last line, seriously. I’d love to tell one of my best friends how awful it is to be around her kids, but it would end the friendship because it would be a massive insult to her parenting (rightfully so, she has no idea how to keep them in line). Add to that she’s not one who takes any constructive feedback well. 

If she lived near me it would be a deal breaker. Fortunately I only see them once or twice a year. Still have to contort things to not have them over to my house and limit my time with her, which stinks. "
510,"The blokes from work, as I was a painter called Matt used to call me Matt black as my full name. As in the paint.

One day one of the high-end security officers called me to one side and couldn’t understand why I went by two names.

After enquiring what he meant, he asked why I’m called Matt black and where did my nickname (surname) come from. I just laughed and said it’s one of those things and he continued calling me Matt

The child isn’t inherently evil, but certain behaviours can be very destructive and hard to be around, it’s completely understandable to not want to deal with those behaviours, but it makes a big difference that you aren’t condemning the child (and by relation the parent who raised them) entirely and simply pointing out something specific that you can’t deal with.

I never explicitly said I was Jewish or wasn't Jewish I just answered quite neutral because I didn't want to offend him in his assumptions. It's been about a few years now and I've had to research some sayings and holidays so I know what he's talking about when I turn up for a check up.

I don’t feel like a pedo. I don’t act like a pedo. If you’re too worried about it then you actually come off as creepy. So just stop worrying?"

I've heard that so much. The most attractive thing to a woman is knowing that another woman approves the man. It's like a freaking credit card offer where you are pre-approved.

588,"I keep cocoa, cinnamon and powder chocolate recipents in my house, all looking alike.

I once told the son of a roomie that they were different types of chocolate which were magical, put some cocoa on an spoon and let him taste, telling him ""this chocolate will make you sneeze"" and he sneezed after tasting because thats a common reaction from children. Then cinnamon telling him ""this is spicy chocolate"", he tasted a little and yes was spicy. Finally for the sinker grabbed regular chocolate powder and told him ""this makes you laugh"" he tasted and since he was already convinced the other 2 were magical he started laughing.

To this day everytime he ask for chocolate milk I ask him ""the type that is spicy, the type which makes you sneeze or which makes you laugh?"" regardless of the answer I give him regular chocolate powder but its fun seeing him sticking his tongue out from the milk being too spicy."

591,"Before I met my SO, I was the typical ""I never want kids"" person. Spent most of my nights on drunk hookups at the bar. When I met my SO we went on a few abstinent dates (weird at first but felt right) to get to know eachother. I then met her kids 9F and 11M. They asked me to move in a few months later (was something I would never have considered a year before). Fast forward a year and a half and SO is pregnant. She was sick the entire time and on bed rest for 2 months. I was scared, unsure of myself, and unprepared even with all the reading and questioning I had done. As soon as my peanut was born it flipped my entire outlook on life. I'm more emotional than ever. More sensitive, caring, loving. She's my world. And my SO is a goddess in my eyes. She gave me something I never thought I wanted, and never knew I needed. Mothers should all be praised. That 9 months is forever life changing body and mind. 

P.S. my daughter is the shit."

594,"I have three that have gone a very long way in my relationship.

1) Figure out your partners love languages and try to do things that align with them.

2) It's never me vs her, it's always us vs the problem.

3) Love is not always easy or straightforward, it's a conscious choice that you have to make daily.

Theyre maybe not rules of thumb in the traditional sense, but they're definitely pieces of advice that have made my relationship and now marriage better. "
595,"Exactly my thoughts! Why can’t people be decent human beings before it impacts them directly? Like, you shouldn’t need to have a daughter/sister/whatever to realize women are people to. "

606,"Being glued to their phones; this applies to relationships, dates and even friends, but of course it matters more if I'm romantically invested. I feel rather crappy about losing to a small screen in priority.

I was also in a somewhat toxic relationship where my ex wouldn't shut up about her ex-bestie (male) who had cut all ties when we started dating as he was into her and she wasn't to him. As much as I wanted to keep my cool, constantly hearing how he was so funny, had such a great taste in music make me feel so insecure and needy that it took me years after the unavoidable breakup to regain even modicum of my self-worth and confidence back. I just didn't get the feeling that I was ""the best"" at anything other than supporting her (at my own health's expense in the end). I as a man also like to hear that I am sweet, funny, cool or something...that there are reasons why she is with me."

Speaking as a 30-year-old woman, in my experience that never really stops (and sometimes it even has a negative spin, e.g. coworkers me told me I was only hired because I was the manager's type, when in reality I was just a high performer with the metrics to prove it). Some people will always see you as a woman first rather than a three-dimensional person. It's a little depressing sometimes. "

To be honest I was complitely fronting. She lived far from me and I just wanted to try new things and get better at flirting. So we talked for a hour or 2 in the high speed train. By the time her station arrived I still haven't asked her for contact information. She stormed off, obviously pissed off. She was very pretty but I don't regret it at all. It was a little epiphany.

I always go about doing this as politely and diplomatically as possible. In restaurants, I ask to be seated away from any children, especially if they’re making noise. 
Some people think I’m being an asshole, but why should I pay for a meal to have it ruined by kids?

Tell your friend that you’d like to spend time with them by themselves. If there’s someone to look after the children, it shouldn’t be a problem. 

Unfortunately, I’m at the age where friends are starting to think about kids and honestly, I think I’m going to lose a few friends because of it. 

Like I say, I think as long as you’re polite and diplomatic, it shouldn’t be an issue. There’s no nice way to tell someone their children are horrible, noisy semen demons.

It didn't occur to him that the overspray would make for slippery floors. I came home from work and wiped out next to the coffee table. It took a few more pledge slips before he remembered to to spray close to the towel and THEN wipe the table. "

&gt;I wonder, why do men do that? Disrespecting another man's sister/mother/wife? Seems like it's one of the worst things you can say to a man

Exactly why they do it. 

The proper response isn't to get mad, but rather to say ""yeah too bad you're ugly and dumb as a rock, she can do better."" Getting mad gives them what they want. Dismissing them and showing them you can laugh off their worst is how you castrate those fuckers. "

667,"It feels like my penis is flexing over and over really fast and really warm honey is being squirted out. 

Right now laying in bed I can flex my penis and it feels good but it's only for a second. When I ejaculate, I don't have to work to flex it, it just happens over and over faster than I could ever do on my own voluntarily and it feels really good. This feels good any where but inside a warm, wet place makes it feel any better because it's like my dick is bouncing off the walls.

The semen coming out feels good. It's warm and it does feel like I'm unloading something (lightening my load like urinating or defecating but much more pleasurable). It comes out the same place as urine but my penis feels very different when I'm ejaculating rather than urinating. I'm erect and flexing like I described.

I think the best part about cumming though isn't down there at all. It's up in my head it just feels super good. Someone else can explain I'm sure. Is it a surge of endorphins or something? Is that the same when women orgasm?

Hope that answers your question. I've never described it in such detail. It was an interesting exercise."

They have a relationship that from Levitt's perspective seems amazing, but it's later revealed from Deschanel's perspective that she was never that into it. Basically, it's a movie about how mismatched relationship goals can really make for a horrible experience for everyone, and people who don't get what ""I don't want a serious relationship"" means can make the situation awkward when they keep trying to force a serious, long-term, romantic relationship."

688,"I was staying overnight at a hotel which was part of pub in a small country town. I checked in reasonably early so thought I'd go into the pub and have a few drinks before dinner. The girl serving was friendly and the pub was quiet so we ended up chatting for a couple of hours.

I got a little tipsy, and we were talking about what I do for a living which is normal enough. At some point she asked,

""Do you want a job?""

In my current state I laughed and said I was quite happy doing what I'm doing, she looked a little confused and we continued chatting, only for her to ask again maybe 2 or 3 times. Befuddled as I was I kept laughing if it off thinking how strange it was that she'd ask me to work at this shitty pub in the middle of nowhere. 

I could see she was getting more frustrated and eventually she says ""Look do you want your dick sucked or not? I know which room you're in I can meet you there in 5 minutes.""

So the penny drops, and feeling a bit embarrassed I politely decline (this girl was 19 and me in my mid 30's). After I say this she gets really angry and refuses to serve me any more drinks, saying how that I was too drunk to be served and how I was hassling her. It got so awkward I asked her to put the drinks on the room bill and slinked out to the only other pub in town across the street."
