"Every time someone says they will never shop here again, I want to get them to put it in writing!

These dummies always come back!"
She's still bitter over some Kansas farm girl dropping a house on her sister...
"Lady, a lack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on ours."
Super hairy dumpster fresh orange chicken..
"Earlier this week someone filled up a 32oz cup with the cheese we use for nachos, then got irate that out manager told them is would be $8. Turns out they thought the $0.25 charge for extra cheese was a flat rate, when in actuality it's $0.25 per ounce. Normally we only ever charge people once anyways because who cares if someone got an extra ounce of cheese, but yeah that was a tad ridiculous."
"Sit down and tell her to go ahead. ""That's my fetish"". Bet most people won't do it afterwards."
"I donâ€™t wanna be THAT gal but thereâ€™s a chance he might have a disability that canâ€™t be seen in pictures i.e. PTSD or depression.

It sure as hell doesnâ€™t excuse his actions in any way but that might be one thing he didnâ€™t lie about."
Why did you describe the president 
Slow news day in town?
This took place in Florida if that clears up anything.
"So touching when little kids show compassion like this, even when it is an inanimate object  :')"
"Unfortunately, people (and I use the term VERY loosely) more often than not leave their manners outside of the store "

Iâ€™m guessing your panic button is like a robbery alarm? Where do you live that it took that long for cops to show up?
Right? Do these people not feel an ounce of shame for being nasty to employees for no reason then coming back as if nothing happened?
"This reminds me of a time when a customer walked by the cash and told the cashier that she was gonna be 30 cents short and if that was okay. How do some people come to these conclusions. Concepts like ""money"" and ""buying things"" have been the same for a long time. They haven't JUST changed for your convenience right now."
Someone once grabbed the tag of a new pair of jeans and used it to return a 5 year old pair of jeans. We tried to find where they were supposed to be for like a week before I asked our manager and she yelled at us.
Funny part is; i checked the buns after this entire ordeal. He was right. They weren't as crunchy as usual.
People that are clearly in the wrong and refuse to admit it frustrate me so much.  He could have at least thanked you.
"We were in a very populated area. They said it was busy and everybody was on calls. Usually they came very quickly, but we always assumed that was because of the donut place in the strip mall."
"""Sewing machine repairer steals seniors machine, replaces it with more expensive model"""
"Working retail really has made me question people's intelligence more than ever before.

Although it has nice experiences aswell."
"This doesnâ€™t make it okay, but Iâ€™m thinking dementia. The customer is probably remembering a machine she had years ago. Thatâ€™s sad, but frustrating. "
"Drugs, dementia, delusions, or a nice mix of all 3?"
"&gt;and told him that he hoped the rest of his day was as pleasant as he was.

Nice. Good comeback. :)"
"I had a customer toss their credit card at me after I told them the total. I picked their card up off the counter, handed the card back, and told them the total again. They got the hint and handed me the card. Wtf is wrong with people? 
Are manners just a figment of my imagination?"
Id like to think your dog sent this one to cheer you up
I don't get why some women are extremely attached to a particular shoe size and become adamant that they are only size X and size Y is an insult to estrogen. Wear the fucking size 8 and be comfortable instead of potentially causing permanent damage forcing your foot into the 7's. No one knows what shoe size your wearing anyway unless you tell them.
"A while ago, I read a post where the employees were allowed to cancel memberships if the customer said that.

Customer: Iâ€™m never shopping here again.

Employee: *cancels expensive membership plan* ok have a nice day

2 days later

Customer returns

Customer: why is my membership canceled?

Employee: you said that you werenâ€™t coming back"
"Ya know, she did look a little witchy now that I think about it ðŸ¤”"
Sounds like y'all called her bluff and she knew she was so busted.
Maybe he's a doctor especially for swollen earlobes... or just some perv.
"&gt; I SPECIFICALLY told you to hold it for me!

Yeah and I specifically told you itâ€™d be put back after 48 hours, next!

(Kudos to the manager for not giving in!)"
"I had a customer who i knew came in daily for a drink and snacks, one day he came in and didnt have enough money to cover the whole thing, he could afford one but not both. I guess he figured because he comes in all the time that i would just let it go, but failed to realize that if my drawer is short I get in trouble for it. Its a business, i cant just let you slide on paying."
"Repair shop hanging by a thread, customer needled over alleged seeing machine snafu, reddit in stitches about it."
"Tag switching is the worst. We have people that do that too, but they just try to put low tags on high priced items and check out like that. "
"I honestly can't understand how people do this. My idea of ""normal"" is apparently most people's idea of ""well spoken with good manners"". I can't understand how people get by being rude all the time."
