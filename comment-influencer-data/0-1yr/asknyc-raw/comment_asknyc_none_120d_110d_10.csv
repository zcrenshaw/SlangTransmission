0,I sit all day at work
1,I take off my pants before getting on the train. That way they stay clean and pressed.
2,"To be blunt, your life is going to suck compared to what you probably have now."
3,"Colson Whitehead in his book ""Colossus of New York"" speaks much about what it means to be a New Yorker.

&gt;You are a New Yorker when what was there before is more real and solid than what is here now.


&gt;You swallow hard when you discover that the old coffee shop is now a chain pharmacy, that the place where you first kissed so-and-so is now a discount electronics retailer, that where you bought this very jacket is now rubble behind a blue plywood fence and a future office building. Damage has been done to your city. You say, ''It happened overnight.'' But of course it didn't. Your pizza parlor, his shoeshine stand, her hat store: when they were here, we neglected them. For all you know, the place closed down moments after the last time you walked out the door. (Ten months ago? Six years? Fifteen? You can't remember, can you?) And there have been five stores in that spot before the travel agency. Five different neighborhoods coming and going between then and now, other people's other cities. Or 15, 25, 100 neighborhoods. Thousands of people pass that storefront every day, each one haunting the streets of his or her own New York, not one of them seeing the same thing.


&gt;Maybe we become New Yorkers the day we realize that New York will go on without us."
4,"There are a lot less needles and human feces

you should spend the next 2 months eating burritos though, because while good Mexican/tex-mex/cali-mex food definitely exists here, it is hard to find."
5,No. The thought had never even occurred to me prior to reading this post.
6,The Kmart that connects to Penn Station has an outdoor furniture section in the basement.  There is never ever anyone looking at outdoor furniture there.  I‚Äôve taken many a nap in a lounge chair down there and have never been bothered.  My gift to you.
7,File a police report...
8,"Plenty of reasons. Sometimes you've been sitting at work for hours. Maybe you're getting off at the next stop. As a lady, sometimes I feel safer not sitting (can get out of creepy situations easier).

That said, if I'm ever standing I'm not blocking the door."
9,"You are not living alone. You are not keeping the car. You are not going to be able to afford a lot and you‚Äôre going to need a very strict budget. 

It‚Äôs not impossible, but it‚Äôs not gonna be fun. If you aren‚Äôt getting raises or promotions after this, or if you‚Äôre done living off ramen, I wouldn‚Äôt."
10,I do avoid sitting on my bed with pants I‚Äôve worn on the train.
11,Streets are way flatter.
12,Whoa. We all in 2019 and this dude living in 3047. Hope I don‚Äôt get there and there‚Äôs a whole reddit meet and sleep going on üòÇ
13,"1. Getting off in 2 stops  
2. Don't want to rearrange multiple bags slung around my body    
3. Have been / will be sitting all day"
14,"&gt;The guy says the movers claimed something completely false (and defamatory really) as the reason why they're cancelling

Oh come on, don't leave us hanging"
15,"You‚Äôre a New Yorker when you don‚Äôt blink twice for Showtime. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the only criteria."
16,You‚Äôre a New Yorker when you know to get the HELL OUT OF MY WAY
17,"I can get you relaxed insane people, or stressed-out sane people. I'll check the back but I'm pretty sure we're sold out of relaxed sane people."
18,Baltimore. It's a long commute but you get so much space!
19,"living alone. no. Living with roommates in the far outerboroughs, yeah, but you'll be struggling. You won't be able to experience the stereotypical young adult life, going out a couple times a week and all that jazz. If you're really good at budgeting, you may be able to treat yourself occasionally, but it will be a struggle. As a Philly native myself, I woudl not advise leaving Philly for a $36,000 salary in NYC"
20,If you love New York so much why don‚Äôt you just marry it?
21,"Sometimes I've been sitting all day, sometimes I'm only going a few stops, sometimes there are plenty of empty seats but they're all directly next to other people and I don't feel like squeezing."
22,Avoid any empty subway cars.
23,Because fuck you
24,"I've been  a subway commuter for 23 years. Never has this thought entered my mind.  I may wash my hands when I get to work if I think of it, or at home, but that's it."
25,Astoria Applebee's
26,"No, I do not change because the subway has tainted my clothing with its imaginary dirt. I wash my hands before I eat with them if I'm right off the train, but I guess now I will add to my post-subway routine ""give thanks that I'm a native New Yorker who never learned to see public transit as disgusting or contaminated and for the fact that I will survive our coming antibiotic-resistant superbug invasion marginally longer than the people who caused it by deciding the whole world was dirty."""
27,Sucking is an understatement... he‚Äôll live with 5 roommates and work. No money to go out for food or drinks or entertainment.
28,"I'm not a tax expert by any means, but you can expect a 30-40% tax rate.

You can qualify for up to $2750 apartment, which is good enough for a decent 1BR in some areas under 96th Street, and a studio in others.

Can you live a good life in NYC on 110k? Absolutely. You won't be living it up or anything, but you can definitely find a good apartment in a nice neighborhood and can afford to go out often. If the lifestyle in NYC appeals to you, if I were you, I'd go for it."
29,Im fucking poor i guess
30,"Learn to walk fast. It's crowded. People are willing to help you if you are lost, just ask."
31,really really tight. you're not gonna be able to find a nice living situation in a nice neighborhood on that kind of pay. you'll have very little discretionary money available for leisure.
32,Where are people finding all these 1 bed room apartments while making 30-50k ?
33,"OP is going to be more than fine. I made $30k/year back in the day, and I lived with roommates who also weren't long on cash, and we had big fun. NYC is a great place to slum it as a young person.

OP's gotta learn where the cheap drinks are, the cheap/free food is, and keep his/her ear to the ground for free shows. There's free stuff going on every day here."
34,"I can‚Äôt imagine something more disturbing than lying in your bed after you‚Äôve been on the subway    

Wow"
35,"This is utterly bizarre. Literally ANY surface you touch anywhere in life will have been touched by other people.

Wash your hands post-subway and pretty sure you're good."
36,Where the hell have you been meeting people?
37,"If you‚Äôre single and can‚Äôt live it up on a six figure salary, you‚Äôre awful with money."
38,"$3.00 on a roll, $3.50 on a bagel."
39,"$31/mo is not too much to pay for a quality publication.

NY Post is not a quality publication."
40,So when you make your first rent payment
41,Lmao when I read ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be living it up or anything‚Äù I laughed. I guess I‚Äôm below the poverty line too
42,"The homeless people are older, cleaner and nicer."
43,Damn recently paid about $7 for this in UES. Feels like I got ripped off and need to find cheaper places.
44,A little trick the maestro taught me.
45,"There is almost always someone who needs the seat more than I do. I have a relatively short commute (30 minutes) and it does me well to be on my feet more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if its a completely empty train and its at the end of a long day... I'll take a seat. There is kind of a sliding scale of crowdedness that influences my decision to sit."
46,That's exactly what someone with a severed head in their freezer would say.
47,"You won't live alone on $36K. Sell the car, it will hold you down and you won't use it.

That said, it's very possible with the right effort and budgeting. You should understand what you're willing to compromise and what you aren't. If you are willing to have roommates (plural), live in an outer borough in a non-trendy neighborhood (look for the signs of a neighborhood to be called 'up and coming' in several years) and have a clear expectation of how much you can/can't go out or eat out, it's doable."
48,"You‚Äôre a little late, Mother‚Äôs Day was last Sunday!"
49,"I've never had allergies in my life, but my eyes have been super weird to the point where it's making me blink a lot the past week or so. I don't know if it's allergies for sure but I don't know what else it could be either."
50,"To me, you‚Äôre not a New Yorker until this city kicks your ass and totally screws you over"
51,You can look up their cargo insurance carrier on the SAFER website for the FMCSA and file a claim directly with their company.
52,"In the herald square station on the nqr platform, there are these green boxes suspended along the track that play a sound when you pass your hand past the sensors."
53,I get lower back pain sometimes if I sit at work too long. Standing can be a relief.
54,"For a seat going into Brooklyn, especially during rush hours."
55,This doesn't really seem like a question that is particularly unique to NYC... You basically were robbed and have a breach of contract.
56,"Bodega: $3.50-$4.00  
Bagel or sandwich/salad spot: $7"
57,And if you're going to stop - get out of the way.
58,We you have enough saved up to be unemployed for 6 months just in case. It not normally how people go about it but it's the smart thing to do in NYC.
59,"The first two reasons are very valid, but the last is also true and very over-looked.

This morning there was a man who looked really run-down standing right over me drinking (what I assume was) an alcoholic beverage. The train car was a reasonable temperature but this dude was sweating bullets to the point it was dripping off of his face. All I could think about was, ""If this guy pukes on me, I won't be able to go on with my life."" Really wished I was in a position to simply move out of his way."
60,"Moved to NYC with a significant other so didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to move into my own place until we broke up, but: 28 years old, $75k salary, $1800 for 1BR on the UES."
61,Tree fidy
62,"I stepped in an everything bagel with cream cheese a few weeks back, so that‚Äôs my new metric for New Yorkerhood."
63,I'm not sure kayaking through an active shipping channel is a smart move for a beginner.
64,"Forreal. First time I visited New York after growing up around SF, I was shocked how many blocks I could walk. So walkable"
65,"I wanna know too! In fact, I‚Äôm looking to meet some more ‚Äúdisturbingly sexual‚Äù people myself, would be curious where you encountered them."
66,"Since you didn't give a budget, here's what I'd do:    

BEC with the green chili hot sauce from the breakfast cart on the southwest corner of 39th St and 8th ave. Bacon crispy.     

Slice of pizza from joe's on Carmine and then dumplings from Fried Dumpling on Mosco St.     

Dinner at Keen's, crab cocktail and thick cut bacon as an appetizer, king's cut prime rib as an entree, followed by a nice scotch.    

Dessert at Spot (preferably with no line). Don't remember what it is called but the lava cake with matcha tea ice cream."
67,I‚Äôve never had my allergies bother me so much in the city before
