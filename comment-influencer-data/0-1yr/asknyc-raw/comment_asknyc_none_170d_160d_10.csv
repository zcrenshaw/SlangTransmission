0,"Materially? I can't fit any more shit in my apartment. 


But there are a ton of experiences and restaurants and other things I want to be able to spend money on."
1,"lol

WHAT HAS 

HAPPENED TO

YOUR

FITNESS

?????"
2,"When I first moved to NYC, back in 2000, I was walking near Union Square. As I stood at the crosswalk waiting for the light to change, an old guy using a cane stumped over and said, ""Go ahead an cross, they gotta stahp for yah!"" as he just straight up walked out into traffic.

And that's how I learned to jaywalk like a real New Yorker."
3,New York attracts lots of high income successful people. Those people tend to spend more on health and fitness and be leaner. So you’re kind of with a self selecting group of people if you’re a finance/tech/whatever professional. Plus New York is an extremely walkable city which also tends to “thin the herd” (bad pun intended). 
4,"Uh, yes? Pretty common and recommended in nyc! "
5,"Here's mine. I have others of course, but the Where Can You Slip a $20 question made me think of this. 

My very cute, very petite, very small town 18 year old cousin with adorable freckles, milky pale skin, and flowing strawberry blonde hair was visiting. I'm perfectly fine, but paparazzi don't notice me. They were noticing her.  (I also look *nothing* like my cousin, including being older and a different race.) She was getting her picture taken coming out of shops on Bowery. Free donuts at Donut Plant, free Jamba Juice, free Rice to Riches. She thought NYers were the sweetest, most generous people in the world. 

I realized I had the golden ticket. She looked like Lindsay Lohan's imaginary sister. Lindsay Lohan had gotten sober, just moved to NY, and was trying to become a thing again. I think people thought my cousin was somehow related and if they treated her well, she'd tell Lindsay. 

I took her to a *packed* restaurant on a Friday night on the Lower East Side to test my theory. I'd probably never get a table there, and if I did, it'd easily be a 2 hour wait quoted to me. Then I'd be sat by the restrooms. I seen people check with the host and get turned away. Then I sent my cousin up. 

They brought a table and chairs from the office/kitchen/secret room, moved people around to squeeze us in, and sat us right up front for everyone to see. 

Tl:dr: My cousin looked like Lindsay Lohan and it got me stuff. "
6,"Quite the opposite. I've found myself parting with books, CDs, etc. that take up space. My life is more experience driven and less possession driven than before. "
7,"When I was younger, I met Mitch Modell (the dude who owns the sporting good store) at the parade when the '94 Rangers won the Stanley cup. I was just a kid, so I told him I wanted to be a goalie when I grew up - so he told my mom to call his office the following week. He wound up buying me a whole set of goalie gear, which I used to play street hockey for a while.

I also remember when the Rangers used to have open practices, and one time Mike Richter was showering, and kinda forgot that it was an open practice - he walked out butt naked into a room full of adoring fans.. I was young, but it was still hilarious. That, plus meeting a bunch of players, plus being on the garden ice made me a Ranger fan for life."
8,"That everyone here is an asshole.

New Yorkers are the most 'willing to help' group of people I have ever met. Every time I've ever slipped and fell everyone within earshot stops for a sec, turns around and has made sure I'm at the very least still alive. We love helping tourists with directions as long as you don't do it in the middle of the sidewalk. I have had stuff fall out of a pocket more than once and had someone rush to make sure I got it back. 

We just value our time more than most of the country does. I'll take our brand of hurried kindness over small town facades of hospitality any day of the week. "
9,You can slip the showtime people a $20 so they are less likely to hit your husband when they jump over him in Central Park
10,"I was walking my dog around central park and heard an exchange between one of those i-banker types and a homeless woman. 

He offered her money for sex. He literally said, ""I want to fuck you for money."" 

She said no, then he handed her cash, said something cheesy like ""There's more where that came from."" She flipped through it, thought about it for a bit and ended up in his car. 

I think about her every time I see a homeless woman in the city."
11,"I'm 36, and have three roommates, aged 35, 30, and 27.

I can't afford my own place. I doubt I ever will in this city."
12,Nope. Apartment is too small. I will say that I have started buying higher quality items instead of cheap shit and backups. 
13,Highbridge Park up in Washington Heights is really cool. One of the oldest pedestrian bridges in the city and you can see all the way downtown.  I went for the first time this Saturday and it was delightfully empty. 
14,"I commuted to Stamford and then White Plains for a few years. At the time I was living fairly close to Harlem-125th so from that perspective it wasn't too bad. But in pretty much every other way, it sucked.

First thing you should consider is the cost of a monthly ticket.

A quick look on the MTA website shows a ticket price from GCT/125th to Stamford at $338/mo in 2016. That seems consistent with what I paid the last time I commuted to White Plains at the end of 2014, but I think the fares are going up this month (April 2019). But let's just say $350/mo after tax.

Your employer may have some kind of commuter benefit program that offsets this, or at least lets you purchase the ticket tax-free. Still, it's a lot of money on top of your normal MetroCard costs. Tack on even more if your employer is not walking distance from the train station and does not provide a shuttle.

Second thing is time. While the train is only ~40 minutes, delays are becoming more frequent. When I was commuting, I ended up taking an earlier train than I strictly needed to, just in case it was delayed. This brings up something else: time.

Sure, it's only 1.5 hrs a day, not including the time you spend getting to/from the train station on either end. But I promise you, it's actually much more than that. When you commute by train, you live and die by the train schedule. Unlike subways that come every 5-10 minutes or more during rush hour, if you miss a Metro-North train by even a second, you are immediately now at least 30 minutes late. I hated feeling so helpless on the platform as my train pulled away.

If you are a social person or work late, you will have to schedule EVERYTHING around the train schedule. Meetings, happy hours, everything. I know, I know, #firstworldproblems but my point is that commuting will take up a lot more time than just the time you spend on the train itself.

Honestly, I hated it. I almost moved to Stamford before finding a better-paying gig in my industry here in NYC. I suggest you do one of those two things, if you can.

Just my $0.02."
15,Sounds like something an NPC would say in a body dysmorphia simulator
16,15 years ago I had a guy jump out of his wheelchair and chase me out of a train at jay street.
17,"Trashbag people trying to start shit happens. Most people on the subway just want to get where they’re going without fighting with anyone. I ride the subway at least 14 hours a week, and 99% of the time without any issues. "
18,"Yeah, I think it’s very much a rat race thing. Some people strive for this traditional “successful” thing which generally comes down to money and looking good. I work downtown and see a lot of these folks. 

There are however also plenty of weirdoes, misfits, artists, musicians, other people, etc. who may make good money and may enjoy fitness but are perfectly happy to not chase the finance bro/chick lifestyle. 

Live for you. Do what makes you happy. Life is too short to chase someone else’s goals. "
19,"Yep, they’re worth a try at least once. The lines aren’t too bad during the week. Chocolate chip is classic."
20,"I know millionaires in their 30s that have roommates.  Its NYC, do what makes you happy."
21,"I'm 31 and can afford my own place (I lived in my 2br alone for a few months when my last roommate moved in with his girlfriend) but was introduced to someone I like, so I have a roommate again. Living alone is nice but cutting your bills in half and having someone to low-key hang out with when you get home with is nice too."
22,My fat ass is doing just fine. 
23,Combo units aren’t good in my experience.
24,"I was walking to work this past summer and the crosswalk sign just came on. A maroon minivan ran the light and almost hit a guy on the other side of the crosswalk from me. 

Without missing a beat, my fellow pedestrian spit one of the fattest loogies I’ve ever seen into the minivans open window. I was 1% disgusted and 99% amazed at his reaction time.

Loogie guy, wherever you are... I love you."
25,But how tall are you now?
26,Tell them to go fuck themselves and do what you want. 
27,so miracles do happen in NYC
28,"Another great article generally on the topic.

29,"I've tried a handful of steakhouses in Manhattan. Here are my top 3:

1. Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse: Wagyu Ribeye (can feed two people) 
2. Quality Meats: Ribeye and Filet is great, they also have a nice lobster tail combo
3. Boucherie West Village: Cote de Beouf, absolute unit of a bone-in ribeye with bone marrow. Will easily feed 2, maybe 3 people. 

Runner-up:
Ikinari was mentioned earlier. Probably one of my favorites for budget steak. You can probably get away with like $50 pp and there's no tip! It's a standing restaurant though, but they might've added chairs due to popular demand. "
30,or you gotta slip the host a $20
31,"Go  to the Union Halls.  Electricians, Plumbers, Stage Hands, and trade you can find.  Ask them how to  get into their apprenticeship programs.  And while you are waiting to get into an apprenticeship program,  try to get work with  the union.

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend an apprenticeship program over a trade school.  And most Apprenticeship programs will pay to  train you.  For example, if the union has welders, they will train you to weld.  If the union drives trucks, they will send you to get your CDL."
32,"1. West 90th is very much not Hells Kitchen and I would be concerned about what else is a lie in your listing. 
2. Yellow cab. The drivers aren’t any worse than Uber and they have a flat rate. "
33,"You can report it to 311 and through the app (where you should be able to upload a photo). Police handle it.

I do this all the time with cars parked in bike lanes but it takes them hours to come.

Report it every time. 

Go to your local community board meeting or contact your representative to see how they can help.

&amp;#x200B;"
34,"I'm not in my 30s, but one of my roommates is 37. not weird at all! everyone's life and budget and priorities are different, and there's no shame in that."
35,"Lmao I felt the opposite! The city made me much more comfortable in my own skin when I saw how diverse bodies are. 

I’m English though and usually see bigger people in oversized clothing or hoodies but in NYC most people seemed comfortable with themselves. Could be just my own perception 🤔 "
36,"&gt; My very cute, very petite, very small town 18 year old cousin with adorable freckles, milky pale skin, and flowing strawberry blonde hair was visiting.

You sound REALLY into your cousin... Wouldn't happen to be a Lannister now would you?
"
37,"Back in the early 90’s I had some fantastic school field trips. In fact my 1st grade that’s all we did. We went to see the Ringling Bros Barnum &amp; Bailey circus. We went to the zoo, went to several museums. I remember asking my mom as we got older why my younger sibling didn’t go on as many trips and my mom said “Because your mayor was mayor Dinkins and he was a good man that funded schools very well.”"
38,"This is how I feel.  I place very little less value on material things and immense value on experiences.    
"
39,In-unit laundry is absolutely all it's cracked up to be.
40,"In Brooklyn, walk along the belt parkway along the water. Fantastic view of the Verrazano bridge and the Manhattan skyline. I would enter from 92nd &amp; Shore Rd and go down the steps into the promenade then cross the belt parkway and head towards the skyline. Ends at the ferry that takes you to Manhattan. 

Usually empty and you get a delightful breeze in the warmer months. "
41,"I don't know.  I frequently pretend Staten Island doesn't exist, and I've lived her for 25 years."
42,"When I was a kid, must have been under 10 years old, we were playing in a pump on a one-way street in the Bronx.  A kid lifted the water with his hands and it added some pressure to the water. A car walked by and the water was so tough that it cracked his windshield. He parked his car and walked out towards us with a hammer and we ran for our lives. "
43,"Not an unknown secret or anything, but it was cool visiting Roosevelt Island from Manhattan and walking through the neighborhood. You ride the sky tram over, and you can see the UES across the east river, but the noise is almost totally gone. Manhattan is a sort of low roar far away, but everything around you is quiet. "
44,"I wonder how applicable this is today, 19 years later. "
45,"Material goods, no, but when I see people living in big apartments compared to my little box, I definitely feel sick with jealousy. "
46,"7-11 pm I typically go to Whole Foods to get work done. They're ll over, so depending on the neighborhood you're in, you can go to a different one. My favorites are Tribeca (huge dining area, almost always tables and outlets available), Bowery (decent sized dining area, tables available except in peak lunch/dinner rush), Union Square is good in the early morning or late night but gets crowded during the day. Chelsea doesn't have a dining area, and the ones at Columbus Circle and Bryant Park are pretty small and typically crowded. Not sure about the other locations.

And if you're ever in Brooklyn, the Gowanus Whole Foods is pretty sweet and has an outdoor rooftop dining area :)"
47,"I’ve been doing this daily for about a year now.  Highly recommend living close to either GCT or Harlem 125th.  Harlem to Stamford via express train is usually around 40-45 minutes.

Unfortunately now I have to commute to Wilton, CT which means I’m just going to cave in and move to Stamford, lol."
48,Could you also slip the showtime people $20 so they are more likely to hit your husband when they jump over him in Central Park?
49,I’m 2019 this reads to me as “How To Blow 2 Grand When You Don’t Want To Use OpenTable”
50,"In tandem with how tons of people there always tend to suggest some milquetoast, paint by numbers, Midwestern/Southern suburban hell complete with stucco McMansions on the subject of some end game housing goal, plenty of people  erroneously in /personalfinance act like you need to be making $250k bare minimum to even survive in NYC.

 I remember catching some comment thread where a guy(who got plenty of attention and upvotes) was scoffing and saying $4500/month for a closet sized 1BR is the bottom line norm for people here. Then when questioned, all the shit he posted as ""proof"" were some obviously expensive luxury housing units and other similarly price properties.  Slapfight continued and then  the guy said how pretty much everyone making below 100k is probably living in inhabitable squalor, eating beans/rice and living in the far ends of Queens. 

Yeah no shit NYC in general is an expensive place to live but there's a lot of clueless people who think it's on some hyper obscene levels with no other options other than textbook expensive properties in Manhattan. 



"
51,"I am a 23 year old female who lived in Manhattan for four years and felt very tired of all the busyness of it. Moved out to Park Slope (Baltic between 4th and 5th) and loved being just far enough from the city. Park Slope has a ton of personality and still has a good amount of amenities (where we were was very close to Atlantic Terminal). It’s definitely more quiet than a lot of Manhattan, but it’s not exactly Bay Ridge either. There lots of nice bars and restaurants and it’s very easy to get any number of trains at Atlantic Terminal. So if you like the idea of being just a bit removed from the city, Park Slope might be nice. But if you like being in the middle of things stay in Manhattan. To speak to my own experience: I moved back to Manhattan after a year in PS for various reasons and now am doing what I can to get back there lol. "
52,"The first time I got the Super Heebster it was so good. I like to just get the components, then make it at home. I assemble weird though, toasted bagel and prepare it open-faced. I like the balance of stuff to bagel and it lasts a little longer. Otherwise it's kinda a behemoth."
53,That only Manhattan is New York City
54,miracle on jay street
55,Can’t emphasize this enough. Nobody cares. Do you
56,"I think it was the end of Star Wars IX, when they finally make it back to Earth. "
57,"Look along the River towns. Along the Hudson Line. Tend to be more progressive.

Most places should be fine. Especially if you like sports.

Avoid Harrison, Valhalla, Thornwood,  Hawthorne and Putnam Valley if you can."
58,About 6 months ago I (late 20s F) briefly dated a man twice my age with a lot of money. He regularly slipped cash (I think more like 60$) to get the best seats/treatment when we went out places.
59,"""Hey...buddy for your troubles""

**slides a 20 at 2 bros. **

""So you want a pie then or...?"""
60,"It sounds like you were big on fitness. Did you talk about running/biking/the gym/whatever you did?


Not that they were comparing you to other people or some NYC standard, but to past you. Were they commenting on your weight/look or just on your fitness routine? 


I think being thin is generally seen as ""better"" than being fat in most places, not just NYC. Look at almost any magazine/TV show/movie/etc."
61,"Not sure if joking, but I more meant that I wonder how well this works with younger maitre d's that didn't grow up in the 80s. May be a different culture. "
62,"You’re 25, enjoy yourself and stay in the city.  Increasing you’re commute to 1-2 hours (both ways) each working day isn’t worth it to save ~$400 a month.  

You’ll inevitably take a few extra Ubers home to Park slope also, cutting down that savings."
63,"I stayed in a hostel in Europe once. A preppy guy in designer clothes in there was also from NYC. I asked him what neighborhood and he said ""SoHo"". He asked me and I said ""Astoria"". He said ""oooh, but you're not in the *real* New York like I am"".

I can't tell if he was really unaware or if he was trying to get my goat but it still came off as incredibly douchey."
64,I do a judgement call if they need help. In the subway I always try to keep an eye out for people in need of some help with direction.
