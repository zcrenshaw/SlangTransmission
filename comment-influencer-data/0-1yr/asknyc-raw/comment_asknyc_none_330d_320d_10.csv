0,"Dude, that's what New York is there for.  "
1,"I have nothing useful advice wise, but my godamn jaw dropped reading this. This is so fucking disgusting. "
2,"Homie, just come to my place. For $20, I’ll let you do your thing. I’ll even light some incense for you. "
3,"How fucking hard is it to raise your goddamn umbrella? You'd think people in this fucking town would have some fucking spatial awareness, but no! They're a bunch of troglodyte narcissists. "
4,"With your budget you’re shopping by price, not by location."
5,"Do you have a job lined up in NYC that pays ~$60k or more? If so, absolutely."
6,Di... did a jaw just fall on me?
7,"I ""broke up"" with my best friend because of an argument about this. She was moving across the country and wanted to drag her toddler to the lighting of the tree, so I humored her as it was literally her last day in NY. Despite having one of those baby backpacks, and me telling her that the subway was not baby-friendly, she insisted on taking this huge stroller with all the bells and whistles, and always ended up carrying the kid anyway, so now I was an asshole trying to barrel down a tourist trap with an empty fucking baby cart. Because literally no restaurants would allow her to park her monstrosity at the next table, we ended up having to eat dinner at TGIFriday's in Times Square. We couldn't even get close enough to see the tree lighting, and we just left. She kept saying that everyone else should make accommodations for her because she had a baby. It made me realize what kind of a person she really is. Fuck her. "
8,"How does a rat corpse just fall out of a hole? Did it leap to its death? Was it *pushed* out of a already existing hole by a homicidal rat or extremely strong cockroach? Or was there no hole and then the weight of the corpse caused the ceiling to crumble down along with the body? 

Edit: Seriously though, fixing the hole monthly is not a solution. They must fix the leak that's causing the hole (and god knows what other unseen damp horrors) - this is not a viable situation if they don't. If they refuse to fix the underlying issue, then I suggest [filing a complaint with the DOB through 311](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/renter/file-a-complaint.page), or moving."
9,"The Met is the grande dame.  It's my favorite without hesitation.

The Museum of Natural History I really enjoy but a lot owes to nostalgia.

The Cloisters for being an underappreciated, tranquil treasure that feels like a secret.

The Neue Galerie because I really love art deco and expressionist art.

The Frick is an underappreciated ~~midtown~~  UES museum with iconic architecture.

Cooper Hewitt is a museum of design in the Andrew Carnegie mansion (worth going for that alone).

The Rubin Museum of Art for its tranquility and really informative and well designed exhibits.  I always learn a ton there and leave feeling calmer than when I entered.

The New Museum for interesting contemporary art.

Honorable mentions: The Whitney, the Met Breuer, the Asia Society

Museums I haven't been to but which are supposed to be great: The Tenement Museum, El museo del Barrio"
10,"Double parked cars should be towed upon sight by patrolling NYPD tow trucks. I don't care if you just have to ""run inside for something quick"" (while everyone else has to merge around them or into oncoming traffic)"
11,I hate when you are standing in the subway and it comes to a stop and you make eye contact with people outside the closed doors and they don't move. I am walking into you 100% of the time
12,"I know this makes me sound compassionless, but I can’t fucking stand homeless people on subways. Being trapped in a car with a urine and alcohol soaked homeless person lying down across 4 seats drives me crazy. "
13,get takeout from Chinatown and cry into your noodles
14,Walking down the street while FaceTiming should be a punchable offense. 
15,Driving through the orthodox/hassidic jewish areas is fucking nerve racking. They walk through no walk signs. The women with the strollers doing it make me scared shitless. They look at you and expect you to stop and when you keep going then they move back. We're not talking fast jay walking. We're talking moseying across cross walks when my light is green. And they don't know it because they don't bother to look until a car is close to them.
16,"33F here, and I went through this shit from 23 to 27 hard. Dating in NYC in your 20s is so fun for a couple of years, and then it nosedives. I can preface this by saying I met my husband by going home with the bartender (for some reason, it worked this time), but before that, I had my most luck meeting friends-of-friends. I am a success story after a decade of swings and misses.

Go to every party, every show, every Facebook invite you can. Coworker having a housewarming? You're in. MASH trivia night with your sister's old roommate? Sure, why not. I found this method to be like the ""you may also like..."" of the real world.

One of my BFFs would whine and complain about being single a lot, but she worked 7am to 7pm every day, and then watched Netflix at home until bed. And the weekends were dedicated to brunch with the gals, working out, and more work/relaxation. Unless she thought she'd date the Seamless delivery guy, I don't know where she thought she'd meet anyone working such long hours and not having any fun. She would have never gone home with the cute bartender because she wasn't at the bar. Or that cute painter from the charity event. Or that nice banker from the house party.

I did online dating for 7 years or so, and maaaan, it is not great in this town compared to others. It's NYC: everything is marketed, and anything that seems really great at first probably isn't. I'd give yourself a break from it for a bit, as it can start to really bum you out (and guys can tell)."
17,An edible bagel.
18,Drinking after work with no worry about getting home safe. 
19,I’ll knit you a scarf. Then give it to you when I arrive for vacation next Saturday. 
20,"This really is an untapped market, I used to let a co-worker and her boyfriend use my apt. for ""dates"". "
21,plain. regular is also acceptable.
22,"$75k here means roommates. It also takes about a year here to build a new social network. It won’t be easy. 

That said, now is the time. It will be harder to try later and harder to unwind if you decide it’s not for you. If you really want to try it and roommates and a year of awkward friendship work doesn’t sound awful, start applying and see what you can get and start saving money. It’s expensive to get off the ground here. "
23,"We've discussed this a couple of times.

Now I can personally comment on this too.

I pulled a Hotels Tonight evening last month. Ran me about 125 bucks. There's also the Carlton Arms Hotel which I'm contemplating for next time. "
24,The BLT at The Wayland on Avenue C makes my toes curl just *thinking* about it.
25,"I never leave without taking a ""provisional."" (i.e. a bathroom break.)

I don’t want to get caught on a stopped train when nature calls."
26,"have it stuffed

instagram it

keep it as a pet.

inspiration to open an organic restaurant serving farm fresh rat meat caught that day -- or carrion - using mice and rats from traps 

use it as the ultimate condom/french tickler. whiskers and ribbed for her pleasure

Hang it from the center of the room as a conversation piece and to ward off other rats"
27,"If you’re into Korean fried chicken, Boka on Saint Marks is always a goodie!"
28,They knew 
29,Kids don't belong in a bar and only a selfish man/woman-child who refuses to grow up and make sacrifices for their children would be dumb enough to expose a child to that kind of environment.
30,"My ex and I once walked into one of those sex shops with ""live shows"". We were walking towards the back because I was curious what it looked like. The guy at the counter said that we can't go back there together but that he can let us go to the basement for $20. 


You can probably easily find a sex shop with a basement you can use for pretty cheap. "
31,"If you're making 200k a year, you shouldn't have a rent regulated apartment"
32,"You don't take antibiotics for a cold. It's people like you who are contributing to drug-resistant bugs.

Take Advil Cold &amp; Sinus and deal with it."
33,Count me in then
34,I would consider moving continents and never using a bathroom again. Are there rats in Antarctica?
35,Cumin lamb kebabs in Flushing
36,A dozen donuts from Peter Pan Donuts 
37,A plain slice at joes. Because home only has one flavor.
38,I’m gonna leave this up so you can reap the downvotes you so deserve. 
39,I don't feel bad for non-poor parents with strollers in the city.  You knew what you were getting yourself into by raising a kid here so you'll have to deal with the hassle of it and I'm in no way obligated or care to make it easier for you.  
40,I was in such a hurry that I didn't even realize what it was until later. I thought it was just debris. Thank God I was getting in the shower next anyway. I gag just thinking about the moment now.
41,"Raised in Queens, moved to Cali and lived in the San Franciso Bay Area for 20 years. Dicked around and got a journalism degree, moved backed to Queens immediately after college with no job lined up so I ended up working shitty jobs. Made no money, just enough for potatoes and eggs and I slept on hardwood floor for a good year because I couldn't afford a bed. Went back to school to study tech and I landed an amazing job that pays significantly more than what a journalist's salary would entail. This money finally allowing me to buy furniture. A++ experience, New York can get tough but if you're savvy and persistent you can buy a bed too."
42,Let's do this my man PM me 
43,"This is why god gave you the horn and the ""THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!?"" gesture "
44,"Thank you for making me chuckle, I needed that."
45,The side of #newyorkliving you wont see on Instagram
46,Wow. My best friend's husband is part owner of that place. I can't wait to tell her about this comment! 
47,Lamb Tagine at Cafe Mogador in LES or Williamsburg. 
48,There should be a curfew on motorcycles. If an obscenely loud car drove down the street at 3am they’d get pulled over but it’s somehow ok for vehicles that are also much more dangerous (and often driven in packs by aggressive idiots) to produce an unlimited decibel level. The fuck is that?
49,[Transit Museum](https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/) 
50,"Always wanted to live in NYC.  I had a couple thousand dollars saved, so I bought a plane ticket a month after I graduated and when I landed at JFK I went to craigslist to look for temporary housing.  

Lived with a crazy guy named John Johnson for a few weeks while I applied for jobs.  Didn't really find anything, so I took a temporary job working in a coffee shop that would pay the bills.  Somehow managed to get a lease in a slummy apartment in Brooklyn.  

I worked the coffee shop job for longer than expected, but started doing internships, wrote a novel and a few short stories (wildly unsuccessful).  Eventually quit the coffee shop when I had enough money saved to last a year.  

Just as I was about out of money, I landed an okay office job somewhat related to my degree.  After working there a year, I had enough saved to move to the UES in Manhattan.  

Probably would have been better off in the long run if I had gone to grad school, had a job lined up, or got my feet wet in a different area, but I have no regrets.  It's always been my dream to live here and I'd rather have an exciting life than an easy life. "
51,"Not sure when you’re coming, but the Bryant Park Winter Village is opening soon and they have a great collection of different NYC vendors all in one place - you could definitely find a scarf there! "
52,"I just realized that I've been living here for nearly a decade, and still haven't been to the Met."
53,"How exactly does one wring out cum from a foam mattress?  

Asking for a friend."
54,"Fried Dumpling in Chinatown. I regularly travel about 45 minutes each way to get it, but that's also to buy frozen for cooking at home. "
55,"It's a ""regular slice"" at the majority of the places I go to."
56,"I mean I was just fucking around but now, I’m starting to think I can make some good money doing this. Especially since my roommates aren’t always home. Plus I got a casper mattress so the bed is nice.  "
57,Wonder if there's any cameras in there.
58,Forcing people out of their homes sucks and should be strongly discouraged.
59,"UWS is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in manhattan. You're right on about the northern parts of manhattan. If your work is on the west side, your commute from way uptown wouldn't be too bad. 

I would just head straight to craigslist, and make sure you see the apartments in person and meet the roommates before agreeing to anything. You could also post on /r/NYCapartments (if you haven't already) and keep your eyes peeled there. 

At your budget, you have less of a choice of neighborhoods and their vitality. Once you've lived in NY for a bit you can always reevaluate and move to a neighborhood you are really feeling. "
60,"most people will respond that it’s impossible, but it is possible

had a friend get 1 br in a 3 br in the east village for $1100

had another friend get a 1 br in a 4 br in brooklyn for $800

it’s doable

def will need to be shared 

you just have to look hard"
61,One time I got on the subway and this guy was reading the same book I was reading.  I immediately got off the subway on the off chance that that had any chance of starting a conversation.  
62,"If you're walking up the subway stairs slowly and inconveniencing the people behind you because you lack the common sense, courtesy, and self control to not to be looking at your phone every damn minute of the day...just, screw you. On stairs you go up and down the stairs and that's it."
63,Look at areas along the 7. Its a pretty easy commute to midtown and there are some affordable neighborhoods near the 7 in Queens
