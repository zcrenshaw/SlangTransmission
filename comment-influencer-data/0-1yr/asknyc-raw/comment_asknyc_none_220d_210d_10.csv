0,My boyfriend needed a root canal last year and went to Dr. Lam. It was affordable and he was able to get appts pretty quickly. He‚Äôs been back since for additional dental work. 
1,[Use this to find a MetroCard merchant that accepts payment through phone I guess](http://tripplanner.mta.info/metrocardmerchants/)
2,What do I do if I am not going to be in the country for 5 months? Will my window close? Most of the expenses were incurred in June of 2018 and I won‚Äôt be back in town till July of 2019. 
3,"Oasis is amazing but it's Palestinian, so different from Turkish Doner ...  best thing to get at Oasis is a Falafel sandwich."
4,"I‚Äôm very glad to hear it! We will have to take a look at Queens, I know I‚Äôve seen Astoria pop up a lot. Where did you move from (if you don‚Äôt mind me asking)?"
5,"That‚Äôs some great perspective! We would prefer to stay below 1500-2000 for a studio or 1br. We each make about 25k/yr, but her mom makes much more and has volunteered be a guarantor on a lease."
6,"Yeah I just checked. $140 rt this weekend and the hostel is $35/night. Just don‚Äôt go whenever the school holidays are.

"
7,That sounds awful!  Thanks for sharing your experience 
8,"I‚Äôm a pretty non-threatening looking woman in my late 20s and I had my bag searched at my train in Harlem. They barely glanced in and let me go. I don‚Äôt know if they were searching other bags more thoroughly or what but they were pretty chill with me. I even joked with them and said ‚Äòsure you can search it but the jokes on you, my bag is packed full of shit.‚Äô ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
9,Search this sub for Parka or coat. There have been a dozen threads on it already. 
10,I'm a big fan of things like One Medical and Eden Health.
11,Fotocare has film cameras. Their online list is not accurate so just give them a call. They‚Äôre super nice people!
12,"The creative amoeba-like boundaries realtors make up that can disappear neighborhoods is kind of amusing as well and I imagine there's tons of people out there unfamiliar or not from around here that go about thinking they're in one place when it's really another.

 I spent some time growing up in Maspeth and I've seen tons of real estate people who were going hardcore with calling very distinctive parts of it Sunnyside, Ridgewood and Bushwick.  "
13,"as cliche as it sounds central park is a good place because there are people around but there's also a ton of space too and you can find any amount of foot traffic, so basically you can control the amount of people around you."
14,use hand cream my guy
15,Thanks. Wouldn't that mean the seller and their broker would be way more motivated to sell to someone who doesn't bring an agent? Seems like there's a big disadvantage for any buyer who comes with an agent
16,"I‚Äôve experienced this too. I think it‚Äôs a combination of overworked an in short supply primary care providers and the fact that they probably make more money if they send you to urgent care. My pcp office has an urgent care in it so I feel like it‚Äôs the default for them.

Do you have tele-doc? This is a great feature if your illness is something simple."
17,I've never heard of that. Will look into it!
18,"I asked because if it is you can call DHCR and gain more insight from them what your rights are as a stabilized tenant.

If what the LL is doing is illegal, it can be rectified via DHCR appeals process. Good thing is you don't have to pay a lawyer or go to housing court. Bad thing is it can be a long wait for a decision."
19,Enroll in a pre-natal program at a hospital based outpatient clinic where the hospital has a labor and delivery ward.
20,Check if you have that 'one medical' shit. It is supposed to fix this exact issue. 
21,"20th is pretty extreme but a few days (and a week plus if you wanna pick your time) is pretty normal. 

My City MD copay is fucking $75 and it hurts, but if you gotta go you gotta go. "
22,You know this is about a $1 and 15minute fix right? Whip out YouTube. 
23,Call Planned Parenthood. They did my snip after I had a horrible experience with my PCP's referral.
24,"Congrats! I don't have a specific doctor to recommend. It wouldn't make sense to recommend a doctor in Brooklyn if you're in the Bronx for example. My suggestion would be to figure out what hospital you want to deliver at, and then check out their list of what PCPs and OBs are directly affiliated with that hospital either through the hospital's clinic or a separate practice. You can usually filter by location and what Medicaid plans they accept. I try to keep all my doctors within the same hospital system because it keeps all my health info in one database. My PCP can see the doctor's notes from my last Obgyn visit and my pulmonology test results without me lifting a finger. Another reason to stick with a hospital afiliated practice is that they send those patient surveys and take patient concerns seriously. "
25,Read the sidebar.
26,"here's a list of doctors that have been compiled on /r/childfree:https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/doctors#wiki_new_york

i wish i had a personal story to share but i'm rooting for you from the sidelines!"
27,"Primarily, I hate my job (see my answer to another commenter above).

I‚Äôm in Fort Worth.  I hate the food &amp; that you can‚Äôt really walk anywhere.  And I miss being somewhere truly diverse. "
28,"Thanks! I had not even considered something like this. 

The Apple people told me it was worth repairing given the year. Of course, they simply replace everything. But I assumed it was worth doing for several hundred bucks.

I did not even know about refurbs. I will have to look into that.

Data is already backed up so that is not an issue.

Thanks again. I appreciate it. "
29,it's ok i'm a cop
30,i'ma cop some leopard meat ayy
31,My niece calls that the ‚Äúpipes of panic.‚Äù CLANK CLANK CLAAAANK @ 3am.  I think I read once you can get covers that stop that noise. Too lazy to google it right now.
32,Seaport Buffet on Emmons Ave.

36,"I (27F at the time) moved from California with about a bedroom. I ended up selling most of my furniture (+$200), packing clothes, shoes, toiletries, and a few other necessities into three large suitcases, and flying (-$300 w/ bag fees). I‚Äôve rebuilt a bedroom and enough of a kitchen since then. I also splurged on a new mattress and bed frame (-$1k) because goddammit sleep is important. 

I didn‚Äôt end up spending anything on movers, though I did book an Lyft from airport (-$50 maybe?) and moved in with a guy off Craigslist. I moved almost everything to my apt, a 5 story walk up, by myself (DO NOT RECOMMEND), and then ended up paying a few task rabbits to help haul the bed frame up the stairs only because it required two people (-$80). 

I don‚Äôt know if this helps, since fees can vary depending on how stubborn/lonely you are. But the fastest way for me to do things was pack essentials in those suitcases and IKEA new furniture (-$180, not including bed) once I got here. 

Plane tickets: ~$250
Baggage fees: ~$100
Lyft home: ~$50
Not crying in a stairwell because you dropped a bed on your foot: priceless

Good luck!"
37,Yea my friend spent a night in jail because of turnstile jumping. 
38,Han Dynasty
39,"My old pcp was like this but would also gladly talk on the phone on any day if you have a mildly-urgent question.

My new pcp has walk-hours every afternoon.

40,"You could try Tower Cleaners on East 10th Street and University Place. Whenever he's in, Jay is a really cool guy and definitely knows his stuff. "
41,"Brooklyn would be one of the five largest cities in the US if it weren‚Äôt part of NYC. 

What kind of price point are you looking for when you say affordable? Where in Manhattan will she be spending her time? What kind of income can you guys prove?"
42,"Your claim is for breach of contract. You need a lawyer but the amount is so low that it‚Äôs kinda in that territory where you gotta take them to small claims yourself or just eat it.

It‚Äôs very easy to file a claim in small claims court. I‚Äôd say ask again and if they refuse, file.

This is not legal advice."
43,"I'd be careful with USPS Media Mail. They've lost (my) boxes before. Thankfully, it was books I could re-purchase on Amazon. But if it were important papers/anything of sentimental value...

&amp;#x200B;

... better to pay a few extra bucks."

Thank you and glad I could help. In terms of moving things it doesn't get any simpler."
45,"Why does it have such low ratings then? Also for those who don't know, recently 3 Asian employee's were killed over there."
46,"You have the right to refuse a search, but they won't let you past the turnstiles. You can always just go in a different entrance though. It's security theater."
47,I suffer from dry skin in the winter.  [Use this lotion consistently](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/gold-bond-medicated-eczema-relief-cream/ID=prod6274430-product). 
48,"my dad just became a real estate agent. he's not been doing so great, and i wish he had chosen something more stable. it sucks to see him floundering and throwing money at something that i can't really see him breaking even on. "
49,"&gt; Stop worrying about what areas are hip, and find a neighborhood you like and can afford and just live there

That's not how this works, bruh."
50,Haha. Thanks!!
51,Coconut oil works too! (‚ÄúFree‚Äù if you have some at home already)
52,Yea that sounds right. Just play it cool. 
53,No asking for drugs here bro. 
54,Don‚Äôt use this subreddit to yank WiFi. 
55,Mille Feuille offers macaron classes that are fun - and there‚Äôs usually a groupon option. Milk bar also offers classes.

57,"&gt;I love a good burger with fries

There's a new burger place that just opened on Hudson Street above Canal called [Whitman's.](https://www.whitmansnyc.com/)  Not sure how far from you that is.  I haven't eaten there yet (am an not into burgers or fries), but my neighbor really liked it. So take this advice for what it's worth ‚Ä¶"
58,"No you‚Äôre right , I can see how that seems like you‚Äôre getting ripped off . Then maybe they should have different percentages for time still on the market . Maybe 2-3% first month then increment . But then you have to worry about the broker just fucking off for the first month .  "
59,"I moved all the way from Brooklyn, NY! "
60,"Most firms are members of REBNY which requires a 50/50 split.

  As a buyer's real estate agent, I offer to share my commission with them. 

  There are plenty of firms that offer sub 6% listings. Also if you don't mind some legwork you can pay as little as $500 to get listed on the major real estate listing websites."
61,"Been there once, it was extremely mediocre.  Like, kind of not-good. Felt no need to return. "
62,"My 12 year old son says, ""I can't really give that good of a recommendation, because everything in NYC is awesome."" But he did mention Top of the Rock and One World Observatory as two of his favorites. Also, ""Don't eat at chain restaurants, because there's a ton of not-chains that you can only eat at in NYC and they're amazing."" 

We live in NJ, so we go in fairly frequently. For Broadway, he recommends Lion King."
63,"That‚Äôs what I was mainly wondering. They can search bags but can‚Äôt search you or your pockets. Makes sense. 

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre looking for anything except bombs or weapons. They probably wouldn‚Äôt bother with small amounts of weed or anything. "
