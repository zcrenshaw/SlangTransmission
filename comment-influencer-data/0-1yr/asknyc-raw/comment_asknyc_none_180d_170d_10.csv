0,"If possible go to the venue to get tickets, there will be no fees added besides tax (in my experience) 

Premium seats are usually not available as they get bought up by and sold by the soulless dick tarts at ticketmaster and the like"
1,"Which dorm is it? A/C in June/July is almost a must (unless you have a lot of really good fans). I lived in a dorm without A/C my freshman year there, and while it sometimes sucked during the day, I had three fans going on at all times so it wasn't too bad - however, I moved in late August (so better than June/July), I was on the third floor, had two floor fans and one small desk fan, and avoided being in the room between 11am and 5pm if at all possible."
2,"The Raines Law Room at the William, awesome place!"
3,"For architecture, the Woolworth Building lobby tour or drinks at the Beekman Hotel. 

If you‚Äôre in Chinatown/LES, check out CW Pencil Enterprise. It‚Äôs a cool store that sells a ton of different pencils. "
4,"Huh. So do most parks not allow dogs overall? I guess only the huge ones, or the dog specific parks, let you walk your dog?"
5,That's news to me. Fuck. 
6,"I've been to b and h. Didn't look at laptops, but generally their sales staff is on point and knows their stuff.  (Usually true of microcenter as well)"
7,Accompanied my friend to an emergency eye dr appointment that was tucked away within the Lenscrafters there. The energy was quietly uneasy.
8,"It is terrible, I know. Macy's is my usual too. There always seems to be a lot of riffraff at that mall too. "
9,"If you like dancing, there‚Äôs industrial night downstairs at Pyramid in the east village. 

The local vampire chapter, The Court of Lazarus, is meeting on Sunday night at Madame X. Apart from needing to dress in formal goth and enduring/enjoying some rituals, they play some pretty good goth/industrial music. "
10,"Sweet, thanks for the info! Just looked up Street Sects and they're definitely right up my alley."
11,Miami is a vacuous nightmare . NYC is harder but it will reward you if you can keep up with her .
12,"Ramen Ishida on the LES does a reeeeeally awesome vegetarian bowl, but it's not much of a sit-down spot. Minca is another favorite of mine - a bit more than 20 minutes from 18/6th, but it's closer to the vibe you want I think and it's really solid for vegetarians. Third choice would be Misoya. It's also sit down with alcohol, but the ambience isn't as fun as Minca I think."
13,"You know I'd totally agree, if it wasn't this dark &amp; dank 2 story, somehow, gigantic JCPenney relatively under Macy's."
14,Never noticed the Mall of Manhattan until a couple months ago on the subway. My immediate impression was that it was where Pennywise goes clothes shopping. 
15,"Ramen Hood, Nakamura, Ivan Ramen, Goemon. 

Ramen Hood isn't as good as when it opened in LA for some reason; noodles are overcooked and broth isn't as rich, but it's a nice spot.

Nakamura has a couple of options. Very small so you will have to wait, although I got a table immediately one night last week. Just lucky.

Haven't tried Ivan yet. 

Goemon had a pretty reasonably vegan ramen and the owner seemed to really care about what I thought about it, which was cool."
16,"Pre-tax monthly Metrocard, and about $35-50 of Uber rides (3.5-5 $10 dollar rides).

So $150-175."
17,My dog poops on the sidewalk. I clean it up. Most others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs disgusting. 
18,"Hint: some of their parents are rich.
"
19,"I live in west Chelsea and walk my dog in the  west side park. Dogs are not allowed on the grass. Please don‚Äôt let your dog go on the grass as it kills the grass. The curb really is the best place for your dog to go. It‚Äôs what all dogs do. This city is dirty and already kinda smells, one more dog won‚Äôt change that. "
20,Astor Wines has a decent selection of sake. 
21,Pretty sure all that shit is just made up.
22,https://youtu.be/1HHpUtx-uOQ
23,Can confirm.  Am riffraff. 
24,"I make my own hours and average about five hours of solid, uninterrupted work per day. I do the pomodoro technique: 25 uninterrupted minutes on, 5 off."
25,Probably because you could buy 20 t-shirts for 5 bucks lol
26,"Damn, I thought I heard something about that. Hopefully they finish it up for the spring / summer.   "
27,"Do an art gallery crawl in Chelsea, stopping for wine at any place you like. [crawl](https://www.google.com/amp/s/madhattersnyc.com/2018/01/31/art-gallery-crawl-new-york-city/amp/) then head to the Whitney Museum in meatpacking. "
28,"Tea and Sympathy https://www.teaandsympathy.com/

Real English food and lots of tea!"
29,"The Whitney has the Andy Warhol exhibit right now it was wonderful. Buy student tickets online in advance, they don‚Äôt check "
30,Target has them!
31,What about a pet sitting service so he can stay in his own environment?  
32,"You won't go wrong with the popular museums... MOMA, Metropolitan,  Guggenheim,  Whitney, even American Museum of Natural History "
33,"It does, it's normally packed with a pretty young crowd the later you go. There is bocce ball in the back too. "
34,Hudson River Park
35,"Amazing, thanks!"
36,"If you want a Cinnabon in that general area, there's a Burger King on 6th, next to the Macy's, down some stairs, that's kind of hidden. They have Cinnabon and occasionally I venture down there when a craving hits. It's an odd location, but a delicious 1k calories."
37,"Did I miss something with this bar? I went right when we moved here, live a block away, and never went back."
38,"He or she will learn quickly - I relocated here from a place with green space everywhere and it took my dog a little bit to become comfortable going on the curb. 
Always, always keep multiple dog bags in all jacket pockets/bags. Nothing is worse than realizing you don‚Äôt have any. 
Don‚Äôt want to admit it but I have actually used trash to pick up after her, and I‚Äôve been asked many times by other dog owners in a panic for bags which I‚Äôm always happy to share in those instances."
39,Back when I was commuting from New Jersey I frequently used it as a shortcut between Penn Station and the BDFM. 
40,Yeah! Bourbon chicken!
41,Isn't there a Cinnabon in there? I've never had Cinnabon. Better Call Saul made me want to try it. 
42,Roosevelt Island is totally flat and has a beautiful view. 
43,Came here to say this. Great food and drinks and books! 
44,r/RunNYC
45,it's haunted by the ghost of Gimbel's
46,"It depends on the building as well.  Beyond the free rent, a super will likely have opportunities to do jobs for tenants.  Mine is like a hawk about asking if I need help getting things done.

The tricky thing is knowing what's the building responsibilities, and what's yours at times.  "
47,"I went, ignorant of the horrors, on my second day living in NYC. 

My grandmother passed while I was in the process of moving, so one of the first things I had to do was figure out where to get a dress for the funeral. I got on google maps and was immediately overwhelmed by the options, until finally a familiar name caught my eye: JC Penny. 

I think my exact thoughts, after fighting my way through hoards of tourists, were ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never leaving the house again‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this place??‚Äù "
48,"No Cinnabon, just the Starbucks. üò≠"
49,"I walked by , is it that bad ??"
50,The fountain!!!
51,KB Toys used to be in there...that and the fountain were all I cared about.....the elevators were cool. 34th street all together needs help
52,I have way more fun at the bars across the street
53,"Yeah, bought shoes there last minute so I could look presentable in a meeting 15 years ago. But it‚Äôs not and was never a fancy mall. "
54,No
55,It exists for walking indoors part of the way between Herald Sq and Penn Station when the weather sucks.
56,Definitely Strand.
57,"That specific location closed before the chain went bankrupt. It, along with other stores, apparently closed specifically to make room for the JC Penney according to Wikipedia."
58,"With the exclusive deals they work out with the venues, I wouldn't have been shocked to find out you pay that fee, somehow, even at the venue."
59,"Williams Sonoma, if you want kitchenware. When I went to school in the area I spent many a lunch break wandering the Columbus Circle location, stocking my dream kitchen."
60,Hide it when you‚Äôre not in the room 
61,Yeah.  It is beyond rude.  We think it is rude when you want to change lanes and the rear car doesn‚Äôt slow down a little and wave you in.  This gesture must always be followed by the thank you wave from the merging driver.  What you describe is what some would call harassment.  
62,"Another metal bar that I liked to frequent when I moved here is Lucky 13 Saloon. Good music and shows. Cheap drinks, bar top dancers, and horror movies on the TVs. Although it is a bit of a distance from LIC. You may be able to take the G to the N/R to get there."
63,"I was going to suggest Oiji, but the only veg option is a mushroom salad. "
