1,"I told this story on this sub before - I remember one time I was in a taxi, and the cab driver was telling me he was writing a book of his 'cab stories'. He told me he always wanted be driven by one of his passengers, so he can put it in his book. So right on 5th ave and 23rd, I said ""OK - let's do it!"" - so we both got out, he hopped in the back, and I jumped in the front and drove the rest of the way there.

I also remember getting my hair cut at FAO Schwarz when I was really young. You could sit in a rocket ship, or on a horse.. really clever for kids like me who were scared of the barber."

10,"For some reason, none of my coworkers know what Citymapper is and they are always late. If you take the Subway, do yourself a favor and download the Citymapper app. It's saved my ass so many times.

I download it for anyone visiting me from out of town, and everyone ends up loving it. It's way more functional than google maps. "

(They seem like they're just about meditation, but the leader has bizarre ideas and a history of dehumanizing teachings about e.g. LGBTQ people.) Part of the show is a scene where the Chinese government traumatically kicks them out. Apparently, the show is not very impressive, and many of the testimonials from celebrities are out of context.

39,"Knowing where to stand on the platform for your commute could save you several hours each year.   This is something CityMapper and Exit Strategy (*Only iOS is updated with all the stations*) show you on the app.

&amp;#x200B;

The concept explained:

&amp;#x200B;

**Before:**

* You enter station A at your commute at your closest exit and get off at station B, then walk to your exit every work day
   * You currently wait for the train when you enter the platform, get off the train and have to walk down the platform or within the station or on the street (and passing another subway exit)

**After:**

* You enter station A and walk to the point on the train that is closest to your exit at your destination station (station B)
   * Special note: *You walk to this location on your platform while waiting for your train (time you would otherwise waste), if your train arrives you get on as far down as you've walked to your target spot to not miss the train*
* You walk to the closest exit to your work, but this time the walk is much shorter as you've already positioned yourself closest to that exit at the original station

**Other Notes:**

* If you ride other trains and transfer, you'll need to find your optimal point for your transfer
   * Example, you take the L from Bedford Avenue to Union Square and want to transfer to the Q.   You enter enter off Bedford (front of the train) and have to walk to the front/middle to make it in front of the stairs down to the Q.  (You can tweak this method a few times by identifying objects on your platform and eventually getting right in front of the steps, avoiding crowds that form, potentially letting you catch another train)  You then walk to the optimal spot on the Q platform for your final stop exit.
* **Keep in mind what seems like the closest exit may not be the most optimal**, I walk an extra 100 feet to avoid crossing an Avenue (missing the walk signal can easily add 30 seconds to my commute each time)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The proof:

* Let's assume the platform takes 2 minutes to walk from end to end.   Let's assume you need to walk 1 minute from your entrance/exit to the desired spot.
* We'll also assume you work 50 weeks a year, with two weeks for vacation or WFH
* 1 minute saved for finding the optimal location to your exit doubles due to the round trip effect.
   * 2 minutes a day, x5 work days in  a week is 10 minutes a week.
   * 10 minutes a week x 50 work weeks is 500 minutes saved
   * 500 minutes is roughly **8 hours and 15 minutes**
* If you only have to walk a short distance for your optimal location and only save 30 seconds, you'd still save **4 hours a year**
* If you have multiple transfers or have to walk a long distance in your station, you could save 1:30-2 minutes each trip, resulting in larger gains

**TLDR: Figuring the best location to stand on a platform and the exit closest to my destination saved me at least 8 hours this year.**"

42,"As a plumber, I often discuss with coworkers about how much money we could make giving tours of the places we have worked. I've been to the lowest lows and the highest highs. From the bowels of the subway ventilation tunnels to the roof of the trade center. I've worked overnights in Macy's herald square and numerous office buildings . I've renovated parts of empire state building and been in Manhattan's hottest night clubs with all the lights on to make repairs hours before they opened. I was part of a co-gen installation in a building on central park west and would repeatedly see big name celebrities coming down to use the gym next door to the boiler room. One of my most memorable experiences was working in an art gallery, and the curator had a pet raven that was black as night with a ring of white feathers around his neck. "

60,It’s faster to get around Manhattan by bike than it is by car but if you leave before 6:30 there is rarely much traffic 
61,"From all the way back in the 50’s per my aunt:   

“Our section of the Bronx was like so many areas in NYC it was a village existing between Webster and Jerome Ave. running along Gun Hill Rd.  We had our share of  colorful characters: like Jim Harris, who stepped out the door every morning do a skip jump thing and march down the street whistling off to work.  Mr. Braddor, an older man living next door, would sit in his window and when I’d look over there he’d take his false teeth out to show me.  There was the Reed’s that lived up the street, one yr. the Dad dress up as a mosquito, for Halloween, and jumped out in front of cars going down the block-causing a few fender benders.     

But mostly we knew everyone and everyone was in the same economic class.  I wasn’t aware of some people having more than us. Some of the kids had soda, cookies, ice cream etc. at home, we didn’t.  On hot afternoons when the kids went in from playing in the street to get a cold drink my Mom had a beaten up aluminum sauce pan she would run cold water in until it was really cold and let us drink from the pan-it was a real treat.  I don’t know if she didn’t buy soda because she didn’t believe in kids drinking it (which she didn’t) or because we couldn’t afford it.  Probably both.   
    
My brother Brian was born in ’53, Mom would take us walking everyday in Woodlawn Cemetery, where we would feed the ducks and check out the tombstones-then off to The Cookie Jar Bakery on Jerome Ave. for great cookies. 
      
I remember when Mom took me shopping she would get all dressed up in nylons, high heels and a favorite dress, even to the A&amp;P.  The big shopping trips were to Macys and the dreaded Alexander’s bargain basement on Fordam Rd., everything was thrown in
big piles on tables.  It took us hrs. to find anything, that’s how she was able to afford to dress us all for Easter Sunday.
       
I went to, what I called, St. Ann’s of Auschwitz, on Bainbridge Rd. which was 2 or 3 blocks away. Once or twice a yr they would let us have recess-we were all let out into a side yard which was maybe 20 X 30 completely enclosed with a 10’ chain link fence.
The whole school would get out at the same time consequently you couldn’t even more it was so crowded.  Twice a yr we went on field trips, one to the Sisters of Mercy bazaar and again to see Our Lady of Fatima in the Lowes Theater on Jerome Ave.   

We had Johnny and his ice cream truck come through every afternoon, for awhile the Good Humor man drove through but we all threw rocks at his truck.  There was a produce truck came through also, one time we stole a coconut form the back of the truck. The coconut was still in the hull and we went through hell trying to get that thing open, we threw it under cars going down the block and took it up to the roof of a 15 story building and through it off-never got it opened.    
 
I would babysit for some women on the block, I’d take the babies for a walk around the block, in their carriages, for 10 cents.  That money was spent in the kosher deli on dill pickles which they sold out of barrels for 5, 10 or very large 15 cent pickles.  Or Louie’s’ candy store for Joyva halvah.  Louie would always pinch my cheeks until they hurt and tell me what a cute girl I was.  Occasionally I’d swipe and extra halvah as pay back for the cheek bruising.    
 
The music of the time was fabulous, R&amp;B-doo wop and early rock, Frank Lymon, the Del Vikings, Shirells. There was groups of kids standing under street lights on the corners singing to all hours of night, they sounded as good and in some cases better than what Allan Freed was playing on the radio.
     
Occasionally we would go to the Lowe’s theater on Jerome ave. when I was 12 an older woman came on to me in the ladies room.  Then there was Nino, a guy of about 25 who stalked me for along time, he would hide in alleyways to watch me.     

When I was 13 we all decided we were going to be “Earth Angels” from the song title.  So we bought black jeans and got into a tub of hot water to shrink the jeans as tight as possible, I wore the wet jeans all day.  Then we set our hair in bobby pins and put scarves on (hot look of the day) Off we went to Lil Italy to hang w/ the Hell’s Angels, well we couldn’t find anyone who owned up to being a Hell’s Angel so we wound up hanging w/ a gang of younger hell’s angels wanna bees.  That’s when I met my first big crush Marty Pollazotto and my first kiss.   
 
When I was 14 I graduation from St. Ann’s and was intent on going to a public school-they had so much more fun w/ all the field trips they took and all.  I went to Walton HS on Resevior Ave.  It was way different than the cocoon of St. Ann’s, it was an all girl school and some of those mama’s were really tough.  There was a girl in junior class interested in me and she and her friends would try and trap in the bathroom.
    
St. Patrick’s Day was second only to Christmas as a family celebration.  My Dad (as a fireman) marched in the parade as did my brother Bill (w/ Cardinal Hayes  HS) and sister Jean (w/ St. Thomas Aquinas HS)  When the fire dept marched down the street w/ the bagpipes playing my Dad look straight ahead very stern faced, but when he got to my Mom and I he would look over at me and wink.  I thought as a child they held the parade for my Dad, after he marched he would come back and get me on put me on his shoulders to watch the rest of the parade.“"

65,"My 2nd birthday party was at a McDonald's playplace. We ordered a round of chicken nuggets, to get things started. It took 9 1/2 minutes to get them. I was very upset, because it usually only took 2-4 minutes for my chicken nuggets to be served at this location. Unfortunately I had no way to express my displeasure, since I couldn't speak yet, so I just shit myself in protest. I remember it like it was yesterday"
