0,All the lesbians I know go downtown.
1,Trashcans on every corner.
2,Vacancy tax
3,"For this extent of a problem, I'd take all my paid bills &amp; proof of payment (cancelled checks or bank account statements) to the local DEP office. Don't rely on a phone call and vague promise of a ""6 month review process."" Go there with your records and get their immediate attention. There is a DEP office in every borough.

This is  nuts.

Also, make copies of everything, so you can leave a set with them."
4,"I recommend In-patient. I was on two 2mg bars plus 12-16 norcos a day when i could afford my full blown addiction. I quit cold turkey and ended up having psychosis that had me hallucinating and convulsing for a few days in a hotel room. I ended up in the emergency room then in the psych ward for 3 days after that. I ended up getting released to my mother and spent a few months recuperating. She assumed I was still an addict and kicked me out so I lived between my car and occasional overnights at my friend's house. 

It took a few months to get a job and eventually  everything worked out. It took me almost 6 years to pay off the massive loans (6 figures) that I racked up living off loans and credit during this time. I was previously making 6 figures. I had one rebound with alcohol where I would drink until blackout drunk, and this lasted 6 months until i realized i was continuing the pattern of self medication. I haven't used anything in about 5 years now, and have no desire to use. The biggest regret started about 1 year after being sober when i realized that most of my life had been a haze of self medication from one drug to another and that was lost time that I could never get back. Good luck and do whatever is required to give her head time to heal. It is possible and just takes time for the brain to re-wire itself."
5,Yes. Plenty of older people and folks with disabilities order food; they are an important reason delivering to the apartment door is the standard.
6,I feel so lame reading these responses! I meet up with friends maybe twice a month on average? I’m 30. It used to be much more frequent when I was 22 until late twenties.
7,Times Square.
8,"I go down. Not because I don’t think it’s their job to deliver to my door but because it feels shitty to stand there waiting, in my pajamas, doing absolutely nothing, while they haul their way up four flights in a dark unfamiliar hallway while their bike is outside and they’re holding other people’s food too. These workers make hardly any money. It’s a small courtesy to meet them halfway. 

If I had a disability or were sick I’d probably mention that I need delivery to the door when I place the order."
9,"As tourist you'll probably only have 3 places to tip.  Tip when you are at a traditional sit down restaurant with a waiter and table service (15%-20%). Tip your bartender $1/drink. And tip your cab driver, if you take any cabs (but don't tip uber!).

Frankly tipping your bartender is most important because foreigners get drunk and forget.
You shouldn't have any other issues."
10,"I'm not sure of where you should send your daughter, but I wanted to say I'm sorry you're going through this and I'm glad you are willing to help your daughter. 

I work with a lot of kids with addiction issues and it can be a long road. Just be loving and supportive, she might relapse and fuck up, but she can get back on the wagon and keep fighting when she does. 

Talking to a doctor might give you some clarity I the best setting for her. It really depends on her level of addiction and her habits and whatnot.

All the best,

OBN"
11,"Your council man’s, Bob Holden, Facebook page is asking those affected to contact his office. Not sure what assistance is available but worth asking."
12,"I live on the fourth floor of a walk up. 99% of the time they come up. The 1% of the time they call me to come down I do, because I’m assuming they either (1) can’t find parking or (2) don’t have a lock for their bike or don’t feel comfortable locking their bike in front of my building (weed dealers congregate outside my building). So to answer your question, I would say yes it is expected, but be flexible if they call for you to come down."
13,"You should also check out the restaurant temp agencies. It's one shift at a time and you decide if you want to do it or not.

You can just do a shift of washing dishes or line cooking and get paid immediately I think.

Just an option."
14,Exile de Blasio to Massachusetts.
15,"The list of where **NOT** to tip is practically infinite.

It's easier to figure out where to tip.  This is a good guide https://www.immihelp.com/tipping-tips-in-america/"
16,LI north shore beaches are all stony (you can even take a trip to Stony Brook!)
17,Hi! Go to the American Academy of Dermatology website and research their free cancer screenings. Their volunteer doctors give them throughout the year.
18,"A 30-day Metrocard is $127. Rather than charging $127 upfront, a customer can keep tapping at $2.75 a ride, but once they exceed $127 within a 30-day period, they would no longer be charged, same as if they had purchased a 30-day pass. Though this might be more complicated with the 18 minute lockout rule on the unlimited cards."
19,"I hope it works like the fare capping in London on the Oyster Cards. Some people can't afford to put $120+ on their Metrocard all at once for an unlimited, so they end up spending more with pay-per-ride. I hope that it'll automatically cap your OMNY once you've hit the daily/weekly/monthly limit. That would do a lot to help the poorest New Yorkers."
20,"Play or musical? Book of Mormon might be good, it’s the same people that did South Park"
21,"The NY Post covered this guy who had a $500k bill - for apparently no reason.

Maybe contact him and a reporter? Get an attorney?"
22,"My fiancé is born and raise New Yorker. Going to places that are very quiet, have houses with multiple entrances, and a distinct lack of people of color causes her anxiety and an inability to sleep."
23,"According to the Citizen app, fire in basement."
24,"Not sure how much this will help since apparently the cops sent by 311 don’t try to enter the building, but next time you hear abuse happening, call the local precinct and report it immediately.  They can’t really do anything about something that happened after the fact but if it’s a crime in progress, they’re more likely to send someone. Wait in your building lobby if you need to let them in.

Also, if you haven’t already, you can file a report to ACS and hopefully someone will come by, see the living conditions, and do something to help the kids.

25,Nobody cared who he was until he put on the mask.
26,"The lack of color is big topic in my relationship when returning to suburbs..   but backyards are a thing of glory.    

As I age, much as I adore NYC and never wanna leave, I could enjoy a Saturday without horns blowing constantly."
27,"Hopefully I am wrong for your sake, but I think the blood people stopped giving cash because people were using it for drugs."
28,"Where on the LES?

The further east you go, the further from the train you are. Also, the apartments may be older, smaller, and walk-ups."
29,"3 times a week on average. Early 30s, single. At this age you have to start putting in the effort to make things happen, you can’t wait around for people to invite you."
30,This is New York. Many many people do not have families at 36.
31,I will always advocate that these are better on a roll. And go to a bodega and eat it in a park... go watch the east river.
32,"I'd add that as a tourist it may be appropriate to tip some of the staff at your hotel. When you arrive at the hotel and check-in, if the bellhop helps you get your bags to your room, it's customary to give him a tip (I wouldn't do more than $3-5 unless it's a very fancy hotel or you have a ton of luggage). It's also acceptable to decline their assistance and take your bags up to the room by yourself.

In addition to that, if you take advantage of the services of the concierge to help you book restaurant reservations, buy tickets to a Broadway show, or anything like that, it's also customary to give them a tip (commensurate with the services they've provided).

Lastly, many people tip the cleaning staff at the hotel - you can just leave some cash in the room for them when you check out. Depending on the length of your stay it could be anywhere from $5 to maybe $20 if you're been at the hotel for a longer stay."

34,Pretend to currently be in ny.
35,"I would work with Lorne Michaels to decree that once a month, a random citizen could host SNL."
36,"If your renter's insurance doesn't cover this, you should get new renter's insurance, you're being scammed. Accidental water damage is a very, very basic component of renter's insurance."
37,"Just be careful holding your phone near the sensor if you’re not intentionally using OMNY. My Apple Pay went off when I was holding my phone kinda close to the sensor but was trying to swipe my metrocard. That’s the only downside for now, but it’s fast and I’m excited for when they have unlimited OMNY cards."
38,And recycling bins.
39,"Fastest? Use FedEx or UPS. You'll pay through your nose, but it'll get there in 24 hours.

Otherwise, use the postal service - a forever international stamp is $1.15, you stick it in a #10 envelope (the rectangular kind you can fit regular paper folded into thirds), and stick it in any of the blue USPS mail receptacles. It'll get there within 7-10 days."
40,Of course not - but many family members/friends look at relapse as a total failure without really understanding the process of recovery.
41,"I’m from toronto, live in nyc. all bars with TV’s will be showing the game, but there’s no real “toronto bar” or destination since the big leafs bar closed down last year. if you do find a spot, please share!"
42,Yes. Don't order from places that won't bring your food up; it legitimizes them.
43,i hide drugs in my circuit breaker panel
44,You want the real deal: Go to the Bodega thats closest to you. Thats how NYers do it.
45,"Mostly tenements, very few full-service/newer buildings, certain areas have challenging transportation."
46,"you share the room with 20 cockroaches, they all chip in with rent"
47,"I like it a lot. but it can make you nervous when you see all the crime and misfortunes happening in your neighborhood and around town,"
48,"If you're looking at finding cool artifacts and sea glass, Dead Horse Bay is your go to. Take the Q35 bus all the way down Flatbush and get off right before the Gil Hodges bridge. There's a trail off the road that leads to the beach. Go at low tide and you'll find tons of stuff from the early 1900s. Just don't take anything with you. It's protected federal land."
49,"I’m with you, 26, see friends maybe twice a month."
50,"Right there with you on fish, wouldn’t touch bodega fish for love or money. 

Honestly I just stick to the standard bacon egg and cheese on a roll."
51,"Uber/Lyft/etc. is sort of a grey area, I think. Up until a couple of years ago, these companies actually used as a selling point that your fare was all-inclusive and no tip was required. But the drivers protested, and the tip functionality was added to the app. So now the etiquette here is sort of unclear (to me, anyway). Personally, I err on the side of tipping, and leave at least a couple of dollars, but given the companies' earlier stance on this, it's understandable that some people disagree."
52,This is the only answer
53,"Make sure you sort this out ASAP and also please please check to make sure your property isn’t on the NYC lien sale list. NYC can put and sell a lien on any property that owes over 1K in water bills. 

FYI the lien sale deadline is July 19th...if you’re on that list you need resolution, full payment, or a payment agreement by then."
