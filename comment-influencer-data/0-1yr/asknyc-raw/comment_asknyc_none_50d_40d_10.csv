0,"The good news is that those monsters (American Cockroach) are usually not indicative of an infestation and are lone wolves, unlike german cockroaches which, upon seeing a couple, means you have a serious problem. They don't want to be there any more than you want them there and usually only come in during extreme periods of heat. A bait trap along the sides of the room is a good idea. Also Some diatomaceous earth around your door can help a lot so when they come in under the door that earth rips their bodies to shreds.  These big bastards usually come up from sink drains and shower drains. Closing them off when not in use is a good way to make sure they don't come back. Best of luck and here's to colder weather in the future."
1,"I always duck when I see a pigeon that looks like it's going to get too close to me. I don't care if people think it looks weird, I'm not letting a pigeon fly into my face."
2,"fyi once you have been touched by a pigeon, your transformation begins on the subsequent garbage day.

Half man, half trash bird, you will wander the streets seeking bread crumbs and human-sized ledges.

May you come to make peace with your curse."
3,take multiple showers a day
4,"The short answer is, yes, it's legal. The are no federal rules. New York State has no specific laws. OSHA has some recommendations, but no hard rules. I couldn't find anything specific to New York City."
5,Like badtouch?
6,I laughed so hard reading this post and all the comments. Now I am fearful for the bad pigeon karma I undoubtedly have coming my way.
7,Nah cold showers 100%
8,"The AC broke and they had it repaired as soon as the technician was available. This would be a different circumstance if this was the environment you were subjected to constantly as OSHA has standards for these kind of things. Shit happens, that's life."
9,"Here’s a few pointers from what I learned after ending an equally as long relationship:

- **Take time off. ** How much time? It doesn’t matter. Six months, a year, a few years. Whatever you need. Do not rush into another relationship! Hell don’t even *look* for dates. It’s time to date yourself for a while. 

- **Go to therapy.** We all think we don’t need it. But right now chances are you need it. You are dating yourself, remember? Consider this period as a way to upgrade yourself. Go to therapy to figure out what you need to unpack so you don’t carry the same stuff into your next relationship. 

-**Take advantage of being single.** Try new things. Dive into hobbies. Go on vacation.  Reconnect with old friends. Learn to do things you haven’t done before. Become a better version of you! When I got out of my relationship I joined the r/malefashionadvice reddit and did a complete wardrobe upgrade. I also hit the gym, and went to therapy. I dove into new hobbies. It took serious work but after a year l am a much better version of myself than I was before. 


If you do all the above you’ll find that dating will be incredibly easy because you will probably (a) meet someone through a new hobby, (b) feel more confident, (c) attract people who are also secure in themselves and working on their shit in therapy. 

Best of luck, bro!"
10,"I had the fan going all day and took a cold shower in the early afternoons. Didn't bother cooking or even making coffee for myself, there was no point in heating up the apartment or drinking anything warm. I planned my meals out, in air conditioned spaces, and tried to avoid traveling during the hottest part of the day. It was manageable, but I've also spent time living in the tropics with no AC so maybe I'm used to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did find myself out walking around, lugging baggage at like 2pm yesterday though and lasted only about 10 minutes before developing a headache from the heat, which felt super unusual for me and made me realize that maybe I had underestimated how bad it was. I ducked in to a Duane Reade for like a good thirty minutes and bought a drink, read all of the greeting cards, and perused every shade of nail polish they had until I felt cooled down enough to continue."
11,"I have 5 windows, corner unit so lots of wind. I also have a lot of trees. Still cried"
12,"LOL. THe other night I came home and saw a huge roach dart across the floor and under my bed. 

Like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, I slowly crept into my room with a loaded can of Raid balancing on my fingertips. 

I moved every piece of ski equipment and sacks of winter clothing and god knows what, as slowly as I could from under the bed. 

Finally the fucker made a run for it and I wasted him with a steady multi-round stream of roach poison as he darted under my couch. 

I found him belly up with my head lamp, covered his carcass with a paper towel and flushed him to his grave. 

Don’t worry OP, we all fight the good roach fight here in NYC."
13,Show me on this doll where he touched you.
14,"Not in NYC, but I’ve fed and held pigeons in other cities. You probably got in his way and he was too hot to give a fuck."
15,"Do you have AAA? 

I also heard (from a subreddit on here) calling certain credit cards and seeing if they have road side assistance sometimes gives you a free/discounted price! I think someone mentioned visa and Amex"
16,"One flew into my chest when I was about 19. Since that moment I have had no fear of man, god, or beast"
17,"just curious for those without A/C: why?  given how expensive it is to live in NYC, it seems like the incremental cost of getting an A/C unit would pale in comparison to the discomfort of surviving summers without one. asking seriously."
18,"Many thanks for the update — and glad you had fun!  I’m also glad of two things:  

(1) You had experiences that were meh or even kinda negative and didn’t let it color your whole view of the city.  We’re a city, not Disneyland, but some people forget that and think it’s going to be all amazing all the time.  It can be amazing.  It can also be shitty.  And it can be everything in between — and discovering the good, the bad, and the in between is half the damn fun!  So good on you.

(2). You found “your place.”  You know, the place you go back to, because it’s handy and decent and you like it there.  Now, a lot of people will be like “Gotham Pizza?” and suggest five other places that do it better — but fuck that noise.  That was your place, you liked it, you were happy... and that’s part of being here too.

So many thanks for visiting, glad you had a good time, and come back and see us again soon!"
19,"This is the busiest time of the year for AC service technicians. It is extremely difficult to get someone out there on weekends, especially on last minute notice. This becomes even more difficult if the building has a service / maintenance agreement with a specific company."
20,"I have a cat! He used to take out all of the palmetto bugs when we lived in Florida. I didn't even know we had any until we found bug bits in the kitchen one time. I've seen him snarf German cockroaches off the floor and catch flies in midair, so I do know he's capable of being an asset when he's awake.... which of course he wasn't during during my moments of paralyzing trauma last night.

Unfortunately, our place is so small that everything is near our bed."
21,I wouldn't expect them to follow any clothing care instructions and you shouldn't drop off anything you don't want to be washed/dried on high heat. They're just gonna do it as quickly and cheaply as possible.
22,There no rule mandating air conditioning.
23,"Get a cat. I get one or two of those monster roaches every month, and my cat ends up eating them before they can get anywhere near my bed."
24,"I tried to lookup the American cockroach on wikipedia to see if it is different than the Florida palmetto bug, so I could write a comment.

I was not prepared to see the pictures that loaded. It triggered my fear reflex and I threw my phone across the room.

No joke.

I’m so sorry experienced this. I hope and pray this never happens again and your bait traps and door sweeps works."
25,"Yes - I've been swatted by a pigeon wing once, shat on twice, and verbally harassed by a pigeon while it walked menacingly toward me many many times"
26,One pecked at my shoe and waddled off.  not sure if that counts.
27,sounds miserable
28,"I always do a staycation for one night every year with my wife.

We stay at a nice hotel with a rooftop pool and do a nice dinner. Drink all day at the pool."
29,"SAME. It could be several feet above me but if I see it coming my way, I hit the deck."
30,"I did that once in Washington Square Park. One pigeon was hanging out on my wrist and having a snack from my hand, and a second pigeon came over soon after to..... let's just say it wanted to have a little bit of fun with the first pigeon. I didn't sign up for that shit so I shook them off of my arm.

Scrubbed the hell out of it after I left the park, which I was going to do anyway, but lord. Apparently my arm is the hourly motel for pigeons."
31,I like this update a lot. It's refreshing to hear how someone's trip panned out instead of just the ask for advice part.
32,My bedroom had so many fans running it was like a wind tunnel!
33,I'm not sure I will ever recover from this tragedy but thank you for your kind words.
34,"Just act like you live in the same building together, and have a conversation. Knock on the door, or if you see your neighbor in the hallway, just politely mention that you can hear the kid late at night, so if they could just keep it in mind, you would appreciate it. Maybe they don't have carpeting down and that could be a simple fix. 

Better to bring it up and make that small effort rather than bite your lip."
35,"So ultimately your goal is to get rid of the bed bugs, but as for getting through the night you want to do a fast knock down.

*This is for a quick remedy, that is about 30 min worth of work but won't solve the infestation.*

1. Strip and bag bedding, and take to launder on the highest heat.

2. Vacuum everywhere around the bed. Use the crack and crevice attachment to get all the seams around the mattress and box spring. Make sure to hit the headboard.  Vacuum also the floor where it meets the baseboard. 

3. Place fresh sheets on.

If you aren't hiring a professional, here is what you need to do combined with the above steps .

1. Get bed bug encasements for your box springs.

2. Lay down a dust. Either food grade diatomaceous  earth or CimeXa. Use a paintbrush to push it into the cracks and crevices.

3. Get a single dose bottle of Temprid fx. It's about 13 dollars or so, it makes about a gallon diluted in water.  Make sure to read the label carefully on usage on how to treat, and spray accordingly.  Reapply after 7 days if needed. 

4. Launder your linens daily in high heat for the next two weeks making sure to always bag them in the room before taking them to the laundry. 

This should do it for you, though if the infestation came from a neighboring apartment, you may want to dust the shared walls by wall voiding.   A small hole drilled at the baseboard about every foot or so, and using a bellow for the dust  blowing into the wall. Then patch.

36,"Just as an FYI, I had shitty neighbors at my last place and constant construction next door so I got five or six infestations in the span of 10 years. As ion was like a miracle for all but the second to last time, when it did nothing. And it hadn’t gone bad since the remaining tube killed the roaches that showed up a year later. I think I just got a batch that we’re immune. What did kill them that one time was Bayer Maxforce FC gel."
37,He said he was married for 15 years.  How much less could there be?
38,"This is a good tip. I'll close all of our drains before I go to bed. I squirted some Advion in all of the vents to be safe, but I'll hit the FiOS cable hole above the door, too, just in case. 

Is there a chance it could have come from the AC unit? It's behind our bed and he ran back down that way."
39,That's how you crack yourself from thermal stresses.
40,"I was giving a tour of Washington Square Park years ago and as I was talking to my group, a pigeon flew and got its talon stuck on the shoulder strap on my jacket and started flapping his wings into my face like crazy. For a solid 8 seconds I got assaulted by a pigeon. It was Traumatic. I just dismissed my tour group after that..."
41,"Not a New Yorker but a New Orleanian, well Louisianian and I can tell you from my understanding y'all are getting a shit ton of heat and I also understand rain. That sometimes drives them in. When they come in they are most likely looking for water or to die. I HATE them with the firey passion of a gabillion suns myself and I have this particular scream that I do when I see one and hubby KNOWS that scream. I've used EVERYTHING from hairspray to febreeze etc to kill the sons of buggers. I tell ya the ones we get here are wearing sneakers, not the cheap ones you find at Wal Mart either I'm talking the three hundred dollar ones."
42,"First of all, pretty sure this is my worst fear and I am soooooo sorry ugh I don’t even know what I’d do. My building gets pretty frequent big cockroaches (I rarely see them in my apartment now because of my diligence with keeping things clean and usage of baits), but I’ve never seen one in my BED :(
nooooooooo

Two things I would suggest: 1) get a small spray bottle and fill it with rubbing alcohol. Keep it near your bed (or in the kitchen or wherever) and if you see a roach again, hit that fucker with two or three good sprays and I PROMISE it’ll die very quickly. No more working up the courage to smash them and much less cleanup. (and also v satisfying)

2) I noticed you have Advion and are getting glue traps, which should probably take out the big guy you saw - but I might also suggest getting a pack of Gentrol discs - this sterilizes any young roaches that come near it and will reduce the population."
43,Penn Station / Madison Square Garden and build a big elaborate public transportation hub that is worthy of the city. Replace the Manhattan Mall with the new MSG.
44,"/r/RideitNYC has some kind souls occasionally.     

How'd the gearshift lever break? Can you put a bolt in it if it's just where the foot hits or did the whole thing just break off? If so, can you pop start it and keep moving? Not in any position to help you, but just a rat biker without a bike for the moment that has improvised too much."
45,Anything trump owned.

47,"The US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s technical [manual](https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iii/otm_iii_2.html#5) recommends that indoor temperatures be in the range of 68-76 F (under section 3, chapter 2, part 5). As for an actual law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 states in section 5 (four page of [pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-84/pdf/STATUTE-84-Pg1590.pdf)) that a place of employment must be free of “recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees."
48,"Officer I was heading home and next time I know the pigeon grabbed my rear and asked me ""do you like that?"""
49,"Tinder is great. 

I personally recommend being single for a bit to get your head straight and to make sure you're thinking clearly."
50,"Currently in therapy (been to about six sessions) and I recently started going to a mens group — both have been beneficial. 

And I'm currently looking into hobbies. I don't even know what I like to do at this point — crazy that I've let it get like this. 

But I've been doing CrossFit for about 6-7 months now (4x/week) so that has been good. I'm not in shape but I'm also not out of shape anymore. 

I actually just bought some new clothes and donated some old stuff I've had for a long time. Plus, I lost a little weight so that helped convince me to buy some new things."
51,"&gt; These big bastards usually come up from sink drains and shower drains

Oh great, now *I'm* freaking out"
52,Move out of NYC first
53,"Yes, it is possible. No, there’s very little to no chance of it happening. The operator has something on his console called the “door enabler” one for each side of the train. Once the train comes to a complete stop, he must press it on the corresponding side, in order for the conductor to unlock the doors. Conductors are also required to point to the zebra board when the train stops after pulling into stations. You or the average NYer might not see it, but there’s a bit that goes into ensuring the doors are opened safely and on the correct side."
54,"Lol gentrification doesn’t mean it’s disneyworld, the LES is beyond gentrified."
55,"Winter storage, set-up pains, the shopping process (most decent ac window units are actually $200+), ruins a good window view, etc.

Idk, I’m trying to convince my partner we need a second unit for the bedroom but it hasn’t been an easy sell. He lists all the reasons I put above. 🤷‍♀️"
56,"Please do not send anyone to /r/legaladvice. Most of the people responding to questions are not lawyers. Very rarely, if ever, would you find an actual New York lawyer responding to a question. We talk about this frequently in the lawyers professional discussion sub, /r/lawyers which is specifically not for legal advice to the public.

There are plenty of free legal services programs in the city offering help from real lawyers."
57,"I know you're nervous and all, but you're reaaaally overthinking this. If you want groceries, you go to the store and grab groceries. If you want delivery, order delivery. Go out to eat, do whatever. There's no reason to spiral out over this. Not sure why you think your options will be so limited."
58,you motherfucker
59,"I kid you not, in the span of 2 weeks, both my husband and I were touched by pigeons, on two separate occasions.  He got it much worse than I did, because the bird literally hit him on the back of his head.  Mine was really weird...I was standing in line at a coffee shop that had huge windows, and the pigeon flew straight into the shop and ran into my arm.  The most annoying part was that everyone was so concerned about the bird, but no one bothered to ask me if I was alright."
60,"Cold showers, all the fans going and drinking water and frozen mixed drinks. I think piña coladas saved my life this weekend."
61,There are rules about maximum temperatures inside
62,"On top of that, think of how many other people probably had A/C issues over a hot weekend... they could have just already been entirely booked up with “emergency” appointments."
63,"Best: Living in New York City. 

Worst: Living in New York City."
64,A hot shower in the summer is the move.  You come out and everything feels all cool and you can tolerate the temp
65,"Yeah, I never understood this. A window unit is $120? I’m on the first floor and have bars on my bedroom window so I put it in my small kitchen window and it cools down my 1BR fairy nicely. Costs me an extra $35 on the electricity bill for a few months? How some people just decide to not have AC when it’s 100 degrees and humid is beyond me. Go out to eat one less time or skip the bar once, it’s insane. Unless there’s something I’m missing."
66,I got pooped on by one when I was a kid. no bueno. got attacked by one trying to steal my burger at shake shack in the park. the worst part was having to eat the burger after the bird touched it.
67,"This. Don’t jump into another relationship because it’s comfortable. Being single in NYC can be a lot of fun, enjoy it!"
68,Finding “your place” is so crucial in NYC though I’d never thought about it that way before. Just a spot that has the combo of stuff you care about and doesn’t require reading reviews or making reservations or whatever to enjoy.
