0,"Born and raised in NYC and metro area, and one of my fav things has always been how everyone will ignore you until you need help... and then suddenly 20 strangers passing by become your personal care team (as opposed to some other cities I’ve been where people will be super superficially friendly, but ignore you if you need help)."
1,"Definitely noticing longer wait times and more driver cancellations or drivers endlessly looping the block to force me to cancel. It's so prominent that Uber will now instantly look at what the driver was doing and waive the cancellation fee.

I suspect it's because every driver is working for all 3 (or more) services and constantly seeing which one will offer the best payoff. 

And not to mention traffic is so bad it's faster to walk and take the subway most of the time. I try to only use uber/taxis after midnight. Paying to sit in traffic with every other lemming is my own version of hell"
2,"I get sentimental every time I think about this one.

This summer I was very broke. Was headed to a show at Union Pool and decided to grab some cash and pop into Duff’s to pregame on the cheap. Was chillin In Duff’s and bought a round. Finished it and thought “hey I have about 30 mins before showtime I’ll get one more round”.

Reached in my pocket and realized. WTF! I had no more cash. I had withdrawn money from the BOA down the street but NOT TAKEN THE MONEY!!!. 

I take off sprinting out of duff’s to the BOA. See 3 people walking out and I’m like “yeah that money’s fucking gone”.  And... it was fucking gone.

Defeated I take more money out and head back over Duff’s. Gotta take the edge off after a debacle like that. 

Walk up to the bar and say “hey I’ll take a beer and a shot”. 

Some random dude sitting at the bar at Duff’s: “hey man were you just in BOA?”

Me: yeah...

Dude: You dropped this cash. Here you go. I saw it on the ground and tried to find you but didn’t see anything. So glad I ran into you. 

I flipped out, almost cried and bought whatever he wanted.

I moved here from the southeast and can think of little other places on earth where someone would be that kind and honest."
3,"Yes it’s normal adult life and yes I think it’s also NYC that’s exhausting. I’ve lived my typical 40 hr work/friends/SO/exercise/etc week in several places and I personally think some combination of the absolute bullshit of the trains, inevitably dealing with rude and/or oblivious people while out and about, etc makes it harder here. And the weather sucks right now. "
4,"That is 100% enough to call 311 for. In fact, calling 311 is smart because then you have an official record of your complaint. But yes, talking to your landlord directly is a great idea; if I were the landlord, I'd be pissed at my super for doing a shitty job and putting my tenants in a fire hazard situation."
5,"100% agree. NYC is the best place to be when you need help or shit goes sideways - it's a city full of over-achieving, action-oriented, no-bullshit kind of people"
6,"Tip well. Delivery guy is working because he needs money.     

I usually just add an extra $5 for inclement weather on a normal delivery, but for really nasty shit (like 4x what we have today) an extra $10.   "
7,"Ladies like to compliment me on the street. Whether it’s my make up or my clothes or handbag. Someone asked me if I was a professional makeup artist. Or I get told that I look like a celebrity. Just really nice comments. Women here love complimenting each other and asking where you bought something. I have lived in other countries and that’s not a thing anywhere else, trust me. In other countries if you look nice women will give you dirty looks. NY women really like to compliment other women and they’re confident enough to not feel threatened. They’re so secure in themselves. They also like receiving compliments. I told a girl I liked her leather pants and she was like “THANK YOU. I dress for other women. If I get compliments I feel so good.” 

I think that’s really nice tbh. Some compliments have really made my day. And it happens often. Also women have helped me if I’m lost or looking for an address. It’s definitely a lie that everyone here is rude. "
8,Many more small business occupying storefronts. Times Square was a bit dicey after dark. I used to see prostitutes on my way getting driven to school and exiting the West Side Highway in the low West 20's. Subways took tolkens. I could count the times I went to Brooklyn before my 18th birthday on one hand. Everything was cheaper.
9,"Traffic was at a complete stop in Harlem, so we took turns getting out, walking to a nearby cafe, buying coffee and taking a leak, and coming back. We were at 96th and Broadway a good 20 minutes, so it was very doable. "
10,The drivers looping the block thing is the MOST infuriating thing to me. I am glad Uber has finally started to recognize it's happening but it doesn't make it less annoying to experience it. 
11,yesterday? im still commuting now!
12,"A lot of the stories you hear from pan handlers on the subway aren't true.

Anthony on the 1 train has been supporting his 5-year-old Andre and 2-year-old Anthony Jr for six years."
13,Brooklyn cat cafe needs very temporary foster homes for the week of thanksgiving while they relocate to their new space 
14,"It also doesn't help that we aren't really surrounded by much real nature. We are constantly underground, spending most of our time working in a building, going back underground, staying in our apartments or just in general being indoors all the time. It's really depressing to be honest. 

"
15,Start with the park closer to where you live. Go up in Harlem one day and walk around. Or randomly jump on a train and get off after 15 stations. You'll find something interesting there. 
16,"I feel bad for the delivery guy, but he's gonna be out either way (people always order in when it's snowing) so I tip extra to compensate"
17,"Upper East Side, near 2nd avenue. It's all bars and restaurants, not too expensive rent, and your commute to midtown is 15 minutes, max. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live off the 96th street Q and work in midtown and I usually get to work in 12 minutes flat. "
18,"I moved here a couple years ago and wanted the same thing. I made an exhaustive list with the help of my coworkers:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9MCTBITcrkYxA93fY-0gQOaGuNrELZeuk8m86bK1R4"
19,"I sneak in a walk during the middle of my workday.  It helps me feel better.

Will also second the alcohol comment.  I decided to cut way back in drinking about a year ago, and I feel so much better.  I think people on NYC tend to drink more than in other places because we don’t have to worry about driving."
20,"Bagels.

Bagels with egg.

Bagels with egg and cheese.

Bagels with egg and cheese and bacon. "
21,"Very happy with my Patagonia parka, been serving me well trying to get home today.."
22,"What happened is that the weather people didn't act like a Snowpocalypse was coming, so not too many people took it seriously, including the city.

Generally when the weather people warn about really bad weather, a lot of people either stay home, leave early, or at least take public transportation instead of driving. Yesterday everybody acted like it was just a normal day. I saw a girl walking around in the snow in flip-flops.

On top of that, the city's response to the snow was delayed."
23,"A small thing, but one time my wallet fell out of my pocket and I didn't notice for about 15 minutes.  Retraced my steps and couldn't find it anywhere.  I was about to give up hope when I got a Facebook message out of the blue from someone who had found my wallet, looked me up on Facebook using my drivers license, and waited around nearby to give it back."
24,"Remembering when I worked as a delivery guy. Crap weather day. Orders keep coming in. I really don’t care, more orders more money. I reached my misery threshold anyway - after that it doesn’t get any worse, just makes the shift go faster. There are only so many orders I can deliver per hour regardless. As more come in I try to combine stops - take 3-4 orders per trip. But stops 3 and 4 will take longer. Food colder. That time when from customer POV delivery time is slow, but from mine the tips are fast. That is what I am going for, and if bad weather is what it takes.. 

I see you carefully crafted your order to be only one dollar above minimum, if you then also tip me $2 you have a high chance to be stop 4 in the future. I have a mental list of bastards that only call in inclement conditions, but if you a regular I won’t even notice you called in the rain. If I did 3 trips to your place the last 6 months I probably recognize you. Often I even know the address just by looking at the contents of the order. Bad weather people tip a bit more, but it is unpredictable. Then also it is often about the size of the order. Small $15 or so orders are depressing, same trip as a $40 order. Calling a place for the first time with a minimum amount on a bad weather day is going too far on a first date. But for a good tip she ok with it. Then again an order from a good tipping regular is always welcome."
25,I think what you are describing is called being an adult.   Just wait until you have kids. 
26,"70% of 'marketing' jobs are door to door sales positions.

Don't touch the CDs guys are trying to hand out around midtown.

Fake monks. 

These are the simplest ones that I've run into in the past couple of years. The CD I 'donated' 10$ for was actually pretty interesting. "
27,"In some ways, it was kind of awesome - kids could do anything with the fakest fake ID's that you could buy in Times Square.. my friends and I went to the top night clubs in manhattan, to Jamaican dance hall clubs, went to stand up comedy clubs and ordered drinks and nobody cared that we were so obviously under age except the standup comic who made jokes about us ...   But yeah, also gangs and gang fights.  People getting jumped for their shoes or jackets if they were worth taking.  A family friend of my family got shot on a playground over some dispute from a basketball game.

&amp;#x200B;

NYC Radio was better, the city was dirtier and grittier - more street drug dealing, hookers out in the open.  The bowery was full of flop houses and CBGB's was still going.  The east village and the lower east side were fully hardcore.  Heroin addicts were nodding off a lot more.  There were still empty lots full of bricks from demolished buildings in the Bronx and Harlem.  Brooklyn was just insane, my family never went there, we were from Manhattan.

The subways were so covered with graffiti that you couldn't see out the windows, so at every stop people had to lean to see out the doors when they opened so as to know what stop it was."
28,Randoms on the street selling tickets for the Staten Island ferry when it’s supposed to be free
29,"Honestly, I don't know it's name or where it is. I just know that it appears at 2am when I'm sauced, and that it's never too late for English breakfast. "
30,"Park Slope in the 80s: Crack vials in the sidewalk; I thought it was called ""crack"" because you saw them in the cracks of the sidewalk. Half my block was burnt out vacants. It wasn't all white people and the thanksgiving potluck at PS 321 was off the chain. 

You definitely wouldn't enter a city park at night. I would avoid subways at night into the early 90s, unless I was in a large group. A lot of the subways still didn't have air conditioning, and when the electrical shoe lost contact with the 3rd rail, the whole car would go dark.  You would just sit in the hot darkness during delays. The MTA would say there was a ""smoke condition"" but everyone knew it meant ""track fire.""  

You looked forward to the next ""If its Out There, Its In Here"" ad for NYNEX Yellow pages (visual puns, [example seen here](https://twitter.com/MrsPrester/status/1008725842996989954), they would appear for a month without their caption and you'de try to figure it out) and the latest in the AIDS-education saga of [Julio &amp; Marisol](http://secondavenuesagas.com/2012/09/06/a-ride-back-in-time-with-julio-and-marisol/). 

&amp;#x200B;"
31,"pretty much this. the absolute best places are the ones you accidentally find on your own. especially in NYC. you get on a train, you ride it for a while, then you get off and walk around with no real purpose except to explore. you follow that street, then you turn at the next corner, walk a few blocks, and try to keep from taking too many right turns...and even if you go in circles, it doesn't matter.

I like walking around in NYC (mostly Manhattan, but parts of BK too) and just try to get lost. I've found some amazing things that way."
32,"Traveling for a diner seems kind of against the point, I love my diner because it's across the street and open until really late"
33,Try being completely sober for a month. It was eye-opening for me how much quality sleep I lost due to even small amounts of alcohol.
34,"Ah man, I thought this was gonna be a real question about an allegedly haunted apartment, not just one in unlivable disrepair."
35,"Sounds like the easiest solution might be to install window screens. If your landlord won't put in real ones, you can buy [expandable window screens that you can put in yourself](https://www.homedepot.com/p/W-B-Marvin-19-33-in-W-x-10-in-H-Wood-Frame-Adjustable-Window-Screen-AWS1033/202088349). They're not the most secure or good-looking, but they're extremely inexpensive and will get the job done."
36,Sleep No More. I’ve been three times now. It’s such a cool experience. 
37,Seeing The Book of Mormon. By far one of the best experiences of my life.
38,"“These conditions are unlivable!”



“We will be staying here indefinitely!”"
39,"So the driver will be , for purposes of example, 2 minutes away and you can see them approaching via the map. Suddenly though, instead of taking a right to head up the avenue I live on, they will continue straight. Ok, maybe they saw something on the avenue and are taking an alternate route, they'll make the next turn. Except they don't do that, they continue driving around aimlessly never actually turning towards my apt. I usually cancel after trying to call the driver, which goes ignored."
40,"I wasn't in the traffic last night, but related story. My now husband and I had to drive from here to Newport, RI at 12pm for a funeral and back to NYC in the same day. We also had to rush back to make sure the car rental was returned before they closed. Of course, there was a snow storm.

Anyway, my husband was driving and I had to pee SO badly, but we couldn't stop. I (girl) peed into a cup (very hard) in the back seat, but then we had to dispose of it. We were in the left most lane, and I was too embarrassed to pour it out the window in case other cars might see it - so my husband took the cup from me and poured it out his side. That was one of the moments I knew I wanted to marry him :)"
41,"Really glad you did this, but this is also a really good way to get stabbed. "
42,"&gt; I think we are going to renew our lease for another year.

Umm... why??"
43,"I was having a terrible day full  and spent it crying my eyes out. About my job. If I was ever going to publish my book. If I was good enough to get a job in web development. Went to go get some ice cream with my eyes puffy, nose runny, and the guy serving me gave it to me for free. Big Gay in East Village, thank you, you saved me from giving up on myself."
44,Bars still close at 4am.
45,If you are trapped in your apartment call fire department.
46,"Ohhhhh, I’ve got a story for you....

About 3 years ago I was riding back on the L Train to Brooklyn and some scruffy looking homeless guy gets on the car and starts his story about how he needs another $13.78 to get a bus ticket back to Montana and how he has a job waiting for him at a ranch and all of that, so feeling for him, I took out the last $15 I had in my wallet and handed it over. Fast forward about 2 years and who gets on my car on the L? You guessed it. 

I don’t let him get three words deep before I jump up and yell, “NOPE! No! Fuck you man, fuck this guy, don’t give him a fucking cent! I gave you my last $15 2 years ago to get you on that bus to Montana because I felt bad and you’re still here?! What the fuck happened to your ranch job you lazy piece of shit? Did you drink that away like you did my money?! Get the fuck off the train because if you get on another car, I’m going to tell them the same story.” And true to my word I followed him on to the next car at the next stop and he never opened his mouth, he left the station at the next stop, but I’m sure he just waited for the next train. 

The absolute look of horror that came across his face before I was even done saying nope told me that’s happened to him before and he knew what was coming. The looks on the other passengers faces told me that they were happy they got to see someone finally get called out. 

Fuck you, L Train rancher. Oh, and while I’m at it...fuck you to you, loud “navy veteran who served your country, fought for your country, but thankfully didn’t die” no one wants your baseball cards or pins and we don’t have to look at you when you show them to us, so stop yelling at girls and asking, “if anyone is home.”"
47,Rent. 
48,"If your car breaks down on the highway and a tow shows up saying they were called by the police, it's a scam. Call the cops yourself and have a NYPD tow come. You won't get price gouged. 

Experienced a $900 bill from a ""licensed"" tow company."
49,Black Friday is a scam.
50,wine &amp; cheese tasting experience at murray's cheeses
51,"If it's shitty out, sure. "
52,"Walk right past anyone trying to sell you on electricity plans of any kind. Especially if they are knocking on your door or soliciting outside of a high-traffic business. Look up ESCO scams and keep moving.

Keep walking past the stuntman groups. Sometimes they'll try to rope you or others into participating. Keep moving, they're experts at separating tourists from their cash.

The best defense against a scam is to practice your 'fuck off I'm busy' face and don't stop moving."
53,Yup. You'll have a new door (opening) in about 5-10 min after the call is made.
54,I agree. I feel that way with Lyft also. They used to be a normal part of my commute but it got SO bad that no amount of refunds/credits could make up for the hassles. It’s especially irritating when I get a cancellation fee when they assign me a different driver (happens a lot now!!) who’s 10 minutes away instead of 3. Argh. 
55,A museum membership like for the Tenement Museum
