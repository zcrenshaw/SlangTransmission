0,You get robbed every month you pay the rent
1,"You probably won’t get robbed or stabbed or shot, but everything is so expensive now. Like, not just rent, but everything."
2,"It’s all over NYC, not just Midtown East. "
3,"Definitely do not pull the emergency brake. In this situation, you can tell a station agent in a booth the car number (it is in white numbers on black stickers on the car) that someone is harassing someone and being threatening in the car."
4,"[Doomed: Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die](https://nypost.com/2012/12/05/a-picture-of-controversy/)"
5,ayy im spittin here
6,Dishwasher.
7," better cleaner, safer, no gun violence or muggings. Lots people from different places.  Less racial segregation.  The bike lanes are nice.  Most of the parks are no clean and usable.  Graffiti is gone.
Worse? Gentrification has driven locals out.  Large swatches of the city are now Wall Street ""Dude-Bro"" wastelands, most mom &amp; pop , owner operated establishments are gone or on the way out to be replaced with sterile chain stores. Lots and lots more cars and no place to park them. Cops &amp; fireman don't live here anymore so they  don't co-exist with the people they serve.  Subways are headed back to the bad old days.  Bad service and full of filthy deranged people. Much less of a working middle class.  Big wealth gap.  The super-rich used to contribute to the city (WOOLWORTH Building, CARNEGIE hall, MORGAN Library), now they just take"
8,"Yes. There are statistics that back it up. 

People in NYC generally are career focused, especially in their 20s/30s, and many people need to live with multiple roommates to afford the city. So things like having kids are delayed. "
9,"Its everywhere, its terrible honestly. NYC is meant to be creative not just Duane Reads, Urgent Cares and Banks. Smith street in Downtown BK lost a lot of good places too."
10,"Favorites: Williamsburg, Long Island City, Hamilton Heights. 

I lived in Williamsburg when gentrification was starting to ramp up, but nowhere where it is now. We still had cheap places to eat, and cooler/more interesting bars to drink in. LIC was about the same but quieter and much less in the way of nightlife. Hamilton Heights had pretty much zero night life, but is the most beautiful place I've ever lived. Riverside park, huge old trees and gorgeous brownstone blocks were lovely to walk through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Least Favorite: Bushwick, Morgan stop. I actually live here now. While there is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat and drink, it feels like I'm trapped in a hipster amusement park. Literally zero families or even adults live in my immediate neighborhood and there are basically no trees. That and since it's a sleepy block, people actually dump toxic trash here on occasion. I would move, but I have the deal of a lifetime on a circa 1917 loft space that should cost 4x what I pay so... yeah. "
11,You sound like you need sleep. Sorry bud
12,Taking a flight out of JFK or Newark? forget the cab and lines at security - take a helicopter from midtown manhattan straight to the terminal!
13,"My mom was in a similar situation with her downstairs neighbor. She ended up speaking to the lady's daughter, who stopped by every once in a while to check in. Apparently she wasn't completely aware that her mother was screaming throughout the night, so they ended up prescribing some anti-anxiety meds for her which seemed to help."
14,"Less pollution 

No porn in full view everywhere 

Better food


Can’t think of anything that’s worse"
15,"This is exactly the reason I get so worked up every time a thread on reddit comes up about not taking shoes off in the house. The overwhelming majority of people in the other subreddits who say they walk with shoes in their house because there's no visible mud on their shoes... Yeah, that's not why I'm leaving my shoes at the door."
16,"I hear you girl.. Im sorry to say it happens all the time. I cant tell you how many times i have been accosted by crazy people, young school kids, preachers, and degenerates. STAND UP. DO NOT ENGAGE. LEAVE. TELL A POLICE OFFICER or MTA EMPLOYEE.

In the case if the white girl, rather than engage him- you should have supported her. When women stand together usually men like this scare off(I have seen this happen). Its ok. You were scared. 

I carry a small knife JUST IN CASE. Stay Safe!"
17,"I don't think this is new.  Parents are just older in NYC, or at least in Manhattan.  I have kids in school, so I see who the other parents are, and they are not (for the most part) people who had kids in their 20s.  You need money to have kids in NYC, and that's hard to do when younger."
18,"Worst: East Village 1977~1982.

Best: East Village 1982~2012

Worst: East Village 2012~present."
19,"You can rent out locations for the right price. Imagine having a party or just your own time at the Mets temple of dendur, or under AMNH’s blue whale, of NYBG’s conservatory."
20,"The loss of mom and pop stores is a BIG negative, IMO."
21,"Honestly, that's not *that* bad."
22,Rent increase is proving to be too much for mom and pop stores. In Washington Heights there's tons of closed stores that have been that way for months and a few for years. (Theres literally an empty store space by my children's school that no one seems to want to rent out and has been empty for years)  No one can make the rent except large chain stores but i think they feel they wont make much profit in low income areas so they stay away. Its a real sad situation.
23,"I think the law is 7 am. Or maybe 6? They were jackhammering at a school across the street from me for over a year and always started 15 minutes before the legal time. I reported it and it actually worked, gaining me an extra 15 minutes of sleep."
24,Dude word. I was walking around 2nd and St Marks on Thursday. Didn't realize so many stores were closing down. It's kind of scary.
25,"You did exactly the right thing: you left the dangerous situation.

I trained in self defense and the whole point of every move you learn is to be able to safely exit the situation and then call the police. If pepper spray or a knife would help you feel more confident next time, then get them and practice using them (not on a person). But don't beat yourself up. It's not reasonable to expect you to be a hero and take on someone twice your size to help someone else out, whether or not you had a self defense weapon."
26,"I had to ask myself where the hell is Liberty airport and then learned that's the name of Newark.  TIL

Lived here for 22 years.

The cheapest is not the fastest.  The cheapest is to take the AirTrain, then NJ Transit to Penn, then walk to the B/D train at 34th Street.

Quickest:  Uber"
27,"NYPD Hercules Unit

""The Hercules unit is an elite, heavily armed, semi-tactical police unit that appears out of thin air on a daily basis around the city. This unit can be found at the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, or the stock exchange — wherever the day's intelligence reports suggest they could be needed."""
28,"All over the country* 

We’re moving towards a homogenous world where everything’s a chain "
29,"pro:  things are cleaner, more modernized, things like that.

con:  things are way more homogenized.  which is easy and comfortable, but as others have said, it seems like the city has lots a lot of small businesses.  (and when i say small,i mean like individually or family-owned businesses).

something neither good nor bad:

used to be when i was a kid taking the subway each morning to hs, you'd hear a gentle rustling of paper as people spread out and folded the paper and read it as they sat down.  the view of morning commuters (myself included) reading the paper is done and gone.

for better of worse it's staring at phones and SHOWTIME."
30,"If you have some free time, go to the museum at 9am before they are open and get on the ticket line. Be the first one in there and speed walk *directly* to the whale (2nd floor) or the dinosaurs (4th floor). Those rooms are far enough that the wandering tourists wont get there too quickly and you'll have it all to yourself for about 15 minutes. Its MAGICAL."
31,"Go to ABC Carpet just north of Union Square. Most of their rugs are insanely expensive. But if you go downstairs to their bargain basement, it's another world. Lots of beautiful, unique rugs often at incredibly low prices.

I've bought some great rugs from them for $200 or less. No idea how they set their pricing (dart board?), but there are some great options there."
32,"When I worked for the DOE in East New York, there was a garden that was never open, until the summer, there was an older guy that loved it, and cared for it a ton.  Stopped to chat with him one day and he told me all about it, even INSISTED I take some produce with me. Went out on my lunch break the next day with some tools and a couple bags of soil and got my hands dirty. Definitely a rewarding experience"
33,"Being born and raised in this city what’s changed for the better? To be real, the crime actually went down I feel safe to walk in certain neighborhoods, Deli’s on every corner, believe it or not MTA actually improved, back then the trains were much more terrible and there’s no explanation from mta as to why the trains were slow or late, the worse  thing to happen? Nyc still has a culture to it that will never go away but the yuppies aka gentrified neighborhoods if you ever go to one.. are all the same with the same stores and same kind of restaurants.. and it’s so over priced that now every neighborhood that I been too that’s not been touched by gentrified wants to be like park-slope and Williamsburg so they can  get there store value to go up more and more so they can sell once it does get touched by gentrification... another worse thing to happen is the living situation in nyc, it’s too expensive and it’ll only get more and everything is going up in prices."
34,"Favorite: UWS. Very much the city but less crowded than downtown. Central Park and Riverside are both amazing. Tons of culture. 

Worst: Chinatown. I was on Mott St. Smelly, crowded, loud, annoying. 

Second worst: Hells Kitchen. I had to get on and off at the Times Square stop. Nuff said. "
35,People act like the random street cart by their workplace is going to be any better than Halal Guys. Halal Guys is definitely above the average street cart in terms of taste.
36,"Better question - who here bought a place on one salary without help from extended family? 

Who did it with college debt? "
37,Lmao Halal Guys is the Taco Bell of halal food so anyone who says it’s the best is most likely inebriated.

I don't even."

41,Isn’t being outside the antithesis of a speakeasy?
42,A bunch of ignorant white trash racist heroin addicts. 
43,"Stop, hammer time!"
44,"Yep, but that’s for  regularly scheduled construction. But if something like a water main breaks at midnight, all bets are off. They don’t have to wait until 7 AM to start fixing it."
45,NYC Adult Protective Services.
46,"I'd report the Landlord to the Real Estate Board of NY as well - if the building is over six units, he cannot legally discriminate."
47,"It's not all over the country. NYC has some of the highest, if not the highest, commercial rent in the country hence nobody can afford to keep stores open. High commercial rent and high residential rents kill cities."
48,I lived in Astoria for four months and I think I gained 10 pounds.  THE FOOD!!!  I loved it.
49,"Of all the places in the world to be 37 and single, NYC might be the best one."
50,No advice other than contractors never show up on time or complete work to the timeline promised.  Also if you plan on slowly renovating are you ok with living in a construction site for years on end.

53,"Favorite: east village / stuy town - awesome selection of restaurants, parks, bars, cafes etc, and still not super expensive.  As long as the L is running it's a pretty quick subway commute to anywhere


Worst: Penn station area-. Doesn't even have a neighborhood name. West side in the 30's outside of Hudson yards.  A long walk to anythung interesting and really no good parks or  recreational stuff unless you want to walk all the way down to chelsea.  Your probably going to use Penn station for getting around and Penn station has a habit of inducing depression and misanthropy.  "
54,"I'm 39 and only half my NYU friends are married and even fewer with kids.  Although the baby carriages are certainly multiplying as we head into our late 30s/ 40's and people freak that it will be too late to start. 

I have two kids (my 2nd is 8 weeks old) and I think I'm one of two who actually stayed in the city after two kids.  Everyone else went to the suburbs.  The commute just isn't worth it to us at this time.  

However I live in Queens in a very family-friendly area and while certainly people are having kids later like in Manhattan, multiples are a bit more common. "
55,I never thought about the cops/firemen thing. That's unfortunate to think about.
56,"Well the the Cops can stand in front of me and protect me when some guy is trying to kill or rape me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh wait, they won't"
57,We had a company event under the blue whale. Holy crap.
58,"That's a lot of words to just say ""Yes it's a cult"""
59,"Cons: No subway, steep hills, murder clowns

Pros: Amazing Sri Lankan food"
60,SI is the only Republican borough and it’s inhabitants especially south shore have a rep of being racist and homophobic. 
61,"This stuff happens all. the. time. in our buildings.  Usually someone lets the super know or the building manager and we call APS (adult protective services).  I think they can do wellness checks and can assess whether someone is in need of assistance.  They can assign a case worker, get in touch with family, get someone set up with a nursing home if needed, etc.  Also sometimes in these situations, the person is living in conditions that are not good for their health (we had a dude whose apartment was just covered almost floor to ceiling in mildew.  We would have and did fix it as soon as we found out but without the guy notifying us, we had no idea!).  In my opinion, it can't hurt in this situation to have someone check in on him just to make sure he's doing okay.

It's something we don't always think about all that often but there are a number of elderly people with little or no surviving family or friends and sometimes they end up in a bad spot and it's so easy for them to slip through the cracks.  There are some amazing city services available to at least try to bridge the gap and for people who need them, it's essential.  We have of course, unfortunately, had several cases of people who end up passing away in their apartments with nobody noticing until a neighbor alerts us to an odor.  It's a terrible and very sad thing for everyone involved."
