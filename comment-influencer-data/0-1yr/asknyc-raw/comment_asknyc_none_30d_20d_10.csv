0,"I delivered in NJ in 2006 and the EOB from insurance said they got billed $53,000 (21 hours of labor, unscheduled c-section, and four days in hospital for both of us). 

Insurance paid $14,500."
1,"People are entitled to love whatever foods they like, but for what its worth, I think these bagels are awful - bready and flavorless and not what bagels are supposed to be at all."
2,"&gt; The biggest issue here is whether or not the washer is in the lease

Um, a lot of things like toilets and refrigerators are 'not in the lease' but its expected the LL respond to maintaining them.

If the apartment was rented out with a washer/dryer it is the LL's responsibility to maintain them."
3,"No, unless you have someone in NYC keeping an eye out for your interests you should be paranoid about renting places without being able to see them."
4,"Okay, thank you. Good advice! I don't plan on withholding rent. I think that's a bit dramatic over a washing machine. The lease says he is liable."
5,I like Follia
6,Tompkins for sure
7,"Here is a Yelp search
https://m.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Top+15+Romantic+Restaurants+Nyc&amp;find_loc=Dyckman+St%2C+New+York%2C+NY"
8,Casper + UberX and you're good.
9,"Insurent. It's a 3rd party guarantor. A lot of buildings will accept it. You pay them a fee (usually 1 month's rent) and they act as your guarantor. You have to show bank statements that have i think 50x monthly rent in the bank account. So if you find a 1br for 3k a month, you need to have a bank account with 150k in it. Or you could find a landlord/building management who is willing to take 3-6 months rent upfront."
10,"Try this website.

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/immunization-clinics.page"
11,How about [New Leaf](https://www.newleafrestaurant.com/)?  It is inside Fort Tryon Park.
12,No contest; best bagels I've had in NYC.
13,Best Bagels in Manhattan is the best bagels in Manhattan. Partial to Brooklyn Bagels or Toast and Roast in Astoria.
14,"Used car, learn to work on it yourself.  Insurance (liability only = $50 per month).  No lease payment.  Maybe another $50/mo for repair budget."
15,"I was treated for pediatric leukemia at NYPresbyterian. Wonderful treatment, this isn't to bash them, but my bill was over 6 million. I believe every night in the hospital is approximately 1000 just for a bed, then there are hundreds of dollars of fees on top of that. Blood transfusions cost about 400 dollars. I see how it could build up so quickly."
16,Best Bagel and Coffee?
17,"Do not scold me.  

It was a suggestion as an alternative.  Women decide to use midwives, duenas, etc, all the time.  Of course one should research it and make their own decisions."
18,It's def the best bagel place in the area
19,"Not entirely related, but good luck!"
20,Luv them but wish they were bigger lol
21,Any recommendations in midtown - I could use one at lunch these days
22,"My time has come. Hands down whenever we go to Manhattan we eat Ess-a-Bagel. 
IMPORTANT TIP: you can eat bagels fast if you go all the way down the 2 lines. There’ll be a list of all the bagel options. All of them are amazing. Best plain bagel I ever had and everything is really good. It’s a bit salty unless you apply lots of cream cheese. Ok cream cheese, there’s ton of flavors. Conventional plain white is still good but my favorite is the blueberry. Chocolate is also great. PRO TIP: bring a scissors if you’re not eating inside so you can eat it fresh in your car and apply a nice helping of cream cheese. Ok the long lines outside are for the other options like the signature bagel and other stuff. IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. So good you want to wait on the line for more but you feel so satisfying that you don’t need to. Hope you try it out. Actually don’t you’ll clog the line further never mind then."
23,The Met isn’t free. They ended that. If you’re a resident you pay what you want but tourists have to pay full price.
24,I wouldn't call nolita quiet
25,"Right? I’m still a little torn, one party says to check it out and see how I feel once I get there and the other was like don’t even bother, then there’s Reddit, and me being lazy not to make the effort to go all the way there"
26,Linda’s stuff
27,"Weird, my friend was able to call in a reservation for our dinner!"
28,"We just moved back to the city, and while Bagel Bob’s wasn’t the only reason we chose to live in Yorkville, it certainly came up in the discussions."
29,"Wildman Steve Brill does some interesting foraging walks in NYC Parks - we just did Inwood/Fort Tryon.

Also, The Jersey Palisades are really nice and feel more removed from the City

[https://www.njpalisades.org/directions.html#public](https://www.njpalisades.org/directions.html#public)"
30,"You mean like ""as time goes on, the price of rent ever-rises, and it is possible I will be priced out of NYC""?

Yes."
31,"I've gone to Spice before and love the food, but I do find it kind of loud due to how popular it is."
32,A 2BR for only $1500 probably is *inside* a gold mine.
33,"This might help

https://www.laguardia.edu/CE/Pages/Career-Skills-and-Training/Electrical-1-Training-Program/"
34,"Louie and Ernie’s, Emilio’s of Morris Park"
35,"Damn, a two-bedroom for $1500. That's a gold mine."
36,RI is basically the last place I would suggest someone worries about the UES being too boring. It's like being in a different place then NYC entirely.
37,Agreed.
38,I go to Zaro's in GCT on the way to my office on 42nd and Broadway. Am I doing it wrong?
39,dunkin
40,"Overpriced as fuck but yes the only good option. 

It's kind of incredible when you think about it."
41,Yes. It's one of a few reasons why we are trying to buy a coop ASAP.
42,"The good: I can get fat from all the Trader Joes I want now. Everything is here (except Wal-Mart). I can get excited and visit Harlem and some areas of Brooklyn without much concern. A mixed bag, so many different people/cultures of course.

The bad: Probably the same for other East Coasters, but wow the weather lately? Wondering if we'll even have a fall season. And if so, that it'd be longer than 2 wks. Subways are too crowded. 

The ugly: The LES was already a bit ""different"", but will continue to change in a way that makes it such a cliche. You won't be able to call it hip anymore. The construction will never end. People will continue to move in. Soon people will be pushed out if not already. Don't want to leave my apt and surround myself with all of the false individuals that overtook my community. Suddenly feel like an alien where I grew up. Nothing seems fun anymore even though there's so much to do. It all feels played out. Everything is sparkly and new until it becomes repetitive. Not only here. Everywhere in the city."
43,"Lowerline. Owner’s from Louisiana, really knows his stuff. 

Hands down, as good as what we make at home!"
44,Bagel Oasis is also 24/7/365 which is a massive massive boon.
45,"For sure, if I ever get another car again I'm getting a cheap used one and paying with cash."
46,"I believe that [free days at museums](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/museums/free-museum-days-in-nyc)  is the most up to date listing for right now but always check the the museums website before going!
Enjoy your visit!"
47,"That's true. My smart friends did that, but most people I knew had a minimum of a $250/mo payment. Their excuse would be, ""I spend so much time in my car I want a nice one""."
48,No
49,i think it’s $5 and they take cards on board now too.
50,Sucks about the Met! I haven't been in a while. I guess I won't be going again anytime soon.
51,Yeah
52,"Both Cloisters and 9/11 cost money.

The folk art museum is free."
53,A well-tipped super can become your best friend and make your life so much better.
54,"Just to make explicit what this thread is implying: it is not possible to get to LGA without using a bus, except by using a car."
55,I have tried head hunters with no luck.
56,Ex-lawyer here working in marketing in an Am Law 50 firm. DM me.
57,"If you’re an attorney with 9 years big/serious in house experience and you’re not getting bites, there is something seriously wrong with your materials or where you are targeting. Have you tried head hunters?"
58,Smalls doesn’t take reservations. I suggest looking at their website. All relevant information is posted there.
59,Saggio on 181st Street is uptown's best Italian.
60,I really like their menu!  This is definitely on my list at the moment.
61,is there any specific sort of writing that you're looking for? i've spent the last few years working as a creative nonfiction writer and i've been looking to do more with that.
62,"i spent the last two years working with a temp agency and it was a so-so experience. the temp agency knew that i was well qualified and so did the supervisors where i was placed to work, but i was still working low level jobs where i was very overqualified. 

i'm sure everyone has a different experience with temp agencies, but trying to find a temp assignment that pays more than $20 is very difficult, or at least it was for me. even when i was making more than minimum wage, it was usually for a very short amount of time. 

i'd say you should only try to find work with temp agencies if they have a high rating and if you only want to work with them for a short amount of time. it's very easy to fall into being a perpetual temp worker and it's hard to climb out of it. 

also, if you do end up working with a temp agency, try to be in as much control as possible as you can. from my own experience, temp agencies want you to constantly be on assignment and they usually care more about their own needs versus the needs of the temp worker."
63,Broadway bagel around there is also very good
64,"I became a super when I was 22. Old warehouse building in Williamsburg off the Bedford L. 

Just happened to meet and work for the landlord on unrelated projects. Worked hard, earned his trust and was reliable. When the old super was leaving, I applied and somehow talked my way into it.

Pay was super low, like &gt;$500/month, but I had a free apartment. Learned how to do degrees of locksmithing, plumbing, painting, carpentry, and some electric work. Was on call 24/7, but managed to get side gigs for extra cash.

The worst part was flooding in the basement due to heavy rain or melting snow. Also dealing with shady-ass contractors; def learned the hard way how crooked some of them are."
65,brokers' street easy profiles are reliable and hard to fake. if the person has done a lot of transactions and is currently representing property on street easy they can be trusted to a fairly high degree. it sounds legit.
66,Thanks!
67,"I am not a Super, but I’m training to be one - I’m a porter in a 32BJ union job and there is a training program with a curriculum for Super/Resident management. Classes are free, provided you’re in a 32BJ union job. There are prerequisite classes (carpentry, basic plumbing/electric) and electives (locksmithing?erm I forget), but they all offer a lot of help - I think they’re are 2 years worth of 11 week programs in the the curriculum.

My suggestion? If you’re looking for training from the ground up, find a doorman/porter etc. service job within that union, and utilize the free courses. None of it will negatively impact your resume in the long run."
68,gotcha. I guess every building needs a porter as well as a super
69,The Museum of the City of New York and the Brooklyn Museum are also pay as you wish.
70,"Well for starters 40x in salary is pretax whereas 50x in cash is post tax. Assuming a 30% tax, 40x is more like 40*0.7 = 28x."
71,"While I highly recommend smalls, there are plenty of great ""uptown style"" jazz clubs to choose from including the blue note and byrdland. Or you can go to spots like the jazz standard and the village vanguard and plenty more that feel a little less... pretentious. All of its good friend! Check out the websites and know that it will be a good albeit likely expensive night wherever you go."
72,"I didn’t need to recently, but I had NY ID if asked."
73,"Make a list of everyone you know and start scheduling meetups for coffee/lunch and just tell them you are in the market trying to get a job and ask if they have any suggestions and then email you their resume to look over. Don’t directly ask for a job, just ask what they would be doing and make sure to give them your resume."
74,"Twitter, but the engineering community is weird like that."
75,Right?  So it isn't just me.  My father used to bring them home all the time as a young kid.  I remember seeing them around all the time.
76,"Masters student, I Work full time and go to classes twice weekly from 6-8:30."
77,Dr Farah Alani - 369 Lexington Avenue.
78,Casually in greece we leave a small tip. Something like 10% of the order.
79,I have and they aren't particularly helpful with NYC gigs.
80,i forgot how much i love these. former gulf coast rep
81,"Buy my staple foods at the cheaper grocery stores like Key Food since their produce section is usually bad quality (rice, pasta, beans/lentils, etc).  Fruit from the produce stands on the corner.  Only go to the nicer grocery stores for fresh veggies and meat.

Cook my own loaf of bread once a week to have delicious toast for breakfast every day.  Pack a lunch and only eat out occasionally.  Clothes come from thrift stores."
82,That's what's so important to me. The vibe.
