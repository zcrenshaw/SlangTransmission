0,"Gentrification is a much larger and more complex process than just one (or even one-hundred) moving into an area.

If one person like you (or 100) move into the area, the effect is probably minimal; however, imagine if thousands of people with higher level incomes than more traditional residents move in. More than likely, these people are not going to frequent local businesses: they may order household goods from Amazon instead of frequenting the local bodega/super mart, they may buy craft beer instead of buying the cheap stuff at the local liquor store, or may travel a few miles to (or order Seamless from) a hip new restaurant instead of eating at the local Chinese place. Suddenly these local businesses are not making enough money and shut down.

Now, when these businesses shut down, the Starbucks and hip cafes and Whole Foods come in because they see a demographic they can cater to. These businesses cause rent to rise and suddenly more traditional residents can no longer afford the area and are forced out. Even worse, sometimes elderly people or minority families who have been there forever get priced out only to have the building torn down by some development mogul. Next thing you know, they're building luxury high-rise condominiums that only the wealthiest professional can afford.

Young professionals (like you) probably can't afford the area anymore either and may move somewhere close by but cheaper. Think of someone who can't afford Williamsburg, so they move to Bushwick, or someone who can't afford Fort Greene, so they move to Crown Heights. This is a form of urban sprawl and the process expands. Rinse and repeat.

Look at central Williamsburg around Bedford Ave. It's nearly all white and lots of young professionals or wealthy kids living off their parents' dime. Also, there are lots of tourists around there, which of course bring tons of money and are not usually looking to shop at bodegas or hole-in-the-wall food spots. The stores in the area are mostly boutiques, trendy restaurants/cafes/bars, and Whole Foods/Duane Reade/etc. There's even an Apple Store, Doc Marten’s, and, most recently, a Sephora opened.

If you travel about ten blocks in any direction you will find more Hispanic neighborhoods or Hasidic areas, but they no longer exist in the most centralized parts of Williamsburg. The neighborhood looks very differently than it did 20 years ago and in another 20 years, it will look even different.

So, yes, in a way, you are contributing to gentrification. More so, if you are white moving into a non-white area, you will likely be seen as a symbolic gentrifier, regardless of how much you make or what you choose to support. However, YOU are not gentrification. Live where you have to live and where you can afford to live. If you are worried about the process, I think the best one can do is support local businesses and be pleasant to local residents, maybe volunteer your time in a way that will improve the community if you see fit.

tl;dr: This process is well under way in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bushwick and Bed-Stuy and no one person will stop it.

Edit: added some stuff"
1,"Is he on the lease?  If so, you’ll just have to learn to take turns with the bathroom. "
2,It's 100% illegal for an apartment building not to have trash pick up.
3,I’d just park there as often as possible and see every confrontation through to its climax. The fuck they gonna do to your car? Get a motion activated dash cam and start being a thorn in their side. I’d die on that hill.
4,"Doesn't matter what it is. It could be a renovated treehouse within an artisan outhouse. Yes, you should call 311."
5,"Responding to your update, I’d strongly suggest you consult a lawyer about this, like you said, you paid for a realtor to avoid this shit, there’s gotta be some recourse for this."
6,pio pio is awesome and fits your budget 
7,I live on the 4th floor with no elevator. I do 20%. 
8,"As someone who does deliver Chinese food, this thread brings me false hope. Even if you commented saying you tip 15% or better, genuinely think, do you? My pay breaks down to $2 every order which is about 4-5 an hour. That’s $10 when we are busy. However my shift is 4-10pm (realistically 11pm). We are only busy from 7pm onwards with about 4 deliveries within that first 3 hours. Add in the cost of gas, I’ll gross about $60-$80 a night and then take a third to half a tank of gas. That’s about $10-$15. So I’m netting $45 (shit night) to $70 (good night). Across 6-7 hours, I’m making $10 an hour. 
I’m not going to convince you or even try to change how you tip. I just want you to have a baseline of what we get paid. "
9,"If the guy is schlepping $60 worth of Chinese food to your door, that's not only additional weight but also additional space he doesn't have for more deliveries. 

I'd suggest tipping the full 20% if it's more than $5. "
10,"Jesus I cant believe some of you spend $400-$1000 on tips every year just for your building!

I need to get a better job or something cause that amount is just ridiculous to me."
11,"Sounds like he's just as skeptical as you are. If I'm buying furniture off Craigslist, I would want to know why the person is selling it, too. I would want to make sure it's not because there is something fundamentally wrong with it like having bedbugs. You ignored the question the first time he asked so it seems like you're trying to hide the fact that there is something wrong. The second time he asked, you just answered ""I'm moving"" which just seems really dismissive and further raises skepticism. The fact that he said, ""Can I ask"" before ""where you're moving to?"" indicates that he knows it's a personal question. It's not really about *where* you're actually moving but wanting to make sure what you are saying is not a lie/scam. If you had responded something like ""Oh I've had this for X years and it's in completely fine condition, but I'm moving to another state at the end of this month so I need to get rid of it soon."" then I doubt he would have asked further."
12,"In my experience from kids I grew up with and from tenants/former tenants/tenants' friends who come up to the office, they go to the Poconos, Florida, upstate NY (Troy, NY and Newburgh), and for some reason there's a weird pipeline of people from NY to North Carolina.  "
13,"Hotel lobby bars are a good bet.  The [Bowery](https://www.theboweryhotel.com/dining/bowery-lobby/), [Ludlow](http://ludlowhotel.com/drink/), and [Jane](https://www.thejanenyc.com/events/) Hotels all have cool lounges with fireplaces."
14,Milk bar is extremely overrated now that everything is baked at their central kitchen.  
15,They move to Jersey or Florida 
16,"Totally agree here. The realtor is obligated to disclose that it’s not classed/zoned for residential. Either they didn’t know, and it’s negligent, or they hid that fact, and it’s malicious.

Lawyer up."

18,"\&gt; I think the best one can do is support local businesses and be pleasant to local residents, maybe volunteer your time if you see fit.   


and stop calling the fucking cops on minorities"
19,"I spent Christmas Eve in the drunk tank once. A old man said to me, ""Won't see another one."""
20,"Yikes! Does it matter if its a renovated warehouse with apartments (I think there's 10 or so)?

Should I call 311?"
21,"&gt; Or shall I just fly back to the UK every time I need help where it's free and they genuinely want to help you (since money is not an incentive as the NHS is not private)?

Yes, count your blessings."
22,"Interesting.  

As to the realtor, my guess is you could sue in small claims court to get the fee back.  The theory is that the broker breached their agreement with you by placing you in unlawful, uninhabitable space.  

As to the landlord, I don’t know what would happen if you just stopped paying rent.  I mean, he could sue to evict you, but then he’s exposing himself.  Probably best for the landlord to pay you to leave - you could threaten to report him unless he refunds your entire rent.  I’ve done that, with success, in a similar situation.

As to the cost of moving, same thing.  They both are responsible."
23,"This is kind of a tricky question. But the short answer is yes. If you are from elsewhere, have arrived and are contributing directly to rising cost of living, then yes you are. It’s important however to distinguish that someone of ANY race can be a gentrifier, and that the domain of gentrifier does not belong exclusively to any 1 group. POCs, members of the LGBTQ community, artists colonies, and even poor humanities majors are all part of this. 

Here’s there other thing.:This is capitalism. You can’t fight this on a personal level. neighborhood values are going to wax and wane, hell, once the sea leave rises, Manhattan as a whole may plunge in value. Basically, don’t feel bad about making more money than your neighbors. 

Here’s what you can do though: be a cool neighbor. One of the most glaring issues with gentrification I’ve encountered had to do with Marcus Garvey park in Harlem. There were drum circles which met in Marcus Garvey, and had been doing so for 50+ years. This was a multi-generational phenomenon. A luxury condo was built next to the park a couple years back, and you can guess the rest. Lots of police phone calls later the drum circles were forced out. What really got me about this story was an interviewer with a Long time attendee who said something to the effect of “I’ve been bringing my kids here, and now they bring their kids here. This is where my family learned how to play drums in a communal setting, and now we have to stop because of some Johnny come latelys?”to paraphrase. Anyhow, don’t be like the people in the luxury condo. 

TL;DR it’s more important that you’re a cool about the neighborhoods existing customs and treat others with respect than it is to worry about whether you fall under the blanket term of gentrifier."
24,"Also, I'm pretty sure it's illegal to dispose of personal (like, home) garbage in the public bins. So careful about getting fined for that."
25,wow. you just threw out a free meal.
26,"Either the barriers belong to the NYPD in which case they will pick them up or the building bought some.  In any case, this violates the provision of the Traffic Regulations called ""unofficial reserving of parking spaces.""

Look up your precinct at nyc.gov/nypd and speak to the Neighborhood Coordination Officers for this sector.  This is squarely within their bailiwick."
27,"For Slavic fare I recommend Veselka. Has sit-down and is not very expensive, and the food is superb."
28,"I usually give in the $3-$5 range depending on how large my order is, the weather outside, if it's a holiday, etc. I go higher if it's not a nice day out or it's a holiday. "
29,"This damn tipping culture here is ridiculous. Other countries do it via tipping in exceptional circumstances, not for services required. It leads to ambiguities like what OP posted and all the following comments show.

What should be done is these people should be paid a fair wage in the beginning. Tipping should be a rare occurrence for truly exceptional service. Not to mention almost all tips done with cash, which means tax evasion is rampant.

I still tip of course, and always 20% to 25% (whichever is easier to calculate), but seeing as how it's done in other countries, I am extremely disappointing. Why the heck should I tip someone when they are doing exactly what their job is?

Some places have the audacity to charge a delivery fee on top of needing to tip the delivery guy, which to me seems like just cash grabbing. Or how Uber used to be awesome and just not do tips, but now that changed and I end up tipping 20% because I have no clue if the guy is getting paid properly or not beyond tips.

Regarding delivery people having to take food to you and it being a lot of work, of course it's a lot of work. There are many jobs out there that are a lot of work but you don't tip them. Do you tip your garbage truck people? What about your doctor, or dentist? What about your ambulance people (who get paid atrociously)? Why are some service jobs different than others regarding tips?"
30,"Rat or mouse?  Is it brown and around 3 to 4 inches?   If so, then it’s a field mouse.  Those come in during cold snaps and are frequent visitors of nyc apartments.   Options:   1) Duane reade for mouse traps. 2) borrow a cat.  3) trap and release.  

Rat?  Larger and not brown.    1) trap.  2) beat it silly and remove. 3) call a friend to beat it or trap and remove.  

I’ve had dozens of small brown mice during my 20 years in the city.  Usually during the first cold snaps of a season.

32,"New York, New York by Frank Sinatra. No song says it better. "
33,"I think you’re more likely to hear Italian American accents in NJ or Long Island. 

Interesting read— http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-capicola-became-gabagool-the-italian-new-jersey-accent-explained.amp"
34,Get Advion and caulk across all the cracks with it every two months. That's the #1 thing you can do. Also do under the sink! It's dark and damp there. Bathroom and kitchen. 
35,You can report this to 311 and the traffic department of the cops but I guarantee they will do nothing about it. Welcome to New York! 
36,I’ve heard friends complain about this more as the weather gets worse and more people order instead of going out. 
37,Sounds like illegal housing.
38,"Go to Peter Lugers for their lunch menu which is the only time they have their burgers available. About $15 each. Their burgers are my favorite in the city and they use the trimmings from their steak to make them so you get the aged flavor.

Cafe China. Michelin starred restaurant with weekday lunch specials under $15.

"
39,"&gt;and stop calling the fucking cops on minorities

Or think carefully before calling. Someone's overdosing, having a mental health crisis or being beaten? Call.

Someone's ""loitering"" or has their hood pulled up over their head? Leave them be."
40,I always tip at least 20%. NYC is expensive and the delivery drivers (almost always) deserve it :) 
41,I understand your grief. The delivery man probably thought the elevator didn’t work or exist or maybe he was just plain lazy. But in my experience just cuz it says deliver to your door doesn’t mean all the way to your apartment door. Especially if you don’t leave the apartment number in the instructions. I always follow the directions. The other day I had to walk up 19 flights of stairs to drop off a McDonald’s order because the elevator was broken. The customer didn’t even tip or anything. I didn’t get mad but sometimes the customer is very inconsiderate.
42,"Park there again, remove the barrier. Do what you can to start the confrontation again. If he says “watch out what’s going to happen to your car” I’d say “what do you mean”. Do all this while you are recording; start it before the confrontation and keep it hidden at first. Once it’s started get his face in the video. 

If he follows through on his threat to vandalize your car, take pictures. Highly recommend getting a dash cam in your car that can run on batteries while it’s parked. They’re not too expensive, and it’s useful in general if you get into an accident that’s not your fault. Send all evidence to NYPD. They might not care at first. 

But also post it to social media, NYC subreddits, and 100% send it to the local news stations. Not only will I personally give you karma, but I’ll post it on my Facebook. Post it on twitter especially. Also mention @NYPDnews @PlacardAbuse @Fox5ny @ABC7NY @nypost @Nydailynews in the tweet. Fox-5 news and ABC-7 Eye Witness news love stories like this. It would likely go semi-viral, especially if the Post and Daily News pick up on it. Then file a claim with your insurance company if you have vanadalism coverage, and give them this evidence, and any news coverage, and they might sue him for damages. If not, take it to small claims court yourself, you have a solid case. Maybe even judge Judy! Lol

He’ll have his 15 minutes of infamy, and people will move on. But I won’t. This story pisses me off. I’m like George Costanza, I take parking very seriously. I don’t forget things like this. Most people completely forgot/stopped caring about United Airlines beating up and dragging that man off a plane in April 2017, but I haven’t. Still never flying United again. I’ll do whatever I can to make things hard for this asshole. If I found out where he lives, I’d love to pee on his lawn or something. Maybe spit on him if I get the chance. "
43,"For even more fun, get the biggest, ugliest hooptie you can find - every body panel a different color, exposed rust, loud belt noises when started, barely able to pass inspection, etc. - and park it there as often as possible."
44,"&gt;There’s something both a little silly and a little wonderful about someone who doesn’t even speak the language putting on an antiquated accent for a dead sub-language to order some cheese.

That's basically my childhood in a sentence. I actually laughed out loud. "
45,"Uber eats people won’t even come to front door.   They stand halfway in the yard and hold the food.  
Often have a stand off because I’m shoeless and if I leave the door will lock me out.  
I mean, the inflated prices + delivery fees one would think they could come the few extra steps to the door.   
"
46,"I give $100 to my main 4 doormen &amp; the super.
I give $60 to everyone else (doormen I don’t see often, porters, etc).

I’m in a big building with lots of staff I don’t even know but my building hands out a holiday card with 15 or 20 people on it so those are the only ones I tip. 

I tip them individually only to make sure nothing gets lost along the way or diluted/shared"
47,"First of all, I am so sorry. I've heard great things about The Neighborhood Vet and i know she does house calls. "
48,Have you been under a rock?
49,I work in midtown but live in Jersey.  Don't do what I do..
50,Thanks for your response. That makes a lot of sense 
51,Personal trash in public corner cans is illegal dumping. 
52,"[If the apartment is illegal housing, the landlord is not allowed to collect rent. If they take you to court for failure to pay, it is dismissed, unless you knowingly moved into an illegal apartment or you caused caused it to become an illegal apartment (neither  of which seem to apply to this situation)](https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/illegalapartment.pdf)

Now, of course, they can do other  things to make your life hell. I'd imagine that is not a game most landlords would like to play, especially if you're familiar with your rights and not afraid to get a lawyer.

Personally, I would talk to others in the building. This is not applicable to your situation, but the tenants  in the warehouse I live organized, got a lawyer, and are now covered under the [loft law](http://www.nyc.gov/html/loft/html/laws/loft-law.shtml). Sharing the lawyer fees helped tremendously."
53,"Typically, people pushed out by gentrification move further out from central locations, specifically to places with worse access to public transit. They force folks with even lower income out and we end up with more homeless or people living in unsafely stuffed apartments in neighborhoods more dangerous than the ones they were in before.  "
54,It would be nice if people were just paid a living wage and the ridiculous practice of tipping would go away already.
55,"Other countries also pay their staff a real wage.

I agree, the tipping culture for things like deliveries is a bit absurd. But you would pay the same total amount if employers paid a fair wage and just rolled the current tip into the cost of food."
