0,Transfer to the 8th Ave lines at Times Square. Fuck that walk and tunnel. 
1,"I won't wait on line for whatever the latest fad is, or wait 2 hours to get a table at a restaurant. The city has more restaurants than i could visit in a many years and i'm gonna stand around like a schmuck to get into one? "
2,"Nobody's gonna comment on where OP thinks fruit comes from??

"
3,Was it Tropic of Cancer?
4,"Manhattan is the city, Queens is Queens, Brooklyn is Brooklyn, the Bronx is the Bronx, and Staten Island is unspeakable. "
5,"My understanding is if you live within the 5 boroughs, usually Manhattan is referred to as the city. If you live outside of the 5 boroughs, “the city” may take on to encompass all 5 boroughs themselves. "
6,"I will not sit down on benches/chairs on subway platforms. First, they are a breeding ground for bedbugs. Second, I once witnessed a homeless dude straddling the armrests and taking a monster dump on the seat of one of those wooden benches. I haven't sat down in a subway station in over a decade. "
7,If I'm coming from a party late night I won't take a cab back home if I can just take the subway. Some of my friends scowl but I'm not in a rush to go home. I don't want to spend $20 - $50 for something that will get me home only 15 minutes earlier. 
8,"Welcome to being a woman,  except many women don't yell back, as that could get them killed.  



You were assaulted.  Police/911. But being midtown, you cant piss and not hit a cop, so find one and point out the guy who assaulted you. "
9,"[According to a NYPL librarian](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/15irzr/does_anyone_know_the_maximum_fine_for_overdue/) the max is $14 if you return the book. Otherwise, they charge you for the cost of the book."
10,"&gt; I once witnessed a homeless dude straddling the armrests and taking a monster dump on the seat of one of those wooden benches.  
  
From a product design perspective, it is always amazing to see the innovation with which the end user utilizes the product's features in ways unexpected by the designer"
11,Wow that’s hilarious. Imagine stressing about potentially owing millions of dollars just to find out its $14. 
12,"The way it’s supposed to work is that the landlord lowers his prices until a tenant is found. This is the “free market”.

However, most of these properties are owned by an oligopoly of holding companies who would rather hold the lines on the high rents and ruin the neighborhood than risk an actual market correction.

No doubt huge swathes of these properties are actually convoluted financial instruments/stores of wealth in a wider portfolio, which turns the lack of rental income into some sort of tax write off or offsets the gains elsewhere.

Just another symptom of this country’s totally dysfunctional  and utterly corrupt economy and a lovely physical reminder of the total anemia of the American left for the last half century."
13,"I don't order food by saying ""lehmme gettta"""
14,I think you're making the incorrect assumption that the MTA is a modern and well run organization.
15,"Thanks for walking faster. Come back, spend some more money and walk even faster next time. "
16,"Both is fine. 

Depends on who the conversation is with too. If the person isn't from New York, it might be wiser to say Manhattan. Locally in Brooklyn ""the city"" is widely accepted."
17,I feel like late at night is the only time it makes sense to take a cab. Any other time you're going to be in traffic for long than you'd be on the subway. And I'd rather die than swipe my metrocard to find out the next train is in 18 minutes and its already 2am or something. Late night cabs all the way
18,"People seem to forget fruit grows outside exposed to the elements, was picked by sweaty workers in the hot sun, stored somewhere that was not sterile, and then likely transported on a truck. "
19,"I'll try to take the Subway, but the few times I've been too tired/smashed, I pass out and wake up in Coney Island."
20,i will not eat somewhere with a B rating...dont @ me
21,Did this and woke up on Kings Highway one time and Forest Hills another. It was 7 am when i woke up at forest hills which means i was on the train for \~4 hours. imagine how many trips i did...
22,"As a young woman, I feel like I can't really afford to do that if I'm alone :( "
23,That tunnel always seems eternal. The depressing poem on the rafters about how we're all just living groundhog day probably doesn't help either! 
24,Pretend Williamsburg/Bushwick is anything other than a well branded shithole.
25,"Thank you.  I was thinking I should have found a cop but then I was like, I'm a younger bearded brown guy who had had some drinks, he's an old white guy, this could flip on me quickly.  If there were an officer right there I think I would have reported it.  But I lost my nerve."
26,"NYPL late fee is 25 cents per day. If he checked out this book on August 16, 1970 and returned it today he would owe $4,383. 

Edit: SORRY I HAD TO DO IT it was just too tempting. also I didn’t know there was a max fine so this is hypothetical of course
"
27,"Because I don't want to pass out drunk and wake up in Coney Island.. again. Nor do I want to have to sit on the platform for 13 minutes, plus I don't feel like walking from the subway, plus just get me the heck home now, please."
28,I walk almost 2 miles home from work and that tunnel somehow ends up feeling like a longer walk than my commute.
29,"&gt;well I don't plan to eat my lungs

do it you coward"
30,"Refuse to take cabs as much as I can. 

Incredibly over-priced for the distance you go, cab drivers don't know where they're going/refusing to go to certain areas/illegally changing the meter/being rude/dirty cars.

I could go on but I honestly have less  issues with Uber being in the city despite their scumminess because it's absolutely a better experience overall and if you're not in an extreme hurry and there's not surge pricing, I see zero reason to take a cab."
31,Order delivery. I can't afford to be payin for that when I can just pick it up from the store.
32,"isn't it actually very traditionally NYC for manhattanites to not go to brooklyn? like that was a whole episode in sex and the city, when miranda was considering moving there"
33,"Yup. So many Manhattanites just WILL NOT cross a body of water to go ANYWHERE. It doesn't matter if they live in Inwood, and it'd be quicker to go to the Bronx than the LES, crossing a body of water turns them into headless horsemen or something... 

Me to friend: But you LIVE on the L! Lorimer is literally 3 stops from your apartment! Why won't you meet me halfway in Williamsburg, but you'll haul ass to Inwood for Jennifer's shit! "
34,"Yes there’s a mental heath crisis team, made up of Mental health professionals. Call 888-NYC Well. 

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/crisis-emergency-services-mobile-crisis-teams.page"
35,Was this near Chelsea Market / in the low 20s? There was a thread not too long ago where it seemed like maybe there was a serial ass-grabber in that neighborhood.
36,More of the same until we implement a vacancy tax.
37,"Absolute Bagels on Broadway and 108. Usually get the Everything with cream cheese, or bacon cheddar cream cheese. Or an everything with BEC pepper and ketchup. "
38,"I don't go to my bagel shop anymore because it takes about 45 minutes to get through the line.

It's a real bummer, honestly."
39,"Because despite NYers insisting it’s “a 24hr system”, it’s not. Entire lines shut down overnight or entire weekends and even if they’re running, it’s a gamble that the train you get on will move faster than walking pace or just switch to a different track for no discernible reason other than “fuck you”."
40,"Fuck no, duck my head and avoid them as much as I can "
41,"Well shit, happy birthday to him. "
42,Buzzfeed did a video on my local one in Queens and now it's super crowded. I hate Buzzfeed.
43,Because they don't know -&gt; Because the signalling system is old -&gt; Because the MTA sucks -&gt; Because NYS governor sucks -&gt; Because the government is generally incompetent and corrupt.
44,"I forgot where on Reddit I saw this quote, “Buzzfeed is the Nickelback of the Internet.”"
45,One of us 
46,"I think the equation (celebrity+feels = highest executive office) is whats wrong with this country and I'm not interested in playing that game.

She can come back when she's held any elected office whatsoever. "
47,Lots of bodegas in the city
48,"i think I have seen failure to provide adequate security as being a violation on the HPD website, you might want to contact them on Monday (all this stuff has to be done via 311).

AFAIK - they can fine the LL till they comply to fix the problem."
49,27  Non-existant. Thanks for bringing it up. 
50,Cold spring is awesome. Lots of antique shops and a great trail in breakneck ridge. Just an hour and 15 minutes (give or take a few) north on the Hudson line.
51,"Buy nothing, accept nothing offered to you by hand, be it a CD, a card, a trinket, nothing ever.  Best practices: don't engage with anyone on the street, that way you insulate yourself from the nonsense.  "
52,I won't wait in line for some stupid croissant-slash-donut thing or whatever the fresh fad of the moment is. I don't care how good it is.
53,"Yes, there are many more. A good number are also fake. Has anyone noticed that in Midtown, at least, they all have the same style cardboard signs? I recently saw a fairly well-dressed woman in Greeley Square churning these signs out one by one, each with a creative sob story."
54,I work in the Empire State Building and there’s tons of fake panhandlers around- one guy has had a sign claiming it’s his birthday for over 6 months now. 
55,Somebody get Mr. Bookman!
56,This is so engrained in me that I have to stop myself from translating it literally when speaking other languages.
57,[deleted]
58,"Dude. It's already hard enough to get a B rating, and if you look at the [inspection results](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) even the A ratings have some nasty violations. I completely understand, and I've had to stop going to a few places when their ratings dropped. "
59,This guy incomes
60,"The Met Council on Housing has a tenants rights hotline. Give them a call. 

http://metcouncilonhousing.org/tenants_rights_telephone_hotline

Edit to add - you should also request a copy of your apartment’s rental history. I stopped by the lower Manhattan office and got it in less than 10 minutes. 

http://www.nyshcr.org/Rent/tenantresources.htm"
61,"CBTC will continue to make issues worse because the MTA seems insistent on maintaining along with it the arcane and ludicrously slow speed limits they’ve been implementing since the single-fatality train-to-train collision in 1995.

Without addressing the optimal speed problem, and continuing to support low speed limits which have been proven to increase delays and overcrowding, problems will only continue to worsen no matter what system is in place.

TL;DR: CBTC only works if you implement it fully, which they’re not. "
62,"Believe it or not, my usual walking speed fit in pretty well around town. I can definitely understand the hate for people stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. Drove me crazy."
63,"It happens.  Dont beat yourself about it.  Realistically, there's probably not much that can be done now, but midtown is absolutely lousy with cameras, so he's probably on tape somewhere. "
