0,"Sort of agree, but I think it's because nyc is about having those random encounters at an interest or hobby group. New Yorkers will open up at a tennis meetup or a dnd campaign or on a hike. But I agree with you that meeting people at bars or events that are only about drinking is much harder here. I think the truth is people aren't as interested unless they have some compelling reason to want to be your friend over the other 100 people outside, whether it's a hobby or a physical attraction or the rare hyper humor compatability.

When I started making friends via hobbies instead of partying it started getting way easier to find people who'd proactively reach out to you, would be less flakey, and you realise that your party friends are mostly acquaintances."
1,It’s spelled clique btw
2,because dads of 12 year olds get out...not the parents of a toddler though.
3,"I'm a toddler's parent, so I don't get to go out much, but that vaguely seems true. People don't go out to a bar to meet new friends; they go out to socialize with their existing ones. (I know I'm like that, too - if I'm at a bar, I'm usually with existing friends, and not looking for new people to join us.)

But I've also run into people who are glad to chat; my wife and I ran into another couple just earlier this week.

I think the trick is finding interest groups, not random bars. Are you into D&amp;D? Sports? Basket-weaving?"
4,Came here to say this. The way to meet people here is through your hobbies/interests/activities. Not at bars.
5,Los Tacos #1
6,"&gt;Random encounters is a big no. It doesn’t seem as if you can just walk up to someone and say “hey how are you? Nice to meet you”

So, a lot of this attitude stems from a self-preservation thing, both out of safety and comfort. The people who do that tend to be selling you something, conning you, or just plain weird, so yeah, you're right that it's not the culture to do this. People will feel more comfortable interacting with you when you've established some type of common ground. ""Hi, nice to meet you"" isn't a great opener at a bar. ""Sorry to interrupt, did I hear Stranger Things? I just finished this season  haven't had anyone to talk to about it with!"" is a good opener, assuming the people you're sitting next to seem like they'd be friendly enough to chat. This is also a LOT easier if you're a regular somewhere. Studies show that seeing a face multiple times makes you much more apt to trust or interact with them in the future.

NYC is also a city of options, whether it's work, housing, or people. Don't expect to start a chat with other regulars at the bar and then become BFFs. Plant that seed at a couple of places, including work or other activities, and see where it goes. Some will blossom into friendships, others might be acquaintances who invite you to a party, and then you meet cool people at the party who will meet up with you at the bar in the future... anyway, you see how this goes.

You're right that most people meet through work or school. Do you have friends at work or from previous school things (or friends-of-friends) you could start to hang out with?"
7,"&gt;toddler's parent

why not just say dad.."
8,"Being a dad of a 18 year old is very different than being a dad of a 12 year old which is also very different than being the dad of a 3 year old. A toddler is like a permanently drunk adult with a seemingly constant desire to kill themselves in the weirdest ways, which means the dad gets very little time to himself."
9,I’ve noticed that too and I’ve lived here all my life. It’s really not like the movies. I got into a community college here n have made only one friend everyone else is from high school. I’ll be your friend tbh
10,"Yeah, we were out because we had a babysitter night. *They* were out because their kid's age is in the double-digits, and gets to spend a few weeks at grandma's house!

My god, do you know what I could do if we had *whole weeks* without a dependent? Imagine, *imagine*, getting eight straight hours of sleep and getting to sleep in as late as I want to on a Saturday."
11,Los tacos #1 or tacos el bronco
12,"Depends where you want to live. In popular parts of Manhattan/Brooklyn, any studios under $1750 are not going to be great. But if you just get one roommate you like you can have a really nice place for even $1500-1600 in a good location."
13,No
14,"Roosvevlt ave in queens, they have real Mexicans in carts selling Corn tortilla tacos like the real ones almost 24/7."
15,Volunteering is a good way to meet people. New York Cares coordinates hundreds of volunteer projects. They have a website.
16,"In my 8 years of living in NYC, I had social groups come and go. Most of the friends I made were through work or shared hobbies/interests. The random friends I met through other people at social gatherings or bars never stuck around.

People from the Tri-State and/or went to school in the area have an advantage, but new friends can be made. It takes work and keep in mind people become busy/disappear fairly often."
17,"$127 x 12 =  $1,524

Wow, that seems like more in writing."

19,People a e welcoming but they aren't going to put the leg work in for you.
20,"While I find that NYC’ers get the wrong reputation and that we are way nicer than people make us out to be, it is true that we can be a little prickly and stand offish. In a city where any one could stab you and pee on your shoes you try not to open up to anybody"
21,"I have a question. So, you are held at gun point on 6 train. But now you have a gun, what are your actions now?
 
Can you reach your gun in less than a second and fire? You are not Raynolds and it’s not some Justified episode."
22,Tacos Bronco in Sunset Park. Worth the trip
23,"Take the 7 train or any train that gets to Roosvevlt ave, walk out street level and go up Roosvevlt not even a block and they’ll be 4 trucks around, all Mexican, all day.                                                                      Edit: Roosvevlt ave station"
24,7 or E to Roosevelt Ave.
25,"What else are you interested in? Any social activities, sports, art, creating stuff? Maybe you find people sharing certain interests by taking part in events connected to these interests? You could always do something voluntary! Have patience, it just takes it's time."
26,I have not seen these cool men you speak of either.
27,"I mean, I go out and just try to say hi to people and they often dismiss me.

Like in Ktown people didn’t really want to interact with people they were with, unless dudes were going after women. 

Brooklyn was chill, but people who talked to me were tourist. 


East villages was ok, but mainly students."
28,seamless? If you don't want delivery go to the closest diner.
29,Tortilleria Nixtamal is closer :(
30,"That place is awesome! I havent been there in a while but the last time I was there, it was a long wait."
31,You can in Queens. I scored a large newly rennovated rent-stabilized 550 sqft studio for $1600 in Sunnyside beginning of the year. I work in midtown and my commute is only 15-20 minutes.
32,Just being honest given my own experience
33,"Lol. Both ways jail time dude. 
See shady people in the train? Change cars or trains."
34,I haven’t been to tacos el bronco but it looks awesome.
35,This looks amazing! Thank you so much!
36,Yes I think there is some truth to that. How long have you lived in NYC? It can take years to establish a social circle
37,I never even check the names I’ve tried all of them and they all are good.
38,"I’ve never been to Tijuana but the best tacos I’ve had in my life were in Mexico City. And the closest here I’ve had were at Tortillería Nixtamal in Corona or Los Hermanos in Bushwick. 

And honestly in Corona/Jackson Heights any taco truck or hole in the wall Mexican restaurant will have delicious tacos. I’ve not had a bad experience yet. Crus-Z Family in Jax Heights was the most recent and also recommended. Enjoy!"
39,"Yes. That’s what’s missing on the streets - a bunch of untrained individuals (yeah, 50 rounds a year doesn’t count) who think they can act under pressure and “defend” themselves. Dude, it isn’t some Rambo movie, life is much more complicated than you think."
40,https://ohny.org/
41,"So lie to the cops to get them to show up over one crazy? Im sure the nyc cops are gunna love you for that one. 

Its also illegal to make false claims to get police attention fyi.

10/10 shit advice."
42,"Oh yeah and there’s also bumble, that one dating app that has a friends section lol if ur into that"
43,Happy cake day :)
44,I usually say sorry and keep walking. Once in a while I get a nasty retort
45,This sounds less like hustling and more like extortion
46,Obao is lovely for a pre-dinner meal.
47,Lmao this doesnt warrant one you took
48,Rcn
49,I know! But live to fight another day!
50,"I hate to say it but just because the judge gave her 2.5 months does not mean she cannot milk it more. She can submit an order to show cause a few more times and then with the new law she can claim she doesn’t have another apartment in the same price point/area so she’ll get another year. Then the warrant can be issued and then even when she vacates she can be let back in with an order to show cause and a sympathetic judge.

It sounds like an exaggeration to people that haven’t dealt with l&amp;t court here but it’s the sad truth."
51,Unfortunately I'm not buddies with De Blasio or the commissioner :/
52,"Dude, the relatively important description of that hotel is the one with the Eiffel Tower on it.  Not any signage; the Eiffel Tower."
53,"Wow didn't know about the Run Center, thanks. Have you taken any of their classes?"
54,5th ave and central park this week.
55,"For anyone wondering, slacks you = messages you, usually on the Slack app."
56,I moved to the city from dc when I was 18 into my first apt. Man the fuck up. : ) I say that with love.
57,"I’m 22 and have felt similarly. I graduated college at 21 and moved here last August for a one year contracted job. I just started working in the government, and all of my coworkers have made comments about how they’re early in their careers, but I’m really REALLY early in my career and it makes me feel strange, like I haven’t earned my place. I’ve met people through volunteering and being friends of their friends, which has given me a decent social circle. Also, weirdly enough, dating apps. Met my boyfriend on one, but also a few good platonic friends. I think a lot of people assume I’m 24-25, and I don’t share my age in the professional environment unless it’s brought up."
58,He’s a rich. The rich can get things we cannot. They don’t want average joes to have guns.
59,Still going to ignore your tip jar.
60,Just accept it's not working ... either way you try to work or mold it :/
61,"Thanks, I’ll try that"
62,"Start with the ones listed

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/8rg2vp/whats_the_most_sociable_bar_in_new_york/"
63,Maybe it has improved.
64,moving at 10pm is kinda rude to your neighbors. Can you delay til the daytime?
65,"It's been gentrifying(debatable if thats an improvement), slowly but surely.  Real Estate has gone insane the last 10 years, and its one of the cheaper areas thats still in Portland proper."
66,this crazy bitch is everywhere being a grammar Nazi
67,Tacombi is just as good.
