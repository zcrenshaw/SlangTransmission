1,"*In the criminal justice system, drinking wine at picnics is considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious infractions are members of an elite squad known as the Picnic Patrol Unit. These are their stories.*

**SHUNG SHUNG**"
2,"Bowery Meat Co, Wolfgang's on 34th and Park, or Quality Meats."
3,I took one once by just going to a floor in my building that my company didn't occupy. Found a nice little open lounge area with seats and just talked in a low and respectful tone so I wouldn't bother anyone around me
4,"You say ‚ÄúI am moving out on X‚Äù and then you do. Everyone in NYC deals with the doubt of not knowing if the next place will be better. Sometimes it‚Äôs not, but that‚Äôs the risk you take if you need out of the situation you‚Äôre in. "
5,Alec Baldwin lives in the village. I‚Äôve seen him walking about a number of times. 
6,Pennsy?
7,"Greenwood Cemetery runs a tour in conjunction with King's County distillery that sounds right up your alleys. 

https://www.green-wood.com/calendar/

&gt;Green-Wood is teaming up with our friends at Kings County Distillery to delve into the storied past of distilling in Brooklyn. The afternoon kicks off with a trolley tour of the cemetery‚Äôs ‚Äúpermanent residents‚Äù with whiskey connections, including the one and only casualty of the Brooklyn Whiskey Wars of the late 1860s and early 1870s. Afterward, the trolley will head to Kings County Distillery in the Brooklyn Navy Yard where visitors will see first-hand how whiskey is made and enjoy a tasting of four delectable varieties."
8,"I haven‚Äôt seen the Pennsy listed.   It is right above penn station and I would avoid before a MSG concert, but I think they have some great restaurants and a they have a nice bar in the middle."
9,i think about them regularly
10,Lots of places stock them year round.  They usually have Irish bangers at Whole Foods.
11,"I don't watch that show, so all I care about is Captain Janeway. Have you seen her?"
12,Yea but poor reception is a possibility 
13,i live in usq and constantly see celebrities. i think probably because they are passing through to go to east/west village or soho area. but yeah i see celebs on a daily basis. also used to see a lot in soho proper when i worked in that area.
14,Iron Chef Marc Forgione's restaurant on Reade Street in TriBeca is excellent.
15,"Ok, Lt. Olivia Benson. "
16,No joke it was the most terrified I have ever been. I sprinted out of there. 
17,"I believe it‚Äôs against park rules, but I‚Äôve done it without any trouble. Just don‚Äôt brandish it, and you might be better off transferring it to a less obvious container. If you‚Äôre discreet the cops have better things to worry about"
18,"Do you have an actual butcher in your neighborhood?  Ask them.  If they don't have it, they could probably get what you're looking for.

21,"&gt;The remaining outstanding amount is around $5000

I'm sorry, but this is too low a number where hiring a lawyer makes any sense.  Remember, no matter what you pay the attorney, you will likely not get back from the landlord and that will reduce the amount you receive.

&gt;Not trying to pay a whole bunch for a full lawsuit or anything, more like a consultation to see if they have advice on if there is anything I should do or if this would not work small claims wise.

Just out of curiosity, how much were you looking to pay?  I'll tell you if I think you're approaching a realistic number."
22,Aurora Soho 
23,Zocdoc is also a great place to look. I have had a great experience using that site to research doctors and book appointments. 
24,"If you live higher up, I would recommend a professional because accidents can happen, especially with people that may not have the experience of lugging a large appliance up to a window and then thinking it's stable. Some buildings mandate that a professional or the super installs it"
25,"My old next door neighbor would do the same thing. We were pretty friendly with them, so whenever he forgot his keys, we would let him in our apartment, he would climb the fire escape from our window, then pull the AC out and climb into his place"
26,Fraunces Tavern in FiDi is great.
27,"Call their 877 number...their phone customer service, not the location. Tell them you‚Äôre thinking of leaving...usually give you a discount. Gym itself won‚Äôt."
28,"Huh? Do you also reply to emails from princes in Nigeria? If you‚Äôre getting scammed it‚Äôs your own fault. Here‚Äôs a tip, if a really hot 19 year old girl starts chatting with you on an app, it‚Äôs a scam. Also you can set your distance preference so not sure why you‚Äôd be matching with people out of state. "
29,whats that?
30,"If I had to guess, I think it‚Äôs the landlord/owner doing it. The four listings I found were all hosted by the same person (not the owner), and the posts shared a few of the same pictures (common spaces, laundry room, etc). "
31,"What the fuck. The last edible I had was half a 10 mg gummy candy and I was numb all over. Granted, it was some medical grade shit and I'm a 115 lb girl/light smoker but I would be catatonic after 1.5 grams."
32,Thanks!!
33,"Oh, yeah, nobody wants to bother anyone.

Thanks!!"
34,"Yeah, i totally get that.

Not looking to harass anyone. Just get glimpses. :)

Its more for my family than me. I dont care haha"
35,Cool. Thanks!
36,Marea is just so so. I would pick the Modern over both of those but Le Bernadine over Marea 
37,"Unless it has been a long time, feel free to PM me any recommendations! Thank you! "
38,"No. You are missing the point. These cards EXIST. Even if 99% of the time they didn't do anything (and they do), there would be no reason for them to EXIST except for to say ""hey, I have a friend/family member that's just like you. Could you take it easy on me?"" And, while some don't, it's an option that shouldn't exist."
39,It‚Äôs not appropriate for this forum. 
40,"&gt;Feel free to ask any of your NYC-related questions here.

The man is saying he grew up in NYC and his identity is unknown. Is that far of a stretch to ask if anyone recognizes him?"
41,"Ok, here's a BBC story. 


Of course it's still at the discretion of the officer, but I think that most just give you a warning if you present it for something like speeding. The fact that they even exist and there is an option to present them is already an abuse of power, in my opinion. "
42,I don‚Äôt think I can handle that..I was on 250mg in the Scientology center 
43,"me: ""YOU GO THE WRONG GUY. I'M TELLING YOU IT WAS *GRAPE JUICE*""

45,Not a chance in hell. 
46,"Butcher Block in Sunnyside seems a good bet, give them a call.  It‚Äôs right off the 40th st stop on the 7."
47,"You are welcome! Also agreed with the other poster about the museum of sex. It‚Äôs an overpriced sex museum lol. However the gift shop is free to enter inside and they have a bunch of neat toys lol üòÖ. 

If I think of anything else to add I‚Äôll just edit this comment but Brooklyn bridge is also cool but super crowded nowadays... If you watched Ghostbusters, the library scene is at the fifth ave branch with the marble lions. If you are into Taiyaki, they opened up a shop down in Chinatown. "
48,I walked through times square on christmas eve after eating 6 packages of 250mg gummies.  This was either before or after I went into one of those super christmasy christmas stores full of christmas.
49,"You run the chance of encountering some drunk douchebags hitting on you, or possibly a rather aggressive homeless person, but that's about it."
50,"Usually, a quiet upstairs corner of a megadeli, like Cafe R. People are usually in and out and don't usually go upstairs. If Gyro II on 7th Ave near penn station is still there, they have a quiet upstairs as well."
51,"Sleep No More. If you are a fan of creepy, then this will 100% be the highlight of your trip. Get back to me and tell me I‚Äôm wrong after you‚Äôve experienced it. Google ‚ÄòMcKittrick Hotel‚Äô. You will love it and you‚Äôll get a couple of creepy souvenirs too. "
52,...and it was who?
53,"Excuse me, I think you'll find the PPU gavel sound is **DUN DUN**.

Enjoy your temp ban, wine-drinking scum (just in case, obviously /s)."
54,This has been known to happen. Those with weekly/monthlies often get locked out for 18 minutes because of these phantom swipes. 
55,I like how the makeup girl thanks god at the end
56,I‚Äôve used them. I recommend Xoom. 
57,Is the High Line any good in early March? Or should one wait until later in spring/summer? thanks
58,"Very true, I didn't think of that. Where do you recommend?"
59,Thanks - what WOULD you recommend?
60,"This is a situation where I‚Äôd recommend a good broker. Your budget is good and they should be able to help. 

However, the two bathroom requirement is probably going to have to go. "
61,"I don‚Äôt really care personally, we‚Äôre kind of out of the way of the more touristy parts of the city so there‚Äôs not a lot of guests it seems like. The less amount of full time tenants also means I get access to the shared washer and dryer basically any time I want.

But the other part of me knows all too well about the negative effects Airbnb can have on a housing market (I moved from New Orleans where it‚Äôs a big problem). It‚Äôs also not just one apartment, it‚Äôs basically two floors of a five story building‚Äîa big chunk that could go to local residents. "
62,"You‚Äôre better off going to a CUNY, Pace, Baruch, St. Francis, Hunter etc. MMC has no value if you get a degree outside of the arts. It‚Äôs appealing bc it‚Äôs cheap and the people are nice, I applied there also. But it‚Äôs so not worth the time or money. Also! There‚Äôs nothing fun in that neighborhood to do so if you live on campus I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs boring. "
63,Is that what they‚Äôre calling it? That‚Äôs such a terrible name.
64,"You can easily get a 2 bed, 2 bath in Astoria with that kind of budget."
65,"Things can be both invented in America and ""artisan."""
66,Lol absolutely. I'm sorry you are right. I had a few jumbled ideas there. 
67,"I came across this guy in YouTube. He has great advice and tons of helpful videos. Hope it helps! https://youtu.be/DH6RMPgLpXs . I‚Äôm also a bartender and I find his advice quite sound. Before my first bartending gig, i started out as a server and told my managers that I was interested in bartending. When the position opened they put me on. Having that first gig enabled me to get other bartending jobs as I moved around and continued to build my history. Get a good knowledge base, apply the f out f places, be willing to start out in their positions, and follow up with leads. Good luck!"
68,"Recently I put money on my metro card and once I swipe it show me the ‚Äúinsufficient funds‚Äù message. There was no one working on the station  so I put more money and it did not work.  Obviously I jump and catch the train, but once I check my bank account it did charge me twice. I follow o complain, but they mail me a letter that basically said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs was no problem on our end contact your bank‚Äù "
