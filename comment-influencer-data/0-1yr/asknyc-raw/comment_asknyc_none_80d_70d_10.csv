0,Your landlord is full of shit.
1,"1) A bodega is a corner store/deli/source of probably everything you need. You stand at the counter and order, then pay at the cashier. Respect the cat.

2) learn how to swipe your MetroCard correctly on subways AND buses, and if you are on the bus,  shout BACK DOOR if you're at your stop but the driver didn't hit open.

3) move in on the subway. Step into the middle.

4)  move to the right on escalators or walk up on the left side. 

5) Fold your pizza."
2,"Do not stare. No matter what crazy shit happens on the subway, resist all urge to stare. When I first moved here, I was amazed by how unfazed New Yorkers are by everything. Soon, I learned that staring at a person (whether it's a crazy person talking to themselves, a couple fighting, a woman screaming into her phone, etc.) is a great way to get drawn in or attract unwanted attention. Eyes down. 

The Brooklyn Queens Expressway is the ""bee que ee"" and Houston Street is pronounced ""house-ton"" (not like the city in Texas). 

People will say slick shit to you even when you're not doing anything wrong, so just let it go. Some people are really miserable. 

In general, do not give money to beggars on the subway. If you are really moved by them you can given them food/water, but it's best to volunteer at a shelter if you really want to help."
3,"Efficiency does not equal rudeness. You should not be making small talk with the guy at the bagel counter when there are other people on line behind you. 


To your original point, definitely don't say ""Big Apple""."
4,"Fans, cold showers, cold foods (frozen grapes are the best), high quality deodorant, spending time in air-conditioned places that cost little or no money (museums, libraries, grocery store, etc), etc.

At night, I've occasionally slept on the roof. When that isn't possible I soak a t-shirt in water, ring it out so it's just damp, then wear that to bed and sleep in front of a really good fan.

When even that isn't enough, I get a couple large sturdy plastic ice bricks, freeze them solid, drop them into a pillowcase, then sleep on them. Don't use the cheap flexible kind, they pop too easily and then you get silica gel everywhere.

In the hottest months I keep six ice bricks in the freezer. I'll take three when I go to bed, then when I inevitably wake up at 3 AM because they've melted I switch them out for the other three."
5,"When you see someone famous in public , under no circumstances should you approach them..."
6,"Occasionally I get annoyed by people slow-walking while using their phones up or down the subway steps with a dozen people behind them.

Also, having lived in Tokyo, the lack of queues to get on the subway -- everyone passive aggressively inching closer to the edge in front of each other while waiting feels unnecessarily competitive and inefficient.

Oh, and broker fees and ""net effective"" rent nonsense. Never had that in any other city."
7,holy shit is this real
8,If a person asks you how much you pay in rent/paid for the apartment its generally not considered to be  rude.
9,"Downloading a bunch of podcasts and just walking around, people watching, window shopping."
10,At that point is it even worth it to not have an AC? Going out of your way to the 10th degree to avoid an extra $30 a month electricity bill.
11,"Referring to subway lines by color (eg, the blue line) isn’t the usual thing here. Refer to them by their letters (the ACE) or the avenue they run down (the eighth avenue line)."
12,"&gt; If you are really moved by them you can give them food/water, but it's best to volunteer at a shelter if you really want to help.

A friend of mine is a gardener, so sometimes he's really dirty and sweaty on his way home. He said it's rare,  but occasionally people will come up and give him a snack bar because they think he's homeless. 

I asked if he took them and he was like ""free snack bar"""
13,"People who argue that the city should remain shitty because it's always been shitty. Defending people who walk/ride around blaring terrible music, for example. Being a piece of shit is not somebody's culture, and nothing of cultural value will be lost if they are made to stop.

Also, people who don't understand how to use public spaces. Stay to the right when walking, biking, and driving. Don't block the entrance to the train. Don't try to get on until people have gotten off. It's not complicated."
14,Don’t trust bodegas WITHOUT a bodega cat
15,And don’t forget to take off your backpack on a crowded subway.
16,As a new Yorker I stare at shit all the time because fuck you do something
17,"When giving an intersection for numbered streets, street comes before avenue. For example, 86th and 3rd is on the UES but 3rd and 86th doesn’t exist :)"
18,"IDNYC gets you a 1yr membership to a ton of cultural institutions, including most of the major museums and zoos. Also, you can get free ferry rides to Governors Island."
19,"If you wear a MAGA hat in public, you will get dirty looks, and you will deserve those dirty looks -- it's the functional equivalent of wearing a red armband."
20,"&gt;Your landlord is full of shit.

yes, this.  couldn't have said it any better"
21,41st between 8th and 9th is pretty bad. But my choice is all of Chinatown. The air just doesn’t move.
22,"Unless you're at the farmer's market...

""I'll get a quart of cider, two donuts, and... woah! that's a big apple!"""
23,"Peter Dinklage almost hit me on his electric scooter when I was trying to jaywalk, so that's on me.  

Ilana Glazer likes my dog, though!"
24,I feel like this is an advanced level New Yorker attitude.
25,A cat that lives in a bodega and kills the mice and insects.
26,"NYIC's toolkit says this about witnessing an immigration arrest or raid: 

 * Document the interaction: You have the right to photograph and record the interaction. Do so from a safe distance so that you do not escalate the arrest or raid.

 * Write down: how many officers there were, what their badge numbers were (if you can see), what they were wearing and what their uniforms or vests said, what type of car they were driving (with license plate).

 * Report what you saw: Immediately report what you saw! If you live in New York City, call the Immigrant Defense Project: 212-725-6422. If you live outside of New York City, call United We Dream 1-844-363-1423."
27,Poverty is expensive.
28,"There's a lot of overlap in colors
https://www.varchev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/companies_large-618x348.gif"
29,"To add to this, make sure you send them a certified letter informing them of where to send your security deposit because they will surely try to deduct from it. If they do deduct from your security deposit and they don’t provide you with a written line item of the deductions, or they list the three days as a line item, you can sue them for additional damages. It’s very easy to do in small claims without a lawyer."
30,"Yes, absolutely do not ever mention subway line colors.  I'd mug you"
31,I'd have to agree with OP. I work near Herald Square and it is vile. I saw someone jacking off to porn on a LinkNYC at 6th and 34th and have not been able to get that out of my scarred mind. 35th &amp; 7th Ave. is pretty disgusting too and always smells like pee and it's normal to see human feces there. That general area is the worst in my opinion.
32,"Funny New York story......

I was in the florist one morning and across the street was a big Gristedes supermarket...

I’m looking out the window as my order is being prepared and who do I see walking into Gristedes.... Barbara Streisand....

The young clerk in the shop says to me , he is going to get her autograph because his mom is a big fan...

I told him that’s not cool... but he said he had to take the chance....

I watched him cross the street enter Gristedes and come back 5 minutes later with his head hanging down...

I asked him what happened and he said...

I walked up to Ms Streisand and very politely asked her for a autograph for my mother...

She replied “ What the fuck is wrong with you , don’t you see I’m shopping “"
33,"Having lived in different parts of the US, there are so many uniquely distinct and cool places all over. Have a good friend who lived in DC their whole life, and said the one thing they regretted (as an older person) was having never lived anywhere else. 
If you’re young, have few tie-downs keeping you there, why not try something else on for a few years? If it doesn’t work you can always go back. Best of luck!"
34,"Unlike most cities, NYC DOS has it's own recycling sorting facilities. We can do the hard work of sorting and then sell the purer product back to manufactures.

Places in the NYT article, mostly cities on the west coast, outsourced the sorting work to places in China. They now have to make the choice of finding new domestic sorters, building there own expensive sorters, or just dumping it in a landfill."
35,I was on the L a Saturday morning a few months back and on comes John Mulaney and his wife. They sat practically across from in an empty car with just me and one other person at the far end. I wanted to say hi but every scenario in my head just came up with me looking like an ass so I didn't say anything.
36,People are always annoyed about something. Don't overthinking it. You'll learn as you go.
37,"When ""mind your business"" culture goes too far. I was recently being harassed big-time by a clearly mentally unstable man on the train, even after I told him to leave me alone. Multiple big dudes sitting nearby and they all did the ""close your eyes and pretend this podcast is REALLY absorbing"" thing. 

So I moved to the next car, and the man followed me to further harass me. I had to approach a random big dude and ask him to help me out. Turns out he was undercover NYPD lol. So he gently escorted dude off the train at the next stop.

Just wish more people were willing to help people, especially women, out of clearly dicey situations. I'm not ever about playing the helpless woman, but I have seen a simple ""hey man, leave her alone"" from a guy work wonders more than once."
38,"That's almost exactly my rent.

I keep a very detailed budget and can give you the average numbers since last November. All of the numbers below are per month, averaged over the period from November 2018 through today. I'm using a throwaway for this.

* **Net monthly income: $7,498**
* Food: $854 (12%, includes alcohol)
* Husband/marriage: $1,781 (25%, includes December wedding dinner)
* Home: $338 (5%)
* Merchandise: $522 (7%, over one-third of this is gifts)
* Health/beauty: $172 (2%)
* Savings $700 (10%, doesn't include pretax 401k contributions, which I don't count towards net income)
* Vacations/travel $618 (9%, includes subway costs)
* All other bills: $283 (4%)"
39,"But if you're giving directions to a place that's between intersections, you'd say ""3rd Ave between 86th and 87th."""
40,"North is uptown, south is downtown. You refer to the corners as the southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest corners to let people know where something/you are. 


You give directions to tourists, but feel free to ignore anyone for any reason if you feel like it. 


Always have headphones on/in. 


Help people in trouble when you spot it. 



Don’t give people money on the streets or in the subway, no matter what. If you don’t believe me, try offering a nature valley bar to them and you’ll understand why. 


Bitch about the MTA. Everyone loves to do that"
41,I’d revoke permission for them to come in unless they telephone you first. You tried to be accommodating and instead this is what you’d got.
42,this! I take one day every week to simply walk a shit ton around the city while listening to my music. I call it urban hiking
43,"Always wear a condom: whether you're fucking, being fucked, or not sure what's going on."
44,"canal, mott. that whole area where they have the fish markets on the street."
45,Because people are disgusting.
46,Going to movies alone is one of my guilty pleasures.
47,"King of Shwarma in Astoria, Queens."
48,"Houston Street is not how it’s pronounced in Texas, it’s HOUSE-TON. 

If you are in one of the the outer boroughs, don’t say you’re going into NYC, just say “the city.”

Don’t ask people where a restroom is. You’re on your own to find one and you probably need to go to a restaurant or bar because stores generally don’t let you use the bathroom. 

Instead of saying pizza, you can say fun things like slice and pie. 

Don’t walk slow. Ever."
49,****Lemmegettuuuuuuuuhhhhh***
50,"Littering, and then staring at you as if it is their birth right to litter."
51,"Theater seat-filler clubs like [Play by Play](https://www.play-by-play.com/) and [Theatermania Gold Club.](https://www.theaterclub.com/ny/signup)

You get free or discounted (plus $5 processing fee/ticket) to Broadway shows, Off-Broadway shows, concerts, lounge acts, burlesque, sporting events etc. for a low annual membership fee."
52,"Keep to the right when going up/down stairs. On escalators, keep to the right if you won't be walking - the left is for people who want to pass.   
Keep your pace and direction (no zig-zags!) when walking on the sidewalk - if you sense someone wants to pass you but they don't have the space, let them through.   


It is Long Island Railroad or L.I.R.R. (pronounced as individual letters - El-Eye-Ar-Ar), and not \*Leer\* as I thought for months. TBH - \*Leer\* is much faster and easier to say but whatevs, NYC. :)   


Please for the love of all that is good and holy, use your headphones on public transportation, don't talk too loud on your cell phone, and the correct time to FaceTime in public is never."
53,"Depends on how broke I am at the moment.

We actually have a window AC unit now. These habits were formed back when I was living on $11/hour and was lucky to get 30 hours a week. Now we'll run the AC for a few hours if there's company or it's really hot, but still don't often run it all night or anything."
54,Thank you. Don’t come into our city and wear that shit. You know we don’t want it here.
55,"Er, keep to the right."
56,Jersey city
57,what is a bodega CAT?
58,"I'm on a T-Mobile unlimited family plan with my sister. We pay $120 total (including taxes). We also get a free Netflix subscription with our plan. Yes, you are being jerked off. We were being jerked off by Verizon previously. $150 for a 4gb data plan. It was crazy."
59,Of course you can have visitors. Seems like some random tenant is staring out their peephole waiting for a chance to dial 911
60,"I think it's really fucked up and the ""smirk"" and attitudes from the men would make me extremely upset and unnerved. (Also happy cake day!)"
61,"It is OKAY to stop on sidewalks! Obviously there are many reasons why you may need to do so. BUT if you're going to stop on the sidewalk, find a piece of furniture like a trashcan or bus shelter or lamp or whatever and stand next to that so that you don't block anybody's way."
62,i hope u know it’s sleepy time
63,"If you see ICE doing a raid in your area record and report them.  They can't enter a home without a warrant signed by a judicial court not DHS.

You can print info around your neighborhood on what to do if ICE comes to people's door. Let people know they have rights and what they are.  This person posted a helpful infographic on Twitter; https://twitter.com/RoseMirabella03/status/1142314620662644747?s=19

Be vigilant and watch out for each other."
64,All the comments makes my unemployed life even more miserable haha.
65,Was literally telling a friend of mine the other day that between 34-35th St. on 6ave has to be the worst smelling section
66,"Not so much colors as costumes - leather vests with no shirt, Yankees baseball uniforms with painted faces, satin vest and fedora, overalls, dirty t-shirts, etc."
67,"* It's a ""plain slice"" of pizza, not a ""cheese slice""
* We measure distances in blocks, not miles
   * General rule of thumb, 20 blocks is roughly a mile
* Baconeggandcheeseonaroll is one word
* If you get a bagel at Starbucks or Dunkin', fuck right off and move back to wherever you came from"
68,"I grew up with it as ""L-I-double-R""."
69,"If you’re in one of the outer boroughs, the city is Manhattan. If you’re outside NYC, the city means all of the boroughs."
70,$1 pizza slices. Eat up
71,THIS! I noticed people doing this when I was in the Midwest. I thought it was so rude that they were having friendly conversations when there was an hour long line at the car rental...
72,"&gt; Use green cabs and not fucking Uber.
&gt; 
&gt; Call local restaurants direct to order as opposed to the fuckery of Seamless (otherwise you’re effectively putting them out of business).

I am a New Yorker who does the opposite of both of these things daily, along with everyone else I know!"
73,Not NY specific but the cat calling in NYC in the summer
74,"When the train is so packed and a couple with a stroller tries to force their way in. Also baby strollers that are wide open, but the kid isnt sitting in the seat"
