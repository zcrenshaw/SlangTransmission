0,But How would you even qualify based on the 40x requirement?
1,"i've never heard of this and Queens is full of pre-war buildings. I know some people who live in them too. Jackson Heights as well.

&amp;#x200B;

check out the HPD or department of housing website"
2,"Yes, Mos def.   you may need to keep its usage on the DL, but there is nothing wrong with carrying in or out."
3,"Yes, very normal."
4,"Here are a few ways to get around the rule: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/40x-rent-rule-nyc-262581

Anyway, it's not a requirement, it's a guideline - a hedge against someone not paying their rent if they lose their job."
5,60%+? Is that considered normal? I know the city is expensive (I live here myself) but 60% is not a smart financial decision.
6,Eh I‚Äôd be pretty pissed if I went outside to sit on my balcony and everything was wet because my neighborhood decided to hose theirs off.
7,Sounds gross
8,Keep doing it.
9,This is terrible. Are you a plumber?
10,What the fuck are you talking about? Where are you pulling this information from
11,"One thing I'd like to note is that liquidity for private stock has increased dramatically within the last few years. Companies themselves are doing a lot of buybacks and there are a lot of investors looking to buy stock. My company provides cash against shares/options to help employees exercise their stock options, which makes the stock/equity part less risky. Of course, this all is contingent on the company doing very well and experiencing hyper growth!"
12,The question was if it's legal.
13,No.  The owner needs to fix the pipes.
14,"Not necessarily, but it does make it a pain in the @$$. And my co-op would sue me for breaking this rule.

EDITED to say ""not necessarily"" b/c see below"
15,That's not what illegal means.
16,"I've seen this a couple of times. In fact, I stayed at an Airbnb once where you couldn't flush toilet paper (left after one night).

Is it legal? Dunno. But it's not as uncommon as you may think"
17,"I‚Äôm sure you can. It‚Äôs not a question of whether it‚Äôs legal or not because the NYPD isn‚Äôt going to arrest you for flushing toilet paper. 

It‚Äôs more like if you do flush toilet paper, what‚Äôs the landlord going to do? If he goes to court to sue you for civil damages, he‚Äôll have to prove your piece of toilet paper did actual damage to the pipes(to at which point, the judge will just laugh him out of the court room)"
18,"Also have a good health insurance plan, because you will need it when you wreck the bike."
19,8 miles is less than an hour in good weather.  Possibly 30 minutes if you get into good enough shape.
20,"Mughlai is a good indian spot on East Houston and Clinton in the LES. 

Curry chicken and garlic naan were super good.  üòã"
21,"7.5 windows in a 2br.

We have 2.5 (2 normal and one small sized) windows in the living room, in which we installed a window unit in one of them.

1 window in the kitchen and bathroom, 2 windows in one bedroom (with one AC unit installed) and one window in the smaller bedroom. No AC unit in there since it‚Äôs the fire escape, but we might get a portable one next summer.

I‚Äôm not sure that 1 window in a bedroom is common, what‚Äôs more important is are you comfortable where you live and can you do better (and would it be worth the cost of moving)?

To me, I would prefer to be happy where I live rather than fight about it in a dark hot room with no windows, but you gotta weigh options."
22,"Your landlord can‚Äôt arbitrarily make you improve or alter the apartment. What is the specific reason they are telling you to do this? Did you have any role on putting the wall up, or did you alter it in any way?"
23,"we‚Äôre in a prewar 2BR less than $3000 and only have A/C in each bedroom. living room and kitchen have large fans and open windows but that‚Äôs it. so yeah, we just deal with being a little hot inside sometimes!"
24,I work in a company doing SaaS that targets FP&amp;A offices. I would not take anything less than 55k in the city. Ideally you'd be 60~65k+ fresh out of college.
25,I've done this in Europe (Italy and Greece) but never North America
26,I think you're the first person ever to order the ribs...
27,"Prime rib (no ""s"") is a completely different dish than ""ribs""."
28,"I really like Ridgeway Diner on 6th Ave. between 20th and 21st. Fair prices, comfortable atmosphere, and good food. I wouldn't describe it as a ""must try"" place, but it's definitely my go-to for breakfast in Midtown."
29,"We aren‚Äôt, I swear!!"
30,"Yes. That be like telling smokers they have to throw away their cigarettes and lighter every time they enter a venue. Of course you are not supposed to use it inside, but having it in your possesion should be fine"
31,"Well four people, regardless of fitness level or size (not really sure how that‚Äôs relevant?) could do some damage to a toilet with daily usage if the pipes aren‚Äôt up to the frequency or size of defecation.

Just keep pooping and wiping. 

Or get a bidet."
32,"The modern day subway system is the amalgamation of three separate, competing systems that were only combined in the 40s, which is responsible for the lack of integration and interoperability.

Combining neighboring stations requires wildly expensive underground construction, which is why it doesn't always happen. The particular example you cite, though, has been effectively unified by the Oculus, which cost a cool $3 billion."
33,It‚Äôs a shit starter. Literally.
34,"What if you ask the super to fix the toilet when it breaks, all while doing two things:

1) say you‚Äôre not continuing flushing toilet paper

2) continue flushing toilet paper"
35,"I don‚Äôt live in the Marais anymore, and I don‚Äôt agree with the gilet jaunes. I live in a very nice apartment in a very nice area (not that it should matter - you don‚Äôt put people down who are poorer than you)

I don‚Äôt know what happened to you in life that you‚Äôre so miserable, but I hope things get better for you."
36,http://chipsonline.org/get-involved/
37,Not to mention: keeping shit covered TP in a trash can is NOT good for your health.
38,"You should definitely call 311 and report this as a housing violation. 

FYI, apart from pads, tampons, and other hygiene products, folks should also refrain from flushing ‚Äúflushable‚Äù wipes. Those do wreak havoc on sewer systems and can clog pipes."
39,MTA will be disbanded and re-privatized
40,"I had a friend who's roommate did this.

They didnt know each other prior and the girl with the original lease put out something for 2 roommates. One would live in a flex wall space, one would get a legit room and the girl renting it would get the big room with her own bathroom. 

The girl with the flex room paid the least and knew it. But my friend who lived in the legit room, paid MORE than the girl with the nicer room. But she didn't find out for a few years. 

They became friends because of being roommates. THEN when the new lease came around, my friend found out she was paying the most even though the other girls room was double the size and had its own bathroom. Let's just say it cause a lot of problems within their friendship. 

BUT on the otherhand you are furnishing it.

Either way I would just be upfront about it."
41,Make sure they're paying their fair share of the rent.
42,"Be up front about it. If it‚Äôs less than they would pay elsewhere, and it‚Äôs a good deal for them, many people would still do it. If they don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs fair, they can pass. Then be guilt-free."
43,"A shit-storm, Randy!"
44,"Not even remotely. Renters don't usually pay a water bill, but bldg/home owners sure do.  Would you leave the lights on 24/7 if you didn't have a utility bill for power?"
45,1200 with roommates is pretty realistic in upper manhattan. It's pretty hard to find anywhere in Manhattan that's even remotely unsafe these days
46,"No, NYC's actually in somewhat of a water crisis.  It's two operational water tunnels are aging out and without question [leaking millions of gallons a day](https://www.apnews.com/fcce6bb47e6a4e0590e0ef1c5812fad0). If one goes out of service, the city is going to be in crisis.  

That's why Bloomberg and de blasio started pushing to spend so much money on a third tunnel to speed the project up, so one of the other tunnels can be shut down for proper repair.  It's just a matter of time before the city's water supply gets cut in half.  
If this happens before the new tunnel is fully operational it's going to be something of epic proportions."
47,"The more likely scenario, as some have pointed out in earlier comments than mine, is that the landlord would be prosecuted for not providing plumbing that was in line with city codes, and be required to replace all of the problematic plumbing."
48,"They do have a point - with a stabilized unit and a lease ending 12/31, the landlord is in a _much_ better position with them moving out early. They'd have to turn it over either way, but now they can probably find someone more quickly whenever they have future turnover and minimize vacancy. Relatively few people want to move in 1/1."
49,He's the best. I have over 15 of his pieces in my apartment and he's a genuinely nice guy.
50,good stuff -- thanks
51,"I think you‚Äôre talking about Joey Allgood at Real.  Weird.  Art. 
His website is http://www.realweirdart.com/weirdwalls and instagram is @realweirdart."
52,"I think it's debatable whether that would be a ""problem"". I mean, if it's the kind that seduced Ray Stantz in the original Ghostbusters it might be a selling point."
53,"I'm sure the dad didn't mean literal plaster. He was undoubtedly thinking more along the lines of papier-m√¢ch√©, with little pieces getting stuck to crags in the pipes and building up over time. Not something that should happen with properly-maintained plumbing, though."
54,Thanks for all the advice. I'm hoping these facts will convince him to  just take a bath.
55,"&gt;My plan is to not pay rent this month and let the landlord keep my security deposit as the rent.

I gotta warn you, most places will not let you do this, especially as the security deposit has to be kept in an escrow, interest-bearing account. Then again, if you have a non-management-company landlord, they might go for it.

How is your relationship with your landlord? Is it good enough that you can call and say, ""We've received an opportunity to move our growing family, and while I know our lease is through December, I wondered if it would be beneficial for us both to discuss our options here. We'd love to give you the apartment before then, ideally in September, so you don't have to go through the slow season of finding tenants!"""
56,"What I did is just fold up an old towel and put it on the A/C, worked like a charm."
57,"Honestly, not any grosser than a diaper genie, and almost all new parents use something like that. When the lid is closed the odor is contained, and you just make sure you empty it as often as your local trash collection will allow."
58,"I got the senior half fare easy-pay card when I turned 65 and it was the greatest thing, I never worry about having to run to refill it somewhere, or trying to scrounge up $2.75 in quarters.  It did take a little while to fill out the form with the special photo which had to be notarized and then mailed to Brooklyn I think (or maybe it's the Bronx) anyway it makes taking the bus way easier now, however I did have to wait about a month to receive it."
59,what? that has to be illegal. He expects you to wipe your ass then but the toilet paper in the garbage? what???? that's insane.
60,"Does he ever come out of these long showers with his hair dry?

If so, he‚Äôs proba...never mind."
61,You should leave someone that dumb.
62,"Second this. I just had to cut a strip about 4"" deep to go on the back portion of my AC to stop the drips from above and avoid blocking the vents on the top of the unit."
63,"Can vouch for The Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine and they‚Äôre great. I guess I wouldn‚Äôt call them cheap, but since it‚Äôs so specialized, I think that‚Äôs to be expected."
64,I never understood why testing for weed isn‚Äôt a HIPAA violation.
65,Ok why would you _glue_ foam to the unit instead of using one of the magnetic drip pads multiple people linked?
66,"I've had good experiences with everyone that's cut my hair there. There's an asian woman (I can't remember her name, but she's the only woman there) that has the seat closest to the far wall that I usually wait for"
67,"The ""northern"" and ""southern"" terms are anachronisms devised by immigrants from the north who needed to find a simple way of differentiating themselves from the many restaurants whose cuisine emphasized the more southern regions of Italy. But Italy has 20 regions, and the cuisine is different in each. For example, if you want to experience Pugliese cuisine, try I Trulli or Leuca."
68,Yes!!! Thank you so much!!
69,I had one from Udon West last night and was satisfied with the amount of meat they put on the rice.
70,"Mine are included 

Otherwise they would $7 a line or so"
71,Didn‚Äôt work :/ read online that a lot of people can‚Äôt set it to Queens or Brooklyn and it‚Äôs a bug.  thanks for being the only person on here for who wasn‚Äôt an ass.
72,"I saw this some places in Russia but even there I never saw it in a private home / apartment (although maybe it happens). Regardless, as you point out, it‚Äôs way outside US norms. I would raise hell over this ‚Äî first with the landlord directly if this came from the super, then with the city if needed. 

In the meantime, unless it‚Äôs backing up into your apartment or something, I would probably just keep flushing the TP. Maybe that‚Äôs not responsible but I cannot imagine having a bucket of used paper in my little apartment bathroom or ever asking guests to do that."
73,"Haha, thanks!"
74,Hell no! Charities in NYC don't even accept used mattresses; no way I'm going to.
75,"Are you guaranteed 40hrs a week?  And would you get overtime pay?  40hrs wk x $21 x 50 weeks a year (assuming 2 unpaid vacation weeks) = $42k/yr.  if you‚Äôre working OT, you‚Äôre likely making your target comp.  for salaried jobs, you work OT for free.

I hear you on it not being what you want to do, but sometimes one thing could eventually lead you to what you want to do.  It‚Äôs a tough decision when you have other interviews pending, though.  I assume you had limited time to accept that offer, so you couldn‚Äôt wait to see how the others pan out.

If I was desperate for money, I would have accepted the offer but keep my eyes open for something I really wanted to do.  It‚Äôs not the best thing, but it happens all the time that people leave jobs shortly in because of a better opportunity.  Just be respectful when you leave, even if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely you will cross paths again"
76,"Beacon, NY + Dia"
77,"It‚Äôs legal for owners of two families (maybe also three?) who occupy one of the units to rent out their second unit for less than 30 days in NYC. In my experience, that‚Äôs usually the cheapest legal way to find an entire apartment for short term rental (via AirBnB), most likely in Queens or Brooklyn."
