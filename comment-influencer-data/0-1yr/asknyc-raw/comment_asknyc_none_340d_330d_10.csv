0,"If you try to get on the Subway before I get off, you're getting walked into. These rules exist for a reason."
1,"Some gentrification is awesome.

As much as I love my neighborhood, some local bars have shitty, toxic masculinity cock measuring shithole cultures and they have shit drinks. Some local food places are shit, admit it. We don't need 5 dollar stores within 20 blocks. So yes, I love the new Thai food place, I love the new cafe, and I want those new bars, as long as they don't completely take over. And yes, I want a bubble tea place too."
2,"We need to get away from “NYC exceptionalism” and actually learn from best practices in other global cities. Other cities have figured out public transit, airports, traffic, trash collection, sidewalk design, etc much better than we have. Let’s learn from them and stop pretending we are too good for that or that things are just different here. "
3,Sublet. Break the lease. Whatever you need to do. Eat the costs and get some sleep. 
4,"NYC real estate developers are greedy and irresponsible. NYC rent regulations are counterproductive, irresponsible, and have served to impoverish and entrap the people they are supposed to be helping. The housing crisis is due to a combination of shitty developers and bad governance. It needs to change. "
5,Lemmegetabaconeggncheese. 
6,"I'm personally partial to yiddishisms, like ""putzing around"" or ""schlepping across town"""
7,"This sounds like an awful idea. Your wet clothes would stink within an hour of coming out of the machine. Then some poor guy has to carry this insanely heavy bag to your building, where it sits and gets even more smelly.
Can you go to your local laundry and explain that you'd like to use their services, but want everything dried on low heat? Tell them you're happy to pay a little extra for the service."
8,"Any guy who hands you a hot sandwich over a counter is ""boss"""
9,"“You Good” has about 10 meanings based on how you say it. Here’s a few.. You good? Is “are you ok?, You good.. is “it’s cool or no problem”, you good?! Is confrontational is someone looks like they want beef. "
10,"Stand in front of the subway stairs and check your phone and I might body-check you 

And don't get me started on slow tourists walking side by side on the sidewalk"
11,"""Dead Ass"" is synonymous with ""seriously"""
12,"If you have one of those enormous baby carriages and bring them on the subway during rush hour, I hate you. 

Sorry, but it’s true. It’s fine if the kid is an infant, but there’s a guy who gets on before me on the subway who has one that takes up THREE PEOPLE worth of space and his kid is like 5? And it’s insane. "
13,I fucking hate subway dancers. 
14,"I had a cab driver who always wanted be driven by one of his passengers, so right on 5th ave and 23rd st, he got out, hopped in the back, and I jumped in the front and drove the rest of the way there."
15,always walk on your right side of the sidewalk. not the left. 
16,"During the blackout of 2003, at around 2AM, I walked through a completely dark Times Square.

It was surreal."
17,Not for nothin' but...
18,I feel like not having a plan would add mystique to your walkabout.
19,"Have a 1 night stand, forget to end things."
20,"Not slang but characteristic. As a Californian living here for a while, “on line.” It’s WEIRD!! It sounds normal to people from here but I will never get used to it and will say “in line.”"
21,"Way, way too much of this city is devoted to cars and free parking for them.  Get rid of all the free parking and cut down on the driving lanes too.  We're the densest city in all of the US; surely we can have large, nice pedestrian-friendly plazas like many smaller European cities do?  Cars can't be used for even a fraction of people in Manhattan getting around anyway (they simply take up too much space), so why do they have so much space dedicated to them?  Make the sidewalks wider, put in better bus and bike lanes, and get rid of most of the car space."
22,"I mean, it's a Spanish word, but my Pittsburgh mother had no idea what I was talking about when I referenced running to the bodega real quick. Elsewhere, it's just a ""corner store"" or a ""convenience shop"" or something else."
23,Lemmegetta is definitely my favorite 
24,Definitely have done my fair share of shoulder bumps.
25,"Brick (another word for freezing). ""Yo it's brick outside"" "
26,"New yuppie neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan feel like they have their own different parallel society and culture. Not a good or bad thing, it just feels pretty strange growing up in Jamaica and Astoria my whole life and visiting Williamsburg with coworkers from Ohio and Seattle. 

All of the white friends I had growing up were European (Greek, Russian, Bukharian, Yugoslavic) so I never really had a lot of experience interacting with American whites until this past decade or so. "
27,"I believe there are two different noise complaints. You do not need the police. You need the DEP. Use this [link](https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2549/noise-from-club-or-bar)

DEP will call you and set up a home visit. If they miss you, you will have to re-start the process. It takes longer to get an evening appt. They will bring a decibel meter and issue a violation. If it is uncorrected, call again. The fine doubles each time. Eventually it will hurt enough that they will mitigate the noise. Good luck. "
28,"&gt;How do people fine love in NYC?

I'm a guy but here's my perspective.

The short answer to your question is yes the Apps work.

The long answer is that apps are what you make of them. Most people go into dating with the objective of having fun. And that's, just don't be surprised when that objective leads you to find other people who are *also* looking to have fun and who aren't interested in settling down. 

In my experience, I (and others in my friend group) found success when we got over the romantic notion of stumbling into the right person and started treating dating as more of a job than a hobby. Tons of first dates,  weeding out people obviously not interested in relationships (even if they are fun and hot), and aggressively ending hookups/flings that aren't worth it. 

Prior to meeting my SO I was doing 2+ first dates a week for a few months and to do that I was spending roughly 30-45 minutes a day swiping and messaging on the apps (I used Hinge and Coffee meets Bagel primarily). And while it was cool meeting all these new people (and some were really great) the experience wasn't ""fun"". However it felt extremely necessary to get to where I wanted to be."
29,"my SO was trying to remember the name of Camilla Cabello (""you know, Havana na na na?""), and called her ""Cecilia Bodega"" which, honestly, is a great name."
30,"I was a part of the indiegogo crowdfunder for the Bose sleepbuds. They work great. 

Hey, I’m in Gramercy. I actually have a second pair of them (they retail for $250 new). Got them because I returned defective prototypes and they never asked for the replacements back. 

If you want, OP (only), I’ll give them to you for free. Your situation sounds like hell, and you really do need your sleep. Send me a message. We can meet at Union Square on Sat or Sun. 
"
31,"the problem isnt us being ""too good"", its that our politicians arent spending the money needed to fix the MTA"
32,And they say English isn't a tonal language. Checkmate linguists
33,"Well, this isn't anything about -me- specifically; however, one time I was telling my friend I had seen everything there was to see on the subway (pooping, masturbators, peeing, someone sleeping in a literal tent), but I had never seen anyone smoking. To me, smoking always seemed like something you'd see before having seen the above mentioned things. WELL five minutes after I tell my friend this, we get in a crowded car and the woman I'm standing in front of pulls out a MASSIVE blunt, lights it, and starts smoking. Ask and you shall receive, I guess."
34,Real talk... do we need 100 hair salons per block as well?
35,You move and learn to do your due diligence in the future. The bar was there before you and you moved to a party neighborhood. 
36,"Son, that ain't the entire length of Broadway. Broadway ends in Sleepy Hollow!"
37,"You can do this for free. There are promoters everywhere during the weekends near the club spots that are willing to take you into clubs and get you free alcohol (they get paid to bring in girls to clubs). 

There is no reason you should be paying that high for something that you could be getting for free! If you want to try out a particular club, try searching it on Yelp or Google. There are usually promoters commenting their numbers in the review sections offering free alcohol/a table.

They usually gather a large group outside near the club before going in altogether at a certain time. You usually just need to text the promoter beforehand and they’ll let you know the time/place etc. I’ve gone alone a couple of times and met some awesome girls in my group. 

Have fun and enjoy the city!"
38,"Encountering a bouncer at a bar who seemed off in a menacing way. 

A week later he killed that student and dumped her body in Brooklyn. 

The bar was The Falls and the bouncer was Darryl Littlejohn.  "
39,"Keep your fuckin dog at home. Serious. They don’t need to be at restaurants, on subways, at bars. They’re pets. 

And I don’t fuckin believe your dog is a emotional support animal. "
40,"Either Kelsey is high or I am, because I'm pretty sure she first told you $180 a month was incredibly low, then told you she pays $30 a week for someone to clean a 3,500 square foot house with like 45 animals in it and that $180 a month was incredibly high, but it didn't matter because the comparison she gave you herself was a bad one?"
41,Everyone who's not a tourist does.
42,"If a drag queen hasn't scooped that name up yet, she should."
43,"Calling someone or something ""Bridge and Tunnel"" means someone who is not a Manhattanite (in terms of attitude, dress, sophistication, etc).

ie ""Oh, that club sucks. It's so bridge and tunnel.""

Although now that ""cool"" NYC has expanded beyond Manhattan, I've heard B+T used as meaning people from just general suburbs (Long Island, NJ, Staten Island, Westchester, etc). 

ie ""Bushwick used to be cool but its getting so Bridge and Tunnel"" or something like that.

(Okay, seriously someone downvoted me? It's a real slang word in NYC, and you know it)"
44,"“Yerrrr” is a NY callout to your friends when you see them in the street or you just need to get someone’s attention. Can also be used in text as a replacement to “yo, hey, hi” and all that "
45,"Get a white noise machine instead of using the AC. I highly recommend the Lectrofan, there are 20 different types of white noise to choose from and they are all non-looping. I've tried a few and it is by far the best one.
I don't really have a a suggestion for the bass problem though, sorry."
46,Trailer Park Lounge
47,Schlepping my way downtown
48,i dont think i have one so that makes me the weird neighbor. 
49,"Our train got stopped in 23rd St station, and they for some reason didn't open the doors. We were stopped about 2 full minutes or so, and people started getting really antsy after about 20 seconds of no-doors-opening.

This especially annoyed, kind of schlubby-looking middle-aged businessman was just like, ""Jesus fucking Christ. These fucking idiots. Fucking hell."" And then he angrily cursed his way over to the door between cars and started climbing onto those heavy chains that link the cars together.

Someone else opened the door and was like, ""Hey man, don't try it,"" and the first guy was like, ""Eyyy, what the fuck'm I supposed to do?!""

Then he just climbed over the chains, and leapt like a cat onto the platform and walked away.

Like... he looked like he's done this before."
50,"I was telling a friend that I don't think I've ever seen a white woman driving a yellow cab. Within 15 seconds a cab pulled up next to us with a mid 30's long haired pretty white lady.

Just looked it up, 1% of medallion drivers are women.

Also, apparently there is a suicide epidemic among cabbies. Be cool to your driver."
51,"I enjoy the ads for Target's delivery service that say ""Shop without the schlep"" because there's no other city in this country that those ads could exist in."
52,"My guy is top 5 DOA NYC slang.

"
53,"I'm going to add ""mad"" to this for another good NY slang word. 

""Yo, its mad brick out!"" (It's very cold out)
