0,"* Never get on the mysteriously empty subway car. It's empty for a reason.

* If you pay for your own electricity, and someone comes to the door talking about your electricity plan and trying to get you to sign something, DO NOT SIGN IT. They aren't from ConEd, they're a private electricity supplier trying to get you to change plans. They use high pressure tactics to try and get you to sign, and do stuff like make it sound like this is some discount deal or refund. Don't fall for it. The plan they have you sign up for will probably suck, and you may get early cancellation fees from your old plan.

* That said, don't stick with the default electricity plan you get from ConEd either. That's a variable rate plan, meaning the cost of electricity can change at any time. Do some research and find a fixed rate plan. You can find information about electricity providers [**here**](https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/shop-for-energy-service-companies/how-to-choose-your-energy-supplier) and [**here**](https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/shop-for-energy-service-companies/find-your-esco).

* There will be an adjustment period. Don't beat yourself up or think you can't make it here if you feel overwhelmed or lonely or stressed out here. If you decide this isn't the city for you that's valid, but if you really want to stay here give yourself a few years to learn how to live here comfortably.

* The lack of eye contact and casual interaction with strangers in public isn't rudeness; that's how people respect each other's privacy here. When you walk past thousands of people just going to work, and spend 45 minutes on a train crammed so tight you can identify three stranger's brand of antiperspirant, personal space only exists on the inside.

* We respect each other's privacy, but we aren't ogres. If you need help, ask someone. Just be direct and succinct; we don't need your life story, just ask if you're on the right train platform or how to get to Canal st. Giving too many details is likely to send up red flags; the person you're talking to may think this is a lead up to a request for money or something.

* New Yorkers love giving directions. However, we often love giving directions even if we aren't that certain of how to get there. So if you ask strangers for directions, ask several people separately and see if you get the same answer.

* A lot more of personal life is lived in public here than is true most places. We commute in public, wash our clothes in public, work out in public, and if we want to sit under a tree and read a book it will probably be in a public park surrounded by hundreds of other people rather than in a private back yard. And there's a good chance you'll be living with roommates, possibly strangers you met off the internet, so even your own living room and kitchen aren't entirely private. It takes some getting used to."
1,made it to not being dead
2,"The first year is godamn impossible. You'll have so many feelings of regret, doubt, pity, loneliness... but it gets better, and before you know it it's the best decision of your life and living here is a dream come true. 

Everyone I know who's a transplant has that 'first year' story. Just power through, it's worth it!"
3,"I was a teenager here in the mid 00s. I took trains and cabs alone. Went to St. Marks at 7pm and thought I was hot shit. Knew all the bodegas and restaurants that served underage. Went to diners late at night because we couldn't hang out in bars (yeah you can get a fake, but they don't always work.) Went to weird loft parties. Had way more independence than kids I know who didn't grow up here."
4,Start small. Just go sit in the park and read a book.
5,Oh...I thought you were serious. I was gonna recommend this place exactly like that that also has the best pizza in the city but I guess I won't
6,I mean ya gotta eat
7,Buy a plunger before you need a plunger.
8,"I’d say it’s definitely common, and not just NY. 

I’ve lived in LA, Toronto and NY and most the time we’d be meeting up at restaurants and bars. 

I will say the closer I am with people the more our activities get expanded, like hikes, parks, museums, some kind of workout class, hanging out at one another’s place etc but if they’re just casual friends and not close friends than yeah it’s usually restaurants, bars or going to the movies."
9,Make sure not to ask someone else for direction in front of the person you had just asked lol. That’s mad insulting
10,I'm only interested if it's a non-toursity hidden gem that's only 15 minutes from Times Square.
11,The humidity definitely makes NYC worse.
12,"Try it for a few months and then reevaluate. Banking a few months rent will give you a lot of flexibility when you decide to eventually rent in the city.

That being said, this totally depends on your relationship with your parents and if you think it’s good for your mental health to stay"
13,See how it goes commuting for a bit. Even if you only last a month you'll have saved $1600. Some people manage to deal with this and still have a bit of a social life after work (a coworker of mine did this for 2 years and still went out for dinners...she just didn't get home until 11pm-midnight and had to wake up by 6am the next day.) Other people can't stand it for more than a few weeks. If you can find something to do on the train it'll make your life a little easier.
14,"This article might help. I love that some people are curious about small things. I am one of those people,

https://convene.com/catalyst/buildings-new-york-city-own-zip-code/"
15,"Yea it’s pretty great. There’s a lot of different functions of a sanitation worker. House to house collection, mechanical broom, picking up corner baskets, litter patrol, snow removal and much more. Some functions are better than others and what you do depends entirely on seniority.  A lot of the work is very strenuous, for example on one collection route (one truck) we average 8-12 tons of garbage, picked up by hand.

I love the job. The pay is good. Benefits are great. It’s like a fraternity amongst the workers which is nice. We perform an important service for the city and we have fun doing it."
16,"As does the need to be outside frequently. Often in crowded spaces and hot subway stations with long train delays. And the buildings and sidewalks just trap and radiate heat like a whole street of pizza stones. And the trash water and piss start to heat up and smell. 

But man I love this city."
17,"My problem is **space**. Coming from Florida, I now regret not having appreciated all the space we had... a bathroom you can actually move around in.. rooms that are bigger than sizes of closets.. kitchens where you can spread out and prep/cook... 


I’ve been doing a lot of laying in bed because I guess.. I’m sad?"
18,"Hey, thank you for sharing and seeking help here. I relate to much of your story - I struggle with ADHD comorbid with depression and have been out of work since March.

Exercise is the number #1 best thing you can do for yourself, and it's a great solo activity to get outside. I bought a bike a bit on a whim during my unemployment and it's opened an entirely new perspective of the city for me. Biking around Central Park, Riverside, and downtown is both therapeutic and exciting.

A bike may not be your thing, and that's alright. Any form of movement, including walking, is beneficial and will grow your brain &amp; mind for the better. It's more fun and rewarding when it's something that you enjoy.

Being out of work in the city can be risky &amp; damaging to your mental if you're not disciplined. I know for certain I'm in a better state of mind when I have a inherent purpose through my job and its attached culture &amp; social environment.

Best of luck to you, and try to be kind to yourself, because you do deserve it."
19,"And $2 beers/$4 cocktails and the fastest, cheapest way to get there and back on a 25 minute layover from JFK."
20,"Former boss said ""in NYC restaurants are an extension of people's living rooms"", he's not wrong."
21,"Become your own best friend.  I moved here over 20 years ago (right out of uni) and didn't know a single person - only had a job and corporate housing.  Took awhile for me to find my footing but every weekend I forced myself to do something outside of my comfort zone:  Go to a movie/restaurant/museum/bar alone, etc.  Over time I made friends through work and started to create a social circle.  Few years later met the love of my life.  It does get easier but the first few years are all about the struggle. You've got this!"
22,Sling it.  Women do it in Africa with no issues over heating right?
23,"Midnight Cop. It takes a toll mentally and physically work at that time. Your diet is garbage because nothings open, your sleep schedule is completely non existent, exercise schedule is whenever you get a second wind. the people you respond to are drunk, emotionally disturbed, or dont take no for an answer. 
It's the equivalent of banging your head against a wall for 22.5 years.  People monday morning quarterback you. 

 People not on scene, with no trainning or experience, and with 20/20 hindsight telling you ""well if you did this everything would have turned out better."
24,General surgery resident. Hopefully you won’t need my services
25,"I was a teenager here in the '90s. I can't speak to what the kids of today are doing, but to answer some of your questions:

1) There's no age limit to take public transportation, and most kids start traveling alone relatively young. I was taking the train to school by myself at about 12. 


2) School sizes in NYC vary wildly. Brooklyn Tech has 1,400 students per grade. My school had 39."
26,Prospect Park
27,"As a native New Yorker this post deserves more than an upvote.  Totally on point.  Especially the directions part, really made me laugh.  The second someone starts talking to me I make a split second decision as to whether they genuinely need help or this is just a long lead up to asking me for $3.47 to take the bus back to Fucksville.  

Also, walk fast and don’t stand on the staircase leading down to the subway."
28,I’m a sanitation worker in Brooklyn and I work 12am to 8am fairly often. I like it because there’s a lot less traffic so it makes the job easier. I don’t like it because it really messes up any chance of getting enough sleep.
29,There is an off the books Olive Garden in Greenpoint located in an abandoned water tower right near Transmitter Park.
30,"&gt; Just go sit in the park 

I agree with this. 

Not everyone may like the summer, but it's generally would be easier to sit outside for extended periods now than when it's 32 degrees outside."
31,This comment chain is *way* funnier than it probably should be.
32,The BBQ here sucks.
33,Have you tried the Times Square Applebee’s?
34,"I mean thats A LOT of places. But if it were me...

I would say Via Carotta or Extra Virgin. Even something in Battery Park City like PJ Clarkes or the restaurant at Le District and sit in the harbor."
35,"Oh a California transplant bitching about Mexican and Vietnamese, this is utterly shocking. Personally I think our largest ethnic cuisine failing is Ethiopian, we’ve got a couple spots, but they need to step their game up."
36,"Definitely cheap TexMex.  Fancy overpriced tacos abound and there's good authentic food from different Latin American countries, but whenever I go to California or Texas I have to hit up your basic Chili's/Chevys/Del Taco/Ixtapa kind of place for proper TexMex."
37,"Strongly suggest that you try volunteering. New York Cares coordinates hundreds of volunteer projects

https://www.newyorkcares.org/"
38,What it actually costs to line on your own. There are a ton of living costs that they've been absorbing that are invisible to you.
39,"Brooklyn Nanny here! I would really consider just putting him in a sling carrier - diaper, onesie or tiny t-shirt, sunhat. You can use an umbrella for extra sun protection if you think that might be helpful.

I really, really don't imagine your baby will overheat. Dress lightly yourself, as you'll be the one getting the workout! Also, when you get to your destination/as you're traveling, breastfeed/bottle feed your baby as often as he'll take it. Staying hydrated (for both of you!) will be the most important thing.

I would personally not recommend taking a long cab ride. Your baby is so young so will hopefully just nap the majority of the ride, however, I can say from personal experience - the babies I've nannied LOVE letting the scream-cries rip in cabs. It's humiliating. 

Ideal mode of transportation in my opinion is subway with a sling carrier. Even if it's a bit of a walk to get there, nothing's better - possible air conditioning, ability to stand and bounce your baby, chance of baby sleeping is best, etc.

Hope this might be helpful!"
40,The big thing for me was they let you go wherever tf you wanted for lunch. That's unheard of in many schools.
41,"You're sort of comparing apples to oranges here. 

* There are appetizing stores that sell dairy products and smoked fishes. Barney Greengrass and Russ and Daughters are appetizing stores. They might have meat on the menu at their downtown location (I think their uptown sells dairy only). But that would be why the meat sandwhichs aren't as great there. Its not what makes them famous.
* There are delis that are meat kosher (follow the kosher dietary laws). Fine and Shapiro and 2nd Ave are both kosher. This is much more traditional, in my opinion. But they will not mix meat and dairy (one of the laws) and so, you can get a pastrami but not a reuben. 
* There are delis that are meat kosher-style or ""jewish-style"" that sell unkosher things. Katz's is kosher style. It has everything a kosher place would have plus they mix meat and dairy (they sell reubens). They started kosher, but probably changed years ago to reach a wider customer base. 

Glad you're enjoying our food, you found good places already."
42,"Everyone seems to already have you covered with most of the stuff, but one thing I would bring up is the ability to travel almost anywhere and the diversity. 

For just $2.75 you can get into the subway system and have access to all of Manhattan, most of Queens, and the rest of the other boroughs. And then you can use the free transfer to a bus to get to the rest of anywhere. 

The diversity is unparalleled. You will find someone of almost every race and culture here, especially in Queens. Everywhere is it's own little bubble of culture, from Flushing to Jamaica to Forest Hills to Astoria all of Manhattan and everywhere else in between.

Also food. Don't get me started on the food choices.

""What's New York's specialty?""
""Everything.""

(And Pizza)"
43,"* Stock up on household and kitchen items
* Get some plants
* Do something clean up related everyday, even if it's just wiping a kitchen counter or 5 mins of using a broom/vacuuming"
44,"Overnight manager for a major retailer in Manhattan.  It takes getting used to but the pay is fantastic.  The most important thing I learned really quick is to have a set sleeping schedule, I work from 10pm-8am and sleep from 12-8 and have been perfectly fine for the last 6 years."
45,"Everyone has to eat. Makes them an easy default. Especially after work at dinner time. And restaurants are easier to talk to people than specific activities where you are more focused on the activity.


But if you want to do something else, do you ever organize/invite people to do other things? ""Hey guys, want to go see Toy Story on Saturday""? ""Hey, wanna come over next Friday and play board games and order pizza?"" ""It's supposed to not be hot as balls on Sunday, we should have a picnic in the park"". 


Free/cheap shows, escape rooms, volunteer together, wander around, look up meetups, etc. Check the side bar/Google ""free/cheap things to do in NYC"" and then invite friends to do them."
46,Head to Central Park on a weekday if you can. I'm always amazed at the size of the park and that I'm almost always able to find a quiet spot. It's helped me a lot while living in my apartment with no view but brick walls.
47,Just assume your take home salary is like 20% lower than what it actually is when you budget everything and you'll be fine.
48,"I work on film sets and occasionally work overnight. Places have included the library at Bryant Park, Green-wood Cemetery, misc street corners, subway stations, bars, restaurants. Sometimes interesting characters come out, sometimes it's just quiet. In the instance of Green-wood Cemetery, it was stunning, but *freezing* cold, as it was wintertime and there was really no cover. Another interesting time was when we were filming at a diner on the LES on a Friday night and we were near a popular night spot, so it was particularly interesting to see all the people coming and going in various states of inebriation."
49,native american food
50,"The company I work for sends HR people to job fairs every year, this year they have had a huge turn out and are constantly running out of paper applications. Some are 100% legit and we do hire people from them."
51,"Broker here, I would live at home till winter months when apts are less money and find a roommate or 2. you should be able to get something decent for 1400-1700 a month PP"
52,That’s what we do in NYC.  We meet up for food and drinks.
53,Pick better restaurants.
54,"And for completeness' sake:

* Bronx: Van Cortland Park
* Queens: Flushing Meadows
* Staten Island: Richmandtown/Latourette Park"
55,"I always just tell people that NY doesn't want you to live here.  Once you accept that the basics (grocery shopping, commuting) are a bit of an uphill climb I feel like you can start to enjoy the ""perks"".

&amp;#x200B;

* Always [check the subway schedule changes](http://web.mta.info/weekender.html) on the weekend.
* Express v. Local trains: which one is where, where they do and don't stop.
* People aren't usually rude they're just in a hurry-- it's sort of like being a waitress; if you apologized every time you bumped into one of your own you'd never stop apologizing.  Just don't be a dick and no one is going to be mad you bumped them getting onto the train.
* I still don't get it but apparently it's ON line not IN line.
* Also, MAJOR upvote for never get on a mysteriously empty subway car."
56,"In all honesty, thank you for your service. I get pretty tired of how much love the troops and troops adjacent public workers get when you guys, in my opinion, provide a service 1,000x more valuable."
57,"Dry heat &gt; Humidity 100% of the time, every time, now until forever."
58,"I used to live in Tucson. Major difference is NYC is a wet heat, especially underground in the subway is awful. In Tucson u were in a car so much that it didnt really matter. In NY u are outside or underground all the time."
59,"The main difference in terms of heat in NYC (or any urban area, really) is the fact that you’re outside far more than you are in suburban areas. 

For instance, if you wanted to go to the store in AZ you’d leave your air conditioned home, walk to your air conditioned car, drive to an air conditioned shop, and back again. Total time spent in the heat? Like a minute or two tops, depending on where you parked. 

Whereas in New York, you’re leaving your home (which may or may not have A/C, and if it does it’s anyone’s guess how well it works), walk [x] amount of minutes to the store / subway, then return. A 20 minute round trip to get something from the bodega isn’t really that bad, but in 85°F heat at 50–65% relative humidity? Be prepared to feel like you need to shower like 5 times a day."
60,Made it to where?
61,"- Make friends with natives. Other transplants and daytime transients cause the most drama.

- Keep a wallet sized map of the MTA with you. Also the MTA Trip Planner app is the most accurate.

- Always be sugary sweet to doormen and supers, and tip well at Christmas.

- Uber and Lyft have destroyed the yellow cab industry, so the cab drivers are cranky about it. Probably still won’t take you to Queens though.

- Catch happy hours, Pulsd and Groupon deals, and sign up for the Skint emails.

- Order directly from restaurant websites instead of Seamless and you’ll save a few bucks.

- Weed isn’t quite 100% but be cool and you’ll be fine.

- Join the other NYC subreddits and whatever neighborhood you’re moving to.

- That homeless guy on the corner makes more per hour than you."
62,"It's a ""chute"". I highly recommend a game called Chutes and Ladders. 


Do you have a super or maintenance? Have you tried talking to them? You are also entitled to an exterminator once a month, is there a sign up sheet for that?


Keep calling 311."
63,"Lift with your knees, not with your back."
64,"Dude, if you are visiting Times Square you have to get authentic NY food!

...

Sabaro is right around the corner!"
65,I think the main thing to keep in mind is that ZIP codes are not shapes- they're postal routes and so there's no reason they can't cross or intersect.
66,"Chez Moi in Brooklyn. You’ll have a hard time finding cheap French food, but this option is much more affordable than many other spots in Manhattan."
67,"Everything is more expensive, which is something you get over and learn to live with. There's always something happening, so it's easy to feel like you're missing out at times because you're literally always missing out on something. A lot of NYC life is about work, people spend a lot of time at work (too much) and it's what a lot of people talk about when getting to know someone...this is easy to get caught up in but I try to actively focus less energy on thinking/talking about work when I'm not there. One of the best parts of living in the city is leaving the city, so don't hesitate to explore to upstate NY, NJ, Long Island, CT!"
68,Yep. Our apartments are too small and shitty so we meet in restaurants or bars or the park.
69,"Umm, this isn't New York specific, but you basically [need a work visa from the US State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/temporary-worker-visas.html).  Employers generally will not hire you without one; it's illegal.  You might get a US company to sponsor a visa application, but you basically have to be someone with relatively rare skills."
70,"I’m almost 21 now, so looking back is still pretty fresh for me. In short, growing up in NYC is the best. A large part of my identity and my character is based on the thousands of lessons, experiences and random moments I’ve experienced while growing up in Brooklyn. 

New York is a trendsetting City, and I’m not just talking about fashion. In terms of culture, we are always at the forefront. I’m wrapping up my senior year of college at SUNY Albany and I must say, compared to nyc, Albany is years behind. From little things like the songs they play on their local radio to the way Albany locals are dressed, it’s a very distinguishable difference. 

Subways aren’t clean or as nice as they seem in movies/tv but hundreds of hilarious, insightful and random moments have occurred on the many train rides I’ve taken. You’ll get used to it pretty quick just don’t stare at anyone for too long (we mind our business around here and can take staring as a threat). Oh and heads up there’s always delays caused by people jumping in front of trains, construction, and other random shit so be sure to check your local transit news before boarding. 

You seem like a curious introvert and the city will force you to open up a bit and experience life more holistically. The many amazing museums, landmarks and art scenes are perfect for exploring the depths of your mind. Even sitting down on a soho stoop eating ice cream can inspire you in ways you haven’t thought of before. 

In conclusion, growing up in NYC has been a gift I’ve never really said “thank you” for. No wonder it’s getting gentrified as fuck by the second. Can’t blame them, I’d want to be from here too. Hope you enjoy this wondrous city and enjoy coming of age here. 

(Sounds like a great college-admissions essay in the making 😉)"
71,"I disagree.  If he moves to the city, he can ditch the car.  He'll save 10% of his income by doing this, plus the cost of a train pass.  This won't completely offset rent, but it'll go a long way, and he'll actually be able to enjoy his early 20s instead of spending 15+ hours a week commuting, and being to tired to go out on Friday nights."
72,"Call 311, say ""file a complaint against landlord."" I believe, because it's not IN your apartment, you can do this anonymously. Tell them there is a garbage pile up on your floor. The owners will be fined after an inspector comes. This may get them to actually care. And yes, if you think the Airbnb person is the one making the garbage (or the people he is renting to are), report him also - I am not sure where you would do this. In cases where you see negligence already, I think going straight where it hurts would work the best."
73,Oof. That username.
74,"Paramedic.

100% every bit of what this guy said."
