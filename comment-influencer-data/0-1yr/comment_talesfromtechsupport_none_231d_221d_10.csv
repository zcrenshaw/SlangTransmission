"I have a cute little thing I say to people in these circumstances: ""I didn't know either, until I found out"".

Don't ever mention when you found out."
"I hope this isn't too advanced for them, but hopefully they'll get to be able to understand this:

https://xkcd.com/627/"
"Oh, I see. It's a fairy tale. "
"As part of my hiring process, I was asked to describe a technical term as if I was talking to a 5-year old. This is probably the most applicable part of the interview process of a skill I use near daily in this job.

Fudge the words, obfuscate the meaning, but make sure he understands what's going on. You're not talking to a peer."
"And by 'all my stuff on the desktop', they mean the 40 useless widgets they discontinued in 7. I had one woman demand I change it back because she couldn't have a 1/4"" analog clock widget on her desktop with 10."
"Users never read the email. They'll skim the ever living hell out of it and gleam what they think it might possibly consider meaning, but they'll never read it."
If only you could get phones that came with some sort of *tether* that stopped the headsets getting separated from their base stations.
You had a legitimate lawsuit at the time for unjust firing.
"You solved it right away, just didn’t have the specifics yet.  It was totally a PEBKAC error and nothing on your side.  Gotta love narcissistic end users."
"&gt;[I work in IT](https://i.imgur.com/8KTtscB.jpg)

For someone *working in IT*, he seems terribly incompetent. Would explain why he can't afford a new router."
"record it, put it up on youtube. 

We'll make it viral. "
That really sucks friend. 
"as someone who works in IT... &lt;smirk&gt;...

If I had a router that was 13 years old, I would bin it (well, recycle it responsibly) and buy something shiny and new :) (and faster)

&amp;#x200B;"
"Im not one to recommend suing a former employer, but you legitimately had a case here.  You did as you were instructed.  The only person who should be fired is the person weho sent you the request to remove drive 3"
"It's an absolutely vital skill - at minimum, you should be able to pitch an idea at 3 levels - peer, tech but not your area, and tech management. That'll let you come up with a plan, get it funded, and explain the implementation to networks / storage / security. 

Adding levels ""completely non-technical but interested"", ""completely non-technical and doesn't care"", ""possible brain damage victim"" and ""Project Manager"" helps too. 

"
"well, I mean, you make the distance between the connections shorter so the data flows faster, right?
/s"
"Users do read.  The problem is that *stop* reading when the encounter the first punctuation mark.  Anything beyond the first period, common, hyphen, etc. is truncated.

Make sure anything you *really* want them to know precedes the first punctuation mark."
"Our sales team made a Photoshop of my eyes peeking over a banner that says ""We do support in our sleep - can your print MIS support do that?"" and posted it to her linkedin page with my story."
"Ah a nice relaxant XKCD always warms the heart.


I wish I was exaggerating but their MO seems to default to:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Ask MissAcedia for help or give up"
I see you too have developed a list of weasel words. 
"I heard a similar story earlier today, and I had a thought: I wonder if it would be worth spray painting some of my old floppy disks and selling them on etsy as 3D models of the Save icon. "
We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!
"If you say yes, the manager will stay out of your way and help you get it done as fast as possible."
"Sorry, the only thing I read was ""Users do read"" and then I just kinda zoned out..."
"[Here you go](https://imgur.com/a/xFyrFhs?)

&amp;#x200B;

The original was another Photoshop, one of my team made a series that was going to be a calendar of our crew - I was ""King of implementation""  in full robes and brass knuckles that said ""implementation"""
"&gt; We stricktly support Xml/Json/soap/php requests only, and only through email

At first I thought you mean you run the API over email..."
"The ""training"" exercise is savage. Love it!"
Days like these are my favorite. I always imagine I'm scaring the technology into compliance. *Glares at printer.*
So he gave you the CEO without telling you who it was? Sounds like sabotage.
"As the fiancee of an Etsy shop owner I think its a great idea. You can even offer engravings, can make necklaces out of them. Cheesy lines like ""She Saved Me""

Let me know you need supplies!"
"Might also be that his ""I work in IT"" is horseshit.
I know plenty of people who work ""in tech"" and don't know fuck all. "
I've had to jerry rig windows 7 sticky notes to work exactly the same way on windows 10 because that was how she managed her life and she 'could not even right now'
Hey I stopped paying rent on this house over 6 months ago and someone’s bulldozed it and built another house on top. I want you to go in the old house and get some photos of my dog for me..
"And then everybody clapped! /s

&amp;#x200B;

lol"
"Since you're now IT *whether you want to be or not* there's lessons to be learned.

* Document, document, document. Make a document with how to work that stuff on it. How it should be cabled.
* Put things in terms of money. ""Is it worth not fiddling with music every day? How much is it worth? $50? $100?""
* Plan for your succession. Literally, ask management what they would do with the tech gear if you got hit by a bus.

Enjoy! Welcome to IT, even if you don't plan to stay long. (I have a degree in Graphic Communications, but more the 'take your design and mass produce it' aspect. Been working in IT since 98 or so.)"
Life would be better if you could force users to answer a simple quiz at the end of an email before they could close out of it.
Then they will come thank you because their computer is much faster now.
"Ticket #666
Priority: Ultimate
I can't close my email!"
I have clients who worked in IT back in the 80’s and 90’s it is hard to break it to them that literally everything has changed since then
"I think the problem was pointed out as ""Little did I know,"".

If it is not routine, if it is not in a checklist, or if it involves doing something different: get confirmation and clearance from a superior who knows the client, understands the ramifications, and makes sure the company's compliance is contractually protected ."
"So essentially the pilot actually performed an attack run on a transformer with a live 500lb bomb. 

Motherfucker what"
"Funny enough, the bomb didn't explode after it impacted through the transformer and the tin shack. No, they had to get EOD on the scene that following weekend to do controlled detonations because bomb number 2 also embedded itself in the ground below the tin shack it had obliterated after trashing a transformer.  


That final sentence was fun to write."
"&gt; $K: But isn't Liechtenstein part of Austria?

I think Austria is aware that Anschluss is a very bad idea."
I guess that dummy bomb was pretty loaded.
"I didn't come here for the feelings! I don't know what to do with them!  


Am I the monster, or are you the monster for making me feel?"
Whoever could invent such a thing would be a millionaire overnight!
"&gt;&lt;Closes ticket without asking.&gt;

You know that you're not meant to but you just ~~want~~ have to."
