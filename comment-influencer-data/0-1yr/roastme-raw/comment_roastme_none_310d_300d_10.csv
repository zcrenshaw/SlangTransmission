I really wasn't going to post at first, but... I figured you all really deserved a good roast and i had a shit-ton of fun with this. You all made me laugh and i truly am touched by your kind words and best wishes. 

I see it like this.. If I'm meant to live, i will. If I'm not... Well, i got to experience one hell of a roller coaster that is life and all the adventures I've been on will always live on in the memories of those i was with. I lived as best as i could and sometimes not so much, but i always tried to do good and to make the best of what i was given. 

If i could give any words of wisdom, they would be this:

Just live. Enjoy everything that you can and everyone who comes into your life. Don't worry about what might happen and don't worry about those things you can't control. The universe will always provide exactly what you need; even if it's something that you THINK that you didn't need or want at the time. Just know that everything happens as it's supposed to and if you believe that, you'll be able to enjoy all the things life has in store for you. 

I love you all. "
