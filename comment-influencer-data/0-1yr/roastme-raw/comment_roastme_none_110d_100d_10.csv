The only chesting you experience is sorting through your chest of dildos

"Damn. I won't say anything mean, your gene pool has already done you enough of a disservice."
The face you make when mocking what someone else said because you couldn’t come up with a comeback
We are going to see this on /r/blunderyears in the distant future. Very distant.
