0,"Wow you came so close to seeing what life is like from her perspective. Can you imagine not feeling anything below the waist?  Count your blessings, man "
1,Your girlfriends making you do this? What do you even need a back brace for if you’re spineless? 
2,At least your girlfriend was kind enough to hold the “roast me” sign for you. 
3,The true story: Broke Back Mountain. 
4,Is your fiancé a LOTR fan? Because the only reason a guy would put a ring on that mess is the hope it’d make you invisible 
5,Thank god for him. He's taking one for the team. 
6,"If your girlfriend told you to jump off a cliff, would you?"
7,"Cheer up, you know an engaged man with a lot more reason to be sad than you."
8,"Came for the roast, witnessed the murder"
9,"This roast hurt. Alexa, play despacito"
10,Enjoy the opiate addiction! Hopefully you don’t rebreak your back when you hit rock bottom.
11,If Ellen DeGeneres was on testosterone and speed
12,Anymore foundation and you’ll need a building permit.
13,No point in shooting up a school. Everyone already died laughing at you. 
14,On a scale of 1-10 how devastated is your gf that you survived?
15,Are you sponsored by sharpie??
16,That's no lesbian that's my ex boyfriend
17,"I like how you attempted to crop your forehead out of the photo but it still wasn’t nearly enough. 

Edit: Holy shit; thanks everyone!"

25,"Look at the bright side, at least now your back matches your childhood, your bank account, and your relationship. "
26,"Redyed my ass, you used a shitty felt pen to hide your receding hairline. "
27,You can see where the balls have smacked your chin so much they worn down your beard 
28,"your ring says engaged, your cleavage says ""I'm down to fuck for 15 bucks and a pack of smokes"""
29,Watching kids play at the park doesn’t count as working. No matter how much you’re sweating. 
30,"You’ll never be the same. You’re 17 and can’t understand this right now, but every single day for the rest of your life, you will be affected by this. Every time you hike your back will hurt. Every time you want to wakeboard, the nerve pain around the injury will keep you from enjoying it. Arching your back to ride a bike will be excruciating. When you have kids and want to swing them around in the air, you’ll have intensely painful muscle spasms and have to put them down instead. You can turn to drugs, but ibuprofen won’t cut it and you’ll probably end up on prescription narcotics. Good luck not getting addicted. Your life potential is now less than what it could have been, and there is literally nothing you can do about it, all because of one stupid moment at 17. 

Just kidding you’ll probably be fine. "

But little does everyone know that you are actually trying to do that just because it's the only moment you'll ever get to hear your friends laugh around you instead of behind your back as usual. It's as if you need that laugh because you've now become self aware of how basic your personality is. Because of this sense of self awareness you've become stressed as days just blends together and every morning you wake in the mirror your eyes start to resemble those of a basset hound. That's good you're changing things up by going to a community college but then again it could be for another generic job that all your friends talk about because you've never had a single original thought.
