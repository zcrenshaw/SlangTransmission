Now since he isn't around to play with those nipples in two postcodes you came along hoping to scavenge some extra attention and aptly titled it as ""fuck it II"". I suppose one can read it as ""second hand fuck"". Second hand is way to conservative, for who's to say how many hands, dicks and tongues that has seen?

Yet you love ""the"" young people..

You had your day back then, but you couldn't handle the shit that hit you. You ran away, cried in shower and hid under your bed. Once you saw the worthless Reddit gold you came with a bikini to say you're OK.

245,"I saw ""II"" in your post so I had to go look it up, which meant looking at your post history. So roasting aside, I'm going to be honest here.

There are a lot of people here who insult and get insulted all in good fun, but you and those like you who do it in order to get attention, to stay in focus, are honestly the lowest rung of the internet social strata. You must be in the spotlight, you feel any small amount of attention brings you validation and confirms to yourself that you have a role in the world.

Unfortunately that isn't the case, nobody cares outside of the moment. Internet attention is fleeting, it burns through content at a rapid pace. If your contributions are topical and inane, limited to a few artless pictures and medeocre comments then you are little more than the intrest of the hour, if that.

Look at your history, you've already tried the cute animal route, a route already saturated with content. You've tried the softcore porn route, another route that churns out hourly content, and slobbered over by sexless neckbreards because it is the closest they will come to actual fucking. Is this the following you want? Are these the people that make you feel like you have a place in this world?

Judging by your history and attention grasping nature, if you continue unchanged I predict you will be doing anal on cam in a year, not for tips, just to feel like someone cares."
