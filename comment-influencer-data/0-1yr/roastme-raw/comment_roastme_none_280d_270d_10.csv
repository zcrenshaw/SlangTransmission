216,"This is what to expect. You'll meet a boy who is nice to you. He'll buy you gifts and treat you well. You'll fall in love and offer every part of you mind body and soul to the relationship. A few months in you'll notice he's acting a bit distant and you'll start trying things to make him come back to you. Your sex life will start to disappear, so you'll start buying lingerie and toys, anything to reignite his passion for you. He'll briefly become a little interested so you'll start degrading yourself sexually just so he expresses any feelings toward you. 
One day you'll be dressed like a whore, with a toy shoved up your arse while he fucks you and calls you a pig and you'll realise that the only way you'll keep your man is to completely negate your self respect. You'll cry when he's left that night, because you know your efforts won't make him love you like you love him. The depression will set in and eventually he'll leave you. You'll have a few one night stands that are as degrading as your relationship. Maybe even a lesbian stint to try and justify your existence, but at the end of the day your sum and complete worth to this world is being a wet and willing hole to someone who may love you for it.

Which lesson of your mothers imprinted on you more, how to not be able to say no, or not being able to display love in a healthy manner? Because when you empathize with a person who talks about being a slut, [you say you too used to be a person who sought out relationships to fill an emotional void](https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/9vw5ol/relationships_qnd_depression/e9lnfvt) and when you you factor in the fact that you used to be fat, one can't help but wonder how you reacted when, as a skinny teen, you started getting genuine interest from the opposite sex, especially given the fact that you consider yourself [introverted and unhappy](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9yru3x/is_anyone_an_extreme_introvert_and_happy/ea56q3f)

And does that answer help shine some light as to why, at 17, you already [know the way men like their blowjobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9mc24g/hi_i_need_help/e7dldnz)?
