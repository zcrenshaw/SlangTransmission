"Q: What's the difference between a doctor and God?

A: God doesn't think he's a doctor."
"Did the 25B thing myself awhile back.
We had a warrant officer repeatedly fat finger his password over the course of several days and blame us.
(He also kept monkeyfisting the ventrilo settings, but that's another tale)

At his final blustering at help desk I look over at our LTC and my Sergeant and say to the officer,  ""I'll reset your password one more time. Here is your new password, enter it EXACTLY as you see it.""

His new password ""*ReP3aT0Ff3nDeR$""

He quit fat fingering his password."
"Oh no, you've cursed yourself by saying that's the story you're leaving on.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't wait to hear what you've got for us on Monday! ;)"
"Yeah I work at a university and most of my colleagues refer to the entire tower of a desktop computer as the ""CPU,"" even the millennials"
This is where you simply play back the recording of the previous call where he explicitly tells you to turn it off.
Copying logon.wav and logoff.wav to your desktop in an attempt to deceive the tech support on the phone into thinking that you actually rebooted your machine is something fucking powerful
"Important troubleshooting rule: never trust anything that you didn't do yourself.

Corollary: The you of today is a different person than the you of six weeks ago.  Don't trust that bastard either."
We had all placed our bets on how long we thought it would be until he calls in due to lost work. One of those users that always has loads of documents open never closes once done never reboots his machine so it was only a matter of time.
"Best thing to say in this instance is ""aaah shucks in that case I'll take the Laptop and you can go back to Apple and buy a new one.""

Sorry about that"
Are you SURE that it's plugged in?
"If you had left the company in the meantime: ""Hey, can you believe that some bloke 10 years ago tried to install a service pack on these servers?"""
He's pretending everyone is a dog.
This hurts my brain and reminds me of several conversation I've had around WiFi including the one from Wednesday wherein a guy thought he would get free WiFi by buying a Google router. Long conversation to explain what an ISP and modern are
"That's how most non-technical people are trained on the components of a computer, I've seen countless examples. Monitor, keyboard, mouse, and CPU (or ""hard drive"")."
"If it was caused by a customer, at least they went to self check out and not a cashier"
At least they did not use $Cleverwordplayonnetscape
"I sorta remember back last century.  I worked for a company that had a beautiful server visualization thing.  All our servers were displayed as icons with the connections between them.  If there were warnings, the server icon would change from green to yellow, and if there were errors, they would turn red (I'm oversimplifying, but you get the idea).  We trained a team to monitor our servers on off hours.  We spent months writing documenting what to do in general and what to do when certain servers started to throw errors.  We spent around two weeks training this team.

&amp;#x200B;

A while after everything had been in place, one of our sysadmins was in the room with them and he sees one of our servers turn orange.  He decided to use this a chance to make sure they're doing what their supposed to.  Instead of following the written training, some guy on the team right clicked on the server and selected the ""Clear Messages"" option, turning the server green again.  He was really proud of himself for fixing the server .... My buddy, on the other hand, was ready to kill."
"Older factories: Fix problem yourself.  

Not so old factories: Maintenance guy fixes problem.  

Modern factories: Call somebody who may not even be in the same country to fix a problem."
"Yes. This week.

I work for a DoD organization and we've been pushing out a new Win10 image that has *massively* caused inconveniences across the organization, and one in particular stood out:

Me: ""How may I help you?""

Customer: ""I need assistance setting up my laptop after the uh... new Win ten image?""

Me: ""Okay sir, just let me know what-""

Customer: ""Can you just remote in?""

Me: ""... to do what sir?""

Customer, in irritated voice: ""To log me on,""

Me: ""Sir, what is preventing you from logging on?""

Customer: ""It doesn't recognize my CAC so I need you to get me in.""

Side note: Common Access Cards, and admin tokens, are all bound to one user. I cannot use *my* CAC to get Mr. Grumpy into *his* account, and when I inform him of as much, he raises his voice, tells me to shut up, and then demands to speak with my manager... who then informs him that everything I said was true.

Mr. Grumpy then left me an unsatisfied customer service mark, but since calls are recorded, his lovely tirade is now one of our ""Customer gone berserk"" templates. Fun stuff."
Do not under any circumstances allow end users to reopen tickets. This would be a new ticket with its own metrics.
"&gt;Doctors are GODS and can do no wrong (well, not really but you get my point).

Malpractice insurers would argue this."
"Easy solution, really. Muffin' to it."
"You want to get on a Doctor’s bad side or generally piss them off tell them the are meat mechanic and only subpar at that as they couldn’t even get into Veterinary School.  

Source I used to work at a large Medical school and teaching hospital.  

For those that might be wondering Veterinarian School is MUCH harder to get into than Medical School."
"I think what confused her is that both options sound reasonable. She wants to do both things - do not run it, and disinfect the file, but she can only click one of them."
It's interesting how some people can funnel information from their eyes to their mouth without it touching the brain.
"Really? Even before I entered the tech field, in both civilian and Army side, I'd rarely, if ever, heard of anything other than the actual part referred to as the CPU"
"yeah, if someone was angry enough to completely toast the aluminium steel frame it may have ended in an arrest and some charges."
"But then they bank might notice the document that says ""yeah I know it's Unix. The bank CIO is a fucking moron"""
"I would have clicked at the beginning of the text, hit shift-ctrl-home, and then the delete key."
I'm actually kinda impress to be honest with you
He would get free WiFi with a router! Just not internet access ;)
"I told a doctor I needed to reset his password today because he couldn't log in and his current password clearly wasn't working, and his response was ""No, that won't work for me."""
The average user doesn't even read errors in pop up windows. None of them are going to read a ReadMe file.
"It's worse than that.  20-30 years ago, the box with all the important bits (what techy folk would call 'the computer') would be labelled as 'the hard drive' or 'the CPU' in any textbooks of the beginning-to-use-new-office-software sort for office workers.  When I bought my first new computer and needed to move some stuff over, I actually sat my mom down at the kitchen table to explain what the parts were inside, so she could understand why I wouldn't let her call the tower 'the CPU'.  I used the old one for a demo unit, and actually had her physically handle some of the parts (the ones I wasn't transferring to the new machine).  She got it immediately, and from then on tried to use the right words.. but you can't really do that for people without having a demo unit to take apart, and people are rightfully leery of having the non-techy masses handle delicate electronic equipment."
It’s like the police chief who’s one day till retirement
I would've left a readme or something.
First for me.
"I suggest a congratulatory email on the “completely successful unplanned unplanned downtime recovery test”. 

Everyone will get distracted by “unplanned unplanned” and forget about the actual outage."
"That's a good burn, love reading about backlash from the tech support employees."
"Can confirm. One of my favorite surgeons couldn't get into vet school, so became a doctor. He actually has one of the best bedside manners of any of our surgeons."
"Even more modern:  Call the wrong person and leave a message.  Loudly complain that right person doesn't fix it.

Extra modern: Loudly complain the right person didn't realize you sent a message to the wrong person and fix _that_ too."
The thing to do here is never help him with his computer again. He will 100% ask for it at some point. Just remind him that he promised not to ask for your help again.
"I always thought that helpdesk people were morons or thought I was to ask me if it’s plugged in. Like how dumb does someone have to be? Apparently many many people are, in fact, that dumb."
"I'd be really tempted to just save a copy of the draft email of ""Per my attached request, User is no longer with this company and their email needs to be deleted"" with the original request attached. Open it up, address it, and send every couple of days."
"what the brother would hear... "" aaah shucks in that case I'll take the Laptop and ~~you can~~ go ~~back~~ to Apple and buy *you* a new one."""
"Had this same type of conversation a whole bunch of times

user - ""I can't do X""

me - ""Good"""
Couldn't the screws be ordered online as well if he really really wanted them?
Rule of What's to Come: All problems are future You's problems. Try to make his job as easy as possible.
But imagine all the words he could process or sheets he could spread!
"We had to implement a Muted Close status into RT about 24 hours after first setting it up.

"This is a great story as the user at least tried, legit maximum points for effort."
understandable. fists are nature's reboot switches.
"&gt;Caller: But the laptops are supposed to have build in WiFI!! 

They do have the ability to connect to the Internet using WIFI.  You still need a WIFI signal to connect with.

Considering you're accessing patient data, you should only connect  through a secure WIFI hotspot from your company issued phone.  I'll pass this on to your Supervisor or Manager so it can be communicated to all their front-line staff.

Thank you for calling, and bringing this important issue to light."
"This annoyed me a bit. You start off by saying, ""relatively few of them are particularly tech savvy,"" but then proceed to laugh at them for your insistence on them using your ""desktop"" terminology even though it doesn't sit on a desk.  She heard ""desktop"" and was imagining the top of her desk, which is perfectly reasonable. This does happen a lot, especially if they're not really computer people.

Perhaps I'm too long in the tooth, but I think the customer service direction to take here would be to ask better questions, such as ""Is it a laptop?"", ""Is it a box that's on the desk or on the floor?""

The moment you found out it was an Optiplex, trying to have them change their language did nothing at all.

Maybe they should be tech savvy, sure, but they're not, and they are your customers, so it's your job to help them, not belittle them, especially behind their back."
I can't remember now but we all knew it was going to happen
I do think that any website that must be accessed with a particular browser is a WTF.
"At once workplace, we used to joke amongst ourselves about going postal - obviously within a circle of people who understood we were letting off steam and no one was in harms’ way. This was also a long time ago. The US is a different place now. 

But one coworker, a future lawyer, used to joke that if any of us was going to actually go postal, not to tell him about it, he didn’t want to be an accessory. Just call him up and tell him “today’s a bad day to go to work.” He’d know what we weren’t saying, he’d call in “sick,” he’d survive."
"Tell him you can activate a new feature that will prevent this, persistent record.... And trun back on autosave."
I'm all four.
"IT checklist:

1. Is it plugged in?
2. Is it turned on?
3. Are you sure?
4. Did you check?"
