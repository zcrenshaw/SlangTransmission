Shower sex.
"I check out girls and guys, but the thought of having anything sexual with a guy, no matter how attractive he is, is repellent to me. I can appreciate a beautiful man, but i cant be aroused by one. Thats proof enough for me that i'm straight."
"I just think, ""Nice."" It doesn't really set off a big chain of thoughts in my head."

Nice.
I always forget everyone on here is 14. 
"I had a spider bro chilling in my kitchen window for months. He’d have piles of dead flies under his web because he’d kill them faster than he could eat. One day, I was vacuuming up his body pile and I accidentally vacuumed up spider bro too. Felt like such a jackass.

Another one moved into his spot, but he isn’t as effective."
Only back when I was playing CoD.
"I really like to give blowjobs, they are fun to give, but I don't like swallowing cum.

Like I'd still do it if the guy cum doesn't taste bad because dudes find it hot when you swallow but I definitely get why some prefer to spit the cum, porn make it looks like it's not a big deal to taste cum, it can honestly be a true mood killer if the guy is a smoker.

Seriously, we should put in on cigarette package : YOUR CUM WILL TASTE LIKE OLD TOBACCO IF YOU SMOKE. I'm sure it will be more effective than ""Smoking causes cancer"".

EDIT : To the people sending me stuff like "" uh this is askmen, not askwomen"", I'm a gay dude, and wtf is wrong with women posting here ?"
Beach sex.  Sand is no friend of sex.
Threesomes. You get one more sex partner but three times as many logistical concerns and chances for hurt feelings.
"The difference is between knowing you're great, and deciding everyone else needs to know you're great."
"I was at a low point in life after I lost my job and my car broke down. That summer a little red finch perched himself outside my window every morning and would sing. I called him Charles and He helped me get up in the morning and face the day. I would wake up, wish him a good morning, have a cup of coffee with him and then get about my day. About a month later I saw this little gal finch start showing up nearby when he would sing in the morning. Bro had moves. About a week later they stopped showing up. Get it Charles. Hope you had a good life

Edit: I'm glad you all enjoyed the story :) I never knew it was a story I had that I could share before. I figured I could share Charles a bit more with you. Presenting, Charles the finch.

"The “Pop Rocks”Blowjob.

Pretty much just a waste of Halloween candy and a normal blowjob.

"personally i’ll enjoy literally anything my fiancee does....


ONLY if she is clearly into it. I have to jedi mindtrick myself to orgasm when i receive oral from a face that just looks tired of it all. 

but when she’s lookin at my dick like it’s an ice cream sundae and moaning when she puts it in her mouth... that’s when i bust real quick. "
"My wife has been really harsh towards one of my friends lately.  I let her get away with it for a little bit because he was pissing me off too (being unreliable, not showing when committing, etc...), but at a certain point I had to remind her that he's my family and she wouldn't like it if I had talked about her family the way she was talking about him."
And maybe take another peak for a good measure.
"When I was in uni my housemate had a one night stand and sucked his dick. Was wasted and I had to hear it all through very very thin walls  

He came without warning in her mouth (big no no) and she panicked and what I remember from the yells was that she threw up and then sneezed and cum came out of her nose 

So much screaming and vomit..."
"Good ol' dream about cheating. It's impressive the amount of guys who go through this.

She ""accidentally"" woke me up in the middle of the night and, since I was awake, proceeded to yell at me because I cheated on her on her dream.

Look, I get it, it was one of those really realistic dreams. She was upset because she's had a nightmare. I *would* cuddle, I *would* comfort her, I *would* reassure her - if it wasn't for the fact that she was fighting with me over it.

I just turned over and went back to sleep."

"Mine is this fucking massive ass crab spider hanging on the outside of my window. I make sure to turn on the kitchen light at night and leave the curtains open to attract bugs to his web. He managed to sprawl his web across the entire window and is a fucking champion at it.

It just snowed and I see him all curled up in the corner of the window doing that hibernation thing spiders do. I hope he makes it.

Edit:

Here's a crappy phone photo before it snowed, I wish I took a better photo in hindsight.

"girls just seem to love hanging out with me on a platonic level. which is fine. but when im sat there eating lunch on a table surrounded by 4 girls every day, i feel like im that gay friend and everyone else sees it that way too.

"Facials in real life. Decidedly unsatisfying.

Much better to ejaculate **in** something: vagina, mouth, anus."
"Yup, washes away all the natural lube and ironically makes everything dry."
Anything with food. You end up sticky with a yeast infection
I think a better question is why have there been all these questions about sitting while pissing all of a sudden? Piss how you want. 
"Going to the gym is the best. Don’t sit at home, it will just inspire boredom and thus the desire to drink again. Go to the gym, do some cardio, lift some weights, come home feeling good and having killed a couple hours. Plus after a few weeks you’ll feel so good you won’t want to go back. "

"Great starting location, horrible location to try and get the job done."
"People have thought that im gay a few times. I just got off from a 7 year long relationship and told a local bartender about he breakup and he went ""huh, i always thought you were gay"". It really surprised me and a few other people have told that too.

I asked one of those people why they thought i'm gay and the response was something like ""Because you're so open and different from other people"". 

Well if that makes me gay so be it lol. But then again i live and in a small city within a small country. A bit old fashioned place one could say

Edit: Spelling"
We had a lizard on the porch named Francine. She was missing a tail. She ate the bugs on our porch and served as the gatekeeper to our home. My dog ate her. 
"Is this a Pixar short? It should be.

"My mum and I took in a baby hummingbird that was hopping hopelessly under our avocado tree. It seemed to have been injured trying to take flight so we nursed it back to health. This was around the time my pops was in the hospital so she named it Faith and I named it Mr. Rogers. We couldn’t pick a name so we compromised and named it Mr. Faith Rogers. 

Mr. Faith Rogers would fly right up to my face when I’d get home from work and would chill with my mum when she would knit or work out on the patio. The last day it flew right past us to say goodbye was the day my pops came home healthy and alive. Animals are great, man. *sigh* "
Sex for more than ~20 minutes.  Past that point it starts getting less and less fun.
Nice.
This is the secret to giving non-teenage men quick blowjob orgasms. I firmly believe this to be true.
"Crazy pornstar positions. If we or my partner has a hard time figuring it out, I usually go soft when we finally sorta of get it. There's a reason why Missionary is considered the gold standard. "
"I can relate. I will definitely comment when I think a man is attractive, but I have no sexual desires towards men. I knew I was straight very early on. As a young young boy, I had an infatuation with breasts and loved the attention of older women. Some people get weirded out if I mention a guy is attractive (father, older guys I’ve worked with, etc. ) I’m just really comfortable with my sexuality and mentioning a man is hot doesn’t make me feel weird. "
Ask men hates anal so much. Another oddity of this sub 
The trick is moving your eyes but not your neck. Women can hear neck muscles but eye muscles are too small for them.

"I think there is more to sex than just the orgasm. It's being close to someone. It's about sharing intimacy. I love having sex with my gf of 13 years. Yeah, we spend time doing other things, but that's because she is my best friend. "
This was arguably the greatest disappointment of my early twenties.
People actually do this shit? Damn. 
Get yourself a career and move out. It sounds like that place will eventually get the best of you. 
"I’ve been told “are you getting close or...?” and “I’m tired, are you almost done?”

It’s like **woah**. No, this is **totally over**. "
"I think when people say they’ve been having sex for hours, it encompasses more than just the actual act of intercourse.  It’s the foreplay, the sex, the cuddling, foreplay again, sex again, etc...  "
Just ask someone else to lick them for you
"Exactly. My ex would feel bad that a handjob wouldn't really do it for me. I just told her that my hand has over a decade of practice over hers, so that'd be a hard gap to close lol"
"&gt; So much screaming and vomit... 

Bout sums up my experiences in uni so far

&amp;#x200B;"
"Had a few dates with a guy in college.  When push came to shove, I could NOT get it up.  Knew then and there I was 100% straight.  Shame too, no girl ever treated me as well as that guy did."
"Best way to put it is if you make her uncomfortable from the get go, you already fucked up. I wish I could scream this at fellow dudes. It never ceases to amaze me how easily it is for guys to venture into making a woman they're interested in extremely uncomfortable and then continue to push the envelope. You should aim to make most social interactions comfortable for everyone in general and the same goes for when you shoot your shot. "
"I was always very extroverted and fearless around people, but for a long time during my teens I wasn't very good at being around people (i.e. poorly socialised) and often made them feel uncomfortable or annoyed. The effect was particularly bad around women. Eventually closer to 20, with help from friends who were courageous enough to be straight with me about my problems, I was able to realise that it would be best if I calmed down, paid more attention to what people say and really listen, let go of the outcome around women (i.e. not giving a fuck but also not being callous or aloof) and just act in such a way that people felt that I valued their time, opinions and presence without hoping to get anything from them. Rather than trying to impress people and prove myself, be the biggest personality in the room, and project my expectations and neediness onto other people.

As soon as these things were really ""baked in"" to my identity and social graces, my social and romantic life did dramatic 180's. Suddenly I wasn't the loud, arrogant but oblivious and awkward guy, I was the assertive, confident, relaxed, easy going guy who'd make time for anyone but wasn't at all shy. I think this is the ideal state to reach whether you are an introvert or an extrovert - the only difference should be how much time to yourself you need to recover after the party is over. After this change, I made friends who weren't just other misfits, I helped my misfit friends to be more comfortable and fit in better with more types of people, and I didn't betray any of my values in the process. Also it turns out that women especially really like it when you're that relaxed guy who's at home in his own skin but is happy to engage socially. It's the opposite of thirst, and it makes them want to make their time available whether as friends or romantic prospects.

I'm really glad I went through all that, because it made me a lot happier all round.

EDIT: This blew up very unexpectedly. It's a far larger story than what I've written with a great deal more context than is presented above. It's hard to distil one of the most critical turning points of your existence down into a digestible reddit comment. But I'm glad some of you enjoyed it."
"I was pretty socially awkward for high school and Freshman year of college.  I probably didn't start 'clicking' with other people until Sophomore year of College.  

So here are some big ones that I found helped me a lot.

-Don't be judgmental.  I've honestly found that 99% of the time, people who tend to be extremely judgmental of others are doing it out of their own insecurities.  To give an example of not being judgmental: let's say I'm hanging out with a friend of mine and he introduces me to another friend who dresses like J-Roc from ""Trailer Park Boys"".  Old me would have immediately thought that this guy is a moron/douchebag, and would have immediately closed off to him.  But if you're willing to be more open, you will find that people will surprise you.  Knowm sayin?

-Don't be a people-pleaser: This doesn't mean you shouldn't have tact or be rude, but there are people out there who you simply aren't going to be friends with, don't change your opinions to try and make them like you.  That doesn't mean you have to butt in and start arguments with them over everything, but it also means don't be a coward and hide yourself completely because you want them to like you.

-Know when to stop talking.  Nervous/socially awkward people have this really obvious habit of not knowing when to stop talking.  My sense is because they assume that the person they're with doesn't want to be with them unless they're a constant source of entertainment, so they can't stand silence and feel like they need to continuously talk and keep things moving.  The truth is you really don't have to, and it's blatantly obvious when you're just fishing for conversations.  Nowadays, my friends and I can hang out and watch the Football game and no one says a word for 30 minutes, and it's fine.

-Get hobbies and stay busy: This one is pretty obvious.  It's tough to talk to people when your entire life consists of working a boring job that you don't like to talk about, then you go home and play video games until you go to sleep.  You don't need to be James Bond, but get outside your comfort zone and find some interesting hobbies you enjoy.

-Practice makes perfect: No one magically just has confidence and immediately knows how to interact with others, you have to actually go out there and do it to get better at it.  Will there be occasional awkwardness and embarrassment?  Sure, but so what?  You're going to fall over a lot when you first start learning to ski, doesn't mean you won't get better.

A lot of this really just comes down to being confident in yourself and believing that you are a generally fun person to be around.  When this starts to click with you, you'll have an easier time being comfortable in social situations, talking to people at random, and making new friends."

My girl was running the shower as she was cleaning it one day, and said he came too far out of the window sill, and the water took him. 
I nearly cried. It was hard losing him, but even harder having to break up with her for it. (Lol jk).

She came over, saw the dishes she'd done still had shit on it, that started the fight."
"You'll know.

I think male attractiveness and female attractiveness is much different.

It's easy enough to know which women are more attractive than which other women; even though opinion and taste plays a role, there still seems to be a ""scale"" upon which there is vague agreement.

In men there seem to only be three categories:

1) Attractive enough for women to overlook bad things;
2) Unattractive enough for women to ignore good things;
3) The vast middle, where women will find you attractive or unattractive based on factors other than your looks."

"Could not agree with this more.  However, I'd like to suggest that folks make this one of *many* changes.

I tried to quit drinking several times and failed, even when I replaced drinking time with a different activity, like working out.  Was it good for me to work out?  Absolutely.  But I eventually realized that what I (personally) needed, was not simply to replace a particular habit with another one, but to *transform my mindset* -- the mindset that had driven me toward drinking in the first place.

Thus, not only did I start working out again, but I started listening to podcasts by Tim Ferris.  I started reading books like *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Steven R. Covey, *Principles* by Ray Dalio, *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie, etc.  I made a conscious effort to reshape my thought process and identity, and that made all the difference.

It doesn't take much, either.  If you start each day by reading or listening to things that are optimistic, empowering, and educational, it really does change the way you view life -- or at least, it did for me.  The experience was a *total* 180 from the mornings I'd had in the past, which were characterized by a hangover and a general disdain for everything and everyone around me.  Rather than wishing I could just stay in bed until it was time to drown my senses again, I felt like I wanted to grab the world by the fuckin' balls, and I did.

I dunno, maybe I'm a little extreme.  Admittedly, I've always been kind of ""all or nothing.""  But I'm not sure that I would've gotten to where I am today if I had let most things remain the same, while trying to jettison alcohol, which had, in a way, become my best friend up to that point.  I needed to see and feel a radically different way in order to make that change stick.

I would say good luck to anyone out there who's struggling, but luck has nothing to do with it.  Be strong, be vigilant, and feel free to PM me if you need to talk.  /r/stopdrinking is a great resource as well.

I started peeing sitting down a long time ago. Probably at age 24. I'm 32 now. Less splash and chance to miss. Makes keeping the toilet clean a lot much easier. I can also pee in the dark in the middle of the night if i need to.
One thing that’s not really overrated but I don’t do anymore is fuck my gf’s mouth while she hangs her head off the bed. It feels amazing but one time she had this mirror directly on the other side of where her head was hanging down and I made eye contact with her. Just felt wrong to do after that.
Nice.
"I started smoking.

After quitting that I started eating.

Now I'm in the gym trying to undo that. "
"Not between hetero/homo. But sometimes I feel like I’m dropping into the asexual side of the spectrum. I can recognize an attractive woman, but 90% of the time, I never want to even bother trying. I’d rather just be alone. Even if I find them physically attractive, mentally I’m checked out. But every once in a while I’ll meet someone where it’s clearly obvious there’s something more there. I have feelings for my friend right now and from the moment we started getting closer, there was no question I would be with her if I could. These experiences are very few and far between. The next time I feel this level of desire towards someone probably won’t be for years. I’ll just go back into not wanting to bother with anybody. And that’s why I’m a little curious if I may have some asexuality going on. The desire to have sex and be with someone is *so low* and infrequent."
"It goes through phases. Used to be that everyone on this sub was *all about* shoving things up their own asses, but I guess that group must be busy doing something else right now because I don't see that as much"
"It's all about having good communication, I made my feelings clear and she apologized and backed off.  On the plus side, he's also been a much better friend lately."

"If you are fine with pretending to be Christian the rest of your life with her, including your wedding, letting her raise your children (if you want any) in the church, etc. then lie about it. 

If you don’t want to do that, don’t lie. It will only cause problems down the line and you need to talk to your GF about all of this. "
That's how I feel every time I realize I'm much closer to 30 than I am 20 now.
"Lmao same. The bro’s before hoes comment and everyone telling him that she should just get over it. If I had a friend privately tell my girlfriend not to fuck me over, I’d question the friend or ask him to apologize. 

She’s acting immature by not talking about it fully, but she’s the one you’re dating and possibly spending your romantic future with, not him. Instead of talking about her in the comments of your reddit thread and clearly just taking your friends side go communicate to your girlfriend and figure out how you can both handle the situation differently to fit both of your needs. For fucks sake it’s that easy. Do this even just for practice for future relationships. This doesn’t need to be treated like high school drama. 

Bonus points for yourself, go talk to your friend and ask him not to say things like that to your significant other in the future. It clearly makes her upset. I’m a little conflicted on this part based on your other comments though. You just aren’t getting why what he said might have been immature or stupid and I don’t want to put words in your mouth. You might want to figure this part out on your own or just not bring it up and hope this conflict doesn’t happen again. 

My point is, go communicate with the people in your life instead of what you’re doing here. Good luck. "

"I had a Toadbro named Thomas who would always be in the exact same spot on the porch around 10pm every night, right under the light so he could eat up the bugs. My dog ate Thomas after 4 years of friendship. Could not look at my dog for a couple days. RIP. "
Fastest method is to whip your dick out as soon as you enter the bathroom and pee directly into the sink. Rinse it down afterwards. Saves water and time 
19 year old girls have a lot of feelings. Maybe in a few years she won't sweat the small stuff anymore.
"Sometimes there's a cynical part of me that thinks this kind of question is asked hoping to get a response of ""I immediately objectify her, undress her with my eyes while ignoring all of the diplomas on her wall, then I proceed to elaborate pornographic fantasy in which affirmative consent is treated with a somewhat cavalier attitude."" "
One girl already has 3 times as many holes as I have dicks.

You haven't dropped it in the toilet yet have you?
"Ohhh my dog did this with my porch toad, Thomas. I was so hurt. "

"Back in high school, I went to see The Incredibles with a big group of people. The theater had different flavors of salt you could put on your popcorn (salt and vinegar, chili pepper, cheese, whatever). I was sitting next to a girl,  and her boyfriend was on her other side. Partway through the movie, she turns to me, holds out her fingers, and says ""lick this!"" 

I look at her boyfriend, look at her, and say ""pardon?"" 

She says, again, confidently, ""lick my fingers.""

""Why?""

""You need to taste this, it's really good!""

""...can I just have some popcorn?""

""Oh!  That's a good idea."""
"People constantly ask me, or slyly try to ask leading questions concerning my sexuality. Always have. I'm fairly sensitive and emotional most of the time, as well as pretty outgoing in social situations like smiley and happy. I'm never really stoic or traditionally 'manly'.  
  
I used to straight up tell people I was straight (which I am) so they'd fuck off with the interrogations and questions. Now I mess with people who try to find out about my sexuality, its none of their goddamn business and its fun to keep them wondering. "
Hello there!
Then you've never had sex on Molly
"I called him ""Myu"". Because it was the way this kitten meowed. Myu was a very curious kitten, and I lived in a building with only one floor with balconies, making a complete circle around the building. So Myu was from some other appartment, but decided I was his bro. So everytime my window was open, I heard ""Myu!"" and here he was, hoping to enter, and extremely curious, he was to smell everything.

Of course I started to get attached to this cat and of course, he suddenly disappeared soon after, the day her owner moved away.

Could not even wave him a little goodbye... from my balcony."
"The comments are just hilarious.

For those of you who think anal is overrated y'all just had crappy experiences."

Correction. It is not %100 accurate. I have many times accidently peed between the toilet and the toilet seat causing a mess. And dont get me started on trying to pee when your hard.
We fought over the dishwasher off and on for 12 years.  It took a discussion to realize I hate loading and he hates unloading.  It’s all good now.  We each do our part.  
I actually read the profiles.

Woman:  (*slaps his face and walks out*)"
"Hookups. Now admittedly I haven't had a loving partner in a few years, or some would argue I haven't ever, but grabbing a random piece of totty off the street is never as enjoyable as spending a night with someone you're under the illusion of being in love with. "
I can appreciate a beautiful man.  I can appreciate a beautiful waterfall.  I have no inclination to stick my dick in either.

"If it's my wife, I want to give her a hug, because either (1) she's cold and would like a hug, or (2) she's turned on and would, at least, like a hug.

"aw, I'm sorry :( I used to have a little spider that lived in my room. It's probably weird, because I normally hate bugs, but he would just chill in the corner and he was a cute lil guy, so I just let him hang out and I'd talk to him sometimes. then he died and I was really sad for a couple of days lol. I'm kinda sad because my roommate hates spiders, so I have to put any I find outside.

though one time I had to commit spider genocide because a spider laid eggs in my sleeping bag when I went backpacking, and then they hatched in my room. I like one or two spiders, but 500 crawling on my bed is.... a little too much.

edit: but there's a lil dude in my bathroom! he just sits on the window sill and keeps all the flies out. i named him todd"
"She is hurt. Simple as that. She didn't feel welcomed in your group, being treated in a hostile way, being giving a warning without doing anything wrong. It's always incredibly stressful meeting your partner's friends for the first time, and your friend did an awful job including her in your social circle. So she lashes out, probably scared you'd chose your friend over her, even though he was the one being rude. "
"If you are really far out in the sticks, you probably have minimal light pollution. Stargazing could be fun. You don't need a highfalutin telescope. You can probably get one relatively cheap.

Carpentry and woodworking. While the tools and supplies do cost money, the money you'll save once you get your own home will more than make up for it. These are life time skills that you can use for employment or yourself. It's easy to learn how to do most stuff. There are tons of websites and videos that explain things. You can learn almost everything you need to know and how to do it right from This Old House."

"Exactly. As a gay dude, I've had straight friends/coworkers tell me that they know of another gay dude who I might like. I've asked ""Is he attractive?"" only to have them say ""I'm not going there, dude. I can't be judging another man like that."" Like, c'mon dude. You know the difference between John Hamm and John Candy. Give me a break. "
"Oh shit, they know!"

"Theres a small table by the step outside that leads to my porch. My girlfriend always sits on that step to smoke. When we were setting up for our annual fantasy draft party, we needed the table, so I cleaned it off and brought it over. She immediately screamed ""oh noooo!"" as if I ran over her cat.

Apparently she had been hanging out with a spider bro every time she smoked all summer, watching him do his thing. I fucked up."

"I had a spiderbro named Pest Control Pete and we had a deal. He made his home above my suspended ceiling light, he kills the moths and flies that use that airspace and he doesn't leave that spot. One day I come home and he is halfway across the ceiling and I say, ""I'm sorry Pete but you knew the deal"". Went to grab the spray and when I got back he had fallen of the ceiling and was already dead. I am still yet to figure out if he knew what was coming and decided to maintain his honor if he simply died of age. The cooler alternative that I personally like is that I have a limited control over the souls that reside in my domain "

Seemingly, i'm bisexual and this is what is referred to as the bi- cycle. The bi- cycle is really fucking difficult for me. "

Then they both make up and fuck each other
"Anal sex. When done properly it can feel very good, arguably better than PIV, but there's just a lot of obstacles in the way of it. You have to find a partner who is willing and able to do it. (And if you do find someone, that's not a guarantee that she can accommodate *you*. Her past partners may have been less endowed and/or have a different penis shape than you.) That partner needs to clean herself beforehand or risk an embarrasing and thoroughly unenjoyable accident. More often than not a lot more foreplay is required before the deed can be done. You have to have lube and its application has to be spot-on; too much and you slip out too easily, not enough and it can be painful (and/or you have to stop to reapply the lube).

Pool, hot tub, shower, or any kind of sex involving water. It washes away everything, makes it harder to get a good rhythm going, and if you go at it long enough you'll get cold (excepting the hot tub, of course).

Beach sex. Sand gets everywhere and it isn't fun.

Waterbed sex. The sloshing is annoying, you're a bit more limited with positions, and it's more difficult to get good leverage."
"Heh... sorry all you people who have active sex lives and meaningful relationships with women, but you'll never beat me in crusader kings 2"

"An ex of mine and upper and lower navel bars. She asked me what I thought about them once and I gave her an honest answer; that they didn't really appeal to me but I wouldn't ask her to remove them and that if she liked them and they made her feel pretty, that was enough for me. I tried very hard to be diplomatic - and eventually she removed them. But I didn't expect her to, and had she not, it wouldn't have bugged me all that much.

Have you ever asked her about it? Just in a curious sense. Asked her where she got it done, when, how it was getting it pierced - just let her tell you the story. Then you can ask what she thinks about it, and chances are if she's kind of on the fence about it by this point she'll probably ask what you think about it - in which case maybe you can do what I did. But I'd caution you against giving your opinion on it if not asked."

"Funny is sort of my thing.  It works pretty well.

But what a lot of people don't realize is that funny is often code for a certain set of desirable qualities.  Comfortable with social interaction.  Being able to read a room.  Understanding not only what someone says, but what they mean.  Quick wit.  The sense to throw in something funny in a long list to break up tedium.  Empathy.  A certain level of confidence.

If you look at what ""funny"" is a catch all for, you can start focusing on those things, rather than just trying to be funny, which is more of a byproduct.

And I know plenty of couples where the woman is ""the funny one"", but I also hang out with stand up comedians, so my sample is skewed."

&gt;I'm also kinda tired of some shit she's pulling in a higher frequency lately, so I'm not really giving in just yet. I don't want to go into too many specifics but basically her behavior the last month hasn't been something I want to deal with consistently.

You should either walk away or let her know that her behavior is a problem and be prepared to walk when it doesn’t change or she won’t be accountable.

Otherwise, you’re going down the same path i was on:

I got tired of her shit, so I stopped spending a lot of time with her or being available to her. She noticed the distance and acted worse, so I created more distance. Eventually, she freaked out over something else stupid, and I just dumped her.

I had been thinking about leaving for months and had decided that the next time she started some shit would be the last time.

Id have saved us both some time by leaving months earlier."

"What your friend said was pretty disrespectful IMHO. He obviously cares about you, but he was still kind of a dick about it.

If I were in your shoes I wouldn't defend my friend, but I would also note his good intentions: ""his intentions were good, but I agree he went too far in what he said to you. At the same time, I don't want to compromise a long-term friendship over one slip up unless he does something truly malicious. In the future I would like you to refrain from insulting him to me. If my friend was constantly insulting you about some slip up on your part, I would tell him the same thing because you both deserve respect.""

Then if it kept happening I would move on from the relationship because it would show a pretty clear lack of respect, but you know your relationship better than I do.

Edit: Hey, just wanted to throw this out there so there's no ambiguity: your friend was definitely the dick here and after I thought about this post a little more I definitely think you should be weary about how he talks to your girlfriend. I also think that it's possible your girlfriend might be trying to articulate how she didn't like your friend preemptively marking her as a cheater even though she's done nothing wrong, and although she seems to be doing this in a pretty silly way her feelings behind her actions aren't silly. I imagine that in the same situation with one of her friends, you wouldn't be very happy. Just some food for thought going forward; I don't think your girlfriend's ""crime"" is how she's feeling, but instead how she's articulating those feelings in a nonproductive way (the same way you seem to be doing at the present)."
I'd watch them leave defeated when she rejects them.

"My wife is accusing me of being abusive of her, neglectful of our child, and an alcoholic since pretty much our entire relationship in our divorce.  This has been going on for over a year.  I was and am the complete opposite.  I was a devoted and responsible husband and father who gave up a lot on my wife’s request to be a stay at home dad.  

Let me tell you... the courts absolutely favor mother’s in family court.  They will put you through hoops on fire based on no evidence and just a woman’s word.  The only time you get to show evidence and prove you’re self is in trial which the court does not like to do for divorces (it’s not the same as criminal trials).  This has been truly the worst time of my life.  I’ve had my access to my young child restricted to almost nothing and then slowly built up again because they don’t see anything I’m doing wrong.  My wife has always had some very weird tendencies and behavior over the years, but I learned the hard way that deep down inside she’s SUPER messed up.  In the past year she’s:

- Admitted cheated and then denied it.
- Falsify an IRS letter to trick me.
- Had me falsely arrested.
- Kept our child away from me for two months.
- Claimed neglect when I have documentation proving otherwise.
- Claimed I hid money when I have bank statements proving otherwise.
- Hid $20k last summer.
- Tried to hide $120k home loan against the court’s instructions.
- Blocked my access to our child’s education records.
- Blocked my access to our child’s medical records.
- Given me medicine for him in prescription bottles with no labels or info.
- Got his school to write a letter that I was a menace (recorded and not true).
- Told forensic psychologist we always had a nanny (no nanny ever).
- Told him that our old marriage counselor was someone else who is now dead so as to keep him from contacting him about our true past.

Those are just the major things.  She’s consistently doing shitty, petty things involving our child as well.  A year later and she’s still claiming I’m a dangerous monster to be with our child yet the judge, law guardian, forensic, and supervised visitation have witnessed none of this kind of behavior and our child has only spoken wonderfully of me and how he wants to be with me.

Apparently he had these ""drinking parties"" almost every month from the time he was 12 or 13 because his parents would, for a date night type thing, go into the city and stay overnight at a hotel every month,  once a month, like clockwork.

"On the other hand, most of these concerns can be mitigated with escorts. I saved up and bought the services of 2 wonderful women for a birthday threesome and holy. Shit. Best money I've ever spent. Honestly a mind blowing experience. 

It alleviates the pressure to please knowing that no matter what, your partner will be satisfied (I always tip extra). Really removes all of the pressure of having to perform properly. Once you don't feel the pressure, you're just left with 4 boobs and 2 butts. Heaven.

I'd probably never have a non escort threesome because of all the risks and pressure. Maybe, but doubt it  "

Didn’t like being bad at talking to strangers so I worked in 100% commission sales to force me to learn how to do that


I didn’t like not knowing how to meet women so I spent a long time making an online dating spreadsheet, tracking my numbers (openers, responses, dates scheduled, meets) and kept tinkering around till I could meet women via online dating more-or-less whenever I wanted. 


I didn’t like getting friendzoned or ghosted on all my dates so I learned how to correctly express my sexuality


Lots of challenges and roadblocks along the way, but it’s deeply satisfying when I eventually overcome them and makes me a very happy and confident person overall, despite my flaws. The list goes on and on— most of my adult life has been spent recognizing things which make me unhappy and then figuring out ways to overcome them.

Before I met you, I had made less than great choices, including dating some women who messed me up. 

I probably should have gone over all of this before now, and I'm sorry for not letting you know about all that history, since it has, does, and will affect you and us.

Still, he's my best mate. It hurts me when you dig on him. I'd never treat your best friend the way you've treated mine. 

I would appreciate it if you could give him another chance with a fully open mind and heart.

If you can't do that, I understand. Your feelings are your own, and you're entitled to them, but I'll ask you to keep your negative comments to yourself.""

I hear it often from girls who identify as feminists as well where a comment pointing out an “undesirable” trait in a woman would be very ill received. Imagine if I made a comment about how I think a woman must be insecure about having a loose vagina. THAT would not be well received at all. 

Not to say that I think that this is a major problem that needs to be fixed. I just think that it’s a good example of how much of a hypocrite most people are, and that most of our opinions are only a product of our environment.

That it's okay to do things alone. And that you shouldn't pass up on things you want to do just because none of your friends are interested.
"Make the  most of all social interactions is the part I think people really fuck up on. It's like anything in life. Conversation takes practice. You can't just sit around waiting until you see some girl you like then pull out some 'A' game out of your ass. You need to hone it, have conversations with everybody you meet. If you're a dick head and are constantly trying to find things wrong with people places or things then stop. Start trying to find out about other people in your vicinity. Find things you have in common. Talk to them about things that interest them. Listen don't talk over them.  Have fun, enjoy conversations with people.  Then as you get more comfortable with it then you can use those skills to talk to women you like effortlessly. You're going to look like an idiot though if the only time you're interested in other people is when you think they're fuckable."
"Three year relationship for reference. 

The woman I was dating has a genetic condition known as Marfan Syndrome. It was mild on the outside, but a good portion of her insides, including her heart, were affected greatly by it. 

When we started discussing a future with kids, she made me aware of the risks. As in there was a very good chance she could tear open a heart valve during pregnancy or delivery and die. She still wanted to have kids though. 

For the life of me, I just couldn't understand that. I tried though, I really did, but I couldn't get past the fact that if she did die during pregnancy or delivery I would be the one raising the kid and she would be dead. And the only reason she would be dead is because she wanted a kid. What kind of life is that?

It eventually wore me down the closer and closer we got and the more we talked about it. She even started researching a newish open heart surgery that would greatly reduce the risks. That's when it was enough for me. I just couldn't picture myself in that lifestyle. I told her and that's how it ended. 

That was six or seven years ago. Shortly after that, she went through with the surgery. After that, she found a man, got married, and had a kid. From what I understand, the kid inherited the syndrome and her pregnancy took a big toll on her. She has massively bad body aches; the kid is in and out of the hospital, and she has not been back to work since. 

I personally believe I made the right choice. However, I lost some friends because of it. "

I had a friend who would employ ham as her sexfood of choice. Fucking *ham*. The Carl Buddig packets. 


Ham on the titties. Ham on the asscrack. Ham in the clam. Incredibly strange. She’d bust out the ham packets with first-time partners, too... even one night hookups. I’m not one to kink shame, don’t get me wrong. Ole girl had it figured out for herself. "

"A few weeks ago a spider landed on my head while I was chilling on my bed. Slight freak out, but I picked him up on a paper and tossed him out the window. The next morning there was a web in my window frame inside my bedroom. It's chill, as long as he stays there and doesn't land on my head again. 

A week later I feel bad for the little guy. He picked a terrible spot because there are no insects in my room. So I found an old fish net and caught a few flies from the compost heap and released them into his web. Over the next week he doubled in size with my daily fly deliveries. Spiderbro lookin good with those gainz. I even rigged up a fruit fly culture with some fermenting fruit juice and set it up under the web - a regular source of fresh bugs. The rotting juice smelled bad so I opened the window to ventilate a bit. The next morning spiderbro's web was gone and he was curled up in the corner. He hasn't moved in days. Spiderbro, I'm so sorry. "
"&gt; What are the ""adventurous sex acts"" guys want to do but their wives/gfs won't?

Gonna depend on the demographic, but for a surprising lotta dudes even blowjobs are wild unfulfilled dreams - especially once the honeymoon phase wears off.

&gt; How often are guys encountering starfishes in the wild?

Honestly, every time I sit down to read a newspaper and there's a ""hip young adventurous she-journalist interviews her hip young adventurous girlfriends about sex"", I get a new appreciation for my girlfriend's level of activity and generosity in bed, because the responses are 100% ""it's the man's job to do *everything* in the bedroom"" and ""he can be glad I'm there, what more would he want me to do?"".

&gt; What are you guys wanting that you aren't getting?

Nothing, but I'm not really adventurous.

&gt; You often hear that ""crazy girls"" give the best sex. What are the crazy girls doing?

Boundless enthusiasm and willingness to satiate the guy's appetite, as the ""crazy"" girls often (subconsciously) use sex as a way to keep their guy around. "
"I remember in middle school having butterflies in my stomach from a few of the kids in school, sometimes it was becausw they were nice to me, i thought they were pretty, whatever. Sometimes they were guys, sometimes girls. I never made a move since no one taught me that this was attraction or having a crush, and instead ran away from thosw feelings.

Fast forward high school, I'm sitting with a couple friends that are girls and they talk about boys. I hear them describe ""butterflies in the stomach"" and ""having a crush on him"". 

""...oh,"" I say, ""well shit. Hey whats it called when someone goes both ways?""

""Bisexual?"""

"Yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there champ. Sometimes you gotta get that carnal animal shit going on with someone where that's all you care about."
"If you lie, it will get out of control very quickly and will create more problems in the long term that it solves in the short term. When you get serious with a woman, you're not just getting serious about her - she's going to bring all her family, her friends and everyone else who's important to her along for the ride. 

If the family can't accept you, and she's not willing to disobey and functionally disown them, then you two have no future."
Nice.
Hours is only fun if you can go multiple rounds with breaks
"Don't make decisions when you're angry.

Don't take risks when you're horny.

The secret to getting good grades isn't natural intelligence; it's good time management and discipline. Discipline beats talent when talent is lazy. 

Especially in college. There are kids who coasted by in high school because they were smart. Sometimes they weren't that smart, their schools just had low standards. But once they're in college, these kids realize they actually have to study hard now, and struggle to change years of bad habits. 

After you're done with school, your credit score is your real GPA.

How to tell if someone likes you: you ask them out, they say yes and they actually show up for the date. If they reject you (and if they are rude about it), they did you a favor because now you don't have to waste your precious time on them. Better to get a definitive answer now than wonder forever. You're free to find someone who does like you.

If your SO doesn't have hobbies or friends, your relationship will *become* their hobby and they'll constantly complain that you don't care as much as they do and try to get you to do more and more for them. Their real complaint is you have a life outside of them. You both should have your own lives. You shouldn't be the only thing in their life.

Your girlfriend/boyfriend isn't allowed to cut you off from friends, family and people of the gender you're attracted to.

You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Choose friends wisely. Are they people like the person you want to become? (or at least on a good path?) Do they encourage you toward goals and give constructive criticism? Or do they mock you for no reason and feel threatened when you try to improve yourself? Some people will be offended by your self-improvement because they're more comfortable with mediocrity.

This goes for your SO's ""five people"" too. Do you like them? Do you at least get along with them? Sometimes, those friends act publicly how your SO acts when you're not around. They have no need to impress you, so they act naturally, whereas your SO might put up a good front. 

Trickiest situation is when most of their friends are fine, but one friend is a bad influence--who's often their best friend. You'll have to weigh the pros and cons of whether you want to put up with that or not. It can be hard to get an SO to cut off a bad friend; the longer they've known them, the harder.

Network and meet people, help them get ahead and they'll help you get ahead. The best jobs aren't advertised. The best opportunities aren't public. The best parties are private. 

Your people skills are as important as your technical skills. Don't expect to work hard and for people to just notice and reward you. Be proactive in building relationships. Your network is your net worth. 

Be careful who you take advice from. Have they accomplished what you want to do?  You'd be amazed at how much money advice you get from broke people, relationship advice from people in unhappy relationships, parenting advice from people whose kids are out of control, etc. 

Success requires going outside of your comfort zone. Applying for a great job you think you'd never get, moving to a new city with more opportunities but you don't know anyone, promoting yourself when other people might think you're obnoxious, etc. 

If you want to get what you've never gotten before, you'll have to do what you've never done before. If you're not in a position to get rejected, you're also not in a position to get rewarded. That's the price of success.

Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment.

You'll make mistakes, just learn from them and move on. No failure, just feedback. If you're not failing, you're not growing.

Confidence isn’t believing you’ll never fail. It’s believing failure won’t break you. 

You've got this."
"I dunno. Way back in the day, my best friend “gifted” me two ladies for a “massage” from the back pages of the Penny Saver. Showed up and it was a very obese gal and a deaf girl.

Then, when adults do have problems, they say ""hey so and so, I know so and so pissed you off but also I'm dating them / they're my best friend and they aren't going anywhere. I'd appreciate it if you could both play it cool. You don't have to love each other but it would mean a lot to me if you could find a way to put this behind you and get along.""

"Within the specific context of sexual arousal? It's very simple, when I see or touch an attractive woman, it causes an involuntary excitement response in my body hat doesn't occur when I see or touch an attractive man. I can tell when a man is physically attractive on a cerebral level, but there's no visceral excitement or arousal."
Have these response ever had you questioning yourself?

Bout sums up my experiences with sex so far
"The funny thing about attractiveness is that a huge factor in it is confidence. I’ve know a few guys (and I’d count myself as one) with poor skin or thin hair or a less-than-fit body who have no trouble coming across as attractive because of their attitude. Appropriate grooming and dressing also can’t be undervalued, even if there are other aspects of your appearance that can’t be changed. "
"Oh man your story hurt even more.

I am a woman. My nipples can be prominent sometimes no matter what I do. Bras are extremely uncomfortable especially ultra padded ones. I occasionally put tape over my nipples to conceal them but the truth is they’re there.  They stick out like my ears or my thumbs.  I am aware that I have them and that they can be flashy. I can deal with it if you can.  
"I really feel out of place sometimes as someone who dropped out of college to work blue collar (and currently on 3rd shift). I dont want kids, I dont smoke weed and I'm kinda kinky lol"
"There’s no great way to say this and not sound shallow. 

At the end of the day, it is her body and she’s allowed to do what she wants to it. You’re also allowed to not feel attracted to it, but you either have to a) accept it for what it is b) tell her and accept she may be mad at you or upset c) break up with her. 

Trying to force her to get rid of it to suit your personal view of attraction will not go well and will most likely make her feel really bad about herself, when I’m guessing she was pretty excited to get the piercing in the first place. "

"I just like being with her. Favorite moment that happened while cuddling.. the first time we did she laid her head on my chest and a minute or two looked up smiled and said ""I just heard your heart rate slow down"" Then looked at me like there was no place on earth she'd rather be. "
That quiet guy at the office who makes people laugh but mostly keeps to himself and is miserable and being killed from the inside by depression.
"I mean, what else?"
"Honestly, learn coding. Learn how to make webpages. Learn computer networking. There are plenty of great tutorials online and on YouTube. There may be some stuff on Khan Academy, I’m not sure. I know Harvard offers a free online course on programming. Whatever you choose, the more you learn about it, the easier you understand it. It may seem like an alien language, but bit by bit you pick it up. I taught myself how to build websites from scratch using html coding charts when I was 13.

Why do all of this? Because you’re learning an employable skill in an industry that is mostly a meritocracy. Get good and you’ll find a job. And you don’t necessarily need a college education if you have the skills. You can use these skills to get out of your podunk town and get a job making $80k a year.

Start learning to build websites now. Start learning to code now (Python maybe? Just pick a language and start). Work a little every day. By the time you’re 20 you can probably make some pretty impressive stuff. When I first learned to play guitar, it was frustrating. But I kept trying and got better bit by bit until I could finally play a full song by memory. All it takes is practice and coding is the same way."
"I hope it's not a required that my friend is an animal of some kind, but:

I recently broke up with the person who was by far my longest term, non-familial relationship: my barber left me. I'd see her about every 6 weeks on Sundays, as that's the day she was in my 'hood. Like many barbers, she works in a lot of places across town on different days, basically renting a chair and moving her supplies from shop to shop, like a ronin barber. The shop owner of the ship near me is a crazy person, and kept screwing with the costs and responsibilities of my barber, so she cut ties with the owner. Since I don't have a car, and her other weekend location is too far away for it to be a reasonable trip, we split up as friends after around 15 years.

Now I'm seeing a guy a couple neighborhoods away, but on a direct bus trip. He is a stern Russian guy who first  talked to me about my hair like no barber ever has, I have a new, shorter hairstyle that's more suitable to both my age and the expanding bald spot, I listen to classical music instead of pop during the cut, and I think this is the start of a beautiful haircutship. "
"This is, I think, one of the cruelest things that can legally happen to a person.
A man who finds out the child he loves as his own is the result of his wife's betrayal will feel humiliated, used, and less of a man. He will be confused and angry, and he will feel that no matter what he does, he will be judged harshly. He will be devastated, and he will know there will be no punishment for the one who did this to him.

In the end though, the overwhelming majority of men will, I think, continue to love and raise the child like nothing has changed. The child isn't to blame after all!"

"Woke up one day to a roommate telling me cops were at the door to arrest me. Apparently, I'd assaulted somebody at a bar the night before. Now, admittedly, I'd firmly pushed away a drunk chick trying to grab my junk multiple times, but I figured that shouldn't be too serious. Told my roommate this while getting dressed, and got taken to the police station.

Within 4 hours, my roommate showed up with two mates that were with me at the bar the previous night, the bartender, and a bouncer, who all corroborated my version of the story. Paperwork got done, I decided to press assault charges, she eventually got off with 3 months conditional with a 12 month probation."

"I've actually had both ends of the spectrum here so I feel obliged to comment

My first time was with a girl who was a virgin, and we both had 0 clue about what we were doing. I'm a lot thicker than average, and so she couldn't really take me. 10 minutes in and it just wasn't happening, kinda put me off virgins for a while.

However, I've taken a girls virginity when I was a lot more experienced. I knew I had to tease her into it, and it was fun teaching her a lot of things about foreplay and the like - it helped she was really curious about this, and therefore both very excitable to learn new things, and also very sensitive when it came even just fingering. For the actual act, we started off really slowly, but she eventually got into it, and it looked like she enjoyed herself a lot. From my point of view, holy fuck was she tight, it felt great. 

So yeah, it really depends on the girl I think, as well as the experience of the guy.

"From an outside perspective, Tinder economics seems so hard to navigate. If OP's assumption is true  - that guys swipe right on basically most people - which seems to be the case for many guys, simply because they know what they're up against (other guys doing that very thing, so their odds get better with right swipes on more people) - BUT for the women on the receiving end of those matches - all of a sudden - the premise of the mutual interest goes out the window, because for all she knows - she might as well be anyone, he just swiped right on her to even get his chances for whatever up. So the purpose of a match is sort of lost, and is transformed into frustration on men's part: because now they have to message this girl - because she probably won't - because she doesn't have any other way of determining actual interest in her as a person UNTIL he messages.

"I was in the same situation, except I was the girlfriend and it was my husband's brother that I was getting into it with all the time.

I don't really remember how it started, but somehow we decided we couldn't stand each other, so we would insult each other passive-aggressively and snark at each other all the time.  I thought he was an idiot.  He thought I was stuck up.

Then one day, we were going at each other, and my husband (my boyfriend, back then), suddenly slapped his hand down on the table and exclaimed, ""Don't make me choose between you!""

And I thought, Oh crap, how can I possibly compete with family?  I'd better button it, or I'll lose this guy.

And, according to my brother-in-law, (when we were discussing it, many years later), he thought, Oh crap, this is the girlfriend!  I'd better button it, or I'll lose him.

We didn't know what each other was thinking at the time, but we both decided to back off and start behaving like adults.  No more insults.  No more snark.

"I'll be honest, in high school and even a bit of college I used to put women and relationships up on a pedestal.

Now....... Not so much. My wife brings me back down to earth and I've definitely been viewing girls as regular people and not royalty.

So I used to do the opposite of objectifying. "
"For me, breasts. Visually, they get the chef a-cooking, and in a non-sexual setting it's always nice to sneak a squeeze. But in the bedroom, I always feel pretty underwhelmed by them, and it's distracting when you have to keep playing the nipple marimba when you're trying to concentrate on everything else. "
Well if you fucks quit asking about her then I'd never think about her.
Get yourself a cheap metal detector and check out old maps for interesting places to hunt.
"In college I knew a girl - cute face, good sense of humor, petite and busty - who insisted to me that leagues don't exist. 

I thought, sure, maybe not for *you* ..."
"I was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage cousin by my sister. The entire family shunned me. She was named the executor of my parents will over me. My parents died. She Took millions of dollars and I got nothing. A year later, my family realized what happened. I still don’t speak to most of them. "
"I was sexually assaulted as a child by a man, so I’ve always been at least a little confused. I would never have sex with a man or be in a relationship with one, as my attraction lacks any sort of terminus, but it’s there in a very very very slight way. My brothers teased me incessantly when we were growing up about being ‘over emotional,’ or ‘gay,’ having never really known the truth, so at this point I’m not sure if I’m just scared of being gay or actually not gay in any sense."
"Disagree. A good partner is very enthusiastic, reactive, and will tease out one better than yourself. 

The fact that it's imperfect also means that it will be drawn out having more buildup"
I think he was referring to the poop thing
"Yeah this about sums it up. Sometimes it's more like ""ooh nipples"".  If it was someone I was interested in it would be a different story though."
This.
SPARTAAAA!!!

"Threesomes because someone will be disappointed or jealous

Missionary if her feet are on the bed. If you’re not driving at least hold up your legs a bit

Foot stuff. I can appreciate well maintained feet but they belong in sexy shoes not on my dick"
"You know Rick, maybe you really aren’t that complicated."

"It took me a minute to realize this question is about gyms and not highschool. Back to the question, how else are they suppose to dry their balls and exert their dominance through display of genitalia "
"I really wish I liked it.  I think some people genuinely feel groovy when they get high, but to me it's just annoying, get all paranoid, feel stupid.  I think adults in a free country should be able to do drugs if they want.  The war on drugs money should be spent instead on education and recovery/medical treatment."
That eating healthy is easier than it looks.
does it count as pillow talk if it’s during sex? he was trying to have a full blown get to know me convo while we were doing the deed 
"It makes tits look more like tits, despite the fabric. So yeah, it's hot. Which can be bothersome cause you kind of find yourself sneaking glances not on purpose, but it's usually fine. "
