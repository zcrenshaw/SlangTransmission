"Wait, how could you remote into her computer when it didn't have wifi access? "
Usually when I see her she just screams about the restraining order.
"If it makes you feel a little better. When I was on a deployment project (replacing PC's) we had to call into the server team to get certain programs re-mapped or what have you to the new PC. If I got the 2 females that work there the job was done in 5 mins. Quick little chit chat with them, give them the info they needed and bam done. Then there was about 5 male techs that I would just hang up on because they would take a simple 5 minute job and turn it into a 1 hour adventure. While trying to tell them that's not how it is done."
"The sequel to the DS, the 3DS is currently sold and games are being made for it (also 2DS, which actually released after the 3DS did. I know, not confusing at all.)"
"""There is proprietary technology on my company PC that no one must be able to access, lest it compromise financial stability for years to come!""

"Hell yes.

Due to staff retirings, I'm the only person left who has admin rights to the Security access card system for the entire facility.  If I'm in a bad mood, I can delete all the users from the database and no one will be able to get to the server to fix or restore the system.  Probably need to take a fire axe to the door to gain entry.

No one wants to be trained on the system, so it will be interesting if/when I retire as well.  I guess the vendor will be brought in at $900 a day service rates."
"Or, rather than a marker, what about a ball point pen? It would make thin, hard to see lines in a photo. I can imagine her filling out a spreadsheet by hand for some reason."
"Apparently they repeatedly asked her to read the data out loud, so probably not that. (Or if it is, she can't read?!)"
Or emailing me to tell me their email isn't working.
Copy and paste that.  My Fitbit recorded a dangerous blood pressure spike there.
"That one works well on an analogue line.

""What can we help you with today?""

**Crackle crackle crackle**

""I'd like the line to stop doing that."""
"Five consecutive nights. Neither the FDA nor I caught it even after I arrived after work and found my key didn't work. The SECOND day I arrived after work and my key didn't work I was like ""What gives?"" and got ""well thats odd..."""
"May not have made any alert noise... I've seen some laptops not give any alerts or errors and still just shut down.

I've worked with customers' laptops that sounded like little jets trying to take off. I work for a copier company and so it wasn't really my place to try fixing their laptops but there have been a few times when I was left alone with the computer, whirring away and barely acknowledging my inputs because of the near thermal melt down going on inside, so I would attempt the cheapest, easiest fix. I blew a short blast of breath into the exhaust port and typically receive a nice face full of dust for my efforts however it has worked several times allowing the fan to actually pass some wind (couldn't resist) and cool down enough to stop its screaming."
"I‚Äôm just adding a comment to a random thread so I can find my way back to see how this turns out. 
I‚Äôll be back after I make some popcorn..."
Oh neat! TIL!
"Had this same license issue in the last five years in a previous position...the thing was, *any number of extra licenses could have been purchased, but the company refused to.*

The downtime this resulted in was staggering, because not only were we distributed across 4 floors of a building (we had this hilarious winding staircase and you could always tell when someone wanted a license, because they would come stomping up/down), we had other remote locations that sometimes logged in too.

There was no way to boot people off, and the licenses were **shared with our retail store too.** It resulted in transactions taking many times longer than needed, and sometimes losing sales because people couldn't wait. The same licenses were used by the repair dept, resulting in not being able to update or close repairs.

The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the owners couldn't log on, and would start screaming for someone to sign off so they could get on, and, because they were on the same floor as the corporate sales team, everyone would refuse because they were the moneymakers."
And then you started writing anekdotes for the BOFH archives? :P 
"I was waiting for a u/shittymorph style transition into the rant from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Not sure if I'm relieved or disappointed that it didn't."
Que?
"Putting a laptop on a desk should be best case scenario for airflow.

Was this an HP?"
"&gt;  Does the data smell like toast?

I was possibly thinking stroke. might ask what the data taste like ?!?

@op maybe post the pictures if you can without disclosing any company or identifying info."
"Travel teams almost universally suck. There ought to be a subreddit just for things the ""travel professionals"" (gag) screw up, like:

The time they booked me for 5x 1 night stays instead of 1x 5 night stay.

The time they booked me a hotel 150 miles away from the work site when the hotel across the street was $50/night cheaper

The time they booked me a hotel in a town that had zero restaurants and wouldn't let me get a car.

&amp;#x200B;

And I consider myself one of the fortunate ones, coworkers have much worse stories..."
"I mean... Instant death is still better than a long, painful, one, right?

Because Polonium will kill you slowly, surstr√∂mming will not mess around.

In any case... Thanks, I guess? :P"
"&gt;site that calls computers ""modems"" and corrects us every time 

Yeah, also assuming its some OSD. I had to fix ""granny""'s screen that has the OSD cycling through the all the menus once per sec. No chance to press anything.. That was a fun one. :)  
Fixed it by chaning the Hz in windows, that reset the screen and menu's disapeared (no, turning it off and on again did NOT work.)  
"
"Thanks, no worries. The reality is we have no way to be efficient because...no one in our department understands what we do. And they keep tossing more stacks on top whenever we get a handle on things. Most of our actual responsibilities have shifted to back-end work, so theyre clueless. They think we are idle-talking and drinking Red Bull qhen in fact we're dealing with calls, IA compliance, keeping the servers they depend on running, all that. So trust me, slow-walking these First-World bullsh*t 'problems' of theirs is not just deserved but necessary. Thank the stars for Xanax."
"As soon as I read ""greased light poles"" I immediately knew and started laughing hysterically..."
"I think she is having a stroke or have a floatie in her eye socket that her brain is not filtering out

Unusual vision showing up on her eyes that is not visible on the monitor, but is quite obvious when dealing the color on her computer‚Äôs wallpaper.  Ask her to look at a white and bright wall to see if the ‚Äúdata‚Äù is there too.  If so, a doctor visit is recommended."
"WOOT! 

You pull a knife, we pull a gun. You pull a Lawyer? We pull the whole damn Legal Council. "
"Appreciate the clarification, that's what I thought, thanks!"
Good thing it wasn't in his lap then he would have been cooking.
"Those who can't do, do for the government."
Or a Bring Your Own Shovel policy.
"Yes, but one intern will do more to appease the tech spirits than the entire dev team, due to the skill level of each. So sacrifice both."
"I applaud you.
You have survived.
You are the best of us."
The ATF would like to know more...
"One of my colleagues had someone tell him that he wouldn't restart is printer because ""it's the job of a technician"". He told the user that it's actually easier than printing, and got written up."
"In my experience, it's more common among private universities than state/public universities (at least in my region of the US), likely because people expect fancier words for their money. "
"There are on-premise/self-hosted syncronization tools.

Take a look into ownCloud and NextCloud. For some they might install it in a manner that can be accessed off-site, but it's meant to be a tool with similar capabilities to Dropbox but where you are in full control of the data."
Or share a hole dug in the Utah desert...
Those are rookie numbers. NEXT!
"Greasing light poles, huh? I think you might be from my city üòè"
I don't mind waiting for the packageManager version
"Your desire to be remotely nice to non-unicorns.
Your determination to help people.
Your sanity.
You name it, you'll probably lose it (or know someone who is about to/has lost it)"
She's insane
"Whooosh ;)

I know it's not that abomination, I just like to mess with people."
