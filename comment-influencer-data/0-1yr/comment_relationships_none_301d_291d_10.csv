"Honestly they’ve only met you once? I don’t think it’s the parents, I think it’s your boyfriend not inviting you out and making the effort to include you. It doesn’t make sense that it’s them IMO 

Edit: and if you’re serious with this relationship and your bf isn’t putting his foot down to include you if it is in fact his parents then thats really big problem beyond them"
"Totally separate from the point of your post, I know, but--please, do *not* offer to host anyone in your house that looks like they might have bedbug bites. Bedbugs can ride on clothing and infect *your* house."
There are consequences for doing the right thing. You did the right thing. Some people won't ever like you for doing the right thing. Keep doing the right thing.
"Oh, dear.

I’m wondering if your success/recognition for your work has changed the way she sees your roles in the relationship. She’s The Artist; she doesn’t sell out, and she’s generous with her wisdom - as long as she’s the expert.

You’re supposed to be The Suit/The Conventional One/The ‘Patron’ of the Artist. You ‘sell out’ by actually earning money and being part of ‘the system’, and you’re supposed to be awed by the inherent talent of The Artist. But of course you could never aspire to such lofty heights as she inhabits; you’re just a dilettante.

But now you’re fucking up that dynamic. If you can create art AND work AND have people seeking you out, then she’s no longer the super special magical one with the rare gift in this relationship, is she?"
"Call it quits. Dude is gettin' weird fast. The dog walk thing is really odd, but the insisting on being with you and your friends and then essentially refusing conversation when they make a legit effort to talk to him is even worse. It's rude. It's disrespectful toward you and your friends and the relationship you have with each other. He's trying to isolate you, and that's always a bad path."
"It's hilarious. I mean next time you speak to him and he's ready, you could spin it around and say how your half brother was pretty pleased to know your bf thinks his place is the best in town. 

Or tell him he can make it up to you by cooking you a nice meal.

It'll make the whole situation turn into light hearted fun. I am a little hungry ...but the answers still valid :p

However, if he acts like this again at something trivial in your opinion, then that's a red flag."
"“Dad, I’m not upset that you’re dating x and I’m sure she’s a great person, but it’s still too painful for me to be around her because it reminds me of mom. Please don’t try to get us to do anything together for the time being, I’ll let you know when I’m ready.”

I’m so sorry for your loss, sending love your way &lt;3"
"""So what's more important--me getting on with the people you work with, or you showing me off to them?""

Because I'd bet he was more interested in them meeting Engineer You than Human Being You."
A natural 20 on a Charisma check!
"He's being completely disrespectful and you have every right to be uncomfortable. I wonder if your girlfriend wouldn't be bothered if you had a female friend who said the same things to you. It's also quite weird that he confessed having feelings for her and she seem to have ignored it. I hardly think she'd cheat on you but this kind of ""friendship"" is poison to a healthy relationship. You start to feel insecure and have controlling thoughts, and that's just not right. But being disrespected is also not right either. I think you should sit down and talk about it and make sure she understands that you're feeling completely disrespected."
"The standard response to this should be ""I want you to be friends with people who are friends of the relationship"".

This guy clearly wants to have sex with her. You can't be friend with someone actively trying to have sex with you when you're in a relationship "
"It sounds like your cats are named Mister Boy, Runts, and Nips, and they also have nicknames. If that's what you usually call them, then those are their names. I think you two are just bickering over semantics more than anything else. "
Also saying you have to dumb yourself down is pretty obnoxious. It's also a coping mechanism. 
"Wow, what an asshole. Please continue to point that out to him as it comes up, but I doubt he will change. He even wants YOU to fix it, neat way he sees women huh? I'd distance yourself in a big way whether or not you move out."
"It’s fair to restrict the guest list, especially as far as having a “no randoms” policy, and excluding alumni who are no longer involved in the club and don’t behave appropriately. 

But excluding current club members is tough, because if not everyone is aware of why those people are being excluded, it *does* look cliquey. I’m not saying you’re wrong to exclude them, but it’s the kind of thing where for the sake of appearances it might bear discussion. 

It might be worthwhile to make an announcement at the next club meeting that there’s been some inappropriate behavior at past parties, and such behavior will not be tolerated going forward. 

Let the group know that people who can’t treat others with respect at club-sanctioned parties will no longer be invited. If people do not wish to attend parties where predatory behavior is unwelcome, there will be no more club parties. And then you can throw parties with only people you like, without being under the auspices of the club. 

Edited typo "
"Thank you for doing what you could for your niece.  Might I suggest a weekly ""check up"" text and occasional get togethers (lunch, coffee, homework help?).

If he is abusive to his wife, that girl might also be in trouble (emotional abuse us very damaging), and being there to monitor might help her more than you realize. "
"Your friends and family already know you want out. So do it.

I was so, so embarrassed that I was getting divorced. I felt like a failure. Like no one could love me. I didn't want to tell anyone. I was crying and I finally broke down and called my mom and I sobbed it out and told her I was leaving. She said ""Hold on"" and I heard her set the phone down. And then I heard her yell to my dad ""Hey, you called it! She's finally leaving that asshole"".

So yeah. Hearing that actually helped a massive amount. People sense you are unhappy and in reality are just waiting for when you take that step. This is the time you gotta broaden your safety net - I wouldn't be surprised at all if they are waiting for you. "
"&gt; Should I just swap jobs? When I joined the company I was in a bad place in life (still with abusive wife) and I made a terrible impression. Would a fresh start be an idea?

This... isn't the worst idea. I'm not a fan of running away from your problems, but people really underestimate the power of a fresh start. That said...

&gt; I have worked very hard my whole life to dumb myself down and to try and conform to what people expected/wanted from me.

I feel like I know a lot of people like you. Just know that the rest of out here can tell when you're trying to be someone you're not. You might want to consider going back to therapy during your job hunt or the first few months of the new job to make sure you aren't repeating old patterns."
"If you reach out to her, tell her she was right, he was wrong, that she should drop him as a client for good. But that you are happy to be a reference for her in his place. You can easily vouch for her being trustworthy and talented, that even your asshole roommate loved her haircuts. Make it short, hand her a card with your name and number in case she needs it, and don't pressure her to talk more if she's uncertain. 

Small businesses are hard, especially for recent immigrants, and women who get preyed on by their clients. Showing you support her side of the story not his bullshit could be incredibly validating for her and relieve a lot of mental anguish. 

You can tell him, but you also don't want to be in the middle of a fight with your mysogynist roommate, so I'd support you telling him off once and mostly leaving it be. 

"
"Your mom sounds like a narcissist (with charming hints of racism). If you have family nearby you could stay with that’d be better than spending thanksgiving alone but if they’re too far then it may be right for you to go back to uni. Also I think going to CC would be much better for you financially and mentally since you want to be with your grandparents and that could help them a lot and cut your living expenses more. 

Remember that it’s your life. Not your moms. "
"Okay this is... Actually kinda disturbing to me at how accurate it might be because a running joke between her and her friends used to be that our relationship was like a manic pixie dream girl indie movie where she was the artsy punk girlfriend and I was the boring uptight love interest. :/

I guess if this actually is the reason why she's upset, how do I tell her that I'm definitely not trying to ""take over"" her interest or overshadow her in any way? I greatly admire her talent as an artist, I always have and always will."
"Dude, you’re 100% correct!! I went to a community college for 2 years, then transferred to a university, and went on to get my masters degree in substantially less debt that a lot of my friends. I still met and married a nice boy, and didn’t end up in porn. Your mom sounds unreasonable, you need to talk to your dad. It sounds like he is going to try to defer to your mom, but you tell him, no, I’m not involving her in any of these kind of decisions anymore. "
you're 20 years old what are you doing wasting your time with a guy thats already cheated on you and still sexting other women? come on girl 
"&gt; Is all of this my fault?

 In the sense that you continue to engage with this garbage man, yes. How about you block him on everything and don't wait for him to decide it's time for the annual 2 minute hate.

This guy sucks and hewa ts to hurt you"
"I might ask her how she feels when she goes into the room. Let that guide you. If she still spends time in there remembering, then I would hesitate to disrupt it. She may inquire why you ask and you could say you were thinking about how the room might be used, at some appropriate time. It seems like this might introduce the subject in a way that makes it clear you're not going to push her if she's not ready."
"Yeah, to me it sounds like your boyfriend's brother is advocating for her and your boyfriend isn't advocating for you"
"Make it sound serious. When you get to the room tell him you have something serious to talk about. Seem stressed. Make it seem like you think he'll bail once h hears the bad news. Then just say ""I fart in my sleep""."
I was hoping you'd give more details on the logistical impact this has had on your life. Are you still working full time? Is this a 10 hour a week hobby? How much free time do you have? I think specifics are needed
Yay! Good communication!
"I teach in a Title I school.  The vast majority of my students do not live like your boyfriend's family does...  Like you say, being poor does not automatically mean being unhygienic, and wanting things clean does not mean that you hate poor people.  It is not unreasonable to not want to go into a house that has shit everywhere and active bug infestations.  "
"Choking is a huge precursor to men murdering their partners. The fact he does it while sober is telling, as is the love bombing after. You need to leave, safely. Don’t tell him ahead of time, just pack your stuff while he’s not at home and get out. You can break up by text and then no contact. 

You are in very real danger. "
"This is a great update and I'm happy for you guys. This is also serving as a reminder to pretty much everybody not to neglect your own happiness and try too hard to derive it from a relationship. We all need to function outside relationships, and have our own goals, hobbies, friends etc. I know I myself can get so wrapped up in new love that I forget what I used to enjoy on my own before."
"I you want to decline the MOH role, I would say something like, “Cousin, your wedding party is supposed to consist of the biggest supporters of you &amp; your relationship. You know that I love you &amp; would do anything for you, but I also can’t be a supporter of this relationship. Fiancé doesn’t treat you with the respect you deserve from the person you’ll spend the rest of your life with. I can stand next to you on your wedding day, but I can’t pretend to be excited that you’re marrying this guy. If that will cause issues for you &amp; Fiance, I understand &amp; can step down from the role. Either way, I will always be there for you when you need me.”"
"Why haven’t you flat out asked her if she’s been taking it? You need to just ask her. 

Edit to say- at this point unless she shows you any reassuring proof she is. STOP HAVING SEX WITH HER. Dur "
"The cool thing about leaving a very bad relationship is that you join a very big club of people who have also left very bad relationships and survived to tell the tale. You get to realize how many badass people around you have been treated horribly in the past, and it all starts to feel a lot less personal. Your husband is a terrible partner. You're an awesome person who's brave enough to get out of this. "
"I think your girlfriend is jealous of your success. At first I thought, maybe she's jealous of the time you spend on it, but it seems like you try to address that. But it seems like her behavior got worse and worse as your potential for success grew. Maybe she's having less personal success than she wanted and that's making it worse. 

I get that you can't picture a life without her and don't want to break up. But man...your girlfriend went from telling you your scripts were great, she loved helping with them, when you were starting to saying they're garbage and you are delusional once you started getting traction. That's someone who does not want you to succeed. Is that someone you want in your life?"
"I ask you the same question as I did on the other post: 

What sort of future do you see with a guy who makes you out to be the bad guy in your relationship and airs your dirty laundry out in public for everyone in his family and friend circle to see?"
[deleted]
"Grew up dirt poor here. “We took care of our things.” Yes. I totally get it. You don’t have to have nice things but I totally grew up the same way. Take care of what little you have. Brush your teeth. Make sure the shower is clean. Keep the dishes put away. You don’t have to have money to keep beer bottles off the porch. 

I think this might be a dealbreaker. You’ll never bring your kids around or be able to submerse yourself with his family because of the filth. And it’s not stuck up of you at all. I’m sure you’d be happy to step foot in a one-room shack if it was clean and his family was there. 

It’s okay that this is upsetting. It is valid. And I’m glad you kept your kids from there. "
"&gt;""Just because your family was poor and took every handout you could doesn't mean we should encourage other people to do it. It's not our problem if some kid doesn't have a pair of winter boots. Maybe their parents should have pulled out.""

This is less about your boyfriend not wanting you to contribute to charitable causes anymore, and more about his complete disrespect towards your parents, your background and - most importantly - you.

Give yourself the best Christmas present ever this year by dumping him. He's shown himself up to be cruel, elitist and conceited, and it's clear from your post that you deserve far better than that."
"Yeah. Not everyone around you is dumb - people not getting your humour isn’t them being stupid, and seeing them as dumb isn’t going to help. Don’t think that was OPs intention, but comes across that this may be an issue?"
Give him space? Oh yeah for sure. Give him an infinite amount of space. So much space that you never see him again. Dump him. Break up with him. He's being abusive. Don't be afraid of dropping this dude like a bad habit. 
If the boyfriend goes to both houses already it's too late. 
"In addition to the general consensus of only inviting her and the kids, maybe consider reaching out to the kids in general. You aren't obligated, but it might be nice for them to have an aunt to talk to about all the shit that's going on.



 Once they turn 18 (of if your sister is okay with it), maybe you can invite them, even if they don't go. "
"Your husband isn’t shutting her down enough. She shouldn’t be running her hands through his hair, complaining about you, calling him etc. He needs to be more firm and tell her she’s making him uncomfortable and to leave him alone unless it is strictly work related . "
Just tell her. Don’t wait too long to do it. Don’t make it a big deal just say hey this happened 
Pretty sure its not his first time and he probably waited to ask till he felt comfortable enough to do so. I feel like if he was only doing it for his own gain you woulda caught on well before. Communication is key! I would talk with him tonight before anything happens just to make sure you're both on the same page before continuing. Just let him know during the conversation you're not trying to hurt his feelings or and thing just looking out for your own.
"He doesn't have to cheat on you or hit you for you to leave. 

Relationships aren't supposed to be like this. You don't have to feel so bad all the time, and your deserve much better than that. 

He sounds cold and unloving. Do you want your forever to look like that? "
"I grew up super poor, in a very rural, poverty stricken area.  
Poor is not an excuse for filthy.  
Even now, I am not as poor as I was, but I am not well off.  
I live in a house that needs a TON of work.  
It was left to me in an old friend's will, and he and his late wife spent 20 years smoking inside. Everything needs ripped out and replaced.  
But as bad as it looks, it still stays CLEAN. Like, you can tell it needs money to fix it, but you can also tell it is clean, and as hygienic as possible. I do not have bugs, and people that come over know that it is not my choice to have a dirty looking walls and carpet.  
My advice, Better to be called stuck up, than to have roaches and bedbugs."
"&gt;  I mean next time you speak to him and he's ready, you could spin it around and say how your half brother was pretty pleased to know your bf thinks his place is the best in town.

THANK YOU I have to text him now with this. "

"If you consider it necessary to ""dumb yourself down"" for people it probably comes across as you being condescending because it absolutely is. "
"Whoa whoa whoa, wait. 

Do you currently support the both of you, or does she also work? If she works, how much does she make in relation to you (more, less, about the same)? How would you describe her career ambition in relation to your career ambition (more, less, about the same)- and specifically career, as in direct earning potential. 

A lot of these details are very important. They add context as to whether she is behaving because she's tired of ""supporting"" your hobby and wants you to become more realistic about your future, versus she's becoming insanely petty, immature, and jealous and is now praying for you to be a failure so you'll stay with her. 

The latter scenario often happens when people think they have the ""upper hand"" in a relationship and want to keep it that way. They don't want their partner to be equal or better than them. This manifests in people who are pretty ugly on the inside,""crabs in bucket"" mentality - if I'm not successful, you're not allowed to be more successful/famous/etc than me. Deep down, it's because some of they realize they are not good enough people to deserve someone who is so successful/semi famous/good person, etc - so to ""trap"" their partner in staying, they try as hard as possible to say negative things and bring down their self esteem until their partner is back on ""equal"" ground with them. The idea of being proud of you and elevating themself up to your level never strikes them as an option - the only option for these people is to bring you down. And TBH that's the way I'm learning with your gf but we need the extra info "
"That's a good point. I have a full time job, it's a pretty standard 9 to 5 and I make enough to support both of us. When I first started writing a year ago I used to be pretty involved, like I used to write for hours during the weekend, but my girlfriend used to be as into it as I was and would even ask to write together if I was doing something else. Right now I only write during my lunch break at work because if she knows I'm working on it at home she gets moody. The rest of my free time is spent doing whatever she wants."
"You really need to calm down...there isn’t an issue here at all. 

She asked if you’d be alright with a party, and didn’t manipulate you into saying yes  - because she also said if you weren’t ok with it she could just do it at her boyfriend’s. 

You said no, she respected that and agreed. 

That should’ve been the end of it, and you certainly should not have attacked her for asking in the first place. 

If it were your roommates I would be a little worried about how aggressive you’re coming across, you can’t take offence to someone making an honest request. It sounds like they’re trying to be understanding and accommodating, with your other roommate even going so far as to sympathise with you attacking the first one for asking (which he didn’t need to do), but if you’re not careful you’ll quickly become the bad roommate before you’ve even moved in. "
"Your boyfriend sounds very defeatist. He’s already decided you’re going to leave him because of his depression - I’m guessing so he doesn’t have to work on anything. In his mind it doesn’t matter what he does because you’re going to abandon him anyway, and that gives him a reason to avoid working on his mental health and communication skills. He needs to put in effort or it’ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

If you want to continue the relationship, let him know you’re there for him but he needs to open up to you and also try to get help. If you don’t want to continue the relationship, you’re not a bad person. "
"Thanks for the advice guys! The general consensus is to break up with him, which after some thought I 100% agree with. Now, time to think of a way to break it of, haha..."
"He's still having an emotional affair. If you want this to work, he has to find a new job, cut off all contact and you two must go to couples therapy and he should probably go on his own.

If this was my marriage, it would be over. He's continuing to pick her over you. "
"1st. Your husband needs to tell his boss what's going on.  He doesn't have to make it an official complaint yet, but he needs to let someone know what's happening. 

2nd. After he has told his boss what's going on, he needs to tell the woman to cease touching him, and to please keep all communication to work channels.

3rd. When it continues, he needs to make an formal complaint about her behavior.

Lastly, he needs to just not respond to her personal communication attempts at all.

But that's just how I'd deal with it.  I think you need to take the concern about ""drama"" out of the equation.  No one I know would think it's ""innocent"" for a woman to run her hands through another man's hair. (and vice versa)"
"I didn't get past the part were you said a man approaching 30 was dating a 16 year old. OP your boyfriend is a sexual predator. If a 16 year old girl who you care about came to you and told you she was being pursued by a man in his LATE 20'S, would you think that he had her best interest at heart? Or would you tell her to run from this man?"
"I'm really happy for you that you were able to get out and find a better guy.   

&gt;Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider.

Sadly this is such a low bar for the ""better guy"".   All guys should be able to meet this criteria."
"&gt;Whenever I bring it up to my boyfriend he says he always tries to ask his parents if I can come with them to these things too, and they always make an excuse as to why I can’t.

Are you sure your BF isn't lying about this? Because it really, truly doesn't make sense that they would be trying so hard with his brother's GF and not with you. Unless there's some kind of crazy golden child - scapegoat thing going on with BF and his brother, and I feel like he would probably have mentioned that."
"If doing the right thing was easy, everyone would do it and the world would be a better place.  Unfortunately it takes brave people to stand up for their principles.  "
"That isn’t usually the kind of thing one can successfully tell someone, if their self-worth is tied into believing the opposite.

It’s worrying that she can’t see a life where both of you are successful artists. Or that her art isn’t successful and yours is, but she finds happiness anyway. Have you asked her what would happen with either of those scenarios?

Now many men have ended up destroying their wives’ careers, either on purpose or by accident. But you don’t seem headed that way. In which case, this might be about a nasty case of jealousy and egotism."

"&gt; He even wants YOU to fix it, neat way he sees women huh?

This is what gets me the most.  Like, I could conceive of a scenario where he was close enough and comfortable enough with this woman that such a forward request wouldn't be completely out of line and he totally misread the situation.  But the fact that he doesn't have enough integrity to apologize to his hairstylist himself and instead cowardly and selfishly asks his roommate to do it shows his true colors - that he's a creepy shitbag who was likely trying to exploit his hairsylist's recent breakup for some sex.  What an asshole.  "
"&gt; ""Words have consequences"".

Good god that is terrifying.  Op...That means he chose to choke you as punishment for your words.  This man CHOSE to put your life at risk in order to make you behave how he wanted.  He chose to squeeze hard enough to put you in fear of your life.  He was not out of control...this was deliberate...twice.

This man WILL kill you eventually if you stay.  Choking is THE number one indicator of future romantic partner homicide.  You need to get away from him immediately and call the police while you still have the evidence on your neck that he attempted to kill you."
"I think you're having communication issues and vastly different understanding of the topic of what ""being ready"" and ""wedding"" and ""engagement"" means.

\- You both talked about and agreed on getting married after graduation, spring 2020.

\- You feel that once school is done, you'll be ""ready"" for getting married. As in, the entire topic, including getting it started. Before is too early, as you're both still in school, but once that's over with, your head will be free for that.

\- She understood that by spring 2020, there'd be a wedding. Not as in ""let's start talking about getting married"" but straight up as ""wedding ceremony: spring 2020"".

\- Both readings of the conversation sound valid to me, but coming from vastly different understandings what each of you were talking about.

\- It's also possible that you really meant spring 2020 as a point in time for a wedding, but don't understand what that means. Because planning a wedding takes a lot of time and effort and energy, and proposing this Christmas sounds absolutely reasonable in that time frame.

\- She knows that, in order to get the 2020 wedding, that you discussed, things need to get starting.

\- You feel entirely overwhelmed by all of this. Why now? That's far in the future! It's too early!

\- Letting you know that she thinks it's time to talk to your family is perfectively reasonable under her (perceived) time frame. Good for her to bring it up instead of silently brooding.

\- That her friends are messaging you about it is icky and should stop. They are probably under the assumption that you two will get married in spring 2020, and feel it's time.

\- You don't feel like it's time at all. Because you are not ready to get married. You sound like you may be ready to get engaged in spring 2020, but not to wed.

\- You need to communicate this to her, because that's not what she heard the last time you talked about the topic. I get this from you saying neither of you should drop out of school for this. But to her, that's not the point. You'd both be out by then.

\- Try to get a vague overview what it means to plan a wedding. Because she started that process in her head, and you seem to underestimate what that entails.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, as a divorced person, I'd not even consider getting married before you lived in the same apartment for at least a year, but that's just me.

&amp;#x200B;

OPs GF is getting demonized in a lot of comments, but the only thing she really did was telling him to talk to her parents when it's time. None of us know what she talked about with her friends. None of us know why the friends are writing OP. Did she tell them to? Did they decide to do that on their own, thinking it's normal and helpful? Did they do it to pressure OP because that's what GF wants? All possible. All unknown."

"Dude, that’s a 4 hour party!  People showed up, you think they had fun.  That’s a success. 

Going forward just make mental notes of things you can improve for the next time. Whether it’s different games or music or drinks or a different mix of people.  But don’t beat yourself up over this event. "
"She's a freelance artist. Her commissions are pretty sporadic because she doesn't like advertising so her client base is pretty small, but she contributes to joint expenses like groceries. She used to have a fairly steady job but it was completely unrelated to her art so she quit about a year ago to focus on her art. I don't see myself quitting my job anytime soon to pursue screenwriting as a full time job, I still see it very much as a hobby and I don't know how I would feel turning it into a career."
"Don't re-add him.

Do tell store management what has happened. Learn more about the anti-harassment policies at your workplace, and ask management to help come up with a plan for dealing with him when he, inevitably, shows back up.

If he comes in, your best bet is to be as unresponsive as possible. Do not answer questions. Do not lie to him in attempts to calm him down. (Un-adding him was personal. He's a nasty person. He knows this on some level. Lying will not solve that. ) Nod as he says crazy things. Do not debate him. Do not apologize. Follow management's plan, which should probably involve you excusing yourself to the back while a supervisor explains to him that he needs to leave.

Management, yourself and your co-workers should all be ready to call the police if needed.

EDIT: Please ignore everyone here telling you that owed him ""a reason"". You did not. You have an absolute right to end contact with someone. You didn't mess this up. He did. He owes it to other people not to harass them. Period. Showing up at a person's place of work to angrily confront them is never okay and always a good way to end up in the back of squad car.

I suspect what they are actually trying to tell you is that you're less likely to become a target of harassment if you tell gentle lies to obsessive and aggressive men to try and make them feel better about themselves, and sometimes that *is* true (although often, no reason is good enough for this type of person anyways)."
"I'm a black woman, dated many white men. Only one who's family I actually met, and some of them were racist. The difference is, he kept me out of their company whenever possible and stood up for me when people got toxic. 

Now maybe I'm more forgiving, but I wouldn't necessarily leave your bf over this. I would confront him: ask why he didn't just explain that they're racist, make sure he never intends to bring you around them again, and make sure if  you're ever in the presence of *other* racists, he will stand up for you. If he can't do all of that though, yeah, leave him. "
"So, when people gravitate towards abusive and unhealthy relationships, a lot of the time it's an issue of poor self-esteem and lack of faith in their own judgment. So when you and your family tell her things like ""You've chosen another loser, why can't you see it, remember how many losers you've picked before?"" you're actually mimicking the same dynamic that she has with these men. The one that basically says she isn't smart, doesn't make good choices, and can't be trusted to know her own mind or look after her own well-being. It's so very tempting to point out, but it's never going to be an effective tactic. You also very neatly set it up for these men to say ""They don't trust you, they don't believe in you, they've always hated any man you've brought home, why would you let them ruin our special special love?"" No good.

Captain Awkward has some great tips about what might be happening here and how to deal with it when it happens to someone you love. Try searching ""My friend is dating someone terrible, or, Secrets of The Darth Vader Boyfriend"" for additional tips. You are also entitled to draw lines about how *you* are to be treated. ""I love you, and am always happy to see you, but I don't like that your boyfriend \[invades my personal space/is a felon/whatever\] and I don't want to spend time around him.""

It must be a very frustrating and heartbreaking situation to watch play out, but ultimately all you can really do is remind your sister of her own worth and try to be a safe person for her to come to if/when it all goes wrong."
"&gt;shes not racist but thinks itd be better for me to not have to face racial discrimination because of our dating status, and that the bible says not to mix races. 

I mean, she's racist as hell. I wouldn't subject someone I wanted to marry to that."
"Yeah, that made me think that his natural sense of humor is actually mean / annoying / offensive / what have you, and so people just don't like it, but he's convinced himself that it's because they are all just too dumb to get it. That attitude isn't exactly going to endear him to people.

I also got a bad feeling about how he said he always got along much better with much older people. I used to be like that too, but I eventually realized that it wasn't really because I was an old soul or something. It's just that older people are generally more tolerant and patient towards personality quirks, especially towards someone they see as an adolescent who's still trying to find their way."
"You’re in an abusive relationship. That’s why this feels so terrible. I know you’ve put up with this for five years, and you’ll choose yourself to walk away when you’re sick of feeling this way all the time. But don’t delude yourself. Normal, loving partners don’t behave this way. "
She has been fucking your husband for some time. Is she accredited or something? Because I'd report her. 
"Well, if you like her, ask her out. Other than that, don't be surprised if she starts dating someone else when none of you make a move. "
"&gt;   I know that's how long-term relationships are.

Incorrect. That is how long-term relationships are when one or both  of the people in the relationship were putting on a good face during the ""honeymoon period"" in order to draw someone in.

Long term relationships where people were genuine from the start either never get off the ground from the start (because a jerk who shows his/her true colors right out of the gate probably doesn't get a second date), or they last and are stable, because the aspects they show one another 6 months, a year, ten years along is the same as the aspects they showed at the beginning, the things that attracted them to one another in the first place.

Your boyfriend is a jerk:

&gt; ""Can you watch where you're going?""

&gt; He simply replied, ""Oh please.""

&gt; ""Do I cry when I talk to you? Why must you cry?"".

&gt; ""So you don't want to talk about it anymore right? Fine. Your decision.""

All of those are pretty nasty, and not the sorts of things you say to someone whose feelings you care about in the slightest.

The new-relationship smell has worn off, and it's time for you to recognize that it was covering up the scent of something dead and rotting under the driver's seat.

This is who he is; who he had been acting like up until this new behavior started was the face he was putting on to draw you in.  And it worked."
"Have you brought up splitting things less evenly to him? If you have, what was his reaction like?

Also you started dating when you were *fifteen* and he was *twenty*? "
"Lol based on the title I thought you were going base jumping or doing hard drugs. Pocket knife and camping/hiking. Just wow. Your friends sound extremely sheltered and probably can't handle when the power goes out. Unfortunately there's not a whole lot that you can do. Maybe try to encourage them to do some of those things. Bring them car camping, let them use your knife once. The only way for people to get be okay with things outside their comfort zone is for them to do those things. But if they won't even do the first step then there's nothing you can do to change them. Try grey rocking them. I.E if they say you are dangerous say ""Yup so dangerous"" in a sarcastic tone and then don't let them keep the conversation going."

"You've got quite an elephant in the room. And you both know it's there.

Time to mention to him that there's an elephant in the room.

How do you feel about it? If you've already decided that you've forgiven him, that's a great opener. ""Honey, I overheard you talking to Bob about the time you cheated on me. I've thought about it, and forgive you, but I want to talk about it.""

Or if you're not up for forgiveness right now, just bring it up. ""I overheard you, and I know you know that I overheard you. Instead of pretending like it didn't happen, let's talk."""
"On his threads complaining about you, post your advice to him. 
Then watch him squirm."
"Hate to bear bad news, but my advice to you is *run*.

He’s not even pretending to not badmouth you to family in front of you, imagine what he says behind your back. "
"Your wife cleaning it consistently on a weekly basis probably gives you the answer you’re looking for. I’d say leave it be.

I’m extremely sorry for your loss and hope you and your wife find the peace you’re looking for."
Just be prepared for him to guilt trip you and try his hardest to make you stay.
"""went to the pharmacy to grab some Plan B""

Whatever else is going on, don't be weirded out that she didn't want to take random Plan B pills you picked up ""just because."" Plan B isn't like just taking a Tylenol. There can be uncomfortable side effects that last for days or even a month. It's not just a ""pop it and forget about it"" kind of thing."
He got to roll with advantage by being upfront with her and treating her like a person.
"&gt;How do I help him get over this?

You can't. To be honest, it's concerning to me that you're only 3 months in to a relationship and he's crying all night over his pride being dinged. 

This guy has self-esteem issues out the wazoo. That's above your pay grade to fix. If you're going to keep seeing this guy, be prepared for more resentment about your brother. "
"DEFINITELY too early. You need to live close and see eachother a few times a week before you have truly seen each others true nature. Proposing now is a gamble and its very immature of her to have her friends communicate that to you, that's a red flag. Dont do it."
"Even in affluent neighborhoods, there are families who live in filth.  One of my kids wanted to spend the night at a new friend's house and, when I went to meet the parents, they were hoarders with garbage everywhere.  I invited the new friend to spend the night at our place instead.

It is not a wealth thing."
"Have you *witnessed* him asking them, or did he *say* he asked them?"
"Your boyfriend is flirting with other women. 

Also, he was 26 and you were 18 when you started dating? Perhaps he was hoping for some naive who'd ignore his cheating crap. "
"This actually sounds like there's a deeper issue here, than budget. If this was a new relationship and OP had moved in with bf for the first time, that'd be a different story, but they've been together for years and now he starts scrutinizing OPs spending habits, without reasonable reason to?

I don't think this is about how much OP spends or not, it may be time to sit down for a serious conversation about what really is bothering him or what the real problem is."
"WHAA-AAAT? Your path from community college didn't end up at porn?!? How did you manage to avoid the gateway course of Intro to Porn with Low-Income Minorities 101? ;-) Man, Mom sounds terrible. 

I agree with all except for dealing with Dad. He is terrible as well. LAUGHING when your son comes back with a cop from 24 hours of literally wandering around outside in 20° weather in shorts?? He suuuucks. 

Yes, OP, go back to school today. Then transfer to the school near your extended family ASAP. "
"&gt;I don't know where this leaves us. To be frank, if that is truly the way he sees the world, and the way he sees my family especially, I don't know that we are compatible people.

I think his observation that he would be getting more presents if you weren't so charitable was very telling.   He's shown you who he is...you are not compatible.   If you want children, you can't really afford any more time with him, get out now.

And no, there is nothing wrong with what you do.  Lots of people talk but you walk the walk.  Don't let Henry's attitude change you, you just need someone who has similar social views."
Wow... I don't see this getting better between you two without any sort of couples counseling but I wouldn't stay with someone who was so resentful of something I'm passionate about and doesn't harm them in any way.
"Condom detective: Very simple way to tell. If it's a condom from years ago, just check the expiry date on it. If it's out of date then it's from years ago. If it's in date (esp with lots of time left) then it's recent and he's likely lying. "
"If he's not willing to do something uncomfortable to save your marriage, then I would question whether you're willing to live your entire life in discomfort to suit him."
"Don't go back there, ever. Anytime your boyfriend comes back from there tell him to change out of his clothes before he enters your house (he can carry a fresh set of clothes in a ziplock bag or something) and wash those clothes on high heat right away. And run his shoes thought the dryer if he had them on in the house. Not a request, a demand. If he sits on a couch with bedbugs he can bring them to your home.

Heed my words:

YOU. DO. NOT. WANT BED. BUGS.

They are extremely extremely difficult to exterminate. It will risk spreading to other people. The experience of getting bitten will traumatize you to the point that if you ever see crumbs or anything that looks like a bug anywhere especially in your bed you will cry and panic.

If you get infested you might have to move and get rid of most of your possessions.

You are not over reacting, they are unsanitary, selfish and dangerous to your well being and health. And your kids.

I know the change of clothing sounds extreme but I'm saying it to possibly save you or anybody from a world of pain.

I wouldn't feel bad at all for not going over or even inviting them over to risk infesting your home, since they don't appear to have any interest of getting the problem taken care of or being sanitary.

Also, something to tell your boyfriend- if they are that offended then a part of them knows you are right and it hit home even though they don't want to admit it to themselves or change. Being poor is not an excuse as you have said.

Anyway, good luck!"
"I'd cut him some slack on it in this particular case and circumstances. He's probably figured out by now from experience that as many people are weirded out by his situation are okay with it, and that being seen to have a lot of his own money attracts the wrong sort of person. 

If I were you and you do like the guy, I'd  say you should tell him you understand why he needed to lie about it up front and you forgive him, but he needs to be transparent in the future. "
"Yup. I stayed in a relationship for 2 years with a guy who let me believe his mom didn’t like me. In reality he wasn’t serious about me or the relationship and didn’t want me around at family things. I didn’t realize it until I met his cousin at a party and he told me my bf had brought another girl over for thanksgiving. 

Moral of the story: If your SO wants you around, they’ll do whatever it takes to have you around. Run away OP! "
"On top of that telling him nobody wants to hear his sad stories.

&gt;told me nobody wants to hear about any of the depressing shit I had to witness growing up in said country, and finally claimed that the only reason I was writing it was because I just wanted everyone to wallow in my own pity party about not being born in the US.

This is such a rude thing to say.

Also, she seems oddly jealous of OP's fictional characters."
"This was a very revealing episode that you need to think about.  Your boyfriend looks down on people who do manual labor and wants to associate with others who do too.  He interprets everything through that lens. 

Quite honestly, this would be a deal breaker for me.  My parents and I are highly educated.  Both of them had a mixture of educated and manual labor families.  My uncle for example, worked his whole life as a journeyman carpenter and put 4 kids though college.   I would never be associated with someone who thinks he is somehow better than others who do honest work just because it's not white collar.  "
"She shouldn't answer calls to him during dates with you for one thing. That's putting his call at a higher priority than you. This is huge IMO. It either shows that she is completely and utterly naive about her behaviour or she has no respect for you.

He has confessed feelings. They had a sexual fling in the past. He is 'joking' that they should cheat together.

Even if your girlfriend is being will-fully ignorant to keep the friendship afloat, he is not. He is trying hard for her.

I think if you sit her down and lay it all out, the jokes, the constant talking, the interrupting your time together for him, and ask her how she would feel if you were like this with another female. She can't be ignorant that she doesn't see it when it's all laid out in front of her. 

You are completely valid in being uncomfortable with some guy trying it on with your girlfriend. "
"Why the everloving fucknuts would you stay with a guy who preemptively torched his family’s opinion of you? And then *sulked* when you didn’t want to spend a holiday with said family who now thinks poorly of you? 

Girl. Stop wasting your time. "
"The bigger question is: why are you staying with this dude who cheated on you? Have you two rebuilt the trust he’s broken to make this relationship work? It doesn’t sound like he’s actually supporting you through this pregnancy. Don’t stay with him “for the baby.”

He can coparent without being your boyfriend. And if he doesn’t want to coparent, he can pay child support. "
"If you want to invest time in couples counseling it's possible a therapist would be a good third person to help him understand what's at stake here. As you described it you made a clear demand, it doesn't seem unreasonable in light of the admitted transgression, and he's being obtuse about your feelings or ignoring them. I don't think you're really in the wrong as you have described it."
"So your boyfriend is into his co-worker's girl friend and is an abusive jerk to boot.   Since you don't live together, making a clean break should be easier that it would otherwise."
"If its at all feasible and you are willing to do it I would just drive separately. That way you can enjoy thanksgiving with your mom and new bf but still stop by your late husbands family celebration. From your post this is the first holiday without him so I think it would mean a lot for you to come. 

Also do not bring the new guy, I wouldn't even ask MIL if its cool to bring him. This is one of those situations where people are going to be a little raw and even if they thinks its cool before hand may not take it well as its happening. So to sum up go if you can but just have the new bf drive himself. "
"That’s awesome!! My husband and I just  started playing D&amp;D together a few months ago and love it! 
Sorry your group got stupid, but hopefully now that you are a couple, they’ll get over themselves. 
Maybe not playing characters that are a “couple” also will help keep them more friendly. And if not, I hope you guys find another group of good people. Maybe more couples... haha. "
"Sit him down, show him the video and then let him talk. Don't say anything and just let him talk. "
"This seems like a perfectly concise way to say it. I don't want him to think I'm upset about it and I don't have any personal animosity toward her, but I personally just am not at that point in my grief to accept her into my life. 

I like adding that I will let him know when I'm ready, as it sets a clear expectation. Then I can bring her up later down the road when I'm ready.

Also, thank you &lt;3"
"My mom died 2 years ago and my dad starting dating someone after aprx 6 months. 

From talking to my Dad both before and after he officially told us he was dating I’ve come to realize that his version of dating is very different to the dating that I did before I met my husband. My parents were together for 30+ years and prior to moving in with my mom my dad lived at home with his mom. When my mom died my dad was LONELY. Like, really, really lonely. His girlfriend is also recently bereaved widow. They’re both lonely people who are just a bit less lonely because they’re dating. 

I know it’s weird. But try to remember that whatever happens with your dad’s new girlfriend he is not trying to replace your mom. Chances are that like my Dad he’s just trying to alleviate a little bit of the loneliness that comes from suddenly losing the one person he could always rely on to be there for him. And from a purely selfish standpoint I worry a lot less about my dad than I did before he found someone- and for that I’m very grateful to his girlfriend. "
"When you’re not invited, what does you bf do? does he just.... go without you? Does he just ignore that you’re not invited?
Like he’s obviously not that bothered by it if he’s never questioned it, or their motives; never asked for you to be included, never said “sure, me and SoDoneLolllll cant wait to see you there!”.

You know what I would do if my parents came to visit me but refused to see my partner? I would refuse to see my parents. 
You know what I would do if my family took a trip and included all SO’s except mine? I would refuse to go on the trip.

You bf seems like he doesn’t want to include you in his family, to be honest.
Unless you’ve heard directly from family members themselves, and not from your bf acting as a “messenger”...."
"&gt;I don't want him to think I don't ever want him to touch me

OP, there is an enormous difference between, ""I actually want to pay attention to the movie, let's leave the make-out session to afterwards"" and ""I don't want you to ever touch me again/I don't like you!"" And please **trust me** when I say that 99% of people can make that distinction.

If your boyfriend hears you say, ""I want to watch the movie, we can make-out later"" and responds with something like:

* ""But I thought you liked making out with me! Don't you like making out with me? Don't you like it when I touch you?""
* ""Fine, I'll never touch you again!"" and sulks on the far end of the couch.
* ""Aww, I'm such a bad boyfriend! I guess you must hate it when I touch you or kiss you.""
* ""You're just so hot babe, I can't resist!""
* Touching and kissing you anyway

Then he is being **manipulative.** Unless he's the kind of 25-year-old that has never had a girlfriend before, he knows exactly what you mean when you say, ""Can we make out later instead of now?"" and is ignoring your needs anyway, whilst pretending he just doesn't understand what you're saying so you will instead put up with him overriding your boundaries.

And honestly, in light of him ignoring your *very* clear body language, the age difference between the two of you is concerning. It makes me wonder if he's dating you purely because he knows a 19-year-old is less likely to enforce boundaries than someone closer to his age is.

Next time you put on a movie and he tries to kiss/touch you, say, ""Not now, I want to watch the movie."" He should only need to be told **once.** If he pretends he doesn't understand, then he is not someone you can trust. A partner should always respect your boundaries, even if it means not getting to kiss or touch you for a period of time. You are his girlfriend, not his fleshlight. You're allowed to not want to be touched all the time. "
"Why are you beating yourself up for looking at his comment history? It's a public forum and he's aware you know his username, you didn't snoop. He could have deleted his nasty comment if he didn't want you to see it.

As to the issue at hand, you're going to have to talk it out with him. Say you saw the comment and that it hurt, being reminded of mean things people have said to you. Ask him why he would say that and why he would then date you. Maybe he realized he was a jackass and changed his ways. We can hope! But it's going to eat you alive if you don't ask him."
You are not overreacting. He is being inappropriate. Ask him how he would feel if you had some guy he didn't know over when he wasn't home.
"The thing is, he knows I'm really modest and I'd rather joke around with people and have a laugh than try and play up my accomplishments. 

Really the only time I try and show off my knowledge or accomplishments is in job interviews and networking events, and that definitely takes effort, it doesn't come naturally to me. It feels draining to have to sell a perfect image of myself, and I thought my boyfriend knew that about me.."
"I'm a little confused. Your partner does not celebrate special events like birthdays and holidays and is now upset that you don't want to celebrate them either?

Also, communication here is going to be key and you're going to be working on an uphill battle. Since you've never expressed dissatisfaction before, it's going to seem to come out of nowhere that he finds you actually are upset. Things can only change if people know there's a problem."

"If you have a history of disordered eating, dating someone who makes disparaging comments on your physical appearance should be a line in the sand “Nope.” He’s got a history of repeatedly saying things you perceive as negative and a history of *not stopping* saying them when you ask. 

It doesn’t matter if it’s cluelessness, cruel, a joke, or even a good natured best effort: his words and actions impact you negatively and he hasn’t stopped.

There’s millions of men in the world: why saddle yourself with someone who isn’t willing to be the best version of themselves for you *especially* when the version of themselves they’re offering you is toxic? "
"You're not ready to be engaged.  And that's okay.

My recommendation would be that you not get engaged until the two of you are done with school and living in the same area.

What you should tell her is something along the lines of, ""Honey, I feel like you want me to propose for Christmas.  And I don't want you to be disappointed.  I'm not ready to get engaged.  I think we should wait until we live in the same area (or whatever goal of your choosing) before we start planning a wedding.""

Also, whatever you do, do NOT buy her anything in a jewelry box for Christmas.  A bix of earrings looks the same as a ring box.  Don't make that mistake."
"If you cannot have an upfront conversation about birth control, you are not in a position to have unprotected sex. "
"What a childish, manipulative jerk. He is the one spoiling this trip. A normal person would laugh off the key thing, call their partner a dummy and then enjoy the trip! As for the ex-gf sending him messages thing, that sounds like a veiled threat of cheating to me. Think carefully about staying with this guy OP. Life is too short for constant drama."
[deleted]
I... I guess he doesn’t want to tell you that he wants to move? I guess.
"OK, you've been together three years. Your next move depends on where you want this relationship to go. Are you considering whether you would marry your boyfriend one day? If you are, you need to start insisting that he stand up for you. If you aren't invited to family outings, he should be telling them, ""No thanks, I'm going to stay with SoDoneLolllllll."" Honestly, don't get engaged if he won't address this. Set a firm boundary.

If you weren't thinking longer term with him, then I would downgrade whatever level you set this relationship at. He's treating you more like a casual thing than like a person he wants to merge his life with. If that's ok with you and you see him as casual as well, then stop looking to go on family outings and start making your own plans without him. Casual relationships are fine!

Ask yourself how long you are willing to continue like this if nothing changes. You sound like you are at the point where it's not ok anymore. So you can either change how you view the relationship, set boundaries in this relationship, or find a new relationship."
"There is a difference between squalor and poverty. They are living in squalor. 

This is something your boyfriend is just going to have to deal with. Otherwise you might not be right for each other. "
"Also, “dumbing yourself down” makes me feel like you just don’t understand social cues that well and come off weirdly to people. "
"That is a good idea about making a formal set of rules about what behavior will result in not being invited to parties, and even what behavior would warrant a report to the school administration or the police. 

We really haven't publicly addressed issues of harassment or assault in our sport, and I think we should.

Unfortunately it's something that's way too widespread; I Know of another college fencing club that has a literal rapist in its club leadership. It's been reported to the school, and to the police, and neither have done shit about it... "
You pushed back and she dropped it. Keep that up. No is a complete sentence. 
"There’s no way for you to explain this so that she understands and accepts it: she’s not that kind of person. I’m sorry. 

I’d try to move out and then go no or very low contact. "
"So, the first thing is probably to identify a different hotline you could volunteer with, and then speak privately to your contacts at your current hotline and ask if they are willing to serve as references etc. Get that set up so that you have a way to continue giving back--obviously this is important to you, so you need to find a way to continue doing that work.

Then I'd talk to whoever your usual manager is (unless it's this woman), and say that you need to resign as a volunteer, you have the utmost respect for the organization and you have really loved your time there, but that the new volunteer coordinator is the woman who bullied you in HS, and even if she's changed as a person, you can't work under someone who used to bully you.

You are not bluffing when you say this, btw. Your plan is to leave. They will not fire an employee because of a volunteer's unwillingness to work with her. You have to look out for yourself here. She may well have changed for the better, but that doesn't mean you need to be around her at all. I'm so sorry, but I think the best possible thing for your own mental health is to find a new organization to dedicate your time and energy to."
"Yes, straight up tell him. Gently put your hand between the two of you/lightly push him away and say ""Maybe later, I want to watch the movie!"" with a smile. If you don't feel comfortable speaking up like that in your relationship it's a problem. "

"Ever seen Jerry McGuire? This reminded me of the line “SHOW ME THE MONEY!”

Seriously, where’s it all going? 400000 per year. $36000 for his student loans. $12000 for your parents. Housing and Costco. And other bills. And you’re left after taxes with $200000? 

Have you seen the accounts?

I think you need to see a financial planner and a marriage counselor. Make a plan to pay off his student loans and repay your parents. Don’t let his neuroticism set you up for financial or family failure. "
"Sounds like your BF needs new friends. He's grow up and they want to keep him in the same place.

&gt; Last night, his roommate took the parking pass out of my car for his girl to park there, and I got a ticket. My boyfriend offered to pay for it -

Nope. Your BF didn't handle this right.

He should have gotten pissed at his roommate for treating you unfairly and demanded that the roommate pay for the ticket. This sort of things show a complete lack of respect toward you from the roommate and your BF should have called him out for it.

Oh, and you need to start locking your car doors. 

---

Stop trying to figure out why the hate you.

Because of you, your BF changed, for the better it sounds like. This means that they are loosing him as a friend. They probably also don't like the implication that they are losers, which is why he has stopped hanging out with them.

Your BF needs to start setting boundaries. Yes, he can still be friends with them, but he can't let them act like douchebags around you. His job is not to make everyone happy, it is to make sure that everyone acts like a decent human being. "
Seconding this. I was my sorority’s president in college. When someone was put on “social probation” they had a meeting with the exec board as to why they weren’t going to be allowed to attend mixers and the like. It helped to get members to follow rules and everyone knew the expectations. 
Go to a lawyer yesterday and tell them about your friend. Ask your lawyer for advice on how to best end the friendship while protecting yourself legally. Better to pay a few hundred dollars now than be screwed out the ass for thousands later.
"Your club needs to come up with an official transparent process and policy for dealing with bad behavior. This policy needs to be communicated to all club members and then the officers enforce it. 


While you probably have honest good intentions thisbpaves the way for officers to exclude club members with no accountability as to why. 


If this was a purely social party there’s no problem with your decision but since this is a club open to membership you need an agreed upon protocol. "
"According to T. S. Eliot, a cat must have three different names. 

One name that the family gives it for everyday use, one name that is confounding to the human ear, and one name that only the cat knows and will never share with anyone.

""When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
His ineffable effable
Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular Name.""

So you just call those cats whatever you like."
"Does this woman life coach other people? Because you need to leave reviews online of her behavior.

""I don't recommend anyone use her services. She convinced me my husband and I weren't compatible, then she swooped in to date him. Gross."""
I will definitely text her regularly.  She lives an hour away but I will do what I can to see her more often.
"I understand your worry and concern but we are both much older than your son. 

From his perspective he’s in love, she’s amazing, their son (that’s how he now sees it) are going to be a cute family with a white picket fence and will grow old together. 

Now we all know this is unrealistic and statistically unlikely. But he doesn’t or doesn’t want to know. 

You have two choices:

* Sit him down and air your grievances and concerns. This will likely result in low to no contract from your son, plus it gives her a lot of ammunition to isolate him further. Not my recommend approach. 

* 100% unwavering support from you and your husband. 
Your daughter has a different relationship with him, as she should as a sibling. So she can continue on with her opinions. 

I’m serious, you and your husband fake it. 

Start planning a fortnightly dinner with her and her son. Make a big deal out of it being a family dinner. 
Engage him to tell you about his plans, offer support and encouragement. 
Kids have lots of stuff going on, you want to go to each and every concert, school assembly, anything and everything you are realistically able to. 
Ask him now about Christmas, when (not if or will) they be joining you? 
You said she only speaks to your son or her son. Invite them all over, ask your daughter to watch her son for a minute. Then you, husband, your son and this woman have a quick chat. Something like “we know how hard it can be joining a new group of people. We love our son and he loves you and your boy so that’s enough for us. Welcome to the family” 
Make your son see how much effort you’re putting in! 
Ask him for her favorite foods and make a big show of having them. 

Your son and husband could also have a man to man chat about being married and having kids. Not in a lecture way, more in a “you’ve found yourself a woman you want to marry, here’s my sage advice on how it works.” If your husband can weave it in a bit about planning for kids. Yes they are joy but they’re also hard work and expensive and change the landscape of a relationship. Plus their older son might not react the way they think he will. 

Essentially kill her with kindness, never say a bad word about her unless you are 100% sure your son can’t hear you. Perhaps start scheduling coffee dates with your husband so you can let it all out. 

Your goal here is to support your son, don’t give her anything that she can twist to isolate him. You want communication open. 
When he does complain about her, react appropriately not from fear of her using him, the same way you would react if you actually liked this woman.

"I think you are going to have to lovingly give your GF a reality check.

* she hasn't put in the time necessary to make these friendships close enough for them to do that for her.
* 15 people in 1 room sounds like a nightmare.

---

Now, for your bit in this.

You know your GF is an introvert. Have you tried more intimate hangout with friends. You don't have to do giant group things every fucking time. She might be more willing to do things if it was 1-3 people at a shot. Maybe invite a very small group over for dinner every other week.

Help her make closer friends."
It seems like you’re mainly put off by her lack of hygiene and nobody can blame you for that. I think it’s time you had a courageous conversation with her and decide together what to do when your lifestyles don’t align. 
"Honestly, I would have probably been concerned about my own clothes sitting anywhere in that house, too..."
"&gt; Despite my anger I want to take the high ground. How do I call her out and end our friendship without being or sounding like a huge asshole?

You just...stop reaching out to her. She hasn't made any attempt to reach out to you, so why should you embarass yourself with ""officially"" ending the friendship when *she already has*?

There is no way for you to take the high ground because there is no ground to take at all. So stop chasing her. Chasing her down so you can get the last word in is still chasing her. So put your happy memories of her away in a box somewhere, and move on with your life."
"Nothing here suggests he’s fetishising you, just sharing (albeit clumsily) what he is into. Talk to him about his fetish (and your fears) and take it from there."
"Lmao even if you weren’t donating to causes, Henry is not entitled to your money. He sounds like a selfish asshole. I would never in a million years think what he said to you was in the least bit okay.

Nah it's like keeping a diary. Not weird. It's only weird if u write where they were at certain times etc 
"So people don't like you.  Who cares.  People don't have to like their coworkers.  Adult life isn't high school.

BUT...it sounds like you actually would do well to go back to therapy and focus on short term social skill training.  Because based on your post you still are missing some basic social skills.  You can be yourself without being an asshole or dumbing down and being a mute.  Learn how to be authentic while still appropriate."
Jealousy is immediately where my mind went when I was reading the original post.

"Are there obvious differences like race/religion/money status?

If no, the problem is your boyfriend allowing this to be acceptable. Because they are treating you differently. It’s a boyfriend problem first though because if he thinks it’s no big deal, then you can’t do anything about them.

Tell him again in no uncertain terms that is 10000 percent unfair/disrespectful to treat you so differently and the fact he can’t see that is really uncool"
"It’s not that he doesn’t celebrate special events. He just doesn’t want to do any work for special events. According to the OP, he’s perfectly happy to receive gifts on Christmas. He just doesn’t buy them for OP. I’m sure his birthday is no different. 

I could be overthinking this, but perhaps his current opposition to her *agreement* with his decision not to celebrate is rooted in the fact that he’ll finally be treated the same way he treats OP. And he’s not so keen on how that feels. Ironic. "
"Unrelated, but please please keep an open mind about who she is and your relationship, considering she is showing you new data points about herself. 

Just like you should never jump straight to ""break up"", you should ALSO never, ever jump straight to ""I'm going to stick with this relationship no matter what."" Both are dangerous thoughts, and you should be revising your relationship decision every time you get significant new information about who your partner is.

This is one of those times when she is showing you a ""new her"". This new her apparently doesn't respect what you do, and is potentially jealous of any success you could have.

If she's able to eventually realize that she IS jealous of your success and apologize for behaving spitefully, there's hope and great potential for your future.

But if she sticks to her views, you really, really need to consider. Being in a relationship with someone who views you innately as ""less than"" for WHATEVER reason, will become a horrible relationship for you. It will turn into an eventual repeat of the situation with your family, where you will feel unsupported and downtrodden. It will take a toll on your self esteem.

We are always learning about our partners. And you need to be ready to make correct decisions on NEW information and not rely too heavily on old information or past behaviors.

"He's posting things to a public forum, his profile isn't private. I hardly see how you invaded his privacy unless you went snooping on his phone/laptop for it. And ultimately while that would be wrong it doesn't change what he posted.  ""I saw what you posted about me on Reddit. We're done. Don't contact me again."" "
"Genius, this is perfect. Thank you. "
"Here's what you can do for now: Continue living on your own. Make sure you're responsible with your own finances, and that your work and studies don't suffer from whatever you do in your free time. 

In other words, take care of your own life in a responsible way. 

Now, if that is all going ok, there's nothing wrong with dating an immature guy, as long as it's still fun enough for you. You're only 18, you don't need to think about settling down yet. 

BUT DON'T: move in with him, pay for everything, let him distract you from your responsibilities, get pregnant. Basically, right now he sounds like a guy it might be fun to hang around with, but you can't rely on him as a partner. 

There's no guarantee this one will grow up to be any better than he is right now. Don't keep dating him in the hopes he grows up, he might never do that. Only stay together if he's good enough as he is right now. "
"Tell Dylan not to call you unless he wants to reach you or it is an emergency. 

Also tell your husband to find a less clingy friend lol"
Incompatible.
You need to call CPS and report all of this. Protect those kids. They don’t deserve it. 
"Agreed.

The recommendations in the last post were bizarre. This is absolutely the right way to deal with it. It's a good idea to message someone (in this situation), even if you don't really know them. Do you owe them anything? No, but it's about not being a shitty person."
When he says it again I suggest saying “ Are you saying I should be grateful that you didn’t rape me?”
"I would not stay in a 6-bed hotel room/suite with 14 other people for my *husband*, much less a girlfriend of a friend. I wouldn't do it for Jesus, I wouldn't do it for Santa Claus, I wouldn't do it for fucking Beyonce. Just...no.  

Not that that's super relevant to OPs question, but I feel like part of her problem is that she's picked a literal hellscape for a birthday party - I bet if OP suggested a local bar night or bowling or something, she'd have a great little birthday shindig."
If she's willing to lose you because you can't pay for a big party is she really someone you want to marry? The wedding is one day. Marriage is your whole life. She should be supportive your bettering yourself so you can have a good life in the future. 
"""Hey, we need to talk about you cheating on me."" See where this conversation takes you."

Tell her that you are going to control cat care and feeding from now on. Keep the food supply in your room. 
"If Alan is really a cool guy, maybe he could either hang out at your parents for an hour or two, or he could drop you off at the MIL's house, then take the car and go to a movie.

If I put myself in his shoes, I don't think I'd even bat an eye at a request like that as long as I have a car so I'm not stuck somewhere waiting for you."
Your boyfriend wants to fuck Kim.
"Your mom is gonna have to figure out how to visit you guys or have you guys visit without your dad's involvement (and without your help too). She's an adult and that's on her at some level. Your dad has made it very clear with his actions that he doesn't care at all about your family and you should stop trying to have a relationship with him IMO beyond basic civility.

There is nothing you can do to ""fix"" this situation and IMO, it's your mom's responsibility to figure out things between her and your dad if she needs him to drive her to you guys. Or she needs to figure out a way to visit on her own. Honestly, your parents' marriage doesn't sound very healthy and IMO, a lot of problems would be solved if your mom got away from your dad."

"This is gonna sound weird but I actually agree with your last point a lot-- I just haven't really mentioned it to anyone because I was kinda hoping she was joking, but given everything else that's happened she probably wasn't. I've actually had to edit out names and pronouns from my scripts before showing her because she would get insanely angry when I created female main characters or female love interests of a male main character, and it would derail her completely from giving me actual criticism/opinions to hounding me on why I was fantasizing about women who weren't her. We actually had a pretty big blowout once when earlier on I sent her a script with a male and female main character, and asked her if I should make them love interests. Apparently because the male character shared a minor characteristic with me (favorite food), I was obviously inserting myself into his character and fantasizing about getting with the female main character. "
"Going forward, beyond your husband, you are going to have to get rid of this ""friend"". There's no way to hide what you know and still stay sane. Given that, right now you are going to need a lawyer on standby and a counselor to get you through this. "
"Okay so, I have the same problem. If the noise from your fart also comes from your butt (so when you pull your cheeks apart they're silent), all you need to do is wear pants that go into your crack a bit so this silences them. Just try it on your own and see if it works.
I know this advice is really awkward to give, but I have had this problem for so long and felt so relieved the solution was so simple, so I hope this helps."
"Dude screamed “look what you did” at a 2 year old. 

His first attempts were good. He needs to be the adult and LEAVE THE ROOM when he feels himself peak like this. That’s it. I have a 3 year old and anxiety that presents as rage. I have had to learn to walk the heck away when he gets physical or generally....shitty. 

He’s not entitled to have tantrums AT his toddler or around her this way. He needs counseling. Now, I would maybe suggest anger management. But here’s the thing: he doesn’t act remorseful afterwards, he acts like everyone else’s feelings are irrational. That’s not the mindset of someone who has anger management issues. That is an abuser mindset. “I get to react to my feelings however I want. Everyone else must practice perfect management of their emotions lest they be illogical.” This is *entitlement* and that’s hardest to treat. 

Make it clear your marriage depends on counseling, together and individually. This isn’t okay. People don’t do this to their kids. He needs help. He’s yelling at his toddler to an extreme. And it’s on him to get it. 

You have outlined the dynamics of an abuser. Of course he isn’t like this 24/7 or no one would stay with abusers. But this continues. And now there is a child. He has to manage it. Now. "
Change your relationship status instead. 
"You need to talk to her about this pronto. If her friends are sending messages about rings and all that, you're neck deep in a ""get married"" campaign which means she fully expects you to propose during Christmas. Front run this now. Talk to her now about the timeline you have in mind for your relationship. Moving in the direction of marriage is a big step and both of you need to be on the same page. Do not let her assume that you're going to propose during Christmas if you don't plan to. She already has her friends involved which means word will spread. People will hear about it beforehand, and if it doesn't happen, you're going to have a crying, devastated, embarrassed mess on your hands.

At her parent's house.
During the holidays.

Deal with this now.
Talk to her immediately."
"That's what I was thinking. I'm like, but they already have names..."
"He's obviously got issues surrounding family. 

Have you ever asked him if he's comfortable around them and how it makes him feel to be around them? Asked him why he seems so hesitant to spend time with them?

What is he doing today instead? Is he spending the holiday alone? Because that's kind of sad. 

Ultimately, yes, you need to communicate to him that it hurts you not to have your partner be involved in your family stuff and that it may be a dealbreaker long term.

But first I think you should try and help him, maybe suggest therapy, because he seems to be struggling with this.

Today isn't the time to have these conversations. Don't spend today angrily texting him and whatnot. Enjoy the holiday with your family. Tell him you'll bring him a plate of leftovers. But when it's over tomorrow, sit him down and tell him you need to talk about his involvement with your family. Ask him why he has a hard time being involved with your family, tell him how it hurts you and how it will affect your relationship long term, and ask him how you can work together to solve this in a way that makes both of you happy."
"The cat is out of the bag, it would be very cruel to refuse to discuss this now that she's read the notebook.

Time to pull the bandaid off. Your idea that she is too overloaded to deal with your needs in the relationship is a surefire way to ruin the relationship. Maybe downplay some of your criticisms of her priorities or perfectionism, but you should clearly articulate what you need from her. "
"Various useless suggestions:

* Work on the phobia, take him pseudo-driving:  golf carts, go-karts, ATV's, snowmobiles, car in empty wide open parking lot.

* Subscribe him to development progress / news items about Google's self-driving cars, promise to get him one of those as soon as they're available commercially.

* Get him a car, and hire him a driver; there's gotta be some teenage kid looking for some extra cash / summer job in the area.

* However much you spend on gas per week, he can spend on rides.  And stop giving him rides at all.

* Divorce.  You're not right for each other.

* Sell the car, and *both of you* uber / taxi it all the time.

* Sell the car, get a motorcycle, become a biker chick, give him rides on that.

* Advanced driving courses for you; car with manual transmission and rear wheel drive so you can brake/turn, drift, and race."
"You need to leave the relationship. If he choked you- even if it were ONCE- let alone TWICE, LEAVE!!!

A common response for abusers when you say that they are abusive is that “we are both abusive” or “you’re abusive too”.  He is trying to normalize the behavior. 

His comment about saying girls don’t fight when they’re younger which in turn means they’re not used to physically fighting is him trying to normalize his abusive behavior. 

A verbal disagreement in a marriage should NEVER. EVER. EVER. lead to physical contact. 

I’ve heard it several times from my very abusive ex. It started with him throwing things at me playfully, then harder, then hitting, then holding a knife to my throat. It was almost too late for me to leave, because I kept brushing off each incident. He kept normalizing his abusive behavior. 

Please, reach out to someone. Find a safe place. This is NOT something to downplay. It’s serious. Don’t brush it off or doubt yourself.

"I think you are correct, and I think that's what your manager meant.

I also think that when Tom says rude things about other people you know, he is trying to sucker you into agreeing or adding on, at which point he tells the person he was slanging that you said whatever the thing was.

The most important thing with people like this is to GRADUALLY cut back your interactions, and also to put them on an information diet. As far as they are concerned, only good things happen to you, you have only great coworkers, and you have a wonderful relationship with your manager, who is awesome. When they go negative, you push back gently once (""That isn't the John/Betty I know!"" ""That just doesn't seem correct to me"" ""No, I just don't agree"") and then end the call.

You want to do it very slowly because you don't want to make yourself his next victim. You want to definitely push back so that he can't say ""I said X about John and u/laitdepeche agreed"". You want to disengage over time because being connected with this guy will eventually RUIN your professional reputation.

"Whether or not you have an eating disorder, your bf is an idiot. Humiliating someone over how much they eat, their weight, and their health is abusive.  Lose the real dead weight and drop the bf.

You need to get a handle on your depression and your weight - your mental and physical health matter. The notion that things will improve if you move in together seems unrealistically optimistic. 

You have to be responsible for your health. You have to want to take care of yourself for YOU.

Nah, gal, probably not. The likelihood that these five guys are always going to be in his life? Nah. Maybe a few. Hopefully the few that grow up and adult. But why would he be living in a share house with his five besties at 30yo? He won't. Y'all will move in together at some point, and you won't have to deal with the Mean Boys.

"I feel like everyone's glossing over the fact that he was recently switched to graveyard shift. 

Have you ever worked graveyard? It's not, ""Oh I'm a little tired"" it's ""I literally do not feel like a human being anymore."" And you still have all the responsibilities of a day-shift person. You still have errands to run, food to cook, a house to clean, kids to take care of, relationships to keep, etc. 

When I worked graveyard not only did my sex drive completely disappear but I wasn't able to enjoy any hobbies, I didn't want to hang out with friends, and I barely had the mental energy to feed myself. 

It makes you feel disassociated from the world. Everyone is starting their day when you're ending it. When you're coming home from your shift between 5-7am -- you see people on their morning run. It's like you aren't part of society anymore you're an outsider watching a movie about ""real life"". 

I know he's not on night shift anymore but it takes awhile to readjust. Between his schedule changes, the prospect of being a new father, work, and two kids he may just be burned out a bit. It happens in long-term relationships. 

I don't think the condom wrapper is suspicious at all. There are a lot more obvious signs of cheating. Is he hiding his phone all the time? Did he take a sudden interest in improving his physical appearance? Does he suddenly have to leave at odd hours? Is he coming home at night (or in the day time)? Besides, if he was actually having an affair there's no way he'd leave the condom wrapper in his pocket. Who puts a condom wrapper in their pocket after they have sex? That just makes no sense.

Remember, you're making a huge step in your relationship too. You're recently married and about to have a baby! Sometimes our brains are really good at convincing us it's ""Too good to be true"" so we start subconsciously looking for ways to sabotage the relationship. Maybe this big change is kind of dredging up a lot of those old emotions and fears from your ex, ""How did I not know he was cheating on me!"" so you're subconsciously trying to ""prove yourself right"" with your husband. 

It's not uncommon to subconsciously seek closure from old relationships with new partners. It's a weird kind of vindication -- like if you catch your husband cheating, it proves you *are* vigilant and maybe you feel that will absolve you of any lingering guilt you may feel for not noticing your ex-husband's infidelity. Sort of a ""fool me once"" perspective. 

I think you should just hang in there until the baby is born and try not to project your past experience onto him. He's not your ex-husband. Your husband loves you, he loves your children, and he's excited about being a dad. That's not the hallmark of a person who is looking for a way out. Sex drive ebbs and flows -- especially under stress -- and it's not always easy to pinpoint exactly *why* you don't feel sexually excited because, it's typically the last thing on your mind so you're just not really thinking about it. 

I would just focus on keeping the *romance* alive and focus a little less on the sex aspect for right now. No one likes to feel pressured to have sex when they don't feel like it so I wouldn't push to hard on that front. Arrange a babysitter and go on a romantic date night (or weekend if you can). Take a bath together, cuddle and watch a movie, go on a walk and hold hands -- you can be intimate and romantic without having sex. Give it a little time and I'd say in 4-6 months if nothing's changed and you're not happy then schedule an appointment with a couple's counselor. 

I really do think this is just a lot of stress hitting him at once and after things settle down you guys will get back into your normal rhythm. "
"Encourage your husband to hang out one on one with Dave more and you should stop hanging out with Beth. Claim you’re too busy to do more couples things.

You’re letting guilt rule your life when you have zero to feel guilty about. Learn to say no. Learn to sit back and let him drink water without feeling obligated to pay for his drinks. Learn to tell him that it’s “stay home and watch Netflix” night because you can’t afford a night out, and if he wants to go out for drinks and dinner and who knows what, then HE can come up with the funds to do it, because the Jellyfish392 bank is officially closed for business.

"Why make your girlfriend go through that and ris it blowing up? If your mom can't be polite and respectful to your serious girlfriend, why go at all? I would stay home and enjoy a nice meal with my girlfriend. "
"You're right.

Dump him already.

Not because he has a crush on someone else. That kind of thing happens. But because at 30 years old he is not mature enough to handle the fact he has a crush on someone else.

He is acting like a 15 year old. Holy shit."
"I used to be insecure like that.  My boyfriend at the time said ""if you think I am SUCH a great guy...why do you doubt my ability to pick a good partner for myself?  I picked you because I think you are good for me.  Please stop criticizing yourself, the person I love.  I wouldn't let anyone else talk about you that way, so I sure as hell won't let YOU talk about yourself that way"".

Therapy OP.  Therapy is key."

"My dad is very old-school, never curses in front of a lady, kind of guy. So when I told him I was divorcing my husband, he told me to let him know what it was going to cost so he could help pay for it. In his words, ""The faster we get that prick out of our lives, the better."""
"I don't know if this helps, but I think you should go for it with John.

Sam wouldn't be angry, you said so yourself.  I know Sam wouldn't want you to put the rest of your life on a shelf for him.  Getting together with John now in no way dishonors Sam's memory.

"I'm very happy for you. You learned an important lesson earlier in life than a lot of women I know. Congratulations on not wasting more time on an unfulfilling relationship. I think very often all you need to do to be happier is lose the dead weight and make space for the good stuff.  
Keep on keeping on :)"
"I mean she's not the one tearing the group apart, they are with their jealousy and the way they're acting. There's no simple way to fix it either. They have to own their own shitty behavior.

"&gt;it's possible she's cleaned up her act since high school

I was going to say this because people can change a lot from high school to their mid-twenties. Honestly, I think there is a third option other than the one you laid out which is try to use this as an opportunity to improve your own mental wellness by seeing if you can't get some closure. Forgiveness is incredibly tough, so I wouldn't blame you for saying ""Fuck that"" but it could be such a healing moment if you were able to let her know how much she hurt you and seek to forgive her if she is willing to apologize and show remorse.

&gt; Do you think it is possible he hired her for life coach services during this difficult time?

&gt; I understand that relationships and feelings happen

&gt; I don’t want to make up ugly stories about them in my head

**Your ex-husband is dating the decade-younger woman who convinced you to divorce him.**

This situation is so messed up for multiple reasons. Whether or not it was intentional, she’s done something so wildly unethical here that it should exclude her from giving life advice to *anyone* in a professional capacity.

You’re doing a disservice to yourself and to anyone who might consider hiring this woman in the future, if you don’t either report her (if there’s some accreditation board for her profession) or at least leave a warning review.

Others deserve to know that the person they’re hiring for life advice has done something so disgustingly unethical to a client’s relationship."
"Sounds like my mom. When I told her I was transferring, she threatened to force me to work 40 hours a week in the factory she worked at so I’d see what my future would look like. 

When I refused, she threatened to kick me out because she didn’t want my “lazy, bratty ass” near her. 

I transferred anyway. It’s your life. You’re not living for her, you’re living for you. Do what makes you feel good. "
"Learned the very hard way, kids don't like to talk. They don't wanna ""sit down and discuss things like reasonable adults."" They just don't. They're in a limbo where the world wants them to grow up (and they want to grow up too) but they still have (the lions share, I'm) feelings of just wanting to be stupid and do whatever they want without anyone questioning or teaching them anything about their decisions.

It gets tiresome. It gets on your nerves. It hurts your feelings. But in the end, you are the adult here. You're the grown up. So it's your job to literally say to her ""Hey. I love you. I hate that you've decided not to talk to me for the last 3 days. When you're ready to start talking, I'm here. I'll always he here. The decision you've made not to talk to me isn't a good one and I hope you rethink it soon."" and just let it be.

If another day or two goes by and she's still being petty and stupid (all kids are from time to time), then is the time for you to say"" k. It's benn 5 days. This is dumb and we're not doing it anymore. Pick where you want to go for dinner and we're going to go and talk about it.""

No raised voices, no hurt feelings, no petty stupidity from you - just dad +logic +reason +love. And let her know ""we're not EVER going to do the cold shoulder/silent treatment thing in this house again."" Talk to her honestly about why you dislike bullying and you hope she won't be a bully. APOLOGIZE to her for jumping on her about the buckets.

Teach her that apologizing isn't just for kids, that adults make mistakes, too. Teach her what eating crow really is by doing it then and there. If you wanna be her dad AND eventually her friend, you gotta start by showing her you can be.

Good luck. "

"not who you're asking, but I got the same impression from the you saying you feel that you need to ""dumb yourself down"" to get people to like you 

Getting people to like you doesn't mean being ""dumber""- there are are very well educated people in my office who are kind, polite, smile and are generally well liked. I feel you might need to get out of this mindset to make progress in this. "
"As you say, you have to get out.

""I'm feeling rapey"" is quite possibly a veiled threat, especially considering that it came from a person with a history of violent outbursts and who has expressed sexual frustration *and* propositioned you.

You need to get out *now*; find a couch to surf on if necessary.

It *could* all be a (very poor) attempt to be funny.  But it's not worth finding out that you're wrong."

"Your husband needs to start being blunt and firm with this woman.

When she tries to touch him or his hair: “Don’t touch me.” 
“Stop that, you’re making me uncomfortable.” 
“That’s inappropriate, stop touching me.” 
“Keep your hands to yourself.”

When she calls him outside of work hours, especially at an unreasonable time of night, send her straight to voicemail. Don’t even pick it up. If he *has* to pick up for work reasons then he needs to get comfortable with interrupting her after it’s obvious that it’s just a social call: “This isn’t work related so I’m going to let you go. In the future don’t call me for non-work matters.”

If she tries to invite him out: “No thanks. I keep my professional and home lives separate.”

When you’re around and she says stuff like ‘OP doesn’t know him like she knows him’ he should shut that down hard: “Well that’s ridiculous. She’s my *wife*. You’re just my coworker.”

As for you:

When people ask you why you don’t like her (in general terms): “We just have different personalities. Not much else to tell.” Don’t contribute to the drama. You’ll only end up looking as bad as she does. 

When people ask you why you don’t like her (if they mention her behavior towards your husband): “Her behavior makes my husband uncomfortable, I wish she’d leave him alone.” Then change the subject. People aren’t stupid, they know how inappropriate she’s being. There’s no need for you to add any more fuel to the rumor mill. 

Should you confront her? No. That’s what she wants. She wants you to come at her and cause a scene. By confronting her you’ll be letting her know that her behavior upsets you and she may even ramp it up. You confronting her will also allow her to play the role of the victim (“Woe is me! OP attacked me when I’ve done nothing wrong! She’s unreasonably jealous of my friendship with her husband!”). 

Don’t sink down to her level- it’s like wresting with a pig. You’ll both get dirty but the pig will enjoy it.

It’s your husband’s coworker and it’s happening at work. Your husband needs to be the one to handle this."
None of this is your fault: you don’t owe him *anything*. Stop talking to this asshole. What he says and thinks isn’t important.
"&gt; I would've appreciated that he tell me this in the beginning instead of lying about his money (his parents aren't actually rich) and this pretty major aspect of his life. I'm not angry at him, but I wonder if this is a red flag?

Nah, that's not a red flag. He's just young, dumb and trying to figure out how to handle money. He probably assumed this was a way of weeding out any gold diggers but his logic doesn't make any sense.

No morals and cruel towards the needy are not qualities you would want in a mate...just saying.

Edit: phone shenanigans"
I don’t think you should talk to them. Your mother/father should. From your OP it sounds like your parents did financially help them out this year as well. They need to concisely tell them that they treat each sibling fairly according to the circumstances and that they did receive financial help. They should also let them know that if they can’t be grateful or welcoming this thanksgiving then they are not invited.
"You sound absolutely lovely and this post makes me sad. My husband and I are both artists and I could never imagine bringing him and his passions down like she did to you. It’s obvious you have talent. What’s also obvious is that she will be a jealous, spiteful partner instead of a supportive one. You can have someone you love AND who supports your dream, and trust me, it is much better than your current arrangement. If she can’t get over this, you need to part ways. Life is too short to bottle up something so beautiful in yourself for someone else’s ego."

If he doesn't get his act together right now, yes, I recommend giving him permanent space, and making space in your life for someone who treats you with respect and love. "
"Wanting to celebrate her birthday by fitting 15 people in one hotel room is extremely bizarre, especially for an introvert.

Where do you think she stands with you? Is there anything special there? Or are you *only* a friend?"

Yes, dump him. Get into therapy. You might even be able to report him for statutory rape depending on the laws in your state around age of consent and how long the statute of limitations is on statutory rape."

Sometimes when you try and help with work, does it feel like you are over-stepping or stepping on toes?

He is abusive, and I know it's hard to believe that because he hasn't done it in years...but alcohol doesn't change someone, it just lowers their inhibitions.

He's simultaneously so particular about his hair that he can't have anyone else cut it, and totally willing to sexually harass his hairdresser. He's hyper sexual, but he's going to pretend that his sexual harassment of this woman was just a joke. I think the only thing you can do is be firm but not engage more than you have to. When he asks you to call his hairdresser, just say ""Bro, we already talked about this. It's not okay to sexually harass people you're paying for a service, and what you said to her wasn't a joke. I'm not calling her. Leave her alone and find a different hairdresser."" "

Or even, her art isn't successful and yours is so she is understandably really sad and hurt about that but deals with it by coming to you and admitting she is sad and strategizes with you about ways to improve her craft or work toward getting more recognition and then the two of you work together to build each other up rather than the route she is taking which is ""Ahh! Burn everything to the ground!"""
Also a great reminder that you should never take kneejerk advice from redditors who don't understand your relationship nuances.

"I've read their a bunch of your replies, and I've got two theories for you (sorry I can't link outside of Reddit so I hope I'm giving enough context).

The first theory is that the girlfriend's family also comes from money, and your in laws are being really superficial about keeping up appearances.

The second theory is that your boyfriend is the black sheep/scapegoat of the family.  This would cause your boyfriend to constantly underplay the actual results of any interaction with his parents (him doing it subconsciously, not maliciously).  It would also cause your ""in laws"" to default to not really liking him, or anyone he's associated with - and by extension, you of course.  The biggest problem with this is that he doesn't know he's actually a scapegoat.  In this case, your boyfriend *wants* to believe his parents love him as much as they love his brother, but in reality it's just not true by way of their actions towards him and the general way they treat his brother better.

The biggest problem *for you*, if theory #2 is accurate, is going to be deciding if you're in it for the emotional long haul with boyfriend.  This is the unfortunate situation I've been in, and ironically married my husband who was also the black sheep of his family (neither of us actually knew at the time).  It's certainly not easy to get through the ""FOG"", where you come out the other side understanding that you're trying to win your parent's love and respect, but whether they'll give it to you or not - you need to realize the relationship is one sided.  If your boyfriend find himself spending more time attempting to keep in touch with his family than they do towards him, like making phone calls or visiting, then he should seriously evaluate whether this is due to favoritism from his parents with a bias towards his brother.  

Just to be clear: I'm not saying they're bad people, or that this is his fault or his brother's fault - it might have just happened organically and none of them noticed.  Or maybe it is malicious and he has shielded himself subconsciously this whole time growing up, ignoring signs like the little jabs here and there about how his brother is ""x but he's only y"".

Unfortunately, the only way you're going to learn whether theory #1/#2 is true, is to confront your boyfriend with this info, and ask him his opinion of which could be more likely.  I'd strongly suggest bracing yourself in case this isn't the first time he's heard it, because he may become irrationally angry and defensive of his parents if theory#2 is true.  My husband actually did this to me one day, which caught both of us offguard because he doesn't really react like that to those situations - and after talking through why he'd gotten so irrationally defensive so quickly, we learned the root of the reason why was because he was already subconsciously thinking the same thing his whole life, and it was upsetting him to have to confront it because I learned this ""secret"" he'd been trying to hide (even though it really wasn't that intentional, just sneaking suspicions and red flags in his head).

Anyway, sorry for rambling, especially if I'm way off base, but I just thought I'd share my two cents based on my experience with similar in law behaviours.  Good luck, and Happy Turkey Day!!"

"I know he’s not making excuses because his mom did invite me to this fundraising gala she was hosting, and then his sister made a big stink about me coming because if I came, their brothers girlfriend wouldn’t be able to come so his mom told him to uninvite me.

She recklessly spends your combined funds on courses she has no intention of trying to pass. 

She plays hooky from those classes she needs to pass to, get this, see her friends.

She works part time while you work double time.

Is she, like, amazing in bed or something? Because I don't see what you're getting out of this relationship, other than someone who doesn't respect either your time or money.

Of course she does not want a 50/50. She might have to actually work, contribute something, be an adult like you have had to be. She's had a free, easy ride, despite you both having mental health issues. Why would she want to give that up? "

One possible explanation I could think of is the house they recently bought. Buying a house is typically the biggest purchase a person makes in their life - maybe he's feeling stressed about it even if rationally there isn't any need to?

"No offence but he seems like a bit of a nob... Like, who does this.. 

I know people propose as a joke but usually, it's something that's laughed about almost immediately, not something that is perceived to be serious for a couple of days. 

On a side note, one year worth of dating a guy is not enough to really decide if you want to marry them, especially if a lot of this has been long distance.

"
"I agree with you: you simply aren't compatible. Relationships shouldn't make you feel bad, they should make you feel good. And when the intimacy stops and resentment seeps in, it's usually game over at that point."
"His goal is to isolate you and make you dependent on him. This usually starts out with friends, then family, then your job until you feel you have no choice but to stay in the relationship. On the bright side, he’s showing his true colours after a few months instead of years. Since he’s showing up despite your wishes and feels like he needs to be with you, you might want to be a bit cautious breaking up with him. Just little things like telling people your plans and spending more time with friends or family."
"This was actually painful to read because you essentially summed up 2017 for me. My relationship of 5 years was over but I kept living in it because I though he would come around “if I just...”

It left me wounded and jaded and devoid of self worth. 

It’s been almost a year since the breakup, and I am relieved to report that happiness still exists out here in the world!! I’ve made new friends, a great career change, and even met someone. I still feel the fallout sometimes when someone is nice to me and I don’t think I deserve it, but therapy through the breakup and after have definitely helped. 

I wish you a peaceful and easy transition out of your marriage, but I hope you’ll go ahead and do what you know needs to be done.  I won’t go into my too long story, but it feels amazing to be surrounded by people who value me. You should be feeling this too."
"I think he wants to break up but is too cowardly to do it, so he's trying to drive OP away. "
"&gt; But it bothers me that he just keeps kissing me even though I barely move and don't reciprocate at all. 

He's 25 he knows you're not reciprocating. He doesn't care. Yes, you have to straight up tell him, but understand that he's probably not going to care then either."
"I understand why you are upset, but this conversation should have happened long before now and you never should have assumed you would be spending Thanksgiving with his family.  Not all families are open to additional guests.  That's a dynamic only he can address.

That said, it is pretty inconsiderate of him to not have even thought to ask you about your plans and perhaps work around it in some way in some sort of compromise.  Frankly, I probably would give that relationships some serious reconsideration.  He sounds kind of like an inconsiderate ass.  

Next time, don't assume and wait until the last minute to have necessary conversations."
"I’m really sorry you’re going through this OP. 

Now to the ugly truth...

He’s had 3 years to tell you and he didn’t. So you have a big blowup and he goes and fucks your friend? What happens when you have another big argument (because you will one day again)? And of all the people in the world he sleeps with your friend. Outside of the cheating of course, a HUGE issue is that he’s had so many opportunities to tell you but he didn’t. It’s one thing to cheat and then confess, but it’s a lot worse to cheat and not be remorseful (at least enough) to come clean. 

I understand that’s it’s easy for us to say to leave and it seems like you want to stay especially since you just had a baby. I would say ask him about why your “friend” emailed him, but given his history he’ll just continue to lie. So now you have to be direct and confront him. If he takes responsibility and doesn’t come up with some bs like “I don’t know why I did it”,”she came on to me” blah blah blah bullshit then demand you all see a therapist immediately and to cut all contact with her. 
If he doesn’t take full responsibility, tries to shift the blame on you for saying hurtful things to him that night, or tries to downplay what happened that night with your friend I say let him go as he is too selfish and cowardly to take responsibility for his actions. Someone who can’t take responsibility for their actions will continue to repeat the same behavior. 

Lastly, after hopefully getting the full truth from your husband tell your friend you know what’s happened between she and your husband then cut all contact with her and remove her from your life. She’ll probably try to apologize but don’t give her the satisfaction of relieving her guilt by giving her a platform to apologize."

"I think you should read Lundy Bancroft ""Why does he do that?"" You can find the pdf online but make sure your boyfriend doesn't find you reading it. Your post reminds me of this extract from the book:
""“YOUR ABUSIVE PARTNER DOESN’T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIS ANGER; HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR ANGER.
One of the basic human rights he takes away from you is the right to be angry with him. No matter how badly he treats you, he believes that your voice shouldn’t rise and your blood shouldn’t boil. The privilege of rage is reserved for him alone. When your anger does jump out of you—as will happen to any abused woman from time to time—he is likely to try to jam it back down your throat as quickly as he can. Then he uses your anger against you to prove what an irrational person you are. Abuse can make you feel straitjacketed. You may develop physical or emotional reactions to swallowing your anger, such as depression, nightmares, emotional numbing, or eating and sleeping problems, which your partner may use as an excuse to belittle you further or make you feel crazy.” 
― Lundy Bancroft, Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"""
"You aren’t wrong. In the slightest. To be completely honest, i think emotional affairs are so much worse than physical. It’s not like he was just complimenting her or buying her lunch... he’s writing poems and talking about cuddling? Nah. 

If you really want to try and make things work I think you should go to couples counseling... but as one of the other commenters said, you don’t have to stay with him because you’ve been together so long. It’s very hard to move past any kind of infidelity... and considering he sees absolutely nothing wrong with what he’s been doing, I’m not sure it’d be worth it for YOU in the long run. 

Take care of yourself. "
Everyone is being so helpful. I guess he opened up about his desires I should open up about my insecurity over my height. 
"&gt;I haven't told my family about this diagnosis because mental health is complicated and I like to pretend that I'm fine.

Yeah, but you're not.  And that's okay.  But in the long run, you're doing yourself a lot more damage than necessary by not treating your condition and allowing your family to become your support system.  

If your brother's social media presence is triggering your PTSD, then unfollow him.  But if he doesn't know that he's affecting you, then he can't do anything to help (even something simple, like restricting his posts on his end so that you can't see them)."
"I think you should politely decline citing the death threat as reason why you're uncomfortable. 

There are some actions so appalling that ""not taking sides"" is taking the side of the perpatrator."
He should be REPORTED to the AUTHORITIES before he can fuck up anymore young girls lives.
"Unless you’re experienced in BDSM, don’t experiment in knifeplay. "
"Yeah seriously. 

OP: “I work at X company”

Bf: “Yeah she’s a software engineer!” 

It’s literally that easy. He is being an ass for caring in the first place though. 

Edit: It makes me wonder if he was just embarrassed that she wasn’t dressed up nice bc he’s shallow about looks. If it was really about the profession, he could have just said something. "
"""They are obviously poor but it is more than that. Roaches everywhere. Food left to spoil. The house smells. Half the floor is torn up. And one of the kids looked like he might have bites of him that indicate bed bugs. Beer bottles just throw out on the porch piled up. Not even poor things, just lazy housekeeping things.""

I think this is just as serious as you think it is. These people need a wake up call. I recommend making an anonymous report to Childline or your local child protective services. They'll assign a caseworker to the family and focus on assisting them. These kids need someone to look out for them and make sure that they're receiving appropriate health-related services and that they have enough appropriate food being provided to them, that alcohol isn't just sort of hanging out within their reach, etc. "
"&gt;&gt;When I told her that I was unable to really control my behavior in that situation she was having none of it, telling me that I should've known what I was getting into.

Hun, this is something you must get ahold of if you're to be a companion to other people. If you know you get overloaded, you must be able to make plans for that *and also* learn how to control your behavior in the moment, or at least communicate with people about your illness. You can't just fall back on ""I can't control this.""

Your gf is right to be pissed at you for leaving her alone, drunk in a club, at 2 am in a bad part of town.

*Screenshots??* He sent his whole family *screenshots*?? What in the name of enmeshment is that? This is not at all normal.
"Dude, he has to compromise somewhere. You have offered plenty of solutions and his only solution is ""my way or the highway."" He doesn't get to fore you to quit your job because he's unwilling to find solutions to his own unhappiness. Also lol at ""single dad"" when he spends a few hours alone with his own child. I'll cut him some slack for being stressed out and depressed, but he doesn't get to take that out on you indefinitely, especially when he's unwilling to consider any solution other than you giving up your career. Is he always this stubborn?

What is his reasoning for not wanting a babysitter? Honestly at this point I'd say couples counseling is in order. He needs to be willing to at least consider other options because you being unhappy is NOT a viable solution for his unhappiness."
"Let's be brutal here... when you decide he's a douchebag in a few months, a year, maybe two and you leave his ass... are you going to want your child to have his meaningless name or your meaningful name? "
"I'm to believe that he wouldn't mind if a dude invited him home to discuss work (whatever he does) and then asks to have sex? That he wouldn't feel uncomfortable?


Come on. For this dude to be so unaware he either has to have zero empathy, somehow missed the entire #me2 movement or just be rapey as fuck. "

"Um, your boyfriend is abusive to you. Flat out. And he’s also probably cheating and definitely having an emotional affair. But honestly that stuff doesn’t matter. Because he is emotionally abusing you."
"My boyfriend hosted a family member before we met that brought bedbugs to his house. He thought they finally managed to get rid of them and then we started dating, and I'd switch back and forth between our houses the whole time. Took us a month to figure out the bedbugs were still there. I was the only one getting bitten, but they didn't look like bedbug bites on me (looked way more like hives or tick bites with the big ring around them. They were huge.) and we couldn't find any signs of them. For some reason I convinced myself it was just some sort of reaction to something in his room, until I woke up with a bedbug on me.

Anyway, the whole point of this is that during that whole month of going back and forth with bags of clothes and everything, I never brought the bedbugs to my house. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's too late."
"aw I'm happy to hear that! You went the best way, being open (with bf) and polite (writing that guy) which was also the most respectful thing to do for your relationship. That's great.

People in this sub are just used to reading terrible things so it makes sense that they would jump to the worst possible scenario as well. They've seen it happen so to say. Either way glad you worked it out"
"Well, now you know you can't trust this ""friend"" with any secret and if you want to cut her out of your life, go ahead.

As for your family, you're gonna have to deal with them eventually. Maybe consider getting a few sessions of therapy to work through this."
"I understand how this situation could make you feel conflicted, but it sounds like John is a great guy who would never disrespect your love for Sam. That’s pretty awesome. "
"The person you're married to is acting like a single person and gets regularly trashed and doesn't come home and you want to know if you're being unreasonable?  

I think you seriously consider whether your husband is actually ready to be a husband.  Personally, if he wants to act single, make him so.  There are really basic relationship things that you should not have to communicate and not getting trashed and staying out all night every night is one of those things.  Your husband doesn't seem to respect you and this is unlikely to get better without making your life miserable and you bitter.

I know you're married and that seems like a huge commitment to walk away from, but the minute you find that there is a huge problem with respect and *your SO is unwilling to even discuss it*, the relationship is over anyway."
"&gt;I honestly prefer our apartment to be completely empty aside from the 3 of us and maybe 1 friend visiting once in a blue moon,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry but have you ever lived with other people? You're basically saying you'd like for 2 people in their 20s to not have anyone over to their house except ""once in a blue moon"". Then get freaked out and nervous when one of them ask if they can have a ~~small~~  party. 

I'm not sure that you are ready to move in with roommates. "
"Yeah exactly! Great phrase to keep in mind in the future, thank you.

Also OP, I can bet that this ""friend"" of hers does not care about her friendship. He's friends with her because he wants to bang her. He clearly does not respect that she's in a relationship. A good, real friend would put their crush feelings aside for their friendship or end the friendship if they can't, when their crush friend gets in a relationship. It's pretty concerning that she won't end this ""friendship"" herself though. What is she getting out of being friends with him? Ask yourself that, and also ask her that. She'll probably defend herself with some shit about how they can ""rely on each other/have an emotional bond/have deep conversations/he makes her laugh"" but really...he's blatantly trying to bang her. She knows it, you know it, he knows it. Anyone with eyes could see it. But it seems like your girlfriend enjoys the attention, OP. Either that or she doesn't think your relationship will last. 

I would be worried if she tried to visit him. He clearly doesn't respect that she's in a relationship, I wonder how much respect he actually has for her. He seems very capable of taking advantage of her."
"&gt;He's been told by someone else that my picture lowers his value as a man. 

This comment would make me rethink the relationship completely.  It's incredibly sexist and really shitty."
"&gt; basically told me a few days ago that either I stop writing screenplays or she leaves. I don't want to lose either.

She's laid it out for you, it's writing or her.  

A true life partner would have no issue with your hobby or your success.    

If you pick her it won't end with you picking her, anytime you aren't bright eyed, and bushy tailed she'll say it's because she made you give up writing.  If you are as attentive as she'd like she'll blame it on you quitting writing.  This will be a never ending game of her being unhappy and you jumping through hoops to make her happy, but she'll never be happy.    

She made it clear you either choose her or you choose writing.  I think you have a 3rd option, you decide to get rid of her.  She's not supportive, she's not being honest, and she's giving you ultimatums.  When you end things tell her that you aren't choosing writing, you are choosing to not keep her.  "

"Sorry, I'm not understanding how you are getting updates on how the brother's girlfriend is being included and you are not?  Could you parse that out for us?  Is your BF telling you about upcoming family events and saying-- what exactly?  Are you asking him about her?  Is he volunteering that she'll be there?
If you are getting this info from your BF, what emotions is he displaying when relaying the information to you?  Is he like ""I'm TOTALLY pissed that Jane came to the picnic and they said there wasn't room for you again.""  or is it more like ""yeah, the picnic was AWESOME. I so wished you had been there. Oh, Jane? yeah, she was there.""

"He's a toxic mutant, sorry."
"When I told my dad I was leaving my husband he told me, “I know you made mistakes, but he’s a real dummie for how he’s always treated you.” It was such a relief to know I wasn’t a failure to everyone because we were divorcing only 3 years after the wedding. "
"Yep. I am always the first one to defend women having male friends, but this smells fishy. He’s contacting her daily and making innuendo and she’s not putting a stop to it. Not on. "
I came to the comment section just to say this.  It seems more like the boyfriend's the problem
"And yet the night was ruined for him because he didn't get to feel like a big man. This guy is going to need a GF who constantly pads his ego and OP, you don't sound like that kind of girl. He could have made the best of it and used the money he saved on dinner to get you another gift. "
"Leave him. Of course he's being nice, he knows if he isn't it's all over. Things are probably easier for you as well because you know they're temporary.

Leave, and tell yourself (but not him) if he handles it reasonably, without getting abusive, then you can consider working on things. But he won't. He'll lose his shit."
"&gt;Remember, for him it happened 14 years ago but for you it just happened.

Most important piece of all this. You have 18 years of marriage together. 14 years ago he made a mistake. He has had 14 years to deal with that. You have had 2 days. Talk to him.

 Perhaps have a neutral party present to assist. Perhaps a therapist or a friend that can play that part. Just someone to talk everyone down if emotions get to high.

You need to talk to him though. It will only eat you up inside otherwise."
"It sounds like she is jealous of your success if her attitude changed once you got attention for it. You were succeeding at a creative craft quickly or faster than she has pursuing her own craft as a career. She was either in denial or ashamed of those feelings and just let the resentment build till she burst.

You can’t avoid the elephant in the room anymore. Ask her to set side a time to talk, describe how her behavior has made you feel and ask her to be honey with you about how she has been feeling. Even if this talk goes well you should try counseling. For her to have a public outburst and let her resentment build to the level that she is consistently passive aggressive towards your success there are some deep issues there."
"Crazy mom's. Been there. 
When I was 17 my mom kicked me out without shoes on because I was planning to get married as soon as I turned 18 and she wanted me to stay with her so she could use me to pay the bills while she partied 3 nights a week and cashed unemployment checks. I had to call the sheriff to get my work clothes and school clothes because my mom wouldn't take me back.

My only advice. Do what is best for you. Don't let your mom get in the way or hold you back. 
You want to go to CC and save money, do it. "
"Well, first of all, that's neither old nor middle English, nor is it Shakespearean English--it's kind of a weird Renfest thing.

Maybe ask if he's trying to hint that he wants to get into Renfest performance or something. ;)

Actually, what I'd do is say ""I know you think this is cute or romantic, and I appreciate how cute and romantic you are! But this weird speech pattern stuff doesn't seem cute or romantic to me, just kinda cringey. I like it best when you're *genuinely* cute and romantic, not when you put on weird speech patterns."""
"You need to get into therapy. If it is affecting you this much to this day, this is the first step that you really should take. You can't make your brother give up his hobby and you both can't be on eggshells around each other. I'm sorry that you were in an accident, but people can't stop their lives because of something that happened to them. For social media I suggest you just hide some of your brothers posts so you don't have to see them as much. "
I think this is the best approach. I don’t want to make it into something it isn’t but I feel she should know.
"&gt;my sense of humour tends to be sarcastic and dry.

In other words, ""I am abrasive and unintentionally rude.""

&gt;I always got on much better with older people (even as like a 10 year old) who could get my jokes and understood me much better.

In other words, ""I think I'm smarter than the people around me.""

&gt;I have worked very hard my whole life to dumb myself down and to try and conform to what people expected/wanted from me.

Straight out of r/iamverysmart. Dude, stop it. I'm sure you're intelligent but come on. Nobody likes a Lisa Simpson.

&gt;I went to therapy and spent a lot of time trying to rethink things and part of that has been to try and be myself, be nice and pleasant to people and whilst it’s been a hard road, I thought things were good and I was doing well.

Good, and I'm sure you're improving, but it seems you're not all the way there.

It's not just about changing what you *do,* it's about changing how you see yourself and others. You see yourself as the smartest person in the room, and it shows. "
"\&gt;   I swear i cant stop checking her out. 

Yes, you actually can.  You're an adult and should have self control.  It's actually GREAT that you are still so very attracted to her, the issue is just your choice to not control it better so that she doesn't feel uncomfortable.  Why don't you sit her down, tell her how you feel, and ask her how she feels about it, jokes about old creepy guys aside.  Ask her which specific looks or actions upset her or make her feel uncomfortable...and then stop doing them.  You can, you've just been choosing not to.  IT may be hard to stop but it's not impossible, so do it."
I'd leave. Maybe he's stressed but he should never treat you like that even when he's stressed. When you return I'd have a serious sit down about your relationship because it seems like he dgaf anymore. If he doesn't care anymore leave for good. You deserve better anyways. 
That's a great idea and something I am going to work on.
"Hi me from the past! 

I'm so sorry you have this relationship with your mum. I have a similar with mine too. It sucks to have to have a barrier up when she's around - we still enjoy each other's company these days but our topics are pretty much confined to clothes, weather and baking. 

My dad was alot like yours. The only difference is that since he and my mum are ten years apart, he can't beat the shit out of her like he used to because of how old he's gotten. I remember vividly my dad just kicking the shit out of her when she was pregnant once. Her arms started protectively around her stomach but eventually, ended up wrapped around her face. And really that's the story of my mum. 

The hardest thing I had to face in therapy wasn't that I had one abusive parent - that was obvious. It's that I had two. She used to tell my secrets too. I used to try and defend her and get beat up too. I have to live with the guilt and horror that, as a child, I couldn't save her. Which is guilt I really shouldn't have at all. I also spent a good chunk of time hating my mum. 

My mum also once said I was 'destroying the family' when I tried to move out after my dad gave me another black eye. This is code for 'you're making my life harder'. You can't judge her too harshly though - she was a victim too. Shes in survival mode - like you. But that doesn't mean you can't take care of yourself. 

So here's what you do: cultivate a friendly relationship with her. You don't have to tell her your secrets if you have enough other things to chat about. (Caveat: this is if you still want to have a relationship with her). What are her interests? Does she have friends (if your dad wasn't anything like mine, she doesn't). This isn't because you have to shoulder the emotional labour of making her feel better - this is a kindness to YOURSELF so you don't have to deal with her negative emotions. The hatred and anger will eat you up and make it harder to heal. You have to be the grown up, because she certainly won't be. I know that seems like it isn't fair, and that she deserves your anger (she does) but I bet you somehow feel angrier at your mum then you are at your dad. And that's because in some ways you may be emulating your dad's behaviour (not cos youre evil, but because Monkey See, Monkey Do). Don't be that man. Don't be your mum. Be someone better. 

Keep going to therapy. Find a way to move out and surround yourself with family - REAL family, not the garbage dumpster fire your dad and, to a lesser extent, your mum made. That's not a family. 

I really began to heal once I was out of that toxic environment. I personally also finally found peace when I finally found a partner who could help me create the home life I always wished I had (one of my worst fears was ending up in a marriage like my mum's). You don't have to find a partner, but try and create the safe space you were denied growing up. 

Feel free to drop me a message anytime you want. I'm happy to chat. I've been there and it sucks. But it gets better. There is no real justice in the great scheme of things. Whatever words you want to fall out of your mum's mouth in penance will never happen. Your dad will never suddenly no longer be an asshole. It's up to you to help along the positive changes that will lead you to better waters. "
"Don't beat him up too badly. He's likely had a lot of times where girls didn't like him for *him*, but because of his media presence and fame. Understand that he didn't lie to you because the truth was bad, he lied to you in order to keep your opinion of him untainted by the idea of money. It was no way a slight at you! 

It sounds like he really likes and adores you and I'd continue on like nothing had happened. So you got a YouTube famous boyfriend. Who cares? You wouldn't care if he was a doctor would you?

I'd also not worry about being the hate ""YouTube girlfriend"" or anything. That definitely is getting ahead of yourself and I doubt he'd rope you into that without you wanting to. Plus not all girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands and wives of YouTubers are hated. The YouTube and twitch stars I watch have SOs who are as much loved as they are."

"I actually think its a really good sign that she just came out and told you she had a crush. Regardless of how the crush developed, bringing it out into the open in your relationship seems to help make it fade away quickly."
"&gt; I confronted her about it the next day, and she said nothing physical ever happened, and that she was having a hard time getting in the mood for me, so she was sexting him to feel better about herself.

&gt; She said she would drive to the hotels and imagine us running away from our busy lives for a night and banging it out, and then go stay with her coworkers.

You do realize that's all grade-A, top level, 100% pure bullshit right? Like it's actually insulting that she said that to you. "
"Yeah consider if you had someone making unwanted advances at you and touched you all the time and ran their fingers through your hair. Would you not immediately ask them to please STOP touching you? I know I would. I would ask your husband to promptly set up that boundary, shut it down with consistency if she doesn't respect it, and then have a serious conversation with him about why YOU had to ask him to establish that boundary. That's not OK."
"When you say you have to dumb yourself down, it implies that you think you are smarter or superior to most people.  That attitude tends to come across whether you realize it or not.  Combined with the sarcasm and aloofness, it doesn't paint a good picture.  At a bare minimum, you should start reading some self help books on social interaction.  I've heard good things about *Emotional Intelligence.*  Ideally, you should look into therapy or coaching.

"Additionally, he's categorically wrong about the hiking thing. You NEVER leave the slowest hiker to their own devices. 

The only time I'd consider that acceptable is if the slowest hiker is one of the most experienced and/or it's a easy walking path. Or, when kids are in the mix: Dad leads. Kids with all of their energy tend to keep up. Mom dawdles behind (but that's okay because she's the adult in this situation)."

The strangulation is a HUGE danger sign, OP.

Consider contacting a domestic violence service or women's shelter; in the US we've got The Hotline or Love Is Respect; if you need suggestions for other areas I'd suggest Googling resources (remember to clear your history!) and/or posting here as there are commenters from all over. These services will have dealt with these sorts of situations before and will have advice and resources for you.

"He definitely should’ve given you a heads up rather than having you go in blind like that. My parents are racist too, my mom told me when I was like 13 that if I ever ‘brought home a black boyfriend your father’d have a damn heart attack.’ So naturally we don’t have the closest relationship.

I’ve never dated anyone, but if I ever did date a black person, or really any person of color, I’d never just bring them home without warning them. I’d let them know, and then give them the choice of not meeting them at all as I don’t even care for my parents meeting the people I care about. 

If I were in your shoes, him not telling me AND not defending me at all would’ve been the end of our relationship. Have you talked to him about it? Let him know what he did was wrong and why you’re upset? "

"I would say that there's a bigger issue than your personal concerns here. A phobic driver is an unsafe driver both to himself and his passenger and to other drivers. Driving requires a huge amount of skill and, though everyone thinks they are good at it, many people are not. I'm not sure that it's in anybody's interest to force this man onto the road. (Edit: It's different from other phobias like snakes or spiders - you can't get someone else killed because of those fears.)

I think that the way you attach  manliness and being taken care of to this one skill is something you may want to work on about yourself. How would you feel if your  husband attached your femininity to some stereotypical female skill which you were uncomfortable doing?

The only legit thing would be if your husband expected you to drive him to places you wouldn't otherwise be going together and if he was placing an unfair burden on you, but you've said he's okay with footing the bill for public transport and this is about your culture/upbringing vs. his culture/upbringing. If you knew this is how he felt when you married him, you consented to this situation at that time. If you didn't know, then there is a bigger conversation to be had now about a misunderstanding about how your lives were going to unfold."

You've essentially told her it's ok, and you have to tell her ""Sorry, but after further thought Im not comfortable with this arrangement."" Don't stick around if she insists on it. Doesn't mean there's anything wrong with her either, it just means that you two aren't ultimately compatible."

It's really sad when a friendship ends, but from everything you've written, Andy and Joe don't sound deserving of your BF's friendship. This was probably inevitable. And if what Tom says is true, and they're talking shit behind his back? He doesn't need friends like that.

What her ""friend"" did is extremely disrespectful of your relationship. Making friends is one thing, but this guy doesn't seem like a friend. It seems like he is a Nice Guy waiting and hoping that he will get a shot eventually.

Don't be shocked if he starts bad mouthing you and asking your GF for personal info about your relationship to use against you.

I don't think it's unfair to say that contact should be cut with ""friends"" who hit on her (or you). Honestly, she should have cut him off the moment he asked that question."
“Methinks he doth protest too much”
"also fwiw, calling and making appointment for a spouse isn't always a red flag. my husband has severe anxiety and it's nbd for me to do stuff like that that stresses him the hell out. But we have give and take unlike the OP lol."

"That’s a really great way to express it, thank you so much."
"&gt;""if it's time for her to be pregnant then it's time.""
&gt;

DO NOT HAVE SEX WITH THIS GIRL UNTIL YOU FIND OUT IF SHE IS ON BIRTH CONTROL OR NOT!!!! Why would you have unprotected sex with her even once with these suspicions???!! Plan B is NOT birth control.

&gt;I also believe that accusing her of stopping birth control on purpose will be a relationship ending event
&gt;

If she did in fact stop her birth control without discussing it with you, it absolutely should be a relationship ending event. Having a child should be a 2 person initiative, with both parties aware. I do not see how you could (or would want to) look past this."
"Well, to be a bit callous, tough shit. He doesn't have to agree with their names, they are their names. There is no magic right way to name a cat.

"I'm a math professor. A few thoughts.

What happened during the office hours -- this aggressive, confrontational way of teaching -- works well for some students. But a good professor will develop sensitivity to individual learning styles. He should have done better here.

What happened after the office hours -- that strikes me as really unacceptable. Even if you *\*had\** lost your temper, which you clearly did not, your professor is obliged to be polite to you. 

In my opinion you did nothing wrong. That said, if you decide to make amends, you might do something along the following lines. First, try to figure out the technical point he was making. Then, you could write something like ""I apologize for leaving your office abruptly the other day. Anyway, I think I've figured out X, could I please come by your office at \[time\] to discuss and see if I've got it right?"" And then, if you do show up, don't bring up the incident again -- just talk about the technical matter until the discussion reaches a satisfactory conclusion, and then thank him and leave.

Finally, universities are full of people who are there to help you, both from an interpersonal and a technical standpoint. Any faculty members you have a good rapport with in the same department; the office of the Dean of Students; the ""Student Success Center"" if something like that exists on your campus; the counseling center. I don't think you should try to get your professor in trouble, but you ought to be able to find a sympathetic ear.

Good luck!"
"I realize the situation is touchy because they’re his roommates and he probably doesn’t want to rock the boat anymore, but he needs to be able to stand up for you in these kinds of situations if you’re both in it for the long haul. 

The ticket situation is an example - he needs to be able to say to his roommate that stealing your parking pass was unacceptable behavior. Why does your bf have to pay the ticket?!? The other guy should. Your bf has to be able to say to them - they don’t have to like you, but you’re a part of his life now, so they need to treat you civilly.

If their lifestyle (drugs, parting, etc.) is really so different from what your bf wants, I think they’re eventually destined to become ex-friends anyway, so maybe it’s not much lost.  "
Everyone here is making so much since (sense?). He was probably afraid. He's just usually so confident and well spoken the abruptness caught me off guard.
"You’re right, draw the line clearly and if she crosses it then you need to make a decision about the kind of person you are. It’s not okay what she’s doing "
"That is... really sad. I'm not going to comment on how horrible it is that this man refuses to do something that would make his disabled wife smile, because I think you already know how depressing that is.

Instead, I'd recommend trying an app like TaskRabbit to see if there is someone who could help you for a fee. Maybe you could also contact a local church or community group for assistance?"
I strongly advise a public place for the break up. He seems the type to lose his shit pretty quickly and being in public will hopefully slow the escalation and keep you safe. Also have a friend waiting for you somewhere near by. 
"Yeah so all this 

&gt;&gt;The three of us barely know each other, and haven't even moved in, so to introduce the idea of having 10-15 people who are complete strangers to R2 and me show up and be in our apartment for someone else's birthday (that's not even yours) makes me uncomfortable. 

Is unnecessary and where it gets attack-y. She knows all of these things already. "
"Is this behavior in the realm of usual for her? Does she often (or even semi-regularly) set up expectations that you can't meet or don't even know about? If so, that's a big red flag. If not, assume that there's something different going on now that's got her on edge. Ask her what she was afraid of and why she was especially afraid that night. "
"&gt; I think this might have been there in the shadows the whole time.

I think so, too. I can't imagine he suddenly went from being cool with what you do, to essentially saying that your parents were freeloaders who should've pulled out.

Honestly... what he said was *so* unbelievably disgusting. If you can look past it and forgive him then you're a better person than me, but I wouldn't be able to stand being in the same room as him, let alone consider him a boyfriend after this."
Contact the authorities immediately.  Your mother has abandoned her minor child and needs to be held accountable  She has made her disabled child homeless and is willfully refusing to act as her parent.  Call social services and get some help.
"If he won’t spend time with his best friend without “the wives” then that is a Dave problem, not a you problem.  Make it a thing where you have a new hobby or more work or something, and you can really only commit to one couples date a month. The other weekends the guys can hang out one on one or the two of them can hang out with her, but you have already established how much time you have available.  

And don’t let your husband guilt you about this either.  If his friendship is so fragile that it won’t work without the wives, that’s something he’s gotta work out with Dave, not your responsibility to suck it up and play buffer.  "
"If this is typical, then I think your issue is bigger than falling asleep and not waiting. Frankly I’m exhausted just reading this interaction, what a child. Do you have any other examples? Because this behaviour is clearly not a one time thing, are you prepared to deal with it? Have you tried bringing it up, how does she react? That will tell you everything you need to know."
What? Women are people? Who knew?!
"Yeah, and to be blunt, if you don’t - he will. 

He’s showing all the pre break up telltale signs, so either you do it or wait until he does. Sucks, but I’ve been there, this is all very familiar. "
"Instead of feeling embarrassed, feel empowered that you want to deal with a shitty situation head-on instead of running from it. Not being loved the way you should by someone isn't a reflection on you, it's a reflection on them. And it's OK to decide you're done with it and move on. A lot of people do it, and they end their marriages and are better for it."

"A 20 year old began dating a 15 year old? Am I reading that right?

Also ""He earns 6 times my salay. We split all the costs (flat, food, going out, trips etc) 50:50 and I think it is fair."" If you think this is fair, then you dont think well."
"When I read your title, I immediately thought he was guilty. However, something about your story has me believing he is telling the truth."
"&gt;I'm to believe that he wouldn't mind if a dude invited him home to discuss work (whatever he does) and then asks to have sex? 

You have to up the stakes there. If he's like 180lbs, you have to have it be like a 280lb power lifter that does jiu jitsu on the side and could easily overpower him.

That's why I hate it when guys are like ""oh, I'd love it if a woman were that aggressive with me!"" Like. fuck, buddy, of course you would. Because you know that you could overpower her at any point if you wanted to.  Of course there are times that women abuse men, but day-to-day, the dynamics are just different."
Yeah im thinking ops bf is just saying they said no etc
"&gt;Henry said that he thinks I'm throwing my money away and that we could be $5,000 richer this year if I hadn't thrown it at my latest cause. 

OP, you're donating your own money, right? He is not richer or poorer for it. He is not entitled to your money any more than the charities you donate to are. And to be honest I think he deserves it rather less. 

What he essentially also said was that your parents would have done better to not have had you in the first place. I don't know how easy it would be to recover from that. "
"On one hand, this kind of reminds me of when my ex told me I should lose weight, but then would get annoyed and offended when I didn't want to join him in eating junk food and eating out all the time. 

On the other, when I did start getting healthy (after losing 200lbs of crappy boyfriend), I definitely went through a phase where I felt like I couldn't hang out with any of my friends or do anything fun because it would derail my fitness goals.

Don't get me wrong-- your boyfriend needs to find a balance, it's not great to be so focused on body goals that it takes over the rest of your life (unless it's for a specific event, then it might be temporarily unavoidable). But at the same time, you definitely need to be supportive and appreciate the fact that he's doing this for you.

Some ideas for things to do that aren't restaurants/drinking:

- cook dinner together. Healthy/bulking food doesn't HAVE to just be endless bland chicken and rice! Find some recipes he can bulk out with extra fat and protein. 

- have friends over, rather than going out

- go out, but don't drink. If the only way to have fun going out is through drinking, that's not great... 

- find other types of nightlife (if it's a big city, I'm certain there are things like concerts, gallery openings, open mics, etc you could check out)

-gym date!

"You need to regain control over your own finances. At the very least, it’s not smart to not know what’s going on because if he suddenly becomes incapable, you need to be aware of what’s happening. And at worst, he could be mismanaging your finances and hiding bad things. Get in there and familiarize yourself with what’s going on with your money and work on setting a budget. As for your parents? This is your money and your decision, not his. You may need some marriage counselling. "
"Okay.  

There seems to be 2 things at play:

You’re picking up on her ownership of the cat, and you want to make sure you get ahead of this so she understands that when you leave, you’ll take the cat; that you’re the actual owner. 

You also say you want there to be 1 thing you don’t share. 

Well, an animal that’s social and wanders freely around the home like a cat will be shared. That’s how it is. 

What you can do is save all texts showing the cat is yours and make sure the vet info etc is all in your name. Make it clear your roommate doesn’t need to buy things for the cat. If she’s over feeding the cat stop free-feeding (you can leave water out but leave food out for only a limited mealtime). You have a cat and you have a roommate. You’ll only be able to not share if the cat is locked in your room.

I’d send a text. “I don’t want to come across as combative with the cat. Sometimes I worry you forget she’s my cat meaning if I ever leave, she would come with me. I just want to make sure we are on the same page with that.” This way you have her reply and you save it so if she ever thinks she can lay claim to the cat, nope. 

But the feeding thing is easily remedied and while she may force-cuddle the cat it doesn’t sound like mistreatment."
"That was rape. Your husband raped you.

You were absolutely incapable of providing consent. Your husband knew that, and decided to take advantage of your incapacitation.

He isn’t someone you can trust - instead of taking care of you and making sure you got to bed safe, he hurt you.

Whatever else you decide to do, this is not a person you should spend one more minute alone with, ever."
“This relationship isn’t working for me so I’m ending it”. 
"&gt; she’s known him for long enough to get how he speaks sometimes and to understand not to take him seriously. 

I honestly hate this mentality that so, so many men have. They think they can be assholes as long as they're consistent enough about it that they can laugh it off, and expect others to laugh it off as well, with a shrug of the shoulders and a ""well that's just how he is!!"" 

Nah. There's no excuse. I'd want nothing to do with this guy either."
My son is 22 and would never think to ask me if it was ok to bring a girlfriend to an event. He would tell me she is coming. Especially something like a family wedding or holiday celebration. I’m sorry but if your boyfriend is 23 and not bringing you around his parents that is on him. After 3 years you should be part of the family. No way would I be ok with my son being in a relationship with someone and me only meeting her one time. I can’t even imagine this happening
"1. Dump the guy.
2. Give baby your name.

"I know you want to confront Lisa in such a way that forces her to admit that she's been smoking weed, but there's no need.

Take Lisa aside when you two are alone and say, ""I know you've been smoking weed and lying about it."" When she begins to object, let her do so. Respond, ""I am not *asking* you whether it's true. I know it's true. And you know it's true. I just wanted you to know how deeply hurt I am. Less about the drug use and more about how you could lie so confidently to me and then let me apologize when you knew you were in the wrong."" She might continue to lie at this point. Maybe she'll be silent. Who knows. End with, ""You've shaken my trust in you. When you're ready to admit you've lied and talk about it, I'm all ears. I want to trust you because I love you, but you're making it difficult. The lie is bigger than the misdeed you concealed. That's all I have to say right now.""

Let her think about it. Hopefully she'll do the right thing and get where you're coming from.  If not, you know that you're with someone who lies to get out of 'trouble,' which is really quite scary. It's a good to confront this behavior in your partner and communicate that it's trust-ruining. A lot of people who reflexively lie in awkward or difficult situations don't think about it too much when they're doing it. They just feel panicked and don't want you to not like them. So, it's not necessarily malicious - it's immature and selfish. And for the person who's being lied to, it's so destructive to trust and stability in a relationship. For a relationship to survive, your partner needs to be willing to give you bad news and you need to be willing to hear it."
"Yea that's weird in that it's so completely unnecesary.


Even people who are more comfortably nude don't just strip and pose in front of other people. Also it's suspicious that it happened right as the other people were away. 



I'm from a culture that doesn't have as strict a nudity code too. But still undressing is somehow seen as more sexual than simply being nude. Her walking to like the toilet/kitchen nude from her room? That I can get, that's cultural, I would do the same.


Undressing in front of someone with noone else present? That's weird. "
LOL. Life coaches are a joke. No qualifications needed.
"You need to talk to your parents. It's not your job to protect an addict. Unfortunately addiction is an ugly disease and it can make a person exploit and undermine every single relationship they have. You shouldn't have your education, your job and your life derailed because of it. You reacted correctly by telling someone, now you need to work with your parents to figure out how to deal with this before your sister escalates because she thinks you're an easy mark.

Until your sister hits rock bottom and decides on her own to change, she's going to keep trying to steal from all of you."
"&gt;""Just because your family was poor and took every handout you could doesn't mean we should encourage other people to do it. It's not our problem if some kid doesn't have a pair of winter boots. Maybe their parents should have pulled out.""

This doesn't sound, to me,  like a response that would come from someone who just wants to spend more quality time with his girlfriend. He insulted her family by suggesting that they were freeloaders, and expressed pretty clear disdain for poor folks who accept help from others. It sounds like he's made it pretty clear that his problem is that he doesn't think poor people DESERVE this sort of help, because they brought their problems on themselves (which is an easy way to see the world when you've never struggled with financial insecurity in your life).  


If this started as something else, like him wanting them to have more closely matched priorities for how they spend their time and money, it seems like he has revealed some pretty important worldview issues along the way. He sees charity as wasteful and enabling, and he doesn't seem to have much empathy for those who have had fewer privileges and opportunities in life than himself. Given how important charity seems to be to OP, this seems like a really serious point of incompatibility.   


If I were her, I think this would be the end point for me. I can't imagine sharing a bed at night with someone who is comfortable insulting my family and then saying that poor kids who can't afford boots are ""not their problem"" because maybe their parents ""should have pulled out."" Like, he's not WRONG (in that no--they're not OP's ""problem""), he's just an asshole. "
"According to your girlfriends definition, you're low class.

According to your girlfriends definition, she's high class.

She does not believe a person should marry out of their class.

Put your girlfriends assorted beliefs together, and she doesn't believe you should be together and that she's too good for you. Even worse than just believing that in secret, which would be terrible enough, she tells you! Often enough for you to describe it as a habit!

These statements are your girlfriend regularly telling you that she's too good for you."
"They are crossing your boundaries for sure, but not your boyfriends since he hasn't drawn boundaries with them.  He seems happy with the relationship and nothing will change unless he changes it.  They won't know they have overstepped unless he tells them they have and puts consequences in place.  You need to have a serious discussion about this with him and find out if he has the spine necessary to put boundaries in place that will make you comfortable.  Don't move in with him if he can't or won't do that.

When I was newly married I was checking in with my gym front desk. As I was walking away one of the two guys said to me, ""He thinks you're really pretty."" I walked away without saying anything, stopped, put my hand in the air with the ring and said in a panicked tone, ""HI SORRY I'M MARRIED."" Then walked away.

God it took me forever to leave the locker room."
"I cant see how this relationship is going to work if you have a hight libido and hes a minute man who doesn't care about satisfying you. Its more than him having a low libido because plenty of people who have sex infrequently can still have amazing sex.

I've broken up relationships with people I've got on with really well because we weren't compatible in bed and I dont regret it. When you find a partner who matches your tastes in and out of the bedroom it will be worth the wait.

Oh and there's nothing wrong with you and Im sad you feel ashamed over this."
"&gt;Is this worth ending the relationship over?

Well this combined with the fact that he's already cheated I would say is definitely relationship ending. "
"Hi there, mixed martial arts coach here who also holds seminars teaching self defense to women and survivors of abuse.

Your mentality is exactly where it needs to be. You aren't looking for a fight, you aren't assuming you can beat down anyone who fucks with you (because trust me, taking classes doesn't make you invincible) but you have no illusions about the fact you'd need to fight with everything you have to protect yourself, as you should. You have every right to defend your body, and the fact you can discuss it and feel empowered doing so is a good thing.

He may have a hard time empathizing because he hasn't been in that situation, but that's a him problem. Ask him what he'd sooner have you do if you were being assaulted and your safety was at risk. There is a massive difference between fighting to defend yourself vs looking for a reason to hurt someone, and absolutely no one of sound mind can fault you for the former. If it comes down to a worst case scenario in the moment, you do what you have to do, your boyfriend has the privilege of not having to worry as much about this as you do."
"100% justified. Not only did you leave her alone, she was probably panicking when you suddenly disappeared, until however long it took for you to go back.

Sorry, having a disorder doesn't absolve you of responsibility. YOU need to think about what to do next time. No, you don't need to crawl under a rock. What you need to do is be conscious of how you're feeling. If you feel like leaving, you need to say to your friends, ""sorry, I need to go home"".

I feel for you, and also have ADHD, but this is on you. "
Your gf is being unreasonable here and her expectations come off insane tbh. She's a 28 year old adult and she should be acting like one. 
"If you've expressed that his comments make you uncomfortable and he still continues to make them, he's being malicious. I would break up with him."
"3/4 times a month is so little, especially if he's a minute man. And no you're not weird for wanting lots of sex. I'm the same with my partner (2 and a bit years together) and when he says no I respect it and he respects my right to do the job myself. Your boyfriends low libido is no right for him to call you a sex addict, nor is your want for sex more than 3 or four times a month. I'd probably lose my mind if I was called a sex addict in this context. Tell him he hurt you. Try talk it out of you're up for it"

"He is clearly having success with what he sees as a hobby that she is full time dedicated too.  So he can work a 9-5, support them, and still be more successful with the art side project.  It sounds like his success is making her feel very small.  The art side was the one thing she had to cling on to and he is doing it better.  Now I feel her reaction isn't warranted at all.  Being a couple is about building up the other.  Even if they are a brighter star.  "
"Omg! I had the same failure feelings and guilt. After I FINALLY left people came out of the woodwork telling me they knew he was an ass and were so glad I was happy. Them telling me how they could SEE my happiness really impacted me.

This is definitely really fast paced.

You could also do romantic fitness things together like hiking. My husband isn’t a body builder but he does eat a lot and hit the gym.

No, he's being a jerk. He's the one using race as a conversation-stopper, as a way to avoid doing the work he needs to do in this relationship. He's saying he doesn't have to make the effort to be better because of his race."

"If you want to end the friendship, just stop contacting her. If you've only texted three times in seven weeks, it won't be that dramatic. ""Calling her out"" isn't taking the high ground so don't do that, and if anyone asks what happened, just say ""we drifted apart"" or something that doesn't allocate blame."
"Yeah I agree. OP Your mom is racist. As a black woman I wouldn’t choose to be around this type of negativity especially during thanksgiving. You should probably explain that your mother’s problem with her involves the color of her skin and then let her decide if she wants to go. 

It would be very awkward and damaging if she finds out from passive aggressive comments during dinner.  As for your mom being okay by the time your ready to propose to your gf, it’s already been a year and a half, you might want to be more realistic with your expectations. "
"You said it yourself in your own post: ""Dad, I am not ready to have this woman in my life because I am still grieving for mom."" That's a perfectly understandable nice and concise way of putting it.  You can elaborate on it but asking your dad to respect your grief is nothing to be worried about."
That’s a nice update. Good for you two
"&gt; How would you feel if your husband attached your femininity to some stereotypical female skill which you were uncomfortable doing?

I keep imagining how I would feel if a partner told me that it wasn’t OK for me to pay a house cleaner, because cleaning the house is what makes me womanly... that conversation would not go well."
"I am of the school of thought that if they aren't asking questions about it, or if it's not giving them nightmares, it's probably fine. It's unlikely they really get what's being sung to them - to them it's just a nice moment with their father. And maybe when they are grown-ups they'll look back and think 'how hilarious is it that dad sang us metal songs as lullabies?'.

Tell him that if they start asking questions or expressing fear/concern about the lyrics that he should stop."
"I think he is lying. He could have easily offered the information about your coding job when introducing you. He could have just said: ""Hey, I didn't know you were dressed for visiting the plant floor today, that's unusual"" when you came in.

I suspect the real problem is not in anything that you neglected to do (which he could have rectified easily). I think the real problem is that you did something that he *didn't* want you to do. And what that is, he won't say because it would make him petty and jealous to admit it. Either he doesn't like that the coworkers liked you so much (more than him?), or he didn't like that you looked more masculine/tough than him."
"It’s sounds like you are overworked, overstimulated, and overwhelmed. If you can afford it please hire a mommy’s helper or a nanny in your days off. That should give you atleast one day for yourself every week where you just decompress from 9-5 with no one in the house. Seriously even if this will stretch your budget I think it’s very important that you do that rather than have an eventual breakdown."
"&gt;I think it's fair

If you are dead broke at the end of every month, unable to save anything, and your boyfriend is not your arrangement is not fair. 

Clearly, you are living above your means and since apparently your boyfriend either expects you to magically be able to pay for stuff you can't afford, ask your parents to pay for it, or is willing to ""loan"" you the money and you pay it back (again apparently magically, since you dead broke at the end of the month).

It's time to have a realistic and serious discussion about your finances with him. Either you guys need to start splitting costs equivalent to your actual incomes, he needs to be willing to pay for the extra crap he wants to do for the both of you (not loan you the money and magically expect you to pay it back), you need to live on a budget that works for your income so that you can actually start saving too, or you need to consider not living with this guy. "

Tell him to go pound sand.  He lost the right to care about  who you're sleeping with the second he broke up with you.
"And then purposefully hid said fact from him. OP, ask him how much he values his relationship, and if this young girl who probably isn't ready to be a step mom, is worth jeopardizing it because she seems fun and new and exciting. "
"Dude your text was super passive aggressive and petty and if I were your roommates, I’d be really put off by how judgemental and unreasonable you’re acting. Also, her request wasn’t unordinary. "
"\&gt; the last time someone did she sued them- costing them two years and 20k

Doesn't sound right. You can't sue someone for ""not talking to you"" last time I checked. Most likely she'll find some random dirt or bullshit. Go through your head and think about that. Also, it can't be too old. 10 years old evidence probably won't do shit in court for petty things...unless it is SERIOUS legal offense. 

I'm not a lawyer but personally you have nothing to worry about.

Move on and enjoy life. "
"&gt;just caving and telling him that he's right seems like a stupid idea too...

Definitely do not do this.

When he's sober, ask him what the hell he's talking about. He's claiming to know this thing, he should be able to explain what he's basing it on. At the very least, he should be able to tell you when, where, and with whom you supposedly had this date.

It's possible he'll give details, you'll realize what he's talking about, you'll explain why it wasn't what he thinks, he'll apologize, and you'll move past it.

It's possible he'll admit he was being weird and insecure because he was drunk, got paranoid about something minor, he'll apologize, and you'll move past it.

If he refuses to get specific in his accusations, or if he makes a specific accusation which you deny and he doesn't believe you, or if you demonstrate that whatever he's accusing you of was impossible and he doesn't accept that... at that point I don't think there's any moving past it; dump his ass. You don't want to end up in a relationship where the other party is doing you the ""favour"" of forgiving you for something you never did."
"""Doesn't take anything I say during fights seriously."" For me, red flag. I can understand if you tend to pop off with things that you don't actually mean during fights. Otherwise, your concerns should be taken seriously, fight or not.

It definitely sounds like a lot of miscommunication. Be clear that you want more sex (not just during fights). Be up front about how it's making you feel. You can either clear this up with good communication, or you can stay pissed, live in those past feelings, and make this relationship even worse."
"Yeah I’m a D&amp;D playing lady and I desperately want OP’s crush to find a new gaming group, OP sounds sweet, but oh good Lord the toxicity of young nerds lusting after THE FEEEEEMAAAALE. Honestly I’d never advise a nerdy woman to join a D&amp;D group without at least one other woman unless she was already friends with all the guys."
"He sounds kinda shallow? Like, he could've interjected and said something about coding if he really wanted to but didn't. Either way, this shouldn't even be a problem. Why is this a problem? Why is he so worried about what they think? Does your job really mean more than you and your character, which they got to see over the get together?"
"Talk to your wife about it and maybe encourage her to get grief counseling about your daughter's life if you guys haven't already. Maybe consider getting everyone into grief counseling honestly, including yourself. "
I always make it a point to not say bad thing about girls I'm dating because I dont ever ever want them feeling unwelcomed in my family. So fucking cringy. I would drop any relationship if I ever saw or heard them talli ng bad about me to family. Talking honestly about issues in the relationship is different.

"Where I'm from life coaches are not accredited. Which is why I don't tend to think hiring a life coach is a great idea. With an accredited therapist this would be HIGHLY unethical, and they would be in such trouble for being friends with a client, and dating a clients husband.  Such sketchy behaviour."
"He says it’s just a friendship now. Don’t make me laugh. Of course it’s “just a friendship”. She dumped him. The second she changes her mind it sure won’t be “just a friendship” anymore. It sounds like that’s already happened, anyway, and they’re back together again with all the handmade gifts and love poems and talks of cuddling. "
"Man you’re overthinking. People showed up, had fun, and celebrated what is basically an arbitrary thing in your life, just because they like you.

"I would go no contact with him, block his number and move on. His actions are very manipulative and he is not going change if he knows you'll cave to him. "
"&gt;I now see her as someone to worry about and someone that might have bad understanding of boundaries and what's appropriate.

You're way overreacting. She asked, but she was perfectly respectful when you said you weren't OK with it. It's also not ""inappropriate"" to have a party. "
"&gt; I think they don't make sense. She trusts her PT in every other instance and follows all of her directions, but when her PT says, ""you can pick up a kid"" she's suddenly dead wrong. 

Im sorry but I think you are the one who doesn't make sense. Heres my point of view:  


 

* She's almost sure she can't get pregnant because she would have to go off too many of the medications that help her manage her injury. (We always knew this was a possibility and discussed adoption in the past)  
Means: Honey if I quit all the medicine to bring forth a baby my body and mind will break. I'm in so much pain and I dont know how to face this amount of pain for 9 months fully. It scares me.    

* However, she no longer wants to adopt, either. She now thinks that she's ""too anxious and self centered"" (her words) to be a mom, particularly because her injury management takes a lot of time on any given day.  
And:
* She is concerned that her injury makes her too weak to actually pick up or hold a small child.  
Means: Honey I dont just need the strength to pick up / hold the baby once; its a hundred pickups a day, its hours holding the baby. I might be able to do it a little but not for 10 full years until the kid doesn't need it anymore. Do you really believe raising a child means to only pick this baby up once, or even just once a day? Kids need attention and love and I am not physically able to give a child this. (The whole global warming car thing is just her trying to explain a feeling of powerlessness really so dont focus too much on it. Just rather ask her physical therapist if your wife really is well enough to run around watching a toddler..)

&amp;#x200B;

* Most recently she also brought up some concerns about the marriage itself, specifically that we fight when we get stressed. She is concerned that means we cannot handle having a child because there will be too much stress for us to handle  
Meaning: She is noticing how you keep explaining away and minimizing her health issues (like thinking picking up a baby once/ barely being able to pick up the child is sufficient strength to raise said child, or how you expect her to quit pain medicine and thus live with pain for 9 months) and stuff like this. She wonders if you don't care about how she feels / her healing. 

All in all I dont think you are fully grasping the problem (her physical issues) and you keep trying to negotiate her illness and pain with her, and that impossible for her to deal with. She's got an injury and she can't negotiate that just take her time to heal and you're pushing her to not heal but rather brak her body a bit more. So these arguments you have are crazy;  she is just trying to explain that shes too sick to have a pregnancy or run around after toddelr and kids while you're at work, while you keep asking her to be able to do it anyways. And this has gone so far now that you act like you know that she is physically ready for a kid by having arguments with her ""logic"" when she says she cant do something physical, and you're using her doctors against her. Just let it go, or accept that shes too sick for now. You're just disrespecting her injury by telling her she's well enough for kids now when she says she isnt. Look at all the things she has given up on, its not easy for her too and you're rubbing salt in her wound by not understanding this and treating her fear of pain as mere unwillingness. (to her it seems like you WANT her in pain if you keep pushing like this and she will resent you in the end).

"Honestly, I'm a family person. But if my brother or ex did that to me, they were literally dead in my eyes. You have no obligation to ever meet either of them again. Explain to your parents that it won't happen, even though they love your brother, if they know how you feel about it, they should respect your decision."
staying together for the kids rarely works out well for anyone (including kids)
"Cool, but at some point he should be declining if you’re not invited. That’s just rude after 3 years. "
"My ex was the expert in the insult/compliment.  I married him, and it got worse, not better.  

You only have 6ish months invested with this guy.  My advice is to dump him and then block him.  He will circle back and be all the things you would ever want from a SO, but I guarantee the insult/compliments will come back.  He is training you to feel inferior to him.  He is training you to think you are lucky to have him and never leave him no matter what shit he pulls on you.
"
"\&gt;  Being divorced, i value my family's opinion as they all knew my ex was crap and saw it failing before it even started. I told them if they ever feel that way again, to tell me.  

They told you. Why are you complaining that they're doing exactly what you asked them to do?"

"Unfortunately I've kind of lost faith in school administration, sports regulatory associations, and police, to handle sexual assault claims appropriately.

I still think it's worth reporting stuff if only to create a paper trail that may help another victim along the line... But every serious thing I've seen brought to the authorities has been really horribly handled.

So I guess I feel like I ought to do what I can to protect people in my life, because who else will... :( "
"Your boyfriend is taking this way too seriously, and it’s not your responsibility to fix it. It’s actually a funny story. And no matter who owns it the restaurant is still great, right? So the night was still special. Tell him there’s nothing to even be upset about. "
"This is a pretty serious piece of information to leave out of your post. If she's struggling with a bipolar diagnosis then her behavior makes a bit more sense. It's not justified, at all, but it makes more sense. Is she actively working with doctors/therapists on a treatment regimen? Or is she trying to manage it herself on her own?  


EDIT: I just went through your post history and it seems like this has been going on for a bit. If things have been bad for a while and you can't handle it anymore you don't need strangers to give you the okay to break up. If you're unhappy and if you don't think you can handle a BPD partner that's completely fine and valid, but unfortunately this is how bipolar tends to go from what I've read. Good luck and I hope you two can find happiness, whether it's together or not."
"&gt; She began breaking down begging me not to contact him. 

Because she lied to you and him contacting you would expose not only the cheating, but also the lies.

"You have named them; Mister Boy, Runts and Nips and then you have a series of nicknames for them. I'd say that is pretty typical for most pet owners. "
"&gt;  I've actually had to edit out names and pronouns from my scripts before showing her because she would get insanely angry when I created female main characters or female love interests of a male main character, and it would derail her completely from giving me actual criticism/opinions to hounding me on why I was fantasizing about women who weren't her. We actually had a pretty big blowout once when earlier on I sent her a script with a male and female main character, and asked her if I should make them love interests. Apparently because the male character shared a minor characteristic with me (favorite food), I was obviously inserting myself into his character and fantasizing about getting with the female main character.

This is... really unhealthy. Like your girlfriend actually sounds mentally unstable."
"I wouldnt be very trusting that he only ""fell on(in) her"" then ""slept"" on the couch.  Sorry, but that sounds like bullshit.  It could be legit too, but with her withholding all the info until her friend said it is not a good sign.

"You were not wrong to decline their invitation.

Where you are wrong is in continuing to be in a relationship with someone who talks negatively about you behind your back.  He has created a hostile environment among them for you.

"Fuck that guy. You deserve WAYYYY better. Sooner or later he’ll try crawling back to you because he knows you’ll always be there.  What I think you should do is ghost him.

"Is your brother disabled enough that he needs round the clock care? If so, your mom needs to look into getting some sort of regular nurse

"A) 11pm is late, that's not a bad wrap-up time. 1-2am is the sort of unwinding night where you don't mind losing track of time, which, while fun, simply doesn't always work with schedules/energy levels and isn't necessarily better than a fun evening following by reasonable sleep.

B) Usually people either do an indoor thing or go out, doing both in one evening can be draining if not pre-planned, esp if it's already getting late.

C) Couples usually arrive and leave together, so if one person is tired or wants to go home, then unfortunately you lose the pair.

D) It's sometimes easier to propose ""X and I were discussing getting a drink in town, if anyone's keen to join"" rather than ""would everyone be into going to the bar after this"". People suck at committing to or making group decisions."
"Honestly I would say that you may change a lot as a person between now and 2020 so it's best to keep it at a level you feel comfortable with. 

The friend thing to me suggests that she wants the ""status"" of being engaged (effectively showing off to her friends, that they are taking part in it mean they have the same maturity level) and the ""fun"" of wedding planning more so than a refection of her deep an abiding love of you. I think she needs to grow up a bit and so do you before any engagement or wedding happens. 

I would let her know that this pressure is unfair and it's making it difficult to remember the reasons you were together in the first place and overshadowing the meaning of a wedding/ marriage. If you guys are going to be together forever it won't hurt to wait till you graduate and live together for a bit before proposing. "
"&gt; She wants to book a hotel in the city and fit all 15 of us into one room. The problem is nobody is going to try and take the time off to go.

"If OP has ever said, ""I'm not a pessimist, I'm a realist"", he's an asshole.


I think a lot of people like him don't realize, you don't determine whether you're an asshole, other people do."
this is not him finally admitting to anything. this is definitely not the whole story.
"To be clear, him being on the phone constantly when he’s at home with anyone is not ok. 

He’s not actually spending time with you or your kids, and you’ve just had his child a month ago. 

This isn’t even about him having an emotional affair (though it sounds like a red flag for one), it’s about him dedicating so much of his time that is meant to be spent with you and the kids to someone else. It’s not right on you, or your children. He spends most of his day at work, he shouldn’t be spending the time he’s at home at work too. 

Start with that, and see if he cuts down on texting her at home. If he doesn’t, he may be emotionally attached to her, and that’s a whole new kettle of fish.

"He's rationalizing what he did, except it's fucking not ok. But he thinks it is. 

*And now it's a joke to him.*"
"I think I like this idea the best. I think if I explain to Alan he wouldn’t mind spending an hour or two alone, and I have some movie gift cards I could give him.

I just want to make everyone happy, but not at my expense necessarily. It’s been a while since I got to be happy about something."
"You're the one comment that's bringing it all together. I don't disagree with your plan, but the GF has already been confronted with ""the evidence"", and still doesn't seem to care.

/u/thechromechild, let me give you a personal story. I was once your girlfriend in this story, when I had been dating for a few months with my now wife. Similarly to you, she had tolerated it at first on account of the ex being ""my friend"". But one particular vacation, we got over a huge argument over it, and she laid down the law. She forced me to choose, and in doing so, made me realise that even though I had no cheating intentions, I was enjoying the attention. It also made me realise how little I cared for dishonest ""friendships"", and much I had been hurting her by failing to take her into consideration in all this.

I cut all contact and haven't looked back. Unsurprisingly, unlike when I lose a real friend, my life wasn't diminished in any way at all.

But it did take my partner being willing to say ""look, I don't think you're going to cheat, but this friendship is clearly not merely a friendship, so stop shielding yourself behind the friendship flag. You're free to continue having this friend, but if you do, know that I won't be here anymore""; in order for me to see things clearly."
"How much porn is he watching?

You need to tell him how devastating his comments are.  You may need to use the analogy of expressing dissatisfaction with his penis size to get through to him."
"I think you would have had much better luck if you came at this from a stance of ""I need"" or ""I want"" rather than ""my co-workers think.""

It sounds like your boyfriend needs to get his depression treated, but it also sounds like you need to decide what you want and need and communicate that directly. You don't need to bring your work situation into this at all."
"Get your ass to a lawyer ASAP!!!

Because this actually isn't your decision.  He as the father has the option of visitation and could even ask for 50/50 custody.  You need to find out what your areas regulations are.

And...your son is hurting.  It may not seem like it on a day to day basis but having your parent reject you completely is damaging.  Having a father come in and out is damaging as well.  Either way, it is time to start getting your son some help to figure out what he wants and how to handle his reality.  Ignoring it won't work."
"Yo she doesn’t need to be told it’s out of the ordinary. That doesn’t resolve anything whatsoever.  She either knows that already, or she’s unaware but it’s already been done. 

You don’t need to inform people that their actions are weird. That’s not your job "
"You talk about how great your gf is but it's pretty clear she isn't great. If you want to date her, that's fine, but call a spade a spade. She's thoughtless and places her ego over the feelings of others, she doesn't care how she makes others feel. She isn't a nice person to others. If you can't admit that, no answers here are going to help.

If you can admit that, good, fine, you are dating a jerk. Lots of people do it. But you have to accept that it is the place you chose to be. Then weigh your options. 


She lacks self awareness. At this age, if she doesn't have it, or care to, as she clearly only cares about her own feelings, that's what you got. Thems the breaks. 

Now how to navigate it? I'd suggest having your own friends. Couples don't have to socialize solely together. ""Babe I'm going out with Steve after work. I'll be home at 8."" In this case either socialize on your own, or accept you probably won't ever have friends. She's like social kryptonite. People at this age are way less tolerant of people like her.  

You could push the issue with her, but she sounds super unreceptive. And she sounds like she would just find a way to make you and everyone else the jerk. If she asks you why, be honest though. ""Last time you saw Steve he felt you were really aggressive about ____. That's all I know. You did come across quite intense. Maybe ask him?""

""If everyone you meet is an asshole, you’re the problem.""

You got yourself an asshole girlfriend. You aren't the first, and you won't be the last. Accepting it is the first step to figuring out how to work around it.

My friends dating assholes just socialize separately or they break up.

"That's all well and good but you don't need to expose yourself to dangerous psychos because you understand her damage. Stay away from her and him and definitely don't attend the wedding.

You're not doing her any favors by sugar coating the fact that it is super fucked up of her to even consider asking you to be a bridesmaid in the wedding of someone who threatened to kill you. If her normal meter is really as screwed up as you say you should really tell her outright that she's not acting right so she knows it's not  normal and you won't accept this kind of treatment."

&gt;Our circumstances had changed since he originally applied. 

He should ask the new company for a relocation package that will cover what you have put in the house.  Other than that, what has changed?

You will never be ready to move.  There will always be yet more reasons to stay where you are ...you got a promotion, you want your kids to grow up with grandkids, etc.   You will never, ever be ready.  He is.

&gt;I haven’t mentioned anything to my parents yet, but I know they’re going to think it’s an irresponsible decision.

It's not their life and the fact that you would think it should be a factor in *his* decision is concerning.  Everything in your post screams that you want him to be happy with *your* life and already resent that he isn't.  Good Luck with that."
"I mean, he proposed to distract you from a discussion about his having potentially cheated. It's not surprising that it doesn't feel right with you and it's probably one of the most unromantic proposals.

Yes, extremely.

No, he wants to hurt you and cause you pain when he's angry. No one should ever be with someone who does that, ever. He knows what he's doing. You cannot trust him, he has and will continue to hurt you. Do not be with someone who you cannot trust to not physically lash out at you. Please listen to your father.

Yes, extremely. He doesn't sound emotionally stable and he has already suffocated you. This will escalate. You need to get out now."

"People have covered the jealousy part quite well. This comment makes me think that her insecurities have even deeper roots. And she isn't dealing with this the right way. Insecurities-&gt;fear, anxiety-&gt;outburst. She might not even be aware and actually perceives you as malicious.

If I were in your position, I'd think really hard if walking on eggshells, hiding a big part of me from my partner is really something good for the both of us. You aren't going to get your happy relationship back just by hiding your hobby. Soon her insecurities will show themselves in something else and make you hide even more. That isn't healthy.

You don't have to give up immediately. But you must talk about her insecurities with her, ideally with some help of a couple counselor. You have to approach the subject calmly but firmly. Explain to her that you won't be forced to hide such big parts of you from your partner. Tell her that you noticed her insecurities and in order to stay, need her to work through them. And that you'd be very happy to be there for her during that time and find a counselor. I promise you, she will get angry, defensive, might even attack you verbally again. Stay firm and calm, don't take it personally. It's just a knee-jerk reaction.

If she refuses to do anything about this, let her go. Don't stay for the memories you have with her. She is showing another part of her, don't ignore it."
"&gt;So a couple months back this new girl started at his work and he she lives in the neighborhood so my boyfriend offered to give her rides to work. So they spend every day together in the car and honestly, I feel like she gets to spend more time with him than I do.

Your boyfriend has allowed himself to slip into an inappropriately close relationship with his co-worker.  Commuting everyday resulted in lowering boundaries and gradually crossing over to over sharing and an emotional attachment.  This is exactly how over half of all affairs begin -- with co-workers who ignore boundaries.

&gt;Have I overreacted by banning him inviting her over when i'm not there?

No.  In fact, you under-reacted.  He has been in denial about where his actions have led and it's time for him to own it.   He's trying to have two girlfriends.  It's time for him to shut this down:  she's going to have to find another way to get to work and he has to limit his interaction with her to essential work related communication only.

*Not Just Friends* by Shirley Glass -- read it this week and sit down for a real talk with your boyfriend this weekend."
"Agreed. My best friends husband had an affair with a coworker. It did not end until there was physical separation between them. Even then, they have tried reaching out to each other. My friend should have left after the first, second or heck even third lie. 🤷🏻‍♀️ But same excuses, holidays, etc. "
"\&gt;   I'd feel uncomfortable with so many strangers in our new place that we aren't even in yet. She is cool with it. I'm now terrified that she is going to be trouble to live with.

You are moving IN with strangers.  I really don't understand your severe over-reaction here.  She asked politely, offered you an out if you were uncomfortable, you took the out, she respected it.  There is NO REASON for you to now consider her ""trouble"" or to be ""terrified"".  10-15 people is not a raging house party.   You are jumping to some pretty crazy conclusions that I don't think are warranted.

\&gt;   I honestly prefer our apartment to be completely empty aside from the 3 of us and maybe 1 friend visiting once in a blue moon, but I know living with roommates doesn't work that way. As for myself, I'd never, ever do anything like that, and at most I'd have 1 person over in my room, hanging out quietly.

I really just don't think you are cut out to live with roommates, especially strangers.  ""Completely empty"" is simply NOT going to happen when 3 different people with 3 different social circles live together.

Have you ever lived with people before?  If you are this averse to strangers, why are you moving in with strangers?  I can almost guarantee you that your new roommates are now worried about living with you because you've overreacted so badly and have a strange idea that your house will be entirely empty of guests for the most part.  That's not realistic at all."
"I’ve been in a terribly abusive relationship. 


First, until you know otherwise you should assume your sister was not given a choice about the vacation away. In all likelihood he decided for her and going against him was not safe. 


You should also know that it takes an abused partner something like 9 tries on average before leaving sticks. Leaving is the most dangerous time for an abused partner. Even when the abuse isn’t physical, while leaving the possibility of *dying* is very real. And in these situations the abuser often doesn’t just kill the partner, but the kids and/or family trying to help. Your sister needs to go to a domestic violence shelter where they will hide her and help her in all the ways your family is trying to help too. They will help with resume, child/spousal support, going to court, therapy for her and her kids, getting her own place or relocating her if that’s necessary, etc. 


When she leaves she puts your parents in danger by staying with them. She doesn’t mean to, and it’s entirely understandable why she would want to go to them but she really needs to go to a dv shelter for all their safety. 


When I was leaving an ex-boyfriend who was a federal law enforcement officer, shelters across the country helped me relocate to a safe state one by one until I was about 3,000 miles away. Me and each shelter worked together to find the next shelter until I got far enough away. It was terrifying knowing that he had the reach to find me nearly anywhere. But it was also empowering to get away and start a life without him. It’s been like 10 years now and I’m in a much better place but not without repeating my mistakes until I figured myself out. 


"
"You are certainly being fair. He has a history of making false allegations against people, and the best way you can protect yourself from that is to not be in his presence, so he can't later claim you did something to him. That, plus the very real risk of being literally caught in the crossfire of their violent marriage. You're not just shunning him to ""punish"" him or because you don't like him - you're not willing to subject yourself to his presence because he's not a safe person to be around. Pretending otherwise is just enabling your sister to stay with her abuser."
"There you go. 

You didn't make the ""right"" impression but instead of using his words like an adult and saying ""Oh shit, I forgot you were on the floor today, I feel like I kinda put you on the spot here, I'm sorry"" he made it out to be your fault for not knowing what he wanted you to do and say and be. Although I think you made a good impression which matters way more than you know."
[deleted]
"I don’t know that you need to be “happy” that he was honest with you. Maybe that’s where you’re struggling, because you’re forcing yourself to feel happy about something that is pretty gutting to hear even when true.

You need to work through your feelings and probably talk some more. He’s allowed to be unattracted by weight gain but you also have the right to be concerned if 35 lbs is enough for him to react quite so negatively.

Split the weight gain/loss from the relationship discussion. Lose weight for you or you’ll forever be worrying about every little gain or loss. And talk to him, sometimes people say this stuff because it’s easy to blame weight instead of some other underlying thing like he’s stressed at work or whatever. But even if he meant what he said, talking about how it made you feel should give you some kind of reassurance that he loves you and just wants you to be your best you, or whatever he’s thinking "
"&gt;  Should I have just kept my mouth shut?

Of course not - talking to him about the problems was the fairest and most respectful course you could take, as you were giving him a chance to shore up the relationship. It's not your fault that he failed to recognize the opportunity you were offering.

You have a boyfriend who neglects you and freezes you out. I realize he has issues and I can sympathize, but it's up to him to own them and work on them. As far as your happiness is concerned these are neither here nor there.

At this point, it sounds like you seriously need to consider whether you can ever be happy with this guy."
"The fact that he talked mad shit on her and her parents, like- dude put that out there to see if he could get away with it. "
"Agree with all of this. OP, check out r/raisedbynarcissists if you're looking for some more support."
"I would strongly recommend you see a therapist about this.

Was this an abrupt change? I don't want to be alarmist, but I would also get a brain scan to make sure that nothing is off."
"This is a really mature approach and thank you for suggesting it.

OP if you like him/care about him and want the relationship to continue: explain to him how he messed up, how it made you feel, and what you expect of him in the future. "
"&gt; When I say the words ""you don't give me any presents, and that makes me sad"" I feel like so immature and shallow.

But it's not immature or shallow.

Yes, your decision to want to skip the holidays was probably made emotionally - but for good reason. We're not machines. We're allowed to be emotional. Besides, skipping a single holiday season isn't the end of the world.

I think it's time to start being a little selfish. To figure out what you want from your partner and to ask for it. He's a partner. You two are a team. This should mean you two strive for equity as much as possible. But, you need to do your part to make sure he understands what would make things better. "
"&gt; You don't have to do giant group things every fucking time. She might be more willing to do things if it was 1-3 people at a shot. Maybe invite a very small group over for dinner every other week.

This is a great suggestion. I completely shut down and withdraw in groups larger than 8-10, but I’m super sociable in small group situations.

Small group dinners/hangouts could help the GF develop those stronger friendship bonds she seems to want, in a more comfortable environment.

Her birthday plan definitely sounds untenable though, she needs a reality check there."
"He is.

There is no hope unless he stops.

No flesh and blood human can compete with porn/fantasy and win.  You are not a permanently 18 year old shape shifter with no purpose other than to be visually appealing to him.  Porn is.

Ask him to go 60 days with no porn.  Expect refusal and a tantrum.  Then demand counselling and treatment for addiction, because that’s clearly the root of the problem.  If he refuses that, consult with a divorce lawyer."
"Is there something that's changed for him in the past little bit that might be driving this?

Also, it's your time and money, you get to be the boss of those things."
"Dealing with chronic pain while raising a kid is no joke. My friend has a similar ""invisible"" disability with chronic pain, and is also a mother. She was unable to pick up her child at all once he was out of the baby stage, and had to learn how to change diapers with one hand. It's a real challenge. Children don't understand disability or chronic pain, they test limits and are exhausting even for the healthiest of people. Once they can walk and they know you can't pick them up or do much to stop them, they're off!

Is there no way you could become the main caregiver? If she is successful at her job, and has good employers who understand her predicament, maybe this would be something worth considering? Being the main caregiver is a rough job at the best of times, let alone when you're already disadvantaged by pain and mobility issues. Maybe you electing to take on the lions share of childrearing responsibilities might put her at ease a bit. 

That doesn't solve the potential nightmare of pregnancy obviously, but maybe if you were to commit to taking on the main bulk of parenting she might be more amenable to re-examining adoption options. "
"Thing is, your mom picked her side long ago, and she’s not going to waver from that. Your dad is toxic, but your mom is an enabler and expects everyone else to suffer because it makes life easier for her.

Also, as a younger sibling, it would have meant the world to me if my older sister had a quick, private chat of ""Hey, I've noticed Mom and Dad have been a little hard on you lately, and A and I get a lot of their attention for our own situations. Just wanted you to know that I've noticed that, and if you ever want to talk or want my help with anything, I'm here and on your side."""

"So I have a 6 month old and thought I would chip in...sometimes the only time I get to myself all day is a shower. If your wife is overwhelmed and needs a break, sending the toddler in to shower with mommy is not really helpful.

ETA: OP gets to go to work and be an adult with clean clothes and a change in the same old. She has to be at home with a little buns latched to her body and 100% dependent on her 24/7 PLUS a naughty toddler. I think OP needs to provide more support and understanding. And perhaps pay for a nanny or maid to help."
She's being very protective of her backup plan. Doesn't sound like this relationship means as much to her as it does to you. What you do with this info moving forward is entirely up to you. 
This is also a respect thing. If he can't respect her decision to donate her money than this relationship won't last very long.
"You deserve so much better. I know leaving someone you love isn't easy but it sounds like you're a sweet gal who is doing everything to try and make it work, and he's not reciprocating. I've been there. It didn't end well. Sending lots of love.

EDIT: particularly, ""yeah i'm a selfish asshole I've been telling you that"" stands out to me. i had an ex say similar things. this guy is literally admitting he's being a shitty boyfriend and not caring about you, and he just expects you to accept it and be okay with it, despite him having no intention to change his behavior. That's when you know it's time to go. i'm sorry."
"I would stay home today and process as you said. Let her go to the Thanksgiving festivities alone and she can explain why you're not there.

Good luck "
"Thank you for saying this, it jumped out at me too.  The smartest people I work with are also the nicest and most well liked people.  OP is just being rude, in another comment he said that he used to just walk out of the room when other people came in and refused to talk to anyone at all.  It’s not high school and you don’t have to be BFF with everyone but this isn’t even bare minimum. "
"&gt; She always means well and never intends to be hurtful.

Look, OP, you can't say something like ""you guys don't know what you're talking about"" and not have at least some understanding that you are making hurtful statements. 

It's pretty clear that she wants to be right more than she wants to be happy. As long as she continues to make that choice, this will continue. The ball is in her court, and all you can do is make her aware of that. The rest is up to her."
I think it's time to quit the relationship without notice.

"What has he actually done to try and recover his libido? Has he been to the doctor? Tried any sort of treatment?

Instead of asking how YOU can build your trust in him, I would ask what HE is doing to regain your trust. Screenshotting nudes of an ex is gross behavior that is disrespectful to both you and her - he should have deleted them when they broke up. Has he deleted them now? Has he offered to be open with his passwords?

He needs to be moving hell and highwater here to figure this shit out if you are even going to consider staying."
"Sounds like he was accustomed to you begging him to take you back, so when you finally stood up for yourself, he upped his jerk game to try to make you jealous. Try to look at it from this perspective: he is inconsiderate, he is taking advantage of you not being able to kick him out, &amp; he’s being rude on purpose to try to hurt you further... how lucky are you that you aren’t going to spend your life with someone like that? I know it’ll take time to work through the emotions of the breakup, but you should keep reminding yourself that you’re so much better off not settling for someone like this."
"I'm really sorry about the loss of your mother.  I can't even imagine how tough holidays can be shortly after, whether or not you were close. 

As much as he wants to blame it on different values, he doesn't give a shit about whether you feel special or loved.  It's not vain or shallow to not be okay with his regifting and thoughtlessness.  It's not unreasonable to expect some kind of gesture for your birthday and holidays.  He doesn't seem to value your happiness.  If he doesn't do anything for you for Christmas, what's there to even cancel?  All of the effort that you put in while he sits on his ass?  If you give him a gift every year, he's just upset that you won't be getting him a gift.  You wouldn't be getting a gift anyways.

It may have been 13 years ago, but it was still a 25 year old man going after a 17 year old kid, so you may get some less-than-pleasant responses due to that.  "
"I think this is really a great way to go about it because it also helps to show that her reaction was reasonable. It's possible that she might be feeling conflicted about ""abandoning"" (for lack of a better word) a client and running out in tears. 

Also, if she has any sort of online booking service or something, leaving a positive review could be helpful, or perhaps monitoring every now and then to make sure that your roommate doesn't leave a negative one."

"Hey there! I'm so sorry this is happening, it sounds like hell. From a purely financial perspective, please PLEASE talk to a divorce attorney immediately. Seriously, my friend, right. Now. Google several in your area, make appointments with at least two. They almost always do a free consultation. My concern for you is that, if you get divorced, you may be completely liable for any debt she incurred while in the marriage. I hear that you think your finances are separate, but the courts may not see it this way.
You don't have to live in this house with this person. IT IS NOT BETTER FOR YOUR DAUGHTER IF YOU STAY! You've become so used to a terrible, unhealthy situation that you're trying to dodge making the hard call. 
Please imagine yourself waking up in a clean, quiet home. Groceries you bought, plan for the week that includes time with friends, hobbies, and time with your daughter. You can have all of these things. It's going to suck for a minute, that's ok. Call that attorney. I honestly think that divorce will be good for your wife too!"
"She's going to be hurt. That's something you have to accept. I'm sorry your friend put you in this position. I would encourage him to break up with her ASAP, the longer this goes on the more pain it's going to cause her. This will hurt her. Of course it will. He needs to break up with her for her sake. So she can find a partner that is attracted to her. Staying together at this point is being very mean to her. He needs to stand up and get it over with. "
"Yeah, honestly if I was in OPs situation I would refuse to go to that house even if soley based on the bed bug issue, regardless of how pissed off they got. No way I'd ever want to get stuck with bed bugs. "
"1) You don't know that he hasn't done this with someone else.

2) He's still socializing with her and lying to you about socializing with her

3) Running off after a fight and banging a friend is such a childish thing to do especially after something that really wasn't that bad. It was a tantrum because he couldn't do something that he just wanted to do regardless of the consequences.

What exactly has your husband done to make himself a safer and better partner to you? Because if you stay married other things will happen...people get sick...parents need help or die. Bad things are going to happen. And what has he done to make sure he is going to handle it like a grownup. 


 Yes, talk to a lawyer but also keep in mind that he needs to do lots and lots internal work that you can't do for him. "
"You should not give him a second chance because a second chance could end with you in the hospital (or worse).  Frankly, this kind of thing should be reported to the police because it is incredibly likely this guy will do it again."
"OP, this is very true. The one time I've had to take Plan B my mood was all over the place for the next few days.. I would never take one that my partner had picked up ""just because""."
"I have HSV, My husband, who I have been with for a decade, does not.

&amp;#x200B;

Herpes is not a death sentence, and I understand dating with it must be hard. But there is no reason for you to be stuck only dating other people with it. Don't stay with this guy just because you feel trapped. It's not worth it. Eventually you will meet a great guy that wont cheat on you, and wont care about your diagnosis.

I know that sounds campy and cliche, but its the truth. "
"This isn’t a traditional open relationship, they are usually based on communication and trust and it is mutually beneficial for both spouses. Not to mention it should make your sex life more interesting, not non-existent. This is an arrangement called “wife sleeps with multiple men”."
No. This isn’t the 1950’s and there is no shame on you working or him actually being a dad to this child. The intense adherence to gender roles at your expense is a red flag. 
Right? I wish I could get people to leave at 11:15
Yeah. I thought the OP was going to tell us about how she shares needles with strangers and has unprotected group sex with randoms. I have been on this sub too long. 
"&gt;  I love going to brewery’s or a sports bar for a drink 

You need to find other places to socialize if you want to meet non-drinkers.  

I trained in Boston for awhile and met plenty of non-drinkers or light drinkers in your age range.  But people like that don't hang out in those places or want to go on dates there.  They do outdoors activities, music, art, etc.  Find non-drinking activities and you'll find people you are more compatible with.

&amp;#x200B;"
"This. And it's been effective to the point that OP is blaming herself and looking for ways she can fix it.

OP... think carefully of what you would think if you had a friend/sister/whatever in a similar situation, and what you would tell them to do. Now say that to yourself."
"Your boyfriend is nearly 10 years older than you and terrified people -- especially his family -- may visibly recognize that age difference.

That is your red flag.

You can make your own choices, including the choice to wait due to his opinion.

However, the real issue here is you're dating a man who flipping out that it's your hair that is going to draw attention to the actual, real age difference that does exist between you and him... Could this be gateway controlling behaviour? Yes, it could. But even if it's not, it's a kind of insecurity from him that is a bit concerning. If was he dating a woman who was taller than him, we'd tell him to suck it up: She's tall. He needs to suck this up: You're younger than he is. Obsessing over your haircut is not a healthy way to address his insecurity about that reality."
Ammonia goes a looooong way to clean walls. My parents are smokers too and I use it dilutes with hot water to take the tar off their walls. And it’s cheap!
"He should t ask you to live above your means. If the income disparity has that much of a difference then you two need to pay in proportion of your income OR he needs to live by what you can afford. If he cannot understand that then this isn’t the dude for you. 

Furthermore, you really should prioritize your savings right now. You never know what can happen and you should have money set aside. Please please don’t continue to spend and have nothing set aside. If that means you move out into a smaller space that you can actually afford then so be it but don’t put your financial future at risk for this dude."
You should have told your gf before you made all the family plans and included your sister. It at least would have given her a chance to voice her opinion and decide not to go or accept it.
I thought I read the relationship length wrong because I just could not fathom it. I'm 21 and dating a 16 years old seems gross to me; they're just kids. No wonder there's a massive power imbalance in their dynamic
"Thank you, honestly. That will be my plan. I'm also close with mall security so I'll let them know, too, and I'll probably have them walk me to my car for the next couple of days just in case. "

"I feel sorry for your niece. I, too, grew up in a household with abusive parents. Make no mistake here: your brother is abusive. Maybe not “physically abusive” but the fact that his first reaction was to scream at her in that manner is *terrifying*. That constant yelling and physical intimidation is going to do a lot of damage to her emotions even if she doesn’t realize now or seems strong. 

Slamming his hands down? Breaking her make up? Screaming at her instead of explaining “I think men are going to sexualize these videos, stop doing them”? It’s absolutely not okay. And you, OP, are being naive if you think this is the first time this has happened. His daughter is 15 and might seem like a grown up but is still figuring out the world. Shame on him for using physical dominance and verbal intimidation instead of logic, compassion, and patience. 

Personally I’m glad she has that video. She needs to back it up to a cloud-based drive. The threat of her posting that online for all his friends and family to see might just get him to stop treating his teenage daughter in this disgusting manner. It clearly already has since he suddenly now wants to apologize so badly. "
"Oh my God worried doesn't even begin to be strong enough though, right?

He held you down and covered your mouth during sex and then hit you and called you names??

OP. Please listen. Your BF is not someone you are safe with. He's not someone you should be with. This treatment is unforgivable and should NOT be forgiven. He's someone you should break up with, immediately, in a PUBLIC place with lots of witnesses around. 

Your Dad is 100% right. Anyone who does these things to you is bad for you. 

Please leave. Please be safe. I'm so sorry these things happened to you. You did not deserve them and they are not your fault but the WILL happen again and again until you leave."
"As an 18 year old girl who grew up with a Father who has anger issues, the best thing he can to for her is apologize. If she bought the makeup herself, he should replace what he broke. He should sit down with her and ask for more information on what asmr is and what she does. Ask her what kind of internet safety precautions she takes, such as keeping her personal Instagram on private, not showing her full name, not telling people her state/province/town. The most important thing is for her Father to be calm during this discussion. After he lets her explain her side of things, he should try to explain why he got so upset. 
“I was afraid something inappropriate was going on, and I reacted with my emotions instead of my logic. Next time I’m confused about what you’re doing I’ll ask you about it. I’m sorry.”

My Dad and I aren’t very close because of his anger, and I’m left with some pretty intense anxiety because of it. If this is a routine thing between your brother and his daughter then you need to look up what verbal abuse can do to a person, and try to convince your brother to go to therapy. As for the video, as long as she feels respected, heard, and safe, I don’t think it will be an issue. After the whole thing calms down and they are on good terms again, I would gently ask her to delete the video."
That would have never occurred to me so I really appreciate this advice. 
I am starting to realize this more and more. I don't *feel* good around him. I hate questioning myself about being over-sensitive.

"/u/travelbug989 makes a really good point. You do not want to be with someone who speaks ill of you.

Talking it out and getting advice from loved ones about how to navigate a relationship issue is one thing. But bad-mouthing and sending screenshots of conversations is a breach of privacy and very disrespectful to you."
She wants to have a relationship on her terms. You will be in a world of hurt the longer you stay with her and she sends mixed messages.
those articles have less to do with abusive behavior and more to do with lack of emotional labor. I would encourage her to check out loveisrespect . org and take the quiz.

"For what it's worth, I really respect your calm demeanor in this type of situation. I see that a lot of people on this thread don't like this because it makes them uncomfortable by challenging everything they know and feel. That being said...I am one of those people, but it doesn't mean I can respect your personal view on it. I agree that it does need to be brought up because if your marriage is as wonderful and strong as it sounds, then you will get through this. He does need to know, however, that this hurts you. Talking through this and finding forgiveness for him will make your marriage even stronger in the end. That is, if you are able to find forgiveness (which it seems like you have already done). This kind of thing always comes to a head at some point, but that doesn't mean it has to be the end. Personally, I would lose my shit, but I am also not married and don't have kids so I can't completely relate.

"I'm actually going to upvote but disagree with this comment because it clouds the issue. It's not a matter of if OP's girlfriend loves him or not. It's entirely possible that she does, in her own way.  

To paraphrase one of my favorite movie quotes, it doesn't matter if she loves him or not. How she feels only matters to her. It's how one treats the people they say they love, that's all that matters to them. It's the only thing that really counts.  

OP, it's a dangerous mental game here to try to argue that you should break up because she doesn't love you (whether that argument is something you have only in your own mind or actually with her). She may truly love you, she may not. You (or she) can probably come up plenty of examples or stories that suggest she does love you. I'd just go ahead and make it easy and assume she does. What matters though is that she betrayed you in a way that should not be tolerated. Her level of love while doing it, or now, isn't important. You really have no choice but to leave her."
"Selfish, lazy, unemployed and insults your appearance. Why are you with him again?"
"&gt; I do like her a lot but I guess with our DND group drama I've just been holding off asking her out...

Just ask her out on a date, man.  Fortune favors the bold, and you could miss out on a good thing by waiting too long.  "
His actions are quite.... frightening. 
It's ok to outgrow somebody. Even a boyfriend of six years.
"Personally, I'd just go do a separate Thanksgiving with your gf if you can't trust your racist mom to not make a scene at Thanksgiving dinner. Show your gf that you prioritize her by not subjecting her to this toxic environment. "
"theres a chance he could have been a worse person two years ago than now. plenty of people go through life changes where they realize they were very mean or inconsiderate and they just become much better people. theres a good chance hes as good as you thought he was now, hed just changed and used to be meaner and then realized his immaturity. i doubt he thought she was really fat, he was probably just trying to garner a reaction at the time. you couldve helped him change too. your kindness and good nature could have taught him to be a much better person. he probably even forgot he even wrote that comment"
"She should be pissed.

When you go out together there is an implied contract for communication and planning.  You failed that.  Completely.  If you cannot handle a night out then it is on YOU to either make accommodations, communicate your issue, or let people know in advance to not count on you.  You did none of that.

Yes, this may have been a medical issue.  Still not a get out jail free card.  Think of this like someone with a seizure disorder.  If they are driving a car and have a seizure they can still crash their car and hurt people.  They will still be held accountable for their actions.  Which is why people with seizure disorders usually don't drive cars.

Going to a club is probably not going to work for you.  A quieter option with some preplanning and escape options would be a better pick.  And apologize to that girl.  "
Thick thongs also work!
"Giving each other rides, cool.
Work together, cool. 
I dont think its cool to invite a young girl over when he has a newish-born and a gf that he could be spending time with. If he gave you the heads up, or brought her to meet you, I wouldn't be too concerned. I think telling him youre only comfortable to have her around when you're home is not unreasonable. This is your home too, and you have a say. "
It’s also exhausting. Trying to have quippy comebacks to keep up or reading between the lines because they’re insincere. 
"Girl, a year ago you were complaining about this dude not spending any time with you and now you're complaining that he expects you to pay for everything. 

Dump him!"
"A teacher who makes remarks about women and autism in his class, then gives different instructions to female and male students and is needlessly aggressive with the female students when they ask for help, *absolutely deserves to get in trouble*. 

And OP should not put herself in another situation where she's alone with him and his aggression in the hopes that it will solve the previous situation with him rewriting reality about what happened when she was alone with him and his aggression."
"There's no way to know if he's into it because femdom reasons or if he just likes being pegged, without asking him. I would sit him down during non-sexy time and talk about it. Don't pre-load with ""This isn't because I'm tall, is it?!"", just ask open ended questions like ""why do you want me to do this/what do you get out of it?"" Some guys just really like butt stuff because, I'm given to understand, prostate orgasms are A++.

Also maybe tell him that springing completely new things on you during sex is out of bounds. That's a recipe for making things awkward, because even for someone who is totally fine with it, you'd need to stop and ask questions like ""have you done this before? Do you need warm up with smaller toys?"" "
"I am so sorry for the loss of your friend. I know the pain. I wish I could say something to relieve even just a bit of it but I know I can't.

I completely understand being overwhelmed by this type of situation. Please learn from my experience.

Go. You will regret forever not going to her funeral. It may seem like self-care to avoid the bad feelings in the moment, but it is self-sabotage. Your friend deserves for you to be there to honor her memory and support her family. 

You have no obligation to talk to her boyfriend. If you can, meet up with a mutual friend and stay in close proximity so you seem unavailable to talk to people you don't choose to.

I've had my share of very painful interactions at funerals with people I'd hoped I'd never see again. I just grit my teeth and took it, and I'm glad when I did. The day wasn't about me. I never regretted staying strong for the people who were there suffering even more than I was for the loss. You'll be proud you were the bigger person, even if he does talk to you. You don't have to be fake, you can just cry and express your loss to him. He has caused this loss and he will face the consequences for the rest of his life. He deserves to. 

Just think about her. Be brave for her. Be love for her loved ones. You won't regret it."
"&gt;If she can’t get over this, you need to part ways. Life is too short to bottle up something so beautiful in yourself for someone else’s ego.

This."
"My parents did this with my ex. He was 26 I was 19. I was dumb in love. They had to grit their teeth and give their approval to him proposing hoping it would fall through. It did and it will op. The worst case scenario is that it falls apart and your son gets hurt. The best thing you can do is be there when it happens. 

Please listen to this. This is the only way to get out of this. As someone who was your son kill her with kindness until your son comes to his senses."
"&gt;&gt;But he keeps trying to kind of cajole me into joking about it. Calling me Slugger. Teasing me about it. Downplaying it. I once said he was abusive and he scoffed at it. He said we are both abusive. I told him I never touched him until he started choking me and he tries to pretend he doesn't remember the sequence of events (I've never in my life touched him other than the 2 times he choked me).

Dude who abused me did exactly the same thing. Made it into *our* abusive behavior, not his (in order to get me to take partial responsibility). Made it into a joke. Didn't remember his actions and how he escalated. Choked me. Wouldn't accept the term abuser. Equated his hitting me (he's much larger/stronger than I am) to my trying to defend himself. Hinted that a physical reaction is just punishment for nasty words in a fight (totally ignoring that he could, literally, kill me). Wanted to stop dwelling on the ""negative energy"" around my being pissed that he would lay hands on me.

They're all the same, the script is always the same. Leave a dude who does this. Therapy, according to Bancroft (see: Why does he do that? Inside the minds of angry and controlling men) only teaches abusers how to better abuse their victims. He also says that abusive men do so because they believe they have a right to do so, and this is a very difficult mentality to get past."
It is widespread and underreported. A philanthropic organization my friend was heavily involved with banned a member who touched a drunk girl while she was sleeping. Unfortunately they didn't report it to any higher authority. Stuff like this need to be reported and properly handled by universities and police.
"I think it's your boyfriend

&gt;With me, my boyfriend had to beg them to meet me just once and they seemed to like me but they’ve never made any effort to want to get to know me since. As I’ve said before I’ve literally met them once in almost 3 years of dating. 

They arent gonna dislike you before they know you. And if they seemed to like you they probably do. It seems like your bf doesnt want you around them for some reason

Chore lists aren’t a thing you should do *to* him. You should sit down and have a discussion: “These are the things that need to be done. How should we split these responsibilities?” 
"Exactly. 32 years old and this guy has somehow ""missed"" the parts of his life where no one does that on a regular basis ?

Gimme a fucking break, he knew exactly what he was doing and is now playing dumb in an attempt to get out of being called-out for being gross to the poor hairdresser.

Absolutely plain and simple."

"She is being awful towards you. Your partner should lift you up, and she is so viciously tearing you down. What’s most heartbreaking is that you would even consider giving up something that makes you happy (and is harming no one) for someone who has shown such a lack of respect for you. You sound like a nice and empathetic person from your post, you deserve better "
"What you're describing is emotional abuse. He is using these periods of emotional tension to control you into behaving the way he wants you to behave. You mention that you feel like you walk on eggshells, that you aren't allowed to express emotion, and you feel your relationship is threatened during these periods. You go to great lengths to avoid them. You feel you cannot bring up your issues with the relationship because he gives you the silent treatment, and his behaviour when angry frightens you.

Honestly, this does not describe a man who is 'amazing 90% of the time.' He is amazing as long as you behave the way he wants you to. He uses his anger and volatility to control you. 

You should sit him down outside of these episodes and tell him you want couples' counselling. If he reacts in anger, you leave. If he treats you this way *leave.* Tell him that when he's ready to talk to you like an equal partner then you will be willing to talk things out.

The fact of the matter is, he is seeing how far he can push you to compromise your own values. If you continue this relationship the way it is, you are heading for a lifetime of resentment because this is not a relationship with mutual respect. You will grow to resent being in a relationship where you can't talk honestly about your feelings with your partner."

"This is absolutely the right place to post this. I'm so sorry for what you're going through right now, it sounds devastating. 

&gt; How can I go back to work/and school and pretend that internally my heart isn’t shattered and I’m utterly lost now.

Don't pretend. The only way you're going to get past the feelings is by going through them, allowing yourself to feel them, and coming to terms with the new changes in your life. You're allowed to be sad, to be depressed, to cry. 

Also, treating your body and mind well will help; make sure you're getting quality sleep, exercise, and food. A therapist could also provide some great support.

I wish you the best. It'll be hard, but you'll get through this."
"&gt; The issue is my boyfriend is actively seeking these women out to look at, following about 75 new women every month.

"You could simply say, ""Thanks but we aren't having kids"" and then change the topic. If they ask why, and they likely will since they're kids, you can simply say, ""Oh, a lot of reasons...."" or ""Because we just aren't"".

That being said, your SIL is a garbage person for what she said to you:

&gt;Last night she asked me if I was jealous that another SIL was on her seventh kid when I couldn’t have any

How insensitive can she possibly be that she'd think that was an appropriate thing to say to you?! Either a) you aren't jealous at all because you don't want kids, or b) you ARE jealous because yeah, you want kids and can't have them. Either way it's none of her damn business and I'd be quick to remind her of that the next time you see her.

A simple, ""Why you thought it would be appropriate to tell my personal medical business to other people whom I actively chose NOT TO TELL is beyond me. But this topic is not up for discussion, ever. Never mention it again.""

So sorry OP. You're basically being forced to tell people now, but I guess it would happen eventually if they're constantly pestering you about kids anyway. All you can do is keep it short and sweet and refuse to discuss it further with anyone beyond, ""Yep, no kids for us!"" Whether you're sad, angry, elated, relieved about that is between you and your husband, not his nosy family.

" I got married and lived happily ever after until my husband was in hurt in the military. I spent six years being a full-time caregiver for him. He passed away in 2012, we were married for 11.5 years.I moved to a different state and started my life over again. Got cancer in 2015. Bought a motorcycle to reward myself for beating said cancer and now I work at volunteers of America helping other veterans. 

My mom, stayed crazy and tried to bring me down to her level many times..saying I was her only daughter and should help her by enabling her self destructive behavior. I turned my back on her and told her when she grows up we can have a relationship again. I'm still waiting. 

That's the short version.

"This should be a much higher comment. I personally think this relationship is too new and OP’s girlfriend is too young. But he mentioned “getting married in spring of 2020” in his post. Christmas 2018 to May 2020 (assuming they graduate in May) is like 16 months, which is a perfectly normal amount of time for planning a traditional wedding - especially for a popular month like May. 

It’s valid that OP isn’t ready, but he needs to be a better communicator. His girlfriend was open with him about being ready for him to talk to her parents. Her friends are being silly, but if they’ve had a good relationship so far then maybe she deserves the benefit of the doubt. 22-year-olds do wacky things, and her friends may have taken upon themselves to talk to OP without asking.

"You need to actually have a conversation about it apart from trying to initiate sex. You need to use I statements to share your feelings, that you need and want sex more often. Then ask him about what he thinks is going on and listen to him. He may not know, many people with a downturn in libido have no idea why it's happening. You may need to bring in outside sort like a counselor, sex therapist or doctor to work through this. But it has to start with a conversation.

And they can also be self depreciating about their own humour or the way they talk and that can really break down barriers.

I come from a very sarcastic, biting family.  Its was our love language to shoot each other down and make fun of each other.  I never thought it was toxic.  When i went to university, i learned the hard way how people responded to how i was.  Here is my number 1 all time tip for this: learn empathy.  remember that what you think isn't hurtful or offensive still can be to others.  learn how to be polite.  When you have that, you can combine it still with your sarcasm and mind so that you aren't changing your personality, you are just adding something to it to make it more palatable to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, you don't need to change jobs because i believe people are fluid and their perception of you can change with more interactions in which you follow the rules i say to my kids: Think before you speak: is it kind, is it helpful, is it necessary, is it true. "
"This would all bother me too. And based on what you've said in the comments, he does not sound like the right person for you. He's happy to some day share your income, but not share in celebrating your successes. "
"I definitely see him having some hurt pride and a touch of emasculation. He was likely extremely excited to take you out, had this whole planned evening, and had some expectations for your reaction but it obviously got completely shut down because you’re so familiar with the place already, learning that your half brother owns it. 

It’s definitely something he needs to personally work through. It could be that gifting and planning things for you is a large way of his way of showing love, and basically he got shot down.  He could be feeling badly for “failing” to provide for you and also worrying about what he could possibly do in the future for you if he might accidentally book your brothers hotel or buy flowers from your brothers business. 

He’s still young and will need to work on building security in that what he’s bringing into the relationship is “enough” and being accepting to the idea that you are happy to just enjoy how things go with him. "
"Also - limit the information you give her. If she asks where you're going, be vague. 'Just running some errands.' or 'Oh, I have a date with (boyfriend.)'

"And also he's paying for everything for both of them and she doesn't want him to leave his cushty job so she can continue being ""a freelance artist"" and pursuing her hobbies. 

OP, you've said you don't want to break up with her, but she's given you an ultimatum. Either you break up with her, or you abandon your hobby, which is actually taking off and could lead you to your dream career.

OP, picture this. You're looking back on your life as an old man. You decided to stay with your girlfriend, after all, you loved her. But not anymore, you resent her now. She made you give up everything you loved. You had opportunities to make a life for yourself that you would be proud of and pursue your dream career. You had opportunities to give up the 9-5 ratrace and become a successful scriptwriter, and be happy every day at work. But you gave it all up for your girlfriend. Because she was jealous, because she wanted to continue persuing *her* hobby while you paid for it. Because she would rather have her boyfriend slave away, miserable, so she can be happy at home mooching off you. You don't love her anymore at 80 years old, you despise this woman. She represents everything you had to give up to be with her.

The other option is much happier: you took her ultimatum and you decided you won't give up what you love again! She's acting exactly like your parents did, forcing you to give up the thing that makes you happy and gives your life meaning for her. You stand up to her and tell her ""No"". Her passive-aggressive manipulation didn't work. Because think about it dude, she's manipulating you. No loving, supportive partner asks you to choose between your dream and them, because they're by your side cheering you on! Especially now that you have opportunities! And you're gonna give those opportunities up? For a woman that's been nothing but cruel to you about your work. 

Sure she was supportive to begin with, when it didn't make her realise how poorly she's doing in life and when it didn't interfere with you paying all her bills. But now she's been trying to drag you down, question your work, hurt you (those tweets are not jokes and not something a loving partner would do) and destroy your self esteem but it hasn't worked! Now she's pulling a last ditch effort to get you under her control.

Think about it. You're 80 and you've become a celebrated screenwriter. Your movies have been box office successes and you're popular in Hollywood and rich. The only times you've worked in the last 45 years were because you wanted to, because this is the career you love to do. And sitting by your side is your wife, an elderly woman who has given you kids and supported you. She's not your current girlfriend, she's a woman you met later on. She supported you from the start, and gave you love and warmth and cared about you instead of dragging you down. She's the best woman you've ever met, and you have the best career you've ever had and the best life. 

And if you give it up now for your girlfriend....it will never happen. You'll work a 9-5 job for many years, bitter and angry and resentful towards her. What if she cheats on you 5 years down the line? What if she decides suddenly she hates the way you dress, the way you speak? Giving up your dream won't be enough for her, you'll have to give up everything about yourself. And she could always throw it all away in 10 years, and you'll have nothing.

Don't give up on your hobby. Please break up with your girlfriend. She's not only incompatible, she's jealous, manipulative, outright cruel to you, and she doesn't celebrate you and your success, she drags you down to make herself feel better."
"I do like her, I've had a crush on her for a while I just want to respect her friendship and our shared space and don't want to ruin the good thing we all have going..."
"Real classy behavior on his mom's part. At least your bf defended you that time, and followed through with his actions. But I think that he wasn't willing to go to bat for you when it came time for a (I'm guessing fully-funded) family vacay.

His reasoning for why his family doesn't invite you to things is BS, and you know it. Like you said, how can they argue that they ""don't know you"" if *they don't make the time to get to know you.* He seems content to maintain the status quo, and we all know how that bodes for the long-term :\\

Best of luck, OP."
"My first question would be: what does she mean by ""crush""? You obviously have a very precise definition of the word (that it is attraction + feelings), but I don't think your wife would be telling you not to worry, if she truly had feelings for this guy. It sounds more like he impressed her that night, by stepping up. It's attractive when a guy does that, and especially when he's already on the attractive side anyway. But she married you, wants to have children with you, and obviously loves/trust you enough to share that this thing happened to her. It really sounds like her true, deep feelings are all for you.

So maybe the reason you think it's weird, it's because you'd never use the word crush to refer to the women who attract your notice. 

Plus, it's possible that it feels weird because you already think that he did something you should have been there to do. So then on top of that, your wife confesses that what the guy did was kinda hot. 

I think you should chill out, and maybe do something nice with your wife, to keep the romance alive. You know, not the baby-planning, tired-from-work, paying the bills stuff, but the actually hot stuff that made your wife realise she wanted to marry you. "
"I did not go to prom for a lot of the same reasons and never regretted it 

I don’t get your parent’s mindset either... in the big scheme of things what you do in high school isn’t that important. I know a lot of people say this is the best time of your life but it’s really not. College is awesome. Being in your early 20s with no real responsibilities is awesome. Getting a real job where you come home at 5 and don’t smell like grease, have money and a house is awesome. Don’t get down because your teen years sucked, that’s the case for a lot of people and you have a lot of great things to look forward to!"
"I’m American, which is pretty similar in class structure to Canada. 

People don’t talk much about class but it does exist.  It’s about more than money, it also includes social expectations and values. I think this is strongest for the upper class (which I mercifully am not). In a given area you can locate the upper class and find they have certain organizations they belong to, churches they attend, and schools they send their children. The middle class is much more broad a has a huge variety of people so the expectations are fewer and less set in stone. The upper class also tends to be more exclusive. They mostly inherit their money so want things kept as they were, and tend to look down on people who made enough money to enter their circles, but don’t do things the same way (moved in and built a huge house that doesn’t match the local architectural conventions, for instance). In the US we borrowed the term *nouveue riche* for this. 

So in a way your girlfriend is right in saying class is inherited, because the social positions and expectations tend to come along with a huge pile of money your great-grandfather made. However, she’s missing out on the fact that *you can’t keep class without money*. Her family is not upper class, though back a few generations they were. You can’t run with the rich people if you can’t afford their hobbies, their clothes, and their schools. 

She’s obviously been taught by her parents that they are upper class people temporarily embarrassed by the lack of a few millions. This attitude is not going to be helpful for your girlfriend because she can’t materialize the money to make it back where they were, and even if you should amass it for her, you’re not going to want to live in the same places or do the same things her ancestors did (going along with her idea that you have to be born into it). 

Given her concern with class and lack of money to go along with it, I can’t help but wondering...is she trying to use your income to claw back to where she thinks she should be? Were you dating before you started making money? Is she concerned with how much you make and does she try to get you to spend it in various ways you would not if left to your own devices? "
Next time you see her tell her she looks hella thirsty and ask if she wants a glass of water.
He's sweet and loving?? I just read your post about how he treats his mom and frankly I am disgusted you are still with someone like that. He is a piece of shit.
"You have written almost 3000 words describing, over and over, the various ways in which you were basically just along for the ride with her, both of you just kind of doing whatever *she* wanted at the time, which culminated in her switching you out when she got bored of you, and your conclusion after all of that is ""hmm, should I jump to do the first thing she wants me to do""??"
"You overreacted and you’re kind of sounding entitled honestly. This entire post is about what you want, expect, and prefer, and your whole vibe here is “my roommate had the audacity to ask if she could have a small gathering”. And now you’ve written her off as dangerous, a partier? You sound off your rocker a bit. Not to mention your preferences are unreasonable “I prefer one friend over in a blue moon” - alright, that’s fine that’s your preference, but that doesn’t have to be your roommates preference and you can’t behave this way everytime your roommates want to do something completely reasonable and fair in their own home like invite a friend over.

I’d be seriously regretting letting you move in if I were your roommates honestly. Holy. 

Also your whole “I don’t want the party cause I don’t like strangers” preceded by “I’m moving in with two strangers off craigslist” tells me you’re less concerned about the “potential stranger danger” of a get together, and more concerned about having things EXACTLY your way. "
And then they stop inviting her because he tells them she keeps saying no. This is a really negative view of it but.... it’s possible this is actually the situation. 
"maybe repost to r/cringe? ;)


No.. Google the 'spotlight effect'. Over the years you've probably seen friends do a lot of weird shit while under the influence and have forgotten or forgiven it. Your niece has too. Imagine yourself as your niece and if you'd really want an apology years after the fact. 


I get that it's cringy but she accepted your apology and has clearly moved on. You mentioning it again would just make it more awkward.



&gt;I’m dealing with health issues and just ended my job as I couldn’t continue anymore.


It also feels like you're again in an emotionally weak moment and once again you're on the point of spilling too much to your niece.


This time maybe keep it to yourself. "
"I'm sorry. While it's possible that she is really depressed and doesn't know how to handle it, your entire post reads to me like she is in the process of breaking up with you and just doesn't want to say it out loud yet. You live together and she is leaving for weeks over Christmas without discussing it with you, and then moving into a short-term rental, again without discussing it with you?
The argument that they are just showings is ridiculous, she wouldn't be looking at them if she wasn't okay with living apart from you."
"Introduce her to Dr. Bronner's Peppermint or Eucalyptus soaps. They work really well, are all natural and hippies love it. You can use it to wash hair, body and face. That will take care of the funk. As for the pseudo science bs, that is either a dumb phase or this girl is going to start getting into crystals and anti-vaxxing and all kinds of crap that would be hard for me to respect a partner for. I don't know what makes people go in for all of that, but it's a deal breaker for me. "
You are seriously sleep deprived. No wonder you are on edge constantly. You have to figure out a way to get more sleep!
"Dating exclusively *might* be a serious relationship but .... are you going to be his plus one? Will he introduce you to his friends/family? Does he keep you in the loop on what he's up to on a pretty regular basis? 

To agree to exclusivity without ""going all in"" may just be a way to keep *you* off the market while he weighs his options. 

That said, he may need more time. I have spent several years uncommitted between relationships just because I wanted to make sure my head was completely clear. Of course, during that time I never asked for or promised exclusivity. "
It’s an apartment that we all rent. That’s why his outburst was so laughable
"You're going to have to put your foot down. Also, take back your car keys before any of this. She can get around by walking or taking public transportation. 

Either she leaves on her own; you ask your dad(or you) to buy a plane ticket, drive her to the airport, and see her for the holidays; or she better start paying for the utilities she uses because she's basically a roommate living there for free. 

This is an important time for you. It's time you ""flew the nest"". 

If you want to be harsher, see if you can change the locks on your place."
Your boyfriend is a serious creep. 
"&gt;She hasn't blown up or been mean to her face, my mom has been nice and cordial in the past which I'm hopeful for now.

Please do not bring your girlfriend to this, even if she says she doesn't mind going. The holidays are already stressful; all it takes is a few too many drinks to where your mom's true colors and feelings become more outward and/or aggressive.

She's nice to your SO's face, but super disgusting behind her back. She doesn't respect the woman you love because of the color of her skin. 

Plan a different dinner or event, the night after or even on Saturday, with the family who respects and enjoys your girlfriend. You could easily just host it at your place, bring in some pizza, play some games, etc. 

Sooner or later, you're going to have to choose the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with, over your mom. Start choosing her *now* before your mom potentially ruins your wedding, your baby shower, your new house, family-get-togethers with the in-laws, etc (Which she will. No doubt about it). 

It's not going to be a one-time thing. The longer you guys are together, and the longer she keeps on getting her way (AKA seeing you alone), the worse she will get. "
"Your relationship seems exhausting. I think she's already checked out and is just unable to say the words, ""I want a divorce."" "
"You could just ask him about his fetish with genuine curiosity. He will probably tell you about it, why he waited to tell you, and anything else you might want to know if you let him have a judgement-free environment/vibe.

He probably waited because of the stigma and he may have been dumped over this in the past or really needs someone he trusts."
....well that's fucking shitty of him.

But it's not her responsibility to educate these men. Women don't need to teach men how to behave like respectful human beings.
"&gt;“I know you made mistakes, but he’s a real dummie for how he’s always treated you.”

This is such a dad comment/thing to say. I'm sure your ex was a dummie and I'm glad you got out. "
"A marriage like yours is my ultimate nightmare. Stay at home mom to two young kids and then **BAM** find out your husband is miserable and doesn't think the marriage can even be saved, *without him ever communicating dissatisfaction.* I can't imagine what that was like for her.

You could have protected her from your negative thoughts better and hid the notebook. When I don't want someone to know about something, I certainly don't leave all the evidence out in the middle of busy common areas."
This is true. I have been to “wealthier” friends’ condos that were an absolute filthy mess because they literally never learned how to clean up after themselves. They were spoiled and usually had someone else to do it for them their whole life...
"If you're already looking for a new job, I'd honestly, just do your best to ignore it for now until you do land that next job. You can try and call him out when he says rude things, but that can just as easily backfire."

"Not unreasonable at all. Your partner should be your biggest cheerleader. Sounds like he honestly does not care about your achievements (as someone who did their undergrad in math, I applaud you) or he's envious of your success. Either does not bode well for long-term happiness in a relationship. Sit him down and have an honest talk with him about his behavior, but, in all seriousness, you should be with someone who supports your success, not looks down upon it."
"He's basically saying he could have raped you if he wanted to. Yeah, I'd classify that as a red flag. He shouldn't be asking for extra praise for not doing something terrible to you."
"I feel like other people have answered this question well, so if I may, can I ask a question that is genuine and has no hateful intent - how were you ready to date again so quickly after losing your husband?

As I say, no judgement WHATSOEVER, I’m genuinely curious. My mother was made a widow when I was 7, and it took her over 10 years before she was able to even consider thinking of someone else. I’m 26 now, and with the love of my life and future husband. If anything happened to him, I don’t think I’d even be able to function properly, let alone date again after one year. 

What was that process like? Again, I must stress, I have no judgment or hate here. Completely and sincerely interested. "
"Have you considered that John is doing this on purpose to isolate Claire from her friends? Have you ever talked to Claire about his behavior? Because it's very off that he would pick fights with friends of hers instead of just hiding them. Have you considered showing Claire that PM? I don't know that I'd want to marry a guy who was capable of this type of behavior, and, if Claire was abused, she may have a defective picker when it comes to men."
"When I finally worked up enough nerve to tell my mother I was leaving my ex-husband, there was a LONG pause on the other end of the line. I thought: “ok, here it comes. I’m about to be excommunicated from the family forever because divorce is a sin.” Instead she said: “I always felt like a pig farmer married my princess.” 😂😂😂

Fast forward eight years: I have been happily dating my current partner (2 years today!) and my mom’s take on it is: “my princess finally found her prince.” 🥰

Life’s too short to be that unhappy. Get out, get a divorce, heal thyself, move on when you’re ready, meet someone awesome, be happy. That’s my advice (and my experience). Best of luck, OP. "
"Innuendo? He confessed his feelings to her lol. He doesn't respect her, OP, or the relationship."
You’re allowed to close the marriage again.
"Been there. We broke up 

&amp;#x200B;

The straw that broke the camel's back was when she yelled at me because I cut onions for burgers the ''wrong'' way. (She wanted whole discs of onion whereas I cut them in half-moons.). I knew from then on that she had an issue and it wasn't about to go away. I decided not to care anymore, I was checked out like we would go to bed not even touching each other. We broke up a month after and now I am getting married to a very positive and upbeat woman next year :)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't worry about walking on egg shells anymore, I can just be myself and it feels great. "

"My dog doesn't get the point of fetch either. Every other trick is fine, but he just leaves the toy wherever he found it. It's weird. "
This thought had not crossed my mind. Thanks for sharing. It’s more for me to think and reflect on 
"&gt;the guy who was sure that the middle east wasn't real and would have a panic attack when anyone said otherwise;

amazing.

Honestly, were your parents shitty to her? Is there a concrete reason her self-esteem is so low? Or is it just a naturally timid personality combined with, like, the influence of too much advertising? 

You can't save people from themselves, but I would suggest that she get therapy."
"It's always tough when your friend picks someone awful.  It seems that the more you try and help, the more they double down on how they want to stay with this garbage person.

I think you just need to tell your cousin the truth and move out."
"First understand that this isn't going to be a quick thing. Like you are not going to talk to her a couple times and then all the sudden everything is better.

If you really want to help then start by inviting her to sibling hangout dates and show her an amazing time. I take my nieces out to the city and show them around. It's a cool thing being treated like an adult when you are 16. Be respectful and listen to her. Let her talk about her life, her interests, her school, her things. If I was to guess no one in her family ever asked her. She will most likely give you 1 word answers because she is nervous or distrusting or just a standard teenager. Be patient. My favorite conversation icebreakers are things like. So when you grow up where do you want to visit? France? Japan? Etc.

I would avoid the abuse conversation because likely she doesn't want to talk about it. Eventually it might come up, but it shouldn't be immediately discussed. This is something after she trusts you.

Once you establish trust by being reliable and respectful then move to physical activities. Start running together. Maybe sign up for a race. Encourage her to pursue goals and interests. If she always wanted to learn guitar then go sign up for lessons together. Basically, you need to be an example how a positive male behaves around women. Basically, the same idea as guys should lift/work/study and  be self-disciplined can be applied to women. Being strong = confidence 

Don't act like an authority figure. Act like a person who loves her and shows her respect. Be a positive influence by setting an example of how to live your life instead of demanding it.

If you reconnect successfully and the situation is as bad as you say it is then she should move in with you. Then the dynamic will be different and things will get way more complicated, but that is a conversation for later.

Anyway, it's going to be a lot of work, but it's not the kind of work that's tedious."
"This literally could've read ""My boyfriend threw a tantrum because he's scared he won't get nice enough christmas gifts this year if I help a poor kid who needs it""

&amp;#x200B;

Complete, selfish, jerk."
"Please don't feel bad that you were manipulated by someone older than yourself. You were so young and he groomed you. Now that you're older you're beginning to see his behavior for what it truly is. Your instinct and conclusions are spot on about him. Please know that YOU hold no responsibility for anything that he has done or will do. There is something wrong with him. 

That being said, you need to break up with him. I would encourage you to get in to therapy if you feel any guilt, so that you can learn how to process those feelings and move on. NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT. I also suggest reporting him - you will not get in trouble and he will never be informed that it was you. By doing that you will likely save another young girl from the same experience you had. "
"She traumatized you. She harmed you, she broke your trust. Sometimes nothing can mend trust that is broken in an abusive way.

You need to do what is best for you, and I think that is leaving this relationship. Therapy will help you recover from your PTSD and help you move on.

You deserve a relationship you feel *safe* in, with somebody that you trust. 
"
"I've been in this situation. First you have to accept the unhealthy attributes of his family, they are never going away.

You and your bf have to find common ground on this issue. This is how me and my wife handle visiting her family for Thanksgiving and Xmas. We eat at home first. Then we go over there for a short period of time, maybe a half of a football game. Then we ""go visit my family's house.""

If your family is not accessible make another appointment,a fake one even. But make sure you and your bf are on the same page. 

We do this every year spanning most holidays and gatherings. We always make sure we bring a dessert or tiny gift baskets. This way nobody's feelings are hurt and you and the kids don't have to stay in an uncomfortable environment for too long.

Been doing it for almost a decade now."
Maybe a sex therapist would help. She sounds pretty mixed up. 
"My thoughts exactly. It’s not difficult to figure out where this went. It’s also not difficult to block phone numbers and otherwise tell someone to fuck off. The key is you have to really want them to them to fuck off...

Do what you want, OP, but your intuition has already told you what’s up here. "
"Well it seems from what you’ve written that he simply doesn’t respect you. He doesn’t value your opinion. And he doesn’t respect your knowledge or advice. 

What ways does he explicitly show you respect? In what areas?

Could you imagine having a friend like this? I certainly couldn’t. 

It’s a cliche but couples counseling exists to aid communication in a marriage. 

If you can’t get through to him because he doesn’t respect what you have to say or feel, a third party could facilitate that.

What would you like to see happen? What would be the ideal marriage for you, and what change would you make if you could?

Edit: oh brother I just saw the bit about the flour. Er, that seems pathological.

Throwing away ingredients you need to cook? Brand new bags of flour? And it’s happened more than once, and every time you express displeasure he continues doing it?

This is either a mental health issue like ADD or something else, or he truly doesn’t care how you’re affected by his actions and he thinks he has the right to do whatever he thinks without regarding you. 

Have you ever gotten through to him to stop a behavior that bothered you?"
"Yeah so I was in your wife’s shoes (still kinda am) my kid is 17mo now. This shit is hard. Like real hard. I get that it’s rough on dads too, but it’s nothing compared to the absolute nightmare of hormones you experience after giving birth. Breastfeeding was the by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and when you struggle with it, it can take you to some really low places. I kept thinking I was a shit mom because I didn’t produce enough milk and I was struggling to get baby to latch. Toddlers are mini cyclones with huge emotions, I can’t imagine throwing a newborn into the mix. PPD and PPA hit me like a bag of bricks. It wrecked my self imagne and my outlook on life. I was overwhelmed and suicidal, and the amount of guilt I felt was immeasurable. The best thing I did was talk to a doctor about meds, and then I got into therapy. I still struggle, especially on the days when I’m dealing with the 100000th meltdown of epic toddler proportions, but it’s not like those first 3mo. I can’t imgane what my partner went through, watching me spiral and he had to take up a lot of the slack. But that isn’t unusual, giving birth is ridiculously hard and it takes a toll on us, physically and mentally. Talk to her about meds and therapy, but don’t come off as accusing. I know it’s hard, but please be patient with her. 

And for the love of all that’s holy, if she wants to shower do not suggest she take the toddler with her. It’s not a shower, it’s more like trying to clean a slippery tornado with a mind of its own, also this tornado thinks it’s fun to pinch your nipples while you bend over to wash their hair. I’m speaking from experience btw "
"That is a good idea. Next time there's an officer's meeting, I believe it's next week, I'll suggest agreeing  on official policy about harassment and assault. Regarding both things that may happen at practice, and at parties.

Parties are an odd thing because they're not officially sanctioned by the school, they're not official club events because the school does not encourage underage drinking. But there's kinda an unspoken rule that the school will look the other way, if sports clubs party on their own time. 

(Edit for spelling)"
"&gt;Does it mean anything or is it just drunk ramblings?

Neither - it's just a little window into his sexuality that you probably only got to see because he was tipsy enough to feel comfortable saying it.

I argue that it is helpful to recognize (and appreciate?) that your SO's sexuality can be deeper than what you have established in your relationship so far.  If you can be honest with each other about that it will only help your understanding and trust in each other."
I'd do it for Beyonce.
"&gt; They are just more mature and I feel that their life goals match up better with mine then an average college student.

Now you know that this isn’t always the case. And that there is a high chance that any “older” guys that chase women your age will not have good intentions. The ones who are mature and trustworthy aren’t likely to find much in common with a woman so much younger than them (and will actually care). 

Tell his wife if there’s a way to do it safely. The one who ruined their marriage isn’t you - you’d only be the messenger. If you are too afraid of retaliation to do this, then protect yourself first. You owe him nothing and you don’t have to spend one more moment of your time on him and his bullshit."
"Yes, he’s just looking for a reason to leave"
"Forget Kim for a moment.  You have an abusive boyfriend.  Telling you how to think and feel.  Gaslighting you.  Yelling.  Ignoring you and then love bombing you.  So many manipulative behaviors.  And never once true apology with admission of guilt and a plan to change.

Oh, and he at minimum has a crush on Kim"
"Should you leave a man who wants kids when you maybe don't?

Probably.

Definitely.

All that aside, the part where you had an abortion and are miserable and he wasn't around because he was having a hard time at work...? What?
"
"&gt; but the one person who did do that to her, she SUED FOR DAMAGES.

...do you know who she sued? Is there a record of this? Because if not, I’d take that boast with a VERY large grain of salt. It sounds like exactly the kind of thing a highly manipulative person would say to frighten her associates into submission. 

If you’re truly afraid she might do this, ask a lawyer for advice and find out how she could plausibly come at you. My guess is that she doesn’t have much she could legally do to you. "
"If you can't communicate with her then  you are DEFINITELY not up for it.

""Babe, we need to talk about something. I know you want to get engaged and you got all excited about it with your friends, but the truth is, I'm not ready yet so I don't want to give you false hope. I love you very much and I see a future with you, but I need us to live closer to each other, see each other more often and preferably live together for a while before getting married. Realistically, I see us getting engaged near the end of 2020 / beginning of 2021. If it's a Christmas engagement you want, I will keep that in mind for when I'm ready. I'd be more than happy to gift you some jewellery (a necklace, a bracelet, maybe even a placeholder ring) for Christmas."""

"This is the correct mature answer.

ooooooor you could invite a priest over, some Wiccans, a medium, and a psychic. Do a blessing, a cleansing, some prayers. Of course they won't find anything... but maybe the ""spirit"" is attached to your husband! Maybe he needs an exorcism! LOL"
"Because you’ve upended the relationship dynamic. She’s the *artist*. She’s the *special quirky* one. You’re the boring one that earns the steady money. You’ve broken character. 

I’ll stop there because if I tell you what I actually think of your gf and how she’s behaving you might find it very harsh."

Why are you ok with that? "
"""I had no idea Jenna's boyfriend was 30. However, my point still stands."" 

Because it fucking does. You weren't trying to be catty or passive-aggressive (and seriously, Ellen wasn't even at the party, so her opinion doesn't count for much), but if this 30-year-old guy is feeling upset because other 18-20-year-olds are very vocal about the fact they don't actually like 30-somethings at their college parties...then maybe he should stop going to college parties."
"I don’t know what’s up with the majority of these responses but 100% it’s reasonable to be upset. Your boyfriend sounds unsupportive as hell and there’s no one that doesn’t understand how major it is to get published, like come on. You are absolutely NOT over inflating your own success, you’ve done things to be proud of and shouldn’t feel bad about it. 

You can try to talk to him again but if he’s doing this because he’s insecure, do not take that problem on as your own. *He* is going to have to work on it and if he doesn’t want or care to then it’s time to end it. 
"
"That sums up my feelings about the wedding better than I could articulate. My mom was both ""my mom"" and my dad's wife. Seeing someone else in her ""place"" would be too difficult, at least at this time it is. I doubt that will change in the next 8 months and I don't want any expectations of her coming. She doesn't even know me and this is an intimate wedding of less than 30 people intentionally. It would really stick out for me."
"&gt; but they already have names...

Right? How many names does he need these cats to have? It sounds like it's around 3 names each already, and if she's anything like the rest of us the actual count is higher than that. How many names does he think a cat needs to have before it's official you love it? "
"This is classic - parents dislike you for something your wife did. They are transferring their annoyance at her onto to. It's projecting, no matter what language it's in. Could be Portuguese with a Brazilian accent or Quebec French. It's the same thing. 

Tell your wife that they need to know the score and that she needs to start actually holding them to account with consequences. If they keep acting up then she severs contact/limits their contact/refuses to visit. 

Don't be bulled by people who aren't really mad at you. "
"I mean, if you're ok with him trying to fuck other girls."
"When you’re with someone with a disability it’s not compromising/sacrificing things to be with them. It’s just a part of life. 

Honestly the way you speak about her disability and health. The way you view the changes in your life in order to be with her.  It all speaks as if you’re viewing this entire relationship as a bargaining experiment.  

I’m blind.  Like the majority of blind people, I can see fairly well in the right conditions. I’m sure plenty of people think there’s nothing that much wrong with me.  However my family, my PARTNER, knows damn well my limitations and my inabilities. They know to trust me when I try to communicate that I’m having problems.  

They don’t just brush off my own thoughts and views just because someone else has told them something different. 

That’s what you’re doing with your wife.  Whether you realise it or not you’re constantly belittling her experiences and downplaying her injury.  

Whilst you sit there and say “I did X for you so now you owe me Y” 

That’s bad enough when it’s as simple as “I did the dishes, so now you owe me a foot massage” but you’re going “I lived with you through chronic illness so now you owe me children” 

Children aren’t a compromise because they aren’t a fucking toy.  You can compromise on buying a $4000 tv because even if one person hates it it doesn’t affect anyone around them. 

You’re asking her to deal with chronic pain, a hidden disability and the responsibility of trying to bring up at least one other human being just, and only, because you want to.  

You know what it’s like to be a child of a parent who doesn’t really want you?   Of a parent who has no idea how to communicate with you properly because you’ve never really bonded? 

What about being a parent to kids you never wanted? Yes thousands of people end up in that situation every day, and for those who manage to cope and do it well and grow from it? They deserve credit, but it’s a big fucking gamble deliberately going into a situation like that.  Especially with a neck disability. 

You talk about your resentment of your wife.  But holy shit, she’s with the man she loves who promised to care for her and be with her.  She communicates fairly healthily (from your small example, granted) about problems in your relationship.  And all along you’ve been viewing it as “I do this so you do that” 

"
"Definitely tell the wife if it is the same guy. You see, by not telling, you're making sure that he continues his behaviour. He obviously doesn't care about you, or else he wouldn't lie to you and use you like he did. He is a predator. But if you tell the wife, there will be consequences to his actions. What she does with the information is up to her. But I would tell. "
"&gt;I haven't told my family about this diagnosis because mental health is complicated and I like to pretend that I'm fine.

"My daughter is 9. About a year ago she dropped a cheap plastic crystal in the street somewhere along the 5 minute walk from our house to the bus stop. We looked, couldn't find it, and eventually I said come on, you've got lots of crystals at home. WEEKS later she somehow spots this dull, virtually colorless piece of cheap glam as we are walking home from school. Immediately she like, ""THERE'S MY CRYSTAL!"" like she had just dropped it 5 minutes before. If your daughter is anything like mine, and if she had ever laid eyes on that pearl earring before, I think she would have not only recognized it, but immediately laid claim to it. Trust your kid. Your husband is lying. Now you're going to have to be honest with yourself, because he's obviously not going to be honest with you. "
"Exactly, and it usually is painfully obvious to the other party that the originator feels they are dumber and need to be talked to in this way.  It can come across very offensive."

When there's something that costs money that you really want to do, then you can treat him.   Your story about him trying to pay and having his card declined which forces you to pay is a very big red flag.   This guy is not long term dating material.

"
His family doesn't like you (probably because he's very obviously badmouthing you to them) and he ignores you. This isn't worth salvaging. Forget Thanksgiving. Throw the whole guy out. You've got a kid. Don't stay with a guy who treats you like this. Don't let him grow up thinking that's normal or OK.
"Okay, but this is an example of bad communication. You weren't invited, you're clearly hurt about it, but instead of asking him *why* you weren't invited and expressing that you feel left out, you're asking Reddit to read his mind for you. None of us can do that.

If you want to know where you stand with him, you need to talk to him. Communication is what makes relationships successful."
"Yeah, I'm gonna agree with you on this. As a 32 year old going to school on the GI Bill right now, I would feel incredibly uncomfortable drinking at a house party with the kids I go to my classes with and their friends. I've been going to school for over two years now, and I have been to exactly zero college parties. I prefer going out to bars with people my own age to unwind."

I think it's time for him to demonstrate that he wants to get better or you need to explore other options. "

"People are giving him the benefit of doubt but I think there is a possibility this lecturer might have selected you as a target to harass and torment.

He told you to use ""method A"" but has been telling others to use ""method B"" which is of course going to confuse you. If your lecturer is indeed sending you weird vibes, I think you should steer clear away from him from now on because apologising him might push him to torment you even more.

I had an instructor who would make sexist comments and then would teach me wrong methods (or at least methods that would definitely make me fail) Before changing instructors he had started getting verbally abusive too.

I know it doesn't feel like a super serious issue right now, but the fact he brings this up EVERY time he comes over is a red flag. He's 31 for goodness sake, he should be able to move on from this even if he doesn't ""agree"" with your cats' names, whatever the fuck that means."

If you can't stand the sight of either of them, tell your parents that you won't be attending if either of them are. At that point, it's on your parents to make arrangements to see you for the holidays.

"&gt; He punched me in my stomach and so I tried to leave his apartment. He ran after me, threw me on the floor and dragged me back to his room. The rest of the night consisted of this until he tired himself out and went to sleep. 

He kidnapped and tortured you? Get the hell away from him. Alcohol removes inhibitions. 

Post this story in r/domesticviolence and see what experienced people think."
"OP, this is terrifying.  

According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, strangulation is ""a significant predictor for future lethal violence.""

Please talk to people about this in real life (as opposed to online I mean, I know this is real life) and get help."
"This is so wholesome, I'm really glad for you working on your relationship instead of giving up when you notice the problems. You guys sound like marriage."
"If his first reaction to being cussed at includes pushing his 15 year old daughter, I’m scared to see how they’ll manage in the future."
He should replace what he broke regardless of who originally paid for it. Having a fit of anger doesn't mean you get to destroy things you've bought for others and not be responsible.
"I'm 34 and have never driven. I moved to the city and use public transportation.

As a fellow non driver I encourage you to not chauffeur him around. 

I get to work, run my errands, and socialize without driving. My boyfriend has a license but we do not keep a car, too expensive in the city. And we prefer to imbibe so we contract out that designated driver role to the bus driver."
"&gt; he will say, ""I'm rude just once! You don't see all the other nice things I do for you.""

So he's allowed to be rude and disrespectful because sometimes he's nice? That's not how it works. "
I agree totally about her husband making a formal complaint to his boss. Making advances in a professional setting is not okay and his boss will definitely see it as getting in the way of work.
"A high sex drive isn't a medical condition that requires treatment. You both knowing he has a high sex drive doesn't make you obligated to have sex with him if you're not feeling it (for whatever reason, it doesn't matter why.)

He's making excuses for raping you and trying to manipulate you into taking the blame. I'm so sorry he's putting you through all this. "
Yeah this isn't even malicious--it's just responsible. I'd want to know that before hiring someone.
What is an exclusive FWB? That seems really weird to me. No wonder this situation is so confusing. You feel like he should be committed to you sexually but you're not in a relationship. So of course he can joke about sleeping with other women.
"Honey, there is always a first time they hit you, or mock you, or belittle you, or tear you down. It’s up to you to make sure there’s a last time. He’s doing this to make you beg for his approval, which he will continue to withhold as a sort of game. It’s calculated to destroy your self worth so he can treat you even worse. "
"Your girlfriend is not kind...not at all.  She doesn't ""mean well"", she means to be RIGHT.  A kind person would realize that being a know-it-all who verbally insults people's intelligence is tbe opposite of kind.  It is cruel.  She is mean, OP.  And she thinks everyone is dumber than her and beneath her.  It is super unattractive.  And you are being judged for being with someone so arrogant and mean.

You don't need to be gentle, you need to be blunt with her.  ""Gf, if you want people to be your friend, you need to stop being so arrogant and belittling people who have a different opinion than you.  It is rude and mean and poor social skills""."
"To piggyback on this, OP, my friends and family will never hear me talk badly about my wife, nor will they be given details of our arguments (unless we are laughing about it together later with, say, my Dad - he frickin' LOVES her). 

You see, I am an adult, and I know that we will get over our (rare) fights eventually, and I refuse to tarnish how my loved ones see her, because they will remember that shit long after I have forgotten it."
"Your husband need to consider this sexual harassment and report it to HR. He needs to say he is uncomfortable at work due to her. He needs to shut her down, harder and more professionally, ever single time she says something inappropriate or touches him. And every time report it."
"No, it's because we've been shamed about our normal bodily functions our entire lives in a way that men aren't so we have to come up with ways to prevent indicating that we have them."
"I have brought up therapy( individual, couple, marriage, etc) throughout this entire process. He is highly resistant; doesn’t see the need to “pay a stranger” and further, he has always struggled with talking about his private feelings. "
"I stayed with my version of this guy for 5 years, FML."
"Like everyone else says, ask her about it. If you can't discuss birth control with someone, you should not be having sex with them, especially without any form of protection. There are many reasons for what you're observing; maybe she picked up 2 months at once, left one at work to take in the morning, and the pack in her purse is just a back-up in case she forgets to take a pill while at work.

There are also many valid reasons a woman wouldn't want to take Plan B beyond 'trying to trap someone into fatherhood' or whatever. Plan B is hormonally hard on lots of people and not a pleasant experience for a few days. If she knows her body and her PMS symptoms, asking her to go through that to 'humor you' is weird."
"When something similar happened to me, my biggest error was putting off discussing it. It gave my fiancé time to stew and assume the worst, AND made him feel like I didn’t care about the pain he was in.  Your wife is in agony right now. As much as you’d like to, it’s cruel to put off clearing the air."
The bf may also be spineless when it comes to actually standing up to his family and/or love his (I assume) free vacations more than OP
"&gt;There’s a family gathering on Sunday and I feel too embarrassed to go. 

You have nothing to be embarrassed about.   It's your sister-in-law who behaved badly and above all your friend.    

Your husband should talk to his parents asap and ask them why they didn't tell him what his sister was doing.  Let them know that her question and gossiping have pretty much soured *both* of you on the upcoming gathering and that *he* doesn't trust his family to act appropriately about the news.  Let their reaction to that be your guide as to whether or not you go.   

If your husband won't stand up for you in that way, then you should definitely sit this one out.

With respect to your ex friend: I would write her a letter and say that your trust was clearly misplaced and that you not mourn the loss of the friendship.   Then do not engage with her on any level again.  If someone asks why you are no longer friends, be truthful: ""because she liked gossiping about me more than she valued the friendship.""  "
"I hear where you are coming from.  I grew up using tools and camping as well.  I have a couple pieces of advice that might help:

1) You should always notify someone when you go camping where you are and when you expect to return.  That's basic backwoods safety.  If you make your friends the notification people, that could help.  All it takes is a text as you're packing those clothes and food.

2) Smoke detectors are basic home safety.  Your parents should research other smoke detector options that won't be set off as easily.  If you come across as blase about a super basic safety item then they likely worry that you are blase about more serious safety items.  Similar to your finger story.  

3) Be pro-safety in all aspects of your life.  Your friends likely feel like you don't take safety seriously and that they need to be your conscience.  If you show that you're being proactive about safety in the home, while camping, with tools, etc. then they will trust you and relax.  

I think that there's nothing wrong with any of the activities that you're doing and that you grew up in an environment that made them normal.  The downside is that your friends may perceive that you don't take safety seriously, so if you're more visibly safety conscious they may relax."
"This is typical mom life. The first few months is hard. Its seriously about adjusting and figuring out what works for your household. My opinion is to help her out with house work as much as possible, let her know shes doing AMAZING with the babies, and just be there for her! Let her vent and let her know you're there for her. Also, she won't get enough sleep for the next 5 years...lol I've got 3 kids 9yrs old ,8yrs old, and a 6 month old and I can't remember the last time I had a decent nights sleep. "
Don't forget he is now a 29M pursuing a 15F...
"Or maybe he's afraid that he'll lose his job? Or is worrying about retirement, kids, future medical issues? Either way there is something stressing him out about money to the point he's about to snap. I like the idea of a budget to at least get him to unwind a little. "
"You cant start with ""it's been mostly amazing, he treats me awesome and worships me most of the time"" then follow it on with stuff an 18yo dirt bag bf would get up to. He's in his 30s and hasnt grown up and doesnt respect you. "
"&gt; the guy who tried to steal my father's car proposed to her and she said yes AFTER it came to light he had tried to steal a car.

"All I can think while reading this is good for her. Make sure she saves the video in at least 3 places. 

Have you watched the video? Because if you're just repeating what he said it already sounds really fucking aweful for this poor lass, and that's *his* version of events. 

You call it fighting, but sounds like she wasn't fighting until she realised she had some leverage. 

He's the one that needs talking to. Yet for some reason you're all acting like she is the problem for standing up to him. 

Repeat to him that he needs anger management and family therapy or he will probably lose his relationship with his daughter the instant she's no longer reliant on him. "
"Yep even in marriage you should not do this. I remember reading something like ""You might forgive your partner but your family won't"" "
"I'm not sure that I have any advice better than what has already been said (i.e. get him into therapy), but I just wanted to share my own experience. My Dad was like this when I was growing up (still is actually) and it lead to me having to walk on eggshells around him and always being afraid that something would set him off. I felt like I had to manage his emotions, which was really stressful for me as a child. It has absolutely affected our relationship and the way I view him to this day. Know that if he doesn't change his behavior he will damage his relationship with your daughter."
"Yeah, that’s not okay. Calling people crazy for having feelings is such a trashy loser thing to do and it’s abusive. You’re not crazy for crying when he says cruel stuff to you, it’s a normal human response. People can get snippy when they’re stressed, but his behavior goes beyond that. "
"That's how a lot of parties are for people in their 20s, regardless of whether they're in a relationship or not. I'm only a year younger than your friend group and I can't remember the last party I went to where I stayed later than 11. Even if you hosted on a Friday night, people are more tired after a week at work, and a lot of people end up having weekend plans. Sounds like you had a good time, I wouldn't overthink it."
"OP, your dad sounds like a miserable and judgmental person.

You're a father now. He's provided an example of how *not* to parent your own child. Be the father you wish you had, and shower your child with love.

That also means, you don't subject your kid to people who look down on them and won't love them like you do! This means Grandpa has to prove himself to *you* before he meets your kiddo.

* Prioritize your family -- Start right now with Thanksgiving. Do not go to Thanksgiving at your father's house. Spend it with friends or at home with your new little family. **Sisters and mother can travel to where you are if they really are set on seeing you.**

* Decline driving your mother for visits during times you don't feel up for it. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

* Encourage visits with your sisters and initiate outings together away from the family home.

* Got any Aunt/Uncles who will complain for not seeing you at family gathers at your parents' house? Well, carve out time to actually go visit them and cutting out the middle man."
"So. I’ve been in a very similar position to your wife. I am a woman with invisible disabilities. In my case, my husband and I went into marriage being fairly certain we did not want kids, but he changed his mind. At first, he said he wanted to grow old with me and that he would put his want to be a dad aside. 

Eventually, he started to express sentiments very much like the ones you express in your post and comments, OP. The compromises he had to make for my illnesses started to feel like more of a burden than they had before. Added together with his desire to be a dad, it felt like he was sacrificing a lot for me.

He started to pull away from me emotionally before he really explained it all to me. He made new friends and began heavily prioritizing time with them over time with me. It hurt a lot and made me feel anxious and insecure.

We went to marriage counseling, and that was where his feelings about sacrificing for me came out. And it was crushing for me.

Being disabled is a hard thing. You want to do more than you are physically able to, so you often feel disappointed and frustrated with yourself. You lose parts of your dreams, parts of your identity. In your wife’s case, she used to be an equestrian. She used to be a dancer. Those parts of her identity are gone now, and that hurts. Being disabled is a process of mourning and trying to accept reality and make new identities for yourself. It’s hard. 

And then to find out that your partner feels that being with you is a sacrifice. You’re giving everything you can to the relationship, and it’s not enough—your hard-fought contributions apparently are not appreciated when balanced with the compromises he has to make to accommodate your disability. So there’s another part of your identity gone. Good wife. Valued person. He used to say he was lucky and proud to be married to you, but now you’re just the burden dragging your husband down.

It’s crushing, emotionally, to feel that way. It destroys your self esteem to find out that’s how your partner feels—that you are not a partner to them, but a burden. 

My husband and I are close to finalizing our divorce now. He has waffled a lot about whether to go through with it, but I’ve been more certain about it since all of it came out. I loved him with everything I had, but it felt like a betrayal how he seemed to be blaming me for not being able to provide everything he wanted. I’ll acknowledge that being disabled causes difficulty in a relationship, but my disability is not my fault, and if my partner is going to be unsupportive and tell me that my struggles are such a burden to him that being with me is a sacrifice, then I’m better off alone. Even though I’m completely miserable alone. 

Think hard about your future and make up your mind. Is being with her sacrificing what you want out of your future? Is she more of a burden to you than a partner? Really think about it, before you break her heart. "
"He can’t just keep denying that there’s a problem. There IS a problem - you’re uncomfortable and unhappy and can’t go about your day-to-day life without being questioned. This is ridiculous and unsustainable.

First, you need to talk about trust. He’s assuming that you’re careless with money, when in fact you’re very careful. Why is this? Why does he feel like he gets more say over household purchases than you do? You’re equal partners and both contributing to the household, and he needs to trust that if you make a purchase you are being thoughtful and staying in budget.

Second, you need to have a larger conversation about your household budget. What are your goals as a couple? Are you saving enough for retirement? Once your savings are covered, you need to set money aside into catagories, which should things like furnishing your house. It is a good idea to each have an allowance to spend on fun things so that each person is free to buy a few fun things that make them happy. However, being a woman is simply more expensive than being a man, and you need to be free to buy things like tampons and makeup without being questioned. Those don’t fit into your allowance.

It is really concerning that your husband is trying to exert this crazy level of control. I’d really consider marital counseling in addition to your budgetary discussions. The way that he’s acting is ridiculous and totally unsustainable."
"Drinking game: Go on r/relationships and take a shot every time someone comments ""GET OUT OF THERE NOW"", ""THIS IS A RED FLAG"", ""THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR"", or suggests breaking up.

"Yes, you should dump him. Taking pictures of random people down the street would be it for me, that's just creepy and violating.

Also, I guarantee if he isn't cheating already he is definitely flirting. I'd hate to be the girl that everyone is looking at with pity because she's in the dark about her slimball boyfriend. "
"If you are going to be buying a house with him you ABSOLUTELY have a say in it. ""I understand that this isn't my house, but when its OUR house, these are things that I WON'T tolerate and passively mentioning something and having it laughed off will not do. I need to know that you have my back in this, and that I won't get into this large investment with you only to have my privacy constantly invaded. We are ADULTS. We need SPACE"""
"I'm torn on this one as I also love gift-giving, but I think you should go ahead and give him the Kindle. Preface before you hand it to him by saying that you bought it before the conversation about gifting because you come from a background where gift-giving is the norm, and explain why you chose it for him - because he loves reading, and at the moment can't get his hands on many new books. Stress that you got the Kindle because you care about him and thought he would find it useful, not because you're expecting a gift in return. 

Some comments are being unnecessarily harsh on him, IMHO - there are people who just genuinely do not like gift-giving, and that's totally OK! It sounds like your boyfriend is more into experiences and spending time with you - that's just who he is as a person. If you're OK with that, then I see no further issues here. Romantic sunset picnics sound lovely :)"
If she is not going to other people's birthday parties why would they go to hers?
"&gt; Should I stay and try and make things work?

Fuck no.

His attitude is ""this is who I am"" and when it's obvious you don't care to be married to the drug addict version of him his next reaction is ""so go, then.""  

If there was any chance of making this work, it would look like him begging for another chance, promising you the moon and the stars, and getting his ass into rehab immediately and taking complete accountability for his problems.  He's going in the opposite direction from that.  You even did all that couples counseling, and had him be in addiction counseling, and he's stopped bothering with any of that.

And no, the progress he apparently made before is irrelevant.  In fact he as much as admitted that it was fake and for your benefit when he said he ""tricked you into marriage."" 

This is not you giving up, this is him not giving a fuck what it's like to be married to him.

Gosh, what could he ever see in her ...

At any rate, realize that when push comes to shove she will likely side with him over you. You are not on the lease, so she could end your sublet arrangement and kick you out. But you mentioned earlier that you're leaving soon anyway. Might be time to accelerate those plans and move out at the same time that you tell her you can't be her maid of honor (which you're going to do, right?).

"Then it’s ultimatum time, because a) you most likely wouldn’t have pursued the relationship if this was the case from the beginning and b) you’re probably less than excited about putting up with the ‘funk’ long term.

This demonstrates quite clearly that he sees you as an object.

Otherwise what would your picture have to do with his own worth?

"Separate finances. Isolate yourself from the impact of him giving her all of his income.

Your BF can be in your family or hers, but you are not in a family with her and never will be. Make that clear, and separate finances accordingly. If you ever need to go no contact you can just tell her you both lost your jobs and are going to be homeless. She'll find someone else to pay her bills."
"Honestly, going on a trip to Greece is not going to help your friend get her shit together. It sounds like she doesn’t currently have custody of her child. How does taking an expensive vacation help her to stabilize her life so that she can achieve that? Does she have a good place to live? A stable job? If you want her to turn over a new leaf, these are things to focus on, not a trip to celebrate her breakup. I appreciate wanting to support your friend, but if I were your boyfriend, I would also have a hard time with “The only way I can support my friend is to take an expensive, last-minute vacation to Europe with her instead of going to Thanksgiving with your family.”"
"I think this is a conversation that would be good to have together in couples counselling, because it sounds like you have several issues in relationship and children is just a part of it.

It sounds like you're downplaying/devaluing her injury/disability, by focusing on how it looks and not what she's telling you (

&gt;She's legally disabled, but if you saw her walking down the street you would never guess anything was wrong. Aside from the fact that I have to handle moving anything heavy around the house, she's totally independent and holds down a demanding, well-paying, full-time job at a company that regularly recognizes her as a strong contributor. However, she has had to quit horseback riding, dancing, and most exercise except light strength building in her neck and shoulders. She does still have days where she's in a lot of pain, too.

As a person with an illness that severely affects my life without being visible to others, I know how hard this can be. It often comes with anxieties about how you're perceived, anxiety that people think you're faking it for attention, over-compensation on good days that drains your energy, and it's also sad to not be able to do all the things you want to do. Your wife had to quit physical activities that probably gave her joy, and that sucks. It drove me into deep depression to realize my shortcomings due to illness, and people that I've talked to in support groups all had similar experiences to the point where some considered their life now to be meaningless.

On top of this, it sounds like you're blaming her for this, for robbing you of the life you wanted. She probably picks up on this, and that's probably not healthy for your relationship.

It sucks if she truly doesn't want a child, because that would make you less compatible, but her concerns are legitimate. I love my kid, and most days I'm happy that me and my partner decided to go for it in spite of some health related concerns. But pregnancy was one of the worst experiences of my life, in a way that I couldn't possibly have been prepared for. And after having my child one of my illnesses got worse, and at times it's so bad that I end up resenting my child for needing my care and attention, when I'm in too much pain to provide it. There was a period when my kid was nearly 1 year old when I was unable to carry it, or even hold it in my arms while sitting, and it hurt my soul.
My point is that if you have a child your wife will undoubtedly love it, because it's hard not to love your own child, but if she feels pushed to do it she will also at times probably resent the pusher. And so a conversation with an objective and trained third participant is probably a good idea, so that you can both be sure that you are making the best desicion for each of you individually and the both of you as a couple."

Don't give him the hope that you might change you mind. Its just going to cause a lot of hurt later down the road. Just my two cents. 

Also dont settle because you dont think there are other equally awesome and like minded people out there. We exist! I just wish some on had told me sooner. I spent so much time in bad relationships or hurting my partners because I was scared and figured I would be alone forever due to my want to be CF. "

"Your rage and heartbreak are totally understandable and valid.

Your friend's boyfriend's family have valid reasons to be heartbroken, too. Assuming that the blame lies entirely with him, they are now facing the incredibly painful, shameful reality that their son/brother/nephew caused the death of another person, and confronting the very real possibility that he will serve prison time for it. They may also be reckoning for the very first time with the possibility that their loved one has an alcohol problem. At the very least, they're having to come to grips with the fact that he used terrible judgment and someone else paid the ultimate price for his mistake.

Also, and this is really important, if they're raising money for legal fees you can bet they've been advised against saying *anything* on Facebook that sounds like an acknowledgment of his guilt. Just because they aren't coming out and saying, ""Our son made an awful mistake and we're devastated for his victim's family"" doesn't mean they aren't in fact devastated for her family.

Stay off their Facebook for the foreseeable future. Do talk to your therapist and surround yourself with friends. Go to the funeral and know you don't need to interact with him or his family.

I'm so sorry for your loss."

I actually have some experience with this as my brother passed away when he was nine as well. We ended up turning his room into a sort of family room. It was hard to move everything out but we kept some of his things there and it was really nice to be able to spend time in there as a family, it felt like he would've liked that. Maybe that would work for your family too. 
Maybe speak to your wife about these options and then include your daughter in discussions as well, I'm of course a bit biased since i was in her position but you'll want her to be comfortable with what happens to that room as well. 
Best of luck, and I'm so sorry for your loss. "
"Dude she invited strangers over to your house to fuck, even after you said no, and then let them come hang out anyway while you moped in another room.

This woman doesn't give a shit about your feelings or boundaries or safety or a billion other things. 

This is INSANE. Get the hell out of there. "
"To answer your question, no.

- he became abusive over *keys*

- he's threatened to either leave you or cheat on you with his ex over *keys*

- he disrespects *everybody* over **keys**

What happens when you *actually* mess up - and you will *actually* mess up at some point because  I'ma assume you're human. Don't stick around to see what kinda abuse he hurls when you actually make a mistake."
"First off, when hiking in a group, you should go as fast as the slowest member for safety reasons. More experienced hikers might be comfortable splitting up a bit more, but if you're inexperienced that should be taken into account. 

He was impatient and rude. Even if you are sensitive, that's not necessarily a bad thing. People tend to get more irritable the longer a situation goes and he sounds like he's lost his patience. If he cant discuss these problems with you, it really might be a good idea for you to take a step back and think about how the relationship is affecting you. You shouldn't be crying every other day. I've been there and it's not how life should be with someone you love."
