He should‚Äôve told her you can‚Äôt cry over spilled milk.
Yeah good customer service can only go so far before customers will just decide to take advantage of you 
"&gt;  Do you have any idea how important I am?

""No, because you won't give me your ID."""
So basically you met a serial killer today. 
"I‚Äôm going to speculate that he knocked her up and they‚Äôre doing a shotgun wedding. I really don‚Äôt see any other reason for 1) him eager to marry that, and 2) shopping for a ring together and she doesn‚Äôt seem halfway interested."
"And she was only kicked out, I wonder how would she react if she had to pay for the jeans."
"I heard an ad on the radio yesterday literally reminding people that service staff aren't below them and to treat them with respect.  Not sure who paid for that ad but fucking hell it's upsetting that people even need that reminder. 

I'm sorry for your experience. Please make sure you seek counselling if you need it, that is an incredibly upsetting thing that has happened."
"""Just because you're not on the clock doesn't mean you get to stop doing your job!""

""Actually, ma'am, that's the definition of not being on the clock."""
That was quite the ride. I have no words.
"You could have gotten angry at her but you showed compassion and empathy and possibly put her on the right direction to get better. 
You‚Äôre like an Christmas angel. Thank you OP."
"Why should you feel lousy about yourself? You did nothing wrong. A crazy person shouted at you for no reason.  She obviously hates her own life because she's taking it out on strangers. 

Please don't internalize."
I really thought this would turn into her getting mad that she didn‚Äôt get a few cents off her purchase as well. I‚Äôve never been happier to be wrong!!
"I did a little. He was so happy to get her a ring but she was just shitting on him the whole time. She seemed abusive. Why he wants to marry her, I have no idea. They had no chemistry and she seemed repulsed to stand next to him. At first, I honestly thought that was her dad or something, just by how she was acting."
"Ah, you were so nice about it. I used to work at a mart that has walls, and as I was clocked out and trying to gtfo, a customer tried getting my attention. All I said is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off the clock,‚Äù and walked away. He looked stunned that I wasn‚Äôt going to help him with something that I wasn‚Äôt going to be paid for. "
"I've had people insist they know the law or know the store rules better than me.  I just look at them every time and say, ""ok, you show me where it says that, and I'll buy everything you have myself, right now.""  I've never had to pay out."
Poor chicks. I hate people who do these things. 
"I listen to a *lot* of true-crime podcasts, and it was weirdly chilling in the way people often use to describe interactions with serial killers. I fucking hope not, because he was a thirtysomething white guy and I couldn‚Äôt pick him out of a lineup of one. "
I don't know whether or not I feel bad for the guy :/
"Wow. Adult temper tantrums never cease to amaze me. They throw a full blown tantrum the same way a five year old might.

Wait. Scratch that. The five year old probably wouldn't cuss you out."
"I'm convinced many customers think all retail stores are part of the same group, that we all share money/inventory."
"I would‚Äôve done everything I could to make her pay for that, that‚Äôs the only way these dumbasses learn "
"So many questions...the main one being, why (and how) on earth does some who is being fired for screw-ups get a two week notice? I've never in my life heard of any employer telling someone, ""Sorry, we are going to let you go but you get to work here for another two weeks"" except in the case of a position being eliminated, which it doesn't appear is the case here. Andy was a dolt by what you've posted here, yet he was allowed to continue working and potentially costing the company more money? I get that a lot of places are desperate for help but this is very weird to me."
"Yeah, I'm not reaching into anyone's pants for a tag (nor a shirt for that matter). If they couldn't dig it out themselves I'd have someone bring up a duplicate I could scan from the shelf. Assuming no sensor of course, then you are forced to make them take them off like you did."
"&gt;About 40 minutes later, the original customer called back and tore me a new one for making her look like a liar to her friends.

He didn't make you look like a liar. See, when *you* told your friends they offered a service (home delivery regardless of address) they didn't offer, *that* made you look like a liar.

&gt;He laughed and told me that people will always try to take advantage of a kind gesture, and that he was glad that she wouldn‚Äôt come back again.

Yep, people have a knack for extrapolating special circumstances into a general rule. I had someone come to the service desk who managed to convince a manager to let her return over a hundred dollars worth of baby clothing without a receipt. The manager explained they'd make an exception and she'd have to have a receipt in the future. She strolls back in a couple days later to try with another load of clothes, she got a firm no this time. She stormed off screaming about how it doesn't make sense because they let her do it a few days ago."
"üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª Like ‚Äî yes, great job on couponing, lady but HOLY HELL! Show some respect to the people who are ringing you up! They‚Äôre human beings, not NPC‚Äôs in your biography!!"
"Plot twist: She had an ""accident"" on purpose. She hasn't felt the touch of a human hand down the back of her pants for years."
"once we had a mom ask to check out her small basket of groceries in electronics to skip the line up front, it was usually some old guy asking this but she was like 30 with her son in a stroller. she had like 30$ worth of groceries and her card got declined. she asked to take some stuff off and it got down to like 12$ and she was ready to pay, and at that point it was just food for the kid she left on. felt so awful, me and a coworker scanned all her items again and just split the total between the two of us. she gave us both a hug that was so tight you could tell she really needed a hug and then left"
"Ya I'm gonna post about Andy again in the future, but bottom line: we're pretty soft-hearted around here. I mean Christmas is coming man, and as much as I hate working with the guy, I don't hate *him* or anything. So we figured we could cover for him a little while he looked for something else. 

And ya, we're a bit desperate for staff coverage. Maybe we could have managed but it would have been a pain. 

The biggest irony is that, outside of his stupid handling of Spectaculoid, he was a lot better than usual over his last 2 weeks. Still slow as molasses of course, but at least not half as lazy as he used to be and with a good 70% fewer mess ups.

We paid the price for it, but it was the right thing to do for your fellow man. Stuff like this is how you build the world you want to live in. "
"&gt; ‚ÄúI CAME ALL THE WAY FROM nearby town only 2 miles away FOR THIS‚Äù

You could have traveled from the Moon, it doesn't magically make us have one available for sale. If you positively can't waste a trip then call ahead and have it set aside. Even if the inventory system and website took into account the display model (and was accurate) it could have been in someone's basket when you checked the website or been sold in the time it took you to get here. If the store has a policy of not putting things on hold then you make the trip at your own risk.

Now if you called, were told it was set aside for you, and then it wasn't there when you got there when you arrived in the time frame you said you would (and the store agreed they could hold it that long), then sure, be upset at the store. Otherwise, things sell out, that's life."
"I work at the same store, and thank god you didn‚Äôt give it to her because we‚Äôre reusing it again next spring üòÇ I always have people asking to buy our stem buckets...which are rusty and dented all to hell. Like even if I could sell you this, why would you want it???"
"I have no respect for people that park like a jackass, and even less for people that use handicap spots without proper documentation.  (All you need is a placard, come on.). Good on him for teaching them a lesson.  "
"My impression is that he just needed a place to keep his stuff and he thought that if he jammed the truck in there, and sabotaged it, then the rental company would just abandon it and he'd have a free storage locker.

It almost makes sense except for being utterly insane. "
Your boss is a lot more forgiving than I am. That lady would have been forking over the $80 for the ruined jeans. 
"""Look at me. I am the customer now."""
What a terrible excuse for a human being.
"Yep, so true. I learnt that the hard way. "
Once it gets outside of the store it‚Äôs not our problem 
I had a guy insist that a) service dogs were only given to blind people and that b) service dogs aren't allowed in food areas. He was wrong on both counts
"That made me shudder

I've had a customer go to tug on my septum piercing before, in the same way that someone might reach out to admire a brooch. I was so taken aback, like, who even pokes a stranger in the face, let alone fiddles with their body jewellery? possibly causing damage?

Then again they quickly were taken aback themselves and apologised, sometimes people forget that body mods are part of real people, which just combines wonderfully with the customers who forget the staff are real people

We're just prettily decorated machines to them"
This is quite possible. 
"Do you guys think he got the truck stuck on the first day and just avoided the whole thing for four days, or what?"
"It can be really tempting to simply reflect the emotions that are thrown at us by every guest.  I learned a long time ago that I have to be who I want to be, not who grumpy guests try to turn me into.   

She's going to be on my mind this Christmas.  I really hope she gets the help that she needs.  "
"&gt;Needless to say, cops were called and she was escorted out, screaming how we led her to kill them, it‚Äôs our fault, we hurt her, etc. Turns out she was a past employee (before I was there) that the company fired because she was caught stealing money and lying. 

There is just something so pathetic and tragic about the plaintive cry of, ""You made me do it!"" 

&amp;#x200B;"
"It kinda amazes me that there are people still unsure about how email works. I understand being techno-illerate, especially with the older crowds, but email has been a thing for like twenty years."
"As soon as money was exchanged for the milk, it became HER gallon of milk that broke inside HER car.  Maybe next time she'll secure her groceries so they don't tip over and spill. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"&gt;I spoke to the store owner who was out of state at the time. He laughed and told me that people will always try to take advantage of a kind gesture, and that he was glad that she wouldn‚Äôt come back again.

This is by far the most heartwarming part of the story."
"Has she bothered to tell her ""followers"" how extraordinarily large a pain in the A$$ she is at checkouts everywhere? "
"I worked at a coffee shop and my boss had recently started charging for cups of water, which was pretty ridiculous and many people complained. I was alone in the store during a very hot day, and this mom and daughter come in. They were running around town exercising but didn't have water bottles or money to buy the water. I told them it was not a problem and gave them the water anyway. After they left, I paid for the water out of my tips, nbd. 

The next day the mom came in and talked to my boss, and told my boss how much she appreciated my kindness. My boss figured I was giving water away and didn't like the loss of profit, which was a total of a dollar. When I came in the next day she was there waiting to yell at me. I sat and listened while she scolded me for 15 minutes. After she was finished I told her I paid for the waters out of my tips and she can check the receipts. 

After all this she continued to scold me, and would continue to act this way towards me till I quit because of it. "
Nice to see a mother believe the worker over her precious little sprog
"I mean, unassuming 30-something white guy is pretty much the standarddemographic of serial killers isn't it? Inb4 'not all white guys'."
"Come on, she could have milked it for all it was worth..."
"My go-to is ""I don't work here."", wearing my badge, usually fully dressed in our product. Their reactions are fun. "
"It was one of those ‚Äúdamned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt‚Äù situations.

Do nothing to appease the angry customer? Well, good luck getting him to come back ever again.

Chastise the vet? Not only do you lose a regular customer, you might run afoul of the local news, your reputation in the local community is ruined...

The manager did the best thing he could have, I think."
