"Cartman: You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!

Stan: What'cha do to Butters this time?

Cartman: It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 

Kyle: Dude!

Cartman: I know I know, check it out, I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!

Stan: Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?

Cartman: Because that makes Butters gay now!

Kyle: No dude, that makes you gay!

Cartman: Eh- ...what?

Kyle: You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!

Cartman: Nuh uh.

Kyle: Yeah huh!

Cartman: Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?

Kenny: That makes you very fucking gay.)

Cartman: But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!

Stan: You are now."
Samuel L. Jackson. He's been in countless movies. I was going to say Stan Lee but you know...
"Not haunting and not a medical staff. Stan Laurels last words were ""I  wouldn't mind going skiing right now"". The nurse then asked ""Oh I wasn't aware you were a skier"". Laurel replied by saying ""I'm not. I just rather be doing that than be here with all these needles stuck in me""

He passed a few moments later. He stayed funny till the last moment."
