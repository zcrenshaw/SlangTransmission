"One time. It wasn't so much as how she looked, but the odor that came from her once she was completely naked. I couldn't do it and had to trash my bad sheets."
"Like... once, to my best friend of many years, before we went off to college. Mostly my friends and I just... you know... do something, then someone mumbles something like ""I’m feeling kinda down since Linda left,"" then someone else gives him a pat on the back and mumbles something about knowing it can be rough, then we all mumble ""yup"" and go about what we were doing. "
"My ex GF had a tail. It was about an inch or so. Just a bone really. It freaked me out at first because she'd never mentioned it. She had swung her ass up on my face for a 69 scenario and I felt like a finger jab my forehead.

   Edit: Big thanks for the bling! 

Twice over! Too kind."
"Was dating this girl who’s ear smelled sour and quite rank. It might have been her piercings. It ultimately led to me not being turned on around her. We’d be be having sex and I’d get a whiff of her ear and then I’d keep thinking “stinky ear”. It’s really hard to keep a boner when everytime you start to have sex the term “stinky ear” keeps assaulting your brain

whose*"
Anyone else have very little idea of what their classmates are up to these days?
"I went to high school with Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, so........."
"I'm from a small farming town about an hour outside a major city.  He was the stereotypical chiselled-jaw homecoming king, quarterback of the football team, valedictorian, long-term dating the captain of the cheer squad.  They got married straight out of high school, popped out a couple of kids, and he started at his dad's mattress store.  Still there as far as I know.  

I actually expected a lot more, because he defied the cliche of being a dick to everyone outside of the popular clique.  He was always showing up at punk rock shows and band concerts for his girlfriend and was super nice to everyone, and it didn't come off as fake.  Pretty much everyone liked him.  Seems like he could have done just about anything he wanted.  If he's happy with his life, though, who am I to judge?"
At least they were your bad ones. 
Not often enough
"One time. 

I dated a girl who was very busty, fit and pretty in the face. I consider myself lucky that I even got her. We were at her house and we started to make out for a good hour. During our make out, I started to smell bug spray mixed with body odor. I didn’t know where it was coming from, but we continued. 

She took her top off to reveal that she wore 2 bras because of her size of boobs. So she popped both bras off and revealed her huge tits to me. I’m a titty sucker, so I went in for the kill. But, I found where the smell was coming from and it was worse.

I pretended that I just wanted to kiss her lips. She laid on top of me and shoved her boob in my mouth. I almost vomited from the taste and smell. She sixty-nined herself on me, removed her pants and underwear. She removed my pants and underwear and started to suck my flaccid penis. As she was sucking, her vagina was Extremely wet. So wet that a glob of grool fell onto my eye. I felt it burn and stuck to my contact. My vision became blurry. I tried my best to get a boner, but I couldn’t muster one. She kept sucking and licking but nothing worked. She finally got the memo and I left. We dated for a total of 3 weeks and we tried other times, but I was just turned off. I know other guys like that stuff because she is engaged now and her man absolutely loves her. But when we cross paths at parties, she still smells like bug spray and body odor.

Edit: THANK YOU FOR THE SILVER KIND STRANGER! :)

Edit 2: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD KIND STRANGER! :)

Edit 3: PLATINUM!! THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!! :)"
One time I walked in on my nan changing. 
"It probably means that you're very attractive but don't project openness. For example, you don't make eye contact with guys and smile, you just wear a resting scowl and avoid making eye contact with guys. This makes you look like any guy who approaches you will be shot down aggressively. So they don't take the chance."
"The things my husband does that make me feel special are:

- Coming up behind me while I’m at my vanity in the morning and rub my shoulders for a minute
- Slaps my ass for no reason other than he likes the sound
- Wraps his hands around my waist from behind and tells me he loves me
- Brushes my hair while we watch TV
- Changes my oil for me
- Turns on the heating blanket while I get ready for bed so it’s nice and warm when I get into bed
- Sometimes makes me my morning protein shake while I’m getting ready for work
- Does little things around the house such as unload/load the dishwasher, feed the kitties, vacuum, sweep, offer to fold laundry, etc

But most of all, he knows how to make me laugh when I’m having a lousy day. "
After reading through all of these I am so fucking glad I am married. You guys are giving me nightmares.
Bold of you to assume I've seen a woman naked
"It's comfortable. Clothes just get twisted and I don't care for midnight wedgies. 32 now, don't remember ever sleeping in clothes unless it was on someone elses couch in my teenage years. "
"Just having her there is comforting. I stayed home alone for the first time in awhile a few weeks back and it was a little weird. Even if we're not in the same room or we are and are just doing our own thing, it's nice to know she's there and I can talk to her or do something together whenever we want to."
This is so fucking accurate holy shit
"The only thing that has completely taken me out of the mood was a very foul smell from her vagina. I told her I had been to the gym earlier and wanted to shower first and asked her to join me. Worked without saying ""Damn girl, that pussy stank!"" "
"Never significantly, and honestly I can't say I've been that surprised by clothing tricks... well maybe padded bras, but I like smaller breasts so I wouldn't have been disappointed anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Smell, on the other hand, has taken me by surprise a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: To be clear I don't expect or even want a woman to have no smell, I've just been with a couple who didn't have the best hygiene, had a physical issue, or just didn't have a scent that I found attractive.

 "
"I never used to until recently. I was in a situation in a relationship where I need help from them, so I had to be. As soon as I became open with them, they became open with me. It's actually resulted in the friendships growing beyond where I ever thought they would"
Splitting rent. Lol
"My last ex.

She was a BIG girl, which is cool for me because I personally like a little chub, but you have to take care of yourself.  As in wipe properly and wash your vagina regularly.  When you don't do those things you smell, and a bad smell can really ruin the mood.  One of the first time we had sex she didn't tell me she on her period and I got a handful of blood all over my hand and dick.  The imagery and strong smell of iron made me wonder if I should put my wiener in there.

I did.

Well shit on a god damned dick, this certainly blew up.  Thank you everyone for the stories and encouragement!

To whomever gave me silver, thank you!"
I suddenly feel a strong need to take a long shower after reading through the comments
Shot execution style and left in the woods. He wasn’t found for several weeks.  I guess it was part of a drug deal gone bad. 
"I would always let my friends borrow money but when I was in need they weren't ever able to help. One friend even said "" I dont do that, you do that"" after I asked him if he could pay for dinner and I'd pay him back because I forgot my debit card. "
"It's that or ""She was a fucking bitch"""
"I feel like an asshole saying this, but I have been bummed out before. I just am not into bigger women and sometimes clothing can be deceiving. Ill get downvoted probably like I am supposed to be able to control what I am attracted to, but it is what it is. "
Their face is the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you see before going to bed. 
"When I was living in the barracks I started dating a girl that lived down the hall from me. She was this gorgeous blonde that I met at the gym on base.  A fellow acquaintance introduced us and we started dating.  Everything was great but I started noticing that when we went to the gym almost every day, after our workout she never went to take a shower.  It got to the point where when we'd get done I'd say something along the lines of ""Well that was a lot of cardio, I'm gonna go shower now... If you need to go shower thats cool, I can wait for you.."" But that shower never came.

Fast forward a week and she's really wanting to have sex with me.  She pulls my pants down and starts giving me an awesome blow job.  I instantly start taking her pants off and as soon as I got her pants and underwear off, I smelled this horrendous odor that I can only describe as a dead rotting body that had been sitting out in 110 degree heat for a week.  It was fucking horrible.  In about half a second I went from rock hard to completely flaccid.  She kept pulling on me to penetrate her but I wasnt able to.  The stench was so bad that I said out loud ""holy fuck, thats horrible!"" 

She instantly start balling her eyes out and rolled away from me on my bed.  As she was crying I just sat there feeling horrible that I had said that but it really was a horrendous smell.  I said to her ""I'm really sorry but that smell is horrible...""  I sat there for about 15 mins and she ended up getting up, putting her clothes back on and going back to her room.  I got an email from her the next day telling me how ashamed and unattractive she felt from it all...  We didn't last long after that."
"Hah, I have seen my birth video. Later virgins"
Turns out she had a penis. 
Probably. He looked 35 among the other 17 year olds.
"He’s Aquaman now and deserves every bit of fame and good fortune that comes his way. He taught me how to skateboard, invited me to parties, and stuck up for me when upper classmen tried to bully me or give me shit. He’s truly a kind and sweet individual."
"Zero. I’ve only seen a few naked, though. Usually if I get to the point where I see them naked I’m already into them. Weirdos on the street never show me the goods."
"I can only think of once, but that was a hygiene issue. Girl clearly wiped her ass from back to front. I was so put off by the smell of ass when I got ready to go down on her I just got up silently and hit the road. I’d see her occasionally out and about. Adorable. Hot. Tremendous personality. She’s still completely dtf me. That shit smell always comes right back to me though. Nope. "
"I've been surprised before (my now wife lost some 80 lbs shortly before I met her, and things definitely did not stay in the same place after her clothes came off), but never actually turned off by anything. Once I'm actively turned on, it would take a lot to turn me off..."
It's probably an awesome matress store.
"He’s dead. A drunk guy parked his car on the highway and turned all the lights off and he hit him, died on impact. It was on the way home from a school sporting event late at night. It was very sad. He was everyone’s best friend, truly the nicest guy. "
Wtf
"There was a great tip here a few weeks ago. 

Pick 2 chores and make them yours. Make sure she never has to notice or ask them to be done. Don't make a big deal about them.

She may not notice right away, but will definitely appreciate it.

Edit: Feeling a lot of hate for encouraging men to do chores as a way to make their wives feel appreciated... Your criticism is misplaced. Sorry I'm in a happy relationship? 

Basically in a long term relationship you need to rely on each other to always do X.

Make sure X is a positive thing."
Everytime I tried it I ended up masturbating. 
Clean the snow off her car every morning.  Impromptu dates.  Movie nights where you don't touch your phone.  Ask her questions without providing solutions when she answers.  Listen.  Heat up a bath for her with some epsom salts or a bath bomb.  Bring her lunch at work or bring home dinner and watch a show on the couch with her.  Leave a note on her car in the morning.
"Interesting that there are so many nevers here. I have males friends that are like brothers and I open up to them about things that bother me all the time be it political, world views, personal. But of course these have to be good friends that I know and have proven I can trust with the information. "
It happened to my gf we had only been dating a few weeks. It was hard but I told her that I thought she had an infection and need to see a dr. She cried for like a dah. She was so embarrassed and scared I’d tell all of our mutual friends.  I told her “your my gf I wouldn’t do that to you ever and told her being in a relationship means we are able to talk about anything” it cleared up stayed together for a year and then broke up. She lied and stole all ofnour friends i introducednher to. Still never told anyone. But guess what Stacey that was  the rankest puss in the world. I heard the dr charged you double plus a cleaning fee.   You beautiful smelly mean person 
"Cuddles on demand, spending a whole day with her and not constantly thinking about having to go home by myself."
"One of the “big men on campus” from my high school was found in a house he had broken into where he killed the family cat. Before breaking into this house, the same day, he held up a school bus and threatened two children at knifepoint and stole one of their backpacks. 

He was a complete asshole in high school to everyone not in his friend group. This event happened about five years after high school and his buddies from high school had the nerve to set up a go fund me account for him so he could pay legal fees. 

Edit: looked up the local newspaper article. Douchebag didn’t technically rob children, they were high school kids. "
"If it makes you feel any better, imagining thinking “stinky ear” over and over made me chuckle."
Yeah imagine if he had been using his good sheets.
Started when I moved out. I think the obvious reason is comfort. Don’t have to deal with boxers riding up my ass or getting twisted for lack of better word.... 
"Yep, 100% agree. A woman can be a knockout but if she makes no eye contact with anybody, has a constant scowl on her face, and has closed in body language, no guy will approach her because everything is saying ""I'm not interested and am going to get pissed at you if you try to talk to me""."
"*sniffles*, weakly calls out ""Kobe"" and swishes yet another with a tear-soaked basketball."
"""You beat cancer and went back to work at the carpet store?"""
"I’m loving this thread. Appreciate that some appearances may be a turn off but overall, reading how the majority of you were just happy to get laid and weren’t up for finding imperfections in your partner has kind of given me a bit of confidence, so thank you."
“my dick must have wanted to see an ID” 😂😂
Does your husband have a brother?
"It's comfy. I started sleeping naked in my teens and just hit thirty.

Though it's too cold to sleep naked at the moment so for the next few months it's pajama time."
"&gt;	balling her eyes out

Now I’ve got the image of some heart-broken vaginitis girl draining 3s on the court"
"Not super exciting, I wasn't a hero or cause a confrontation. Basically what happened is I had just finished having sex with my partner at the time so I was naked with a half chub. I walked out of the bedroom to dispose of the condom, when I got to the loungeroom I noticed that the glass sliding door was wide open. I just figured we had left it open so I close it, I also notice my phone isn't in its usual resting place next to the door. Weird, I thought. Must've set it down somewhere else. 


So I continue on and throw the condom out, I turned around and noticed the cat was staring at something. Curious, I turned on the light just to see that the cat is staring at someone behind the couch. Their eyes just visible above the cushion, I see them look in horror at my face then their eyes snap down and right at my cummy half chub peen. I stood in silence and they stood up and they were holding a knife, I just calmly walked out of the room and returned a moment later with a hockey stick after telling my partner to call the police. By then they were gone but the thing is when describing the person to my partner I was informed that it was her ex boyfriend who was still infatuated with her. Ended up getting charged as he was caught with my phone and credit card. 


So not only did he get prison he also got to listen to me have sex with his ex, and see my deflating penis. Not a happy ending because now I get a tonne of anxiety about noises in the night and if he decided to attack I could've been seriously hurt. Oh, and now I sleep clothed.  "
"Never. 

I've had moments where *it wasn't what I was expecting* but none have turned ""me off"". This ranges from clothing tricks to more unexpected things like self harm scars. "
"Never. Not about real things at least. The most I do is bitch about work or something, but that’s usually more of a conversation starter."
Is it true that people thought he was a narc? 
Curling up with someone every night is really amazing. My girlfriend was out of town visiting her family a few weeks ago and I found it so hard to sleep alone at night.
"Over 400 lbs. Was all state in football and baseball, but destroyed his knee in college and can barely walk. 

He’s doing ok for himself though. He’s a CPA and became a dad last year. His wife is also awesome and hot as fuck. 

He started making an effort to get healthier last month and has been going to the gym with me a few times a week. Guy can still bench two plates no problem despite having not been in a gym for about 10 years. He really wants to be able to teach his son how to play sports and support him."
"Once. 

Girl was very pretty and had a nice personality. First time i slept with her I was pretty much black-out drunk. I remember at one point she was naked (in the dark) and trying to get on top of me. I was struck by how petite and flat chested she was (not really an issue normally), but she reminded me of a little kid. 

I gently pushed her off of me and said was too drunk. 

Second time, I was drunk again and just knew she was an option. This time the lights were on and I hit the same creepy roadblock. We did a bunch of other shit, but my dick must have wanted to see an ID or something as he wouldn’t come out to play. 

She was a nice, of legal age, girl with a good personality. But, she just reminded me too much of a kid and that put the brakes on. Some people would get off on that shit, but not me. "
"Mine is the reverse. Not big man on campus, but instead, big dork on campus. He was a fantastic artist in school and now he is a millionaire drawing for Marvel comics."
"That sucks.  Those push-up bras are disappointing, aren’t they?"
"Lil bit o’ grool in the eye would probably do it

Edit: first ever silver! I’m honored"
"The amount of comments in here about smell worry me. Lol! 

Edit: Some tips on hygiene from Del the Funky Homosapien.

https://youtu.be/2uceKqK7xYs"
"This girl I dated was on the swim team and she equated the chlorine in the pool for a shower.  Chlorine from the pool is the not the same as a shower. Not even close. 

"
I’m sorry but I can’t stop laughing at “I felt like a finger jab my forehead”
"He was an enormous shot put guy, kind giant though.  Used to eat like 40 bucks in taco Bell in one sitting.  Now he does a cooking YouTube channel a d lost like 200 pounds probably.  Culinary Brodown for those that are interested, he has a cool cookbook too"
"""Welp... 'bout time to hit the ol' dusty trail."""
*agreeable mumbling*
"Pretty much never. She's way shorter than me so it doesn't really work that way around.  
Plus I like her butt a lot so being the big spoon is better anyway."
"Did you actually confirm it was bug spray? Because my first thought was maybe it was fake tan, it also has quite a strong (arguably unpleasant) smell and I could see how someone unfamiliar with it could confuse the two. Unless you live somewhere where bug spray even on unexposed breasts is necessary..."
Prision...he got hooked on drugs and beat an 87yr old lady for her purse... Lady died in the hospital a week later
"My boyfriend has claimed the role of little spoon since we started dating two years ago. He may act tough on the outside, but he's such a baby when it comes to being cuddled. 

I love it. "
"Always. I'm a furnace so she hugs me to get warm and then rolls over before we get too sweaty.

Truth be told I love when her boobs press against my back. "
"I'm 19 and I'm a really warm sleeper. I cant sleep with anything because I roast. Sleeping naked keeps me cool.

Edit: 😭😁 I've never gotten a comment above 100 upvotes. Merry Christmas!"
"Waking up next to her every single day, rather than only a couple of times a week before we lived together."
"A friend of a friend said ""all men cheat and you're a fool if you think otherwise"". Yeah,nope."
"Once every few months, when the wife forgets how poorly we fit that way the last time. "
Yup
"I have been turned off by a few, but my penis never has."
"Chinese guy here.  It's fine when I make the effort.  I prefer dating Asian girls and have dated outside my ethnic group here and there, but not anything long term.  I'm fairly tall, so I also have that going for me.

My main issue is that my socio-economic status makes me less desirable in my area.  I do fine for myself, financially, but most of the Asian guys in my peer group make high five figures to six figures.  Status seems to be a fairly large issue to Asian girls, though my dating sample size might not be representative.

I try to make up for it by developing an interesting personality and collecting interesting hobbies and skills to make my dates interesting and fresh.  Currently not dating or making any effort to as I find dating to be tiring and need time to recharge.

Edit: to clarify, I'm Chinese American.

Hobbies:

1. Archery

2. Blacksmithing

3. Carpentry

4. Backpacking/Camping

5. Hunting?"
"There was a guy I went to school with that basically kicked the shit out of everyone, all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 years ago I was in the gym, and he's there. He keeps staring over at me as I'm working out. He's a pretty shredded dude and has those kind of ""I will fucking kill you eyes"". Afterwards I'm in the changing rooms and he gets out the shower and walks up to me (towel on, before anyone says anything...). He starts telling me about how he'd been abused when he was a kid, and he basically took it out on anyone that got in his way for about a decade. He said he'd had a kid and he was in prison when the kid was born, and it really woke him up to the shit that he was pulling.

&amp;#x200B;

He goes on to tell me that he's really sorry if he ever caused me any grief or pain at school (it so happens he hadn't but I was one of the few that he'd left alone). He's going around his life basically trying to make up for the pain he caused and he's determined to try and be a good person. We had a long chat about my life (I was getting ready to move to another country for a job).   


Anyway I was back home a few weeks ago and bumped into him again, still a super friendly, very motivating and uplifting person who remembered every detail of the chat we had and was asking all about my new job and life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was pleasantly surprised and it really made me reconsider how I remember and frame people in my day to day life. "
"Surprised, sometimes, turned off? Never. Human bodies are weird mate, sometimes some pieces don't fit perfectly, or their history is shown on us, stretch marks, cutting scars, etc. At that point the person you're with is being vulnerable with you, and at that stage such small details are nothing compared to what you're sharing ya feel. 

"
"Im assuming you’re the type of girl thats attractive, but because of your body language and facial expressions most guys are terrified of you. The type I’m thinking is also terrible at flirting and never lets her guard down because shes too shy or afraid to show any intent.

My ex was like this. I got a date with her because I saw her leaning on a wall at a college party with no one to talk to and no drink. I felt bad and brought her a drink, which started a conversation about exactly your topic. "
"My favourite part of the day is in the morning when I'm half awake. I roll over to face my boyfriend, see that he's half awake too, get a sleepy grin from him, sleepy kiss and a quiet ""Love you"" then we cuddle and go back to sleep. 

And I get that every day

&amp;#x200B;"
"Was camping with a bunch of friends a few years back. We had been out there for 2 days. Swam in a couple random lakes around the property. So needless to say, collectively, none of us were all that clean. Regardless, one of the girls in our group which I had known for a few years randomly came on to me while we were out swimming. Later that night she asked to go for a walk. I knew what this meant...

Things started heating up and next I know we are both naked laying just off the trail. Now, I knew i smelled something weird/fishy but then again we were right next to the water. Didn't think anything of it. Started fingering her, got a huge foul wiff when I finally stopped. Knew exactly where that smell was coming from.

Still hit it. Will always remember that extremely foul odor like it was yesterday. Going forward, I will end sex right away if it is actually that bad. Don't get me wrong, I understand the vagina is a self cleansing machine and at times PH can be off. I actually love the smell of vagina.

But this kind of smell, will haunt you...forever..."
"Once. I was making out with a woman. I reached under her shirt and felt? Another shirt? Something dry and leathery and rough? Nope, that was the skin of her stomach. She noticed my hesitation and explained that the dry skin was a complication of her chronic systemic candida. The dry skin covering her torso, combined with thinking about whole-body yeast infections, kind of killed the mood.

EDIT: Since people are being a bunch of numb brained chucklefucks who don't know how to google, yes, it is a real disease: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1076/systemic-candidiasis"
"That's a bingo. I've been surprised and even shocked once or twice, but never *ever* turned off. Even if there was a brief moment of pause to consider, my mind immediately went back to ""oh boy, a naked woman here who wants to have *sex with me*, woo!"" "
"It’s the reason we moved in together. A single room apartment split two ways is a hell of a lot cheaper than extra rooms for roommates. Because we split everything (chores, groceries, furniture, entertainment, etc) we enjoyed a much higher living standard than any of our peers.

Five years strong. Turns out, marriage is still about economics. (We love each other too!)

Maybe it takes the romance out, but I realized a long time ago that a partner could be just about anyone; it’s about finding someone your objectively a good team with and fighting and striving to always be a little bit better of a teammate tomorrow.

"
I do it every now and then but usually I do it with my gf so I can feel her body against mine.   
"My man
"
Did it wiggle when she got excited?
If she is shorter than you than she can be your jetpack!
I used to but then I had to face an armed intruder naked. Not ideal.
she took off her heels and she was shorter
"My friend has a daughter, and he can't keep a job to save his life.  He told me he quit his job at walmart because he stole too many video games and was afraid to get caught."
"My wife’s body type was unexpected, but once I experienced it, that was my thing from then on! "
Clitty litter i think it’s called 
"You're wrong, this story was very exciting
"
"Look at these bourgeois, having girlfriends and all /s"
"I'm sure women know this better than most guys do, but to any ladies reading these horror stories of odorous vaginas, **DON'T** douche.

&gt; Most doctors recommend that women do not douche. Douching can change the necessary balance of vaginal flora (bacteria that live in the vagina) and natural acidity in a healthy vagina. The acidic environment protects the vagina from infections or irritation.

&gt; Douching can cause an overgrowth of harmful bacteria. This can lead to a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. If you already have a vaginal infection, douching can push the bacteria causing the infection up into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. This can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, a serious health problem."
Reality is often disappointing 
"All the time. It's called Jetpacking.

Two reasons:  

1. As much as I love her hair, I can't sleep when it's right in my face, because I have to sneeze all the time.  
2. We always sleep naked and I get too aroused to sleep when her butt is on my dick, even when the last sex session was 10 minutes ago. When I was 20 I kinda hoped that this constant horniness would balance out eventually, but nope, 12 years later it's still the same.  
If she grabs my butt from behind I also get horny, but it's a little better that way.
"
"Some physical characteristics in the ones I have been with: breasts so big they go under her arms too, breasts that are just nipples, one super long labia, labia like a rose's petals, cellulite, stretch marks, legs like cylinders, huge biceps, a penis.

What I have thought every single time: ""I AM HAVING SEX! THIS IS FANTASTIC! THANK YOU SO MUCH!"" and then I just go down on them for hours.

I guess not everyone is beautiful. But I never saw someone naked and didn't feel just honoured to be there."
How do you delete someone else’s comment?
"Pick her up under the arms and present her to the world from the highest point in your general area. 

"
Nunchucks.  I stay away from women swinging nunchucks.
That last line was a roller coaster of emotions. I can’t imagine what your break up was like. 😂
"Pretty girls scare me.  A girl's personality doesn't intimidate me.  But some girls come off as cold and uninterested while the competition is putting out a warm and accepting vibe.  That could be your hurtle.  If you like a specific guy, act like it."
"I am old, so I had to look up PAWG on an Internet slang dictionary. I figure you probably meant ""Phat Ass White Girl"".

However, if you meant ""Pissed American With Gun"", I'm gunna need to hear more..."
I tattooed her face on them
"""...a penis"" 

Hol' up"
Because how else I am going to spoon my member between my partner's ass cheeks if I'm wearing something?
"Exactly. The only man who would approach her is foolhardy to the point of going beyond confident and into rash and stupid. 9 times out of 10, a woman projecting this vibe *does not want to be approached* and will be pissed if you do.

EDIT: Don't be pedantic about the numbers people. Sure it may not be 9 out of 10, but most people projecting ""fuck off"" are *very likely* to say ""fuck off."" Not rocket surgery,"
"Went on a trip with 3 buddies last summer. One guy has been known to have a short temper once in a while but we put up with it. 
Anyway, we were all tired and in the car for 3 hours and my one friend (who we went out to visit) was joking around about something. The guy with the short temper took it completely out of hand and he literally reached around the back of my friends seat and choked him out...everything changed since then. Definetly didn’t want to be around him anymore. "
"I think we met the same girl. I was in Germany at Oktoberfest and ended up taking her back to my friends tent (we were staying on a campsite). We were goofing around and one thing led to another and my hands were down her pants and hers down mine. 

One of my golden rules with any girl for the first time is after a play with her lady parts, you have a cheeky scratch of your nose (without her knowing if you're a professional) to subtly figure out what you're dealing with down there before you send in your super trooper.

Needless to say, the smell can only be described as pungent. Like I'd walked into a cheese factory that had also been flooded and all the cheese was damp and may have also been shat on.

I quickly tucked my old boy away and made up some excuse that my friend really needed me back up in the bar area. I felt really bad, and part of me looks back and thinks maybe I should of told her, but jesus christ I am glad I did not put my willy in there."
"Guess she wasn't very... *candid* about her condition...

^I'm ^sorry "
"&gt;If you need to go shower thats cool, I can wait for you..

Take note people, if you ever hear anyone say something along these lines to you, they are trying to politely tell you that you smell like wet garbage and have been for days."
"Always redirecting the conversation to make it about them, and trying to one up you at the same time. 

Me: “School has me so stressed, this professor is driving me up the wall.”

Them: “You’re stressed? My professor has us doing ___ and he’s so rude etc”

Me: “I’m tired, didn’t get much sleep last night”

Them: “You’re tired? Oh my god I haven’t slept in days.”

Me: “I had a lot of hair as a baby”

Them: “I had even more hair as a baby, here let me show you all my baby pictures.” "

"So after a break up I moved back to my home town and isolated myself in my new apartment, except to go to work.  

A girl messaged me online and we talked. She was cute enough. Great face and breasts. 

We hung out, Ate food, and cuddled. She knew I wasnt looking for anything serious having just come off a failed engagement. She also kbew I was looking to bang. She was too. 

So we began getting frisky and she was quick to take her shirt and bra off. But as we continued, she said she didnt want to remove her pants yet. She said she did wanna have sex, but she wanted to take off her pants herself. Fair enough.  So I waited for her to do so. 

Ive noticed that a lot of women who have an overabundance of one physical attribute can sometimes have none of another. 

Reddit, her ass wasnt flat. It was concave. It didnt stick out in the slightest if anything it sunk into her pelvis. Where a normal human ass would be was nothing but air. 

I wasnt expecting this. And I didnt know how to react. We didnt do anything. Which I'm fine with. She ended up wanting to cuddle and watch tv. I never called her again. She was super sweet so she probably found a boyfriend whose not bothered by it or something.  I hope she did. "
Reminds me of that one post on here a few months back about the chick and her bf that wouldnt wipe his ass because he thought it was gay or some shit. 
I actually prefer it but feel bad in asking for it.
"He's one of my best friends, actually. He's the CEO of a company that he and one of his childhood friends started, and they opened up an office in a second city this year. He also got engaged recently. Oh, and last year he won an award for one of his pet projects. "
"A girl at my HS was on ""My Super Sweet Sixteen"" turns out her mom paid for it by embezzling millions of dollars from the company she worked for. Mom is now in jail and even had an episode about her on a series (Discovery I think) about female criminals. Daughter is laying very low after the story blew up. "

"Damn that is rough.  As a woman, I can confirm that vaginal care is complicated and something that must be learned.  I would bet money that this blonde had BV (bacterial vaginosis).  It smells terrible, and is very common--so common that you can get it randomly for no reason.  However, you do need a prescription from your doctor to cure it."
I agree. I like to think I dont smell bad but what if I'm just nose blind? It's an anxiety of mine for sure.

"In California at least, East Asian (and especially Korean) culture is huge for younger people. And it’s even more popular among women than men. Kpop, boba tea, the clothes, etc. There’s tons of Asian men running around with cool hair and streetwear. I’m not Asian myself, but a good friend of mine is ethnically Chinese (his parents only speak mandarin but he’s lived in America his entire life) and he’s noticed a huge shift in his ability to date interracially in the last 5 years or so.

"Little things man. Help her around the house a little more, buy her flowers just because it's Wednesday, tell her how lucky you are to have her. "
"When my ex-gf was 12 she looked 18. One night her older brother threw a party, and since Momoa was a close friend he joined in the fun. Momoa spotted my ex sitting very uncomfortable between two 18-year-old guys who were getting very inappropriate with her. Momoa to the rescue! He shooed the two creeps away, sat down next to my ex, and ask her if she was ok. He then cheered her up by telling funny stories and said he's keep an eye on her so for the rest of the night, which made her feel huge relief. And apparently he was universally loved at school."
That's the back of your eyelids you're thinking of
Jason Momoa? He does seem like a genuinely good guy.
"Definitely when I invited a friend to come hang out with some of my other friends and party. The next morning he proudly showed me all of the drugs he stole there. 
Super dick move.

Edit:
I'm talking about a full bag of XTC, and a bottle of poppers. It was ordered the night before by the host. He stole someones cigarettes too. And they knew it was 'us'. There were two other people awake when we left. One of them was my cousin's girlfriend. "

"i used to be a swimmer, and after about a month of practices, your skin would start to retain the chlorine smell. After every practice i would sower right away, soap and everything, but the chlorine eventually starts to stay in your skin.  I could put and drop of water on my skin and you could smell the chlorine being drawn out of my skin. interestingly enough, my sweat also smelled like chlorine. hell of a lot better then actual sweat smell "
I have a female friend who was on the receiving end of this last year and I literally had no idea how to comfort her. There's nothing reassuring that can be said once your date stops sex because of a funky smell. 
I did not confirm it was bug spray. But we live in Kansas and this happened during Christmas back in 2013. I don’t know why she would have been wearing bug spray in the winter time
"I wouldn't say turned off exactly.

The only memorable experience was a girl who wore those Spanx.

She was not overweight but she was a heavier girl. Those things really reshape their entire body lol.

she went from a curvy girl to a PAWG. We also had a LOT of fun. whew."

"I have no idea what the big man from my school is doing. Mostly because my school had 5,000 kids.   I do know where a few classmates are as I talk to them. But only 3 old classmates. "
"I always slept in just underwear. Works have been nude my whole life but my mom didn't like to knock and I rarely had more than a sheet to cover. I have kids but I keep a pair of shorts next to me bed that I can throw on if I need to.

As for the whole what if someone breaks in, fat naked guy charging you is pretty effective. There was once I was starting to wake up while still dreaming so thought someone was in the house. Jumped out of bed and threw the door open into the living room. Probably had a pretty wild look in my eyes. "
"I, too, appreciate your honesty.  You’re not being rude or insulting; you’re answering the question.  Thank you for your tactful honesty.  "
"She told me I was a crappy friend and I was never there for her and I was selfish.

This is after I supported her with her bipolar, looked after her daughter (7) for a couple of days after said friend got so drunk and violent at my family barbecue she was arrested and spent the night in jail (she called me the next day from jail as she wasn't sure where her daughter was), after that I helped her stop drinking, helped her start a degree, she also gave birth in my car on the way to the hospital that I was driving her to because she had nobody else to take her... I have spent hundreds of ££ helping her with food shopping, furniture, clothes, driving her around...

In the end I just said ""either I'm a crappy selfish friend, or you don't appreciate anything I do, either way it's a bad situation and I don't think we should be friends anymore"". "
I always think that's so adorable

"Idk if I have some kind of clothing fetish but I'm almost always more aroused when they are wearing something cute and girly as opposed to completely naked.  
  
With that said, I once dated this girl that would always wear large hoodies. We started dating and once she got undressed for the first time her breasts were definitely bigger than I thought and I almost passed out from the sheer beauty.  
  
I also agree with most of the comments, smell seems to be the biggest surprise/concern. I was staying at this girls house, we started going at it, we changed positions to doggy and all of a sudden I just got this horrible shit smell like she didnt wipe. Tbh I just held my breath and pumped as fast as I could and prayed it would be over quickly. It's impossible she couldn't smell it too right?"

"Not OP but I know exactly what you’re talking about. What a crazy, sad time that was"

If you live in UK maybe that or American football. Generally keeping up with and doing some sports  must be a good idea

I think when people think of autism the gravitate towards an awkward albeano gaming kid with acne but I know this isn't true. Another thing I would say is try to be interested in whatever you want to be interested in, don't try to fit in too much but maybe if you talk to people about their interests you might find a mutual enjoyment in somthing.

"Girls prefer to ""create opportunities"" for the guy to make a move, rather than make a move herself. Hints are clues, not confirmation. Ask her out.

Observe her ""baseline behavior"" and look for *deviations*, e.g. she offers food to you and no one else.

* She says compliments like, ""Hey, I like your shirt."" If she keeps walking, no go. If she stays to chat? Stop, talk to her and get her phone number. Men assume the girl likes their clothes, not likes *them.* 

* She asks what kind of girls you like, who you have a crush on, your relationship status, etc.

* She asks what clothes you think look sexy, hairstyles, etc. Sends you photos of herself in outfits to get your opinion. Green flag: you tell her, and she dresses that way. Or she changes her hairstyle based on you. If she doesn't change fashion *but her friend does*, she was a wingwoman to gather info for her friend to date you. 

* When you say you like or recommend something, she acts on it.

* She fishes for compliments. Especially if she acted on your fashion preferences.

* ""Friendly Inquisition"" - her friend(s) ask, ""What do you think of [girl's name]?"" ""Is she your type?"" ""Would you go out with her?"" *She sent them as spies.* Variation: her friend calls and asks. *The girl is on the line too, listening to what you'll say.*

* She pretends to be into the same hobby as you. She really likes you if she tries to beat you at that thing.

* She makes excuses to hang out *alone*, e.g. homework, tutoring, gives you rides, walk her home, etc. She flirts with you and asking personal questions. Green flag if you're not even in the same classes or does not need help.

* She asks you to help her with easy stuff, or teach her. Makes simple mistakes so you pay her more attention and touch her. She's over-the-top grateful and doesn't want you to leave. 

* She's always ""around."" Hoping you'll talk to her. Variation: lingering. After asking you a question and you answer, she's still there.

* She's gotten off work and has no reason to stay. *You're* the reason she wants to stay. If she's at work but says when she gets off work--she wants to hang out with you after.

* She preemptively mentions being single. Or she's broken up with her boyfriend. Or she mentions your girlfriend/wife as a sneaky way to see if you're in a relationship. 

* She gives you her phone number without you even asking for it. Or she gets your number from someone else.

* She texts you cute/sexy pictures *and* invites you to hang out. Key thing: when you do invite her to hang out in person, she does, and she's eager to. If she constantly flakes, she just enjoys your attention and doesn't want more. If she acts like this with you while in a relationship, run away.

* She brings up a movie she wants to see, a bar or restaurant she wants to check out, a party that's happening, etc. Especially if she says, ""But I have no one to go with."" She wants you to ask her out. 

* She casually bring up events, and gauges your reaction. If you show interest, she pounces and says you should go together. [4 hours later that night] *""Wait, did she ask me out on a date?""*

* ""Self-invite"" date, e.g. you tell her about a cool bar you went to, and she says, ""You should take me there!""

* ""Reminder"" date, e.g. ""When are you gonna take me for a spin in your car?"" ""When are we going to watch that TV show at your place?""

* She asks if you have plans for the night or weekend. Ask her out for drinks.

* She shares songs, photos, quotes, videos, stories etc. with you related to love. It's a ""test"" to see if you think about her in those ways.

* Writes big long messages in your yearbook, her phone number and an invite to hang out.

* She says you look like another guy she was attracted to: celebrity, ex-boyfriend, etc.

* ""Third Party Endorsement."" She expresses what she wants as if it was other people's opinion. ""My friends think we would make a cute couple."" ""My Mom asked if you're my boyfriend yet 'cuz we hang out together so much."" 

* Gives compliments using other girls as a cover: ""Girls must hit on you all the time."" ""You can get any girl you want.""

* Touching, hugging (she breathes you in), sitting on your lap, holds your hand, puts your arm around her, rubs her foot against you, etc. Asks ""Have you been working out?"" and feeling your biceps or abs. Asks you for massages/backrubs. Play fighting. 

* Clumsiness or acting drunk as an excuse to lean on you, for you to hold her, and get your faces in kissing range.

* She complains about being cold. If you're outside, put your arms around her. If you're lying down watching TV together, cuddle closer. If she says her hands are cold, hold her hands.

* She shows off her body. Bends forward to show you her chest or butt, shows off her legs, answers the door wearing little clothing (or a towel). She's really trying if she tells you to look at her dress, legs, etc. ""Look how short my skirt is!""  Or she invites you to touch. ""I just used a new razor to shave my legs and they're so smooth. Come and feel!"" 

* She finds excuses to remove clothes. Too hot, has to take a shower, change clothes, etc. She doesn't change rooms or close the door or kick you out. 

* She asks you for help taking her clothes off. ""Can you unzip my dress?"" ""My bra is stuck.""

* She ""steals"" something from you--like a hat. You're supposed to chase her into a room and kiss. Or takes a small item from you and drops it down her top. 

* She ""borrows"" things (she doesn't need) to make up a reason to talk to you.

* She ""forgets"" things at your place so she has a reason to come back--and hook up.

* She ""falls asleep"" on your shoulder. 

* ""The Friend Fadeaway."" You go out on a group outing with her and friends. They gradually leave until you're alone with the girl, maybe even her house or room. Variation: you show up thinking it's a group outing or a party, but she's the only one there.

* If you get sick or hurt, she gets worried beyond a normal friend. She comes over with food and plays nurse.

* She asks you to hold her drink. Marks you as her territory to other girls.

* When she's ready to leave she asks to split a taxi with you back to her place. Not with the whole group of friends, just you. College: she asks you to walk her back to her dorm room. Bonus if she says her roommate(s) are gone.

* If she has a party at her place, at the end she shoos out all the other guests but she insists you sleep over.

* If she's dropping people off after a party, night out, event, etc. she drops off everyone first and you last, even passing by your home to do it. To get you alone.

* She ""misses"" the last train, bus, etc. so she can sleep over. Or says her phone died and asks to get a taxi with you. 

* She brings up sleeping arrangements. She doesn't want you to sleep on the couch (or floor), and *insists* you share a bed with her.

* She mentions how she's home alone tonight, roommate is away, her parents out of town, etc. She wants you to invite yourself over to fool around. Or for you to ask her to come over to your place.  Hot tip: text her ""coming over"" or ""come over"" and see how she reacts. 

* She asks to see your place or invites you to hers.

* If she comes over to your place, she confirms you're alone (no roommates or parents). Asks to see your bedroom.

* She had dreams of you.

* Thirst: ""I'm so horny!"" ""I haven't been laid in [time]"" ""I've never fucked in [location you're both in now]."" 

* She brags about her sexual skills (""I give great blowjobs""), her tattoo, nipple piercing. ""I've got a tattoo on my thigh."" Your response: ""Prove it"" or ""I don't believe you.""

* She says, ""Did you know people who [blank] is a sign of sexual frustration?"" Meanwhile, she's doing that very thing. Like twisting napkins or peeling labels off bottles.

* She implies ideal circumstances for sex. ""We're the only ones here."" ""No one can hear us with these walls."" ""This bed is really comfortable."" ""I'm not wearing panties."" ""I'm on birth control."" ""I've got condoms in that drawer.""  

* She kisses another girl in front of you--and wants you to watch. Or invites you into a room to fool around more. How threesomes start. 

* She asks *you* out. She's tired of hinting. Straight talk is the last resort.

* She says she used to have a crush on you. If she's single, she could be hinting she *still* has a crush and you should ask her out.  

Negative tactics.  Meant to attract guys, but actually repel guys.

* She tries to make you jealous.  She brags about guys asking her out, flirts with guys in front of you, etc.  She wants to let you know she's ""in demand"" so you'll want her.  The problem is girls are turned on by social proof in relationships, while most guys are turned off.  

* Complain about guys hitting on her. She might be trying to plant the idea you should hit on her. This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl will think he's a creep if he does.

* Says repeatedly how drunk, high or tired she is. A hint to take her home.

* She insults you.  house_robot explained this really well:  
&gt; 
&gt; When a girl says, ""Oh you're a player aren't you?"" it's similar to when they say shit like, ""Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?""
&gt; 
&gt; It's the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. She's letting you know you have desirable qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

Positive:

* Food (+1 if she cooked or baked it herself), gifts, handmade greeting cards, mixtapes, poems or stories she wrote, etc.

"My best friend is always RIGHT THERE! Someone to split bills with, play with, cuddle, kiss, vent to when I have a bad day and vice versa. The pros are endless and the only con is I usually get stuck with the dishes and laundry but I love him so much I don't even mind. "
"It was always sleeping with her. She would put her head on my shoulder and sprawl across the bed like a starfish but it always made even my 6'5"" self feel safe. She never really took up too much room because she was so small. She passed away in a car crash a couple years ago and I can't have anyone even touch me while sleeping. I haven't had anyone move in since. Cherish the people you love. Don't drink and drive."

"I know a woman kind of like the above. Very pretty, lower self-esteem, but kind of snotty, sarcastic, and a little bit of a bitter bitch from life’s bs. She can be a lovely person on her good days when she opens up, but she’s stressed, life gets to her and she’s a natural introvert.

In any case, she gives off pretty strong “don’t touch me” vibes, even when she doesn’t want to. The downfall is, the only guys she ends up with are guys willing to cross the “don’t touch me” barrier...which isn’t a great pool of men to be allowing into life. Needless to say, those same guys are the reason for the snotty bitchy defense mechanisms, which just fuels the “don’t touch me” vibe.

Edit: No, I don’t know you.

Edit 2: When I originally wrote this I was thinking “I’m pretty sure she’s not on Reddit, but I hope this isn’t too much personal information for her figure out who I am if she ever comes across this.”

Apparently I either won’t have to worry about it, or she has like fifty alt accounts and she’s trolling me lol."
"The worst one, and I’ve said it before... was a girl I dated in high school. She was a clean freak. Like for real... everything she did was done followed by hand sanitizer. But  she clearly didn’t know how to wipe. Sex was a chore... Doggy style was always my thing, but I would get going and notice shit caked in between her asscheeks. That was always a mood killer.... I would just try to discreetly wipe it with her shirt lmao. But yeah, shit on your dick will get you soft pretty quick lmao."

"Big sports super star..good looking..lots of friends.... had everything going for him. He moved to San Diego after high school and had a successful business. During this time, there was ongoing news of a serial rapist in town ..he would attack women coming home from shopping etc. and zip tie them while he raped them in their garage or wherever..I believe most of the attacks happened in the day while he was supposedly working...he also had a wife and kids. Turns out he ended up attacking the wrong woman who knew karate or something like that and he got caught and arrested. While in jail, dude ended up hanging  himself.

"What a piece of shit!

Speaking of, I just had a friend stay with me for a week at the start of the month, and I am currently unemployed, so my finances are extremely limited. I made sure to ask if there was anything she didn't eat and she replied with one thing (olives I think), and I was like, easy!

So I go ahead and buy groceries for breakfast (oats, milk, peanut butter, jam, bagels, sugar) and make sure I have black tea (she's English), and I even got her some cider because she doesn't drink red wine (which I prefer because it's cheap and delicious!). While she's here I got us tickets to the Canucks (about $90 CAD I paid), and also paid for ubereats for breakfast one morning because she didn't want what I had (she doesn't eat peanut butter, and didn't eat oats... only had 2 bagels the entire time). Anyway, I'm out about $140 at this point, and she said she'd pay me back... didn't see a cent. She has a full time job back in the UK and even commented (the fucking nerve) that ""Wow I've barely spent any money while here, I am going home with so much more money than I thought""... 

I fucking give up. I've always been the person to do anything for my friends, but she didn't pay for a single thing for me, didn't buy any groceries, didn't give me any money... I feel like a fool. But - I learnt my lesson. Don't give to others what you expect to get back.

edit: not $180, $140. That was most of my budget for the month, too. Whatever, oats and spaghetti and bread for my meals until January."

"I wake up next to this naked sexy creature in my bed every morning. We cuddle for ages before getting up, then I head to work, often covered in little bit marks and hickeys. When I come home she's dressed so sexy, and has a wonderful healthy dinner going. The first thing I see through the door is her, and it drives all other thoughts out of my head. She's mine, and I want to spend every moment with her. Living together is just happiness."
"Same here. Met a really nice girl who was attractive and fucked like a minx, but her pussy smell filled the room and it was terrible. I met her a second time, chalking it up to bad luck. No changes.

"Started when I was 17 in hostel, I still remember greeting my housemaster that night when I went for a midnight pee, thought nothing of it ,and the horror that hit me a few days later when I realised I was nude when I went for that pee

"My boyfriend is the same. A year ago he used to ‘hate’ cuddling. Now we have a routine where he spoons me and i fall asleep and then somewhere during the night he turns and I become the big spoon. 

Truth to be told I love this dynamic because pressing my chest and face against his back is so soothing. "
"I had a friend who had stretched her ear quite big, and when she took out the stretcher the whole room stunk of her ear. I think it's to do with the bacteria in the piercing. Dont know why stretching made it so bad 🤮"

God speed you filthy but nonetheless alluring party girls."
Knowing that you have someone who loves you next to you every morning and night. Seeing into her eyes is an amazing feeling for me
"Aw I kind of feel bad for her. My right hand got destroyed by pompholyx and the texture is just plain bad. Fiancé doesn’t like holding that hand and I can’t blame him. Must feel like holding a dried up lizard or something. 

Let’s just say I have other talents in the bedroom. Ta-da. "

"Holy shit dude. I had a girl who I had flirted with back and fourth on social media randomly hit me up for a no questions asked fuck session. Like come over bang and that's it. She was gorgeous on Instagram, gorgeous in the flirty pics she was sending me all day leading up to it. When she came over and the awkward stage of introductions ended and we got down to it she got naked and I just knew it wasn't going to happen. Her body was not what I had anticipated and built my excitement for. I tried everything to get it up and keep it up. Had to suggest she suck it and try all other kinds of shit. I was just not into her, especially with no emotional connection and barely knowing her. I blamed it on all the fireball I drank at the bar before she came. Most awkward embarrassing moment of my life. "
"I saw the labia comment and just sighed, because I can never find a guy who doesn't mind labia. To each their own for sure but one more roast beef comment directed at my most sacred of places and I'm off sex for good.

But I was happy reading the last part lol I bet the women in your life appreciate your willingness to accept their flaws. 

Before I get attacked I KNOW OPIONIONS ARE GOOD AND HEALTHY AND I LOVE OPINIONS OPINIONS ARE GREAT WE ALL HAVE THEM AND IT'S OKAY TO HATE LABIA I'M NOT HATING I SWEAR. Just my labia get sad sometimes."

"Not once actually. Seeing a woman’s body for the first time doesn’t exceed or fall short of expectations, it’s just different from what I thought. Think of it like asking for grape juice.

You weren’t expecting that, but you don’t mind and end up drinking the whole thing because you actually like it. "

I went to high school with Logan Paul. Couldn’t tell you where he is now. I stopped following after his PR nightmare. 
This one is important. Stay off your phone when you’re spending time together once in a while. This part broke my last relationship. Wanted to spend time with me and he was on his phone the whole time. Boils my blood.
"Waking up next to her in the morning... While I'm rubbing my eyes, just for just a moment, just a bit, nothing else in the world matters. Not bills. Not work. Not that sound coming from my car engine I should get checked out but keep forgetting to. 

Just... her. 

Kisses and cuddles are obviously awesome, but even just the presence of this girl makes me forget about all that is bad in the world.  I go into work and look forward to the next time I can be with her. We're very busy people, but find the time to shoot each other sweet texts a few times a day. Each text from her makes me happy, even if it's just about something trivial. We don't live together yet but spend just about every night together, waking up with her and falling asleep with her have been the best part of my day for over three years now. 

She helps put everything into perspective, and helps me worry about life less because we have each other on our teams. To be quite honest, everything involving her is the best part of my day. I am so so thankful."
Same here but it was me asking out my crush.

I’m an Avid offroader. Which means I spend 50% of my time breaking my truck and 50% of my time fixing it. So normally I have tools and parts in my truck. I try and help anyone I come across that has broken down, Once I stopped to help a woman with a flat tyre and she just told me she had a husband, like right off the bat. ‘I’m happy for you, can I fix your car now and get you off the hard shoulder of the dangerous motorway?’   The worst was a woman who locked the doors and accused me of praying on women.  Which made me sad because that seems to be the state of the world. 

On a brighter note, Me and a buddy stopped to help a Chinese couple who spoke no English and had a flat on their Mercedes-Benz rental car on a country road north of Jo’berg in South Africa right before the sun went down. When we got back in my buddy’s truck his girlfriend (Who’s a Jo’Berg native, I was on Holiday there) pointed out we may well have just saved their lives, Being that they are naïve foreign people broken down in an area with high crime and no way of being helped.

As for other things that bother me like...how someone’s been acting lately, I’m not afraid to tell any of them that they’re being dumb af or anything along those lines "

"Honestly just being cute is kind of intimidating to a lot of guys.

Body language, stature and personality all play a part. Your resting face makes a big impact too, especially if your arms are crossed or you don’t make a ton of eye contact. 

If you’re well known that can be an issue as well especially if it’s for good reasons.

"Giving another woman's perspective, but often feeling valued has different tiers.  Little things are great, but they're extras when you're already solid. In my experience, if one partner is feeling taken for granted, there needs to be a more fundamental shift. 

For me, the single biggest thing that makes me feel valued and respected is having a partner who tries to show up every day ready to *be* a partner. 

Don't ""help out with chores"", participate in them equally (without relying on her to tell you to do them). Don't rely on her to keep track of birthdays and gifts, keep track of that yourself (including her birthday). The key here is to actually participate equally on all levels, she's your partner not your manager. Don't ""do what you're told"", if you see something that needs doing, just do it (and dont expect a parade after).  

No, you don't have to do every single chore 50/50 (some people hate dishes and would rather do laundry). But if you are mowing the lawn for 2 hours once a week, that does not equal her making dinner for 40 minutes every night.  

This advice might not apply to you. But when I hear other woman saying they feel taken for granted, this is usually what they talk about. "

"It's really very simple, the universal signal for ""come say hi I won't bite"" is to hold a guy's gaze and smile at him. If he's in any way confident, he'll pluck up the courage to come over and initiate a conversation. Might not be the first time you do it, but let's say you see him in the library and think he's cute, it's very likely that if you do that once or twice he'll come over and ask you what you're studying. Or you could even approach him if he holds your gaze and smiles back. I know us guys think we have to make the first move and often in terms of physically moving yes that's true, but more often than not, the first step is the woman signalling a permission to approach like this. Guys who are good with women understand these cues and look out for them."

He also likes to say something to me that sounds really important until mid sentence when it descends into gibberish - but still said with the same stoney-faced importance, so that I have to pause and question whether what I heard was actual words.

Or leaning in for a smooch and giving me a raspberry on the face instead. "

"I second this, my husband and I are complete opposites in how we like to give and receive love. Once I realised how performative and taxing it is for him to physically and verbally display affection consistently I started realising how all his tiny gifts and sacrifices are his ""I love you""s. 

It's still hilarious and adorable to watch him burst into a room I'm in and shout ""BABY, HOW ARE YOU BABY! I LOVE YOU MY THIII, BEAUTIFUL THIII"" slap my butt four times and grab my arms making a grunting noise and kissing my head before immediately bursting back out (half the time straight up leaving the house) before I have time to react and try to hug/kiss him back. In those moments it's like he's rerouting all power to the warp core for maximum affection-giving for as long as he can handle it and then has to go and recharge. "
"I love this answer. Nothing I've read in the last year has made marriage sound so appealing and reasonable to me.

"Doing something she doesn’t like doing, like laundry or taking out the trash. Be prepared to do it a few times before she actually realizes you are just being sweet and it’s not a random thing lol. If you have kids, a night for just the two of you to do something alone. Doesn’t have to be night out and expensive dinner. Maybe pizza and a movie at home. 

And I’ve honestly heard that in certain countries where the home roles of the sexes are pretty strict, and the men who still help out their wives have more sex than the others lol. So positives on both sides!


I used to write random little notes to my SO. No letters, just a short something like “I love your smile” or “I’m proud of you and everything you do” and fold them up and hide them in their pockets, drawers, etc.

"My fiancé found an analysis on this between men and women. Men can’t and rarely do confide in each other about deep things. The one person they usually have in their lives to confide in is their significant other. Just one person (this is a generalization and not indicative of all males). While women have their close friends, potentially many close friends, and significant others. So this can be damaging if a male and female open up to each other. For her, she could see it as confiding in a male friend. For him, it could be him confiding in her and hoping for romantic interest. But if she doesn’t show some sort of romantic interest in him, it can be painful...because that’s all a lot of males know...is confiding in a romantic partner. He can come across as overly emotional, clingy, etc, because he may be putting on the hardened front and keeping everything inside. And she showed him he can let his guard down, but then it’s like a dam opening up and it’s too much to handle. 

I’m not advocating for this. I wish it were much more socially acceptable to open up to other make friends. It would make it easier for guys to have more female friends (without having a romantic interest in them).

What kind of hobbies and skills have you been picking up to grow into a more interesting personality? 
Wild! I remember that all happening. My friend said he was always willing to walk them to their cars on late nights and never made them lock up alone. Freaked her right out when the news came out as his victims were mostly young Asian women and my friend (at the time of working for him) was a petite 23 year old Asian girl. 
"I wanted to ask this question myself. I also wanted to mention that before I met my current boyfriend, I was using Tinder to go on dates. I’d swipe right on and match w almost everyone. Of the white guys who matched with and messaged me, it was clear they had an asian girl fetish. So I only ended up going out with East Asian men. And a majority of these easy asian men had huge HUGE egos and chips on their shoulders. 

I think it’s stereotypes and the media to blame for this. Asian men and black men are the least wanted (I studied data on this in college) whereas Asian and white women are the most wanted. And then there’s black women who are the most hypersexualized. It’s sad.

"I'm not an Asian man. I'm a black African woman. I know I probably shouldn't be answering this thread, but I just wanted to share something. It's interesting to read people's dating experiences. There was an Asian (Canadian) guy at my university I really wanted to ask out on a date. However, I've read so much about black women being unattractive and there are so many beautiful Asian and white women on our campus that I basically chickened out. You may not get to know the women who find you attractive because they'll just hide it!"

"My friend was living with me temporarily while getting back on his feet after a divorce. I could deal with him turning into a depressed, self-destructive alcoholic, but the “moment” was when I was rummaging through my kitchen junk drawer and almost got stabbed by an uncapped needle laying in there. Wasn’t mine, and he and I were the only ones with access to my house. He denied it and tried to blame it on me, even so far as to lecture me about how f*cked up it was that I was shooting myself up (nope). He was a manipulative psycho, I completely cut him out of my life. "
He was the big man on campus because everyone saw him as the bad boy. He is now doing life in prison for several felonies. I guess we were all right about him

"When it comes to flirting, you flirt/tease with someone's obvious characteristics. If you were tall, you would get teased about your height. If you were well educated, you would get teased about your intelligence.

It's just an easy route for most guys to take, and it (hopefully) takes the edge off the girl if it's something she's self conscious about."
"This is really sad. There's a revisionist history podcast episode about the toll football takes on mental health and cognition, I think it's called Burden of Proof.

Pushup bra and some really nice clothes got me gud once.
"I'm Korean. I wouldn't say it is necessarily bad, but it is very polarized compared to what I believe other races of men might experience. Instead of getting laughed at and ignored by all women because I am Asian, I have found that there are basically women that would never ever even think about wanting to be with a Korean man, and there are women that really only seek out Korean men. There's very little room for a middle ground as an Eastern Asian man, at the current moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say that it makes dating a bit draining at times and you feel a bit objectified, but I think that it could be (and definitely was about 5 years ago) worse for Asian men. I do believe that there is a bit of disconnect between Eastern and Southern Asians, and that Southerns are viewed much less favorably and unfairly in western cultures. "

"I'm half Chinese and my kids are quarter Chinese so my experience might be different. I've dated around and had girls of most races interested in me.

Funny enough my 3-4 Asian male friends in college (all kinds of Asians) all ended up dating or marrying white girls. There are just a lot of white people in America and unless you go out of your way to spend time primarily with an Asian crowd you're probably going to be surrounded by white people.

As a hapa I ended up favoring my white side and generally look of ambiguous ethnicity and people have guessed I'm Mexican, Iranian, Japanese, etc. Wonder how my kids will look as they grow older. "

"I was an uber-dork in high school. Math club, chess club, etc. Had one or two close friends and otherwise wasn't very social. But I did play baseball too and was pretty good. Starting SS/2B for 3 years. 

The most popular guy in school was this dude named Drew who lived a few doors down from me and our moms were best friends. But I hated him. If I'm being honest now, I was just jealous of him. He wasn't a bad guy. He was just taller, better looking, and had better social skills than me. He got laid a lot. 

Anyway, after high school I didn't see or hear from him again for many years. About a month ago I ran into him at an AA meeting and we reconnected. We now talk almost daily. Our lives took very different paths but we both ended up addicts in need of help. Recovering addicts stick together despite our pasts. Our lives depend on it. "

"Just once, was a chick on tinder who had only recently gained about 20kg. All her pictures on Facebook seemed fine. She was thicc in those pictures but not fat by any means. That would’ve been fine on it’s own, but she also asked me if I was into shaved or not. I said I don’t really care; this was my mistake. I thought what she meant by that was “I haven’t shaved for a couple weeks, all good?”. What she really meant was she hadn’t shaved in about 6 months. I’m Italian and that moot was hairier than something you’d find on the hairy section on pornhub. It was fucked, and it smelt like shit. Another thing that she obviously wouldn’t upload because it would look horrible; she had a horrible smile. This is a fine line between me being a cunt and her cat fishing me a bit. I wasn’t expecting her to be 90kg odd when I’m a skinny ass 70kg 6’3 bloke, but I REALLY wasn’t expecting her to look like she would bite my dick off whenever she smiled.

Mum didn’t raise a quitter though, and I was a 30 minute drive from home. I really, really didn’t want to, but what kind of heartless asshole gets a girl naked before he says sorry not interested and leaves? Not this guy! She went down on me so I sure as hell wasn’t gonna let her go without. I did my duty but went soft as fuck in those bushes. Closed my eyes, had a pull off 30 seconds, hard enough for action. To her credit, she got a good 30 minute fuck because I was NEVER going to cum looking at that terrifying smile. And she did not break eye contact, god it was horrible. I flipped her over, closed my eyes, pretended she was Jennifer Aniston. Came in about 5 minutes, broke focus a couple times but pulled through.

She kept trying to get me to go a second time, then tried to get me to stay the night. I got out and she messaged me every second day saying she wanted that dick again. Even offered a threesome with her waaaay fitter friend. But I had learnt my lesson. 

My girlfriend is lucky to get 2 minutes out of me and that’s the way it’ll stay"

"When I was 18 or so I went to the doc for a checkup. He wasn't in so I saw this cute RN instead.

She's on my mind pretty much 100% of the time.  I guess it might sound a bit cliched, but I'll be damned if that's not how it is.  "

"In high school I got friends with some edgy guy, because he liked the same music as I did back then. I thought it would be cool to have someone to talk about music. He was toxic as hell and had anger issues, even though he never really bursted out of it on me. He was kind of an asshole and made me one too. The deal is, i was an asshole from the inside but I always left all unpleasant comments for myself, so I guess he woke up that demon which lived inside of me. Now, 3 years after high school I kind of regret that I was dealing with him in the first place. He was also neurotic and a lotta people told me he treated me like shit for joking about me being fat and why am I even friends with him.I never cared about my fat to be even offended. 

I’ve seen him on New Year’s Eve a year ago and he found himself a girl that is even worse than him. We ( me and my pals) don’t deal with him no more, as he banged his gf in my pals home on my pals bed and made such a mess we couldn’t get it back to the state before the incident. "

OFFLINE: my first weekend at college a guy came up to me and asked “do you also not shave like in asian porn?” And I’ve also been asked to my face how tight I am. Had my first panic attack lol 

Hope this clarifies! "
I'm now imagining a human backpack.
Why did I read this
"I look kinda effeminate, so most of the girls who were into me are into this kinda east asian standard of beauty. This is problematic because western standards of beauty are distinctly not this, and the west is where I live. People who find me attractive in my lifetime have mainly included a portion of asian girls and most asian grandmas. And more recently, kpop fans. Tbh I’m lucky I can even say that.

In the west, asian guys are desexualized. We’re seen as the lowest rung among the dating prospects of our gender. My experiences have affirmed this, and I do not-so-hot on dating apps. I mean I do better if more asian people are in the area, but even then Asian American girls are least likely to date within the demographic. See asian male desexualization.

The biggest impact that this has on me is that I am genuinely confused when someone is into me. Like I don’t have low self esteem in most parts of my life, but I’ll just be like “wait what are you doing this never happens”. I have that notion of being undesirable, and it holds me back mentally and romantically.

So Asian guys should know not to be bitter about the whole desexualization thing. It’s important to be aware of our disadvantages, but not to let that knowledge get in the way of more important things like improving yourself as a person. 

Having self confidence and communication skills and interests to share have done a lot more for me than getting hung up on the epidemic of asian emasculation. Some guys become toxic and pretty sexist. Not great. Like I always say, “Don’t hate, self-actualize.” I’ve never said that. But now it’s a thing."
"Is he at Greendale? That guy's friend Ahbed is weird. Cool, but weird."
"This is the same for me, it kind of sucks honestly. I haven’t had a guy best friend since high school and I really miss it. I’ve got a pretty large close group of guy friends now, but there’s no one I would really say is a “best friend” besides my girl friend. "
Cause usually the girl I'm talking to is talking to other 10 guys. 
"That's just a nice way of saying you don't seem fun. Smile, laugh at jokes. Pretty girls sitting at the bar with rbf looking like I am going to be the only one laughing at my jokes, kills my boner. No one gets off work to hang out with people that are too serious."

"Ha-ha ... I did that once.

We'd just moved into a new house, the dog started barking in the middle of the night. I jumped up and ran into the edge of an open door. That door barely moved and doesn't have a mark. My forehead on the other hand.

My wife had a bee sting on her lip and it grew really fat, I had a crease in my forehead. She said she didn't want to be seen in public with me because it looked as if I'd punched her in the mouth, and she creased my forehead with a frying pan."
"If you get mocked to your face about your girlfriend then your friends are cunts and you might be better off without them.

"It took me a while but, I have this friend who only speaks to me when he findshimself alone. But when I try to talk to him, he just ignores me, he prefers other people rather than me even when he said I was his best friend and loved me. I'm just tired of it. I even have had my own problems and there's not been anyone there for me."

"Asian male here, and I grew up in a pretty urban and liberal area in the states, so I would say it depends a lot on where you are at, your personality, and how people are raised. I doubt I would have had the same dating experience if I was somewhere more conservative, such as the rural south.

Dating as a teenager was practically nonexistent, but that may have been more because of myself more than anything related to the fact that I was Asian. As an adult, I never really had any negative aspects in terms of dating because of my ethnicity, though I must admit that I prefer offline more than online dating as I have more success offline, but it may be because it just feels more natural that way. 

My advice is that you should really go out and keep trying, offline or online. Dating is hard in general, but if you feel like people don't want to date you because of you're Asian, then you're not missing out as you shouldn't be dating those people anyway. 

EDIT: from reading your comments, I realized you're a woman and just wanted to some experiences. So sorry and ignore the last part. I can say, it took a bit for my folks to adjust to me dating outside my ethnicity, but that's partly because they were super tradition. "

"Married for more than five years now; I think about my wife constantly. When I wake up in the morning I roll over to see her, and make sure she's comfortable. I usually get up a few hours before her, and I get some alone time. Still, when she gets up I get my morning hug. Morning hugs are the absolute best part of my day. When I'm at the university, I occasionally think about how I want to to talk to her about something. If I see flowers blooming, I text her a picture of them. On my way home, I think that I can't wait to see her. Before I go to sleep, I poke her leg (it's part of our personal language, I'm just telling her I love her). 

Being gone at work isn't so bad, but when one of us is gone for a couple of days I feel like I'm missing something integral, like a limb. I look for her, and get a little sad when I remember.

She's no doubt my best friend. "

There wasn't as much of a sudden moment as much as a creeping realisation that he had gone from a run of the mill narcissist to a borderline sociopath. Plus I found out he was racist as fuck. Ended with him insulting me in a way that only a former best friend could do. Knowing full well that I was in the middle of a depression of the worst kind. Damn near killed me.

"I was at a club like 4 years ago, and saw this girl taking down her pants and starting to pee. Obviously she was shitfaced, but this is not the end of the story. The club had the dancefloor and a bar on the first (upper) floor. She started peeing on the first floor next to the bar, and the pee made its way into the dancefloor and people had a “golden shower” without knowing it."

A comment that proved to be the first of many about how people who need meds for mental health are “weak” and “lazy.” 
"&gt; How physically close / intimate do you get with your female best friend?

 I've had 2 female best friends and they have ended up being more than friendships at some point.

&gt; What I don’t understand is why he wants to get physical with me.

 It's blatantly obvious that he wants to pursue something with you. The fact that he is dating or in a relationship doesn't really change that. Having said that you are just as guilty as he is and the reason you haven't put an end to it is because he is a solid source of emotional support.

 &gt; the second I’m intoxicated I let him do it because
&gt;  we party together a lot

 If this is the root of the problem (it's not) then stop drinking around him. Your liver will thank you later anyway.

&gt; For what it’s worth, I would never kiss / sleep with him but I know we’re already crossing boundaries.

 Yeah, he's pretty much a dick and you're not helping. I mean as of right now he is cheating, cause I'm sure you and anyone else reading this would lose their shit if they found their SO doing this behind their back.

 I realize this is something you want due to comfort and what is provided. However you are seriously going to have to put your foot down here. At the end of the day you wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of this."
Those are pretty much your options lol

Have you read Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari? I don’t think he mentions Indian males in his book but he does mention the differing experiences for different ethnic males! It was a good book u should check it out. I hear the same. My Indian male friends have a hard time dating out of their ethnicity and they mostly blame their parents for not being able to! I had a friend who had to break up with his girlfriend because she was too dark?? 
"Around the time of the 2016 election, a friend of mine started talking about things that were unusual for him. His political views started shifting, and he told me about this emerging political movement called the ""alt-right"". This was 6 months or so before the alt-right went mainstream and people knew what it was, but it sounded very suspect to me at the time. I began questioning whether or not I should be friends with him, despite our long history and him being one of the best friends I've ever had in my life.

I ignored that feeling and we stayed friends. We had many, very candid, discussions about his political persuasions and he eventually started moving away from it. There's one other person in his life who took the same approach with him that I did. But I wonder if he would have kept going further and further had I decided to abandon that friendship.

I'm glad we stayed friends, and that he was able to get out of that. A lot of those candid discussions we had revealed that a lot of his involvement with the alt-right was because he was in a very very dark place mentally, and I think having stable people in his life that didn't abandon him helped a lot."

"I think it depends on who its coming from and the situation. If its coming from a dude they think is ugly or for whatever reason are just not attracted to, they think everything is said dude trying to flirt. An opened door, a compliment, even him just checking her out. 



If its coming from a dude she is attracted to, she is immediately overthinking it, wondering if he is flirting. He could be doing the same gesture.



My example is im deployed right now. There are 4 girls in my workplace and about 50 dudes. One of these girls absolutely thinks every dude there wants her. Shes cute which makes her a desert 10. I dont know, there may be truth to it, but i heard her say to somebody else, ""all of them have tried but they eventually get over it""... and it made me chuckle to myself because i think shes one of the most annoying people there. I look forward to her day off more than my own day off. And i AM a thirsty single dude in the desert."

"It’s pretty crappy.

Asian women shit on you for being Asian. White men constantly make you feel inferior by putting you down.

Seriously the best. My ex and I didn't live together but she stayed over at my place more than half the week. I found it so hard to sleep alone after we broke up that I ended up sleeping on my couch to switch it up and took melatonin.
She was super sensitive about it and tried to hide it so I just didn't mention it but it was such a large tattoo! 
"Ok here's how I do it, I'm highly extroverted with zero social anxiety so YMMV. I go it o a room, and I subtly scan for other people looking around the room. Usually 75% of the people looking around the room are broadcasting nerves and fear, and I'm less likely to approach them. But the 25% who look casual and relaxed, at home in their own skin and just taking in the room - I'll go up to them and ask ""hey, do you mind if we share a table?"" Because they're obviously not scared and awkward, conversation is then easy.

Now if you don't want to do that, then you have to be that 25% person who's minding their own business casually but also has their attention turned outward to the room, with a gaze that can be found and met. The first time someone meets your gaze, smile. The second time, hold the gaze. The third time, offer a greeting or salute like a nod with a smile. Build the familiarity. Sooner or later, the person you're building an unspoken rapport with across a room will come over and say hi. Even if it takes a few occasions.

I actually go to meetups where there will be big crowds and I don't know anyone, deliberately. I consider it sort of an extreme sport - some people basejump, some people work a room. What terrifies other people thrills me, and vice versa. You can get really good at it, and it becomes second nature."

Besides, the vast majority of these look to be hygiene and smell issues. "
"Honestly, one of my best friends for the longest time would take advantage of the fact that I was always willing to spot her for food or movie tickets or whatever. She's always be like ""oh...well I only have this much."" and me, wanting us to have a good time and hang out, would say ""no worries I got you."" And she would say ""ok let's go!"" (Mind you we were in high school, neither of us working.) 

Once I finally caught on to it I put a stop to it real quick. One day it was the same deal, she ""only had money for lunch or a movie, not both."" I looked at her and our convo went something like this:

Me: ""Well I guess we're only gonna do 1. You pick.""

Her: *looks at me stunned and a little speechless* ""oh....ok.""

Me: *waits for her to pick*

Her: ""Lemme pee first."" (A minute later) ""oh hey I found an extra $40! Looks like we can do both!""

Ever since then when I pull that on her, she magically~ finds the money real quick."

If you're going to hang the laundry to dry, make sure it's hung in such a way that it will actually dry.  If you're going to walk the dog, make sure its feet and yours are clean before you come back into the house.  If you're going to cook dinner, don't leave the kitchen as a disaster area.  If you're going to meal plan and do the grocery shopping, make sure you buy food she'll actually eat.  

In general, clean up after yourself.  She shouldn't have to put your dirty clothes into the laundry hamper, or clean your beard shavings from around the bathroom sink, or put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher, or move your empty beer cans to the recycling bin..."

"&gt;Of the white guys who matched with and messaged me, it was clear they had an asian girl fetish.

What made this clear?

I'm a white dude living in Sydney, which has a high Asian population, and so many of the women that come up in my tinder pool are Asian (the majority is white, but there are still many Asian women).

As a result, I've dated quite a few Asian women in 2018 *(again, more white women, but nevertheless, quite a few Asian women)*. On at least half of these dates, one of the first questions I was asked was if I had yellow fever.

I don't have yellow fever. And there is nothing on my rather plain profile to indicate that I may have, so I assume they were asking purely because I am white.

I told them ""No"". Some of them accepted this, but others did not, and would repeatedly bring it up."

Unfortunately for me, I'm part werewolf. I have thick long hair everywhere. I looked like I had furry stockings on with the budgys. So I thought, fuck it. I'll shave and see how I go. It'll regrow. 

It's a lot of effort but I feel like I can actually breathe. I feel cooler. The breeze feels great. I don't sweat as much wearing long pants. Swimming feels amazing. And considering how humid and fucked Brisbane summers are, I'll be sticking with it."
You can keep it 100 in this sub. That's what I like about it.
This is the most important thing in this thread
Please buy me a book. I promise to be the 1/10. 
If only i could do that. My gf is always cold and sleeps with 30 layers of clothes a saunarobe and 7 blankets on top of her.
Bold of you to assume I sleep with other people 
I’m so sorry you lost her.
"Never trailed off for us, but then we didn’t have kids, so maybe that’s the magic recipe."
Damn this cracked me up poor Rachel 
"A friend of mine incessantly texted and called me, and would question me about why I hadn’t responded on such and such day and time. I had a hard time getting space.

She also would gossip about other people in really negative ways. It seemed like someone else’s personal business was in the forefront of her mind, and she hardly had  a compassionate view or a kind word to say about anyone.

Last straw for me was that I would hear her out for hours as she talked about whatever was on her mind. But the moment I tried to talk she’d pick up her phone and scroll through Instagram.

I broke up our friendship at the parking lot outside her house 6 years ago. Good riddance. "
"I'm really glad this is here. A lot of this thread seems to be about ""helping her out"" with things around the household for which, presumably, they are both responsible.

Treat her as your *equal* partner in all things, including chores and emotional labor."
Kinda wasted your 30's on birdwatching.
"Did you know that when the smaller person is in the Big Spoon position it’s called ‘Jet Packing’? 

It’s a personal favorite."
"I feel more comfortable in my pajamas. Also Idk why but I hate the feeling of my duck flapping and moving when I change my position. And I change my position *a lot* before sleeping. 

Edit: yes, my duck. You read well. What you lookin at ?


Edit 2: Silver ? Mommy ! Look at me ! I'm part of the big boys now!!!
Thank you"
I had to read through twice for comprehension and a third time for the joy of it. What a ride. 
"Deciding to be with someone 'less attractive' is the same as choosing to be with someone 'more attractive'

&amp;#x200B;

Appearance should be way down on your list of priorities for a relationship simply because you spend most of your time not looking at your SO.  If you want to be purely surface level I suggest finding one with a beautiful voice, as you will listen to them more than you will look at them.  Just think of folding laundry or driving to the store.  Are you going to do this looking at your SO's face?

&amp;#x200B;

When you think about compatibility, religion, smoking preference, conversation, life goals, travel preferences, hobbies, it is amazing that looks ever make it to the list in the first place.   We live in a society where visual media is ubiquitous so it's natural we end up putting a little more importance on appearances but we've gone way overboard.  


I had someone show me a picture of their wife in their 20s then say she only looked that good for 15 years, and how unfair it was that she no longer looked that way.  They were still married.  I felt sorry for her.  


He didn't say she was a brilliant mother, someone that inspired him, someone that took good care of him.  His first description of his wife to me was someone that had passed her expiration date and he was depressed about it.  


If you're into looks, you can be happy for 15 years - max.  Assuming you can randomly find someone that you can stand to be around (or that can stand to be around you) that long.  


If you're into someone's life - their goals their aspirations their beliefs their accomplishments..... that is the shit lasts a lifetime."
I mean tbf semi drivers make good money sometimes 
NO
This wins the prize for me jesus hahaha 
"She said she'd help out with my rent before she came, so I was happier to buy things before hand as I thought I had the budget for it. It's okay, I'll have a job soon and be back to normal in no time."
My buddy's dad uses the car keys to remotely close the door whenever his wife opens the minivan door.  It's hilarious.

same here. idk how people even survive without that outlet. like you need to open up. its unhealthy not to do so. 
"Oh god, I knew someone like that. She tried to convince people she had bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anemia, amnesia, narcolepsy, cancer, and a hardcore drug problem. If you actually tried to give her some sound advice or make an appointment with a therapist for her, she’d flip a tit. While I do think there was something not right with her, most of what she did was solely for attention. 

Edit: this was the 8th grade to give some perspective of how old we were"
I dated a guy who argued that all women should douche because vaginas are dirty by default. He was an ER physician.  I lost a lot of respect for the medical profession after dating him.

"Be descriptive, tell him what seeing him does to you and how you feel about his body. Telling him he's hot is basic as you can get.

This sort of thing is why having a broad and varied vocabulary helps in communication. It allows people to use colorfully descriptive words to express their thoughts and feelings."
I don't even know what my best friends from high school are up to these days. 
"You're thinking of /r/BoneHurtingJuice, which is just sillyness. BoneAppleTea is for people who spell out words they've never seen in writing. The word you were looking for is comeuppance."
It's common enough to go out of your way to return a wallet to a *stranger.* I'd be royally pissed if a 'friend' cared so little that they didn't bother to let me know they found it. Fuck that person. This isn't misplacing a book or a pair of gloves. Missing your wallet really messes up your life for a while. 
"This. I’m a furnace. 

It also helps that morning wood rubbing against soft sheets feels 🤤 nothing like starting the day out turned on."
"A hot colleague came into my office and asked if I wanted to play with her. A customer/friend visiting me pretty much gave me the nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more...

Shame she was talking about badminton "
"I got a full-time job. Granted, it's just over minimum wage and it's not in my field but when I made more in one month than I had saved up at that point, I'm not gonna complain. I hadn't had *dick* in income for like 4 years until then so any spending money is nice. In 9 months, I managed to save up almost 7k so I'm pretty fucking pleased with myself."
"Some people had parents who couldn’t be fucked to teach their children how to stay clean. It takes an outsider to come along and say whoa, you gotta wash your ass. That’s a thing and you must do it. Lol"

I live alone. Reddit is my family and I am never alone.
"The thing is with Tinder: even the times when my convos were on point, I was being funny and interesting and the girls were responding positively, they all still flaked when it came time for a date. 

I feel like a lot of girls are on Tinder for validation and have no intentions of actually using it to date. "
You're doing husbandry the right way.
"I had gotten to a point where I had no other friends, she was it. Ending that friendship was nearly as hard as when I left my husband. I was under so much control from her.

I took a stand in 2017 to say goodbye to toxic relationships though, 2018 was the start of rebuilding my life... Here's to 2019!"
"I know I don't always treat it the best but I generally trust my butt.

We've been through a lot together."
"Sigh. 

If you're in a long term monogamous relationship with a woman you should know whether she likes middle-of-the-night-half-asleep-surprise-sex or not... just because she didn't sign and date a series of forms in triplicate consenting to the act, it's not sexual assault. 

Now, if you're sleeping with a woman for the first time and she wakes up with your parts in her parts, you probably should have cleared that with her first.

Common sense, really. "

"Some more to the awesome list by Gentlewaves123 (Thank you!)

14. Spend time with her alone, play video game or board game or any outdoor game with her

15. Cook simple dishes (if you can) for her, a simple toasted bread and omelette can also do (Breakfast in bed on random weekends)

16. Take extra care when she is under the weather

17. Take long walks with her after dinner.

18. Do things she was not expecting you to do. Like if she does the dishes most of the time - Occasionally do it before she can get to it. Drop in at lunch time (either at her office if she works close by or if your home is close, if possible) and take her out to lunch (Something you haven't done before).

19. Make an art, decoration, write a song, a poem or something with your own hand and gift it to her randomly

20. Learn a few NEW tricks in the bed and surprise her

21. Lastly, I am sure you love your kids but spend more time with them (If you have them). Women LOVE it when dad loves their kids to death (Not saying you don't but show it), don't shy away from loving them. Kiss them randomly, let them know you are there to help them with their homework if they need it, get involved with them in non-intrusive way."
"I'd say sometimes it's more like expecting grape juice and instead getting 'purple drink.' 

It's *kinda* what you expected, but not really, and though you may drink it it's definitely not as good as you thought you were getting."
That is horrific. That poor dog. :(
"Yea but the problem is getting up in the morning and having to walk to find pants, then again I suppose you could turn the heater on higher"
Great plan. 
If we're already in the bedroom with you. There's next to nothing you can say or do to screw that up. Trust me.

"Follow up question:

Are you ever afraid you’ll shit your bed with a gamble of a fart?

Geez thanks for making me feel insecure you guys"
Gee I wonder what he did to get thrown out.
"This. My wife is out of town for the first time since we got married, and having to go to bed without being able to talk while laying next to her is really...depressing. "
When you're the only one putting forth any effort. 
"Trucking dispatcher here.    Emailed a warehouse asking to bring in a last minute load and the  scheduling lady responded ""I would love to receive your load tonight"".  

Still laugh about that often. "
Feels like you air balled the winning point of the NBA finals. 
"I was just at a bar last night and this woman was staring at me all night, she finally came up to me and pressed up against me, whispers in my ear “you’re cute” licks my cheek and walks away.... the bartender bought me a shot because even he was uncomfortable witnessing that."
"She hates when I put my cold hands against her when we’re in bed, which only pushes me to do it more, though she has given me a pass for inner thigh so I can warm them up.

Any little “non-girlie” thing she does like fart or burp I’ll start saying how nasty and disgusting it is while wrapping her in my arms to kiss her and tease her so she knows I’m not serious. 

If she asks me to do a little favor, no matter what I’ll just say “no” and still do it. 

I’ll mess with her ears because we like to do some ear nibbling when teasing eachother, so sometimes when we’re in public or something I’ll sneak a soft breath on her ear or slightly bite it when we’re just working on projects or something. Her reactions are always the best and  I love her mannerisms from it. She gets even with me though by doing the same things.  "
Does she hang the toilet paper in the correct manner.
But why would you go around with some animated expression when you aren’t engaging with someone? Why is there an expectation there that id she isn’t smiling at the candle she’s looking at then she must be a cold b?
"It’s crazy how much certain cultures perpetuate that idea.

I’m a white woman and my SO is half Korean. His mother’s family disowned her when she married my SOs father back in the day (6’3” white military sergeant) because of his race. They moved to America shortly after my SO was born.

Somehow my SOs mom inherited her fathers house in Korea after he died. Her sister came to the US under the impression that they would become close again. She became sort of a nanny figure to my SO during his toddler years, only for my SOs mom to find out that her sister was only interested in trying to take the house in Korea from her. That’s the ONLY reason she came to the US.

My SOs mom told her she could have the house. If that’s what she wanted she “should have just asked and she would have given it to her.” Then she made her leave and they never spoke again.

My SO and I have a son together, who is now 1/4 Korean of course. 

My impression of Korean culture has changed significantly from the stories my SO tells. I have a ton of respect, but the amount of racism within the culture is just mind boggling to me. I really had no idea."
"She was super competitive and athletic so we'd play basketball, racquetball, go for runs together.  There was nothing outdoors or involving some type of competition she'd say no to.  If we were spending a weekend together and the guys wanted to play basketball she'd want to play to, I could do what I wanted to do without having to make too many sacrifices.

The sex was also ridiculous....just flat out ridiculous.  Something I've never been able to replicate with another partner since.

Unfortunately most of my friends and all of my family didn't care for her.  Her personality was abrasive and I started to realize this wasn't the type of person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with."
"In the middle of the day, squat down on a hiking trail and take a shit. There were plenty of bushes and rocks but she thought ""Somebody ought to want to walk/run through shit and piss, right?""."
"""drugs"" cannabis and the rest or ""drugs"" medication ?"
"Quite a few years back now. Was out with friends towards the end of the night I get chatting to a girl we hit it off and she's is beautiful couldn't believe my luck. So we all leave the club at same time and we are stood waiting for taxis, one pulls up and she turns round and says loud enough that our entire group could hear ""you can come back to my place if you like but I've currently got crabs"" That was a hard NO. I do look back and wonder what I would of done if on my own. Don't think I will ever forget not that my mates ever will still comes up every now and again. "
That was unexpectedly wholesome.  Good for him for actually and consistently turning his life around.  It's one thing to have that moment of truth time where you are apologetic to everyone.  It's another to actually live that life.  Cool story. 
I was telling a friend about how I chose not to sleep with this girl after a weekend at the bars because she was sloppy drunk and he basically called me a pussy for it. Told me I passed on easy ass.
"Female here. I'm usually big spoon, but we trade off. I like being big spoon and get as close and spoony as possible and I'll squish the side of my face against his upper back as a sort of pillow. Once in a while I get drool on his back. We have an unspoken understanding."
"I’m pretty sure that, “Just because he likes my ass” is also acceptable. "
