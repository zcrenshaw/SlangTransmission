"A lot of people think that we are looking right at them when we are standing still, this is because you can‚Äôt see my eyes whilst wearing the bear skin hat, and they wave.

What I am actually doing is scanning without moving my head. Although we have police around with us, we still have a job to do and so have to look for threats.

Another thing people do is ask me questions as they take pictures with me. I can‚Äôt answer back.

A lot of people thank me for having a picture with them and get a bit annoyed that I wont acknowledge them.

But none of it is annoying. It‚Äôs a great job and very serious too.

Hope this helps."
"I guess you‚Äôre asking because there‚Äôs ‚Äúrumours‚Äù going around that the queen is going to die on that day.

I‚Äôm currently on Christmas leave at the moment, but would maybe be called back into work if she does.

Where has this rumour come from?"
"I haven‚Äôt had to or seen any of the guys physically take down anyone. We are swarmed by armed police at all times and they would take the lead in that situation.

It would be very difficult to run after people in our boots and uniform so it‚Äôs great that the police are there.

I have only ever told people to get down from climbing the gate at Buckingham Palace. Usually kids climbing. All we do is stand to attention and then shout to get down.

Hope this helps."
Cream cheese. 
"Are you working January 5th? 
 "
"I would like to present to you this 4 course meal:

Soliloquy 

Meticulous 

Paradigm 

Ramshackle 


How did it taste?"
"Have you ever actually had to take down someone at the gate, or have you only done that, ""Stand back from the Queens guard!""?"
"In part, yes, most definitely. "
"It's tough to choose off the top of my head, but two of my favourites are 'use' (tastes like my favourite cheese) and 'sponge' (doesn't taste like any food I know of, so I can't describe it very well...sort of mildly sweet and watery). One of the worst-tasting words I can think of right now is 'off', which tastes like a combination of blue cheese and rotten veg."
"If you have a kid, will you name them based on their flavor?"
How does the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù taste like?
File a claim with your state/national entity's wage department tomorrow.  You are a victim of wage theft.
What is the most annoying thing tourists do to you or your fellow Guardsmen?

"It was a very long and frustrating process. But it mostly was just listening to stories and seeing photos from my family alongside with working with my therapist. It was like reading a biography about a stranger who just happened to be myself. 
 
Essentially the only thing I lost was my identity. So I had complete knowledge of basic skills like reading and all that. I was completely capable physically as well. Interestingly, I had to relearn how to do everyday feminine things that had once been routine to me (putting on makeup, wearing bras, feminine care, etc.) while I had not forgotten non-gendered things (brushing my teeth, tying my shoes, etc.). I think this is because my sense of my gender was directly associated with my personal identity. Weird I know.."
Then Guardsmen from generations past acting like knobs. Now we have strict rules.
"Our role is to guard whichever establishment and its occupants we‚Äôre posted on. 

We still have to power to use appropriate force as necessary to dispel any threat.

It is indeed very much a symbolic role which has been a very long tradition and one that tourists love to see.
A lot of people would think to have armed police take over our role permanently, but then I‚Äôd be out of a job üëå

We carry the standard service weapon of the British Army (SA80 A2) with magazine and bayonet fixed. It‚Äôs an extremely unnecessarily heavy weapon compared to other modern rifles.

Hope this helps."
"It all goes back to traditions. When the foot guards were formed they were allowed to talk and move about, but thanks to their acting like ass‚Äôs we now have strict rules at what not to do üëçüèª

Females are now allowed to join the infantry regiments of the army.

So from next year the guards are open to females."
"We usually do 72 hour rotations where we do the big changing of the guard.

Our guard shifts are 2 hours and depending on how many Guardsmen on the rotation we could do one, two or maybe three shifts a day.

The time does drag like crazy, but if you‚Äôre doing your job properly then it isn‚Äôt too bad.

A lot of the guys I know are fed up with the ceremonial side of things and can‚Äôt wait to get to the point where we as a regiment concentrate on our infantry role.

It‚Äôs not for everyone, but it‚Äôs not too bad of doing 2 hours of work in a day and getting paid for it.

For anyone looking to join the Army, I would certainly say look at all your options first.

Hope this helps."
"Best tasting word?
Worst?"
"For your first question: I was fully aware of the role of the Guards and was something I wanted to do. A few guys join because they get steered that way in the recruiting office.

Your second question: it‚Äôs 32 weeks training at the Infantry Training Centre and we wore either the red tunic or grey coat (depending on the time of year) towards the end of training. We go through a few more weeks training than traditional infantry units concentrating on the foot drill techniques.

Hope this helps."
Where's the cocaine and Jameson I asked for like three years ago?
"Dealing with threats and tourists are sort of a shared responsibility.

The kids that climb on the fence or gates at Buckingham Palace are told to get down by me, but the police would specifically go to them to make sure they aren‚Äôt going to do it again.

As with the threats it would be the police that would have more control, however we would do what we could to assist the police.

In other words if someone scaled a fence at one of the palaces or castles, I wouldn‚Äôt just stand there and shout the police over. Depending on the type of threat and of the opportunity called for it I would certainly be in a position to use the bayonet if needed.

If a tourist is being a cheeky bugger and isn‚Äôt listening to me shouting at them to get back from me, then the police can and will make them move away.


Hope this helps."
"Yes.

I'm embarrassed to say some words because they taste so bad, and I just can't get my head around the fact that other people can't taste the yuckiness."
"Sorry man, had to use it myself to keep up through the night. Maybe next year?"
"I‚Äôve only heard stories from other Guardsmen about ghosts etc. But I‚Äôve never seen or heard anything.

A lot of the places that we Guard were used as execution grounds back in the day, so it‚Äôs pretty easy to stir the imagination.

The Guards buildings where we sleep and eat etc are very old, but are very modern inside.

We have gym equipment, Internet, tv and all modern luxuries.

We sleep in bunk beds which aren‚Äôt too bad.

All food is cooked by fantastic chefs and there is plenty of it. It is all free whilst we are on guard. There is also tea/coffee and juice throughout the day and biscuits, crisps and sandwiches too.

Hope this helps."
Did you have to re-learn stuff you learned in school? Or is that still kept safely stored? 
"Two questions: Did you begin your military career with the ambition of being one of the Queen‚Äôs Guards or was it an opportunity you came across? Second, what type of specific job training did you receive and were you required to wear the dress uniform during training?"
"And I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs all they have in mind, not."

"You have an open relation ship with your BF? Who you said was 28yrs old 14 days ago...and also said he was 29yrs old 14 days ago on a different post. Andd you're getting married next summer? Where is he on New Years?

Edit: This blew up! I was doing the obligatory Gonewild search in her history and saw all of these post. Thank you kind strangers."
"Yeah we are told whenever we are posted on guard to act in a smart soldier like fashion.

But if it‚Äôs just me and dozens of tourists then I‚Äôm gonna have my fun too.

If a superior or officer is present then I would be stern."
"Does it mean that the armed police are in charge of the bad guys who try to break in, and you guys take care of the ordinary actions like tourists' manners?  (Asking with full respect!)"
"Your name has a pretty neutral taste, which is good - a little like rice paper. "
"As we learn at Guard depot and looking through historical photos and paintings the guardsmen were able to converse with the public and drink while on guard duty.

I believe Guardsmen drinking alcohol vs the public didn‚Äôt mix and now we‚Äôre here."
"In all honesty it is an incredibly difficult document to summarise because of all the ‚ÄúScientologese‚Äù jargon which I imagine one is expected to know before they pay onto the OT I course. There are various books that you‚Äôre supposed to have read and courses that you‚Äôre meant to have completed before joining (and the documents repeatedly highlight a lack of good progress on these courses as a major component of failure in the OT sections). Every now and again there‚Äôs a spelling/grammatical error which I‚Äôd expect better from a religious document, and a lot of it is written in L Ron Hubbard‚Äôs illegible spider scrawl. 

Before you start you‚Äôre meant to be ‚Äúclear‚Äù which you attain after lots of auditing. In OT I the aim is to get you to understand your body is not you, you are a thetan (a soul I guess?) and teaches you how to understand the world from a MEST perspective (matter, energy, space, time). Supposedly someone who‚Äôs completed all the levels is meant to be able to move/manipulate matter with their minds etc. OT 2 was a lot of repeating conflicting affirmations and visualising your unconsciousness and honestly made little sense. OT III was the fun bit where it describes an incident where souls from other planets were dropped into volcanoes and hydrogen bombs dropped on top by a fellow called Lord Xenu who was head of a council, about to be elected out and wanted to do something big before he was. As punishment he‚Äôs trapped electronically inside a mountain and has been for thousands of years. These souls in volcanoes now cling to your thetan and cause you problems, negativity, sickness etc and you need to properly initiate mind control stuff to ‚Äúblow them off‚Äù. It has to be done properly though, as you will get pneumonia if you do it wrong, according to L. Ron Hubbard. 

Edit: corrected an acronym "

"Hmm this is a good question.. I do often experience this sensation, but I‚Äôm not sure that deja-vu is the best way to describe it. I think that ‚Äútip of the tongue‚Äù feeling you get when you can‚Äôt quite remember something is more accurate. The bigger issue though is determining which of these almost-memories are real and which ones I‚Äôve created subconsciously."
"It's hard to imagine ""sponge"" not tasting awful, let alone one of the best. Interesting!"
I saw your original comment and just wanted to pop in and say hi. I picture things in descriptive words. Others are often confused by this and usually end up telling me how much I‚Äôm missing out on. My biggest fear is that I‚Äôd have to recall something for a police investigation. Have you had a time when it was just incredibly inconvenient? 
"First course: slightly stale meat and milky Weetabix

Second course: Magic Stars chocolates

Third course: pineapple and metal

Final course: corned beef and metal

These are rough approximations of the tastes - lots of the flavours I experience don't correspond to any foods I'm aware of :) "
What are your powers? What can you do in what situation? Is it just a symbolic role? What kind of weapons do you carry?
What is the purpose or tradition behind not acknowledging and talking to people?
Do curse words have tastes? Are they satisfying or gross?
"It‚Äôs not that heavy actually.

However, wearing it for 2 hours or more it certainly aces the neck a little.

It also pushes down on the front of the head and this for me causes a little headache.

It‚Äôs real bear skin and fur too and we give them a good wash and shampoo about once a month to keep the fluffiness and to make them smell a bit better.

I‚Äôve known guys that have had people try and stroke their bearskins while they‚Äôre on guard and this is a big no no."
"Other brit here, Not a question but thanks for your service and have a happy new year."
Do you alter your vocabulary to choose words that taste better to you?   
"You should definitely come here and visit and definitely see the Changing of the Guard.

The marching about thing we do is called ‚Äòpatrolling‚Äô. This lets us get a good view of our surroundings without moving our heads whilst stood still. It also lets us move our body because standing still, even for 10 minutes, isn‚Äôt very good for the body.

We can‚Äôt listen to any radios or eat/drink, scratch our noses or any tiny movements like this.

I have personally smiled on some photos and when someone says a shit joke üòÇ but we‚Äôre still only human and we love a good joke.

I‚Äôd only tell someone to get back if they were physically touching me or my rifle. Other than that I love people swarming me and using flash on their phones üòÇüëå

Hope this helps mate."

"Cargo 117-A was an unfortunate accident, nothing more. We here at Clause Inc. have been dedicated to running a strict protocol of safety and security for all. The passing of one of the workers was definitely NOT a purposeful extermination, and our hearts go out to him and the rest of his (sadly, now deceased) family.

They do. It depends - the taste varies from curse word to curse word :) 
Why?
SUMMARIZE!!
"Happy new year!. 

I was once talking to an ex DPG who saw a ghost whilst posted outside St James' Palace. Have you or any of your mates seen anything weird at night or heard any odd stories?

Also where do you eat. Do you have a canteen and is it any good/reasonably priced?"
Yes sure make sure its the right one tho or u wont get the results u expected
"My apologies for a really stupid question but I‚Äôm the US so yeah. Anyway, why aren‚Äôt you allowed to speak or acknowledged people? Oh and another one, are females allowed to be Queensguards? If not, why? "
"How does it feel to be a badass?

"Asian guy who didnt speak english use his 11 y old looking daughter to speak to me, who had a hard time speaking english as well"

"""Describe your kid.""

"Food words usually taste like the food, but not always. 'Banana' definitely tastes like banana, albeit an overly ripe banana.

'Hot' tastes hot. 'Spicy' tastes hot but also of rice, salt, and a herb I can't remember the name of. 'Chilli' tastes hot and tomato-y. So yes! :)

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Some words even taste stronger than actual food, e.g. the name 'Katie' tastes like Party Rings with the sweetness amped up like crazy. It's difficult to describe what exactly it's like - the taste is in my mind and in the word instead of in my mouth, if that makes any sense at all.

I consider it a blessing.

Thanks for asking questions! Glad you're interested :) "
"The sound rather than the meaning. Synonyms don't tend to taste the same. Words that sound similar often taste similar, but not always. "
"Well, I'm not a complete idiot. I made it very clear it's not a hook up opportunity. We're also meeting up IRL in public on the 28th. Though guys who don't get it tend to tip their hand way faster than the meet-and-greet."
How do you feel about the government shutdown
 ‚Äç
"No one has touched me. Yet. But I know other guys that have been touched.
We usually yell at the person to get back. But sometimes just whispering to the person to pack it in works.

If they keep touching us and not listening to our commands, then the police will move them on.

And no one has flashed me or anyone I know üòÇ we stand in very public places so the person would have to have balls."
10/10. Damn I have less chance of dying now I am badass.
"Hi! I‚Äôve been worried about the police situation too! But it‚Äôs never been too inconvenient, the only times I‚Äôve noticed it have been times where we‚Äôve been in situations around imaging something, such as anger reducing tactics, like picturing a beach or other calming images. I think your description of how you ‚Äòsee‚Äô it is spot on, it‚Äôs really difficult to describe what it‚Äôs like! "
How much money did you make?
"For me personally it‚Äôs sometimes hard not to.

Especially if they tell a funny joke.

"Santa I have evidence of your wrong doings. We know about the elf in the toy train ""accident"" of 93. Do you care to comment?"
Wait really? The reason for all the seriousness is due to Guardsmen before you acting unprofessionally? 
Next year women are allowed to join? That‚Äôs awesome! Does it seem like the majority are for or against this change?
You too üëçüèª
Do you ever feel deja-vu? Like you felt that you knew something but couldn't place where it was from or how you knew it?
"Just guys saying that they‚Äôve heard noises whilst in the shower or while they were on the toilet.

But a lot of Guardsmen are young guys and love to talk shit most of the time.

The buildings we stay in are very old with old pipes and windows etc. So a lot of noises do happen that don‚Äôt sound ordinary.

Had a few guys saying they‚Äôve seen headless horsemen etc. It‚Äôs all good stuff to have a silent chuckle to ones self."
"I meant their weapons are always in a position to draw up in the shoulder when needed. Ours are by our side and would take longer to get in a firing position.

Plus our weapons aren‚Äôt initially loaded. "

"FUCK

what does that taste like?

Also, will you answer the 4-course meal the guy above gave you?"
"Have you or your colleagues ever completely lost it on duty? Either funny jokes, someone being a dick, etc? 

When I visited the UK me and my friends took a few snaps with the guard on duty, but we tried to be respectful and do it quick while we were far enough away not to be a hinderance 

However, I can‚Äôt imagine the types of people that you might encounter any given day."
"I absolutely love to read, and I suspect it's partly because my experience of words is so multisensory. I get hungry a lot when I read - some words elicit really intense tastes, and it makes me crave the corresponding foodstuff!

I think it's had a complicated impact on my relationship with food. I can't avoid the taste of food, so I get really sick of some tastes (e.g. I've been watching a lot of cooking competitions lately, and so I've heard the word 'chef' a lot - it tastes like salty pastry and gravy, and now the thought of eating pastry and gravy makes me want to throw up). On the flip side, because I crave the (often unhealthy) foods which correspond to some of the tastes I experience, it's really difficult to stick to the diet I'm trying to follow at the moment.

P. S. I'm so glad! It's a beautiful name :) "

"Absolutely. When these were released in 2008 onto wiki leaks the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù was very unhappy about it and tried to take it to court, but the courts were like ‚Äúno, these are religious documents and you‚Äôre a religious organisation so keep them online.‚Äù Each level gets progressively more expensive but I think each is around $5000 and you have to take many many courses previously. L Ron Hubbard was a science fiction writer and it‚Äôs pretty apparent from the whole Xenu story. Also every course is designed to get you to pay more - it‚Äôs included with miraculous outcomes and promises and if *you* didn‚Äôt reach those outcomes then that‚Äôs your fault and it‚Äôs time to pay up for another course so you can continue on this one. And it‚Äôs quite apparent, working through the levels, that in OT III where you‚Äôre suddenly told that you aren‚Äôt the reason for all your problems, these alien souls are, that the creator realised that they couldn‚Äôt keep promoting their techniques without radical new theology, but without having to backtrack (although saying that, there is a little bit of procedural backtrack)."

"Quite different actually. I hear that I was much more extroverted before, and I‚Äôm more socially anxious and reserved now. I think it‚Äôs very possible that this change has come as a result of the mild depression that I‚Äôve struggled with in the wake of all this as well. It‚Äôs getting better though and I‚Äôve become more energetic and outgoing as I‚Äôve become comfortable with myself."

We still do the usual 4 years minimum and there are no extra security checks etc. I guess after 32 weeks training the instructors would know if a person is crazy.

I‚Äôve personally been a few feet away from the queen and all the royal family. Never spoken to them though.

I‚Äôve also never been in a situation where I wasn‚Äôt on guard and i had to intervene. Whenever I‚Äôm not on guard I‚Äôm no where near any of the palaces or castles."

"How do you feel about the Queen of England's death on January 5th, 2019?"
"Iver never been to the UK and only know the queens guard via youtube videos. Is staying completely still and walking a bit once in a while the whole process? 

I assume listening to music/radio via small earpieces is not allowed either?

And how are you handling people that are trying to make you laugh? I'd never be able to stay serious and focused like the guards too.

Thank for the answers mate"
Nice to know!

What‚Äôs your favorite color?
"It's a well-studied problem with mapping a circular surface. Imagine a hairy ball, and trying to come it flat. There will always be a tuft. They put the tuft at the north pole because they don't expect anything to be there."
"Sounds like a bunch of bullshit. No expensive gifts that you got to keep? No yachts or jets bought on your name so that they're YOURS? No savings accounts for every child (including you)? You were grown-ass man when they supposedly died. No mansion or fancy appartement in NYC you got gifted because you turned 18/20/22/..?  Nothing that you, yourself OWNED? Quit that bullshit. There is no way - even people who live on the edge of poverty make sure their kids/ask their parents to get something they can OWN

The story is filled with holes. Either you're lying, or you (and your supposed rich dad) were the worst billionaire ever and didn't even have a clue how to manage and safeguard money for everyone. 

Next to that, you're even coming across like a failure of a son, playing call of duty when you should be doing some form of job (even if its easy). IF your parents were billionaires and IF you got disinherited by your dad, I bet it was his own personal choice because you disappointed him by relying too much on his hard earned wealth and by showing incompetence at a job that people would probably kill to get.

TL;DR: OP's story makes no sense and he is a troll and probably full of shit. AMA is riddled with fakes these days"
Apparently OP has forgotten that she posted this AMA. 
Literally üëå
Surprisingly no with the amount of curries and booze the blokes inhale.
r/me_irl id a sub that used to be entirely about stupid and ironic inside jokes but its gotten worse. Now we just spam jokes that the queens might die on the 5th and pictures of a fat version of bugs bunny called ‚ÄúChungus‚Äù
And then people want a pic taken and your stood there with a slime ‚Äòtache 
Probably not
He's playing that long game. 
"What happens when you discover
a new word that you haven‚Äôt heard of before? "
Just tell them to get back or just quietly ask them to stop
If I get caught justva stern telling off
Mostly because of the Hairy Ball Problem. It's hard for orbiting satellites to map the poles.
"Have you noticed anybody sitting outside your house, recording you yet? "
You‚Äôve  never had sponge cake?
Yes he has. I don‚Äôt know what happened to him recently because I usually don‚Äôt want to think/hear about him
"They‚Äôve stayed pretty much the same! Lasagna is (and will always be) my favorite food nowadays, and we have a classic family video of 10-year-me devouring this giant plate of lasagna haha. I love it. "
Possibly. You‚Äôd be a fool not to notice something in your bear skin.
But for real thanks for your service
"All I know is just try not to laugh.

But I‚Äôve definitely cracked a few times. Especially dad‚Äôs and their amazing jokes üëå"
"I just call all of them daddy, so maybe one day I'll find him."
We both like board games. It was in my bio and he mentioned he like them too. Seems like a decent way to spend the time.

"Has anyone touched you while on guard? If so, what is the protocol for that? 

Second question: has anyone ever flashed you? lol "
"While we are actually on guard then we can‚Äôt go to the bathroom. But when we come off then we can go.

Our rifles are not loaded with live magazines. I personally would prefer to have a few rounds, but the police definitely have plenty."
Exactly right üëçüèª
Watssap dude
"From a below post


Essentially the only thing I lost was my identity. So I had complete knowledge of basic skills like reading and all that. I was completely capable physically as well. Interestingly, I had to relearn how everyday feminine things that had once been routine to me (putting on makeup, wearing bras, feminine care, etc.) while I had no forgotten non-gendered things (brushing my teeth, tying my shoes, etc.). I think this is because my sense of my gender was directly associated with my personal identity. Weird I know..

"I have so many questions that I can't think of one concrete question. Have you ever looked into telling your story? Like in a podcast or written piece or something? I listen to a podcast called ""This is Actually Happening"" where people speak about things they've gone through like this. It would be really interesting to hear your story."
I'm just as confused as you are.
