"Uh, can you fight that?  She didn't attempt a purchase.  You didn't make a sale."
Sounds to me like regret at spending so much in headphones and looking for a reason to return them.
Be careful giving so much time and attention to one person at a booth. Sometimes person A will distract you while person B sidles up to the table and slips a print in their bag.
Chocolate with nuts because guys have them?
"  I refer to this personality type as (Paucity of Spirit). I used to work with a guy that would drive 30 miles round trip to save 5 cents a gallon on gas, He would make this trip solely for the gas. He would use four dollars of gas to save 2 dollars, I pointed out to him that he wasn't saving any money but losing money. This did not sit well with him even after I went over the 2nd grade math with him multiple times."
I'd love to know people's thought process when they try something like that.
"When you said biker group I was thinking ""oh it's gonna get scary."" Then when you said monkey on an old guy's head I was thinking ""this is gonna go apeshit"". Wound up being very wholesome and cute. No complaints from me and I do not need to speak with your manager."
$200 for some earbuds that only last a year or two before the battery starts to fail? I see nothing to regret!
Unfortunately she’ll probably become a Karen
"I would have peeled it off the counter, looked him dead in the eye and re-applied it to the item."
"It might be that the establishment is 18+

I worked in a cannabis dispensary for a while and we could get in trouble if anyone under the age of 21, or anyone without valid ID, was in the store."
"Yeah, I would challenge that."
"""Bubbles aren't for KIDS! They're WEAPONS used for crowd control!!!"""
"With these people (and they always exist somewhere) that come through looking for something someone else has bought (happens a lot at furniture shops not sure of other places) I usually say something like ""no you can't have their property and store policy will treat anything further as theft and act accordingly.  


Luckily you were on the case and a Karen goes without this fine holiday, all's well that ends well."
"He just wanted to be petty, I really can't understand people like that. Why go out of your way to be mean/annoying to people"
I..I guess just milk chocolate?
"No no, it's dark chocolate. Otherwise he won't grow up to be a MAN. Don't give him white chocolate though, because it's too feminine."
"Nope! After the same reaction from 2, MAYBE 3 prints I'd have just said ""I don't think my work is something you'd understand, here's your money back, have a nice day, please Leave my booth."""
When it dawns on you that CDs were around 20yrs ago and are kind of rare now.....
"I have caller ID at my store as a safety net for customers who have harassed myself and other staff in the past. I often have people spam calling the store and I get to the phone when I get to the phone. Customers that are in the store get served first. The phone only seems to ring when they are busy. Way more than half the time, it’s people asking stupid questions."
"This this this. Even customers who are being nice will sometimes be the decoy, or unwittingly used as a decoy by a thief. 

My advice? Get a small camera for your booth."
Speaking from someone who works at a paint desk and is constantly asked where’s this n that even though our isles say where stuff is I’m always pointing to customers never been told that it’s rude lol
"Customer: ""Hi, c-""

Apparently ideal employee: ""ID, NOW, OR I CALL THE COPS!!!"""
I thought this was common knowledge. Body jewellery is never returnable.
"Pointing at people is rude. Never heard someone claiming pointing at *objects* to be rude. I mean, is *the paint* offended?"
"When someone is hell bent on wasting my time on the phone, I will put them on hold several times; act like I'm the busiest person under the sun. It's petty, but it's all I got."
"We were a small shop so cashiers had to ask every single person that walked through the door for their ID. Whether they looked 18 or 80, which opened us up to a decent amount of verbal abuse from the older population."
Expecting you to card just because they asked about a restricted item would be like me refusing to disclose the location of the alcohol aisles in my grocery store or confirm beer is on sale until I carded them. Which is just silly.
"To them there are ""returns"" and there are ""refunds"" and they are not co-dependent.  She expected at least a gift card for her ""inconvenience""."
Did you have a mechanism for checking ID at the door then?  Or were the cashier's supposed to keep an eye out and request ID for browsers who looked under 21?
"Hahahah. The crew were all very kind, if a bit rowdy — one of them spilled a whole cup of coffee on the counter/floor, and he apologised profusely while he and some of his biker buddies cleaned it all up with napkins, even though both my manager and I said we’d take care of it. I tried to give him his next cup for free since he was so respectful (and saved me from scrubbing coffee off of the floor on my hands and knees), but he insisted I charge him for two, and then set down a $10 bill ($5.99 more than the two cups would have cost him in the first place) and walked away with a big ol’ grin before I could even open my mouth."
"Dude, when I was in High School my asthma was super bad. Like I had an asthma attack because I laughed too hard sort of bad. I didn't look terribly sick, but if I went shopping, I had to use the cart or I would have to stop ever 15-20 feet to catch my breath. I had so many people scold me for using the carts it wasn't funny. Luckily some new meds got me up and walking again, but it was a hard 3 months."
"When I was younger I would be super patient like that. Over the years I started adopting a slightly more stern ""Take it or leave it approach"". Now I'm just glad to be out of retail. It can really take it's toll after a while."
And make a formal complaint to the governing body.
"Omg thank you, I was feeling like I was in the wrong for responding like I did. 
I can't shake how immature sticking it to the counter was!!"
That sounds like an absolute nightmare and I'm sorry and totally relate. Some customers just walk in looking for a fight. It's also super inexcusable that he would mock you like that to your face. I know its easy to say 'don't let them get to you' than it is to do but you super don't need that negativity in your life and I hope you don't let that bring you down too much!
"florida stores go through this monthly either from weather or overloaded grid. there's usually a generator attached to the store for lower insurance rates, but it's always broken or out of fuel.


in my time i have helped discard $$$$$ melted icecream, defrosted tv dinners, and spoiled meats"
"Ah, but it must come from a pristine printer, calibrated by a archbishop under the light of a blood moon on an odd numbered year."
I've seen places just put the whole thing upside down so the cone is sticking straight up.
"Just PURE COCOA BEANS, the bar shape is for the weak!"
"This, especially if they seem to get financial kickbacks for testing/failing shops. No transaction was even attempted, and it isn't an age restricted shop, so a fail here is basically fraud if they get a payment for it."
"Most clothing shops here in Australia wont allow food or drinks inside.

I'm always amazed at what goes on in the US."
Teaching the new Karen's of the world hard life lessons.....and math
