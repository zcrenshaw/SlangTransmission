"Brilliant example of how sometimes a problem needs to be approached from the mindset of someone not enveloped in the problem. 

Well done. "
That's kinda how the story of NORAD's Santa Track happened.
Really shows the owners incompetence.  Send them to an Excel training class for a grand or train someone new from scratch for months. 
"funny. last time I did something similar, it was me who was out of a job. "
"&gt;I did not answer that email.

Probably best for your sanity"
"Well thats IT for you.

Everything is works fine why are we paying you

Nothing is working why are we paying you"
Sounds like the problem could be solved by administering some kyanide...

You are asking my hopeline tech to break federal law, thank you to requesting it via email though as I can now forward this request to legal, my manager, your manager, the CEO, the police, the FBI, the President, Son Goku, and his lord Jesus Christ.

This is why I have a policy of requiring a 50% deposit for an new client if not payment in full before doing a job. Also why contracts and delivery manifests are so important to get signed. I’ve worked in the A/V world almost two decades now and only been burned when I was stupid and didn’t get those signatures. 
"I worked at an older place with a woman who was fairly high up.  Every morning she would print out her emails, write out her responses long hand, type up her long hand reply, print it out, and then send it as a reply."
"An employee who lacked the imagination, initiative and plain old-fashioned common sense to wonder if there was a command for doing this simple but time-consuming task automatically is probably not worth keeping even if they manage to actually pass an ""Excel for people who've been living under a rock since the Unix Epoch"" course. We were learning this stuff in the regional equivalent of *eighth grade* when I was in school. (To the detriment of anything that this sub would recognise as ""IT"", in fact, but that's a rant for another venue.)"
"1) this has been the whole reason for existence for spreadsheets since Visicalc in 1979 - otherwise, you could just use a text editor if you’re doing all the math by hand.

2) I had a similar situation, with not as fun of a result (actually - non result) - 

Worked at a defense contractor while i was in college - just completing the whole ‘compiler / disassembler’ class - at work saw a dude with a 3” binder of printed out HEXADECIMAL. He was hand-disassembling the hex code into assembly, like a monk copying bibles, and apparently, taking just as long. (at the 18 month mark)

Me: you’re doing this by hand - so - you just have the paper print out?

old dude: oh, no - we have the EEPROM with the code on it in the lab, i printed this out from a dump.

Me: any reason you couldn’t just spend a day writing a disassembler for the processor chip (8 bit), and then get all this disassembled and printed out in an hour?

Him: [blink]

later I discovered the term ‘job security in aerospace’."
"I once worked for an executive who has his secretary print out emails and put them in his inbox (meaning a physical box on his desk that said “in” on it), then after he read them he would call his secretary into his office and dictate his reply, while she took notes in short hand, then she’d go to her desk and write it up, then print it out and bring it to him to read, and he’d read it and mark it up with a red pen and give it back, then she’d make the edits and bring it back, the he’d review again, etc etc, over and over again until he gave the ok and she could finally send it out.

The number of man-hours required to send ONE email was to damn high.  My incredulous facial expression as this process was explained to me got me on that executive’s shit-list for quite a while."
"Kudos for putting up with that load of crap, OP. Polish up the resumé &amp; look for a position where your experience &amp; skills will be appreciated. Good luck!"

Now it does
"Sad indeed.  Best of luck to her, and I hope you and she go on to a rewarding business relationship."
You're a good dude Unkk. This warmed my cold dead sysadmin heart.
"if we did that, my office alone could power a small city..."
It’s my personal phone which is what is fucked up. My work phone is off. 
"&gt;ound someone doing something that monotonous without quickly Googling ""how to make Excel calculate sums."" I will go through HOURS of research to avoid horrid tasks like that.

Now try imagining that you couldn't even fathom the possibility of Excel being able to do that."
The US and the UK: two countries separated by a common language.
"I told her mom that it was perfectly all right.  Her daughter was only 5 so helping her was easy. 
I met my daughters when they were 3 and 5 and adopted them when they were old enough to agree to it.  I was used to helping them with their homework.  

My wife and Math had a bad relationship in high school and its awkward when ever they get back together."
I would have laughed and shaken my head at the first call. The second would have gotten forwarded straight to HR. Malpractice insurance will only get you so far.
You mean you don't have work's telephone number blocked on your personal mobile?
"Might have gotten confused? Both area codes are local, but for landlines they typically also indicate a geographic region. So if the old fellow got a cell phone and then moved, he might have assumed his area code did too (since it likely would have if he'd been moving with a landline). So (I'm assuming) someone likely told him that his phone number was still the same, but he tacked the area code on to the front because well, he moved, so now he has the new area code, right?"
No need to CC the FBI. If they need to see it they'll access your copy.
"ah. that place didnt even have an IT department. they had 3 early 90's model IBM systems. I just happened to know how to do mail merge in Word Perfect, and how to do that with envelopes.  I was just a temp worker - filling in for a full time employee. and finished her job in about  6 hours. "

*sigh* users.
"I've gotten that look, and sent that look.

I wonder what the psychology of it is though? When you think about it a fix is a fix. We get all territorial over these things for nothing after we've thought about it for awhile."
These kind of people are the sole reason we haven't all quit our jobs yet. It's just a pity they're so rare. 
"Exactly this. 

I won't ever hold it against a user if they ask me questions, or don't know what's up - asking me if Excel can do sums is totally okay. 

What's *not* okay is deciding to spend *two days* adding stuff manually instead of asking or googling to see if there's a better way. "
The Internet can't breathe underwater everyone knows that.
"True, but cuts no ice with HR or other types.

"These types of users can be classified as revenue raising clients. 

I would have been tempted to send the onsite tech and charged them and let the bosses over there sort it out. 

Although you made the right call in forwarding to your boss. 

I would've liked to be a fly on the wall of that particular meeting though. "
"Ouch. On the flip side, that kind of stress doesn't excuse the dude's erratic behavior, but it does explain it somewhat. Hope he's ready to get taken to the cleaners in court over sabotaging that contract. Thanks for the closure to the story."
