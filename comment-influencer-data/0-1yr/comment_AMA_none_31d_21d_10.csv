I'm sad for you but I hope you find reason to smile again.
Really? I feel like crab is one of those things I can never “overeat” it’s actually one of my favorite things to eat now because it’s so filling my so light.

What was her reasoning for blaming you?
"I hate and do not support their lifestyle, but I have nothing against them personally and if I meet one, ill just treat them like anyone else."
"Gotcha. I'm assuming because your bill won't be much, if anything at all. 

Are you in a big hospital? Is it far from your home? How does your family feel about your diagnosis? Are you going to have a long treatment path?"
Nah I agree with that opinion to much shit is what I've gone through to not agree with that

Are you receiving care in the US?
Not yet but we will see

Interesting
Have you thought about what you're going to do after you leave the army?
"Why is family different from other ppl? Do you have empathy for family or you imagine that you should care about a steady environment of ppl that you have used to? 
Have you ever imagined hurting ppl? Is anything stoping you? 
Was something in your life that made you a psychopath or you where born this way?have you ever felt anger ? Is sex important to you? 
Does watching animals getting hurt make you uncomfortable and why? 
Have you ever been close to empathizing to someone? And if yes how was it?
And lastly if you had the chance to be able to empathize ,would you like to change or remain as you are?"
nope
How do you feel about gays ?
Yes
"yeah, i found that out. this one lets anybody tell lies to get attention."
"Not OP, but also Russian. Yes, vodka is a popular beverage, and a lot of people drink every Friday after work. I don't have a lot of stats, but Russia has a high consumption of alcohol.

And yes, a lot of people are driving carelessly. Driving 5-10 km/h higher than speed limit is basically the norm, just as driving during the first couple of seconds of the red light, and I hear a lot of reports of drinking and driving. Again, don't have any statistics, but that's from my experience. Also, roads are really bad here. Main roads are maintained relatively well, but smaller roads can be in terrible condition for years, and the government does little to fix them. There is, for example, a hole in Novosibirsk that has its own twitter account, and this hole is 3 years old..."
"Twice, but technically 3 times."

"How did it happen? Who suggested it?

What positions were adopted? And what felt best to you?

"I know my sister has a sex life. Doesn’t mean i want to see her naked or watch her have sex.

I saw your other comment about how you don’t care if anyone sees your bits and that’s fine, you do you. Having pictures like that floating around can cause not only embarrassment but it can also affect employment chances since employers nowadays like to search your name on the internet to get background info."

Do you 2 live in Alabama or anyplace near it?
What's his mos
That sounds like fun
Hooligan is amazing!  Only had it once but yeah that stuff is brutal.  My kinda stuff.
What about your background is interesting?
"Good question. Using 18mg liquid it took about three or four weeks for the desire for a cigarette to go away. It was not comfortable. It was not fun.

However it was far better than many times I tried to stop cold turkey. Stop smoking drugs did not work for me. 

I consider myself ""morbidly addicted"" to nicotine- I used cigarettes for 30 years. Which is probably why I was not able to separate from the nicotine. Although there are other chemicals in tobacco that are addictive or psychoactive so I only went through a partial withdrawal."
Why you sad boi
Don't you speak ill of the flame-shirted tip froster or be banished from the kingom of flavor.
hungry and gay
How does your family feel about it?
"Mold on bleu cheese is harmless.  It's part of the fun!

Plant based cheese has yet to impress me.  It just doesn't have the right flavor or texture yet.  

Low sodium cheeses can be made from the get go.  Once the salt is dissolved in the cheese, it can't be removed."

I've only been to a few WF but I've heard their cheese selection is very good.

Why did you decide to start the taper? 1.5 MG of Xanax isn't high enough to cause impairment.
 ...but thigh highs are my demise?
I’m a guy who’s mother want me to learn how to cook basic meals so can you tell me the recipie please
Second cousins.
"Yes!! I could use a permanent vacation. 

I enjoy it. Been doing it for 5 years or so. And I have started teaching my friends how. 

I have heard of breaking bad. Never saw it. I very much enjoy 'the good place' , and Lucifer. But my favorites change like the weather.

I have not heard of the author or the book. I prefer horror. Anything Stephen King or Howard Phillips Lovecraft. 

Never heard of the movie either... Hmm. Anything classic 80s. Goonies, princess bride, back to the Future, Ghostbusters, trading places.

Piercings or tattoos?"
"Chechnya is another thing.
But yeah, this is hella terrifying.

Even THOUGH Chechnya’s president is a thug too - he is actually Putin’s friend."
Do you believe in Bigfoot?
"Always wondered. Anyways, have a great day from Michigan."
"We was together for almost 4 years now and we have never had a fight or anything, she wasn’t gonna cheat, i wasn’t gonna cheat and never none of us would ever have. We met through one of her friends (an ”ex” who was unfaithful)"
Hell yeah!
"Is your only NSFW post your midget torture one?

"It depends on which family member. My immediate family support us, and our choice to have children but they call him cousin daddy. My extended family didn’t know until we told his mother I was pregnant. It’s been about three years now so, we are strong and just getting stronger."
"I don't really eat cheese, so who am I to disagree?"
"Cotija, Oaxaca, or Fresco?"
"Not really. We natives can be kinda prideful to a fault. What everyone sees as a lose to a war with the french, we see as a defense from the french that lasted TWELVE years. We might have lost, eventually, but we put up one hell of a fight. 

In today's day and age, it's not so bad but back when the reservations were first started, their ""let us help you savages"" was pretty brutal. Thankfully we're not thought of as stupid barbarians anymore. 

That's a really complex idea to think about. The arrival of the Europeans really turned the Americas on their heads. I would like to think that it would be similar to Africa but some native tribes were pretty darn advanced. So I can't imagine they wouldn't be somehow in the midway point between what Africa is now and what America is now. But honestly, it's really hard to say."
my mom and sister had suspicions of which were based on very flimsy evidence that just happened to be true. My dad was completely cueless though lol.
"I don't mean to take over, but I just moved to Connecticut from living nearby [Nordic Creamery](https://www.nordiccreamery.com/) and I am always bummed when I don't see any in stores here. Probably too much expense."
"Sure you can, try harder."
"Yeah my school is all about being employable right out of high school so I feel like I do have real-world job skills especially since I'm AutoCAD certified. I personally have no idea what I want to do but I will be going to college unlike a lot of my friends who were in Construction, HVAC, etc and are going straight into the workforce. My school is so big on the real world that architecture class was the most stressful thing ever... it made me not want to pursue architecture anymore. A lot of my friends got jobs at architecture/engineering firms senior year as part of the co-op program and they're gonna continue their co-op job as they go to college for architecture."
Wait so your not an 16 y/o homeless person? I can't belive ScammerMan102 lied to me :o
"Hm. 

Probably when I had a car accident, and me and the man had a beer on the side of the road waiting for insurance. I was underage at this point, god bless Australia."

"I was on 1.5mg Xanax for 3 years.. when I started my taper I switched from 1.5mg Xanax to 20mg Valium. I would take the Valium half in the morning and half at night. I decreased my dose by 2.5mg every month. When I got to around 10mg I was feeling bad and stayed on that dose for 3 months as I didn’t want to increase my dose again. I carried on decreasing my dose by 2.5mg until I reached 2.5mg and then I decreased it to 1.25 after a month and then I jumper. The taper took me about a year. Weirdly enough I was feeling the most lethargic and had beach aches at 2.5/1.25mg and I was so scared of jumping. But the night I skipped my 1.25mh dose the next day I felt so clear headed like it was euphoric. I stoped taking it and just started feeling better and better as I’ve been off benzodiazepines for nearly a year now. During my taper I thought I was literally going insane with all my thoughts, body aches, headaches, neck aches, light sensitivity, depression, anxiety, brain zaps... but nigga we made it!! 😭"
"There is no way Russian government *cough*Putin*cough* will ever allow any mass protests. He will shut them down before they even start. I personally believe that’s why Russia got so involved in Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia were brother countries. So if Russian people see that Ukraine starts living better when they go with Europe, they will turn to Putin and be like umm excuse me but you were saying West sucks and look at our bro Ukraine over there. They started living so much better with them"
dsfsd
I started the taper because I was sick of the withdrawal symptoms. 1.5mh daily is MORE than high enough for impairment as that’s a high dose for anxiety which I was taking it for. Other people who take 2mg+ and binging on 6mg are either suicidal or just feeding their addiction to a much higher extent
Yeet yourself
I don’t remember I remember an Irish one from my step grandma don’t remember the words exactly
"I'm a fan of bleu cheese, who among the larger manufacturers do you believe makes the best bleu?

(I'd love to try artisan, small/private maker level stuff, but I'm poor so I have to make do with HEB's 8 different bleu cheeses)"
Lol... I...just....*can't*....
Any specific cheeses you had that for?
I am lactose intolerant. Is it true I can have certain cheeses? Thoughts on non-cheese like Daiya?
Although I can't say I'm too much of a fan of being eaten alive slowly
plot twist: i am your sibling.
Are you supposed to eat the wax that covers the cheese itself?
I was really only half kidding. Lol
"Do you guys realize us non lazy eye people don't know whY eye to look at then we talk to you?

What eye should I look at? I normally just stare at the 4head just above the eyes"

"On Bumble (the dating app), women have to write the first message. Then, guys can reply. Tinder? Either can say hello first. It wasn't sleazy hook-up chat. I was kind. Polite. But we both knew that it was about me traveling, and their physical wants / needs."
"Ah ok. thanks for the info.  How do you feel it's helped, hindered, or changed your behaviors?  Any ... side effects ... that people don't like to talk about?"
Are you white?
I see you're from the Mile High City! What Denver cheese shops or restaurants should I check out?
Jesus Christ. Screw all that. I had a fight break out between these guys because one made fun of the other for not graduating high school as well as mocking his favorite nba team. All I knew was there was a noise complaint. So when I get down there these guys are about to start fist fighting and their friends are asking me to break it up. I was like “wtf am I supposed to do?!” So I just kept walking and called the police. But apparently they calmed down before the cops arrived. Next day room was trashed. Paintings knocked off walls and stuff. At least they don’t know me or care to know me. Stay safe!!
"Well, I don't think it's anything dangerous or else they would evacuate everyone. After all, nowadays many people have radiation detectors. Thanks!"
Why am I talking to you?

"Having Bipolar is an exhausting rollercoaster.  There are times when your mood is as elevated as possible (mania/manic episodes) or as depressed as possible.  For the record ""as elevated as possible"" is far more serious than merely being in a good mood and ""as depressed as possible"" is far lower than 'ordinary' depression.  Bipolar depression is at times akin to human hibernation.  You can sleep for literally 3 days straight.  You're at times too low to even be suicidal.  When manic, though your behavior comes off a loony, it's merely that your mood is elevated to the point where nothing is off the table, if you will.  Your consequence and foresight switches get bypassed.  Hence, spending money you don't have impulsively to the point of being overdrawn by $1,000.  You'll stay up for 3 days and still have energy.  You'll think of starting a million projects at once, hook up with a stranger out of state that you met online, give your belongings to strangers, etc.  It can look like mismanaging, irresponsibility and such but in the moment you can't stop it.  It's not until we come down from an episode that we look at the damage and are dismayed at what took place.  When manic, some people's brains get so overloaded that we dissociate or have psychotic breaks.  Dissociation feels like a dream and like you're on autopilot.  Imagine daydreaming times a million.  I have never experienced psychosis though, so I've never thought I was God or anything.  Typically the mental and physical exhaustion of being as revved up as can be during mania will inevitably lead right into the Bipolar crash, followed by a depressive episode.  Bipolar and substance use issues tend to go hand in hand.  We're not trying to be immoral or anything but we're subconsciously trying to manage our moods by taking in what brings us down a bit or up a bit.  We are not psychopathic or sociopathic.  We don't murder people.  We don't have multiple personalities, etc.  We are not dangerous and frankly, we're irked that media portrays us as such.  Though yes, during our manic episodes we can be wreak havoc on our own lives.  Our mood fluctuations make it remarkably difficult to hold down a job, hence being allowed to claim Social Security Disability if Bipolar.  We can't handle the job stress that others take for granted.  It spirals us back and forth between manic and depressed to the point where we're mentally and physically exhausted.  We inevitably have to resign very shortly after trying a new position.  People with Bipolar tend to have a very messy resume and last between 2 weeks to 2 years, typically.  We feel like the black sheep of society and are often misunderstood and stigmatized.  To make matters worse, though medication can help a lot, your mood can still sway a bit too much in one direction or the other, simply due to things in life that are unavoidable.  Excess stress without enough downtime causes us to spiral but you can't help if someone close to you unexpectedly passes away or your neighbors were too loud so you didn't get enough sleep.  You can't prevent the change of season and so on.  This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  Here's a great example.... due to my sister unexpectedly being rushed to the hospital, I'm sleep deprived and am posting on Reddit at 4AM while chain smoking and droning on.  Though it takes years to learn to self identify, I can tell that my lack of sleep and being overstressed has me in a hypomanic state, a level below full blown mania.  I quite possibly may need a psychiatric hospital soon if I don't get my sleep/wake schedule back on track and begin to decompress with adequate downtime.  Many things others take for granted, we can't.  We need at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  We can't skip meals.  We need to be diligent about structure and routine.  We can't isolate too much and risk spiraling into depression but we can't overdo things either and risk triggering mania.  It's a very difficult illness to manage and it takes a lot of determination and strength to go on.  People with Bipolar should hardly be viewed in a negative light but much rather the other way around, if you really think about it, lol"
"Appreciate it man. I’m dialed in, it’s been such a long processes."
Aww thanks mom. I didn't know moms used reddit I thought it was just kids. You're the best.

"This is more the creepiest thing, but:

I had to cover second shift for someone, and then take a Lyft home (only 1 car, and the kids dont need to be woken up at 11pm to pick me up from work). When I get back at 630 the next morning the Night Auditor tells me that he had to have the police remove 2 people from a room upstairs because of drugs domestic abuse, but the third person with them was not removed, as he claimed that he had nothing to do with it, and the cops were ""sounds legit"".

Third Guy was my Lyft driver the night before. 

Third Guy wanted me to extend the reservation a couple of nights (i assume so he could try to get his buddy out of jail), but the reservation was not in his name. I told him there was nothing that I could, that the hotel was booked, and he had to be out by checkout that morning. 

Then the guests that initially reported the domestic disturbance came downstairs an hour and a half later. I apologized for the issues, gave them a discount, and asked them what happened the night before.

According to them Third Guy getting back to the room was the catalyst to the issues the night before, and was screaming and swearing and throwing things upstairs right at that moment.

I call PD again and ask dispatch to come remove him, and tell Housekeeping to steer clear until I give the okay.

When the cops show up they come to the desk to tell me that Third Guy Definitely Did NOT Have Anything To Do With Disturbance Last Night. 
I said I didnt care and that I just wanted him out, he was trashing the room now.
Cops insist Third Guy Is Not Being Arrested, He Did Nothing Illegal.
I say I dont give a damn, get him off my property now.
Cops say This Has Nothing To Do With Last Night? Okay, Third Guy Is Just Getting His Things Now.

Then I realize that Third Guy is a Lyft Driver, knows where I live, and could potentially be selected to pick me up from work again.

Had to contact Lyft, and explain the situation. Put Third Guy on our Do Not Rent List, and I was worried for a couple weeks that Third Guy might show up to my apartment and try to confront me."
"I won’t say the exact amount, but I was making about 8k-10k per month. There’s a seasonal effect, but considering everything, then I’d say that estimate is pretty solid. When I got “caught” I amazingly didn’t have to do any jail time since I was young at the time, but I did have to comply with an agent and turn in basically everything I used to produce them."
"From reading these comments I saw you live in Washington state and I’ve gotta say... I don’t blame you for wanting to stay up 5 straight days. This place is boring, but what do you usually do for “fun” here?"
"&gt;By ""fear of the consequences of his overthrow"" do you mean fear of not being a dictatorship or fear of not being lead by Putin?

First, but not only. Lenin and Stalin, and Yeltsin all fucked up about democracy and a good life. It ended with that shit.

Therefore, let Putin be better, I say once again the standard of living in Russia is higher than you think here. Because at reddit they try to do only the negative side of Russia.

Therefore, all talk of revolution, the overthrow of power. This is nonsense idiots who do not understand anything in life. Like the author of the post.

Which was directly asked about the return of Crimea to Ukraine. This idiot was not ready for him, ahah. Therefore, ordinary people will not go for such. Putin will calmly correct until the end of his presidency. Yes, you can say that this bastard deliberately brought us into this position. But why should I go after idiots who do not even know how to get out of it?

All they say is so similar to the nonsense of the Communists in 1917, or the lies of the former Communists in 1991."

Oh god yes. Managers got a bonus if the store made quota on roundup. Also after the whole incident with the ceo of The land of Lincoln Goodwills we were told not to talk about it or we would get a verbal warning. Managers treated their employees like they were stupid or  unimportant. most of them didn’t give a shit about their customers. All they cared about was the money.
"If I’m being 100 honest, I don’t want to. After I came off then I felt like a completely different person. I found parts of my personality so far gone I barely remembered.

I have accepting that I will be depressed for the rest of my life because the singular medicine that actually helped without side effects my doctor took me off or without reason. If I die of suicide, oh well."

Ummm really? You trust these people? They are quite literally enslaving your mind. They have taught you how to think, how to behave, how to vote and how to give half of your pay check away. And you happily do it. Blind obedience. 

The younger generation has one of the highest amounts of self awareness. What?! These people are the epitome of unaware. They are consumed by emotion and fear. Self awareness is to practice mindfulness. To believe people are born with this is simply not true. 

More people seeking mental health services than ever before.. a testament to how sick the millennials really are. And can we agree this is directly related to their unstable parents? Thank goodness for more and more social services popping up. However I doubt a bandaid will help."

I have a Stag AR15 love that rifle. Just checked out Extar and that fits the bill. Just wanting something to plink with that doesn't break the bank for ammo. Thanks.

"They're all from the same family of cheeses: Grana.  Made in similar ways.  The difference is the types of animals used to make them and where they're from.  Cheese has terroir just like wine.

Romano is typically a Sheeps Milk cheese (Pecorino), Asiago isn't aged for as long as Parmesan (usually less than a year) and Parmesano Reggiano is a legal term for cheese made from a certain type of cow in a certain region of Italy and produced in a very specific way.  It's a DOP cheese which is essentially a trademark and cheese needs to be made to very stringent standards to qualify."

"Long aging does not a great cheddar make.  Buy an expensive 2 year from Neals Yard and that should hit the spot.  Cabot's higher-end line is also very good.

"In the end It's about values, of course no one likes to loose money, but a lot of things are more important than money though."
"I honestly loved it! It's a county school so I got to meet a lot of different people and my school was so diverse that white people were actually the minority (\~80% of students were black, hispanic, middle eastern, asian, or mixed). My parents wanted me to go because it has better education than my district high school and I wanted to go because I used to really want to be an architect and it was the norm to apply. 

My graduating class was about 790 kids. Each class starts out with roughly 1000 kids. If you fail 3 classes in one year or fail one year of your major class (we call them shop classes), you get sent back to district (we call it RTD for ""return to district""). However, starting the class of 2022, there are about 1300 kids in each class because of our new STEM research majors (Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Life Sciences) which are different from our original stem majors (Computer Science and Engineering). So the student body is roughly 4,000 kids I would say..."

Ok
What kinds of mental health issues are you going to focus on?
how to watch nfl free
I really like cheese with sweet stuff.  Chocolate especially.  Yet Reeses constantly shoots down my written suggestions for Stilton Cups.
What makes you think that you've found the one?
"If I have friends over, what kind of cheese should I be serving with wine. Like what exactly is fancy cheese? BTW my favorite so far in life is colby jack."
"I love Cantal for a grilled cheese, mild and melty."
Is it good?
Which country makes the best cheese?
"If your doctor says your wax levels are low, then yes."
Thankyou for your candour.  The clarity of thought which you display here makes it abundantly clear that you are far from a stupid barbarian!
"Be really nice to everyone who works there. Like make a great impression with the managers, desk agents, and dont leave your room trashed. Then next time you're there you can ask nicely if its possible.

If guests are nice to me, and not super needy I will do anything I can for them"
"i just read your username 

r/usernamechecksout"
Anything wbu
"You can have values and self-interest at the same time, my friend.

The answer to your original question is yes."
"Dangerous words. You may have chosen your job, but most of sex workers of the world haven't; they've been forced into it."
I don't have to answer when you're asking questions in bad faith. Go meme someone else.
"Any cheese aged longer than a few months should have very little, if any, lactose.  You might want to try a firm goats or sheeps milk cheese."
how to watch
Have you ever lost a game of tic tac toe to a child?
"I won’t say the exact amount, but I was making about $8k-$10k per month. There is a seasonal effect but considering everything then I would say that estimate is pretty solid. When I got “caught” I amazingly didn’t have to do any jail time, only because (I’m assuming) that I was young at the time and didn’t have any ill intents. I did have to comply with the agents and turn in every single thing that I used to produce them."
"Ti ruski my ass, I can't believe how many People believed this moron."
"I was fired, it's not nice, but it worked out for the best. Do you have prospects for a new job?"
Are you Alex James?
Are you scared the white kid is going to snap?
"Did you ever taste ""Casu Marzu""? It's a spoiled pecorino cheese from Italy (famous because you eat it with living maggots on it)"
What does one need to do to become a certified cheese expert? how can you be an expert on cheese and why do you need to be certified?
Why do you use 'they' instead of 'her'?
"So I’m better off reading Canadian textbooks? And yes, England throughout history has been oppressive. Their oppression of the Americas is the foundation of the Bill of Rights. Also, their oppression of India led directly to Gandhi rising to power and leading a nonviolent rebellion with the goal of become their own sovereign nation."
Fucking animals. Christ that's disgusting
No!
"I would try to establish peace, get Crimea  to Ukraine and everything else.
Why do you need to be so aggressive, you dipshit?"
Are you able to recall any smell vividly?
"I had an ongoing conflict with my manager, who is an owner, and it went south recently. He found out I have been complaining about him last week from some kind of gossip, started a witch hunt by calling everyone I work with and asking what I said about him."
"I realise I didn't quite answer your question with the first one, so let me try to explain it in depth.
Do you know that feeling of watching a show which has been there your entire life, but then suddenly the creator died and someone new has to fill in the position of that person. Now there is a new season and you watch it but it feels like something is missing... Something is off. The characters are still the same, the jokes are of the same sort as before but something is just... Off.

I fear that after Endgame, I will have the same thing happen to the Marvel for me. I don't want the story to end like this, I want to keep seeing Stan Lee Cameos but that won't happen anymore (RIP Stan Lee, we are thankful for what you created).

I just don't want the see the peak of something I love and then the downfall afterwards."
"i work with my father's real estate company,"
What is the process to make a fake ID? Do you need specialized equipment.
What is the best sort of cheese
Fucked any sheep?
What's your occupation now?
"I’ve of course thought about it but never considered doing it. There’s a big difference between making id’s so college kids can go to bars, and for adults that are using identification to gain employment illegally, or for god know what other bad reasons. I was always strict with who I made them for and would do my own version of a background check."
how much money did you make?
"VPN is blocked here aswell you, you have to find a niche one that they havent blocked yet we get this when we try to visit a ""sinful"" site  [https://imgur.com/a/FarDA1p](https://imgur.com/a/FarDA1p)"
I've been told those are the best African men.
"We usually don't use radar guns on stretches of unlimited speed, because... why would you use them? But since normal patrol cars mostly don't go over 250, and he was much faster, my guess was 320 (like 250, 320 is usually one of the standard speeds where manufacturers limit cars)"
What is your favourite Western movie or tv series?
world most boring job?
I was a devout Christian growing up but left the religion recently. Did you grow up in your faith or find it?
"Had those feelings too bro, they don't last. High school sucks but that's life"
This is the only time that would seem slow for a car
"Do you fear walking around outside at night? I used to live in Cape Town, and at the time I was told it wasn't safe to leave my neighbourhood past dark"
Thanks for uploading the games to the site! Only thing I have noticed is that you forgot to mention that Minecraft is on the Nintendo switch
Where is your favourite place to travel to?
Are you vegan?
People who truly wanted to end the tyrannical government would unite and form a militia. It would be expensive but the average person could get war grade gun.
Do you drive?
No that's a Christmas song
Yes I am
"Also, given the reliance on oil profits, Saudi needs to find a new source of revenue. I've heard that they are aiming for tourism but obviously few women or men want to go to a dry country where women are also forced to be fully covered. Are thing loosening up over there culturally in order to make way for new revenue streams?"
Cote de'Azure
"I really do hate not hanging out with friends, for example traveling to their houses because some from my school love far away. I then will have to explain to them why I won’t be able to go to stay over, but only few no about my anxiety so sometimes I have to make up excuses"
ways to have fun in world most boring job?
Why are you so selfish?
That's too bad
Why is this brave and selfless? You don't even know what happened?
That doesn't clarify much Father.
*cough* Bethesda
"Is there any conceivable justification for using cheese puns, or do those type of people always deserve to die?"
"That he's a traitor, but feel bad for his wife and kids"
No thanks I don't want a butt dumpster fire vegimite sandwiches
"Chat me up, crybaby! X"
Your posts are so bullshit.
Is Velveeta cheese? And why is it your favorite?
i readed shitting instead of sitting
"My friend tim had a threesome with his brother and cousin susan.  Are you tim's brother, Shane?"
"Weird, I always thought that was like a common bucket list item"
European geographical indications are a form of intellectual property protection. They're designed to protect certain regionally important products and the processes behind them. Example being Parmigiano-Reggiano can only be called that if they are made in specific Italian regions and only if they follow certain processes.
Amen
"1. I have cleaning chores to do, also watch ani e on my tablet.

2. Yes, I have other tasks to accomplish throughout the night besides just helping customers and one guy in particular had a large problem with the extra 30 seconds I took to help him and he decided that the best way to handle this would me to threaten to kick my ass.

3. No not really."
I love me a good extra sharp cheddar.
And when they all shrug and go “that’s how you make-a da pizza pieeeee!”
"Dont force anything, have fun, dont make it weird"
"Everytime I go in for a hug with my mum she pushes me away, tf's wrong with me man"
How can you be so sure of your sexuality at such a young age? Have you been in a relationship with both genders?
"What is, in your professional opinion, the best tasting cheese?"
"I'm probably doing a good thing by not donating. Black Snake Moan is good for no one.

I haven't done the pins yet. I'm waiting for the next person to cut me off while driving. I'll pin it and toss it at the car. 

Stickers got stuck on a notebook and who knows where that went. 

Next time I go I eyed a crappy jewelery machine and might get a new bracelet. Why not I guess."
"Remeber this was written after an armed rebellion, and the intent of this is to protect the people from a tyrannical government they had just escaped. This is why I think the people should be well equipped to deal with the American government."
"I sometimes make my own mozzarella at home, but for whatever reason there are times that I can't get the curds to coagulate. I think my problem is the rennet. I use Junket tablets because that's what my local store keeps in stock. Do you have any suggestions on a better rennet I could be using?"
Thank you for this. I needed that.
No I wouldn’t do that. I’m not like that so judging me on that category is not fair on my part.
Do you like cantaloupe?
"I just finished oatmeal pancakes, rice ,beans now I have to cook some chicken 😫"
"How can an underage person hypothetically even receive cigarettes?

(Don't worry, I've never smoked in my life and don't plan to. This is purely for curiosity.)"
The Ashton manual from a British lady doctor is excellent.
"No, but I'm sure the girls over at gone wild do."
"Ã) Fun fact: I've never done drugs but everyone assumes I have. 

b) I make myself laugh all the time and feel so dumb afterwards. It's mostly while I'm talking to someone and I'm being absurd trying to get a rise out of them and they start giving this ""...and here he goes..."" face and so I just get ridiculous and end up laughing at my own stupidity.

III) Why thank you. And they are pretty similar. Trying to figure out just what to say to a specific group of people to get the desired effect from them without saying something that'll get you fired. Plus you passed the bar exam, I just try to pass the bar."
"I send you my condolences.

I also realize this isn't a question."
"Define ""criminal""?

Like, drug dealer? Yes.

Prostitute? Yes.

Abusers who I've had to call the police on because they were abusing their girlfriends/wives in my hotel? Yes.

Have you ever had someone check in that was *definitely* a criminal?
Aight
"Thank you so much! Glad to hear i actually have someone like a idea of mine XD. It's still in the early stages at the moment. Writing scripts, coming up with names, getting co hosts that sorta thing. But it will be happening!"
If you want to make an amazing expensive pizza? Straight up fresh buffalo mozzarella.  It’s expensive but slice that up into little coins and place all over (like ALL OVER) the pizza.  Then hit it with some real Parmesan grated off of a block before it goes in the oven and again after it comes out.  Get involved with that.
Very 10/10 would do again 12/10 reccomend
You still use 18mg?

New carpet smell all the time!! Lucky nostrils.
"Nono not making video games. Just videos.sometimes stop motion,sometimes with a drawing tablet"
"I've seen articles about what happens in your body when you quit smoking, like within 1 day x happens and within 1 week y happens etc.  Have you been feeling better physically, aside from withdrawal?"
"Could be better, could be worse. I percieve the world normally, but with more stress and anxiety. I try to take some things people throw at me as advice (even if it isn't really). But to be honest, i dont really know how EXACTLY i percieve the world. I think everyone has a different point of view"
Can you teach me some Portuguese swears?
"for hysteria they would lock a woman up and use a vibrator on her . crazy shit , i don\`t remeber the era."
Which shootings

"Do you believe in god, and if so why do you think he seems to hate you?"
Lol thank you :)
How many times a year do you go?
DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!

I very much agree.
"Well idk about ''superior'', I just prefer to be among other white people for several reasons. I'm American, yes. I dislike dark skinned people in general, Africans in particular."
"To ligado, vc ta em qual ano (ou já ta na facul)?"
De nada 👍
"Not a question, but no you haven't. At 16 years old, there is no way you can know who you will want to be with in five years, let alone 30. Be with that person as long as it works and move on when it's necessary."
"I also lean on the aspergers side. Especially with being social, AKA my lack of"
"I appreciate it. And I hope you are doing well,  I grew up in a household that was mainly Christian based values but it was never pressed on me. I’ve gone to church a handful of times but never found what most people look for. I do irritate people when I say I do believe in a god but also evolution so it does make for some interesting dialogue and conversations."
"In all honestly, it makes me feel like shit. I have cravings all the time and just want a cig. I can’t sleep as good and always want one. This is so far anyways, heard it gets easier and better."
"Eh, religion has always been more personal to me. If what you believe fulfills you, that’s exactly what it should do.

I suppose I’d consider myself more agnostic because I’m not abhorrently opposed to there being something else, but I just don’t find that I am missing anything.

My parents are very religious, but for the wrong reasons. They are religious simply because they’re afraid of a hell. 

If they’re irritated it’s likely because they aren’t fulfilled by what they believe and feel that you, too, should be unfulfilled."
I want a body
"Quick warning. It's REALLY LONG and the fandom is considered one of the worst (well, in 2012)"
Mainstream TV channels make USA look like an enemy. That's why quite a large part of the population thinks the same and I don't share this opinion.
How much does it weigh?
"i like america’s immigration policy, surprisingly. i understand trump has a lot of haters but i don’t think all the criticism he gets is true. for example, building the wall to separate america from mexico. i genuinely have no clue why that stirs up so much calamity. do people want mexicans hopping the border? it is very well known that this occurs a lot and i actually know of people in the california area who knows for a fact this has happened. 

psychological impact, surprisingly, hasn’t been so potent. if anything, i’d say it’s mostly humbling. you see how poor you are and back home and how dangerous things are and wish to come to america for a better life. however, since moving to america i’ve noticed there are different kinds of struggles (obviously not to the degree of back home, but you get it). people here are much more arrogant and depressed and it actually makes me miss home. how have i been coping? just taking it one day at a time"
"S(he) must suck your penis very well, eh?"
"That’s good for you, really. As someone who is an Atheist that’s never had any major tragedy (outside of the normal human condition), I have great respond for people who keep/find faith through adversity."
I used too feel bad about it. But i've finally just stopped caring about people's made up ideas about me. So i've accepted it at this point.
"I work wholesale and I'm starting to get tired of the grind sales takes. What keeps you motivated/do you get a base salary or is it all commission based? '
