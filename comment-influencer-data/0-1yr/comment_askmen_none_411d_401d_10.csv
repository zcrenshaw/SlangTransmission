"Good shit, no you’re not crazy."
"The fact that she was late is forgivable, things happen. The fact that she told you that you're in the wrong for not accepting her bad habit is a huge red flag."
  I just cancel the date and leave it to her to reschedule. If she truly is interested she’ll jump on the chance to make it right. Value your time.
I don't drive so I have to sing really loudly on my bicycle. Granted it has not worked yet but tomorrow is another day??

"""You don't understand, I'm disrespectful to everyone's time, not just yours, lol!""

Yeah, you did the right thing."
I'd be fucking thrilled.
"Just don't sign up at the priest's house, simple"
"Yeah, just remember, if you are dating to find a life partner, people generally act better when they are dating than when they are married/have been in a relationship for a while. If it bothers you that she acted like this then imagine further down the road in the relationship when she expects you to wait for 3 or 4 hours. Good call canceling. "
Thanks.
"I bought a high end Italian car once.  I did it because I wanted it, but every dude I knew said ""omg you are going to get SO much pussy!""

You know who looked at me as I drove by?  Dudes.  100% dudes.  Girls, I presume, thought I was trying too hard.  I actually ended up hiding the thing on rare occasions I got dates.  The car was fun but I got zero pussy out of it."
"Doesn't matter who owns the house, living with your mother will greatly impact your sex life"
"I was married.  We had a really nice wedding.  The place was gorgeous and there's no denying my wife had good taste in all the wedding things (the touches were really great... it would have been hard to design a better wedding).  It was probably the nicest wedding I've ever been to.

We were middle class or upper-middle class but her sister made more money than my wife and her fiancee made more money than I did so they booked the premier wedding venue in our city.  When my wife found out, she cried her eyes out (the kind of crying where you can barely breathe) and said ""Everyone is going to see the pictures, how am I supposed to compete with that?""  And she never backed down from that position despite our arguments.  When I told her not everything is a competition, she laughed in my face.

Looking back, this mentality is part of the reason wedding planning was so hard between us.  I told her I'd marry her in a gas station if I had to - I thought we were planning our day but apparently she was trying to win a competition.  I don't know if she hid it really well or I was just too dumb to figure it out.

This issue was particularly heartbreaking for me and was one of a million reasons we got divorced.  We got married over 2 years ago and thinking about this still hurts.  I loved her so much but I couldn't buy a bigger house and take bigger trips and buy nicer cars just to show the pictures to everyone online - something she expressed she wanted AFTER we got married.

EDIT:  Wow, I'm not sure what to say.  Thank you all for your kind and supportive replies."
"I married a girl who was always late. 

Know where we are now?

Half a country apart because we divorced because she’s a bitch. "
"They are all still waiting.

Side story.  Friend of mine built a Cobra replica.  He did a great job and it was fantastic looking and sounding.  The kind of car one would want for a casual date night or weekend drive.  He was single at the time and a bunch of us were asking about the girls...

He said the car was NOT a chick magnet.  It was a guy magnet.  Every guy who ever liked a car wanted to talk about this car.  Parking lots, traffic lights, parking garage, etc.  He said he never spoke to more people then when he built that car.  All dudes."
The constant lack of pockets and need for purses/bags.
"Generally speaking, boys are trauma, girls are drama"
Couldn't agree more.
"How's her state of mind? Is it possible she's depressed and it's being reflected in her appearance? Sometimes it's hard for us closest to someone to know or see that they're depressed. But appearance is usually a good indicator - especially weight gain.

Regardless, therapy or counseling might be a better way to address it than criticism. Especially if she's not doing well in her mind. Your criticism may make it worse.
"
"Of course, I agree."
How did you know her name was thrilled?
"Keyword being ""out with her friends"". It's so much easier to approach a woman when there isn't an audience."
"Fine with it, ugly or attractive it's kind of a compliment. I'd also ask why"
"I have found that the kind of people who are chronically late are the kind that don't respect your time. Good on you mate, it doesn't get better with the ones like that. It comes down to thinking their time is more important than yours which is blatantly false since we're all on the same road to dying.

(I make exceptions for genuine reasons if they have a good track record)"
"Having watched my wife squeeze two babies out of her gaping, bleeding vagina, I don't envy childbirth.

I do envy the instant chemical bond that mothers get with their babies though."
"Being ""always late"" is just being inconsiderate. Like certain instances it doesn't matter, but if you're an hour late for plans we made and not a friend of mine I'm not gonna be a happy camper, and especially if there is no apology about it. Like I don't need to accept shit, I can get on perfectly fine with someone else who values me more."

"Senior year of high school ol girl called me while she was taking a bubble bath, said something like ""it would be crazy if i played with myself while you were on the phone huh?""  

My dumb ass: ""you want me to let you go?"""
"I was washing dishes in gym shorts. She has this thing for butts and always tries to mess with mine. She snuck up behind me and rammed her hand into the back of my shorts, I was startled to say the least and spun around really quickly. My elbow met her mouth and broke her tooth. 

Bad right?

Weeeeellllllllllllll a few weeks go by, her tooth is no longer jagged and dangerous, I'm washing dishes again...in gym shorts again. She sneaks up behind me and tries just like before. I spun around and broke the SAME tooth. 

I constantly think about these two times and feel REALLY bad about it but I honestly didn't mean to hurt her! Nor would I ever want to hurt her."

"The problem is all the good advice is absolutely drowning in a lot of bitterness, and guys who are trying to sell you something. If you comb through all the crap it can offer some reasonable advice.

1) Get in shape, the reasons are obvious and shouldn't need to be repeated. You might not look like George Clooney but you should maximize what you have.

2) Stop putting women on pedestals. Women are not angels nor goddess nor magical ethereal beings which can do no wrong. They are imperfect beings that make mistakes, shit and do all the same stuff you do. 

3) Confidence is sexy. Do you know who respects a doormat? No one, there is no one who respects a doormat. The problem is some people in the PUA community seem to think the only to modes are a hapless chump and uber badass alpha male. There is a middle ground, find it.

4) Social skills are like any other skill, they take time and practice to learn and improve. The process of improvement will take time, and involve a lot of rejections. It sucks, but women expect men to approach. That's just the reality of the situation 99% of the time, and if every time you get rejected you retreat into a hole for 6 months your not going to accomplish much.

This is a short summary, but there is valuable advice if you can sift through the bullshit. "

"&gt;just to show the pictures to everyone online

This is what the entire argument boils down to IMO. My girl and I have been in argument after argument about this. Are we going out somewhere to have fun and enjoy life, or are we doing it so you can take pictures and post them online? Are we going on adventures because it's fun, or so you can post pictures on Instagram and tag them #wanderlust#partnersincrime#travel? I just wish she'd stop looking at life as some instagram picture opportunity and just enjoy it for what it is... "

"My mother isn't the same as she used to be.

She spends 90% of her day on facebook/whatever she does online and the other 10% complaining she has to do shit other that sit on the sofa and fucked about on facebook.

That and she's pushing 50 now, she's looking for validation on facebook that even girls in their early 20s aren't getting.

She posts a bunch of stupid shit for other middle aged women she doesn't really give a shit about to see.

It's sad and pathetic if I'm being honest, she's damn near 50 and her life revolves around impressing people on facebook like a teenager, it's not even making her happy, it's the opposite, she's more unhappy now than ever and it's spilling over onto me and the rest of the house.

Every time I tell her to stop doing this shit she gets pissy, tells me to fuck off and ignores me or storms off in a huff.

Fuck social media."
"Scrotum stretching is your body's attempt to keep your nuts cool.  So if you've been packing the boys in briefs and working out in the hot sun, they're going to hang lower than if you've been stocking a walk in cooler.

Potential solutions:

* Get a new toilet seat with ""lifts"" that keep it higher off the rim;
* Get a new toilet;
* Air out your junk for a minute or two before taking a dump.
* Get a supply of dry ice, and drop a piece in the toilet before you sit.  This will cool the air in there and keep things tucked up higher.

"Former Wedding DJ/Musician checking in

1) If you don't have a nice suit but can afford to get one...now is a good time to invest.  If money is tight, just make sure you have a cleanly pressed shirt and pants and that your shoes are polished up real nice.  Also get a haircut and groom your beard if you have one.  No scruffy peach fuzz or 5 oclock shadows either.  Essentially, look how you would look if it were your wedding (minus the tux)

2) DO NOT GET HAMMERED.  Have a couple few drinks to loosen up, but nurse those fuckers all night.  I know its tempting to get shitfaced because its a wedding but that could go horribly wrong.  If you do find yourself a little to tipsy to drive home, bite the bullet and uber.  Drunk driving is not a good look.  Plus if she gets drunk you need to be sober enough to take care of her.

3) Dance with your girlfriend.  I don't care if you are self conscious or you feel like a goober when dancing.  Get out there and dance.  Its a wedding.  Nobody notices if you dance like an idiot...but people absolutely notice if you are pouting in the corner because you refuse to dance.  And if there are some older women there...like Grandmas...and nobody wants to dance with them.  Don't be afraid to ask them to dance.  Its immediately endearing to just about everyone.

4) Be open to helping with the cleanup after the reception.  It will make a really good impression on not only your girlfriend, but her friends if you are willing to roll up your sleeves and help move tables and chairs/pick up garbage.  

5) Pay attention to the little things and toss a few compliments to the bride and groom.  ""This was a really lovely wedding.  You have great taste""  Stuff like that.  

6) Take as many pictures with your date as she wants.  

7) My last piece of advice is couple specific.  I always internally cringe when guys act all shitty about their woman catching the bouquet.  Or being all standoffish because they don't want to even imagine big time commitment.  Its an immature reaction to a silly tradition.  Her catching the thing doesn't mean you are automatically slated to be engaged.  So if she is the type that wants to get out their and catch the damn thing...coach her up like its a football game and tell her to get out their and dominate.   If she is a shy person who really isn't all that interested...but will stand out there because all the girls are doing it...then just be a good wedding guest and clap and congratulate the woman who does catch it."

" My advice, forget her appearance. Focus on helping her find her happiness again. The appearance thing will resolve on its own once she is happy. Start thinking of activities that used to make her happy, or creative new activities she may enjoy. If she has social anxiety, think of less social things to do, and slowly work your way up.

Therapy would be great, but if she is unwilling to go, don't keep pushing her. Just focus on building her up (without sounding patronizing), and try to find fun things to do together."
"God this is me.

I can have friends, I can be friendly, I can be social, I thought for a long time that I couldn't do it and that it was why I didn't have friends/people in my life. But no, I can do it, and I can do it really fucking well.

But I don't want it. I don't want friends or people to hang out, I thrive on being alone, its when I feel better when I am alone. I'm very fine with not having friends and I'm not sure if I want to change my ""non social"" type of behavior. "
"The fact that she seemed proud of always being late and not giving you a straight apology really seals the deal.

Unless anything else happens from her side like a genuine apology and promise to work on her time management, I would just say to move on to the next girl.
"
"Exactly the problem for a lot of guys. It takes godlike confidence to approach a woman surrounded by friends. 

You’re potentially interrupting their good time, you have judging bystanders, and she is likely to feel pressure to respond the way her friends would want her to. Overcoming the doubt that creates is monumental in my experience. 

Edit: I’ll go as far as to say that if you think a guy is interested in you and you’d like him to approach, find a way to break away from your friends and do something alone for a minute. He’ll see his chance and hopefully work up his confidence to head over before you give up and go back to your friends. "
"Not a man, but wanted to jump in. Depends on how serious you want to get with things. If it means smashing at my place versus yours, no worries. If you want me to move in, it’s going to take some time to get used to. 

My best friend’s mom died today. She was 56, he’s 27. Life is short. Your mom means a lot to you obviously. Do what your heart says is right. The right woman will understand."

"Tell her that you've read about how running is great for anxiety management (this is 100% true) and that you've been feeling anxious/stressed lately, so how about you two go running together? Because you know she struggles with anxiety too and you can now tackle it together. "

"I work at a gym and I constantly see women with different crazy designs and textures on their yoga pants. 9/10 of the time when I say like the design, they come back with ""Thanks, it has pockets!"" and then proceed to show me their hidden spandex pockets."
"I've been on the receiving end of one of these conversations a few years ago. My husband, then boyfriend, bluntly but kindly asked me to start working out and taking care of myself again. At the time, I was skinniest I've ever been because I was going through a rough semester and I skip meals when stressed. 

He was concerned about my health and he approached the topic in a way that made it about our lives together. He essentially said he didn't want that time cut short or restricted by self-imposed health issues. 

It sucked to hear and it made me feel unattractive and insecure, none of which he ever meant for me to feel. I was also mad that my appearance mattered at all to him. He needed to reassure me a lot and talk through my insecurities but ultimately the message got through. I started working out again for my health (not appearance) for which he gave me lots of praise. This brought my appetite back. I'm healthier now and do my best to workout regularly. 

I guess my long winded point is that you should consider a blunt conversation about her health. Sprinkling and hinting, at least for me, would have created insecurities and emotions without opening the door to discussing them. 

I personally needed to know that he would not leave me due to my appearance alone. As the cliche goes, I needed to know he would love me even at my worst, but encourage me to be the best version of myself.

As far as the way she dresses, I wonder if that is because she is already unhappy with her appearance and doing it as a sort of defense mechanism. Maybe take her shopping and genuienly  compliment her. Ask her to please wear that one outfit you love for dinner tonight because you've been thinking about her legs in that skirt (or whatever) all day. 

TL;DR: Build up the things you love about her now and have an honest discussion about improving her health in the long term "

"I have one of each so I can share both perspectives. I don’t think there is an advantage with one versus the other. They both have their pluses and minuses, and pretty much balances itself out. Even being a guy I genuinely believe the girls are much more mature than boys, especially in the preteen years. I must say I have a much closer relationship with my daughter then my son. Regardless of if you have a boy or girl, it all depends on how good of a parent you are to them. Shitty parenting will result in a kid with some serious behavior issues and could become a nightmare! Whichever you have they are both amazing in their own right, only  if the parents are."
"By far the biggest one is being well socialised. If you can walk into a room, say hello to people, talk to them, listen, maybe make them laugh a bit and treat them like they're worth your time, women like that. Especially if you can talk to women without being a nervous wreck, or acting overly cocky/thirsty.

Being socially courageous and relaxed is attractive. Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, you should develop these skills."

"When I was younger, yeah, every woman was intimidating.  My line of thinking was ""man, she's so hot, there's no way she doesn't have a guy"".  Even if she didn't, I didn't have the self confidence to think that she'd be attracted to me.

Fortunately I grew out of that childish nonsense.  These days I don't find any woman intimidating.  She's just a person and no matter how hot she is she has her own hang-ups, insecurities, dreams, goals, likes, dislikes, and all that just like anyone else.  The worst that could possibly happen is I'm not her type and that's perfectly OK.  I just wish it didn't take me until my 30's to figure that out."

"One of my first girlfriends came into the bathroom while i was taking a shower and started throwing cold water over me.

"My first ever boyfriend back in the days of MySpace refused to change his relationship status or acknowledge me at all online, and a couple of months after he broke up with me I checked his profile and it was plastered with another girl. His profile was even shit like ""I'm learning to cook because [new girlfriend] deserves the best"". That cut me so deeply and it's just about the only area I carry any insecurity in a relationship, despite the fact it was over a decade ago. 

Someone else said that wanting online validation is a red flag for them, but for me the refusal to give that validation is a red flag. I'd be telling my most recent ex a story and he'd say ""Oh yeah, I saw that on Facebook"" but he'd never like or acknowledge the post itself. He'd shower me in compliments but didn't say a word the one time I changed my profile picture, despite us texting exclusively through Messenger. He only changed his relationship status after my family pressed him about it over Christmas, as he was all over me in person but a stranger online. And a few months later he broke up with me by saying he'd never actually loved me and being with me made him sick.

I'm very comfortable online and if I see something I like, I like it. If my SO goes on Facebook daily and looks at my posts but refuses to like them, it hurts. It makes me feel shunned, or like he doesn't want to be associated with me. It makes me feel like he doesn't care. 

It's not about getting as many likes as possible: it's wanting one from the most important person of all.

If you don't ever use Facebook, it's a bit silly of her to get so worked up over unliked pictures you'd never have seen anyway -- but perhaps it's a love language for her and a like is far more meaningful to her than you realise? In which case you need to kindly explain your position to her while also understanding hers, and perhaps find a compromise. (No dismissing her views as ""dumb"" and ""stupid"", please.) But if you're on Facebook, see the pictures, and make the conscious choice not to acknowledge them, I can fully see why she'd feel hurt by that. I've been there. I've had the words of affirmation in person and nothing online, and both times I've had my heart crushed. It doesn't mean every guy who doesn't do likes is a manipulative heartbreaker who's going to hurt me, but it certainly wouldn't make me feel loved by them."

I had a really tiny apartment back then and I could easily navigate through it in the dark. She crept up behind me, though, and jumped on me. I swear, I really thought I was going to puke my heart out.

Instinctively, I spun around and used the momentum to punch her right in the jaw before she had the chance to even laugh - I honestly didn't know I've had it in me.

"Well, Freud had the right idea, but a lot of people misinterpret them. No, children don't want to have sex with their parents. That's sick, and it's also very unlikely per the Westermarck effect. But typically, a girl will look to her mother for inspiration on how to be and look to her father for the kind of guy to date, and vice versa. Of course, when you throw gays/lesbians and trans into the mix, it can change, but generally speaking Freud was right.

If you're a man and you're raising a son, he's going to challenge you more than a daughter will (she'll be challenging her mother more). Your son is either going to want to be like you, or he's going to want to *not* be like you, but part of who he is is going to be based on the kind of man you are. Not just your profession, but your philosophy as well. Meanwhile, your daughter will be watching how you treat her mother. If you mistreat her mother, that's what she'll accept from her partners. If you treat her mother well, she will ideally strive for the same.

Regarding hobbies... let me tell you about the most Ron Swanson-like man I know. My uncle. He's actually my mother's uncle. Basically he was an accident, and grew up the same age as his sister's oldest boy, but six months younger. Anyway, right out of high school, he got a job with the power company. Instead of getting a place and paying bills, he bought a small piece of land in the mountains, and put all his money into savings. He built a small cabin up there and had some pretty killer parties in his younger years. Fast forward to being married and having bought his first house outright with cash. He probably wanted sons, but he got two girls. Zero fucks given, he raised them like he would have raised boys. I've never seen either of them in a dress. They were both tomboys, but the older one was more sporty than tomboy, I think. So she was all girl but not a princess. They were my favourite cousins when I was a kid, and not because they were small and cute. They were actually always trying to fight me when they were small.

Back to topic, until they're about 4 years old, whether it's a boy or a girl, it's basically the same, except a boy can pee on you when you're changing him. For that to happen with a girl, you have to be at a very awkward angle. Basically girls pee straight down, like adults, but boys, having only about 1cm, will pee straight out. Other than that, and the style of clothes your family will buy them, raising them is pretty much going to be the same. And in those 4-5 years, you'll get to know them as individuals — most of the time, they won't be ""a boy"" or ""a girl,"" they'll be themselves. Some boys are feminine and some girls are masculine and that doesn't mean they're gay or lesbian or trans. Just let them be themselves, and teach them as best you can."
Thanks Dad.

"I am currently seeing a girl and she's obsessed with facebook. 

We were having a conversation a while ago about something unrelated to social media, she's there scrolling through her phone as usual, and all of a sudden she says ""Why don't you ever comment and like on my pics?"" in a clear upset tone. I give her the side eye and look as if to say are you stupid, without actually saying it and simply tell her that I compliment her and her pictures often enough in person. Why would I log in to facebook and do the same?

She then goes on to say ""it's not the same"" and at that point I'm just head scratching at how dumb this conversation is/how brainwashed she's become and simply just ignore her and move on to something else."

"Not exactly the woman in my life but somebody I knew fairly well:

She just became obsessed with Instagram and because she couldn't possibly gain more likes by her rather generic ""fashion pictures"" she did what almost all of them do and she started to buy followers (at first). However, I think she eventually figured out that people are going to notice how she has like 20k followers and only about 30-50 likes on her pictures. So of course she also started to buy likes for her pictures. 

Nowadays she has about 67k follower (she had more than 80k, but Instagram deleted a lot of them) and almost everybody who knows her from a few years back talks badly about her because all she cares nowadays is the validation by her bots and by automated comments from other ""fashion instagramers"" like ""so pretty"" or just ""😍"". 

Luckily for her she found a rich husband who doesn't seem to care that she's so deeply involved in Social Media - she even got a kid now, which I'm still debating with friends if it is either a real love child or just a prop for better/more/less generic content. 

Oh - and she dropped out of law school because Instagram was more important. "

Going on 9 years of marriage, there was a point where we had a break in communication that almost ended up me filing for divorce, I had the paperwork filled out and bags packed, as I was walking out, I let everything out and then she did.

We’d disagreed about a few controversial topics on the way to the lake and she seemed upset with me. We had a good time and it blew over, we were singing in the car and snap chatting on the way home. It was a good time.

Long story short, she was actually psychotic as hell and furious that I didn’t want kids. She tried to say I held her down, beat, and raped her, and that I left her at the lake overnight. I spent 4 nights in jail and went to court for it afterwards. I got it dismissed because I presented a video I took of us singing &amp; laughing &amp; smiling on the way home that I saved to snapchat. I don’t normally save snaps but it was cute and I liked it. The judge threw out the case nearly instantly. I got an OK paycheck and she got jail time for it.

I even tucked her in so she would be extra comfortable.........she got up 5 minutes later and was quite annoyed at me for the rest of the party.

"Once. First year in college I was living with six girls. They were all really cool, and we got along very well. One night we had a party, one of the girls cousins was there. She got drunk and fell asleep in my bed. The next morning we were all sitting around eating and she told her cousin that I had been feeling her up in her sleep, and she was afraid I was going to rape her.

I just sat there in stunned silence. The only problem with the girls story was that I hadn't gone near my room all night, and had been in another room with two of my housemates, all of us awake for the entire duration. The girls I lived with lost their fucking minds, kicked the girl who accused me out of the house. I never say her again, and my friend never spoke to her after that.

I don't know what was up with the girl, if she was just the kind of person who did that, or had some weird drunken fever dream or whatever. I was pretty fucking glad things went down the way they did, and i'll never forget that weird creeping horror that set in when those words came out of her mouth. 

So that's once in nearly 4 decades. "

"Every dude says get a car for the ladies, but they're wrong. Get it for you (and dudes will follow). The key, heh, is in motorcycles, but not how you think.  It's not about how fast, cool, loud, etc it is, it's 100% about the mistery it brings.  The most important part is being 100% chill about owning one, it's just something in your life. Yes, you take care of it like a car(or more), you drive it everywhere, you understand the risk and you aren't bragging about it, just accepting them.

What this looks like is, you go on a few dates(or like me, date for 3 months prior because it's winter), she sees pull up on it once and says, ""what?! I didn't know you ride a motorcycle!?"" And you just say, ""yeah, I like it"" and go about the date.  Now she's thinking, wait, what other secrets is he keeping!? Who is this guy?! I want to know him!

Ok. So that was totally over the top, but truth be told, my motorcycle has never won me any ladies so to speak. But it has just been another feather in my cap. My girlfriend found out after dating a while and later told me that, even though she thought I was hot already, somehow it made me hotter knowing I rode and could take her on rides.

"Aside from creeps and catcalls, which by far seem like the worst...

The sheer amount of effort women have to put into their appearance. Not even counting stuff like being really careful about calorie intake, everything I've heard about shopping for women's clothes makes it sound awful. Sizes are inconsistent between manufacturers, and even between different lines by the same manufacturer, an ""eight"" might be vastly different sizes. Makeup, color coordination for clothes/purses/shoes/makeup, a lot of clothes that might look good but are uncomfortable, shaving/waxing/plucking EVERYTHING... Jesus. I brush my hair and put on a clean set of clothes appropriate for the weather, and I'm pretty much done, and ever since I decided to let my beard grow out I don't even have to shave.

I've also heard a lot of stories about people, both men and women, refusing to take something a woman said seriously, **just because it was coming from a woman.** When they're told the exact same thing by a man, even one who's a subordinate to the woman they were just talking to, THEN these people will accept it, but until then it might as well just be nonsense. I'd probably wind up stabbing someone if I were treated like that."

One day we were hanging out, and she called me out on not liking her Facebook or noticing she changed her Instagram profile picture. I said that I wasn’t on social media that time and then continued to call me out on other post I didn’t “Like.” I was shocked that she was keeping track of who “liked” her posts. She even kept track of who looked at her Snapchat and refused to tell me what she did that day until I looked at her Snapchat during our hangout!

"Years ago, I befriended a female coworker.  She and I would do things together on weekends on occasion but it was strictly platonic.  Twice she slipped and referred to me as her boyfriend.  I immediately corrected her and she said it was just a mistake.

One day she asked me what I was doing on the weekend.  I said I was going to Niagara Falls.  She said by yourself?  I said no I’m going with someone I’m dating.

The following work week suddenly her behavior became very odd and about midweek she burst into my office and told me what a worthless person I am and just screamed and shouted  at me for quite some time.  At the end of her tirade she said “don’t speak to me again, you make me feel awful with everything you say”.  I never complained to the boss because she basically controlled him in every way.   He was married but the two of them went drinking together every week  and jogged together at lunch.

From that point forward I only spoke with her to get work business done.  It was all business and no chit chat.

About a month later I was called into the boss’s office and accused of harassing her by creating a hostile work environment because I refused to communicate with her.

I was lucky in that there were other women in the office who witnessed her meltdown and heard her tell me not to speak to her and also witnessed me speak to her about work business.

So the accusations were found to be baseless.

She also accused a male coworker of harassment and claimed he was spraying chemicals to make her sick.  A rapid investigation found that he was eating an orange.

On the flip side.  Years later when I was a manager, a very trustworthy female employee came to me and said a male coworker put his hand on her butt.  There was zero doubt he did it as this guy was the creepiest bastard you’ve ever met, constantly making inappropriate sexual innuendo’s, talking about “getting some” from fellow female workers.  He was just a gross perv.   

The bottom line was it was his word against her’s and HR did nothing.   I sat down with both of them separately and told them there would be no action taken but if there were additional occurrences, etc, etc, etc.

As this asshole was leaving my office he turns to me and says “look you can’t blame me for trying get a piece of it...  I mean everyone else has had a turn”

First off this was completely false.  This woman did not date or mess around with anyone in the office and I had known her for over 10 years.  Not that it mattered.

Secondly he just confessed to sexual assault of a female employee.  So I immediately contacted HR for termination.

"Oh yeah, I agree. Seeing her on the ground not moving and not knowing how badly she was hurt was scary. I was literally begging her to wake up. I'm so thankful she ended up being okay after it all. I mean, she's tough, she can take a punch more than any girl I've ever met, but it's just scary. "
Lol and you tucked her in like child... must have been quite the blow to her confidence!
Being approached while at a bar or club instead of always being the one having to approach.
Most women I meet can’t really take a joke.  So if they can laugh at themselves then that’s super attractive to me.

"&gt; Sprinkling and hinting, at least for me, would have created insecurities and emotions without opening the door to discussing them.


This is my experience with just about every woman I know to be in a relationship. For all the notion of women speaking with hints, they mostly don't know when someone is hinting something to them, they just get worked up by a bunch of insecurities at what the thousands of possible meanings are. You have very good advice that OP would do well to heed."
"Honestly, it sounds like you will be happier in the long run. Just think about how your life would have played out if everything your wife did was based around the perception of others, while never giving a shit what you thought. Hope your life is better now my bro."
"I’m sexually deprived, and lonely but I also hate one night stands, or rushing into a relationship. I also dislike prostitution, so that sucks. Besides that shits pretty good."
Sedentary lifestyles and poor diets are a hell of a combination.
"This so much this. 

And to add to your sentiment:

Men/Fathers, your daughter will learn her worth (when young) from you. Want her to know her value as a human being contributing this planet? Want her to know that those penis's trying to get inside her dont define her? Teach her first by valuing her beyond how many dudes may or may not want to fuck her. Teach her that she is capable of making good decisions on her own. And then for fucks sake let her make those decisions! If you did a good job she will likely have a good head on her shoulders. Not to mention you can save her a lot of time and heartache by not needing her to spend a few years of her adult life teaching herself all those lessons you could have taught her. "
"Don't sprinkle man. Work out whether she's happy or not and once she is in a better place, talk to her openly. I fear if she feels you are hinting at no longer finding her attractive then likely she's gonna go in anxiety overdrive and not feel comfortable telling you. If it doesn't bother you enough to risk an open conversation, don't try to sneak it in 

Source: drove my ex deeper into her anxiety without meaning to. Lead to us breaking up sadly"
Long hair on a windy day.
"Some of these might be unpopular opinions but here goes: 

Love. Be a person who embodies love. Get rid of that hate in your heart. Love and respect all. Animals, humans, family, friends, your relationship with her, everything. But don’t be a wuss. 

Stand the fuck up for what you believe in. Stand up for the what the fuck is right. Your beliefs? Be comfortable with it. If you follow a certain religion? Be proud of that shit. but there is a difference between being proud and being arrogant. 

Learn how to take a joke. Self deprecating humor is ok once in a while, but if every other word out your mouth is about how useless you are, she’s gonna get turned off. 

Don’t call her “bro” unironically. Lol

Empathy. Sympathy. Sociopathy^^/s

Nice hair, either clean shaven or groomed beard. Figure out what looks good on you. For me, a light skinned dude with a big ass head, a cut ain’t lookin good is short short and shaped up or even a crop top super high military fade (I don’t like looking like a military dude, also when my dark hair grows out my white skin it looks gray), but a longer on the top, shorter combover, and mid/low fade or brook look good, with the shaped up sideburns, beard. Be realistic. Something that might look good on someone else might not look good on you. It’s kinda tough to find a good cut, but as long as it’s cut relatively recently, and is clean, you good 

Facial hair: be realistic. If you got 13 year old half pube looking beard at 27, you better off clean shaven or something else. If you can somewhat grow a beard, keep that shit maintained. Learn to do it yourself. NO CHIN STRAPS/PENCIL BEARDS. Tread with caution with goatees/just the Stache. It’s hard to pull off without looking sus 

Goals. Get a job. Finish that degree. Get an A in that class. Do your laundry. Above all else show that you got ambition, because who wants to be with someone who does nothing with his life. 

Being faithful. To her and your family / friends, anyone else. 

Respect: new person? Treat with respect at first. Then, treat them as they treat you, but always take the high road. Never take the low road. Be cool to people. 

Being a good person. Selfless. Honest. 

Body hair. Leave it. Unless she likes it, or you a pro BB or some shit. I guess this is subjective. 

Good fitting clothes. Stylish clothes. Stop spending $200 on a shitty Versace T that won’t even fit you but you bought cause on sale. If she’s not a gold digger she won’t give 2 fucks. JCPenney got some good fitting clothes for cheap. Check out male fashion advice on Reddit it’s easier and cheaper than you think plus your self conf will boost

Being clean. Looking clean. Smelling clean &gt; smelling like overwhelming cologne. 

Act carefree. Not blah blah nothing matters, I mean down to earth, nothing can get to me, laugh it off, and stand your ground. Some man shit right here boi

Body: Forearms (do heavy deads for this), hands (yeah idk but a lot of girls liked my hands??), chest, legs. Just hit the gym man what can I tell you. Do cardio. Don’t be a stereotypical “gym bro” I’m the alpha male type asshole only immature girls like that shit

Face: try to get rid of acne, blackheads. Don’t be lazy. Use a skincare routine. 

Stop trying to fuck every person you see up. I grew up fighting people in school, and in the street many times. It’s not fucking worth it. 

Try not to get arrested. Bad. And that’s all I have to say about that. 

Smiling, and seeming like a happy positive person (just fake it if you’re severely depressed like me, even tho it’s tough) 

Open up to people. Be a feeling person. Stop trying to be an edgy anime protagonist that shit doesn’t exist. Stop trying to act like Cloud strife or commander Shepard or Gerald of rivia. Act like YOU. and have other dudes copy YOU. 

Leader not a follower. Leader, not a boss. Take control. 

Don’t be clingy. When you just get the digits, treat her as you would any friend. Idk how old you are, but a lot of girls in teen years, even early 20s like to play that “texting game” like oh I’m gonna wait 30 mins before text back to play hard to get. I never play along. If I’m around phone, she text? Reply immediately. If I’m busy? Reply when I can. Why the fuck do I have time to play those games. (I’m in early-mid 20s so I grew up with girls playing that game since like 13 years old)

Being a joking prick on the surface - tease the SHIT outta her, never stop. But when shit hits the fan, MAN UP. Flirt often, give compliments disguised as teasing. When you In that flirting stage and know her well and have a shot, give her that “I would fuck the shit outta you given the chance and I know you would too and I love it, but I’m just gonna continue to tease you”

Be good at sex. Nah it’s not about busting late. It’s about foreplay. Read shades of gray, or whatever the fuck. Warm her up ALOT. whisper in her ear, kiss (not just her lips and boobs), but her neck, stomach, inner thighs, etc, run fingers along side of stomach/torso, tease her like mad, tell her to beg for that shit. until she’s in fact begging for that shit. No homo lol

Get comfortable at eating pussy. Get good at eating pussy. It’s not that hard and your relationship will be a hell of a lot better. Most chicks can’t even cum without foreplay and shit (not from dick alone), I think a lot of marriages lose their spark because both the woman and the man neglect foreplay, and neglect taking time, and simply sucking dick or eating Pussy

Be yourself: be passionate about whatever it is. Even if it’s Pokémon. And don’t be scared about it. BUT don’t go overboard with that shit. Don’t talk about wow at every turn, or have her role play as Charizard during sex (inb4 charizard transformation fetish comic lmao)

Having hobbies. “Cool” ones. If you don’t, get some. Some examples might be kayaking, snowboarding, cliff jumping. I hated all these things until I tried Em now I live them

Having friends. Knowing people. Having people be cool with you. Making even more friends. (If someone can help me with this one that would be great. 

Having a gf (yea apparently you become 1000x more attractive for some reason)

Confidence. Stop looking down. Look straight when you walk. Posture. 

Shyness (humbleness and quietness not creepy quite. It’s mysterious and if u got nothing good to say don’t. Makes what you say all the more profound)

I’ll get flak for this but: STOP the non-stop meaningless talking. Especially in a group. Always trying to be the “life of the party” or the center of attention shows your insecurity. Show her you ain’t afraid of a little silence. You are comfortable no matter what. 

If she likes you for your cheddar only, leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her

Stop worrying about eye contact. If you think about it: 1) you won’t have any idea what she’s saying and will struggle to keep convo going 2) will look like your anxious as fuck looking away every .5 seconds like she’s ugly or something or 3) look like a fucking psycho staring at her without blinking. Easier said than done. Practice makes perfect. 

Up to you: I still try to be old school. Jacket of cold, walk on street side of sidewalk, offer to pay for meals. If she wants to pay? Cool tho. Be cool

Have a massive dick^^/s. It actually doesn’t matter. Fuck the dick (heh), act like you got big balls instead. She expects you to protect her, so do just that.

#Above all else: don’t worry about these things actively. Instead, change your life to BECOME this kind of person. Don’t just fake it. You’ll be happier anyway. I know it’s easier said than done. "
"Why? 
I mean she is one day going to be a groen up woman. In the process she is going to get hurt, meet some nice men, some jerks... it is all part if learning. 

I hate how men are so protective to their daughters and guys she meets. Better raise her ao she knows how to deal with them by herself. "
"I wink at them, flex my enormous biceps, hit her with a seductive pelvic thrust while doing a quick tongue flicker at her to demonstrate what I bring to the table. "
"I'm a woman, so I need to ask, who was the more casually dressed partner in the beginning of the relationship? I speak from experience that my SO was the casual one, with golf shirts, jeans, sneakers; it made me dress down all the time from my little black dresses and high heels. He drank beer and ate pizza, which I had no problem with joining him in for but it was a slippery slope into casual and comfy attire. Getting him to dress up a little was tough. 🤔 So, maybe tell your SO that it's a legit date night and ask her her opinion on which dress shirt she likes better for you to wear, so she gets the idea to not wear our beloved yoga pants, or can at least dress them up! Just my opinion from my experience! If you haven't gone this route yet, what have you got to lose! Might perk her up some to know that you're caring how they see you, and instill the same in them. "

"r/todayilearned because I posted something along the lines of ""TIL the name of the lead singer of Linkin Park."" This was on the day that he died.

I’ve seen it destroy many a relationship. Women for some reason crave the validation. A lot of times that spills into a few little instagram flings. Be wary 
"High School. There was a chick that was constantly trying to spend more time with me, but something about the way she presented it never hit the mark until years later.

Things like she noticed I would walk home, so one day she offered to give me rides to and from school. Said ""Naw, I like the walk."" We had a photography class together and she offered to go out and shoot some pictures, ""Naw, busy that day."" Had to have gone on for at least a couple months, but my dumbass just saw ""Preppy chick"" and never actually even considered I had a chance with her at the time.

She was bangin', too - in my personal opinion probably the hottest girl in my grade. Awesome personality too, she was smart and probably the nicest person I've ever met. She ended up getting together with someone else - they dated all through high school and I think they're married last I heard. "
Now you look like a smug asshole.
"How do you dress / how much effort do you put in? It can be easy to start letting things slide. Talking to her about this is the main thing to do, but have you considered noticable upping the effort you make day-to-day to encourage her? Definitely encourage her to take care of her mental health (exercise is great, thearpy ect)"
oh and here im thinking “professional? a pro at suckin dick?”
"-Overweight/doesn't care about fitness or their health.

-""If you can't handle me at my worst..."".  RUN!!!

-Sort of related to the above one, but girls who basically admit they have some very negative trait, but don't want to try and improve themselves (example: some time ago someone posted on this sub about a woman who was late as hell for their date, and her response was ""oh well haha I'm always really late to everything, better get used to it!"").

-Won't stay off their phone.

-Talks poorly about their exes, and/or basically makes it sound like ALL their exes were awful and she never did anything wrong.

-Ungrateful and entitled attitude."

Receiving a compliment once in a while
It's classic entitlement.
"I was at one time, but I refuse to be a part of it anymore. I won't take pictures of her unless it's a legitimate picture moment (none of this 'pose with my drink at the *perfect* angle' bullshit). I won't take selfies with her. I make stupid faces and give her the finger (lovingly) when she tries to take pictures of me. I leave over the top idiotic comments on all of the fake instagram pictures she posts. I get the dog riled up so he won't sit still for her to take pictures.

Overall, I do my best to sabatoge it and call her out when she gets to into 'competitive instagramming' mode. Seems to be working, she's gotten loads better. "
"Sounds like you know she isn’t available.

So get over it?

Edit: sorry, that’s a tad cold. I’ve had a crush on someone unavailable before. It’s unhealthy. The only thing you can do is be honest with yourself about the situation and move past it. Don’t view her as an option unless she approaches you in the future. And don’t set yourself up to be approached in hopes she will. You move on."
"Here’s mine, happened over the past few days.

So this girl was pretty flirty in general with me at first. For example, I had been dancing a lot and she asked to try dancing on me to see how good I was at it. So of course I’m like hell yeah, she does that, tells me I’m really good and I’m just like “lol thanks.” Not the best response. At one point she also came out onto the porch and there were no more chairs, so she hopped into my chair with me. 

Then one night when we’re both just out on the balcony chilling she tells me that she and her friend got the impression I had a huge dick and asked me how big it was. So I just told her the truth that I hadn’t ever measured it and she said something like “oh well we need to check before you leave” (we were on vacation in FL w a group of people). And I answered by asking if she had a fucking ruler. While out on the balcony she also kept talking about how soft her thighs were since she had shaved. And I still didn’t fucking do anything.

I’ve never been great at picking up social cues since I have Asperger’s, but realizing afterward how **obvious** she was made it was kind of a slap in the face lol. I didn’t realize I was *that* bad at it.

Edit: a word"

"Because they are kind of supposed to be parallels of Lorelai, Luke, and Christopher. Lorelai gets hung up on Christopher every time he comes around and it takes her forever to finally realize that Luke is better for her. Rory seems to be pulled back to Logan in much the same way, while Jess is shown to be the better option and the more steady presence in her life throughout the years.

I hate it, I’m Team Jess all the way, but a big theme throughout Gilmore Girls is feeling caught between two worlds. And that’s exemplified in Lorelai and Rory’s romantic choices."

"This is 100% me. 

And it's almost cruel since during my middle and high school years I was cripplingly shy and unconfident with myself. I didn't have too many friends. Now that I'm a bit older, I find I don't *want* a ton of friends. Maybe one person that I can really get along with, but people are exhausting. And yet I've never been so confident and amiable in my life. 

I dunno. Maybe someday I'll just move into a cave in some godforsaken mountain 👍🏼"
Just tell her that.  I'd be tickled pink if someone said that to me at the gym.  
"Honesty, no matter how trivial. Also helps to date someone who you see as a teammate, best friend, and romantic partner all in one."
"Experiencing the exact same thing at home too. Mum is shit with computers but I finally taught her how to use Facebook on her phone like a year ago. 

It's slowly turned her brain into mush. If she's not at work, she's in bed on lying on the couch looking at Facebook or Insta all day. She'll get off as soon as everyone's starting to go to bed and starts screaming about how no ones doing anything, no one helps her around the house, no one loves her etc. 

She's getting into arguments with dad over the silliest and smallest problems, but the truth of her frustration always comes out in the end, like... ""x is in Bali right now, why can't you treat me like that?!"" Ummm you've got like 200 friends on Facebook and 1 of them is on holiday. 
She'll be back in the office doing the exact same thing as you in like 14 days. 

I somehow got dragged into the last holiday my parents went on and it was horrible. Mum just tricking dad to go to every location she saw on Instagram. And she starts posing like a school girl for a lousy 20 likes from people she doesn't even like. 

This happens every few days now, she'll  say/ask something to us while looking at her phone, we'll reply and she doesn't remember saying anything. "
"Woman chiming in here, and I think that’s a perfect suggestion!

When she starts putting on her yoga pants and tee shirts you could also say something like “I think we might look a little too dressed down if we show up to this venue in tee shirts. I love that outfit that you wore to ____!” Stating it with “we” frames it more as a decision you’re making as a couple to dress up rather than a personal critique at her. "
"Super aggressive ""I'm the boss and have to show it"" kind of people. Just chill out. "
"My ex decided a great way to get revenge for me breaking up with her was to claim I raped her friend.  Said friend had said she was blackout drunk, and I was there at the time, so she figured she could just make it up and the friend wouldn't know any better.

Thing was, the friend wasn't actually blackout drunk, and just claimed to be because she was embarrassed about her behavior that night, so she didn't really go along with it.  But she was mortified about what had actually happened so she didn't dispute the claim for about a month.  That month was absolutely hellish, and she was ready to let the rumors stand until she realized I wasn't telling anyone what had actually happened that night.  At that point, she apologized and put in writing that nothing like that had ever happened.

I figured that's where it stands now... as long as I never tell the truth to any mutual friends about what she had actually done, she'll keep making sure those rumors don't crop up again.  But it was absolutely terrifying at the time and it still sucks now.

As for how common it is... false claims do happen.  I don't know how much.  I've worked as a peer counselor for a long time, and I've definitely seen them, and they even look different so you can spot them if you know how... but it takes time and listening and experience to do that."
"Yeah, it's the other side of the ""friend zone"" coin. The girls who thought they had a real friend."
"Then transition it into hiking (if applicable in your area) since it's so fucking relaxing, but also a great workout."

"Not a guy, have taught children to ride bikes., am assuming you don’t mean motorcycle. 

1) have her ignore the peddles for a moment, and ride around just pushing with her feet, getting use to how it wobbles/ how to keep it steady. 
2) use peddles. This might freak her out, but let her move at her own time.
3) seriously, let her move at her own time, and have her wear a helmet, and when you get on a bike, PUT ONE ON SO SHE DOESN’T FEEL WEIRD. 


Use a place where she doesn’t have to worry about feeling embarrassed over this- she doesn’t need neighbors laughing at her.

Be aware that if she has something wrong with her inner ear, her sense of balance might be shit. It’s why my brother still “doesn’t know” how to ride a bike. Dude has no balance. 

Good luck! "
"Straight guy but my main friend group in my late teens were mainly LGBT.   
Lead to me going to LGBT clubs with them for my first outings between 16 and 19yrs old.  
Sometimes there were straight girls at the clubs too, but they obviously weren't easy to pick out. I was fine getting wasted and dancing.  
Two friends from the group: Mary is a shy girl in general. Chris is a chaotic asshole when off the liquor.  


One night, Chris winds up stealing Mary's bra somehow. She's freaking out. I'm chasing him around the club. On my way down some stairs. Girl who has been watching all night winds up in my way  


Girl: Do you wanna dance? :)  
Me (trying to keep visual track of Chris): No no sorry.  
Girl (Sort of taken back): ...Do you want a sip of my drink?  
Me: Maybe later. Bye \*hauls ass down the stairs after Chris\*  


I had noticed this girl because she was super cute and looking at me for a fair portion of the night. Figure she was just as shy as I was and finally mustered up the courage to ask me and it totally went over my head in the heat of the moment. ....Fuckin' Chris \*shakes fist\*

Hot guys?
"I think the chances of being molested as a girl or taken advantage of as a teen are much higher if you're a girl.  Especially if you're from one of these religious households that put such demands about avoiding sex and then play it off as a ""boys will be boys"" sorta thing when it does happen.  AKA:  Josh Duggard.  Plus you hear all the time of girls being groomed by pastors for abuse.

On that note, the sexual dysfunction some women report from having been raised in an environment where they're taught that premarital sex is bad and that their entire worth as a person depends on their hymen remaining intact until marriage.  Then, when the big night comes, they have such hangups about sex that some cannot physically do it.  The muscles ""down there"" won't relax enough or whatnot because they can't get that stigma outta their headas even though it's ""OK"" to have sex now.  It's not like they can flip a switch.

Then there's society's tendency to blame the rape victim when she's raped.

Also, you  can never be sure if some guy(s) are taking some hidden pics of you.  All the time you read stories of women who didn't know they were being filmed in the shower or something.  Hell, the US Navy had a big scandel a couple yrs ago where a BUNCH of sailors got busted for videoing women in the shower onboard one of their subs.  I think that involved 20-30 guys who were in on it.  If I recall correctly, I think one woman quit the sub service because she just couldn't trust it anymore. 

And if you're a woman, there's nothing you can do that's right.  Get pregnant outta wedlock?  You're a slut.  Have an abortion?  How can you MURDER your BABY!?!  Not having an abortion?  How are you gonna afford it?  WELFARE!!?!?  LAZY BITCH!  Spank your kid?  Abusive mom.  Don't spank?  Letting them run wild.  Don't want kids?  Oh, you'll change your mind, just wait and see.

I mean, we men have our own, different issue's but I think, to be fair, it's tougher to be a woman in many more ways.  I don't worry about being stalked, harassed, raped, the constant judgement of my wort based on my sex, etc."
"Not sure what to all this, but it's something like 'good-heartedness'. It's the little things like recycling, picking up pieces of litter, holding the door open for someone with children, being a passive driver, not getting impatient with cashiers and other service employees, thanking people often, not letting one rude asshole ruin her mood, etc.

You can't really quantify it. You won't find it in a dating profile. But when you see it, you notice it. And it's wonderful."
"My mom and dad have been married for almost 26 years. My mom says that there's one thing that's more important than love, communication, compromise, and all that jazz. 

She says the number one most important key to a successful relationship is mutual respect. If you lose respect for each other, the relationship is over. She says she doesn't always like what my dad has to say, and she most definitely doesn't always agree with him. But no matter what, her (their) respect is unwavering, and that's why they're happy together. "
"Well my dating life has been very difficult because I am only into very muscular women.  So even skinny hot girls that everyone goes for, I just find them meh.  But luckily I attended enough local bodybuilding shows and crossfit events to land a girlfriend with pretty substantial muscles and strength, and it was a total surprise when she liked that I was smaller, because these muscle women tend to go for big guys."
Why?
"no

2/3 of women are overweight, and half of the overweight women are obese"
"I think item 3 is perhaps one of the most important items on your list.
 
While there is a SMALL grain of truth to many of the techniques promoted by the ""PUA"" community, the reason that so many guys fail when trying to utilize said techniques is because they tend to see gender relations/dating/relationships in overwhelmingly binary terms, thus setting themselves up for failure. Finding balance and appropriate context goes a long way when it comes to flirting/dating/etc.  (this goes hand in hand with item #4)"

"I'd just like to point out that in general it's nice to say, ""innocent until proven guilty."" and this bullshit line of thinking that it's rare is harmful for society. And has been the main cause of the \#MentorHer thing. Guys don't feel comfortable around women in a professional environment simply because of how easily they could lose their livelyhood from these girls with too much power to make someone guilty until proven innocent.

Now, have I had legal action against me? No. Have I had a girls falsely accuse me of stalking them/creeping/whatever? Yes. For the record, I tend to get lost in my own mind often.

Two isolated cases that I know of: 

The first is when me and my fraternity brother were doing a ""frat lap."" He was trying to get me to be more social and was thus making me go to all the parties. As a generally shy guy I was really uncomfortable and it definitely showed. Apparently, two girls whom I did not know (but now are friends due to who I married) thought I was following them from party to party as I would keep showing up. They dubbed me a creepy stalker and didn't change their minds until years later when they got to know me.

The second case involves me running on 48 hours of coffee fueled wakefulness and finally leaving the engineering lab at like 1am. I was walking back to my dorm wishing for bed when this girl in front of me took off in a full sprint. The next morning, with bags under my eyes and a coffee craddled close to my papers, three girls walked up to me and demanded to know why I was following one of them the night before. In my grumpiness I told them if I was gonna stalk someone I'd stalk someone hot, and to go fuck themselves and leave me alone to study. Tired me has no chill.

Being shy and nerdy has it's downfalls, the first and foremost being falsely accused quickly. Thankfully the wedding ring seems to have mitigated that."
"yo would u guys rather be forced to live life using a car with the music's volume stuck at 100, or live life only being able to be passive aggressive?"
"I'm wondering this too.

I'm an introvert with 0 friends. While I do like other people and social situations can be fun, I actively get out and talk to people only in meetup situations. It's not that I don't know how to go out and make friends (well, I don't, but that's not the issue). It's that I have no problems with being alone or the odd man out. 

I have a desire to be more social/outgoing, even if just to network and meet people who might help me in my career. But I have trouble balancing that out with my lack of care most days. It's weird."

"I was accused of ""forcing a female employee to let me look down her shirt"" by a female manager. When confronted by my DM and HR I said I knew who they were referring to and to ask the employee what happened. She had gotten a tattoo on the base her neck that went down between her shoulder blades and showed me thw part that covered up her ex's name whicj she had gotten when sje was young. I filed a complaint against the female manager and was reprimanded for ""retaliating.""

"I can relate to the men in your friend's experience.

I don't think of myself as hot or particularly attractive at all. I'm just average. I'm hygienic and a healthy weight, but I'm not muscular, I don't have that typical wide and manly jaw, and I'm super short. I'm also introverted, and I play tons of video games and watch anime and so on. I feel like I'd have no business trying to chat up a woman who's super conventionally attractive (all dolled up and in makeup and such). A woman like that seems like she would be pretty extroverted and social, and I'm not sure how well we could relate to each other when I'm just a nerdy shut-in.

On the other hand, I feel like someone who isn't super conventionally attractive (as in, not all dressed up and in makeup and such, but also isn't too overweight) is much more approachable. If you're outside just because you happen to have a reason to go outside (as opposed to enjoying being outside and social for its own sake), we might have a lot on common! If you're wearing a nerdy t-shirt, my heart will begin to flutter quite a bit and I'll *really* hope that I can get the chance to talk to you.

So I wouldn't call it 'intimidated', per se. It's just that, unless I have a reason to talk to a woman who's really attractive that's completely unrelated to how she's an attractive woman, I just don't feel like there'd be much of a point to approaching her, and I wouldn't want to impose on her day."

"It's easy to become part of the clergy when you're dating someone. You make one honest mistake and suddenly Jesus and the Holy spirit appear in front of you and try to push you away. They seem to think everyone needs to make room for them. 
'
What you need to do here is to not listen to them. Jesus is omnisexual and wants to get inside everyone. The Holy Spirit is a voyeur and wants to watch you and the one you fancy while you're doing it. 

Close your ears and tell Jesus to get the fuck out. As long as you're dating someone the Holy Spirit will be watching, so you just gotta get used to that. 

If you do give in and listen to Jesus, you'll become part of the clergy for as long as you're making space for Jesus. That way Jesus will always be the only one you're really making love to."

"I actually ""practiced"" PUA back when ""The Game"" by Neil Strauss came out.
I was active during the years 2005 - 2009/2010, during the ages of 15-19.

It definitely helped me get out of my shell and gain more confidence, because no matter what ""techniques"" you used you HAD TO GO OUT AND USE THEM.

Things like reading body language and tips on how to improve yourself regarding how to project more confidence, that pretty much all different ""schools"" of PUA teach, is pretty good. But all the scripts and other shit I think is mostly bullshit.

I don't recommend using PUA to meet women btw. It helped me but it also really fucked my view on women for quite some time. You really didn't see them as humans even, but as some sort of ""game"" that if you played it just right you could win sex from them.

It took some time to get out of that mindset and I wish I had focused more on self improvement than on chasing sex.

"I’ve found that being more “specific” in your style/aesthetic generally gets better results. Let me explain a bit more.

Currently, I have sort of a hipster look going on. I’ve got a decent beard, a mustache, earrings, and have a man bun in a lot of the time. This is in stark contrast to about a year ago when I was clean shaven, no earrings, and short(er) hair. Last year my “overall” attractiveness would probably average out to slightly above average/decent looking. Nothing special, but pretty well received for the most part.

Now, I have several polarizing things about the way I look. A lot of girls hate facial hair. A lot of girls hate man buns. And a lot of girls hate earrings. But a lot also really like these things. I’d say now, if you took an average sample of women and had them rate me 1-10, I’d probably be lower. But instead of most people rating me around 6-7, there are a lot that would be in the 8-10 range and a lot in the 1-5 range. And in my experience, that’s a lot more useful. The girls that *are* attracted to me now are very attracted, and have made the first move several times. I’ve definitely had way more success now than I did before."

"Also, isn't Logan kind of just like her dad? Especially with the Netflix series, and the way it ends(I'll try not to spoil it here) you kind of see the whole series just fall into this big cycle.

"I got up at 5am.  I'd make coffee and toast. In the shower. I'd call into voicemail and respond to voicemails while in the shower. There would typically be 20-30 of them. 

I'd get in the car around 6:15 and finish out the voicemails as I drove to work. I'd typically get to work around 7:30am. 

Between 7:30-8:00 I'd organize my day, get everything up and running on the computer, look for urgent emails, and have another cup of coffee. 

From 8am through 6pm, I'd be in meeting all day.  Typically there would be a meeting through lunch where lunch was provided. I'd respond through emails whenever there was a break or a lull. 

At 6pm, I'd reheat the leftovers I saved from lunch and would respond to emails while eating.  I'd typically finish emails around 8pm. (Typically I'd receive approximately 300 requests for information that required some research and response. )

I'd drive home, stopping st some place to get food. At home, I'd work from 9pm-1am doing all the work that I could t accomplish in a day. 

As I would get in bed, I'd respond to any emails before bed. If any of my coworkers were on we'd usually call each other and make any adjustments to spreadsheets or presentations. This would happen quite frequently, making my bed time anywhere between 1am and 2am. 

On weekends, I'd work most of the day Saturday from home. I'd have brunch with my friends on Sunday, and finish up any work that wasn't completed so I wouldn't be behind on any of my deadlines.

I worked this way for seven solid years complaining in every one on meeting with my manager.  

When I was asked to take on additional responsibilities that was outside of my scope, I balked. I got a meeting with the VP. My manager, assistant director, and director all had open calendars and an email about this meeting. None of them showed up. The VP basically told me that I'd be able to hire a consultant to take on the extra work and work on making improvements to the process. 

That year, in my performance review, the feedback was that I was insubordinate for having that meeting and I wasn't going to get a bonus or raise. They wanted to put me on a performance improvement plan. I quit. 


Now I work in TV and Film and Live Events. A lot less pay, and a working environment that many people would consider unreasonable. But after what I've been through, it's pure bliss. "

This is actually perfect.  Ask their wives and girlfriends to help you.  Go shopping with them and get some new clothes.  Go out with them and have them act as wing men for you.

* Asian guy kissing a girl.

* Asian guy who wasn't the villain, didn't do kung fu, didn't speak broken English, wasn't nerdy, wasn't a goofy sidekick, wasn't some old wise man master who talked like a fortune cookie.

* Asian guy who was actually cool and modern.

* Mysterious sexy femme fatale.

* Submissive lover to the white male protagonist.

* The bitch at the office.

My favorite part was at [6:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNCZ8sGJs8I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m33s), where they described young Filipino men as cool, well-dressed and smooth with the ladies.

"Well said, i also believe i have a closer relationship with my daughter than son. Its the dynamic of having two kids one girl and one boy. My wife is closer to my son. And it is true, ive talked to so many people who are scared about having kids who are terrible. But its all in how tou raise them. Teach them to make good decision, keep them active and above all else, love them. And truly appreciate and spend time with your kids. If you are not prepared to do all this. Then please dont have kids."
"I've done it once before and the best advice I can give you - just don't.

It started with drinking games at a house party from our coworker.  Turned into a nightmare once she got comfortable.  I couldnt get work out of her because it would always end up with an argument after work, sometimes even at work.  Other coworkers now see you hold zero authority.  If shes getting away with it, someone else will try it too.  I left my problems at the door because work is a business; unfortunately she was not able to do the same.  Everyone knew when we were fighting whether I wanted them to or not.

I also hated the fact we shared the same schedule.  I wake up with her, fight over the sink and shower, then whose driving to work in whose car.  I get off work and we have nothing to talk about because, well, she was there too.  

Some people may like that type of thing.  I enjoy a little space though.

"Not me personally, but I have a male friend in pre med and I overheard a couple of girls talking about him. They were also competing to get into med and they were joking about how they were gonna sleep with my buddy and then accuse him to sexual harassment later on so he wouldn't get in"
"Thanks for this reasonable alternative perspective! I had a similar experience. Im a very private person, i barely post on social media, and don’t actually have a relationship status listed. I was dating a guy a while ago who refused to change his relationship status from single because he “never changes it” and it turned out to be a red flag and we broke up for other reasons.

While it can be annoying sometimes, I think a lot of the social dynamics online are just extensions of social dynamics we have in person. Have you ever dated someone where it felt like they didn’t want to be seen with you? Only hung out with you when it was convenient for them? Social media can exacerbate insecurities but it’s also just a new platform for all the same old relationship dynamics to play out. 

Most of the posts on this thread are pretty off the wall but it’s also a part of being a good partner to have compassion when your partner is hurt about something and not just dismiss it. It might be a red flag for you that she’s upset that you don’t like her posts (not unreasonably), but it might be a red flag for her that you don’t want to be seen associating with her in public(-ish) and that youre not taking her seriously when she asks you about it (also not totally unreasonably)."
"Well I wasn’t knocked unconscious, my husband accidentally elbowed me in the back of the head when we were showering (he said he was distracted by my ass) and gave me a concussion.

I thought it was funnier than he did, I had a final the next morning and said, “if you gave me a concussion and I fail this final it’s on you.” And then I started to feel the concussion effects on my way home. I’ve had a severe concussion before so I knew what it was. 

The sad part is I cant tell very many people this story even though I think it’s funny because I don’t want them to think he beats me. "
"I’m actually reading a book about this right now, part of the idea of why we need face to face interactions and a sense of real community comes from how we evolved. 

If you were isolated from the pack, for whatever reason, you were in danger yourself but also you were putting your pack in danger as they needed you to help them survive. This is why people feel depressed or anxious when they have a lack of social connection. 

The book talks about how in communities with tight knit social groups, depression is far less frequent. In suburban areas where people don’t know their neighbors and feel isolated, they are far more likely to feel depressed or anxious.

The book is focused on depression and I do a bad job explaining it but, food for thought I guess?"
This guy fucks 
"She laughed and said matter-of-factly that she didn't see Asian men as men. I think she meant to say that she wasn't attracted to Asian men, but she said it in the worst possible way."
"I met my first love in college. She was my only love, but I wasn't ready to settle down. I wanted to party down with all my boys. We never put a label on it but we were ""together"" almost my entire sophomore year and we definitely went together like peas and carrots. 

Anyways I dropped out of college and she stayed, made more friends, dated and continued her life. I went on to meet a girl in another city and got engaged. This girl over the course of our 4 years together changed drastically. Completely selfish, never cared about me or asked how I was doing. Always drained our bank account, and I was very miserable. Around that time, and this is 7 years after college, my old sweetheart happened to move to the city I was living in. We hung out 3 times over 3 days, just catching up and laughing and having a great time (she hadn't changed a bit). I broke up with my fiance a week later and never looked back. We started dating and now are engaged with a wedding date set. We never even so much as fight, our relationship together is freaking beautiful in my own opinion. So luckily I got my first love back."
I agree with this. Being a gentleman always turns the heads of all the women in the room. 
"Yeah, even without knowing the full context of your dating and basing this of very few sentences that you wrote, she definitely seems too proud to be the type to apologies for her wrong doings."
"Female here,
I have about 5 close female friends.
2 of them have problems with, idk what to call it other than ‘social media addition’ or ‘phone addiction’.
Those two have self esteem issues :(
The other three don’t and often forget where their phone even is.

Me, personally, I have had streaks where I’m on it too much (hey I’m on it right now) and I usually notice pretty quickly and change my habits. I equate phone-addiction to smoking (former smoker here) in that you are a slave to your addiction, if it controls you, and it’s not even a living entity —and I don’t want to be controlled like that. So I don’t have Snapchat or twitter or Instagram. I do have Reddit and Facebook. Facebook is full of garbage but it’s a necessary evil for communicating with family &amp; friends- mostly Event invite information and sharing pictures. If there were another event and picture sharing platform that everyone used instead, I wouldn’t have a Facebook. 

But anyways,
Anytime I see one of the 2/5 friends posting too much on social media, it’s a direct sign to me that they’re going through a hard time feeling worthy. :( 
While posting on all platforms 5+ times a day is a huge turn off, it also lets me know they feel unheard or unseen or disconnected.

Generationally,  when my mother was growing up, all she saw were her immediate surroundings (no internet), and it was similar when I grew up until teenage years when MySpace and Facebook became a thing. But this was the early stages still and hadn’t taken hold and I didn’t get a smart phone until I was 22, maybe 23. 

But now kids are getting smart phones at 12 (or earlier). And since girls are raised and instinctually developed to be the socializing gender (playing house and with barbies as a kid), smart phones are the new socializing game/platform for this habit. I’m becoming the cliche old person who’s afraid for the future generations.

Also, cognitive distortions are a bitch.
And social media loves to highlight making the comparing yourself to other people one extremely prevalent. :(
Easy to sneak up on you, harder to get rid of!


This is already a long comment but I’d also like to add that one of the 2/5 friends went on a 30-day social media cleanse and has stuck to it (I think she’s on day 25), very proud of her! "

"Being entitled means to have a legitimate claim to a thing.  So you are entitled to service or products that you pay for.  You are entitled to, as /u/SupremeLeaderMay points out, basic human rights.  You are entitled to the government-provided services that you fund through taxes, so long as you meet whatever eligibility requirements are in place.

I know this may be nit-picking.  Many people that use the word in the way that you did understand that they are shortening the concept of a false sense of entitlement to a few words as possible.  But for some that is effectively changing the meaning of the actual word, to mean almost the opposite of its actual meaning."
"My personal ones I can think of off the top of my head.

* Drinking or drug abuse 

* Inability to stand up to peer pressure. or say no to her friends.

* History of cheating

* Being blatantly manipulative

* Romanticizing The Joker and Harley's relationship in anyway. "

if homegirl is wearing sweats to fancy dinners it's a completely different scenario than if she's wearing sweats to dairy queen or mini golf.

"It was April.  She came over and we watched the Muppet Movie.  We hit it off like crazy, but she concluded it by telling me that she was going to college 12 hours away at a Major Ivy League school and that she was NOT going to date a high school boy while surrounded by Major Ivy League guys.  This was just going to be a fun summer thing.  

I was OK with that because she was pretty goddamn amazing and any time with her was going to be time well spent.

It's now been about 23 consecutive summer things now, plus all the other seasons."

"Before I was married my girlfriend was wonderful but nothing prepaired her for my homecoming from Vietnam. I was shaking off opium and sleeping in a hammock in the yard due to vomiting. My dad let her walk out to say hi and I was 7/8th fucked up in a daze and went for her. My dad realised his error and stopped me with a shovel to the back. He physically laid on me and I tossed him like a toy supposedly, my mom yelled my name and I fell to the ground crying. In the commotion I smashed Donnas head (my gf) she was stone cold out our neighbor a MD. Gave me valium and took care of her, I hated myself."

Copy and paste from my old comment that did pretty well: We flirted a lot freshman year and had two classes together. Sophomore year I had a single apartment and had this awesome idea to put a queen bed and a twin bed together to make a giant bed. Anyway she heard about and wanted to try it out. I was busy and was kinda seeing someone else so never made time. Later on in the year she asked to come by and take a nap after her test. I said sure! She came by and fell onto the bed. She asked me to join her and I said okay. Being the perfect gentleman I went to the opposite end. I promptly fell asleep. She left in a huff shortly after and we kinda stopped chatting after that. In my defense I was a pretty clueless guy that lacked the experience or confidence to have gone for it. She used to bring me delicious baked goods too.

"The problem isn't that you sound condescending, arrogant, or judgemental. The problem is that you are being condescending, arrogant, and judgemental. It isn't just the ""the way it comes across"", it's your whole behavior or attitude in these situations, and while you may not be doing it intentionally and you probably don't notice it, it's something you have to change about yourself before it'll go away. Maybe you're being defensive, or maybe you feel attacked, but something is causing it."

"My problem wouldn't be worrying that you haven't broken free but would be 90% about privacy. I think it's really nice that you want to take care of your mom and in a different situation (like a 2 family), it would be endearing to me. However, how do you get to know someone when you can't be completely free in their home? You can't snuggle on the couch or walk naked to the bathroom. Consider different options that would give you privacy. "
Not hiding vulnerability
"I'm gonna preface this by saying by saying I'm not an attractive dude. I'm a fat dude who is bald and lives by himself. I have been having pretty decent success on POF and Tinder the last few months. 

I'm not looking for one night stands fwiw, I'm 30 and done with that portion of my life. 

Everyone on those apps use stupid pick up lines from /r/tinder (I'm going to complain to Spotify)
Or it's just a lazy introductions like ""Hey how are you?""

Look at her profile. Be selective. Stay in your lane. Find something in her profile that you can relate to. 2 days ago I found a girl that mentioned playing N64 games and I challenged her to a Mario Kart competition. We exchanged numbers, have been hitting it off, and are planning a date next weekend. 

Just be genuine, do your homework, and put in some actual effort. And if you're not feeling the spark after some conversation, just tell them you're not interested and move on. No one wants to be ghosted. "
"One time a girl made a joke about stealing my heart and kissed me on the dancefloor.

At the time I was wearing a small LED screen which was displaying a heart gif.  It's fun at parties, but it cost like $100, so I quickly left to get a drink under the assumption she was legitimately trying to steal my heart and facepalmed later.

A few times women have asked me how I'm still single, and I've replied honestly with my tragic backstory.

Probably the worst case was when an older woman asked me to drinks after a group dinner, paid my tab, held me close for warmth, kissed me, etc.  I'm not entirely sure if it counts because after the first kiss I had an idea, but then she was like ""nah it's just a kiss doesn't mean anything"" and I assumed maybe it's just a cultural thing as she pretended her phone was dead so I'd call us an uber, kissed me again and said I was beautiful before the driver closed the door, waited a few long moments assuming I'd be going with her, and driving off into the night never to be seen again.

"Also saying that your always late is a way of saying she doesn’t care about herself as well as others. She knows it’s wrong, but rather than putting in effort to fix it, she just makes it one of her “quirks”."

"1/3 of women are most definitely not morbidly obese. Obese, yes. Morbidly obese is medical term that a much smaller portion of the population fits into (about 5% iirc). 

Also if you're looking at white/Asian women in their 20s, the numbers are much, much lower. Most of those women are a healthy weight.

"This is so true. My girlfriend is my life partner. She makes living so much easier. Simple things, like looking up directions so I can drive us to dinner. Loading the dishwasher and running it so I can unload it. Replacing the trash bag when I take out the trash. Little shit that’s either dunking when you throw the ball up or putting you in a position for an easy lay up. It changes everything.

It also helps to know she believes in me. Whatever I want to do, she believes in me. It helps me believe in myself.

If I can also add a comment on LTRs - it’s so crucial to look at yourself in the mirror and recognize the only person you need to impress is her. If she loves the way you look, nothing else matters. "

"I was where you were at before, I bet almost everyone was, I did not want a job at first, it felt like just another responsibility to eat up my free time, but having money allowed me to buy a car, and have money always, I made a few good friends and it was all in all a good experience. But finding a first job you enjoy is borderline impossible, there is a reason kids can’t get jobs that pay good wages, and you’ll end up doing something kind of shitty"

"She refused to call my first girlfriend my girlfriend because she wasn't the same race as me, even though we have been dating for more than a year by that time. Instead,  she asked when will I get an proper girlfriend and only referred to my girlfriend as my very good friend. 

When she said that, I told her that, ""Yea, we're ""very good"" friends indeed."" And my mother just went rolled her eyes and went back to whatever she was doing. "
I was a general manager at a pizza place I told a girl to do 10-4 min of dishes then she could go home (everybody did dishes before going home) she was dating a manager at the time and felt that was below her. She told the owner that I tried to initiate a 3 some with her and a cashier. Only reason she wasn't believed is because we have cameras with audio and the cashier backed me up. 
Well my gf pointed it out to me and was like that’s another exhibit of me being oblivious. She didn’t think it was anything to worry about though. 
Hoodies can be pretty expensive too though
"I would appreciate her not ever mentioning my dick to anyone. 

I once made a comment about something (some random object, I don't remember what) being small and my brother turned it into a small dick joke. This was while we were all in town visiting my parents. I just laugh it off and my wife makes some comment like ""Oh trust me, it's not"" or some shit. 

My brother making a small dick joke is normal, and something everyone can shrug off. Her commenting that my dick is a great size to my brother and parents is not normal. It's freaking weird and I just wanted that moment to end as quickly as possible. 

I would prefer that nobody hear details like that about our sex lives. Good or bad. Friends family or strangers don't need to know. 

Also there is a couple in our friend group where the girlfriend will bring up sex and how great her bf is at every chance she gets. Like randomly working in the number of orgasms she had last weekend into a casual conversation that we are all having while watching a baseball game or something. No. You're gross. We don't care and it sounds like you are over exaggerating due to insecurities."
